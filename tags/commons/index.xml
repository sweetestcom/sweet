        <description>Podcast Description Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed Queen of Canada, is unlike almost any other cult leader Canada has ever seen. In an incredibly short amount of time, she’s been able to gain a mass following, despite her absurd claims and alarming rhetoric.
At various points, she’s claimed to be a political leader, a monarch, an interdimensional being communing with aliens, and so much more. She’s urged her followers to take up arms and execute migrants on sight.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Multi-level marketing isn’t based on rational business logic. It’s not even built on irrational business logic. It’s ideology. It’s faith.
MLMs have become such a ubiquitous part of North American life that their tenets are rarely ever questioned. The sector holds enormous political sway. Millions of people join, leave and rejoin every year, almost all of them ending up poorer for the experience.
And to call it a cult is not just a cute turn of phrase.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Nearly 1.4 million Canadians and almost 50 million Americans are involved in multi-level marketing. And that sheer volume of people makes it a near certainty that you’ve encountered MLMs in your life somehow.
The promise of financial freedom can be an intoxicating lure. But MLMs, like so many other cultish enterprises, are about more than just money. They’re about transcendence.
And in their wake, they often leave behind ruined livelihoods and broken lives.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mary-Jayne Blackmore is one of the oldest children of Winston Blackmore, the most famous polygamist in Canada.&amp;nbsp;
For decades, her family has been the subject of intense media and legal scrutiny because of her father’s 27 wives and 150 children. Their lives have been dissected in documentaries and in court testimony.
The name Blackmore has become synonymous with either faith-based persecution by the state or with cult-like religious fundamentalism that victimizes girls and women.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1973, a French motorsports journalist claimed to have been visited by a UFO that revealed to him the secret origins of humanity. For the next half-century, the man known as Raël would go on to create a new faith with tens of thousands of adherents all around the world.&amp;nbsp;
The media have portrayed the Raelians as not just a cult, but a strange phantasmagoria of extraterrestrials, orgies and clones.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An explosion of new spiritual movements in the 1970s led to the creation of an entirely novel academic field. But right from the beginning, the discipline was riven asunder.
The Cult Wars have been raging for decades. They’re fought not only in academic journals and conference seminars, but in the press, the courts and in legislative assemblies. And their battles continue to have enormous consequences.

        <description>Podcast Description In the 1960s and 70s, there was a fear that cult leaders were brainwashing young people into joining their new, strange movements. But is it even possible to “brainwash” anyone?
At a psychiatric hospital in Montreal, one mad scientist, with the help of the CIA, tried to find out.

        <description>Podcast Description The story of Brother XII still fascinates and even frightens some people in and around Nanaimo.
He’s often called the Devil of De Courcy Island for good reason.
Brother XII prophesied about the coming apocalypse. But instead, his story would presage something different. He was a forerunner of the strange, new religions that would sweep over the western world.

        <description>Podcast Description As organized religion declines in countries like Canada, we’ve experienced an explosion of what some call religious movements and what others call cults.
The idea of cults has become an omnipresent part of our discourse. But what even is a cult? And why have we become so intrigued by these groups?
And the language of cults has moved beyond just religion into so many different spheres — everything from fitness, to politics, to work.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Derek Boogaard made his living pummeling people on the ice. But outside the arena, he was soft-spoken and kind.
Fighting was just his job. But it would end up taking everything from him.
Hockey fights, and the numerous blows to the head that players have to endure, have become a moral crisis at the very heart of the sport. And the NHL is doing everything they can to deny the science and allow this gladiatorial combat to continue.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Hockey Canada scandal has become one of the biggest stories in the country. And now, hockey appears to be in the middle of a reckoning. But this isn’t the first time. There was another moment, just like this one.
Back then, people tried to warn the hockey world — they were ignored. And even today, the sport won’t name the very specific issue they face.&amp;nbsp;
Hockey has a gang rape problem.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mike Danton was playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the St. Louis Blues. And at the same time, he was trying to hire a hitman to kill his agent, David Frost.
Danton’s arrest and conviction would become one of the biggest hockey scandals of all time. But this is not just some salacious true crime story.&amp;nbsp;
It’s an extreme example of everything that’s wrong with hockey culture; hazing and abuse, sexual misconduct and the adult men who control the lives of teenage boys for their own monetary gain.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Justin Davis was never a superstar. He was a journeyman player, one of tens of thousands, chasing the dream. And at almost every step, when hockey gave him something, it would also take something away.
Hockey exacts a heavy toll on many boys and young men — on their minds and their bodies. And then they’re told not to talk about any of it outside the locker room.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The NHL likes to call Willie O’Ree the Jackie Robinson of hockey. And no one can deny how significant it was when he became the first Black player on the ice in an NHL game in 1958.&amp;nbsp;
But what the league doesn’t like to talk about is what happened next.&amp;nbsp;
Because after O’Ree, the NHL didn’t admit another black player for sixteen years. So did the NHL resegregate? And why don’t we talk about the experiences of the players who broke hockey’s second colour line?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Of the estimated 7000 people who have played in the NHL only around 100 of them have been Black. That’s an absurdly low number compared to any other major North American sports league.
But what makes that statistic especially shocking is the fact that the modern game has its roots with Black players on Black teams.
The Coloured Hockey League wasn’t just a sideshow to the main event of white hockey.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hockey is a hell of a lot of fun. But right now, the sport is going through a reckoning. Allegations of racism, corruption, sexual misconduct and so much more are rocking the game to its core.
But the truth is that in Canada, hockey is more than just a sport. It’s a civic religion, with a billion dollar business attached to it.
Over the next seven episodes, COMMONS will be digging into the cult of hockey, scrutinizing its doctrines and exposing its secrets.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For almost a century, the Irving family has run New Brunswick like a personal fiefdom. They own the newspapers, the industry, and, according to some, even the government. So how does a single family come to so thoroughly dominate an entire province? And what happens when that family starts to fracture and split apart at the seams?

Attawapiskat has become famous across Canada and around the world. Not for the natural beauty that surrounds it, or for the Cree culture of the people who live there. Instead, it’s become a byword for the toxic legacy of Canadian colonialism.
But while Attawapiskat faced crisis after crisis, the community was sitting on a literal diamond mine run by the world’s most famous mining company.</description>

Who are the Rogers family? How did they get so powerful? Why have they turned against one another? And what does it matter?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve spent a week immersed in Rogers history to bring you this unofficial narrative of Canada&#39;s telecom overlords.

Matthew Boswell is the Competition Commissioner. And he&#39;s the last man trying to stand in the way of the mega-merger between Rogers and Shaw.&amp;nbsp;
But even he acknowledges that Canada&#39;s antitrust laws aren&#39;t just inadequate — they&#39;re weighted in favour of the monopolists.
A frank discussion with Canada&#39;s top competition cop.

        <description>Podcast Description Rogers and Shaw are getting ready to tie the knot. But before they can consummate their less-than-holy union, they have to get the approval of Canada’s competition tribunal and the federal government. And even though most Canadians would find this union highly objectionable, it’s likely to be approved.
Because for 150 years, Canadian politicians have been talking out of both sides of their mouths. They claim they want to promote competition.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WIND Mobile, now known as Freedom, was a small company that tried to break through Canada’s telecom oligopoly. It did not have an easy ride.&amp;nbsp;
WIND faced numerous hurdles from regulators, it was subjected to dirty tricks from the telecom oligopoly, and was eventually sold to Shaw. But it also helped lower cell phone rates and brought in unlimited data and U.S. roaming, changing the wireless market permanently.</description>

Despite repeated denials by senior government and military officials, there&#39;s evidence that many Canadians knew they were sending Afghans to be tortured.

But then why did so many Afghans join with the Taliban during the years that Canada was fighting in Kandahar?&amp;nbsp;
And if the Taliban were our enemies, who exactly were our friends and allies? In many cases, they were torturers, rapists and murderers themselves.</description>

But the soldiers and commanders on the ground have a different story to tell. A rushed battle. Flawed intelligence. And generals putting political considerations ahead of Canadian lives.&amp;nbsp;

That would have profound consequences.&amp;nbsp;
Within months, Canadian special forces were participating in secret operations at the behest of some of the most sinister men in the country.
Our actions in the early days of the war would go on to endanger the lives of Afghans and Canadian soldiers alike in the years to come.</description>

When the Taliban marched into Kabul last August, the world watched as Afghans clung to planes in an attempt to escape. We bring you the true story of the end of one of the forever wars through the eyes of the people who were there.</description>

It&#39;s hard to wrap your head around the atrocities that people in Porgera have suffered over the last thirty year. Environmental devastation. Murder as a matter of course. Hundreds of women and girls who have been raped.</description>

Attawapiskat has become famous across Canada and around the world. Not for the natural beauty that surrounds it, or for the Cree culture of the people who live there. Instead, it&#39;s become a byword for the toxic legacy of Canadian colonialism.
But while Attawapiskat faced crisis after crisis, the community was sitting on a literal diamond mine run by the world&#39;s most famous mining company.</description>

A monster has been haunting the North.
Giant Mine may be a big reason why Yellowknife exists. But for seven decades, it&#39;s been a unique source of suffering for the people in the region.
Three stories from this uniquely haunted place: the damage it did when it opened, the bloodiest labour dispute in Canadian history, and the toxic legacy that may remain for thousands of years.</description>

Twenty-six men were working underground when an explosion tore through the Westray Mine in Nova Scotia. Their friends and colleagues went into the wreckage to try to save them.
The story of Westray is one of managerial malice and the heroism of everyday people. But why is it that governments let this happen over and over again, at the expense of so many lives?</description>

A tiny Canadian mining company discovers the largest gold deposit in human history. But when the company&#39;s chief geologist falls out of a helicopter over the Indonesian jungle, it was all revealed to be a mirage.
Bre-X was a national obsession that made many overnight millionaires. It also happened to be the biggest fraud in the history of mining.&amp;nbsp;
But questions still remain. Why did no one go to jail?</description>

For a century, Canada was one of the world&#39;s leading exporters of asbestos, most of it mined from the small town of Asbestos, Quebec. But during that time, governments and corporations in Canada did everything they could to hide the fact that asbestos is deadly.
They went to extraordinary lengths &amp;mdash; secret organ smuggling, corporate-supervised police torture &amp;mdash; to keep the ugly truth from the world.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over 25 years, WE built a golden brand by inspiring children to rally around their charismatic leader. But behind the scenes, employees experienced a cult-like culture and a troubling blur of charitable and commercial activities. In the aftermath of a national scandal, thousands of donors and volunteers (and dozens of &amp;lsquo;celebrity ambassadors&#39;) are left wondering where the money went, and whether the savior industry creates a constant need for victims.</description>

But journalists and NGOs have long alleged that one man, Abdul Taib Mahmud, has benefitted from that destruction to the tune of billions of dollars. If that&#39;s true, it&#39;s one of the worst acts of corruption in the modern era.

But the long saga of Eddy Haymour is at its heart a story of obsession. About a man who became consumed by his dreams for a piece of land. And about a government equally determined to stop him at any cost.

But that image obscures the profound power the Mounties have held throughout Canadian history. And the dark legacy of ethnic cleansing and genocide at their core.

        <description>Podcast Description Julian Fantino may be the most famous cop in Canadian history. He was the chief of four different police forces. And for decades, he was one of the most influential voices in law enforcement. But during his rise, people critical of the police had a way of finding themselves in the crosshairs. They were smeared, surveilled, intimidated and arrested.
The police are a singularly powerful institution in this country.</description>

In the final episode in our series about the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in long-term care, we’re going to tell you a different kind of story. A story of hope. About how the people we treat as disposable, can have lives of joy and dignity. And about one place where they were given exactly that.

Four months after the first outbreak in a Canadian nursing home, over 7000 long-term residents have died of COVID-19. But if you look at the news or social media or our political debates, it seems like we’ve already moved on. Maybe that’s because it feels like this kind of tragedy was inevitable during a pandemic. It wasn’t. And we know that because in some places in Canada, politicians and public health officials made decisions that saved hundreds, if not thousands of lives.</description>

Long-term care workers are in the vanguard in the war against COVID-19. They’re not the kinds of workers who get movies or TV shows made about them. In fact, their stories are rarely told. But not only are they battling heroically against this pandemic. They’re fighting for recognition and respect within a system built to marginalize them. COMMONS: Pandemic is currently focusing on how COVID-19 is affecting long-term care in Canada.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over 1700 Ontarians have already been killed by COVID-19. And the vast majority of them died in long-term care. But if you live in a private, for-profit home, you’re much more likely to die from this virus. The for-profit long-term care industry is politically powerful and deeply entrenched. Is this their moment of reckoning?

Because we should have known that was going to be the case, but we let it happen anyways.

        <description>Podcast Description They call themselves the Canadian Kennedys. And they’re one of the most famous political dynasties to ever exist in this country. But the rise of the Ford family has been marred by violence and self-destruction at almost every turn. The story of the Fords is tragic — for them, for everyone who falls into their orbit, and for the people of Toronto.

And what happens when that family starts to fracture and split apart at the seams?

        <description>Podcast Description If you look at the stats, Canada has a low incidence of hate crimes, but the numbers that we rely on to tell us if we&#39;re racist or not are wrong.

        <description>Podcast Description The acquittal of Gerald Stanley in the shooting of Colten Boushie sparked outrage across Canada. The anger was further fuelled by the fact that the jury was all white, in a community that had a significant Indigenous population. After the Gerald Stanley verdict, the government proposed sweeping changes to the legal system in Bill C-75. The legal community has been divided on these proposed changes - some say they are an important first step to make juries more diverse, while other say they will actually make things worse.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Liberals put forth a proposal to tax the hell out of small businesses. At least that&#39;s how it&#39;s being painted by the Opposition.
In reality, the proposed changes would have virtually zero impact on the majority of small business owners, but would focus on self-incorporated doctors. And it wouldn&#39;t raise their taxes, per se, but alter how they can claim their family members as employees, and change how the money they park in investments rather than being poured back into their businesses is assessed.</description>

Also, we look at the summer political stories that evolved while we were on hiatus: the Charlottesville tragedy and subsequent events in Canada, the influx of asylum seekers crossing the border and Trudeau&#39;s cabinet shuffle which may have just doubled the bureaucracy for Indigenous peoples.</description>

In the end, two prominent magazine editors were gone from their posts, and the debate about the under-representation of non-white voices in Canadian media got significant traction.
But Commons is a show about politics, so we asked CBC columnist and head of TIFF Cinematheque Jesse Wente how appropriation is represented in the Canadian political sphere.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Andrew Loku was shot and killed by police last July. But the public doesn’t know who did it.
When the Special Investigations Unit announced that the officer who killed him would not face charges, it led to a protest organised by Black Lives Matter Toronto that has lasted over a week, day and night, through rain and an ice storm. Protestors have gathered from around the country, demanding for the name of the officer who killed Andrew Loku to be released and for more accountability when police kill or beat black citizens.</description>
