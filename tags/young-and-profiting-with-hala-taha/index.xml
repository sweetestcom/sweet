        <description>Podcast Description We’re told from a young age that we should follow our dreams and do what we love. However, too many people give up after their first roadblock or abandon their dreams altogether. When we leave our passions behind or stop trying, we are building an unfulfilling life for ourselves. What does it look like to follow your dreams, even if those dreams keep changing? Hala Taha is the perfect example of somebody who reached for the stars in everything she did, and sometimes fell right back where she started.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When we enter a negotiation of any kind, we have to consider much more than what we are saying.

By paying close attention to all verbal and nonverbal factors of a negotiation, you improve the likelihood of getting the outcome you want. Chris Voss is a globally-renowned negotiation coach who founded The Black Swan Group, where he’s using his many years of experience in international crises and high-stakes negotiations to teach people and businesses how to better negotiate and refine their communication styles.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are two types of entrepreneurs: those who copy other people’s businesses and those who create an entirely new market. When you disrupt an existing market, you run the risk of being lumped in with your competitors. For example, you can probably name five of your local coffee shops off the top of your head. While some entrepreneurs thrive off of copying other business ideas, the most successful businesses are the ones who solve a problem that nobody else has solved.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are several common misconceptions about generating wealth. For example, many people believe that becoming an expert in one skill will set them up for success, when in reality, having multiple skills under your belt will give you a unique portfolio that is more desirable to employers and customers. Additionally, too many young people let thousands of dollars go to waste by sitting in a savings account. In today’s economy, investing is necessary to generate lasting wealth.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Regret is one of the most common negative emotions we experience as humans. Yet, most people are reluctant to explore or even talk about their regrets with others because of the growing ‘no regrets’ philosophy that demonizes the presence of regret. However, when used properly, regret can be a powerful tool by illuminating where our values and priorities lie, which can help us avoid making the same mistakes in the future.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Negotiations don’t always take place in a conference room. A negotiation is simply a discussion where both parties come to an agreement, so we are negotiating all the time. Something as small as talking to family about who’s bringing what to Christmas dinner is a negotiation! And negotiations are not entirely verbal. Whether we realize it or not, we are influencing every negotiation with how we present ourselves. Through paying more attention to our body language, our word choice, and the way we frame information, we can intentionally evoke more information from others, which can help us establish trust and build stronger relationships!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Too many people are stuck in the past: old ideas, old technologies, and old ways of living. When we don’t embrace change, we don’t grow or evolve. Accepting change and using it to fuel our growth is one of the most important things we can do for ourselves in every area of our lives. But how can we resist our natural inkling toward predictability and become comfortable with change?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Since the 1970s, we have viewed business as a way to make money, not make a difference. However, the way we view the role of business is changing. Some of the most successful entrepreneurs believe that purpose is the primary function of business, not profits. If your career and your organization exist solely to make money, you will likely lose motivation to keep going after you’ve met all your major milestones.</description>

It keeps our conscious minds from being overwhelmed with too much information by acting as a doorway between our conscious mind and our subconscious mind. Our RAS determines what’s important to us by examining our past experiences. If your past is filled with pain, trauma, and limiting beliefs, then that’s what your RAS will seek out.</description>
