But in 2002, a single study, its design imperfect, found links between hormone therapy and elevated health risks for women of all ages. Panic set in; in one year, the number of prescriptions plummeted.
Hormone therapy carries risks, to be sure, as do many medications that people take to relieve serious discomfort, but dozens of studies since 2002 have provided reassurance that for healthy women under 60 whose hot flashes are troubling them, the benefits of taking hormones outweigh the risks.</description></item><item><title>How Sports Betting Hit the Mainstream in America | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210232/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210232/</guid><description>Podcast Description This weekend, one of the most watched sporting events of the year, the Super Bowl, will draw an estimated $16 billion in bets from Americans, more than double last year’s total.

In the 1980s, the list price of undergraduate education at a private four-year institution could hit $20,000 a year. At some of these schools in the last couple of years, it has topped $80,000.

The state of the war is eerily stalled and the Russians’ answer has been to encircle cities and, from a distance, bomb what they can’t control.

For six decades, Mr. Sondheim, a composer-lyricist whose works include “Sweeney Todd” and “Into the Woods,” transformed musical theater into an art form as rich, complex and contradictory as life itself.
“For me, the loss that we see pouring out of Twitter right now and everywhere you look as people write about their memories of Sondheim is for that person who says yes, devoting yourself to writing or to dancing or to singing or to composing — or whatever it is — is a worthwhile life,” Jesse Green, The Times’s chief theater critic, said in today’s episode.</description></item><item><title>The Supreme Court Considers the Future of Roe | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210597/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210597/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard a case that was a frontal challenge to Roe v.

The case in front of the justices was about a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
For the state to win, the court, which now has a conservative majority, would have to do real damage to the central tenet of the Roe ruling.</description></item><item><title>Amazon and the Labor Shortage | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210598/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 10:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210598/</guid><description>Podcast Description Amazon is constantly hiring. Data has shown that the company has had a turnover rate of about 150 percent a year.
For the founder, Jeff Bezos, worker retention was not important, and the company built systems that didn’t require skilled workers or extensive training — it could hire and lose people all of the time.

She helped design an Olympics opening ceremony, served as the official artist in residence for NASA, made an opera out of “Moby-Dick” and played a concert for dogs at the Sydney Opera House.</description></item><item><title>The Great Supply Chain Disruption | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210635/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 09:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210635/</guid><description>Podcast Description Throughout the pandemic, businesses of all sizes have faced delays, product shortages and rising costs linked to disruptions in the global supply chain. Consumers have been confronted with an experience rare in modern times: no stock available, and no idea when it will come in.
Our correspondent, Peter Goodman, went to one of the largest ports in the United States to witness the crisis up close. In this episode, he explains why this economic havoc might not be temporary — and could require a substantial refashioning of the world’s shipping infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>‘No Crime Is Worth That’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210636/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210636/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language and descriptions of violence.
A Times investigation has uncovered extraordinary levels of violence and lawlessness inside Rikers, New York City’s main jail complex. In this episode, we hear about one man’s recent experience there and ask why detainees in some buildings now have near-total control over entire units.

When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August, our producer started making calls. With the help of colleagues, she contacted women in different cities and towns to find out how their lives had changed and what they were experiencing.
Then she heard from N, whose identity has been concealed for her safety.
This is the story of how one 18-year-old woman’s life has been transformed under Taliban rule.</description></item><item><title>Is Child Care a Public Responsibility? | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210638/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210638/</guid><description>Podcast Description Many Americans pay more for child care than they do for their mortgages, even though the wages for those who provide the care are among the lowest in the United States.
Democrats see the issue as a fundamental market failure and are pushing a plan to bridge the gap with federal subsidies.
We went to Greensboro, N.C., to try to understand how big the problem is and to ask whether it is the job of the federal government to solve.</description></item><item><title>Which Towns Are Worth Saving? | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210639/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 09:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210639/</guid><description>Podcast Description An enormous infusion of money and effort will be needed to prepare the United States for the changes wrought by the climate crisis.

He was accustomed to working long days during the postelection certification process, but November 2020 was different.
President Trump was demanding recounts. His allies had spent months stoking fears of election fraud. And then, on Nov. 8, Sidney Powell, a lawyer representing the Trump campaign, appeared on Fox News and claimed, without evidence, that Dominion had an algorithm that switched votes from Trump to Joe Biden.</description></item><item><title>A Troubling C.I.A.

A month ago, Texas adopted a divisive law which effectively banned abortions in the state. Despite a number of legal challenges, the law has survived and is having an impact across state lines.
Trust Women is abortion clinic in Oklahoma just three hours north of Dallas — one of the closest clinics Texas women can go to.
On the day the Texas law came into effect, “it was like a light had been flipped,” said one of the workers who staffs the clinic’s phone lines.</description></item><item><title>The Democrats Who Might Block Biden’s Infrastructure Plan | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210648/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210648/</guid><description>Podcast Description The first year of a Congress is usually the best time for a president to put forward any sort of ambitious policy.

Brig. Gen. Khoshal Sadat, a former Afghan deputy minister for security, has held some of the highest ranks in the Afghan security forces and government.
From the moment Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, the United States has put much of the blame of Afghan security forces — a force that President Biden said gave up without a fight.
“The reality is that we’re not cowards,” said General Sadat.</description></item><item><title>Another Crisis at the Border | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210651/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 09:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210651/</guid><description>Podcast Description Increasing numbers of Haitian migrants have been traveling to the border town of Del Rio, Texas, recently, in the hope of entering the United States.
Border Patrol took action — in some cases, sending the migrants back to Haiti; in others, taking them into custody or releasing them as they await trial.
Why did so many thousands of Haitians come to the border in the first place?

In those years, Ms. Merkel has not only served as the leader of Germany, but also as a leader of Europe, facing down huge challenges — such as the eurozone and the refugee crises — all while providing a sense of stability.

More than any other contemporary composer, he appears to have the whole of music history at his command, shifting easily between vocabularies, often in the same film.
His most arresting scores tend to fuse both ends of his musical education. “Succession” is 18th-century court music married to heart-pounding beats; “Moonlight” chops and screws a classical piano-and-violin duet as if it’s a Three 6 Mafia track.</description></item><item><title>A Broadway Show Comes Back to Life | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210659/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210659/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
“Six,” a revisionist feminist British pop musical about the wives of King Henry VIII, was shaping up to be a substantial hit on Broadway after finding success in London.
On its opening night, however, in March 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a shutdown of theater that would wind up lasting a year and a half.

But her company collapsed, and she was accused of lying about how well Theranos’s technology worked. Now she is on trial on fraud charges.

The Supreme Court ruling is a milestone for Mexico’s feminist movement.

Terry Albury joined the F.B.I. just before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, drawn in by the bureau’s work fighting child exploitation. His role quickly changed after 9/11 however, and he subsequently spent over a decade working in counterterrorism.
Around 2015, he began to deeply question his work. “This is not what I joined the F.B.I. to do,” he recalled thinking.

As the last of the American forces left under the cover of darkness, there was celebratory gunfire from the Taliban. The moment of exit, a day earlier than expected, was both historic and anticlimactic.

And at the beginning of the semester, things seemed to be going OK. But then a spike in coronavirus cases hit town, putting the school’s safety plan to the test.
In part three of our four-part series, we follow what happened when a student quarantine stretched the school’s nurses to capacity, fractured friendships and forced some marching band members to miss a critical rite of passage: the last football game of their high school career.</description></item><item><title>The Case Against Derek Chauvin | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210797/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210797/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Minneapolis, the tension is palpable as the city awaits the outcome of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer accused of murdering George Floyd last summer.

A number of animal species possess beautifully conspicuous and physically burdensome features.
Many biologists have long fit these tasking aesthetic displays into a more utilitarian view of evolution. However, a new generation of biologists have revived a long-ignored theory — that aesthetics and survival do not necessarily need to be linked and that animals can appreciate beauty for its own sake.</description></item><item><title>Bonus: The N-Word is Both Unspeakable and Ubiquitous.

It was always going to be a tense day in Washington. In the baseless campaign to challenge Joe Biden’s victory, Wednesday had been framed by President Trump and his allies as the moment for a final stand.

Caity Weaver, the author of this week’s Sunday Read, says that to properly embrace this year’s cinematic achievements, the Academy Awards should not only hand out accolades to new releases, but also to the older films that sustained us through this period.
If they did, Caity argues, Cher would be on course to win a second Oscar for her performance as Loretta Castorini in 1987’s “Moonstruck” — a film that, under lockdown, was a salve to many.</description></item><item><title>24 Hours Inside a Brooklyn Hospital: An Update | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210883/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210883/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.

The response was overwhelming. Audio messages poured into our inboxes from around the world, with multiple emails arriving every minute.

The Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia will determine whether two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, keep their seats. If their Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and the Rev.

For nearly four years, the U.S. government has tried to discourage migrants, with reinforced walls, family separation policies and threats of deportation.
Those policies have led to the appearance of a makeshift asylum-seeker camp of frayed tents and filthy conditions within walking distance of the United States.</description></item><item><title>‘It Has All Gone Too Far’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210898/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 19:32:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210898/</guid><description>Podcast Description The state of the 2020 U.S. election is, still, not a settled matter in Georgia. For weeks, conservatives have been filing lawsuits in state and federal courts in an effort to decertify results that gave a victory to Joe Biden. On Twitter, President Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims that the state has been “scammed.”
With Georgia in political turmoil, threats of violence have been made against state election officials, who have been scrambling to recount votes by hand, and against their families.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: ‘The Social Life of Forests’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210899/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210899/</guid><description>Podcast Description Foresters once regarded trees as solitary individuals: They competed for space and resources, but were otherwise indifferent to one another.
The work of the Canadian ecologist Suzanne Simard upended that, finding that while there is indeed conflict in a forest, there is also negotiation, reciprocity and even selflessness.
Ms. Simard discovered that underground fungal threads link nearly every tree in a forest.

With his term coming to an end, the president has discussed granting three of his children, his son-in-law and personal lawyer pre-emptive pardons — a rarity in American history. We look ahead to a potential wave of pardons and commutations — and explore who could benefit.</description></item><item><title>‘Something Terrible Has Happened’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210901/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 07:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210901/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains descriptions of sexual assault.
When the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy this year, it created a final window for claims of sexual abuse against the organization’s leaders.
Within nine months, nearly 100,000 victims filed suits — that far eclipses the number of sexual-abuse allegations that the Roman Catholic Church faced in the early 2000s.
Today, we hear from one of the victims, Dave Henson, a 40-year-old naval officer who was sexually abused for five years by one of his scout troop’s leaders.</description></item><item><title>Biden’s Cabinet Picks, Part 2: Antony Blinken | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210902/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 07:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210902/</guid><description>Podcast Description What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump?
Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak, but some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend.
If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States can be counted on.</description></item><item><title>Biden’s Cabinet Picks, Part 1: Janet Yellen | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210903/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 07:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210903/</guid><description>Podcast Description Janet Yellen, who is poised to become secretary of the Treasury, will immediately have her work cut out for her. The U.S. economy is in a precarious state and Congress is consumed by partisan politics.
Ms. Yellen, however, is no stranger to crisis.

A coronavirus vaccine may be just weeks away.
According to Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to accelerate vaccine development, the first Americans could receive the vaccine in mid-December.
With the vaccine within reach, we turn to more logistical questions: Who will receive the shots first? Who will distribute them?

His team filed a litany of court cases in battleground states. In some, such as Georgia and Michigan, the president and his allies took an even more bullish approach, attempting to use their influence to bear down on election officials.
As preparations for the transfer of power finally get underway, we take a look at how the Trump campaign’s attempts to overturn the election played out.</description></item><item><title>New York City’s 3 Percent Problem | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210907/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 07:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210907/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week New York City’s public schools will close their doors and students will once again undertake online instruction.
The shutdown was triggered when 3 percent of coronavirus tests in the city came back positive over seven days. There are questions, however, around this number being used as a trigger — some health officials maintain that schools are safe.

Hylton had been drawn to his cousin’s strength and violence. He was pulled in by the archetype that he embodied and was envious of the power he seemed to command.
Wil describes his relative’s violence as “ambient” and “endemic,” but he was sure it wouldn’t turn on him. Until a few years ago, when his cousin tried to kill him.
“My attraction to my cousin and my detachment as a husband both reside in the pantheon of male tropes,” he wrote.</description></item><item><title>When the Pandemic Came to Rural Wisconsin | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210909/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 07:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210909/</guid><description>Podcast Description When the pandemic struck, Patty Schachtner, in her capacity as both a member of the Wisconsin State Senate and chief medical officer for St. Croix County, tried to remain one step ahead.

European leaders pushed largely similar messages, asking citizens to take measures to protect one another again, and governments offered broad financial support.
Weeks later, the effort seems to be working and infection rates are slowing.
In several parts of the United States, it’s a different story.

But after the election of Joe Biden, the party’s disappointing showing in congressional races — losing seats in the House and facing a struggle for even narrow control of the Senate — has exposed the rifts between progressives and moderates.
In interviews with The New York Times, House members on each side of that divide — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania — shared their views about how the Democrats can win back support in local races.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: 'Hard Times' | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210914/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210914/</guid><description>Podcast Description For the folk duo Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, pandemic isolation brought about a creative boon.

The sound of victory was loud. It was banging pots, honking horns and popping corks as supporters of President-elect Joe Biden celebrated his win.
But loss, too, has a sound. In the days after the U.S. election result was announced, some of the 71 million-plus Americans who backed President Trump are grieving. Can the country overcome its differences?

Millions of votes, many in key battleground states, are yet to be counted.
Florida — which went for President Trump — is the only bellwether to have confirmed its result. Other crucial states, including Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, are yet to be called.

At the heart of one race for the Wisconsin State Assembly are some of the same political cracks splitting the U.S. as a whole. Some believe keeping businesses running is a priority during the coronavirus pandemic; others think keeping people safe and healthy should be given precedence.

Joe Biden’s lead in national polls suggests he has a number of paths to victory. If states like Florida or Georgia break for him early on, then the Trump campaign could be in for a long night.
The task for President Trump is to close those paths. If he can hold Florida and quickly add the likes of Arizona and North Carolina, then the signs could point to re-election.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: ‘Kamala Harris, Mass Incarceration and Me’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210928/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210928/</guid><description>Podcast Description At 16, Reginald Dwayne Betts was sent to prison for nine years after pleading guilty to a carjacking, to having a gun, and to an attempted robbery.

Older voters, who are mostly conservative, make up around 25 percent of the swing state’s electorate and turn out in astonishing numbers.
They are also disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and polling suggests that Joe Biden is making inroads with Republican-leaning older voters.
In Florida’s conservative retirement communities, however, the decision to switch from Mr. Trump can have consequences and many stay quiet for fear of reprisals.</description></item><item><title>The Field: The Specter of Political Violence | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210930/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2020 09:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210930/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
With an election in which uncertainty may abound, concerns are swirling around the possibility of political violence. Experts and officials — including those charged with the security of polling stations and ballot counting facilities — have been taking extra precautions.
Americans across the political spectrum appear to be preparing themselves for this possibility, too: Eight of the 10 biggest weeks for gun sales since the late 1990s took place since March this year.</description></item><item><title>A Partisan Future for Local News? | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210931/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 10:05:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210931/</guid><description>Podcast Description Local news in America has long been widely trusted, and widely seen as objective. But as traditional local papers struggle, there have been attempts across the political spectrum to create more partisan outlets.

The race between George W. Bush and Al Gore that year turned on the result in Florida, where the vote was incredibly close and mired in balloting issues. After initially conceding, Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, contested the count.

One demographic group has provided plenty of exceptions: white suburban women.
In the past four years, the group has turned away from the president in astonishing numbers.

The reviews were mixed and predictable. He heard it described as “porny” and “creepy,” as well as “rugged” and “extra gay.”
It was a comment on a group call, however, that gave him pause.

It awards all of a state’s electors to the candidate with the most votes, no matter how small the margin of victory. Critics say that means millions of votes are effectively ignored.
The fairness of the Electoral College was seriously questioned in the 1960s. Amid the civil rights push, changes to the system were framed as the last step of democratization.</description></item><item><title>A Misinformation Test for Social Media | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210937/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 09:55:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210937/</guid><description>Podcast Description Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have invested a significant amount of time and money trying to avoid the mistakes made during the 2016 election.
A test of those new policies came last week, when The New York Post published a story that contained supposedly incriminating documents and pictures taken from the laptop of Hunter Biden. The provenance and authenticity of that information is still in question, and Joe Biden’s campaign has rejected the assertions.</description></item><item><title>A Pivotal Senate Race in North Carolina | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210938/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 09:54:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210938/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the struggle to control the U.S. Senate, one race in North Carolina — where the Republican incumbent, Thom Tillis, is trying to hold off his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham — could be crucial.
North Carolina is a classic purple state with a split political mind: progressive in some quarters, while firmly steeped in Southern conservative tradition in others.
Two bombshells have recently upended the race: Mr. Tillis fell ill with the coronavirus after attending an event for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination without a mask.</description></item><item><title>The Field: A Divided Latino Vote in Arizona | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210939/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:51:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210939/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language. In the last decade, elections have tightened in Arizona, a traditionally Republican stronghold, as Democrats gain ground.
According to polls, Joe Biden is leading in the state — partly because of white suburban women moving away from President Trump, but also because of efforts to activate the Latino vote.
Will that turn states like Arizona blue?

He was 63.
Throughout his nearly 40-year career, Jim was drawn to stories about discrimination, wrongly convicted prisoners and society’s mistreated outcasts. From 2007, he wrote The Times’s “About New York” column — when asked whether he had the best job in journalism, he responded, “I believe I do.”

Biden Jr.’s agenda and how he plans to govern a nation wracked by a public health and economic crisis.
The themes of Mr. Biden’s Democratic primary campaign were broad as he eschewed the policy-intensive approach of opponents like Senator Elizabeth Warren.

On some of the big issues, Mr. Trump has been the president he told us he was going to be, keeping commitments on deregulation, taxes, military spending and the judiciary.</description></item><item><title>The Confirmation Hearing of Amy Coney Barrett | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210943/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 09:55:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210943/</guid><description>Podcast Description It was a 12-hour session. Twenty-two senators took turns questioning Judge Amy Coney Barrett on her record and beliefs.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, evoked personal experience of life before Roe v. Wade and asked Judge Barrett whether she would vote to overturn abortion rights.
On that question, Judge Barrett demurred — an approach she would take to other contentious issues, including whether she would recuse herself if a presidential election dispute came before the court.</description></item><item><title>The Politics of Pandemic Relief | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210944/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 09:54:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210944/</guid><description>Podcast Description In March, Congress pushed through a relief package that preserved the U.S. economy during the pandemic. It felt like government functioning at its best.
But now, that money is running out and bipartisanship has given way to an ideological stalemate.

How did that happen? According to Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, abortion rights advocates have for too long taken Roe v.

Over the summer, Dave Mitchko started a makeshift pro-Trump sign operation from his garage. By his estimate he has handed out around 26,000 signs, put together with the help of his family.
Mr. Mitchko might seem like the kind of voter Joseph R. Biden Jr. wants to peel away from the Republicans in November.

Proving their suitability for the top job is secondary.
But this year is different. The president is 74 and spent much of the past week in the hospital, and his Democratic rival is 77. So it was vital for their running mates, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, to show in Wednesday night’s debate that they would be capable of stepping up if necessary.</description></item><item><title>Where Is This Pandemic Headed? | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210949/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 09:54:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210949/</guid><description>Podcast Description The pandemic has killed more than one million people around the world, at least 210,000 in the United States alone.

But instead of allaying concern, it raised questions, casting doubt on the timeline of the president’s illness and the seriousness of his condition.
We speak to Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker, White House correspondents for The Times, about the efforts to control the narrative, and pick through what is known about the president’s condition a month before the election.</description></item><item><title>One Million Lives | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210952/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 14:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210952/</guid><description>Podcast Description They came from Tel Aviv, Aleppo and a “small house by the river.” They were artists, whiskey drinkers and mbira players.

He would tell them about Florida’s Amendment Four, a ballot initiative that extended the franchise to those who had, in the past, been convicted on felony charges — it added an estimated 1.5 million people to the electorate, the nation’s largest voting expansion in four decades.</description></item><item><title>A User’s Guide to Mail-In Voting | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210955/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 09:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210955/</guid><description>Podcast Description The pandemic will mean that many more Americans vote by mail this year.
All 50 states require people to register before they can cast a mail-in vote. But from there, the rules diverge wildly.
And a lot could still change. Our correspondent Luke Broadwater, a reporter in Washington, says there are more than 300 challenges to voting-related rules winding through courts across the country.
Americans should probably brace for a different kind of election night — it could be days or longer before the full picture of results emerges.</description></item><item><title>Chaos and Contempt: The First Presidential Debate | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210956/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 09:58:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210956/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
Both presidential candidates had clear goals for their first debate on Tuesday.
For Joseph R. Biden Jr., the contest was an opportunity to consolidate his lead in polls before Election Day. President Trump’s task was, politically, a taller order — to change the course of a race that he seems to be losing. His tactics for doing that emerged quickly: interrupt and destabilize.</description></item><item><title>The President’s Taxes | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210957/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 09:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210957/</guid><description>Podcast Description Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig, investigative reporters for The Times, have pored over two decades and thousands of pages of documents on Donald J. Trump’s tax information, up to and including his time in the White House.
What they found was an existential threat to the image he has constructed about his wealth and lifestyle. The tax documents consistently appeared to call into question the business acumen he has cited in his presidential campaign and throughout his public life.</description></item><item><title>The Past, Present and Future of Amy Coney Barrett | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210958/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 09:54:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210958/</guid><description>Podcast Description Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s pick to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court, is a product of the conservative legal movement of the 1980s. She clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant of conservative jurisprudence, and his influence is evident throughout her judicial career.
Opponents of abortion, in particular, are hoping that her accession to the Supreme Court would be a crucial step forward for their movement.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: 'How Climate Migration Will Reshape America' | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210959/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210959/</guid><description>Podcast Description In August, Abrahm Lustgarten, who reports on climate, watched fires burn just 12 miles from his home in Marin County, Calif.
For two years, he had been studying the impact of the changing climate on global migration and recently turned some of his attention to the domestic situation.
Suddenly, with fires raging so close to home, he had to ask himself the question he had been asking other people: Was it time to move?</description></item><item><title>The Field: Policing and Power in Minneapolis | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210960/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 09:54:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210960/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language. In June, weeks after George Floyd was killed by the police, a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council expressed support for dismantling the city’s police department.
The councilors’ pledges to “abolish,” “dismantle” and “end policing as we know it” changed the local and national conversation about the police.
President Trump has wielded this decision and law-and-order arguments in his campaigning — Midwestern states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota may be decisive in the general election.</description></item><item><title>On the Ground in Louisville | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210961/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 10:11:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210961/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
Breonna Taylor’s mother and her supporters had made their feelings clear: Nothing short of murder charges for all three officers involved in Ms. Taylor’s death would amount to justice.
On Wednesday, one of the officers was indicted on a charge of “wanton endangerment.” No charges were brought against the two officers whose bullets actually struck Ms. Taylor.
In response, protesters have again taken to the streets to demand justice for the 26-year-old who was killed in her apartment in March.</description></item><item><title>A Historic Opening for Anti-Abortion Activists | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210962/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 09:56:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210962/</guid><description>Podcast Description President Trump appears to be on course to give conservatives a sixth vote on the Supreme Court, after several Republican senators who were previously on the fence said they would support quickly installing a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
In our interview today with Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B.

The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the ensuing battle to fill her seat is set to dominate American politics in the lead up to the election. A poll conducted for The New York Times before Justice Ginsburg’s death found voters in the battleground states of Arizona, Maine and North Carolina placed greater trust in Joseph R.

She spent two years clerking for a federal district judge, who agreed to hire her only after persuasion, and was rejected for a role working with Justice Felix Frankfurter because she was a woman.
With her career apparently stuttering in the male-dominated legal world, she returned to Columbia University to work on a law project that required her to spend time in Sweden.</description></item><item><title>Part 2: The Battle Over Her Seat | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210965/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 09:53:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210965/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the second episode of a two-part special, we consider the ramifications of Justice Ginsburg’s death and the struggle over how, and when, to replace her on the bench.
The stakes are high: If President Trump is able to name another member of the Supreme Court, he would be the first president since Ronald Reagan to appoint three justices, tipping the institution in a much more conservative direction.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: 'The Agency' | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210966/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210966/</guid><description>Podcast Description According to Ludmila Savchuk, a former employee, every day at the Internet Research Agency was essentially the same.
From an office complex in the Primorsky District of St. Petersburg, employees logged on to the internet via a proxy service and set about flooding Russia’s popular social networking sites with opinions handed to them by their bosses.
The shadowy organization, which according to one employee filled 40 rooms, industrialized the art of “trolling.</description></item><item><title>Special Episode: ‘An Obituary for the Land’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210967/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 19:26:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210967/</guid><description>Podcast Description “Nothing comes easily out here,” Terry Tempest Williams, a Utah-based writer, said of the American West. Her family was once almost taken by fire, and as a child of the West, she grew up with it.
Our producer Bianca Giaever, who was working out of the West Coast when the wildfires started, woke up one day amid the smoke with the phrase “an obituary to the land” in her head.</description></item><item><title>A Messy Return to School in New York | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210968/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 09:55:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210968/</guid><description>Podcast Description Iolani Grullon teaches dual-language kindergarten in Washington Heights in New York City, where she has worked for the last 15 years.
She, like many colleagues, is leery about a return to in-person instruction amid reports of positive coronavirus cases in other schools. “I go through waves of anxiety and to being hopeful that it works out to just being worried,” she told our editor Lisa Chow.
On top of mixed messaging from the city about the form teaching could take, her anxiety is compounded by a concern that she might bring the coronavirus home to her daughter, whose immune system is weaker as a result of an organ transplant.</description></item><item><title>The Forgotten Refugee Crisis in Europe | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210969/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 09:57:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210969/</guid><description>Podcast Description Among the olive groves of Moria, on the Greek island of Lesbos, a makeshift city of tents and containers housed thousands of asylum seekers who had fled conflict and hardship in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.
Already frustrated at the deplorable conditions, inhabitants’ anger was compounded by coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The situation reached a breaking point this month when fires were set, probably by a small group of irate asylum seekers, according to the authorities.</description></item><item><title>Quarantine on a College Campus | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210970/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:55:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210970/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
Infected with the coronavirus and separated from their peers in special dorms, some college students have taken to sharing their quarantine experiences on TikTok.
In some videos posted to the social media app, food is a source of discontent; one student filmed a disappointing breakfast — warm grape juice, an unripe orange, a “mystery” vegan muffin and an oat bar. Others broach more profound issues like missed deliveries of food and supplie.</description></item><item><title>A Deadly Tinderbox | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210971/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 09:54:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210971/</guid><description>Podcast Description “The entire state is burning.” That was the refrain Jack Healy, our national correspondent, kept hearing when he arrived in the fire zone in Oregon.
The scale of the wildfires is dizzying — millions of acres have burned, 30 different blazes are raging and thousands of people have been displaced.
Dry conditions, exacerbated by climate change and combined with a windstorm, created the deadly tinderbox.
The disaster has proved a fertile ground for misinformation: Widely discredited rumors spread on social media claiming that antifa activists were setting fires and looting.</description></item><item><title>Inside Trump’s Immigration Crackdown | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210972/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 09:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210972/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
After Donald Trump was elected president, two filmmakers were granted rare access to the operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since Mr. Trump had campaigned on a hard-line immigration agenda, the leaders of the usually secretive agency jumped at a chance to have their story told from the inside. Today, we speak to the filmmakers about what they saw during nearly three years at ICE and how the Trump administration reacted to a cut of the film.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: 'The Children in the Shadows' | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210973/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210973/</guid><description>Podcast Description Prince is 9 years old, ebullient and bright; he has spent much of the pandemic navigating the Google Classroom app from his mother’s phone.
The uncertainty and isolation of the coronavirus lockdown is not new to him — he is one of New York City’s more than 100,000 homeless schoolchildren, the largest demographic within the homeless population.
Families like Prince’s are largely invisible.
Samantha M.

The state’s current wildfires have seen two and a half million acres already burned.
Climate change has made conditions ripe for fires: Temperatures are higher and the landscape drier. But the destruction has also become more acute because of the number of homes that are built on the wildland-urban interface — where development meets wild vegetation.</description></item><item><title>The Killing of Breonna Taylor, Part 2 | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210975/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:55:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210975/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language. “So there’s just shooting, like we’re both on the ground,” Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend, said of the raid on her home. “I don’t know where these shots are coming from, and I’m scared.”
Much of what happened on the night the police killed Ms. Taylor is unclear.
As part of an investigation for The New York Times, our correspondent Rukmini Callimachi and the filmmaker Yoruba Richen spoke to neighbors and trawled through legal documents, police records and call logs to understand what happened that night and why.</description></item><item><title>The Killing of Breonna Taylor, Part 1 | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210976/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 09:56:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210976/</guid><description>Podcast Description At the beginning of 2020, Breonna Taylor posted on social media that it was going to be her year. She was planning a family with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker; she had a new job and a new car. She had also blocked Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer with whom she had been romantically involved on and off since 2016, from her phone.

In March, Daniel Prude was exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis. His brother called an ambulance in the hopes that Mr. Prude would be hospitalized, but he was sent back home after three hours without a diagnosis.
Later, when Mr. Prude ran out of the house barely clothed into the Rochester night, his brother, Joe Prude, again called on the authorities for help, but this time it was to the police.</description></item><item><title>Bringing the Theater Back to Life | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210978/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 10:06:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210978/</guid><description>Podcast Description Three months into Broadway’s shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, Michael Paulson, a theater reporter for The New York Times, got a call from a theater in western Massachusetts — they planned to put on “Godspell,” a well-loved and much-performed musical from 1971, in the summer.

Jimmy Lai was born in mainland China but made his fortune in Hong Kong, starting as a sweatshop worker and becoming a clothing tycoon. After the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, he turned his attention to the media, launching publications critical of China’s Communist Party.
“I believe in the media,” he told Austin Ramzy, a Hong Kong reporter for The New York Times. “By delivering information, you’re actually delivering freedom.</description></item><item><title>A High-Stakes Standoff in Belarus | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210980/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:55:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210980/</guid><description>Podcast Description Aleksandr Lukashenko came to office in Belarus in the 1990s on a nostalgic message, promising to undo moves toward a market economy and end the hardship the country had endured after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. As president, he acquired dictatorial powers, removing term limits, cracking down on opposition and stifling the press.
In recent years, however, economic stagnation has bred growing discontent. And when Mr. Lukashenko claimed an implausible landslide victory in a presidential election last month, he found himself facing mass protests that have only grown as he has attempted to crush them.</description></item><item><title>Joe Biden’s Rebuttal | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210981/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 09:54:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210981/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s plan for winning the presidential election relies on putting together African-American voters of all ages, including younger Black people who are less enthusiastic about him, and white moderates who find President Trump unacceptable.
At last week’s Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign appeared to be sowing discord within that coalition. By framing the response to unrest in cities as binary — you are either for violence or for the police — Republicans seemed to be daring Mr.</description></item><item><title>‘Who Replaces Me?’ | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210982/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210982/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
As a police officer in his hometown of Flint, Mich., Scott Watson has worked to become a pillar of the community, believing his identity has placed him in a unique position to do his job. He has given out his cellphone number, driven students to prom and provided food and money to those who were hungry.
After watching the video of the killing of George Floyd, his identity as a Black police officer became a source of self-consciousness instead of pride.</description></item><item><title>The Sunday Read: 'In the Line of Fire' | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210983/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210983/</guid><description>Podcast Description Many American states use the labor of inmates to help fight its fires, but none so more than California. Using incarcerated firefighters saves the state’s taxpayers an estimated $100 million a year.
The women that choose to enter the firefighting camps are afforded better pay, by prison standards, and an improved quality of time served. However, the money they earn from putting their lives on the line is dwarfed by the salaries of the civilian firefighters they work alongside — one woman reports to earn $500 a year, compared with the $40,000 starting salary on the outside.</description></item><item><title>Donald Trump Jr.’s Journey to Republican Stardom | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210984/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 09:54:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210984/</guid><description>Podcast Description For much of his life, Donald Trump Jr. has been disregarded by his father.

The shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black father from Kenosha, Wis., by a white police officer has reverberated through the city, fueling protests and unrest.

The 2020 election is also taking place against a backdrop of mass protests and unrest over racial justice. And speaker after speaker at the Republican National Convention has used the themes and language of 1968 to play on the perceived fears of suburban voters — cities on fire, the need to restore law and order.</description></item><item><title>Where We Stand on the Pandemic | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210987/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:54:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210987/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the U.S., emergency-use authorization has been granted for convalescent plasma, the efficacy of which is yet to be robustly tested. For some, this echoes the situation with hydroxychloroquine and the government’s subsequent U-turn on its rollout.
Meanwhile, America’s infection rate appears to be flattening out — but at tens of thousands of cases per day.

By the end of July, there had been more shootings in 2020 than in all of 2019. Shootings have risen in other metropolises, too, including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Houston.

It seemed impossible to impose social distancing in basketball, an indoor sport with players almost constantly jostling one another for more than two hours. However, there was a big financial incentive to keep games going: ending the 2019 season early would have cost the league an estimated $1 billion in television revenue.
The solution?</description></item><item><title>Joe Biden’s 30-Year Quest | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210991/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 09:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210991/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joseph R. Biden Jr. first ran for president in 1988, when his campaign was cut short after he made a series of blunders. After six terms in the Senate, he tried again in 2008 but failed to gain any traction in a contest won by Barack Obama. In the current political landscape, however, his focus on personal integrity and experience, which were also centerpieces of his previous campaigns, has proved much more compelling.</description></item><item><title>The President, the Postal Service and the Election | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210992/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 09:53:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210992/</guid><description>Podcast Description The installation of Louis DeJoy as postmaster general has caused alarm. Since taking up the role in June, he has enacted a number of cuts to the Postal Service: ending overtime for workers, limiting how many runs they can make in a day, reassigning more than 20 executives and, from the perspective of the unions, speeding up the removal of mail-sorting machines.
The actions of Mr. DeJoy, a Republican megadonor and Trump ally, have been interpreted by many Democrats as an attempt to sabotage the election in concert with President Trump, who has himself admitted to wanting to limit funding that could help mail-in voting.</description></item><item><title>A Dinner and a Deal | The Daily</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1196210993/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 09:56:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210993/</guid><description>Podcast Description In March 2018, Mark Landler — then a White House correspondent at The New York Times — attended a dinner party hosted by the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador, Yousef al-Otaiba, at a Washington restaurant.

Things are going according to the most aggressive schedule.
However, accelerating the development process has increased the likelihood of cronyism and undue political influence.
