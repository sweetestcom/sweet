        <description>Podcast Description As we age, our bodies undergo numerous changes, including a decline in muscle mass and cognitive function. For many of us, exercise and diet play crucial roles in maintaining our health and well-being.&amp;nbsp;
But how can the protein we eat affect our abilities to exercise and stay healthy as we age?
It can be difficult to separate fact from fiction when it comes to the effects of protein. How much do we need?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We’ve probably all been reprimanded for eating too fast at the dinner table or suffered the dreaded “itis” from eating way too much food at a family gathering. Our society and the systems we’ve developed to feed it have ballooned to such a point that they easily override our natural bodily systems that tell us when we’ve had enough to eat.&amp;nbsp;
When nearly&amp;nbsp;50% of the United States population&amp;nbsp;is projected to have obesity by 2030, can something as simple as changing the speed with which we eat really be an effective tool for weight loss and sustaining a healthy body?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Menopause is a time of significant hormonal changes which can lead to a range of symptoms that can severely impact quality of life for many women. So, a drug that promises to reduce these symptoms is incredibly welcome, but it has been steeped in controversy.
HRT (Hormone replacement therapy) has been widely debated, with conflicting information about its effectiveness, with some suggesting HRT is outright dangerous. In fact, a massive study twenty years ago linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ultra-processed foods have become ubiquitous in modern diets. Many of us eat them regularly without understanding their potential impacts on our health.&amp;nbsp;

There is no shortage of variety when it comes to the mighty (yet humble) nut and the ways we consume them. Dried, chopped, made into butter or roasted (over an open fire, anyone?) these little guys provide the nutrients our brains and bodies need in surprisingly high quantities.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Proteins, carbs, and fats …&amp;nbsp; most people understand what the last two are. Carbs are sugars, and fat is, well, fat. It&#39;s protein that’s so important to our diets, but so often misunderstood —&amp;nbsp;by the general public, that is.
Since the 1950s and 1960s, scientists have been measuring how protein affects our performance, how it supports and maintains the body’s structure, and how best to incorporate it into our diets.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you were to ask Siri, Alexa, or ChatGPT for medical advice right now, that would be a terrible idea.&amp;nbsp;

But is any of this safe? Should we really trust machines with our health? And will any of this actually happen?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The formal definition for constipation is ‘Having fewer than three bowel movements per week’. But, did you know that you can have a bowel movement every day and still be constipated? Recent data has shown that a quarter of people worldwide have at one point reported symptoms, suggesting that there is so much more to constipation than simply infrequent bowel movements.
In today’s short-ish episode of ZOE Science &amp;amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will attempt to dispel some misconceptions about constipation and empower you to have better bowel movements.</description>

So, having a healthy gut is extremely important – but there’s still a lot we don’t know. Gut biome tests are a new, exciting technology, but are they the be-all and end-all for dietary decision-making?

Spikes cause inflammation, accelerate aging, and lead to type 2 diabetes. Crashes make us feel moody and tired, and crave foods we don’t need.&amp;nbsp;
We can control our blood sugar through what and how we eat. But something else affects our blood sugar — physical activity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The acid in your stomach is so powerful it can dissolve metal. Luckily, your stomach is fine-tuned to deal with its acidic fluid, but the rest of your body isn’t quite as hardy. So, if acid escapes from your stomach and reaches your esophagus, it can cause a painful sensation in the chest —&amp;nbsp;this is heartburn.

All without the scientific evidence to support their claims.&amp;nbsp;
So do we need vitamins to lead a healthy life? Or could these supplements actually cause serious health complications?

There are myriad options —&amp;nbsp;from the 5:2 diet, with two days of extreme calorie restriction each week, to the warrior diet, which involves eating only raw fruit during the day and a mammoth feast at night. Whatever the approach, intermittent fasting involves restricting the window of time when you eat.

If these tubes fail, the result can be fatal. In some cases, it’s a heart attack. In others, it’s a stroke, where the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, and brain cells are damaged or killed.&amp;nbsp;

        <description>Podcast Description Our planet is overheating. Human society is creating too much carbon dioxide, stopping the sun’s warmth from escaping back into space. As earth gets hotter, its ice caps are melting, causing sea levels to rise, and submerging entire communities. Floods, droughts, and wildfires are already becoming much more common.
Some effects of climate change are now irreversible, but there is still hope, and adjusting what we eat might play a bigger part than you’d imagine.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Keto has been promoted as a magic bullet for weight loss by its supporters and slammed as dangerous by its opponents. It&#39;s no surprise - completely removing almost all carbohydrates is not what most people consider ‘a balanced diet’.
With carbs off the table, Keto diets involve a dramatically increased fat intake. At the same time, drastically reducing carbs means starving our gut microbes of the fiber that feeds them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The word ‘processed’ has become synonymous with being unhealthy. The mainstream media encourages us to detox from processed food or offers us ‘10 easy ways’ to stop eating it.&amp;nbsp;
But nearly everything we consume has undergone some type of processing.
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp;amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: If most of what we eat is processed, can it really be that unhealthy for us?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A mummified man found in the mountains of Italy on a nutrition science podcast? Have we gone completely off track?&amp;nbsp;
We haven’t - we promise.&amp;nbsp;
This unfortunate soul could be the key that unlocks an entirely new understanding of human health.&amp;nbsp;
This mummy, discovered in an alpine snow drift by two hikers, gives us a remarkable glimpse into the surprising dietary choices of our ancestors.
In today’s episode, Jonathan discovers some secrets held by our ancestors by speaking to two outstanding guests:</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From blueberries to salmon, kale to acai, it seems like anything and everything can be classed as a superfood these days.
Supposedly they can prevent cancer, reduce inflammation, and even help you live longer…
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science and Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah look at the history of superfoods and ask: are some foods really more ‘super’ than others? Or is this just another marketing ploy?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s a biological process that we need to stay alive. Yet too much of it leads to disease and a shorter life.&amp;nbsp;
Inflammation is the immune system’s response to an outside event it thinks is dangerous. This stimulus could be an injury, like falling off your bike or an infection by a virus or bacteria. But inflammation can also be triggered by our food in the hours after we eat.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s no exaggeration to say that bread shaped modern humanity - it was the cultivation of wheat for flour that transformed our ancestors from hunter-gatherers to city dwellers.&amp;nbsp;
Today, millions of us start the day with a slice of toast, and most lunches in the US and UK are wrapped in a slice of bread or a burger bun as a cheap, flexible, and delicious energy source.
But modern industrial processes designed to reduce the time and cost of baking mean today’s bread would be unrecognizable to our ancestors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Coffee’s earliest consumption dates back millennia when the tribesmen of Ethiopia used its ground-up berries to help aid concentration during prayer.&amp;nbsp;
Arriving in Europe in the 17th century, Coffee quickly began to replace beer and wine as a favourite breakfast drink.&amp;nbsp;
In the 20th century, coffee was blamed for high blood pressure and heart attacks, and more recently linked to a rising epidemic of poor sleep.&amp;nbsp;
None of this has prevented coffee’s relentless rise.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You may have heard there are bugs in your gut. But do they matter?&amp;nbsp;
Today, the evidence shows the answer is a resounding yes. This ecosystem of tiny microbes living in our bodies is one of the most exciting areas in medical research, linked to everything from metabolic to mental health.
So while many of us have heard that gut health is essential, few of us understand why and what we should do to support our gut bacteria.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today we’re talking about fat, a delicious component of our food with a terrible reputation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Fats have been broadly associated with weight gain and heart disease until recently.
A mountain of new scientific evidence suggests this is wrong and that it&#39;s not as simple as ‘all fat is bad’. Indeed, eating more healthy fat might actually reduce heart disease for many people.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Dr Sarah Berry to learn about what science tells us today, whether it is possible to lose weight on a high-fat diet, what oils we should be cooking with, and the different types of fats.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Our transformation into coach potatoes happened in the blink of an eye. Only 100 years ago, most people relied on manual work to make their living.&amp;nbsp;
Today, things are different. Many of us live our lives in front of a screen. Online shopping and remote work mean some of us don’t need to leave the house at all. So how bad is this for us?&amp;nbsp;
The answer is now clear: Low levels of physical activity lead to an increased risk of disease and a lower quality of life in older age.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There&#39;s a condition that leads to an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, and early death that&#39;s been affecting people for as long as they&#39;ve existed. The many symptoms can severely impact quality of life - ranging from headaches and memory problems to anxiety and weight gain.&amp;nbsp;
This condition affects more than half of the world&#39;s population, but unbelievably its rarely discussed and the scientific research that exists on it is limited.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For many of us, it&#39;s a ritual to help us wind down after a long day, an excuse to catch up with friends, or a lubricant to an awkward social situation. Alcohol can be delicious, but our relationship with it is often complicated.&amp;nbsp;
Good times with friends aren’t without sacrifice, and many of us feel the morning after impact of a few too many drinks. For an unfortunate minority, alcohol can lead to addiction and even death.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This plant has been used by human beings for thousands of years with samples found in 5000-year-old pottery discovered in the upper Amazon. The Mayans considered it a gift from the gods and used it in their sacred ceremonies, where it was believed to have mystical healing powers. For the Aztecs, it was worth more than gold and given to their victorious warriors.&amp;nbsp;
We are talking, of course, about chocolate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description 1 in 5 people suffer from food intolerances, a figure that’s growing each year. As a result, people are eating increasingly restricted diets, removing dairy, gluten and many other foods from their plates. Unfortunately, they end up eating highly processed foods that damage their gut microbiome and lead to long-term health problems. Even with food restrictions, many people see limited improvements in their symptoms.
The whole topic of intolerance is full of pseudoscience, dubious blood tests, and miracle cures.</description>
