Today we&amp;rsquo;ll cover when your idea is ready to start, how to structure the first couple of weeks, and how to think about the giant boulder sitting in front of you.</description></item><item><title>The Quest for an Identity | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220003/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220003/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we&amp;rsquo;ll help you find an identity. An identity is something unique that you can organize your business beneath. A north star that can act as a lens for every decision you make. We talk through how to use category shifts and first principles to find and evaluate possible identities, and when to stick with an identity vs. when to jump ship. We use a bunch of examples - from an Italian restaurant to a skincare company called Jolie to the 1994 Arkansas Razorbacks basketball team.</description></item><item><title>How to Find a Differentiator (ITS Classic) | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220004/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220004/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we&amp;rsquo;ll outline two frameworks that&amp;rsquo;ll help you find a meaningful differentiator.

The short answer is they speak the wrong language. Customers speak Problem, entrepreneurs speak Solution. It&amp;rsquo;s like two people trying to have a conversation when one only speaks Latin and the other only speaks Dutch.
We go through how to start speaking Problem, and show the power of Problem Language through a live idea test - two landing pages for an AI bot to help people get out of debt: one with Solution Language, one with Problem Language.</description></item><item><title>An SOP for Testing a Startup Idea | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220006/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220006/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you build an SOP for testing startup ideas. We&amp;rsquo;ll use an example from a listener - a startup in the homeschooling space - as a guinea pig.

Pros build businesses that have a shot - amateurs never leave the starting gate. Unfortunately, most amateurs don&amp;rsquo;t know they&amp;rsquo;re approaching their idea the wrong way.
We talk through your vision and your internal system - the internal process you&amp;rsquo;ll build, automate, and scale to help you execute that vision. We do it with a little help from the best run solo business I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered (an interior designer), and the best tool for your internal system (Zapier).</description></item><item><title>Writing Persuasive Copy to Test an Idea | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220008/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220008/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, we talk through how to write compelling copy.

The only way to get asymmetric results in life is to spend a lot of time in what we call the &amp;ldquo;chaos&amp;rdquo; zone - the uncomfortable place where you&amp;rsquo;re finding things no one else has yet. This type of work (life) is uncomfortable and stressful, so people don&amp;rsquo;t do it. But, it&amp;rsquo;s where all the potential asymmetric value is. So, we go through tactics to make this stage feel safer, allowing you to spend more time in it and increasing the chances you pull a life changing business out of it.</description></item><item><title>The Three Types of Problems Worth Your Time to Solve | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220010/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220010/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we talk through the three types of problems that deserve a solution.

Every decision you make needs to nest neatly below this core decision for your business to work, but tons of founders are either trying to do both simultaneously or think they&amp;rsquo;re one when they&amp;rsquo;re really the other.
We clarify the difference between freelancer and entrepreneur, help you decide which will make you happier, and get you started on the path for whichever you choose.</description></item><item><title>A System to Relish the Uncomfortable Stuff | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220013/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220013/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, we help you become the type of founder who relishes uncomfortable things that lead to successful startups.

But so much of our idea evaluation ignores the most fundamental building block of a startup - the magic moment that will spur organic growth.

It&amp;rsquo;s a thoughtful, purposeful, highly effective business that creates and curates beautifully designed products. Jeff has run and grown the business slowly and sustainably (without funding), building an incredibly engaged customer base. This strong customer affinity allows him to launch products through crowdfunding campaigns without a massive marketing budget.
We talk through how he built Ugmonk, how he thinks about curation and design, and we go deep on his most recent Kickstarter campaign - a ~half million dollar raise for Analog.</description></item><item><title>How to Not Waste Your Life | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220122/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 12:32:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220122/</guid><description>Podcast Description The past 15 months kicked our butts.

This episode goes through three questions that&amp;rsquo;ll help you refocus, tactics to find your North Star, and a framework to reset your inputs.

Everyone is on a path driven by inertia, which leads just about everyone to always repeat the same things. Which is a problem if you&amp;rsquo;re starting a startup, since you need people to do something different (buy your thing).
In this episode we talk through inertia and how to build startups that leverage it vs. fight it, with cameos from Javier the Hot Air Balloon Guy, Erin Andrews, and Donald Trump.</description></item><item><title>INTERVIEW: Tom Eisenmann (HBS) on Why Startups Fail | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220124/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220124/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we&amp;rsquo;ve got Tom Eisenmann on the pod.

He responded quickly - storytelling. The amount of compelling copy a startup needs to write in 2021 is astounding - from ads to emails to socials to pitch decks - and the base rate has gotten extremely high. A startup can only be as successful as it&amp;rsquo;s messaging, and that all starts with a founder&amp;rsquo;s ability to tell the story of their customer and their product.</description></item><item><title>How to Prioritize and Build a Personal Operating System (ITS classic) | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220128/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220128/</guid><description>Podcast Description We revisit an episode from the early days of the podcast on an operating system for founders. Not everything I say here has stuck, and not everything I do I recommend. But the bones of this podcast are rock solid. Being thoughtful about how you work and what you work on is the key for building a startup in the margins. And, everyone has more margins now. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the people who isn&amp;rsquo;t going to have to commute again, this is your chance.</description></item><item><title>How to lose 1.8 billion dollars in 10 days | Idea to Startup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7120220129/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220129/</guid><description>Podcast Description Predicting a startup will fail is like betting every number on the roulette wheel except that green double zero and then puffing out your chest when one of your numbers hits. It&amp;rsquo;s just not impressive to predict that something going up against overwhelming odds won&amp;rsquo;t beat those odds.
And yet&amp;hellip;. Sometimes people build startups like horses asses. And in that case, they need to be called out.

But we&amp;rsquo;re also told we need to be experts for our startups to work. How do you balance being curious and learning with being seen as an expert?
Today, we explore curiosity through one of the best founders to ever go through Tacklebox, and through another founder just getting started building something in the Space&amp;hellip;space.

It&amp;rsquo;s easy for entrepreneurs to spend their time putting out fires - they&amp;rsquo;re often the only ones who will. But it&amp;rsquo;s far more important to block off time to identify and pursue opportunities that&amp;rsquo;ll create asymmetric value.
We discuss a framework for identifying, prioritizing, and pursuing opportunities. Also, Steph Curry and how to say &amp;ldquo;razorblades&amp;rdquo; with a flawless Australian accent.
