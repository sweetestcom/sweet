        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220003/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Today we&amp;rsquo;ll help you find an identity. An identity is something unique that you can organize your business beneath. A north star that can act as a lens for every decision you make. We talk through how to use category shifts and first principles to find and evaluate possible identities, and when to stick with an identity vs. when to jump ship. We use a bunch of examples - from an Italian restaurant to a skincare company called Jolie to the 1994 Arkansas Razorbacks basketball team.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about why so many entrepreneurs can&amp;rsquo;t effectively explain what they&amp;rsquo;re doing to their customers. The short answer is they speak the wrong language. Customers speak Problem, entrepreneurs speak Solution. It&amp;rsquo;s like two people trying to have a conversation when one only speaks Latin and the other only speaks Dutch.
We go through how to start speaking Problem, and show the power of Problem Language through a live idea test - two landing pages for an AI bot to help people get out of debt: one with Solution Language, one with Problem Language.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you build an SOP for testing startup ideas. We&amp;rsquo;ll use an example from a listener - a startup in the homeschooling space - as a guinea pig. The best way to have a great startup idea this time next year is to test out a bunch of ideas in the interim. This SOP will help you do it, and scale the process.

        <description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about pros and amateurs. Pros build businesses that have a shot - amateurs never leave the starting gate. Unfortunately, most amateurs don&amp;rsquo;t know they&amp;rsquo;re approaching their idea the wrong way.
We talk through your vision and your internal system - the internal process you&amp;rsquo;ll build, automate, and scale to help you execute that vision. We do it with a little help from the best run solo business I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered (an interior designer), and the best tool for your internal system (Zapier).</description>

        <title>How to Embrace Risk, Uncertainty, and Chaos | Idea to Startup</title>

        <description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you embrace risk, uncertainty, and chaos. The only way to get asymmetric results in life is to spend a lot of time in what we call the &amp;ldquo;chaos&amp;rdquo; zone - the uncomfortable place where you&amp;rsquo;re finding things no one else has yet. This type of work (life) is uncomfortable and stressful, so people don&amp;rsquo;t do it. But, it&amp;rsquo;s where all the potential asymmetric value is. So, we go through tactics to make this stage feel safer, allowing you to spend more time in it and increasing the chances you pull a life changing business out of it.</description>

The goal is to solve an immediate, painful problem that&amp;rsquo;ll build trust and allow you to pitch your bigger, North Star vision. Wedges get you started, and life is 100x harder without them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you think through a deceptively tough question - are you a freelancer or an entrepreneur? Every decision you make needs to nest neatly below this core decision for your business to work, but tons of founders are either trying to do both simultaneously or think they&amp;rsquo;re one when they&amp;rsquo;re really the other.
We clarify the difference between freelancer and entrepreneur, help you decide which will make you happier, and get you started on the path for whichever you choose.</description>

Today we help you build that system, using The Costanza Swap, The Three Levers of Resilience, and The Failure Case.

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to objectively evaluate your idea early on - this framework helps you rise above your idea to do it effectively. A side-effect is that the framework will help you find and pursue the good ideas.
We talk through 1) Finding and Evaluating the Real Risk, 2) Predicting Organic Growth Potential, and 3) Predicting the Likelihood of Converting Early Customers, using a startup idea from a listener as an example.</description>

We talk through a cold email that&amp;rsquo;ll get you customers to speak with and a method to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re unbiased in what you hear.</description>

This pod lays out a decision framework to help with the quit or stick question.</description>

How would we motivate these people to take action? What can we test? The framework leads the way as we kickstart the business.

But so much of our idea evaluation ignores the most fundamental building block of a startup - the magic moment that will spur organic growth. There is no funding or team or business without that initial magic, so maybe the best route is to reverse engineer a business from that moment?</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220121/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Jeff Sheldon is the founder of Ugmonk, a company I have an enormous amount of admiration for. It&amp;rsquo;s a thoughtful, purposeful, highly effective business that creates and curates beautifully designed products. Jeff has run and grown the business slowly and sustainably (without funding), building an incredibly engaged customer base. This strong customer affinity allows him to launch products through crowdfunding campaigns without a massive marketing budget.
We talk through how he built Ugmonk, how he thinks about curation and design, and we go deep on his most recent Kickstarter campaign - a ~half million dollar raise for Analog.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/7120220123/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Inertia is the tendency to not change. Everyone is on a path driven by inertia, which leads just about everyone to always repeat the same things. Which is a problem if you&amp;rsquo;re starting a startup, since you need people to do something different (buy your thing).
In this episode we talk through inertia and how to build startups that leverage it vs. fight it, with cameos from Javier the Hot Air Balloon Guy, Erin Andrews, and Donald Trump.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I recently asked a good investor friend of mine what he thought the most underrated but important skill for entrepreneurs in 2021 was. He responded quickly - storytelling. The amount of compelling copy a startup needs to write in 2021 is astounding - from ads to emails to socials to pitch decks - and the base rate has gotten extremely high. A startup can only be as successful as it&amp;rsquo;s messaging, and that all starts with a founder&amp;rsquo;s ability to tell the story of their customer and their product.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We revisit an episode from the early days of the podcast on an operating system for founders. Not everything I say here has stuck, and not everything I do I recommend. But the bones of this podcast are rock solid. Being thoughtful about how you work and what you work on is the key for building a startup in the margins. And, everyone has more margins now. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the people who isn&amp;rsquo;t going to have to commute again, this is your chance.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Predicting a startup will fail is like betting every number on the roulette wheel except that green double zero and then puffing out your chest when one of your numbers hits. It&amp;rsquo;s just not impressive to predict that something going up against overwhelming odds won&amp;rsquo;t beat those odds.
And yet&amp;hellip;. Sometimes people build startups like horses asses. And in that case, they need to be called out.

It&amp;rsquo;s easy for entrepreneurs to spend their time putting out fires - they&amp;rsquo;re often the only ones who will. But it&amp;rsquo;s far more important to block off time to identify and pursue opportunities that&amp;rsquo;ll create asymmetric value.
We discuss a framework for identifying, prioritizing, and pursuing opportunities. Also, Steph Curry and how to say &amp;ldquo;razorblades&amp;rdquo; with a flawless Australian accent.
