        <description>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.
And I want to get started just with a question that is
really basic, but I think chips have been in the
ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a
semiconductor was a few years ago.
Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>

        <description>So you are the CEO of OpenAI, 37 years old.
Your company is the maker of ChatGPT,
which has taken the world by storm.
Why do you think it&amp;rsquo;s captured people&amp;rsquo;s imagination?
I think people really have fun with it
and they see the possibility
and they see the ways this can help them,
this can inspire them,
this can help people create,
help people learn,
help people do all of these different tasks.</description>

We are here today to talk about something that&amp;rsquo;s very
fundamental to the human experience,
the way we work.
Most specifically, the way we work with computers.
In fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve been on this continuous journey
towards human-computer symbiosis for several decades.

OpenAI has been building this technology really
since we started the company.
But for the past two years, we&amp;rsquo;ve
been really focused on delivering GPT-4.
That started with rebuilding our entire training stack,
actually training the model, and then
