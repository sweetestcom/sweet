        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Friends make life good. They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun. They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.
But maybe you have scrolled through your phone, unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.
What is a thing?
Why do things happen?
And why do they happen the way they do?
Let’s try to approach this step-by-step.
What are you made of?
You are matter which is made of molecules
which are made of atoms and those are made of elementary particles.
But if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,
what are they made of?</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.
But there is still one place to explore.
It&amp;rsquo;s a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.
The deep sea.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive down.

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes. Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable
planets.
If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1%
of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years.
Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so
in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Over 40 years ago, US President Richard Nixon
declared drug abuse public enemy number one,
starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.
Today, the numbers are in.
The War on Drugs is a huge failure, with devastating unintended consequences.
It led to mass incarceration in the US;
to corruption, political destabilization, and violence
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa;
to systemic human rights abuses across the world.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But… where is all of that? While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.
In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿So, have you ever wondered who actually invented the internet?
Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet.
But all they did was invent clever ways of using the internet.
So the person who “invented the internet” should be a gazillionaire
equivalent to, say, God, shoudn&amp;rsquo;t they?
Who should get the credit, then?
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?
Maybe.
Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Matter, as we know it;
Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and trees, rocks and us.
This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.
About 25% is dark matter; and 70% is dark energy.
Both of which are invisible.
This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is
really only a tiny fraction of reality.
But it gets worse.
We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are, or how they work.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Many of our viewers have asked us a very serious question:
What if we made a big pile of bombs
and exploded every nuclear weapon in the world all at once?
Strangely enough, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good source
to answer this question to our satisfaction.
So, we gathered together a few scientists to calculate what would happen.
And find an answer to this extremely important scientific problem,</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Light, is the connection between us and the universe.
Through light, we could experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.
But, what is light?
In a nutshell
Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size
That can&amp;rsquo;t be split, only created or destroyed.
Light also has a wave-particle duality
being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time (although this is a lie)</description>

Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa,
and also ancient alien ruins on Titan.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be great?
Well, no. It would be horrible news,
devastating even.
It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain
and that it might be coming soon.
Why?
Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime

In the process of trying to understand it,
to get better at killing it,
we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day:
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,
which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.
To understand why we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.</description>

over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.
In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more.
That&amp;rsquo;s 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.
And it&amp;rsquo;s not just CO₂,
we&amp;rsquo;re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.
There&amp;rsquo;s a visceral joy in blowing things up,
and a horrifying fascination with things like fireballs, shockwaves, and radiation.
And while it does help put our destructive power in perspective,
it&amp;rsquo;s not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t about silly stacks of TNT, or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.</description>

Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things!
Eating meat has become so trivial that many people
don&amp;rsquo;t consider something a proper meal if there&amp;rsquo;s no animal involved.
Which is pretty amazing,
since only a few decades ago meat was a luxury product.
Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.
Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the most inefficient way of feeding humans.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.
You probably don&amp;rsquo;t feel it, but there&amp;rsquo;s an incredible amount of activity
going on inside you,
and this activity can never stop.
Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards.
The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells.
The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards.
To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere.</description>

Physicist Erwin Schrödinger defined life this way:
Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium.
What does this mean?
Let’s pretend that your download folder is the universe.
It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.
By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.
This is what living things do.

consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.
But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles.
We all intuitively know what consciousness is.

It&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing here, right now.

Not bound by static formations but changing neighborhoods constantly. Fortunately space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us. Unfortunately, they don’t have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on earth.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question: What if the moon crashes into earth? It’s more interesting and weird than you probably think. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics: Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the Moon on its way to crash into us already?
We know that earth’s gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon, but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force. But there is no other force countering gravity - instead, the trick to staying up is a ‘sideways’ motion that we call an orbit.</description>

The Big Bang.
The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite.
Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe
as infinite and ageless.
Until Einstein’s theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of gravity,
and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another
in a way that fits previous predictions.</description>

That surviving a disease leaves you better off.

situation in the future.
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿What makes Ebola so dangerous?
How can a virus overwhelm the very complex
defense system of the body so quickly
and so effectively?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what Ebola does.
(Theme music)
Ebola is a virus.
A virus is a very small thing.
A bit of RNA or DNA
and a few proteins
and a hull.
It has no ability to do anything
by itself whatsoever,
and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells.</description>

A war has been raging for billions of years,
killing trillions every single day, while we don&amp;rsquo;t even notice.
The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet:
the bacteriophage
or &amp;lsquo;phage&amp;rsquo; for short.
[Intro + Music]
A phage is a virus;
not quite alive,
not quite dead.
Also, they look as if someone made them up.
Their head is an icosahedron,
a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿The universe looks like a vast empty ocean sprinkled with the rare islands of galaxies.. But this is an illusion. Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies, while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium. Like the roots of some massive tree, gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense, cosmic forest. Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw materials of creation: hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies where they eventually create stars.</description>

The smallest things that have some star-like properties
are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs.

Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
They are really tiny. How tiny?
Compared to Mars or our own moon,
pretty tiny.
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.
Their surface area is up close to some of the smallest states on Earth,
like Luxembourg and Malta.
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,
In reality their gravitational pull isn&amp;rsquo;t even strong enough to bring them into spherical form.</description>

and operate like a large engine for the global climate.
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.

It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature, all made possible by… cows. Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.</description>

But humans have always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendents.</description>

Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years,

the corpses of dead stars&amp;hellip;
white dwarfs.
They could be humanity&amp;rsquo;s last home right before the death of the universe.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿For most of our history, the human population grew slowly,
until new discoveries brought us more food,
and made us live longer.
In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.</description>

Measles is a virus:
a hull of proteins, RNA,

It cannot reproduce by itself; it needs a host cell to do so.

Since the 1960&amp;rsquo;s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially,
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking practically everything we need to stay alive. It looks like we’ll only ever have small crews spend a miserable time hidden underground. Except, we could terraform it into a green new world. But to solve the planet’s problems, we first need to make it worse and turn it into oceans of lava with gigantic lasers.
This isn’t a far-fetched science fiction tale. Terraforming Mars is possible, on the kind of time scale our ancestors built great monuments in.</description>

Every day, it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army.
With soldiers, captains, intelligence officers, heavy weapons, and crazy suicide bombers.</description>

What is evolution?
Evolution is the development of life on Earth.
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.
It shows us how primitive Protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.
Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a Daschund and a Great Dane together:</description>

Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around
30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.</description>

that billions of people would be connected via a kind of web,
that you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitudes more powerful than supercomputers.
It would seem absurd, but then, all of it happened.
Science fiction became our reality, and we don&amp;rsquo;t even think about it.</description>

They’re like giant atom cores.
Kilometers in diameter, unbelievably dense and violent.
But how can something like this even exist?
The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance.
Its own gravity and the radiation pressure of its fusion reaction.
In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium.
Eventually, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted.</description>

They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.
Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces,
and they&amp;rsquo;re exposed to the freezing cold of outer space.
They know no seasons, no days, and no nights, which could give away the passing of time.
And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life

Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms
that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity.

nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy unit produced.

        <description>There&amp;rsquo;s so much text in today&amp;rsquo;s world, pretty much none of us have
enough time to read all the things we wish we had time to. So one
of the most exciting applications I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of
large language models is to use it to
summarise text. And this is something that I&amp;rsquo;m seeing multiple teams
build into multiple software applications. You can do this
in the Chat GPT Web Interface. I do this all</description>

        <description>When I&amp;rsquo;ve been building applications with
large language models, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come to the prompt that
I ended up using in the final application on my first attempt.
And this isn&amp;rsquo;t what matters. As long as you have a good process
to iteratively make your prompt better, then you&amp;rsquo;ll
be able to come to something that works
well for the task you want to achieve.
You may have heard me say that when I train a machine learning model,</description>

        <description>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.
And I want to get started just with a question that is
really basic, but I think chips have been in the
ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a
semiconductor was a few years ago.
Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>

I think people really have fun with it
