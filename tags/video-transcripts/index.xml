Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.

Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it.</description>

declared drug abuse public enemy number one,
starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.
Today, the numbers are in.
The War on Drugs is a huge failure, with devastating unintended consequences.
It led to mass incarceration in the US;
to corruption, political destabilization, and violence
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa;
to systemic human rights abuses across the world.</description>

Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet.
But all they did was invent clever ways of using the internet.
So the person who “invented the internet” should be a gazillionaire

Who should get the credit, then?
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?
Maybe.

Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and trees, rocks and us.
This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.
About 25% is dark matter; and 70% is dark energy.
Both of which are invisible.
This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is
really only a tiny fraction of reality.
But it gets worse.
We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are, or how they work.</description>

In a nutshell
Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size
That can&amp;rsquo;t be split, only created or destroyed.
Light also has a wave-particle duality

Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,
which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.

Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things!
Eating meat has become so trivial that many people

Which is pretty amazing,
since only a few decades ago meat was a luxury product.
Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.

It&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing here, right now.

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿An observable universe is a big place that&amp;rsquo;s been around for more than 13 billion years.
Up to two trillion galaxies made up of something like 20,000 billion billion stars
surround our home galaxy.
In the Milky Way alone,
scientists assume there are some 40 billion earth-like planets
in the habitable zone of their stars.
When we look at these numbers, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that there is nobody else out there.</description>

This is what happens when your body fights cancer, more exciting than any movie. How does this battle for survival unfold?
The Elimination Phase It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It is no longer able to repair its genetic code, it can’t kill itself anymore and it is beginning to multiply rapidly.</description>

While some are juste stupid and funny, others
promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust.
So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system
to destroy not all but a lot of
conspiracy theories. It&amp;rsquo;s really simple, just ask yourself:
Does the theory affect really rich and powerful people?
Is the answer yes? OK, then it&amp;rsquo;s most likely&amp;hellip; Not true.</description>

Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune systems deal with their weapons easily. But there are exceptions.
Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba that has not only developed a deadly taste for human brains but is also a match for our defences and stars in dramatic headlines.</description>

While scientists, activists and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to do anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question: What if the moon crashes into earth? It’s more interesting and weird than you probably think. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics: Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the Moon on its way to crash into us already?
We know that earth’s gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon, but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force. But there is no other force countering gravity - instead, the trick to staying up is a ‘sideways’ motion that we call an orbit.</description>

The Big Bang.
The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite.
Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe
as infinite and ageless.
Until Einstein’s theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of gravity,
and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another
in a way that fits previous predictions.</description>

That surviving a disease leaves you better off.
And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced this.

situation in the future.
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.</description>

A bit of RNA or DNA
and a few proteins
and a hull.
It has no ability to do anything
by itself whatsoever,

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿[Music]
A war has been raging for billions of years,
killing trillions every single day, while we don&amp;rsquo;t even notice.
The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet:
the bacteriophage
or &amp;lsquo;phage&amp;rsquo; for short.
[Intro + Music]
A phage is a virus;
not quite alive,
not quite dead.
Also, they look as if someone made them up.
Their head is an icosahedron,
a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿The universe looks like a vast empty ocean sprinkled with the rare islands of galaxies.. But this is an illusion. Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies, while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium. Like the roots of some massive tree, gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense, cosmic forest. Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw materials of creation: hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies where they eventually create stars.</description>

But let us go back to the beginning…
The World War of the Ants is claiming millions of lives every day. But in the brutal world of ants, straight up war is not the only way.</description>

Things That Would Like To Be Stars
We begin our journey with Earth.

just to get a vague sense of scale.
The smallest things that have some star-like properties
are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs.

Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
They are really tiny. How tiny?
Compared to Mars or our own moon,
pretty tiny.
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.
Their surface area is up close to some of the smallest states on Earth,
like Luxembourg and Malta.
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,
In reality their gravitational pull isn&amp;rsquo;t even strong enough to bring them into spherical form.</description>

They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all.
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years.</description>

and operate like a large engine for the global climate.
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.</description>

The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally. It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature, all made possible by… cows. Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.</description>

But humans have always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendents.</description>

It will probably be a red dwarf; a tiny kind of star.
That&amp;rsquo;s also one of our best bets to find alien life, and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.
So, what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?

Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years,

Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective:
the corpses of dead stars&amp;hellip;
white dwarfs.
They could be humanity&amp;rsquo;s last home right before the death of the universe.</description>

until new discoveries brought us more food,
and made us live longer.
In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.</description>

While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons,
the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.
Since the 1960&amp;rsquo;s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially,
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

Every day, it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army.
With soldiers, captains, intelligence officers, heavy weapons, and crazy suicide bombers.</description>

We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus.
At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species.
Currently, we&amp;rsquo;re slowly transitioning to renewables and if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.</description>

What is evolution?
Evolution is the development of life on Earth.
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.
It shows us how primitive Protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.
Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a Daschund and a Great Dane together:</description>

Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around
30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.</description>

Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years, other civilizations existed on earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out? And that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet?</description>

They’re like giant atom cores.
Kilometers in diameter, unbelievably dense and violent.
But how can something like this even exist?
The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance.
Its own gravity and the radiation pressure of its fusion reaction.
In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium.
Eventually, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone.
They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.
Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces,
and they&amp;rsquo;re exposed to the freezing cold of outer space.
They know no seasons, no days, and no nights, which could give away the passing of time.
And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life
to all corners of the galaxy.</description>

Where do they come from&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;and what happens if you fall into one?
Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms
that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity.
In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium

A chronic dissatisfaction

And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land.
The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year.
The size of the pie was fixed; the world was a zero-sum game.
In such a stagnating world, the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off.</description>

One: nuclear energy saves lives.
In 2013, a study conducted by NASA found that nuclear energy has prevented
around 1.8 million deaths.
Even if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima,
nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy unit produced.
While nuclear waste is really toxic, it’s usually stored somewhere,

of these tasks where the model takes a text as input and

extracting names, kind of understanding the
sentiment of a text, that kind of thing.

be able to come to something that works

        <description>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.
And I want to get started just with a question that is
really basic, but I think chips have been in the
ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a
semiconductor was a few years ago.
Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>

I think people really have fun with it
and they see the possibility
and they see the ways this can help them,
