        <description>Podcast Description Computer scientist Joy Buolamwini coined the term the &amp;ldquo;coded gaze&amp;rdquo; while in grad school at MIT.

He wanted to know why so many evangelical Christians had become extremists, and ardent supporters of Trump. Over the past 4 years, he traveled to churches around the country, reporting on pastors and congregants who backed Trump, and those who felt forced out of their church because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t support him. His new book is The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory.</description>
