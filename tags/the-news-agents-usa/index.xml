It almost sounds ironic. But Trump doesn’t do irony - he's more into inciting violence. Today we speak to former US ambassador Matthew Barzan who worked on the two Obama campaigns. How dangerous is the threat of a Trump presidency in 2024, and, what does it actually look like?

What did Mike Pence really say about certifying Joe Biden as president?
And what does Sean Spicer (ex White House Press Secretary) make of what happened to his former boss Donald Trump after he stopped working for him? We ask him.

We also talk to the Editor-in-Chief of the Cook Report, Amy Walter.
And - is Thanksgiving a waste of time? Jon and Emily discuss (well, disagree).

That’s been the story since Roe v Wade was overturned 18 months ago. And republicans are beginning to panic. Do they have a plan to win back voters? Does it include a softer stance? Also today we hear from a Republican and a Democrat formerly in Congress. If Biden is doing so well, where is the enthusiasm?</description></item><item><title>Is America about to give Donald Trump a second chance?

A year out from 2024, is this purple state closer to staying blue or turning MAGA red? The latter could tip the election in Trump's favour. And we cross state lines to the hometown of the woman who could capitalise should a jail cell call for the Donald.</description></item><item><title>America’s most conservative senator: The Exclusive | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590007/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 06:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590007/</guid><description>Podcast Description We have an exclusive interview on today’s episode with the senior senator from Utah - Mike Lee - who ranks as America’s No1 most conservative senator - in the 538/NY Times poll. We talk to him about the Republican Party, the new speaker, and why he tried to help Donald Trump secure an election he had lost.

Republican representatives are tearing each other apart.
Trump's former lawyers are pleading guilty to election interference in the Georgia trial - each a further potential nail in the Trump legal coffin.
And, out of all this a name is emerging - Liz Cheney who, we understand, is weighing up whether to take Trump on as the Republican's choice for president.</description></item><item><title>Is Biden going to Israel a bad idea? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590009/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590009/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joe Biden is heading head-first into an active warzone. The 80-year-old is travelling to Israel tomorrow to begin brokering the toughest negotiation of his presidency - in an attempt to restore relative calm and peace in the Middle East. It's a dangerous, herculean task that has the potential for domestic and foreign backlash. It will require every ounce of his weighty diplomatic might. We speak to General David Petraeus, formerly the head of the CIA - and military historian Andrew Roberts.</description></item><item><title>A power vacuum in Washington and chaos in the Middle East | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 15:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590010/</guid><description>Podcast Description Just one week ago Kevin McCarthy was booted unceremoniously out of his job as House Speaker. No one could have foreseen then how different the world would look four days later when Hamas wreaked tragedy across Israel. Now there’s a power vacuum in Washington and an unfolding catastrophe in the Middle East. What power does America have to help?
Biden U-turns and starts to build more border wall in the South - with cries of hypocrisy from the right and anger from parts of his own party in the left.</description></item><item><title>MCCARTHY SACKED: Why is the Republican Party eating itself alive? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590011/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590011/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, is ousted by his own party. The first time it's happened in US history. It's the start of a Republican civil war.
Why has it happened? Because he dared to find compromise with the Democrats. What is going on in that party? What does it tell us about the chance of the parties ever working together?
And later, Trump is on trial in New York.</description></item><item><title>Can any other Republican beat Donald Trump?

But perhaps it revealed futility more then anything else. Seven Republican candidates met on stage to battle it our for the nomination. It is incredibly unlikely it will be any of them will win. Meanwhile Donald Trump is with car workers in Detroit. He’s already trying to fight the general election against Biden. Will anything - even a court ruling finding him guilty of decades-long fraud - get in his way?</description></item><item><title>The News Agents USA: Debate Night, Take 2 | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590013/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 17:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590013/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's debate night, second time round in California on Wednesday night. Trump is MIA, again - instead going to fight for blue collar workers by going to Michigan.

He ranted about their power as recently as last year. Yet now, he’s all over the websites he purports to despise - YouTube, TikTok, Rumble. How has he reinvented himself as an alt-right interviewer. And we ask why Donald Trump has changed his position on abortion. Is he already fighting the general election on the airwaves?

It's another normal week in America. David Frum - former speechwriter for George W. Bush - joins us and we ask if any of this is moving the state of political play.

But right now it's the talk of the town. It includes a post-civil war clause that bars anyone from holding public office if they've engaged in an insurrection or rebellion.
Right now, there are lawyers, academics and die-hard constitutionalists who are working out if there's a legal channel to remove Trump's name from any electoral ballot on the grounds he tried to overturn democracy on January 6th 2020.</description></item><item><title>Why are there still racist killings in America? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590017/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590017/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Saturday, a 21-year-old killed three people in Jacksonville, Florida, in a racist hate crime. 60 years on from Martin Luther King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, and three years on from the killing of George Floyd, why does America seem to always go 'two steps forward and then two steps back'?

But the man who’ll almost certainly get it was locked in a rambling conspiracy heavy chinwag with his recently sacked Fox friend Tucker Carlson. Who won the debate on stage? Will any of it shift the dial?

Charged with racketeering in Georgia after allegedly attempting to meddle with election results - and he's now got 91 counts against his name... and counting. Will this change anything? And what about the whataboutery with Hunter Biden and Joe Biden? We speak to Republican strategist who worked in George W. Bush's White House, Ron Christie, Adam Klasfeld, legal correspondent who's followed all 91 charges closely, and Christopher Steele, the British spy who triggered the snowball that led to Trump's first impeachment whilst he was President - for alleged collusion with Russia.</description></item><item><title>Trump, the law, and The Lord | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 19:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590021/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ever wondered what Trump's personal pastor has to say about all the law-breaking that the 45th President allegedly has engaged in? Jon speaks to him on today's episode.
We mull that, and an impending fourth indictment, on The News Agents USA. And we're also joined by Biden's former strategist - who explains what the President has to do to thwart the oxygen-guzzler and limelight-stealer that is Donald J. Trump.</description></item><item><title>Has the Republican Party become 'a cult'? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590022/</guid><description>Podcast Description US prosecutors have charged Donald Trump for attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 Election. It’s the second federal indictment brought against the former president in as many months. We knew this was on the way. So why is he still the leading Republican to be president? And why doesn’t the party care ?
On this episode of The News Agents USA, two former Republican congressmen - one of whom challenged Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election - go head to head on whether Trump is the right person to lead the Republican Party into the 2024 election.</description></item><item><title>Why is Ron DeSantis sinking? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590023/</guid><description>Podcast Description Why is Ron DeSantis losing ground in the polls to an unknown?

We talk to the Washington Post's Olivier Knox about what this means for Trump, his rivals and the ever-quickening race to be the next incumbent of the White House.
Joe Manchin, the highly influential Democrat Senator of West Virginia, seems to be flirting with an independent run for the White House, forging a ticket with a former Republican Governor of Utah.</description></item><item><title>Is Biden really that 'rock-solid' with the UK? | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590025/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joe Biden meets Rishi Sunak in London before flying out to Vilnius to a NATO summit in which he's set to snub the UK government's attempts to have Ben Wallace, Defence Secretary, become the next Secretary General of NATO. The famous 'special relationship' doesn't feel so special any more. Former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker joins Emily and Jon in News Agents USA HQ.
This, all while US news outlets report that the President is a lot less mild-mannered in private than he appears in public.</description></item><item><title>America's Supreme Court - powerful, politicised, and unpoliced | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590026/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590026/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joe Biden - that's President Joe Biden - has said the Supreme Court is "not normal". He's referring to the recent judgements the 9 justices have made - overturning Roe v Wade last year, overruling affirmative action policies at two US universities, refusing to allow the government to cancel student debt, and wading into LGBTQ+ issues on a spurious basis of complaints that don't even exist. Is this overreach?</description></item><item><title>'Doing God' - Trump and the Evangelicals | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590027/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590027/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Tuesday morning, CNN obtained leaked audio of Donald Trump showing classified documents to people who definitely shouldn't be seeing classified documents. He's still denying he didn't have classified documents... but we now have him admitting to it on tape. Surely he can't fudge his way out of this one....
Meanwhile the Republicans have been wooing evangelicals and Robert Kennedy Junior is offering a bizarre counter factual to the Biden democratic nomination.</description></item><item><title>Hunter Biden pleads guilty; Trump doesn't | The News Agents - USA</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1828590028/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1828590028/</guid><description>Podcast Description Breaking news - that has left Republicans speechless for all the wrong reasons. Biden's son Hunter pleads guilty to three federal charges. But they are all miniscule. None of the ones the MAGA (Make America Great Again) gang really care about anyway. Meanwhile, Trump appears on Fox News to explain that he was too busy sorting out his golf shirts from his newspaper clippings to hand back hundreds of boxes of classified highly confidential documents.</description></item><item><title>Trump on Trial.

For once, the Reality TV president ducked the cameras as he appeared on 37 charges of mishandling classified documents and espionage. This is America 2023.
The question is how big a role will he play in America 2024- and the next presidential election.
