[video available on spotify] in life we&amp;rsquo;re presented with a lot of questions that don&amp;rsquo;t have concrete answers, and there are two ways that we can solve these problems. we can go with our gut instinct, which is our brain and body just automatically choosing the answer without thinking consciously. or we can come to a conclusion by really consciously analyzing the problem or
