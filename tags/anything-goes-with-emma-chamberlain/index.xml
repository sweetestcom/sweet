        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] my favorite type of content to consume online is content that tells me how to live my life. i&amp;rsquo;ve adopted so many habits and hobbies from other people that really inspire me. but this overexposure to different opinions and ways to live a good life can also be a bad thing. i think when it becomes a real problem is when we become obsessed with implementing a new habit or hobby into our lifestyle because it really worked for somebody else, but it&amp;rsquo;s just not working for us.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] what does it mean to have good taste in art, music, interior design, fashion, movies, photography? i almost get a gut reaction when i see something and decide whether or not i think it is a sign of good taste. but does it even exist, or is it too subjective? i&amp;rsquo;m not fully convinced that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to go down the rabbit hole together and try to answer the question, what does it mean to have good taste?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] when i was about 12 years old, i read a quote by john lennon that said “when i went to school, they asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up. i wrote down happy. they told me i didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the assignment, and i told them they didn&amp;rsquo;t understand life.” from that point forward, anytime anyone would ask me, emma, what do you wanna be when you grow up?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] here i go again, analyzing another corny quote. on today&amp;rsquo;s agenda, we have a quote that is beloved on social media right now: i don&amp;rsquo;t chase, i attract. we all have a tendency to chase, especially in romantic relationships. i think the concept applies in career as well, but it really hits home for romantic relationships. so today i want to deep dive on this quote specifically within the context of romantic relationships, because i think that’s where it’s the most impactful.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] is it just me, or is it starting to feel like romantic love is an illusion? i&amp;rsquo;m starting to question the concept of romantic love and what that experience is for us as humans because of my own life experiences, but also because the statistics are pretty damning. according to the american psychological association, approximately 40 to 50% of first marriages end in divorce. it&amp;rsquo;s so fascinating to me that something so fundamental to human life seems destined to fail.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] i rarely discuss the business side of my life. and i think that&amp;rsquo;s for two reasons: number one, i fear it&amp;rsquo;s boring, and number two, I feel like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t align with how people see me. but today i&amp;rsquo;m finally going to let the business-minded side of myself speak. a few years ago i started my coffee company, chamberlain coffee. i had this rare opportunity to start a business with little to no experience because my career on the internet gave me the resources to reach out to people who knew how to make a business vision come to life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description approximately three months ago i decided to embark on the journey to quit nicotine for good, and today&amp;rsquo;s episode is going to be focusing on my experience thus far trying to quit. it&amp;rsquo;s been incredibly hard. the reason why i feel the need to say how hard it is, is because people underestimate how severe nicotine addiction can be. i will say, it depends on the person and the level of addiction.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] today we&amp;rsquo;re talking about being rejected. the thing about rejection is that we’ve all experienced it before, and we&amp;rsquo;re all going to continue to experience rejection. it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those things that we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid. we can do everything right, and we&amp;rsquo;re still at risk of being rejected. and i truly believe that when something&amp;rsquo;s inevitable in life, it&amp;rsquo;s much better to focus on finding a healthy way to handle it, than trying to avoid it at all costs.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] in life we&amp;rsquo;re presented with a lot of questions that don&amp;rsquo;t have concrete answers, and there are two ways that we can solve these problems. we can go with our gut instinct, which is our brain and body just automatically choosing the answer without thinking consciously. or we can come to a conclusion by really consciously analyzing the problem or question at hand; what are the pros and cons of taking each action, et cetera?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about us, because today&amp;rsquo;s topic, parasocial relationships, addresses the type of relationship we have. parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party (the persona) is completely unaware of the other&amp;rsquo;s existence. i&amp;rsquo;ve experienced both sides of a parasocial relationship, and as with all things, it can be a little toxic on both sides.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on spotify] we all know stylish people, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to decide whether or not someone&amp;rsquo;s stylish just by looking at them. it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious. but it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to describe what makes somebody stylish, or why somebody is stylish. so today i want to discuss what truly makes someone stylish. but here&amp;rsquo;s something i want to discuss before we even get into it; not everybody wants to be stylish or looks at clothes as a way to express themselves.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description when i experience art, i can almost immediately determine whether or not i think it&amp;rsquo;s good. but i rarely ask myself why it&amp;rsquo;s good. and recently i decided to do that. what&amp;rsquo;s complicated about art is that it’s subjective, and everybody connects to art differently. so good art to one person is bad art to the next person. but i do think that there is an answer to the question, what is good art?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description to romanticize is by definition to deal with or describe in an idealized or unrealistic fashion; to make something seem better or more appealing than it really is. today we&amp;rsquo;re talking about making a deliberate, conscious choice to romanticize life. romanticizing life became sort of a social media trend about turning mundane daily moments into magical moments. i think a lot of us feel really disconnected from the simple pleasures of life due to the sort of fast-paced, highly technological reality we live in today.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] today i have a very special guest. someone who actually shifted my music taste in a big way. today we have mac demarco. when i was like 15 i found his music on vine, and i&amp;rsquo;ve been such a big fan ever since. i think what&amp;rsquo;s so special about mac’s music is the way it always sounds like him. whether it&amp;rsquo;s kind of funky, deep and sentimental, or just an instrumental, it always feels like him.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] there have been many times in my life where i&amp;rsquo;ve found myself feeling really unhappy and not knowing what the issue was. and i&amp;rsquo;ve often realized that in those moments, i was feeling unhappy because i was not living life for me. i was living life for everyone and everything else. i wasn&amp;rsquo;t listening to my own opinions. i wasn&amp;rsquo;t making decisions for me. and what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting about falling into a phase like this is that you don&amp;rsquo;t always notice it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description when i think about it, i actually dislike a lot of people. i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say i hate a lot of people, but i definitely dislike a lot of people. now, to me, there&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between dislike and hate. for the sake of today&amp;rsquo;s conversation, let&amp;rsquo;s look at dislike as a subtle feeling that can be much more easily controlled. i&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wondering recently if i&amp;rsquo;m the problem.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] i think all of us can look at the concept of outfit repeating and say, why is this even a topic of conversation? but what&amp;rsquo;s wild to me is how common it is for people to be concerned about repeating the same outfit more than once. not only have i experienced this pressure to not repeat outfits, but i&amp;rsquo;ve also seen it in the world.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] today i want to discuss the ethics of photo editing on social media. i&amp;rsquo;m not talking about upping the brightness or turning down the contrast on the photo a little bit. i&amp;rsquo;m talking about going in and changing the image completely. smoothing out your skin, making your waist a little smaller or your jaw line a little sharper. you used to have to know how to use professional photo editing software like photoshop to edit photos, and it wasn’t easy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be discussing minimalism in fashion. fast fashion is the business model of replicating recent high fashion design trends, mass producing them at low cost, and bringing them to retail stores quickly while demand is at its highest. trend cycles are insanely fast nowadays, and fast fashion is thriving because a lot of people want to participate in the trends as they happen. but i think a lot of people are sick of this.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description over the past few years, we&amp;rsquo;ve experienced a lot of maximalism across the board. it&amp;rsquo;s been a major lifestyle trend. it&amp;rsquo;s been a major fashion trend. it&amp;rsquo;s been a present theme over the past few years. but i feel like its trendiness might be coming to a temporary end. maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me, but i&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling this collective fatigue. we&amp;rsquo;re sick of it, we&amp;rsquo;re tired of it, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to go back to minimalism.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] we often find ourselves disappointed with other people. there are times when we set realistic expectations for people, such as expecting somebody to treat you with respect, or to follow the law and not steal from you or harm you. those are realistic, normal, healthy expectations to have. but there are times when we become disappointed in people because they didn&amp;rsquo;t meet our expectations. but we have to ask ourselves, did we set the expectation too high?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] why do celebrities choose to stay famous? on the surface level, this question seems easy to answer because most of us look at fame as a dream come true. we see fortune, power, attention, praise. we see all of the positives. but yet, right in front of our eyes, we witness the way that fame ruins people&amp;rsquo;s lives. it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that fame is much more complicated than we think it is on the surface level.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] have you been thinking to yourself, everybody has a podcast these days? i think a lot of people are feeling that way. over the past few years, podcasting has become a real thing. when I was younger, the only podcasts i knew of were ones that were for adults that my parents were listening to. they were all very corporate in the sense that they weren&amp;rsquo;t just individuals turning on a microphone and making a podcast kind of indie style.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] today i’m going to be talking about something that i&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with. in 2023, our identities as human beings are not just confined to our physical being. our identities are now a combination of our online presence and our physical presence. prior to the internet, if you weren&amp;rsquo;t a celebrity, your entire identity was judged based on your physical presence. at this point in time, your online identity and your physical presence equally, in my opinion, shape the way that people perceive you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description i&amp;rsquo;ve had character assassination on my list of topics for weeks now, because it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel particularly relevant to my life. but the topic became incredibly relevant to my personal life recently, so here we are. character assassination is the malicious and unjustified harming of a person&amp;rsquo;s good reputation. i think it can come in two main forms. number one, a completely fabricated story that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an ounce of truth in it, that&amp;rsquo;s created simply to harm someone&amp;rsquo;s reputation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description [video available on Spotify] i’ve been asking myself for a long time, have all creative things been done before? has every piece of clothing been created? has every movie been made? has every song been written? humans have been expressing themselves creatively for thousands of years and part of me is starting to wonder if we’ve hit our limit. have we created everything that’s possible to be created? i know for a fact there are incredible creatives today, but as a whole, it seems like a lot of what’s being produced on a mainstream level is not up to the standard that mainstream creativity used to meet.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description remember when you were a child and constantly had adults telling you what the rules were? don’t lie, don’t steal&amp;hellip; don’t do this, don’t do that. when we’re children, we’re constantly being reminded of certain rules and principles that we’re supposed to follow no matter what. and i think that’s important! but i think in our late teens and early adulthood, we have to take it upon ourselves to find nuance in these rules.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about temptation. which, in my opinion, is one of the most challenging things we deal with as human beings. it&amp;rsquo;s something we deal with whether we&amp;rsquo;re 2 years old or 102 years old. the temptations can change as we get older, but some form of it is always there. the reason i think it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to deal with, is because in the short term, it&amp;rsquo;s often easier and more fun- there&amp;rsquo;s instant gratification.</description>
