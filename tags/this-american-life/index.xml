        <description>Podcast Description There’s a program that brings together kids from two schools. One school is public and in the country’s poorest congressional district. The other is private and costs $43,000/year. They are three miles apart. The hope is that kids connect, but some of the public school kids just can’t get over the divide. We hear what happens when you get to see the other side and it looks a lot better.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are so many cops who look at the killing of Eric Garner or Mike Brown and say race didn&amp;rsquo;t play a factor. And there are tons of black people who say that&amp;rsquo;s insane. There&amp;rsquo;s a division between people who distrust the police — even fear them — and people who see cops as a force for good. Stories of people living on both sides of that divide, and people trying to bridge it.</description>

At Guantanamo Bay, our government initially claimed that prisoners should not be covered by habeas—or even by the Geneva Conventions—because they&amp;rsquo;re the most fearsome enemies we have.</description>

And, for for this episode, the late David Rakoff tried it. He did a 20-day fast, to find out if it would bring him any form of enlightenment.

They say the media doesn&amp;rsquo;t share their values. That secular institutions undermine their beliefs. And the job of raising Christian children, they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you, is like trying to do God&amp;rsquo;s work from behind enemy lines.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard occasional news stories about how some of the drug laws enacted in the last 15 years may have gone too far. First time offenders get locked up for decades. Judges—even Republican appointees—say that mandatory minimum sentences prevent them from making fair rulings. But have sentences really gone too far? This hour examines the areas where a consensus is growing on the problems in federal drug laws, and it explains the areas where drug laws seem to be administered fairly.</description>
