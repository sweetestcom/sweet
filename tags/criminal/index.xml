When Denise was released after being held captive for about 48 hours, police didn&amp;rsquo;t believe her either. It soon became clear that the police viewed Denise and Aaron as suspects, not victims.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In April of 1995, wildlife biologists flew small airplanes over Yellowstone National Park, looking for two missing wolves. “They’re just gone. And that’s implausible because wolves don’t just disappear.” The missing wolves were two of 14 that had been brought down from Canada in an attempt to reestablish the wolf population in Yellowstone. Not everyone supported the Yellowstone Wolf Project—including a man named Chad McKittrick. We speak with Thomas McNamee and Joe Fontaine.</description>

This week, we’re adding to the story with information about the crime he couldn’t tell us before.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After a crime occurs, or when someone dies, the police aren’t responsible for cleaning up. That’s not their job. The coroner takes the body, the police conduct their investigation, and then everyone leaves. But the blood, and the rubber gloves, and the uneaten food in the refrigerator are all left behind. Sandra Pankhurst didn’t like imagining that. So she decided to clean it up. She became a crime scene cleaner.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The U.S. Navy attempted to develop a shark attack repellant after many sailors were attacked during WWII. The first step was the formation of a &amp;ldquo;Shark Research Panel,&amp;rdquo; which led to what we have today: the International Shark Attack File. When someone is attacked by a shark, anywhere in the world, the investigation closely resembles police work. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not reinventing the wheel. There&amp;rsquo;s been no shortage of trial and error that went into police investigations and what we do follows,&amp;rdquo; says George Burgess, the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost shark attack investigator.</description>

The Clergy Consultation Service, an underground network of ministers and rabbis who wanted to help women access safe abortions. Today, they call themselves the Religious Consultation for Reproductive Choice.</description>

Forensic Anthropologists observe decomposition in order to help police officers discern when and how someone may have died. We asked if we could visit, and they agreed.

        <description>Podcast Description On a Sunday morning in 1982, in Des Moines, Iowa, Johnny Gosch left his house to begin his usual paper route.

        <description>Podcast Description Skidmore, Missouri is a very small town. In the &amp;rsquo;70s, there was only one bar, one grocery store, and one bully. Ken McElroy was so ruthless and intimidating that even police officers looked the other way. He terrorized the town for decades, until they finally fought back.

        <description>Podcast Description In 1928, Huey P. Long became the youngest Governor in Louisiana’s history. He bragged that he bought lawmakers like “sacks of potatoes, shuffled ‘em like a deck of cards.” By the time he was 39 years old, he’d made his way to the U.S. Senate. And just a couple of weeks after his 42nd birthday, he was assassinated in the Capitol Building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Allegedly, a doctor named Carl Weiss shot him.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Colorado Department of Transportation says the 420 mile markers on the state&amp;rsquo;s highways were stolen so often, they had to replace them with 419.99 mile markers. Many people know that &amp;ldquo;420&amp;rdquo; represents marijuana - hence the popularity of the mile markers - but very few know why. It&amp;rsquo;s not a police code, it&amp;rsquo;s not the number of chemical compounds in cannabis, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not Bob Marley&amp;rsquo;s birthday.</description>

In 2007, a man named Amir Vehabovic faked his death just to see who showed up at the funeral (answer: only his mom). John Darwin faked his own death in a canoeing accident in the UK. And the ex-boyfriend of Olivia Newton John, Patrick Mcdermott, is rumored to have faked his death. It&amp;rsquo;s an appealing soap-opera fantasy, but actually disappearing requires an incredible amount of planning.</description>

He spent the next six weeks searching for his son, only to find him in the hospital with severe injuries.

        <description>Podcast Description Since 1938, a weekly African-American owned newspaper called The Evening Whirl has covered crime in St. Louis with a style all its own, using alliteration and rhyme, and often omitting the usual crime-reporting words like &amp;ldquo;accused&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;alleged.&amp;rdquo; The paper has been widely criticized for its casual approach to fact-checking and sensational writing style. But the paper&amp;rsquo;s owner, Anthony Sanders, who has been helping out with it since he was 18 years old, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any plans to change it.</description>

Among them is a portrait of one of the earliest American organized crime bosses and conmen, Jefferson Randolph &amp;ldquo;Soapy&amp;rdquo; Smith. And though it may seem strange that this &amp;ldquo;mecca of magic&amp;rdquo; honors a criminal, Soapy&amp;rsquo;s legacy reveals just how blurry the line is between a delightful trick and a dirty one.</description>

At that time, in the early 90s, consumer protection services for identity theft victims were basically non-existent. So the family dealt with the consequences as best they could. But when Axton Betz-Hamilton got to college, she realized that her identity had been stolen, too. In fact, her credit score was in the lowest 2%. As she was working to restore her credit, she inadvertently discovered who had stolen the family&amp;rsquo;s identity: a woman named Pam Elliot.</description>

In prison, Robin Woods found himself using a dictionary to work his way through a book for the first time in his life. It was a Mario Puzo novel.

The exact number of captive tigers in this country isn&amp;rsquo;t known, because many of them live in people&amp;rsquo;s backyards or unaccredited zoos, and the legality of their ownership varies widely by state and even by circumstance. We travelled to Louisiana to see a 550-pound Siberian-Bengal tiger who lives at a truck stop. The owner, Michael Sandlin, has fought very hard to persuade Louisiana lawmakers he&amp;rsquo;s not a criminal.</description>

People thought no jail was strong enough to keep him, but then in 1895 he was sentenced to Philadelphia&amp;rsquo;s Eastern State Penitentiary. At Eastern State, Frankford became the victim of a strange practice: the prison doctor, Dr. John Bacon, dissected his body and removed his brain. The Frankford case would just be one of many others in the region and would illuminate an underground cadaver network supplying medical schools across the state of Pennsylvania.</description>

The first documented use is said to be a photograph from 1886 in which the pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters extends his middle finger to the camera (ostensibly to the rival New York Giants). Even though it&amp;rsquo;s been around for so long, many still find the gesture offensive enough to try to bring criminal charges. Courts have ruled that &amp;ldquo;flipping the bird&amp;rdquo; is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Since 1965, there&amp;rsquo;s been an unsolved murder in Houston, Texas. The main suspect, Charles Rogers, managed to disappear and police were never able to find him. The case is still considered open. In 1997, a couple of forensic accountants named Hugh and Martha Gardenier decided to look into the murders, and were able to uncover evidence that the police missed. And now they think they&amp;rsquo;ve solved the mystery. They wrote a novel about their findings called The Ice Box Murders.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What does it mean when a woman commits a crime and attributes her actions to PMS? We revisit the first use of the &amp;ldquo;PMS defense&amp;rdquo; in this country, back in 1981. What have we learned about the science of PMS since then? Last year, the American Psychiatric Association classified a form of PMS (Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD) as a mental disorder in the DSM-V. How can the scientific community study severe premenstrual symptoms without perpetuating the utterly unscientific idea that menstruating women aren’t mentally competent or liable for crimes they commit?</description>
