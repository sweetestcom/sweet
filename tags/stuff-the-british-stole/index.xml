        <description>Podcast Description Most heists target gold, jewels or cash. This one targeted illegal seeds.
As the British established their sprawling empire across the subcontinent and beyond, they encountered a formidable adversary — malaria. There was a cure — the bark of the Andean cinchona tree. The only problem? The Dutch and the French were also looking to corner the market in cinchona. And the trees themselves were under threat.
Grab a gin and tonic and come with us to hear how a botanical empire took off — and gave birth to a quintessential cocktail.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s round. It has a hole in it. It symbolises nothing and yet it is the possibility of something... meet zero.
The zero we know and love today is the foundation of our modern world. And we have India to thank for it; in particular one special Indian birch bark book — the Bakhshali manuscript.
This is the story of how these fragile pages travelled to Oxford University and what their future looks like.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There&#39;s a body buried in the grounds of Windsor Castle whose real home is thousands of miles away. Since 2007, there have been calls for Prince Alamayu’s remains to be returned to Ethiopia.
But how exactly did this young royal end up alone in England, and buried at Windsor Castle? To answer that we have to go back to 1868 to hear the message the British wanted to send that still reverberates to this day.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In an old country town high school library there is a glass case that displays something highly unusual and, for some, confronting.
Inside that glass case is a mummified head and according to its plaque, it was donated to Grafton High School in 1915.
Now, over 100 years later, questions are being raised about where it really came from and whether it really belongs there.

Now, a team of Greek-Australians have decided that the time for diplomacy is over and a new tactic is required.</description>
