        <description>Our card this week is Aaron Lamont Smalls,
the Ace of Spades from Virginia.
When Aaron was found shot to death in 2001,
investigators dug through piles of tips
and several key pieces of evidence
to try and find his killer.
But each lead seemed to dry up quicker than the last,
and the case eventually went cold.
Now, more than 20 years later,
investigators are still hopeful
that they can uncover the truth for his family</description>

        <description>Our card this week is K. Rue Lolo, the Queen of Hearts from Colorado.
As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already noticed, this is the second episode we&amp;rsquo;re releasing today.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bonus mini episode, a little shorter than a normal one, because there isn&amp;rsquo;t a ton
of information, but we knew that this was a case that still had to be told.
Cases like this are often hard for us to tell because there&amp;rsquo;s not always a lot to the investigation</description>

        <description>Our card this week is James Walker III, the King of Clubs from Kansas.
When James was shot to death at a house party in 2017, local police kicked off an investigation
to find the people responsible.
But they were soon met with obstacles left and right, from lack of physical evidence
to witnesses refusing to cooperate.
Today, both investigators and James&amp;rsquo; family believe the case could be solved if just one</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Sherry Black, the Nine of Hearts from Utah.
This is part two of her story.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, go back and listen to the previous episode because in that I told
you about the start of the investigation into a horrifying murder that rocked the community
of South Salt Lake in Utah.
When we left off, it had been more than a year since the murder.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Sherry Black, the Nine of Hearts from Utah.
In November of 2010, the community of South Salt Lake was shocked by the vicious murder
of a beloved great-grandmother.
Investigators chased leads and interviewed suspects, utilizing every resource at their
disposal to learn who could have committed such a brutal crime and why.
But those answers and justice would remain elusive for nearly a decade, until a dogged</description>

        <description>Our card today is Darlene Hulse, the Four of Hearts from Indiana.
In 1984, mother of three Darlene was brutally attacked in her own home.
Nearly 40 years later, her daughters are still seeking answers,
and there are still new details to uncover.
So, we took our normal reporting one step further.
You&amp;rsquo;ll see what I mean.
A little over two years ago, I came across an old news article.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Deanna Patnode, the Four of Diamonds from Minnesota.
In 1982, 23-year-old Deanna disappeared without a trace from a bar in South St. Paul, Minnesota.
Decades later, a deck of cards would lead to some closure for her family, but ultimately
leave everyone with more questions than answers.

        <description>Our card this week is Joseph Polici, the Jack of Hearts from Connecticut.
Joe was a father of three and a successful restaurateur when he was abducted and shot
to death in 1973.
Everyone in Stanford seems to know who&amp;rsquo;s responsible.
The real mystery is, why hasn&amp;rsquo;t anyone ever been charged with Joe&amp;rsquo;s murder?

        <description>Our card this week is Cassandra Jones, the Queen of Clubs from Kansas.
In 1998, 20-year-old Cassandra vanished from the home
that she and her mother shared in Wichita, Kansas,
only to be found months later, her body discarded on the side of the road.
For the past two decades, investigators have thrown everything they can think of
at her case, trying to untangle the twisted web of mysteries
that her killer left behind.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Desiree Michaud, the Queen of Clubs from Connecticut.
In 1984, 18-year-old Desiree was violently killed in a motel room in southeastern Connecticut.
For nearly 40 years, her murder has haunted the community and stumped investigators as
they&amp;rsquo;ve chased down every promising lead that&amp;rsquo;s come knocking on their door.
But they have yet to find the answers they need to crack this case.

        <description>Our card this week is Kyle Burtis, the Eight of Hearts from Florida.
Today&amp;rsquo;s episode is a special one to me for two reasons.
One, because Kyle&amp;rsquo;s mom, Lynn, actually reached out to us about covering her son&amp;rsquo;s
case.
And two, because I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you his story differently than I typically do.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to walk through Kyle&amp;rsquo;s case the way Lynn had to, remaining in the</description>

This is part two.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to part one, pause here and go back so you can follow along.
In part one, we unpack the beginning of the investigation into the murder of Oki Al Kite
in Aurora, Colorado.
Al was tortured and murdered in 2004, shaking that quiet community to its core.
But early on, detectives had a suspect, Robert Cooper, a man who had rented out Al&amp;rsquo;s basement</description>

        <description>Hey, listeners, before I get into today&amp;rsquo;s story, I just want to give a massive thank
you to all of you because today marks the one-year anniversary of The Deck.
Thank you for your support of this podcast as we dive every week into a new cold case.
And what I love most is that you all don&amp;rsquo;t just listen to these cases.

        <description>Our card this week is Jennifer Wilson, the Nine of Diamonds from Kansas.
In 2002, 29-year-old Jennifer vanished without a trace
after getting into a heated argument with her living girlfriend.
For over two decades, Jennifer&amp;rsquo;s disappearance has puzzled the community.
Because even though investigators think they know who&amp;rsquo;s responsible,
they&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to come up with the answers
to the two remaining questions in her case.
What happened, and where is Jennifer?</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Timothy Blair, the five of clubs from Kentucky.
When Timothy&amp;rsquo;s body was found on the side of the road in 2005, investigators launched
into action to find his killer, but their investigation quickly turned cold despite
the discovery of DNA evidence and the cooperation of his family.
Seventeen years later, Timothy&amp;rsquo;s mother persists in her search for justice, even with
the investigation being put on hold and overshadowed by a whirlwind of rumors that have only led</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Willie Troy Price Sr., the King of Diamonds from South Carolina.
You may have already looked at your feed and noticed, but today I&amp;rsquo;m dropping two episodes
instead of just one.
The stories that you&amp;rsquo;ll hear aren&amp;rsquo;t connected, but they do have something in common.
They&amp;rsquo;re both being investigated as possible cases of mistaken identity.
Cases like these are hard to tell because oftentimes there&amp;rsquo;s just not a lot to the</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Jermaine Johnson, the Two of Spades from Arizona.
In 2006, Central Phoenix was shaken after a beloved member of the community was killed
while he was minding his own business, hanging out with his friends.
For 16 years, Phoenix police have attempted to hunt down the killers, only to hit dead
ends at every turn.
But they have far from given up hope because they know there are people in the community</description>

In 2017, 17-year-old Maggie went missing in rural Park County, Colorado, only to be found
hours later as the victim of the most brutal murder the area had ever seen.
For the past five years, Maggie&amp;rsquo;s horrific murder has weighed on law enforcement in the
small community, as they&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to get any answers to the nagging questions surrounding</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Katherine Sjoberg, the aid of hearts from Wisconsin.
In June 1974, 17-year-old Kathy was enjoying all the festivities of prom night when a heated
argument with her boyfriend at the post-prom dance sent her storming off into the cool
summer night, never to be seen or heard from again.
For nearly 50 years, law enforcement in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, have been haunted by Kathy&amp;rsquo;s

        <description>Our card this week is Donna Ingersoll, the Ten of Clubs from Minnesota.
On a snowy December night in 1990, 25-year-old Donna stormed outside and disappeared into
the night after a heated argument with her boyfriend,
leaving behind several important belongings and a twisted web of mysteries that investigators
have spent decades trying to untangle.
But some recent developments have present-day investigators questioning everything they

        <description>Before we jump into the episode, I have a quick announcement to make.
I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe, but we&amp;rsquo;re actually coming up on the one-year anniversary
of The Deck.
And I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of working on something kind of in secret in the background.
You see, in the middle of investigating all of these cases that we&amp;rsquo;ve told you over

        <description>Our card this week is Kelly Poppleton, the Nine of Hearts from California.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to sharing Kelly&amp;rsquo;s case with you all because it is so close,
and I mean like investigative inches away from finally being solved.
And after almost 40 years of her case going unsolved,
detectives are now ready to share new information
that has never been released to the public.

        <description>Our card this week is Viola Pendergrass, a wild card from North Carolina.
I felt compelled to tell you Viola&amp;rsquo;s story even though she&amp;rsquo;s not featured on a cold
case deck because she was the matriarch of not just her sprawling family, but also those
at the apartment complex where she&amp;rsquo;d lived for two decades.
Residents there even called her Ma.
That is, until one winter morning in 1992 when someone came into her home and viciously</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Rachel Hurley, the Nine of Hearts from Florida.
On St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day 1990, in the picturesque beach town of Jupiter, 14-year-old Rachel
joined a group of friends for an afternoon of boating.
After the teens disembarked a few hours later, Rachel was supposed to meet her mom at their
pickup point, but she never made it.
That night, the middle schooler&amp;rsquo;s body was found in some woods nearby.</description>

        <description>Our cards this week are Joyce Tina Gallegos and Gabrielle DeStefano, the seven and three
of spades from Utah.
In 1982, Tina and Gabby mysteriously disappeared from the same northern Utah city only days
apart.
When their bodies were found just miles from each other, many people took notice of the
similarities in their cases, and a recent development in the case has permanently linked
their two murders.
For 40 years, their cases have been unsolved, but police are still hopeful the right person</description>

In September 2020, the 17-year-old high school basketball player was standing on his front
porch in Wichita, Kansas, hanging out with his family, when he was suddenly gunned down.

        <description>Our card this week is Brian Sullivan, the Three of Spades from New York.
In 2007, 19-year-old Brian was enjoying his summer, hanging out and making music with
friends when one July day he vanished without a trace.
Over the past 15 years, law enforcement&amp;rsquo;s investigation has yielded answers to many
of the questions surrounding his disappearance, but not the one still weighing on his friends
and family daily.

        <description>Our card this week is Dana Ram, the Jack of Hearts from California.
Just shy of New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve in 1986, 20-year-old Dana Ram vanished from a gas station parking
lot in a small California town.
When her body was found the morning after she disappeared, her friends and family were
heartbroken, but they helped police piece together the last moments of Dana&amp;rsquo;s life.

        <description>Our card this week is Roberta Johnson, the Ten of Diamonds from Florida.
In the spring of 1999, 38-year-old Roberta Johnson had a lot to look forward to.
The U.S. Army veteran had a job that she loved, working with at-risk children at a local school.
She was also nine months pregnant and would soon welcome a baby boy into the world.

In February 2020, James was sitting in his Wichita, Kansas apartment when suddenly two
people barged in in the dead of night, shot him and fled, leaving behind a heartbroken
family.
Investigators think they know the motive behind James&amp;rsquo;s murder, but their investigation has

On a cool January evening in 1991, the three roommates hosted a small group of friends

        <description>Our card this week is Mary Frankie Harvey, the Jack of Hearts from Massachusetts.
Forty-two years have passed since Frankie was left for dead in a southeastern Massachusetts
gravel pit.
Frankie&amp;rsquo;s case is unique in a lot of ways, but one reason is because her story straddles
the state line of Rhode Island, where she was last seen alive, and Massachusetts, where
her body was found, which complicated the investigation from the get-go.</description>

In 1994, the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jenny inside her parents&amp;rsquo; safe suburban
house left a community shaken to its core, because not only had a bright and talented
life been suddenly snuffed out, but police struggled to find a motive.
And the more clues they uncovered, the more investigators realized the nightmare they

        <description>Our card this week is Marjorie Fithian, a wild card from Colorado.
It broke my heart when I first heard about what happened to Marjorie and her son,
so even though they&amp;rsquo;re not featured on a cold case card in Colorado,
I knew we had to tell you their story.
And not just because it is so devastating,
but because nearly 50 years have gone by since Marjorie&amp;rsquo;s murder,
and some of the stories surrounding her death are as confusing today as they were back then.</description>

In 1979, 24-year-old Donna was found dead behind a bar,
a bar that she was seen alone at just hours earlier.
Thanks to eyewitnesses, police quickly zeroed in on a promising suspect.
But when the case went to trial, they learned things weren&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as they
seemed.
For more than 40 years, the sexual assault and murder of Donna Tattersall has haunted</description>

In the early 80s, a small town&amp;rsquo;s illusion of safety was shattered when one of its youngest

And her abduction, along with some strange happenings that unfolded after, has haunted
the residents of Sunset, Utah for the last 40 years.

Life was good for the 27-year-old best friends and roommates who had big plans on the horizon.

One that&amp;rsquo;s left their loved ones and police perplexed for over a decade.

On a summer night in 1999, Darwin, a quirky intellectual
who was obsessed with studying spiders,
decided to go out to the bars with some friends
because he had just gotten some amazing news.
But after his final nightcap, Darwin wandered out the side door of a bar

Tony was a rising star in Salt Lake City who had nothing but a bright future ahead of him
in politics.
Until one night in 1978 when someone entered his apartment and viciously attacked him,
leaving behind a still unsolved mystery and complicated questions of motive.
Was Tony&amp;rsquo;s murder a political assassination, a hate crime, or a random attack?</description>

In February 2011, the Phoenix Police Department finally ID&amp;rsquo;d a Jane Doe whose case they&amp;rsquo;d
been working for nearly two decades.
But learning who their victim was was only half the battle.
Investigators have spent the last 11 years since determined to solve her murder.
And their work has led to major breakthroughs in recent years.
And now, some speculate that her tragic ending is connected to three similar crimes.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Randy Leach, the Four of Hearts from Idaho.
When Randy was 20 years old, he decided to take a break from college and hitchhike through

        <description>This is a special episode of The Deck, because the story I want to tell you today is about
a man whose face is not in a cold case card deck.
But we found the case so compelling that we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bring you his story in what we&amp;rsquo;re
going to call a wildcard episode.
There will be other wildcard episodes throughout this year, mostly because when our reporters
travel to do an interview, sometimes they come across other cases that aren&amp;rsquo;t featured</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Anne Klein, the aid of hearts from Indiana.
Anne was a loving wife and devoted teacher who was well on her way to earning a master&amp;rsquo;s
degree, when one winter afternoon in 1973, she was viciously attacked outside her classroom.
This episode is a special one because I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to tell Anne&amp;rsquo;s story ever since I
first heard about it years ago, long before we ever started this show.</description>
