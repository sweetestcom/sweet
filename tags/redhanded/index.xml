        <description>Podcast Description From the outside the Petersons had it all; the perfect family, a beautiful mansion and more money than they could spend. But on 9th December 2001 all that changed, when Michael Peterson claimed to have found his wife, Kathleen, dead at the bottom of their stairs.
What followed would become a bizarre tale of strange family secrets, shocking revelations and a true crime case obsessed over like nothing before, or since.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At 3 am on the 1st of December 2006, Anneli Auer phoned Finnish emergency services – to tell them an intruder was stabbing her husband to death as she spoke.
Police arrived on the scene in less than 10 minutes, but it was too late, and the mysterious killer had seemingly vanished into thin air.&amp;nbsp;
Judicial madness, police fuck-ups, greed, undercover lovers, Satanic child abuse rituals, DNA mix-ups, a family torn apart, and a murder mystery that divided a nation: this is the murder of Jukka Lahti, one of the most notorious cases in Finnish criminal history.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Vanishing in seconds when her older brother turned away, 8-year-old Sarah Payne’s high-profile disappearance gripped the nation. But as mother and father begged for answers and hoped to see their little girl again, sadly it would leave a very different legacy.
This truly heartbreaking case would change the British legal system forever – not before Rebekah Brooks and ‘News of The World’ brought the British media into absolute chaos.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The evidence against Chris Dawson was overwhelming from the start - so why did it take several investigations, 2 coronial enquiries and 40 years of agony for Lyon’s family for New South Wales police to even make an arrest?
In our final episode on the murder of Lynette Dawson we discuss the day of her disappearance and the unfathomable lack of effort put into finding her. Not to mention why the police were so unwilling to investigate a man several officers referred to lovingly as ‘Dawso’.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Lynette Dawson vanished without a trace in January 1982, her husband played the heartbroken victim. He was an abandoned father of two, with no choice but to move a 16-year-old student into the family home to help him out…
This is part 1 of the strange Australian tale. Expect shocking police corruption; rampant sex abuse running wild in the high schools of Sydney’s Northern Beaches; a man who thought he could get away with anything; and his strangely close relationship with his identical twin brother.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The 1984 murder of one of Motown’s biggest stars – at the hands of his abusive, alcoholic, cross-dressing Pentecostal-preacher father – stunned the industry. But despite the media frenzy, almost no justice was served…
In this episode we look at Gaye’s life story, drawing a line from his early traumas to the whirlwind of violence, drugs and sex that seemed to follow him everywhere.
And to tell the whole story, we’re joined this week by Jake Brennan – host of the most-downloaded music podcast EVER: Disgraceland – who dropped in to give us all the essential context behind one of the most notorious crimes in musical history.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 2010, the body of a man was discovered in a locked hotel room in Beaumont, Texas. Apart from some minor bruising on his groin, the man didn’t have a mark on him – yet he had the internal damage of a severe car crash victim.&amp;nbsp;
There was no sign of forced entry or a struggle. He had no enemies, and nobody in the hotel had seen or heard a thing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In August 1982, a Kodak technician was processing some photos when he saw the image of a naked young woman appear. He took a closer look, and any excitement he may have felt quickly disappeared when he realised she had been severely mutilated…
The ensuing investigation led to the conviction of Hong Kong’s first ever serial killer: Lam Kor-wan, known as the ‘Rainy Night Butcher’, or ‘Jars Killer’. Lam had been conducting sick dissections in a tiny bedroom he shared with his unwitting brother – and keeping specimens, suspended in rice wine, in a grim collection of Tupperware containers under his bed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description With fractured knees and savage bruises – weighing just thirty kilos – 23-year-old Anneliese Michel died in 1976 under some of the strangest circumstances imaginable. But despite looking like she’d been held and tortured against her will, she consented to all sixty-seven of the exorcisms she was subjected to.
Why?
Because Anneliese, her parents, and two-priests all believed she’d been possessed by a demon, and had become the mouthpiece of Adolf Hitler, Judas Iscariot, and even Lucifer himself</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In summer 1977, in Alexander City, Alabama, a man stood up in front of 300 mourners at the funeral of a 16-year-old girl – and shot a reverend three times in the head.
When the shooter’s murder trial began, it caught the attention of the renowned author, Harper Lee, who went on to spend years researching the story for her next book.
But it wasn’t the shooting that had piqued her interest.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week, Richard Allen’s defence team dropped a 136-page document challenging the warrant that police used to search his house.
But it’s not as boring as it sounds – because the bulk of this filing consists of claims that Abby and Libby were in fact killed by an Odinite, white-suprematist cult. And in doing so the defence team has revealed a lot of new information regarding the crime scene.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If Seth Rich had had any other job – or if it had been any other year – his tragic death would likely have joined the 65 other unsolved murders in his part of Washington DC that year. But Seth worked for the Democratic Party – and this was the summer of 2016.
And while his family tried to grieve, Seth’s story was co-opted by every side. Through social media echo-chambering and shameless self-promotion, it grew to include accusations of bloodthirsty politicians; allegations of foreign powers destabilising US elections; and a secretive, high-powered paedophile ring that went all the way to the top.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1994, in the back garden of a house on Lorain Road, San Marino, California – workers accidentally unearthed a shallow grave containing dismembered human remains.&amp;nbsp;
Investigators were convinced that the discovery had something to do with a charming British man who’d lived at the property a decade before. Not only had he been a member of the British royal family, a celebrated actor, a director, an art collector, a physicist and a naval captain… but he was also a member of the Rockefeller family – with the same social security number as serial killer David Berkowitz…</description>

Then she vanished.&amp;nbsp;
A few months later a body was found near where Shannan, vanished - but it wasn’t her.&amp;nbsp;
And neither were the next 9 sets of human remains they found along Ocean Parkway.&amp;nbsp;

And now this seemingly young, meek, slightly goofy, “vanilla” girl – whose bedroom was filled with stuffed animals – is now Britain’s most prolific child serial killer.&amp;nbsp;

Little did they know at the time, that these maroon-robed chanting hippies and their money-loving spiritual leader would go on to overthrow the local government, attempt wide-scale voter fraud, plot to fill a plane with explosives and eventually, carry out the most significant act of bioterrorism in US history.</description>

Killing two adults and injuring nine children – allegedly just because she didn’t like Mondays – Brenda has lived on in infamy as one of America’s first school shooters, immortalised by Bob Geldof and The Boomtown Rats.

Word spread that Thabo Bester, the infamous “Facebook Rapist”, had set himself and his cell on fire. And all that remained after the dramatic blaze were a lighter, and a body, burnt beyond recognition. But that’s far from the end of the story.&amp;nbsp;
With daily revelations from the trial still hitting headlines, expect a farcical morgue-robbing scheme, a massive-scale web of fraud conducted from inside a prison cell, and a glamorous celebrity doctor who’s not quite what she seems.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Graphic Sonic fanfiction, a botched DIY sex change, incest and relentless psychosexual trolling are just some of the hallmarks of Christine Weston Chandler&#39;s story. As one of the most documented people in history – with 2,500 Wiki articles covering everything from school reports to her parents’ friends – her almost biblical tale leaves little to the imagination. Yet most people have never heard of her.&amp;nbsp;
Despite decades of online abuse, manipulation, and even extortion, the majority of those who do know about the infamous ‘Chis Chan’ see her as little more than an internet joke.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Last week, we looked at the formation of the ultra-obedient, bigamist Mormon cult, the FLDS – in which plural marriage to pregnant preteen girls is just the tip of the fundamentalist iceberg. In this second part, we look at how its new prophet, Warren Jeffs, took his so-called religion to ever stricter and more terrifying depths.&amp;nbsp;
With followers so beaten down that they were banned from even laughing; the prophet on the lam, living it up at Disneyland; and a team of ex-faithfuls and dogged investigators closing in – something had to give.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description According to Warren Jeffs’ thousands of followers, he was the leader of a secretive but devoted religion – their prophet, and the representative of God on Earth. But according to US law, he was a dangerous, totalitarian, child-molesting horror with over 80 wives – some married off as young as 12. Still, according to the church, Earthly laws are no match for the voice of God.
In this episode, we explore the story behind the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints: how the visions of a charismatic, seventeen-year-old farmhand grew to become a major world religion; how plural marriage caused a major rift in the church; and how its teachings were warped into a systematic cult of child abuse, underage sex, and absolute power.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 2009, the horror film ‘Orphan’ told the tale of a couple who unwittingly adopted a 9-year-old girl, who (spoilers) turned out to be a murderous, adult woman.
Sometimes though, reality is stranger than fiction. A year after the film’s release, the Barnetts, a wealthy picture-perfect American family, adopted 6-year-old Natalia Grace from Ukraine. But within just 3 years, they’d abandoned her and fled to Canada.&amp;nbsp;
Why? According to the Barnetts, Natalia – who had a rare form of dwarfism – wasn’t a little girl at all.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Violently stabbed to death in their own home, the bodies of Debra and Marc Richardson showed the signs of an almighty struggle.
The body of their eight-year-old son Tyler Jacob was upstairs, and their twelve-year-old daughter Jasmine was missing. It all suggested a brutal home invasion, with Jasmine’s abduction as the motive. Yet the narrative the police unwound was more confusing, disturbing – and downright cringe-worthy – than anything they could have imagined.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On 14th June 2017, a fire engulfed Grenfell Tower, a high-rise residential building in West London.&amp;nbsp;
74 people died, and the tragedy became one of the darkest days in recent British history.
But worst of all, the incident was completely avoidable. This is the story of how decades of government corruption and unbelievable corporate greed killed so many innocent people.
As part of our coverage of the Grenfell case, and to support those still affected today - we’re going to be donating a portion of our ad revenue from this episode to the Grenfell Foundation.</description>

Tupac Shakur was one of the decade’s biggest and most admired music icons – until his life was cut tragically short in 1996.

But for the police, only one question mattered: where was the sixth? Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès was nowhere to be found. And as they dug into his past, they uncovered a story that’s obsessed the nation of France for years: one of an ancient aristocratic dynasty, of international espionage, and a crime scene that, decades later, still refuses to add up…</description>

Francois Duvalier, known as ‘Papa Doc’, is one of the most ruthless dictators of the 20th Century, responsible for the deaths of an estimated 60,000 people, and a reign of terror that tragically reverberates through Haiti to this day.</description>

In reality, she was in her early fifties, and was using her self-made status as a ‘pillar of the community’ to divert attention away from what was buried and rotting in her garden. Whether her victims had a few hundred thousand dollars, a nice pick-up truck, or even just a meagre social security cheque – they all risked the wrath of the ‘Death House Landlady’.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The much-told legend of Rasputin – the giant, wild-eyed, well-hung, wandering Siberian monk who seduced the Tsarina herself – is mostly a bunch of absolute borscht. But the real story is just as wild. H&amp;amp;S look at the life of a peasant who infiltrated Russian nobility, embodying the tensions of a nation – a charismatic zealot who mysteriously healed the Romanovs’ sickly heir. So join us to find out how Russia went from Romanovs to Revolution; the possible MI6 ties to Rasputin’s death; and a classic, quick-fire RedHanded rundown of…the entire First World War.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 2009, having served just 13 months of the cushiest jail sentence this side of Scandinavia, Jeffrey Epstein was free – and legally protected from any future punishment. But there were hundreds of people that knew what he really was: a dangerous, influential and insatiable child rapist with a sophisticated network of fixers. They knew he had to be stopped.
In this second episode of our two-parter, H&amp;amp;S look at the tireless legal and journalistic efforts to bring him down; go deeper into the involvement of Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew; and find out what kind of justice – if any – was served.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The story of Jeffrey Epstein – the billionaire financier with an industrial-scale web of child abuse implicating some of the most powerful people in the world – sounds like some half-baked conspiracy theory. But it’s all true. And to answer the question of how he went from humble origins to sex-trafficking minors over to his private island, we have to start at the very beginning. So, who exactly was Jeffrey Epstein?</description>

Last week, the probable cause affidavit was released, revealing jaw-dropping evidence against the 28 year old.

        <description>Podcast Description Modern medicine’s come a long way since the days of old where doctors would drill a hole in your head for a cold, prescribe you a tobacco-smoke enema, suggest you brush your teeth with urine, or give you heroin as cough medicine.
But things really did get a whole hell of a lot worse before they got better… Lobotomies were performed on tens of thousands of psychiatric patients, misbehaving children, “hysterical” women, JFK’s sister, and the former First Lady of Argentina – all just in the last 80 years.</description>

According to McKinney, everything was above board – Kirk just liked things kinky. But the British tabloids only cared about one thing: the wisecracking Southern belle Joyce McKinney made for great headlines.</description>

The mystery surrounding Olof Palme’s death is a Swedish national obsession that&amp;rsquo;s barely left the headlines in the decades since. Hundreds of theories, from international hitmen to lone gunmen and police conspiracies, have swirled around one of the most extensive murder investigations in history.</description>

Krugersdorp, a town northwest of Johannesburg, has always had high levels of violent crime. But when South Africa’s own satanic panic kicked into full force in the early 90s, its citizens had an altogether more unholy threat on their hands&amp;hellip;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This case takes the notion of life imitating art to a newly macabre extreme. In 2010, Blake Leibel released his graphic novel, Syndrome. Described as The Truman Show meets Se7en, the story follows a rogue neuropathologist as he attempts to find a cure for evil, using a condemned serial killer as his guinea pig.
Initially met with a lukewarm response, the novel garnered international attention in 2015 after Leibel seemed to use its most violent scenes to commit what&amp;rsquo;s been described as &amp;ldquo;the most brutal murder in LA&amp;rsquo;s history&amp;rdquo;.</description>

As the therapy continued, more and more brutal confessions came, until he was linked to 39 of Sweden’s most infamous murders. He became known as the nation’s answer to Hannibal Lecter – a sadistic, cannibalistic serial-killer paedophile.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the early morning of 1 July 2018, Gurcharan Singh went to check on his neighbours in the Burari district of Delhi. When he got there, he found a crime scene so chilling that the whole city was thrown into a frenzy. Ten members of the Chundawat family were hanging from the ceiling. Another, the 80-year-old grandmother, was found strangled in the next room. And the police, the public, and the national media were stumped – it seemed too complex for suicide; too organised for murder.</description>

But his years of isolation and abuse weren’t the work of a kidnapper – they came from the woman he loved.

But on closer inspection, things just didn&amp;rsquo;t add up. Why would the would-be robbers shoot Hann and Bich Pan in cold blood, but leave their 24-year-old daughter Jennifer relatively unharmed? Why didn’t they drive off in the expensive Lexus that was parked in the drive? And why would Hann Pan run from the house, leaving his daughter tied to a bannister?</description>

In May 2013 he used Georgia&amp;rsquo;s good nature against her and eventually guilted the 16-year-old into coming over to his parents&amp;rsquo; house to take part in a &amp;ldquo;fake murder&amp;rdquo; photoshoot, that soon turned out to be all too real.</description>

It&#39;s where, in 2019, a British journalist found an 18-year-old, 9-month pregnant Shamima Begum. Soon after this discovery, Shamima Begum would have her British citizenship revoked, leaving her stateless in the desert hell-hole.
In the concluding episode of this series, the girls discuss how ISIS used religion to justify sex slavery, the fall of the so-called caliphate and what should be done with individuals like Shamima Begum.</description>

And it was during this time, that a dangerous man roamed the streets committing a series of gruesome murders so diabolical that he terrified people who had survived the nightmares of WW1.</description>

This already unpleasant job was made much worse by the distinctly hand-shaped bones mixed in with lumps of human flesh blocking the drains. This discovery would lead to the arrest of Britain&#39;s most notorious necrophile, Dennis Nilsen.

A plethora of evidence was left behind at the scene, including DNA, fingerprints, half-eaten food and even an entire outfit, but still to this day this case remains one of Japan&#39;s most notorious unsolved murders.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For decades, TV presenter Jimmy Savile was idolised as a national treasure in Britain. But the power and adoration Savile enjoyed was matched only by his perversions and depravity&amp;hellip;
He was knighted, awarded an OBE, he rubbed shoulders with royalty, prime ministers and he ruled the roost at the BBC. Savile also raised millions for charity, for which he was rewarded with the literal keys to hospitals and children&amp;rsquo;s homes across the country.</description>

But, in all those years, despite the thousands of hours of police work spent trying to find Cindy&#39;s tormentor, detectives had nothing more than a bizarre phone message to show for it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Between 1993 and 1998, eight women went missing from an area around Dublin that became known as the ‘Vanishing Triangle’. Was there a link? Speculation abounded. There were whispers of a serial killer, responsible for some, if not all, of these cases. But nobody was ever brought to justice.
Twenty years later, the brutal murder of Jastine Valdez disturbs crime novelist Claire McGowan into action. Reminded, like many in Ireland, of those previous missing women, McGowan brought her skills as a novelist to the real world, setting out to uncover the truth of the vanishing triangle.</description>

In this episode, Suruthi and Hannah follow the trail of destruction created by Blahyi, and ask can a man once dubbed “the most evil man in the world” really change?</description>

Despite all signs pointing to the Milat family, the real challenge for police was finding which of the ten Milat brothers to point the finger at.</description>

Roch Thériault held a vice-like grip over his loyal followers, so tight that they would abandon their children to his surgical madness, and so firm they would abandon their partners for his harem.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Leonarda Cianciulli was consumed by fear thanks to a curse her mother had placed on her. She had learned all she could about black magic from the Romani travellers who passed through her little Italian town, but still the deadly effects of the hex persisted - at least in Leonarda&#39;s mind.
As she grew desperate, and immersed herself further into the occult, Leonarda realised it was all about the &#39;law of equivalent exchange&#39;; to save a life, she&#39;d have to take a life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Happy Valentine&#39;s Day! (Whatever that means...) This week as a special gift for all of you, we’ve cut together all of the best bits of a segment we do on our after show Under the Duvet called “EmptyHanded”. EmptyHanded is the everlasting discussion of the occasional highs and inevitable lows of our dating lives. We’ve got Japanese Horror Porn, we’ve got Kermit GIFs, we’ve even got blue ticks. It’s a dumpster fire, and we wouldn’t have it any other way (or perhaps we would…).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At 1:14pm on 2 October 2018, Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Within minutes he was killed and dismembered by a 15 man hit squad sent from Riyadh.
To this day Jamal’s remains have never been found. And aside from a secretive trial conducted by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the man who according to the CIA and Turkish intelligence ordered the hit - Jamal has had no justice.</description>

He then detonated a bomb in the government quarter of Oslo, before heading to the island of Utøya, where he would become Norway&#39;s worst mass murderer - after taking the lives of 77 people, mainly teenagers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Adrian Lim&#39;s fascination with the occult, and his obsession with power, drove him to transform himself into a black magic &#34;bomoh&#34;. He promised his followers whatever they desired, but in exchange he would need from them, everything that he desired...
Lim&#39;s depravity quickly escalated; he became increasingly violent, turned his attention to younger and younger victims, revelled in torture, rape and eventually murder.

        <description>Podcast Description On Halloween night 1979, 16 year old Lynette Ledford was on her way home from a party when she vanished.

        <description>Podcast Description On 12 March 2004, police walked into an office building in Fresno, California and found the bodies of 9 women and children; they had each been shot once in the eye. It was discovered that all of the victims shared the same biological father, a man named Marcus Wesson - but this man was also all of their “husbands”.
This shocking find unravelled a twisted tale of incest, abuse, rape and vampires.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When 18 year old, Peter, woke up in a mystery flat after a night out he was scared. It was then with horror that he realised he couldn&#39;t move his arms, and a strange man was sexually assaulting him...
That man was Reynhard Sinaga; and thanks to Peter, in January 2020, Sinaga was finally convicted of 159 sexual offences, including 136 counts of rape. For years he&#39;d been preying on the men of Manchester, England - attacking with impunity and going totally undetected thanks in large part to his innocent looks, and the copious amounts of GHB that he plied his victims with.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The 6th of December 2019 marks the 30 year anniversary of the Montreal massacre, a dark day in Canadian history. It was the day that gunman Marc Lépine walked into an engineering school and shot dead 14 female students. As he shot the women, he exclaimed that he hated feminists, and that feminists had ruined his life. This sentiment was backed up in his manifesto. A manifesto that shares a great number of themes with that of Isla Vista killer Elliot Roger, or the motivations the 2018 Toronto van killer, Alek Minnassian.</description>

At first the police didn’t take her seriously, but then she elaborated that the reason this ghost was haunting her, was because she had helped to torture a young woman named Fan Man-yee to death. The girl then led police to a flat in the city, and what they found there shocked even a nation going through an already unbelievably violent decade.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Between 1986 and 1987 in Pennsylvania, self-appointed “Bishop” Gary Heidnik abducted six women and held them prisoner in a pit that he’d dug into the floor of his basement. The brutal torture that these women suffered at Heidnik’s hands is incomprehensible - especially when you consider that the entire time Heidnik was running his own church just meters above where these women were trapped.

        <description>Podcast Description In 1966 Robert, Helen and Joy Sims were murdered in a grim “Strangers” style slaying in their home in Tallahassee, Florida. Nothing was taken from the house, nothing was left behind, there was no sign of forced entry and no one reported seeing anyone suspicious in the area - police were stumped.
But massive overkill on 12 year old Joy Sims suggests that not only was she the intended target, but that this was personal.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over the course of two summers across Belgium six young girls went missing - their captor, Marc Dutroux, seemed untouchable as he brazenly abducted, imprisoned, raped and murdered his young victims.
But this is much more than a sad story about a sick, sadistic pedophile; how Dutroux evaded arrest time and time again raises serious questions as to whether he was just a small part of a powerful pedophile network stretching to the highest levels of Belgian society.</description>
