        <description>Will there be a war between U.S. and China in the 21st century?
If there is, we&amp;rsquo;re finished.
A war between the U.S. and China would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth.
The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky, his second time on the podcast.
This episode is focused on the war in Ukraine.

we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to sort of calculate
the lion&amp;rsquo;s kinetic energy and is it optimal
to go this way or that way, you just react it.
And physically our bodies are well attuned
to actually make right decisions.
But when you&amp;rsquo;re playing a game like poker,
this is not something that you ever evolved to do.

It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there&amp;rsquo;s

        <description>The real foundation of Marx&amp;rsquo;s political philosophy was the economic argument that there would
be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that tendency for the rate of profit to
fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than their
subsistence, a revolt by workers against this, and then you would get socialism on
the other side.

Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. These are exploitative
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

        <description>when you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a, I never think opening,
I never think final, I think soundscape
of how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling right now.
So it could be the middle of the song
for all I know when I&amp;rsquo;m doing that.
But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody
and music really come at the same time.
Like by same time, I mean, as I&amp;rsquo;m expressing maybe,</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,
his second time on the podcast.
Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,
specializing in 20th and 21st century history
of Russia and Eastern Europe.
And he has written what is widely considered
to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes,
two of which have been published.
And the third focused on World War II
and the years after he is in the midst of writing now.</description>

        <description>he made me think that, you know, everything was going to be reversed and okay, and anybody that
money was borrowed from, they would get it back, you know, maybe tenfold.
And so it was this weird situation of having like one foot in his reality and potentially
believing the things he was saying or even over time wanting to believe them more and more because
the alternative was so, the alternative was worse.</description>

a standup comedian and podcaster,
and one of the funniest humans on the planet.
And just someone who brings joy to my heart
with a mix of non-sequitur absurdity,
darkness, and the singing voice of an angel.
In all seriousness, Bobby&amp;rsquo;s just a beautiful human being.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of his for 20 years,

The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.
He&amp;rsquo;s one of the greatest filmmakers of all time
with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.

        <description>I hate affirmative action.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just disagree with it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just think it&amp;rsquo;s against the 14th Amendment.
I hate it.
The hatred comes from an understanding
that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute
for the actual development of the capacities
of our people to compete.
They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.
We&amp;rsquo;re gonna have a separate program for you.
We&amp;rsquo;re gonna give you a side door that you can come into.</description>

And I also think there&amp;rsquo;s a case to be made
that you can&amp;rsquo;t really have fiat without war.
The following is a conversation with Safety Namus,
one of the central and most impactful economists,
philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.

He and colleagues do some of their research out in space,
experiments on space missions that seek to discern
the molecular basis of changes in the human body
during long-term human space travel.
On this topic, he also wrote an epic book
titled The Next 500 Years,

Bad Men, The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,
Harassment, and Assault,

        <description>We are becoming cyborgs.
Our brains are fundamentally changed.
Everyone who grew up with electronics,
we are fundamentally different from previous,
from homo sapiens.
I call us homo techno.
I think we have evolved into homo techno,
which is like essentially a new species.
Previous technologies, I mean,
may have even been more profound
and moved us to a certain degree,
but I think the computers are what make us homo techno.</description>

the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone
and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,
the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.
You expect to have a full day of battery life,
but then you want it to not be sending data
into 10 or 100 megabits.
You want gigabits.
You want it to be able to have eight core processors.</description>

I would like to know.
Two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet,
what&amp;rsquo;s that look like exactly?
When you see them and they see you,
you&amp;rsquo;re assuming they have vision,
they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.
That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of assumptions they&amp;rsquo;re making.

        <description>we would come up to these rafts and these boats
that were in really dire shape and people would be pushed off
and people would jump off
and people would fall into the water
and some of them couldn&amp;rsquo;t swim.
And so we found ourselves in this moment
where we had a choice.
We could film someone drown in front of us
or we could put our cameras down

        <description>If you get into the sauna the way I just described,
not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,
twice a week or three times per week,
you reduce the likelihood of dying

If you do it four or more times per week,
you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.
Is there any scientific evidence
that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?</description>

and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you&amp;rsquo;re actually inflating the money supply
at 7% but you&amp;rsquo;re calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you&amp;rsquo;re literally bleeding

        <description>If you read a half hour a night,
the calculation I came to is that you can read

All of the components are there

Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery,

        <description>The jury found Pfizer guilty of fraud
and racketeering violations.
How does Big Pharma affect your mind?
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s allowed their own opinion.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think everyone&amp;rsquo;s allowed their own scientific facts.
Does Pfizer play by the rules?
Pfizer isn&amp;rsquo;t battling the FDA.
Pfizer has joined the FDA.

How hard do you think it is for aliens

        <description>I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of consciousness.
Do you think we&amp;rsquo;re living in a simulation?
We could be in the matrix, this could be a very vivid dream.
There&amp;rsquo;s going to be a few people that are now visualizing a pink elephant.
A hamster has consciousness.
Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.
Consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Zev Weinstein,
a young man with a brilliant, bold and hopeful mind
that I had the great fortune of talking to
on a recent afternoon.
He happens to be Eric Weinstein&amp;rsquo;s son,
but I invited Zev not because of that,
but because I got a chance to listen to him speak
on a few occasions and was captivated
by how deeply he thought about this world</description>

a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer
previously at MIT and now the founder and CTO
of Axion Systems,
specializing in efficient space propulsion engines
for satellites and spacecraft.
So these are not the engines that get us
from the ground on Earth out to space,
but rather the engines that move us around in space
once we get out there.

I did not previously publish this conversation

And as a result, it did not receive many listens.
Let me be honest and say that while I usually
don&amp;rsquo;t care about how many listens or views something gets,

He&amp;rsquo;s a professor at Harvard doing research
on infectious disease and immunology.
