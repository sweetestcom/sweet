        <description>Podcast Description Enoch warned the Giants and the Watchers of the world. Repent or feel God&#39;s wrath.
They ignored his warning.
The floodgates of Heaven burst forth and water rushed over the Earth, destroying everything. The only thing to survive is a single vessel, a huge ship: the Ark. 5 months later, the waters receded and the Ark made ground on a mountaintop. A man named Noah emerged, and civilization began again.</description>

But two sailors didn&#39;t reappear at all. The two men, who happened to be brothers, were presumed dead or lost.
They weren&#39;t dead.</description>

Wright-Patterson AFB got lots of UFO reports. 99% of them could be explained. And a sizeable percentage of those sightings were hoaxers looking for attention.
The other 1% were classified as UFOs and sent on to Project Blue Book. What happened from there, McLeod didn&#39;t know.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are over 7 billion people living on the earth right now. Tens of millions are born and die each year. Every single one of us leaves signs of our existence in the air, water, soil -- even space.
But these signs won&#39;t last forever. Our buildings will be gone in a few hundred years. Our stone monuments, plastic, styrofoam, twinkies, even evidence of our inevitable nuclear destruction will eventually be gone.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You’re not supposed to be alive. None of us are. About 10 years ago, you woke up to an eerie silence. The power was out. You went to check your phone for news but your phone was dead.
Then you realized, everything was dead. Some kind of blackout, you thought.
You looked out your window, confused. It looked like a normal December morning. Holiday decorations were up, though all the Christmas lights were out.</description>

Sensing a final opportunity for adventure, explorer G.E. Kincaid took a boat down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon. The canyon was rich in minerals like gold, silver and copper and Kincaid wanted to see what he could find before the area was closed off for good.</description>

But one woman wasn&#39;t satisfied. Cynthia Hind drove around the capital city of Harare, searching for the source of the sound but, nothing seemed unusual. But back at home, Cynthia&#39;s phone rang relentlessly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What if all of our online existence is fake?
You, me, everyone; we&#39;re living in a real-life Matrix. Designed to distract us from the truth: that we&#39;re just drones in a digital ant-hill. We live, work and die so that the wealthy and powerful can grow more wealthy and powerful.
This is called the Dead Internet Theory. And there&#39;s compelling evidence that it&#39;s real.

Some caves are reported to be secret entrances to underground bases. And not all of those bases are occupied by humans.
Other caves are rumored to be portals to different places on earth.</description>

The machine produced a small circular area of distortion. It was a vortex about eight inches across that looked like ripples above a fire. This was unexpected. Mike didn’t know what the vortex was or if it was dangerous. So he grabbed a sheet-metal screw and tossed it through the field.
It vanished.
Mike just stared and blinked and waited.</description>

Is this reality? Well, we&#39;re experiencing ... something right now so maybe the better question is: what is reality?
Could everything we see, everything we experience, everything that exists in our entire universe -- be artificial? Supporters of Simulation Theory believe that not only is it possible that we&#39;re living in a simulation; it&#39;s likely.
And the more we look for evidence, the more we find.</description>

They shared a common governance and similar religious beliefs.
Our ancestors lived, as we do today, as a global society.
Around 14,500 years ago, this global superpower started to collapse.</description>

They&#39;d aimed toward Pluto. Which lives in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt.
Just before arriving at the dwarf planet, the team noticed an object nearby. And it was acting very strange. This object, whatever it was, was spinning faster than everything else around it.</description>

The signals coming from the Black Knight Satellite have been decoded.

        <description>Podcast Description Since grade school, we’ve been taught that gravity is what keeps our feet firmly planted on the ground, but what if that’s all been a lie?
I&#39;m not saying if you jump off a bridge, you fall up, instead of down. But what if Newton and Einstein were wrong and what *really* ties our universe together is not gravity, but electricity?
The Electric Universe Theory says that, instead of gravity, the universe&#39;s *true* attractive force comes from invisible electric currents that surround our planet, our solar system, the galaxy and.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1966 a well-known engineer released a book with information that could impact everyone on earth. But before anyone could read it, it was classified by the CIA.
We only learned of its existence a few years ago because of a Freedom of Information request.
The CIA only released 57 pages of the original 284-page manuscript. And those pages have been, in the CIA&#39;s own words, &#34;sanitized&#34;.
Why does the CIA think this book is so dangerous that they had to hide it from the public for 60 years; and continue to hide most of it?</description>

One of our ancestors created fire and passed that knowledge along to the next generation. Then the invention of the wheel. Then agriculture, a writing system, mathematics, space travel.
Within our story, empires rise and fall. Technology progresses. Civilizations are born and die. The human race continues to innovate.
All of our innovations are built on previous ones.</description>

Animal experts were brought in to identify it. They were stumped. It looked like part dog, part reptile and part rodent - with the beak of a bird.</description>

You’re a trapped animal in a cage: a virtual reality created more than 250,000 years ago for a single purpose: to use you as food.
Your emotions are food for those who created the cage. Feelings of happiness and joy are digestible. But those emotions are nowhere near as nourishing as sadness, malice, and especially anger.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On July 6, 2022, a bomb detonated on a 5-acre plot of farmland in Elberton, Georgia. The explosion destroyed a large monument that had stood on the property for over 40 years.
Known as &#34;The Georgia Guidestones&#34;, it was four monolithic slabs of granite, weighing over 230,000 pounds, that contained a set of rules for a more peaceful and orderly society. The identity of the builder was a mystery for 40 years, but today I&#39;ll tell you who he was.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1966 a well-known engineer released a book with information that could impact everyone on earth. But before anyone could read it, it was classified by the CIA.
We only learned of its existence a few years ago because of a Freedom of Information request.
The CIA only released 57 pages of the original 284-page manuscript. And those pages have been, in the CIA&#39;s own words, &#34;sanitized&#34;.
Why does the CIA think this book is so dangerous that they had to hide it from the public for 60 years; and continue to hide most of it?</description>

You&#39;re drifting off to sleep; or maybe you wake up in the middle of the night. You feel a presence in the room.
You see something out of the corner of your eye. You try to look but you can&#39;t move. You try to call out, but you&#39;re unable to make a sound. There&#39;s an invisible weight on your chest. Even breathing is difficult.</description>

As you move closer, the dog stands up on its hind legs. It&#39;s well over 7 feet tall. It has the body of a man but the head of a dog or a wolf.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 12th century England, two children were found lost in a forest. They spoke only gibberish, wore strange clothing and had bright green skin. When the children finally learned to speak English, they described where they were from. And that&#39;s why, after almost 1,000 years, people still talk about The Green Children of Woolpit. In 1828, a teenage boy was shuffling through a public square in Nuremburg. He seemed confused and disoriented.</description>

Which says that back in 1000 AD, there was a conspiracy between the church and the Holy Roman emperor to change the calendar. The years 614 through 911 were completely made up. Those 300 years just didn&#39;t happen. So all that history you learned about Charlemagne and the middle ages.</description>
