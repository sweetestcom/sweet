        <description>Podcast Description The Labour leader has Covid-19, which means a campaign rejig and a protracted squabble with Christopher Luxon about who is quitting the Press debate and who isn’t. Meanwhile, Winston Peters has gone into bombastic overdrive, parts of the campaign have gotten ugly, and a clutch of new polls indicate tight races in Auckland Central, Tāmaki, and Hauraki Waikato. Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas take the pulse. Plus: Christopher Luxon has declined to be interviewed by The Spinoff or on the pod.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the second leader debate, Chris Hipkins went full-mojo against Christopher Luxon. Did it work for him, or did he overdo it? The NZ First leader wasn&amp;rsquo;t there and yet he really was, after Luxon ruled him in at the start of the week. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know him,&amp;rdquo; professed Luxon of Peters, but will that wash? And what was the thinking behind the ruling-in, and why now. Annabelle Lee-Mather, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire tackle all of that, and pick the stars and the flops across other debates of the last week, including the powerbrokers clash on Newshub Nation, and the young voter and kaupapa Māori debates on TVNZ.</description>

Also on the list in a busy patch of pre-campaign activity: Labour launch a slogan and a week of law and order policy; National growls at potholes and offers KiwiSaver solutions to rental bonds; the Greens pledge to return stolen Māori land; the Dawn Raids report that made the apology ring hollow; and the major parties on course for their worst combined result since 2002.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Greens MP Chlöe Swarbrick joins Annabelle Lee Mather, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire to pick over the remains of election night in a special Sunday edition of Gone By Lunchtime. It&amp;rsquo;s the morning after a very successful election night for Labour, and a pretty good one for the Greens too – especially in Auckland Central, where Chlöe Swarbrick looks to have turned the electorate green for the first time.</description>

For 40 days and 40 nights (roughly, who&amp;rsquo;s counting) Alex Braae packed up his Bulletin in his old kit bag, threw it in the back of a Jucy van and toured the country to take the campaign pulse.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Annabelle Lee-Mather, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire gather around the giant orb of truth for the last time before polls close to assess the parties&amp;rsquo; campaigns, select the seats they&amp;rsquo;ll be drooling over, and put their pundit reputations on the line by predicting the final election outcome. We&amp;rsquo;re leaving together. But still it&amp;rsquo;s farewell. And maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll come back, to earth, who can tell? After a long, fascinating, long, intriguing and long campaign, the Gone By Lunchtime triumvirate size up the main parties&amp;rsquo; campaigns, nominate some of the seats they&amp;rsquo;ll be watching closely on election night, and foolishly issue predictions for the outcome.</description>

In 10 short days the skies will clear and for a few blessed hours the only hint of politics will be dogs outside polling stations on The Spinoff. Can Judith Collins close the gap?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Election debate season is finally upon us, and the Gone By Lunchtime trio are here to talk Tuesday night’s two big debates. The Hui’s livestreamed Waiariki candidate debate between Hannah Tamaki, Rawiri Waititi and Tamati Coffey, and TVNZ’s leaders’ debate between Judith Collins and Jacinda Ardern. One was raucous, robust, interesting and entertaining. The other was the leaders’ debate. There’s also, after weeks in the polling darkness, a new set of Colmar Brunton numbers to crunch, and a new multi-billion dollar fiscal hole has opened up.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ben Thomas never attends a party without a whakataukī in his pocket, and he does not disappoint in this week&amp;rsquo;s edition of Gone By Lunchtime. Along with Annabelle Lee-Mather and Toby Manhire, Ben sprinkles the wisdom on everything from the Māori Party policy to jettison &amp;ldquo;New Zealand&amp;rdquo; in favour of &amp;ldquo;Aotearoa&amp;rdquo; to the Labour Party policy to suffocate the tax debate in the 2020 campaign. Are National and Labour about to pull muscles in their scrap for the centre ground?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The 2020 election has risen, bleary eyed, from its slumber, and so have Annabelle, Ben and Toby. This week: Labour are promising a Matariki holiday, National are promising a health-driven response to meth addiction, and the Greens are trying to put the train back on the rails with the aid of several million apologies from James Shaw following the Green School debacle. Meanwhile, Winston Peters has found a path back to power: chugging ciggies, playing ping pong, and calling Jack Tame &amp;ldquo;James&amp;rdquo; a lot.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Join the the country&amp;rsquo;s most mellifluous political pod trio, the Alert Level Three, for another late night lockdown edition of Gone By Lunchtime.
Covid-19 continues to dominate the political agenda, with Jacinda Ardern and cabinet having extended level three for the Auckland region until the end of the weekend. Annabelle Lee-Mather, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire discuss the risks of lockdown fatigue, the new rules around masks, and the general sense of pre-election limbo.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas forget how to record a podcast over Zoom. Most elements of life under lockdown feel a little bit easier the second time around, but not recording an episode of Gone By Lunchtime. After being held up for over an hour by a confusing tech issue (Ben’s new phone doesn’t have a headphone jack), the renowned podcasting trio finally get stuck into the week’s political issues, of which there are a few.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas denounce new poll results that very slightly contradict their opinions. The scale of the summit for the National Party? A poll came out last week with Labour at 53%, and that was considered good news for Judith Collins and the Strong Team. With a month before advanced voting begins, Annabelle, Ben and Toby assess the state of the race, as well as the Act surge and Seymourmania, the valedictory speeches, the state of social liberal thinking in National, the battle for Auckland Central, the Māori seats (which are up for grabs), and the Burnham inquiry.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas dust off the bazookas scattered around New Zealand politics in this week&amp;rsquo;s Gone By Lunchtime. A new Newshub poll has put Judith Collins&amp;rsquo; National Party on 25.1%, Jacinda Ardern&amp;rsquo;s Labour on 60.9%, and many jaws on the floor. Gerry Brownlee has dismissed it as a &amp;ldquo;rogue poll&amp;rdquo;. Annabelle, Ben and Toby impersonate Nate Silver and assess the veracity of the thing, and ask: is this the result of the disarray in National or Ardern&amp;rsquo;s performance through the Covid crisis?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas on the Andrew Falloon scandal and its implications for a beleaguered National Party, a big weekend for Winston Peters and NZ First, and the chorus calling to charge arriving New Zealanders for their hotel isolation. Less than two months out from the election, the National Party remains bedevilled by controversy. Just a few days after she became leader, Judith Collins has successfully demanded the resignation of Andrew Falloon, dismissing one of the claims around the circumstances under which unsolicited pornographic images were sent by the first term MP to more than one young woman as &amp;ldquo;clearly a lie&amp;rdquo;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee-Mather and Ben Thomas reel at the announcement that Todd Muller has resigned as leader of the opposition. At 7.30am, just 53 days after he replaced Simon Bridges as leader of the National Party, Todd Muller announced his immediate resignation from the job. How did it come to this, and who is likely to emerge as the new leader, with less than 10 weeks to an election?</description>

After miserable poll results a challenge has been launched, with Todd Muller and probably Nikki Kaye angling to replace them as leader and deputy. The Gone By Lunchtime team offers a bold and, frankly, mind-blowing verdict on what will go down.</description>

Two months ago today, Spinoff Members and Verb Wellington cheerfully unveiled a new collaboration: a series of live events at the tremendous Meow bar. And, well, everyone knows what happened next. But the prospect of Danyl Mclauchlan talking to brilliant Stuff journalist Andrea Vance and the always insightful former chief-of-staff to the Labour leader turned director of Capital Government Relations Neale Jones was too appetising to abandon entirely.</description>

The Gone By Lunchtime trio look at the political and economic implications of the outbreak, weigh up Jacinda Ardern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t deport your problems&amp;rdquo; broadside at Scott Morrison in Sydney, and sigh painfully at Shane Jones&amp;rsquo;s latest round of conspicuous xenophobia. Oh, and a completely sober and non-histrionic assessment of rich people getting superannuation.</description>

How many of Bill English&amp;rsquo;s children were on the stage at the National launch? Is Bob your uncle? This and more in NZ&amp;rsquo;s top genealogy-based election podcast. Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee and Ben Thomas take a moment&amp;rsquo;s pause from gaping at the news headlines and social media hyperbole-parody to weigh up the latest chapter in a scandal-bedeviled campaign, as Winston Peters and his pension overpayment transmogrifies into a controversy about the no-surprises policy and anonymous tip-offs.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The very latest from the Ardernified election campaign, which has claimed yet another leader resignation. Fresh from having read all 140 pages of the Prefu just minutes after it was published, Annabelle Lee, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire rest their chins upon their fingers and analyse the issues of the moment. How is National coping with the Labour momentum under Jacinda Ardern? Is Labour&amp;rsquo;s position on tax a bit crap?</description>

With Ben Thomas marooned in Wellington, Duncan Greive pod-hops to join GBLT&amp;rsquo;s Toby Manhire and Annabelle Lee, but we do take a moment to call and sing him a song. With Metiria Turei having resigned, the Green Party is trying to start over, at once moving on and holding tight to its talismanic former co-leader.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Stop the election bus for just one second, please. Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee and Ben Thomas have new Gone By Lunchtime podcast and it will probably be overtaken by events any moment. Two third-term Green MPs have in effect jumped ship, saying Metiria Turei is not fit to lead the party. Will that torpedo the party, will it help or hinder a Labour Party re-energised by the Jacinda miracle?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Spinoff&amp;rsquo;s Gone By Lunchtime trio frantically gather their thoughts following the exit of Labour leader Andrew Little, who has been replaced by Jacinda Ardern, with Kelvin Davis as her deputy, with just over 50 days to an election. Within seconds of watching Jacinda Ardern conduct her first press conference as Labour leader, Toby Manhire, Annabelle Lee and Ben Thomas bundle into the studio to chat. The disastrous polls, Andrew Little&amp;rsquo;s bizarre decision to announce that he&amp;rsquo;d been thinking of resigning, the flurry of activity leading up to today&amp;rsquo;s caucus meeting, the Little legacy, the new pair&amp;rsquo;s debut peformance, the Winston factor, and what it means for those accursed billboards: all that, together with a rare insight into Ben Thomas&amp;rsquo;s erotic fantasies.</description>

And in open defiance of the schooling from professional broadcaster and Guy Williams, guest star of the last pod, the confectionery remains, with all its sonorous slurping and spluttering.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description By Jove, it&amp;rsquo;s only the hotly anticipated return of Gone By Lunchtime, the Spinoff&amp;rsquo;s epoch-defining politics pod with Annabelle Lee, Ben Thomas and Toby Manhire The Gone By Lunchtime podcast team has been roused from its slumber to fearlessly tackle the big political topics of the day/week/month/etc. Equipped with nothing but Lemsip, ginger beer, some decidedly odd tasting strawberry champagne flavoured Tim Tams and their cold-addled wit, Spinoff politics editor Toby Manhire, The Hui producer Annabelle Lee and Exceltium man Ben Thomas talk Brexit, Winston Peters, Paula Bennett under pressure over housing, Te Puea Marae, Simon Bridges, Hone Harawira&amp;rsquo;s return, the Shewan review of trust laws, and the Lindauer paintings on shower curtains.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Going off like a frog in a sock, the third edition of the Spinoff politics pod, featuring Annabelle Lee and Ben Thomas with Toby Manhire A brand new Gone By Lunchtime is here – unless you’re reading this some time in the future, in which case it will no longer be brand new. On the slate: John Key, the Panama Papers, and a U-turn on reviewing foreign trusts; the continuing struggles of NZ Labour Party as it approaches its 100th birthday; and Helen Clark’s campaign to become the secretary general of the United Nations: not as universally popular in New Zealand as some seem to think.</description>
