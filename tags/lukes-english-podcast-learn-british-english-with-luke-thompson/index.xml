        <description>Podcast Description This is not a full episode of the podcast - I&#39;m just letting you know that I&#39;m going away for a few weeks so there will be no podcasts for a little while. We&#39;re¬†getting away from it all for a few weeks. I probably won&#39;t be online much, perhaps not at all. A couple of places we&#39;re going to don&#39;t have any internet at all. It&#39;s going to be a bit of a digital detox.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode my brother James and I go for a game of mini golf in the local park, and then head to the pub for a pint of beer. While doing that we have a discussion about English history, life in the countryside vs life in the city, the London riots of 2011 and how James feels about being a guest on my podcast. I&#39;ve uploaded a lot of new episodes recently but that&#39;s going to stop soon when I go away on holiday for a few weeks.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this conversation Alex is in Edinburgh in Scotland and I&#39;m in Warwick in England. In the previous episode we talked about pub quizzes and how they&#39;re a common part of pub culture in the UK, so I thought we would play a kind of pub quiz with each other. The only problem is that neither of us are in a pub, but that doesn&#39;t matter - this is a podcast and you can use your imagination.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/5040190502/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode I talk to Alex Love in Edinburgh about his show, some details about the culture of pub quizzes in the UK and we go off on several quite instructive tangents about stag and hen parties, male strippers, The Smurfs and the anatomy of giant squid, which are large sea creatures with tentacles. That sounds quite random but it&#39;s not really. It&#39;s actually perfectly logical and it will all become clear as you listen to the conversation, and I think there&#39;s quite a lot to learn about British culture in this episode as you&#39;ll see.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode is a game show hosted by my Dad, with me as¬†the contestant. The aim of the game is to see how many words I know. My Dad designed this quiz for his students of journalism at the university where he works sometimes. The quiz is specifically designed to highlight what he considers to be common misuses and misunderstandings of words. His opinion is that journalists writing and presenting on television should use words in exactly the right way, even if many people use those¬†words to mean different things in general everyday use.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode of the podcast is all about telling anecdotes in English. Anecdotes are little stories about our experiences that we share while socialising. It&#39;s important to have a few anecdotes of your own and to know how to tell them properly. In this episode I&#39;m going to give you some advice for how to tell an anecdote and then you&#39;re going to listen to some true anecdotes told by members of my family that I recorded yesterday evening during dinner.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today on the podcast I&#39;m talking to Rob Ager from Liverpool, who is probably best known for his film analysis videos on YouTube in which he discusses classic Hollywood thrillers, sci-fi and action movies in quite astonishing levels of detail, often focusing on deep psychological and political themes and hidden messages that most viewers probably wouldn&#39;t even notice. His videos are carefully constructed documentaries, made for educational purposes and all of them feature a voice-over commentary by Rob in which he analyses the film and gives his observations.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hello and welcome to part 2 of this conversation with my friend Alex Love. If you haven&#39;t already heard part 1, I suggest you go back and listen to that. I&#39;ve divided this episode into two parts just because I thought it was a bit long and that it would be easier for you to deal with two slightly shorter episodes than one epically long one.

There will also be lots of fairly strong political points of view from me. Please listen to the whole thing and try to avoid knee jerk reactions. If you disagree with me please feel free to leave a comment because I am open to other points of view - but I encourage you to fully flesh out your opinion, don&amp;rsquo;t just give your knee-jerk reaction without backing it up with some evidence or justification.</description>

So there will be more Brexit &amp;amp; football in this episode and then it&amp;rsquo;ll be back to podcasting as usual. Oh and by the way there will be some swearing in this episode because I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing some comments from some angry people online and generally there has been quite a lot of swearing and kicking of furniture all across the country since Friday - especially yesterday while watching England get knocked out of the Euros.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is the final episode in this superhero series and simply put, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make fun of the latest X-Men movie. Now, you might not be into the superhero stuff and I totally understand, but let me give you a heads up about this episode. Basically, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the film and so I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in poking fun at it than talking about it seriously. So, that might make it more fun to listen to than the other superhero ones I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode features another¬†natural¬†conversation¬†with a native English speaker. This time I&amp;rsquo;m talking to my mate Carrick, who I&amp;rsquo;ve known for about 10 years now. He is a teacher who used to work in the same school as me, back in London. We have a few things in common, like the fact that we&amp;rsquo;ve both had a few strange travelling experiences as English teachers, including the time when he once attended a meeting in Germany that involved not only the usual business work but also the drinking of some very rare and expensive scotch whiskies, which meant that the meeting turned into a kind of musical party with guitar and flute playing, quite a lot of whisky drinking, a late night and then, unsurprisingly, a bit of a hangover the next day.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Why do people in meetings at work keep talking about &amp;ldquo;thinking outside the box&amp;rdquo;? Why does my boss say we need to &amp;ldquo;get all our ducks in a row&amp;rdquo;? And why does my project manager want to &amp;ldquo;touch base with me offline&amp;rdquo;? If it&amp;rsquo;s all a mystery to you, don&amp;rsquo;t worry - LEP is here to decode all this weird language. If you work in an office in an English-speaking country I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll have heard of &amp;lsquo;corporate jargon&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;management speak&amp;rsquo;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This year marks the 75th anniversary of The Battle of Britain, and since this is such a pivotal moment in British history, I thought it would be appropriate to cover it in some way in an episode of this podcast. Also, I was asked recently by a listener in the comments section of my website to talk about the story of the Battle of Britain, specifically the role of one particular group of Polish pilots known as Squadron #303.</description>

I gave you all the key information which the team has to share, I clarified some useful language that you&amp;rsquo;ll hear and then we listened to the first part of the bank robbery meeting, with our team of Amber, Paul and Sebastian.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description 100 episodes ago I recorded The Phrasal Verb Chronicles #1 - remember that? The point of that episode was to improvise a made-up story as a way of reviewing the first 50 phrasal verbs from my other podcast which is called A Phrasal Verb A Day. I had to just come up with a random story, and add in a load of phrasal verbs. Your task was to try and spot the phrasal verbs as I used them, while also following the story.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is a slightly rambling and unprepared episode which I made up as I went along, and in the end I talked about a page I found on MatadorNetwork.com called &amp;ldquo;11 Idioms Only Brits Understand&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that these are exclusively used by Brits, but nevertheless they are some pretty commonly used idioms, so I decided to talk to you about them in this episode. After that I ended up clicking on a few random YouTube videos, playing around with the cockney accent and listening to some music.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the last episode I attempted to explain ways that prepositions are used in English, and I failed because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared. I managed to get across the idea that prepositions are complicated because they&amp;rsquo;re used in combination with other words, and that you have to remember vocabulary in &amp;lsquo;chunks&amp;rsquo; but the idea was also to present you with some useful lists of preposition collocations. This time around I&amp;rsquo;ve done some more preparation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode I decided to teach you about prepositions! Yes! Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite words in English! (Sarcasm - most learners find them frustrating and confusing) However, the episode didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned and I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to deal with the subject as I had intended. Nevertheless, this episode contains some comments and information about prepositions, which works as an introduction to other episodes on the subject. Listen to this one before you listen episode 240, which deals with the subject in more depth.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On 18th September the people of Scotland will vote in a referendum to decide if Scotland should remain a part of the UK or become independent. If they vote &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and Scotland does become independent from the UK it would cause massive changes to the way the UK is organised. It would be the biggest change in UK history for hundreds of years. It could change everything - not only the lives of the Scottish people, but also the lives of the English, the Welsh and the people of Northern Ireland.</description>
