While doing that we have a discussion about English history, life in the countryside vs life in the city, the London riots of 2011 and how James feels about being a guest on my podcast. I've uploaded a lot of new episodes recently but that's going to stop soon when I go away on holiday for a few weeks.</description></item><item><title>375. The LEP Pub Quiz (with Alex Love) | Luke's ENGLISH Podcast - Learn British English with Luke Thompson</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5040190501/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2016 10:52:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5040190501/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this conversation Alex is in Edinburgh in Scotland and I'm in Warwick in England. In the previous episode we talked about pub quizzes and how they're a common part of pub culture in the UK, so I thought we would play a kind of pub quiz with each other. The only problem is that neither of us are in a pub, but that doesn't matter - this is a podcast and you can use your imagination.</description></item><item><title>374.

That sounds quite random but it's not really. It's actually perfectly logical and it will all become clear as you listen to the conversation, and I think there's quite a lot to learn about British culture in this episode as you'll see.</description></item><item><title>373.

The aim of the game is to see how many words I know. My Dad designed this quiz for his students of journalism at the university where he works sometimes. The quiz is specifically designed to highlight what he considers to be common misuses and misunderstandings of words. His opinion is that journalists writing and presenting on television should use words in exactly the right way, even if many people use those words to mean different things in general everyday use.</description></item><item><title>372.

His videos are carefully constructed documentaries, made for educational purposes and all of them feature a voice-over commentary by Rob in which he analyses the film and gives his observations.</description></item><item><title>369.

Mike is an old friend and colleague of mine, he&amp;rsquo;s originally from Scotland, although he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a particularly strong accent, and he has lived and worked in places all over the world. I&amp;rsquo;ve known him for about 13 years and he was one of the first people I ever worked with as a language teacher in Japan.</description></item><item><title>242. 11 Idioms Only Brits Understand (really?) | Luke's ENGLISH Podcast - Learn British English with Luke Thompson</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5040190639/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 11:36:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5040190639/</guid><description>Podcast Description This is a slightly rambling and unprepared episode which I made up as I went along, and in the end I talked about a page I found on MatadorNetwork.com called &amp;ldquo;11 Idioms Only Brits Understand&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that these are exclusively used by Brits, but nevertheless they are some pretty commonly used idioms, so I decided to talk to you about them in this episode. After that I ended up clicking on a few random YouTube videos, playing around with the cockney accent and listening to some music.</description></item><item><title>241.

I managed to get across the idea that prepositions are complicated because they&amp;rsquo;re used in combination with other words, and that you have to remember vocabulary in &amp;lsquo;chunks&amp;rsquo; but the idea was also to present you with some useful lists of preposition collocations. This time around I&amp;rsquo;ve done some more preparation.</description></item><item><title>238.

Yes! Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite words in English! (Sarcasm - most learners find them frustrating and confusing) However, the episode didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned and I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to deal with the subject as I had intended. Nevertheless, this episode contains some comments and information about prepositions, which works as an introduction to other episodes on the subject. Listen to this one before you listen episode 240, which deals with the subject in more depth.</description></item><item><title>237.
