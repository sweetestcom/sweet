        <description>Podcast Description The five-day workweek can feel as preordained as the number of minutes in an hour, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been the norm. Workers fought for a Monday-to-Friday schedule before it became standard in the U.S. in the 1930s. Since then, the nature of work has changed a lot, and now, workers are once again fighting for better conditions, says U.K.-based researcher Will Stronge.
In this episode, Stronge, who co-wrote the book Overtime: Why We Need a Shorter Working Week, discusses what has changed since the &amp;rsquo;30s and what a shorter workweek offers workers and organizations.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rage, fear, possessiveness, sadness or all of the above — we all experience romantic jealousy differently, but the common denominator is the feeling of that inner alarm bell going off telling you you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose your special someone.
When mishandled, feelings of jealousy can lead to anything from internal strife to actual violence. But cultivated correctly, it can also be a &amp;ldquo;beautiful opportunity&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;deepen our awareness of what we want, who we care about and who we are&amp;rdquo;.</description>

- A loss of only 3% of your body weight can meaningfully improve your health.
- Remember that your best weight is the one you reach when you live the healthiest life you can actually enjoy.</description>
