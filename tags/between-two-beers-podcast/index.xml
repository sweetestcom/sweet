        <description>Podcast Description Chloe&amp;rsquo;s story tests the limits of human endurance, and it may stretch your appreciation of what the human body and mind can achieve.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
She is probably the greatest ultra-marathon swimmer in history, and holds world records for the longest non-stop swim (124 km, 42 hours) and the most crossings of the English Channel (44).&amp;nbsp;
In this episode we talk about where her mental strength comes from, where her mind goes mid-swim - during the dark times, how she deals with shark danger, the time she nearly died 17 hours into a world record attempt, the time she had to abort a swim due to jellyfish stings, the mental anguish of swimming for 42 hours and what it does to the body and mind and so many other incredible stories.</description>
