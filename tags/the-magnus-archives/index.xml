"Hi everyone, Alex here.
Due to the recent police killing of Walter Wallace Jr., we have decided to delay public release of the Magnus Archives episode that was scheduled for today.
This is because - whilst it is not directly about race, racial violence, or death - it does deal with the police, wrongful imprisonment, and abuses of power which may hit particularly close to home this week.</description></item><item><title>MAG 184 - Like Ants | The Magnus Archives</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4111100073/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4111100073/</guid><description>Podcast Description Case ########-24

The Magnus Archives returns for its final season April 2nd 2020.
NOTE: This season was conceived long prior to the real world pandemic situation of March 2020, with many episodes written before governmental &amp;amp; societal responses. Some early episodes may feel remarkably, and uncomfortably, close to current events, but are the logical extension of and commentary on the events established at the end of Season 4.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Fears Competition Winner - Nox Mare | The Magnus Archives</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4111100106/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4111100106/</guid><description>Podcast Description As we build up to Season 5, this week's episode is the first of two winning stories from the Rusty Fears 3: Fearsome writing competition.
