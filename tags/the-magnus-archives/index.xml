Come join in as we go live at 11am GMT on the 12th December on Twitch.tv with 24 hours of videogames, board games and general fun and frolics. Yes, that’s right, I said 24 hours.
We’ve made a few changes to the show this year, one of which is that we’ll be raising money for three charities: Mind, Action Aid and the Black, African and Asian Therapy Network and anything we raise this year will be split evenly across all three of them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is a message from Alexander J Newall about the delay to today&#39;s episode of The Magnus Archives.
&#34;Hi everyone, Alex here.
Due to the recent police killing of Walter Wallace Jr., we have decided to delay public release of the Magnus Archives episode that was scheduled for today.
This is because - whilst it is not directly about race, racial violence, or death - it does deal with the police, wrongful imprisonment, and abuses of power which may hit particularly close to home this week.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Archivist and Martin reflect on their current situation...
The Magnus Archives returns for its final season April 2nd 2020.
NOTE: This season was conceived long prior to the real world pandemic situation of March 2020, with many episodes written before governmental &amp;amp; societal responses. Some early episodes may feel remarkably, and uncomfortably, close to current events, but are the logical extension of and commentary on the events established at the end of Season 4.</description>
