        <description>Podcast Description Last week, actor/comedian/writer Jonah Hill posted something on social media that went viral. Something about his body, and people&#39;s fascination with its changed shape. The substance of his post is about common sense, but for some, it&#39;s an entirely alien idea - that you should never comment on someone&amp;rsquo;s body. Ever.

The self-proclaimed Happiest Man On Earth - Eddie Jaku.&amp;nbsp; Eddie was 101 years old, a best-selling author, a holocaust survivor, and a German-born Jew whose parents were murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Eddie&amp;rsquo;s mission was to teach people not to hate. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond ironic then, that also yesterday, an Australian influencer dressed her family up in yellow stars, supposedly to represent the Star of David that Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear.</description>

The weekend&#39;s &#39;beach shaming&#39; speaks to how we&amp;rsquo;ve all enjoyed different privileges at different stages over the past 18 months, and how freedom has never been linear as we learn to live with Covid.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Before the recommencement of the 2020 NRL season, a number of safeguards were put in place.

Now, two players have lost their jobs for refusing the vaccine, and a subset of the league are furious. How do we feel about people&amp;rsquo;s jobs being conditional upon being vaccinated?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What is it like to be in self-imposed isolation with a bountiful stock of toilet paper and nowhere to go? Jessie Stephens knows because she&amp;rsquo;s in quarantine at the moment after returning from her holiday in Japan. She joins in remotely to discuss.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
and we unpack what happened with the COVID-infected GP, Chris Higgins.
Also, Married at First Sight&amp;rsquo;s Seb told wife Lizzie that she should up her fruit and veggie intake and that she&#39;s the &amp;ldquo;unhealthiest person&amp;rdquo; he&amp;rsquo;s ever met.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &amp;ldquo;I am not a girl and I am not a boy, so I must be something else.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s what 14 year old Audrey said when featured on ABC&amp;rsquo;s 4 Corners last Monday. In this episode, we discuss how much does the concept of gender dictates our lives? And why do people find gender fluidity to be so confronting?&amp;nbsp;
Also, Kate Middleton was recently featured in a podcast where she talked about the challenges of being a mother.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Australia has gone berserk on&amp;hellip; toilet paper! As fears of COVID-19 escalate, it seems like panic stockpiling has become the coping mechanism for many. But are we overreacting to this global pandemic or is it valid?&amp;nbsp;
Also, does a leader&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;indecent&amp;rsquo; behaviour speak to a wider character flaw? Boris Johnson&amp;rsquo;s fianc&amp;eacute; is pregnant but he won&#39;t say how many children he has in total. Like Bill Clinton and Barnaby Joyce, Boris makes personal choices that are considered to be morally questionable, so should this impact his eligibility for his job?</description>

Mutual orgasm is the HOLY GRAIL of sex but if it&amp;rsquo;s so important why is it so damn hard to achieve? Is there a secret to it? Is there no hope of it if a lot of women aren&amp;rsquo;t turned on by penetration?</description>

Also, last weekend, Mia&amp;rsquo;s daughter Coco went to her first underage music festival. During the event, 12 children were strip-searched including six who were allegedly found to be concealing drugs &amp;ldquo;internally&#34;.

And recently, the Queen banned Harry and Megan from using the word &amp;lsquo;ROYAL&amp;rsquo; in their branding which the couple are not happy about.</description>

That inspired writer Anne Helen Petersen to write an article on how unhealthy relationships with food can hide in plain sight. We ask, is it OK to tell someone that they have an eating disorder?
Also, today we answer a group therapy question posted by one of our listeners. Is it OK for teenage or tween girls to sleep in their male cousin&amp;rsquo;s room?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hey Outlouders!
It&amp;rsquo;s Holly dropping in your ears to tell you about our exciting dating podcast, Eligible.
We all know that dating apps can be deceiving. You&amp;rsquo;re swiping left and right at someone&amp;rsquo;s picture but you actually don&amp;rsquo;t know what the person is really like.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we came up with the idea of getting to know the person by hearing their voice before you see their picture.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mikhaela Peterson recently announced that her father, author Jordan Peterson, who is known for taking issue with political correctness and condemning feminism is recovering from addiction to tranquillisers and a near-death experience. So does the fact that Peterson&amp;rsquo;s life is not in order, negate all his advice?&amp;nbsp;
Also, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for him to propose&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pressure him&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; are phrases we hear women say in heterosexual relationships.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In a recent tweet, Bettina Arndt shared a poster from Griffith University&amp;rsquo;s dating manual which highlights a person&amp;rsquo;s right to say no to sex. In her words, she claimed that the manual encourages women to be &amp;ldquo;uncaring demanding bitches&amp;rdquo;. Despite her undisputed anti-feminist sentiment, the tweet made us ask, is Griffith University&amp;rsquo;s dating manual more partial towards women?
Also, vulvas and orgasms on Gwyneth Paltrow&amp;rsquo;s third episode of the Netflix series &amp;lsquo;the goop lab&amp;rsquo; has got us all wondering, is female sexuality witnessing a big cultural moment?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Not surprisingly, the ratings for this year&amp;rsquo;s Academy Awards were at an all-time low. Joaquin Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s veganism speech felt a tad bit preachy to some and we&amp;rsquo;re asking, why is it that almost every Oscar acceptance speech has to adopt some sort of a political or &amp;lsquo;woke&amp;rsquo; tone to make it memorable?
Also, more than 90 women have accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. Donna Rotunno is Harvey&amp;rsquo;s female defense lawyer and her interview with the New York Times&#39;s Meghan Toohey has got everyone (including us) talking.</description>

So we&amp;rsquo;re wondering, what is the &amp;ldquo;annoying woman syndrome&amp;rdquo; and does Taylor Swift have it?
Also, do you use &amp;ldquo;as previously discussed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m balancing a lot this week&amp;rdquo; when emailing someone at work? If so, you could be considered passive aggressive but do we really know what these phrases mean?</description>

Three years ago, nearly 300 people signed a statement to the Australian parliament asking for Indigenous voices be heard in our government, the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</description>

The conditions have been described as &amp;ldquo;apocalyptic&amp;rdquo; and likened to &amp;ldquo;an atomic bomb&amp;rdquo; as fires continue to burn in every state and territory in the country.
On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve tens of thousands of Australians found themselves trapped by fire with no power or mobile phone service. We speak to Mamamia&amp;rsquo;s Editor, Clare Stephens, who was one of them.</description>

What will this bill look like in the real world and what does it mean for non-religious people?
And, is it really that sad to be spending Christmas alone? Rachel joins today&amp;rsquo;s show and asks why pity is the response she gets when she tells people she&amp;rsquo;ll be alone at Christmas.</description>

And Christmas is becoming increasingly problematic&amp;hellip; at least according to Jessie. After a year that&amp;rsquo;s been all about cancel culture, sustainability, introversion and self care, is Christmas on the brink of cancellation?</description>

We unpack the TV interview that will no doubt go down in history.&amp;nbsp;

In his new memoir, American music producer and DJ Moby wrote that he and actress Natalie Portman briefly dated when she was 20 and he was 33.The thing is, Portman denies the claims, saying that Moby was &amp;ldquo;a much older man being creepy with me when I had just graduated from high school.&amp;rdquo; Portman also says she was 18 at the time, not 20.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Did you wear make up to school? A girl&amp;rsquo;s school in Victoria has made headlines after students were made to remove eyelash extensions before their school photos.

Yvie Jones&amp;rsquo; protest at a weigh in on I&amp;rsquo;m a Celebrity has gone viral for all the right reasons.

        <description>Podcast Description Bradley Cooper admitted to Oprah this week that he was embarrassed that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been nominated for Best Director by the Oscars. Which got us thinking, when it comes to things like failure, is embarrassment the feeling we are most afraid of?
Last week, recently elected 29-year-old US politician Alexandria Ocarsio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine. An &#39;old school&#39; female politician would NEVER have done this for fear of being seen as shallow and too &#39;female&#39;.</description>

Because it seems that in every relationship, there&amp;rsquo;s a person who wants to moan and a person who wants to offer solutions. So should a conversation have a goal?</description>

The O-shot is a procedure which &amp;ldquo;takes blood from the patient&amp;rsquo;s arm, spins it in a centrifuge to &amp;ldquo;activate&amp;rdquo; it and produce &amp;ldquo;high quality&amp;rdquo; Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP).&#34;&amp;nbsp; This is then injected into the area below the urethra and into the vaginal wall to help you achieve orgasm.&amp;nbsp; And it will set you back $1700. But is not having an orgasm really something to be embarrassed about or should we all stop putting so much pressure on ourselves?</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve ended in the middle of an earth-shifting #metoo movement, which has seen powerful men stripped of their untouchable status along with their honours and sometimes, their livelihoods.
Rachel and Holly are joined by the face of our local #metoo movement, journalist, activist and feminist Tracey Spicer to talk about how 2017 became the year the world woke up to sexual harrasment.</description>

What followed was possibly even more controversial - a non-binding postal vote. But, we got there in the end and just this month the first same sex couple got married.</description>

Melania Trump has moved into the White House, where she&#39;s about to find out that the reno restrictions are tougher than The Block.

So when commentator&amp;nbsp;Yassmin Abdel-Magid suggested that Australians should instead spare a thought for those on Manus Island and in Syria, it went down like a lead balloon. But isn&#39;t this the freedom of speech that our ANZAC soldiers fought for? What&amp;rsquo;s the right amount of Maternity leave to take? Anne-Marie Slaughter, former advisor to Hillary Clinton, says 12 months of maternity leave is too long and it will damage your career.</description>

If you give birth in a Cyclone should you name the baby after the Cyclone during which you birthed?

        <description>Podcast Description Have you been called a &#34;difficult&#34; woman? This week Pia Miller, Home and Away actress was in Elle magazine, described as exhibiting a &amp;ldquo;zealous level of control&amp;rdquo;. Is the criticism justified? Or is a bossy woman inevitably a bitch? Also, is wolf whistling the worst, the three million dollar wedding that ended up in court, and why International Happiness Day is a crock.&amp;nbsp;Plus, if you hate your body, and you aren&amp;rsquo;t convinced by the &amp;ldquo;body positivity movement&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to embrace &#34;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Cartoonist Bill Leak died. &amp;nbsp;But rather than celebrating his life, many of his critics have vocally celebrated his death. Should we always respect someone in death, even if we didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with them? &amp;nbsp;The Girls episode that blew open a conversation many of us had been too afraid to have. Is there such thing as casual sexual assault? Plus - have you noticed anything about RomComs of late? There&amp;rsquo;s an argument that modern dating has changed the &amp;lsquo;happily ever after&amp;rsquo; narrative for movies in Hollywood.</description>

Seriously, though. We talk about Emma Watson&#39;s Vanity Fair cover. There&#39;s a new move for equality for pedestrian crossing symbols. Have you heard of The Alpha Wife? They&#39;re ruining marriages. Should you fake an orgasm or is that just rewarding bad behaviour?

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s the thinking woman&#39;s guilty pleasure but do we need to butt out on the Canadian Prime Minister&#39;s pants policy? The world&#39;s biggest Oscars stuff up revealed one hero who we need in our lives. Is it ever ok to say you don&#39;t want a man to babysit your child? Is the term &#39;basic bitch&#39; offensive or just funny? The new penalty rates decision brings some workplace tension, but it&#39;s not the worst thing we&#39;ve ever heard in the workplace.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Is Tziporah Malkah the most interesting woman on TV right now? She has some stiff competition because this week the NSW Minister for Women admitted she&#39;s pro-life, meteorologists said we need to dump the term &#39;weather girls&#39;, Melania Trump continued to look utterly despondent, and there was a crazy ex-girlfriend on Married At First Sight. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not all bad news though; we talk the AFL women&#39;s launch, and&amp;nbsp;the kitchen trick that will transform your cheap wine into expensive tasting plonk.</description>

Put down Pokemon Go for a minute, and switch Gilmore Girls off the TV, because 2016 was a 90&#39;s nostalgia fest. From Full House, to the Spice Girls reunion, why are we suddenly craving the delights of the nineties? It&#39;s psychology, of course, and social media. But enjoy it while it lasts&amp;nbsp;because there&#39;s a theory that mass nostalgia, the way we&#39;ve seen it emerge this year, will never happen again.</description>

Sofia Vergara is locked in a legal battle over her eggs&amp;nbsp;and it&#39;s not very Modern Family.

Is she really &amp;lsquo;princess material&amp;rsquo;? And more to the point, should she want to be? And in case you missed it, boobs are now out of fashion. Vogue said so.

        <description>Podcast Description Melbourne Cup may be over, but online gawking at drunk women at the races is not. Why? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we stopped snapping tipsy&amp;nbsp;race-goers as if they&amp;rsquo;re wild animals in a nature&amp;nbsp;documentary? Victoria&#39;s Secret have offered us something #diverse by having a model with stretch marks. The only problem is you can&#39;t see them. Plus, should animal owners refer to themselves as their pets&#39; &amp;ldquo;mum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;dad&amp;rsquo;? Jessie thinks yes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Are you a nasty woman? We hope so. How this insult has become a badge of honor for women. Behind every successful man is a woman. So when a marriage breaks down, who ends up worse off? Taylor Swift got groped on the arse by a man and her response was exactly what we all need. Australias most Instagram famous toddler, Sonny Blake, isn&amp;rsquo;t just cute. Some say he is changing the perception of modern fatherhood.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Do you brunch out without a care for the cost? Are you living a lavish life of daily takeaway lattes? No wonder you can&amp;rsquo;t buy a house. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s an intergenerational war over housing affordability, and things get uglier than an overripe avocado. Australians are grieving over the tragic story of the Davidson deaths. What does it say about family violence, mental health and community? Is Melania Trump a prisoner who is sending us signals with her eyelashes?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After Donald Trump dismissed sexist comments as &#39;locker room&#39; banter, we asked some male athletes what they actually talk about in locker rooms. How could a joyous pregnancy announcement possible spark a backlash? And do you drink to celebrate, commiserate, for stress reasons, because you&#39;re happy, because the kids have gone to bed, or because they haven&#39;t yet? Problem drinking has a new face; women. But are our support services keeping up?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The terrible, no good response to Kim Kardashian&#39;s Paris hold up. What does it say about our approach to women who don&#39;t play by the rules? Australian Story this week was an ethical dilemma; should a couple with Down Syndrome get to have a baby? Just when we got used to side boob, side vag has appeared to give us all a stress rash, and would you sit on a park bench and talk to strangers?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s fine, he&#39;s a feminist, we checked. This week Mia is wearing her Hillary T-shirt, and glowing, so we unpack the top moments from the US presidential debate. At home, there was a small, but important shift in the way we view red carpets. Is fit-shaming the new fat-shaming? Shane Warne: loveable larrakin or creepy uncle? Is it a bit wrong that Pauline Hanson&#39;s face is on a dog poo bag?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Pass the tissues, and put your hand over your mouth. Hillary Clinton has pneumonia. What does this mean for the woman who could be president? We&#39;ve had a gutful of this same-sex marriage plebiscite but if we&#39;re going to spend $185 million on asking Australians what they think, should we throw a few other questions in too? The no-pants fashion moment that we can&#39;t stop looking at, why the Cleo Bachelor of the Year sparked another big idea from Mia.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The new Lamb ad is a big meaty display of diversity but there&#39;s one thing we noticed. Lena Dunham forced to apologise for racism; is outrage culture out of control? The best part of the AFL women&#39;s game had nothing to do with what happened on the field. Should taxpayers stop funding IVF in women who are trying to have babies much later in life?&amp;nbsp;Can we please talk about Kyly Clarke&#39;s Baby Baptism?</description>

A dating expert has written a guide on how men can interrupt women with headphones in order to&amp;nbsp;crack onto them. What&#39;s going on with the same-sex marriage plebiscite? And Ask Bossy has advice for a racist. Plus, remember when Book Week was all about the books? HA. HAHAHAHAHA. No, seriously. In a week of blackfaced kids dressed up as sports stars, we ask: are the librarians out there OK?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week, the furniture is shifting on Mamamia Out Loud. It could be the very heated debate that flares around Mia&#39;s opinion&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;nude selfies. It could be the warmth&amp;nbsp;rising from the red faces about the celebrity names we&#39;ve been saying incorrectly all these years. It could be the fury around the Salim Mehajer video that the nation is obsessed with this week. Or it could be a wave of relief at us finally finding a parenting book that validates our laziness.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The census was a shemozzle. But among the outcry, won&#39;t someone think of the statisticians? Women athletes rule the Olympics, but the good-looking ones rule more. Is it&amp;nbsp;ok to objectify male Olympians or is it a double standard? Are you a wolf or a poodle? It&#39;s the perfect way&amp;nbsp;to categorise your life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ask Bossy has some real talk for anyone stuck in a job they hate.

        <description>Podcast Description We unpack the Sonia Kruger racism debate and wonder: what does free speech entail, exactly? And why do celebrity opinions make the news?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is &amp;ldquo;cultural appropriation&amp;rdquo; and does it mean we all need to stop wearing bindi&amp;rsquo;s and kimonos? The pressure on women to have a &#34;natural&#34; birth is absurd. The emoji change that&#39;s well overdue, the cult of fitness, the sperm of Mick Jagger, the joy of a sultana cake, and why you should go and see Tarzan and Ghostbusters this weekend.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with calling women&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;hysterical&amp;rdquo;? It&#39;s called Gaslighting and it&#39;s worth knowing about. Do you believe in love? Do you believe in Hiddleswift? You won&amp;rsquo;t after you hear about&amp;nbsp;PRomance. Jen Aniston has been lining magazine pages for 16 years but now she&amp;rsquo;s fed up, and written a manifesto to prove it.

And is it wrong to stockpile limited edition icecreams? For Jamila, it feels so right.
