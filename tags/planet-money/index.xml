        <description>Podcast Description Remember pagers? They were huge in the 80s — these little devices that could receive short messages. Sir Mix-A-Lot even had a song about them! But then cell phones came along, and pagers more or less became obsolete.
Except there&amp;rsquo;s one group of people who still carry pagers: medical doctors. At a surprisingly large number of hospitals, the pager remains the backbone of communication. Need to ask a doctor a question?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today on the show, we have two episodes from our daily podcast, The Indicator, about things we spend a lot of time thinking about this time of year: food and drink. First up, we explore how changes in economic conditions led to one of the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s iconic (and affordable) staple foods becoming a luxury.
Then, the story of one Indigenous woman whose small business went head-to-head with Coca-Cola over a trademark dispute.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Would you say that you and your family are better off or worse off, financially, than you were a year ago? Do you think in 12 months we&amp;rsquo;ll have good times, financially, or bad? Generally speaking, do you think now is a good time or a bad time to buy a house?
These are the kinds of questions baked into the Consumer Sentiment Index. And while the economy has been humming along surprisingly well lately, sentiment has stayed surprisingly low.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the state of Oregon, there is a glut of grass. A wealth of weed. A crisis of chronic. And, jokes aside, it&amp;rsquo;s a real problem for people who work in the cannabis industry like Matt Ochoa. Ochoa runs the Jefferson Packing House in Medford, Oregon, which provides marijuana growers with services like drying, trimming and packing their product. He has seen literal tons of usable weed being left in marijuana fields all over the state of Oregon.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It&amp;rsquo;s also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.
First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Some of the most influential and beloved novels of the last few years have been about money, finance, and the global economy. Some overtly so, others more subtly. It got to the point where we just had to call up the authors to find out more: What brought them into this world? What did they learn? How were they thinking about economics when they wrote these beautiful books? Today on the show: we get to the bottom of it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description China&amp;rsquo;s economic growth for the past few decades has been extraordinary. And much of that growth was fueled by real estate – it was like this miraculous economic engine for the country. But recently, that engine seems to have stopped working. And that has raised all kinds of questions not just for China but also for the global economy. Today on the show, we look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside China&amp;rsquo;s real estate market.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When best-selling thriller writer Douglas Preston began playing around with OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s new chatbot, ChatGPT, he was, at first, impressed. But then he realized how much in-depth knowledge GPT had of the books he had written. When prompted, it supplied detailed plot summaries and descriptions of even minor characters. He was convinced it could only pull that off if it had read his books.
Large language models, the kind of artificial intelligence underlying programs like ChatGPT, do not come into the world fully formed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The world of economics has these two different sides. One one side, there are the economists in their cozy armchairs and dusty libraries, high up in their ivory towers. On the other, there&amp;rsquo;s the messy world we&amp;rsquo;re all living in, where those economics are actually playing out. Sometimes, researchers will write about something that they themselves have never actually experienced. Sure, they&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it, theorized, come up with smart analyses&amp;hellip;but that&amp;rsquo;s not the same as getting out of that armchair and into the real world.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3020500009/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description When Lina Khan was in law school back in 2017, she wrote a law review article called &amp;lsquo;Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Antitrust Paradox,&amp;rsquo; that went kinda viral in policy circles. In it, she argued that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. was behind the times. For decades, regulators had focused narrowly on consumer welfare, and they&amp;rsquo;d bring companies to court only when they thought consumers were being harmed by things like rising prices.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Earlier this fall, the Federal Trade Commission filed a high-stakes lawsuit against Amazon.
In that suit, the FTC claims Amazon is a monopoly, and it accuses the company of using anti-competitive tactics to hold onto its market power. It&amp;rsquo;s a big case, with implications for consumers and businesses and digital marketplaces, and for antitrust law itself. That is the highly important but somewhat obscure body of law that deals with competition and big business.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You might expect to find economic concepts in the pages of an economics textbook. But you know where you can really see a lot of economic concepts in action? Buffets.
Here at Planet Money we believe there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of economics going on at the all-you-eat buffet, tucked in between the mountains of brisket and troughs of mashed potatoes. From classic concepts like adverse selection, sunk costs, diminishing marginal returns, to more exotic economic mysteries, like the flat rate pricing bias.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Right now, a lot of school districts across the country are making a pretty giant change to the way public education usually works. Facing teacher shortages and struggling to fill vacant spots, they are finding a new recruitment tool: the four-day school week.
Those districts are saying to teachers, &amp;ldquo;You can have three-day weekends all the time, and we won&amp;rsquo;t cut your pay.&amp;rdquo; As of this fall, around 900 school districts – that&amp;rsquo;s about 7% of all districts in the U.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Union membership in the U.S. has been declining for decades. But, in 2022, support for unions among Americans was the highest it&amp;rsquo;s been in decades. This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When someone says &amp;ldquo;the economy is doing well&amp;rdquo;—what does that even mean? Like, for workers, for employers, for the country as a whole? According to what calculation? How do you put a number on it?
The world of economics is filled with all sorts of &amp;ldquo;measuring sticks.&amp;rdquo; GDP. Inflation. Unemployment. Consumer sentiment. Over time, all kinds of government agencies, universities and private companies have come up with different ways to measure facets of the economy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Note: There is swearing in this episode.
In 2017, The University of Minnesota asked comedian Maria Bamford to give their commencement speech. But the University may not have known what it was in for. In her speech, Bamford told the crowd of graduates how much the university offered to pay her (nothing), her counteroffer ($20,000), and the amount they settled on ($10,000), which (after taxes and fees, etc.) she gave away to students in the audience to pay down their student loans.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3020500016/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Prices go up. Occasionally, prices go down. But for 70 years, the price of a bottle of Coca-Cola didn&amp;rsquo;t change. From 1886 until the late 1950s, a bottle of coke cost just a nickel.
On today&amp;rsquo;s show, we find out why. The answer includes a half a million vending machines, a 7.5 cent coin, and a company president who just wanted to get a couple of lawyers out of his office.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 2007, Uruguay had a massive problem with no obvious fix. The economy of this country of 3.5 million people was growing, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough energy to power all that growth.
Ramón Méndez Galain was, at the time, a particle physicist, but he wanted to apply his scientific mind to this issue. He started researching different energy sources and eventually wrote up a plan for how Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s power grid could transition to renewable energy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When contract negotiations between Alaska Airlines and their flight attendants&amp;rsquo; union broke down in 1993, the union had a choice to make.
The union — The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA — knew that if they chose to strike, Alaska Airlines could use a plan. While Alaska Airlines technically couldn&amp;rsquo;t fire someone on strike, they could permanently replace the striking flight attendants with new workers. Essentially, if the union went on strike, they could risk thousands of people&amp;rsquo;s jobs.</description>

Why is September historically the worst month for the stock market?

        <description>Podcast Description There seems to be headlines about floods, wildfires, or hurricanes every week. Scientists say this might be the new normal — that climate change is making natural disasters more and more common.
Tatyana Deryugina is a leading expert on the economics of natural disasters — how we respond to them, how they affect the economy, and how they change our lives. And back when Tatyana first started researching natural disasters she realized that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot we don&amp;rsquo;t know about their long-term economic consequences.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Nobel-prize winning economist Simon Kuznets once analyzed the world&amp;rsquo;s economies this way — he said there are four kinds of countries: developed, underdeveloped, Japan&amp;hellip; and Argentina.
If you want to understand what happens when inflation really goes off the rails, go to Argentina. Annual inflation there, over the past year, was 124 percent. Argentina&amp;rsquo;s currency, the peso, is collapsing, its poverty rate is above 40 percent, and the country may be on the verge of electing a far right Libertarian president who promises to replace the peso with the dollar.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When a group of amateur investors rallied around the stock for GameStop back in 2021, the story blew up the internet. News outlets around the world, including us here at Planet Money, rushed in to explain why the stock for this retail video game company was suddenly skyrocketing, at times by as much as 1700% in value, and what that meant for the rest of us.
When movie producer Aaron Ryder saw the GameStop story — an army of scrappy underdogs, banding together to strike back against a financial system they felt was rigged against them — he knew it had the makings for a great movie.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Erin Plante is a private detective who specializes in chasing down stolen cryptocurrency. In March of 2022, she got the biggest assignment of her career: Hackers had broken into an online game called Axie Infinity and made off with over $600 million worth of digital money.
It was the largest crypto heist in history. And now it was Erin&amp;rsquo;s job to find that money and get it back. Erin&amp;rsquo;s investigation would lead her to face off against some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most formidable digital money launderers, whose actions would soon raise alarms at the highest levels of government — even threaten the nuclear security of the entire planet.</description>

But many of the stories emerging from the country paint a clear picture: the second largest economy in the world is struggling.
Today, our friends at The Indicator share some of their recent reporting on China. First up, it&amp;rsquo;s a special edition of the Beigie Awards focused entirely on China.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When economists and policymakers talk about getting inflation under control, there&amp;rsquo;s an assumption they often make: bringing inflation down will probably result in some degree of layoffs and job loss. But that is not the way things have played out since inflation spiked last year. Instead, so far, inflation has come down, and unemployment has stayed low.
So where does the idea of this tradeoff – between inflation and unemployment – come from?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1981, photographer Lynn Goldsmith took a portrait of the musician Prince. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty standard headshot — it&amp;rsquo;s in black-and-white, and Prince is staring down the camera lens.
This was early in his career, when he was still building the pop icon reputation he would have today. And in 1984, shortly after Prince had released Purple Rain, he was chosen to grace the cover of Vanity Fair. The magazine commissioned pop culture icon Andy Warhol to make a portrait of Prince for the cover.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Back in the 1990s, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar was in his office in New Delhi when he came across a puzzling story in the newspaper. Some university scientists in the U.S. had apparently filed a patent for using turmeric to help heal wounds. Mashelkar was shocked, because he knew that using turmeric that way was a well known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. And he knew that patents are for brand new inventions.</description>

But first, there&amp;rsquo;s one final skill to impart: the pitch. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing our job as a half-baked parody of a business school if we didn&amp;rsquo;t leave you with the confidence and opportunity to stand in front of an investor and ask for money.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Across Hollywood right now, writers and actors are picketing in front of studio lots. They&amp;rsquo;re walking back and forth, holding up signs demanding concessions on things like pay, how many writers work on projects, and the use of AI in TV and movies.
But, on some of these lots, there are these strange alternate entrances where there are no picketers. Here drivers can come and go as they please without ever encountering any sign of a strike.</description>

Every single worker in the European Union is guaranteed four weeks of paid vacation. No matter how long they&amp;rsquo;ve been at a company. No matter how low paying the job is. Vacation is a right.
In fact, all but one of the richest countries in the world guarantees paid vacation, except: the U.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This summer, the Supreme Court struck down Biden&amp;rsquo;s plan to forgive student loan debt for millions of borrowers. Except, on the same day Biden first announced that plan, he also unveiled another, the SAVE plan. And though SAVE sounded less significant than Biden&amp;rsquo;s big forgiveness pledge, it&amp;rsquo;s still alive and could erase even more student debt.
SAVE is officially a loan repayment plan. But through a few seemingly minor yet powerful provisions, many more low-income borrowers will end up paying little or nothing until, eventually, their loans will be forgiven.</description>

But, since this is Planet Money Summer School and we want to set your business on the path to riches, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about how to use tech to dream big.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Predicting the future of the economy is always a dicey proposition. That is especially true after more than three years of pandemic-related economic weirdness. No one quite knows what will happen next.
Will the Fed be able to pull off a soft landing and bring down inflation without causing either a recession or a big jump in unemployment? Or will we end up with a hard landing, in which inflation comes down, but at the price of the country&amp;rsquo;s economic health?</description>

Both have conducted blockbuster research into how to make people more honest, research we&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted on Planet Money. The two worked together on a paper about how to &amp;ldquo;nudge&amp;rdquo; people to be more honest on things like forms or tax returns. Their trick: move the location where people attest that they have filled in a form honestly from the bottom of the form to the top.</description>

Inside the simple act of accounting is a revolutionary way of thinking not just about a business, but about the world. A universe where all the forces are in balance. Accounting gives you a sixth sense–one that can help you determine whether your business will survive or fail.</description>

But then there are the horror stories like Greg Selden&amp;rsquo;s. He tried to sue AirBnB for racial discrimination while using their site. But he had basically signed away his ability to sue AirBnB when he made an account.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When it comes to big questions about the economy, we&amp;rsquo;re still kind of in the dark ages. Why do some economies grow so much faster than others? How long is the next recession going to last? How do we stop inflation without wrecking the rest of the economy? These questions are the domain of macroeconomics. But even some macroeconomists themselves admit: While we have many theories about how the economy works, we have very few satisfying answers.</description>

First, as we start to understand post-affirmative action America, we look to a natural experiment 25 years ago, when California ended the practice in public universities. It reshaped the makeup of the universities almost instantly. We find out what happened in the decades that followed.
Then, we ask, why does it cost so much for America to build big things, like subways. Compared to other wealthy nations, the costs of infrastructure projects in the U.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The shocks of the pandemic economy gave us a bunch of enormous natural experiments, which helped to prove or disprove conventional economic thinking.
Take, for example, the bullwhip effect, the idea that the further away from the customer you are in the supply chain, the more volatile your orders are likely to be. This theory played out at an enormous scale, in the pandemic. Consumers and companies overreacted to the risk of shortages by ordering more products and hoarding them, causing massive shifts in the supply chain – just like the theory says.</description>

But it&amp;rsquo;s not just strangers on the street who are fascinated by twins. Scientists have been studying twins since the 1800s, trying to get at one of humanity&amp;rsquo;s biggest questions: How much of what we do and how we are is encoded in our genes?</description>

Today on the show, we&amp;rsquo;re airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator.

But they were rare. In part because randomized trials – in which you recruit two statistically identical groups, choose one of them to get a treatment, and then compare what happens to each group – are expensive, and they take a lot of time.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description (Note: This episode originally ran back in 2022.)
This past weekend, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse had the second largest domestic opening of 2023, netting (or should we say webbing?) over $120 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada. But the story leading up to this latest Spider-Man movie has been its own epic saga.
When Marvel licensed the Spider-Man film rights to Sony Pictures in the 1990s, the deal made sense — Marvel didn&amp;rsquo;t make movies yet, and their business was mainly about making comic books and toys.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s the thrilling conclusion to our three-part series on AI — the world premiere of the first episode of Planet Money written by AI. In Part 1 of this series, we taught AI how to write an original Planet Money script by feeding it real research and interviews. In Part 2, we used AI to clone the voice of our former colleague Robert Smith.
Now, we&amp;rsquo;ve put everything together into a 15-minute Planet Money episode.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Part 1 of this series, AI proved that it could use real research and real interviews to write an original script for an episode of Planet Money.
Our next task was to teach the computer how to sound like us. How to read that script aloud like a Planet Money host.
On today&amp;rsquo;s show, we explore the world of AI-generated voices, which have become so lifelike in recent years that they can credibly imitate specific people.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We used to think some jobs were safe from automation. Though machines have transformed industries like agriculture and manufacturing, the conventional wisdom was that they could never perform what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;knowledge work.&amp;rdquo; That the robots could never replace lawyers or accountants — or journalists, like us.
Well, ever since the release of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, it feels like no job is safe. AI can now write essays, generate computer code, and even pass the bar exam.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For the last four decades, technology has been mostly a force for greater inequality and a shrinking middle class. But new empirical evidence suggests that the age of AI could be different. We speak to MIT&amp;rsquo;s David Autor, one of the greatest labor economists in the world, who envisions a future where we use AI to make a wider array of workers much better at a whole range of jobs and help rebuild the middle class.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Economists say that inflation is just too much money chasing too few goods.
But something else can make inflation stick around.
If you think of the 1970s, the last time the U.S. had really high sustained inflation, a big concern was rising wages. Prices for goods and services were high. Workers expected prices to be even higher next year, so they asked for pay raises to keep up. But then companies had to raise their prices more.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description (Note: this episode originally ran in 2019.)
In the 1800s, catching your train on time was no easy feat. Every town had its own &amp;ldquo;local time,&amp;rdquo; based on the position of the sun in the sky. There were 23 local times in Indiana. 38 in Michigan. Sometimes the time changed every few minutes. This created tons of confusion, and a few train crashes. But eventually, a high school principal, a scientist, and a railroad bureaucrat did something about it.</description>

But when it came time to sell it, he ran into a problem: his neighbor had a goat pen, and about half of it crossed over onto his property. Burt asked the goats&amp;rsquo; owner to move the pen, but when neighborly persuasion failed to get the job done, he changed his strategy. He sued her.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? An astronaut, a doctor or maybe a famous athlete? Today one of the most popular responses to that question is influencer – content creators who grow their following on Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube and monetize that content to make it their full-time job.
In a lot of ways influencing can seem like the dream job - the filters, the followers, the free stuff.</description>

Erika is Black–and being a Black financial advisor at a big bank is relatively uncommon. Banking was one of the last white collar industries to really hire Black employees.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Note: This episode originally aired in September, 2014.
Zoos follow a fundamental principle: You can&amp;rsquo;t sell or buy the animals. It&amp;rsquo;s unethical and illegal to put a price tag on an elephant&amp;rsquo;s head. But money is really useful — it lets you know who wants something and how much they want it. It lets you get rid of things you don&amp;rsquo;t need and acquire things that you do need.</description>

The buyer would call different car builders in their town and show them the blueprints. And the builders might say, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I can build you that car based on this blueprint.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This past January, researchers uncovered that Black taxpayers are three to five times as likely to be audited as everyone else. One likely reason for this is that the IRS disproportionately audits lower-income earners who claim a tax benefit called the earned income tax credit. And this, says law professor Dorothy Brown, is just one example of the many ways that race is woven through our tax system, its history, and its enforcement.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Right now, the economy is running hot. Inflation is high, and central banks are pushing up interest rates to fight it. But before the pandemic, economies around the world were stuck in a different rut: low inflation, low interest rates, low growth. In 2013, Larry Summers unearthed an old term from the Great Depression to explain why the economy was in this rut: secular stagnation. The theory resonated with Olivier Blanchard, another leading scholar, because he had made similar observations himself.</description>

Today, we&amp;rsquo;re bringing you two episodes of our daily show The Indicator that focus on the bond market.
The market for U.S. treasury bonds is generally safe, predictable and pretty boring. Recently, though, it&amp;rsquo;s been anything but. We look into the fluctuations in bond prices and the yield curve (one of our favorite indicators) to try to help us understand where the economy stands right now.</description>

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have promised reports on what went wrong with bank oversight. And judging by our inbox, you, our listeners, have a lot of lingering questions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Puerto Rico&amp;rsquo;s beaches are an integral part of life on the island, and by law, they&amp;rsquo;re one of the few places that are truly public. In practice, the sandy stretch of land where the water meets the shore is one of the island&amp;rsquo;s most contested spaces.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re featuring an episode of the podcast La Brega from WNYC Studios and Futuro Studios, a show about Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican experience.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the first half of March, three banks - Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate - all had relatively classic bank runs and collapsed. Which sparked some major banking stress. As a result, the Federal Reserve got a lot of requests to use one of its oldest and most important tools for soothing such troubles: the discount window.
The discount window is like a safety net for banks.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Earlier this month, we saw the largest bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. For many of us, seeing Silicon Valley Bank&amp;rsquo;s meltdown brought us right back to that time 15 years ago, at the beginning of what would become the Great Recession. In early 2009, one or two banks were failing every week. That&amp;rsquo;s when Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt went inside one of those banks: the Bank of Clark County, in Washington State.</description>

Everyone onboard thinks this is it, and then the plane levels out and everything is fine. For about 72 hours, people and companies that had deposited millions of dollars at the Silicon Valley Bank — many of whom were in the tech industry — thought they had lost absolutely everything to a bank collapse.
Two weeks later, the situation at Silicon Valley Bank has leveled off.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in America, the bank of choice for tech startups and big-name venture capitalists. Then, in the span of just a few days, it collapsed. Whispers that SVB might be in trouble spread like wildfire through group texts and Twitter posts. Depositors raced to empty their accounts, withdrawing $42 billion in a single day. Last Friday, after regulators declared that SVB had failed, the FDIC seized the bank.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description More than 20 years ago, something unusual happened in the small town of Dixfield, Maine. A lady named Barbara Thorpe had left almost all of her money—$200,000—to benefit the cats of her hometown. When Barbara died in 2002, those cats suddenly got very, very rich. And that is when all the trouble began.
Barbara&amp;rsquo;s gift set off a sprawling legal battle that drew in a crew of crusading cat ladies, and eventually, the town of Dixfield itself.</description>

In 2005, Franklin Leonard was a junior executive at Leonardo DiCaprio&amp;rsquo;s production company. A big part of his job was to find great scripts. The only thing — most of the 50,000-some scripts registered with the Writers Guild of America every year aren&amp;rsquo;t that great. Franklin was drowning in bad scripts &amp;hellip; So to help find the handful that will become the movies that change our lives, he needed a better way forward.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Every year, the U.S. government spends more money than it takes in. In order to fund all that spending, the country takes on debt. Congress has the power to limit how much debt the U.S. takes on. Right now, the debt limit is $31.4 trillion dollars. Once we reach that limit, Congress has a few options so that the government keeps paying its bills: Raise the debt limit, suspend it, or eliminate it entirely.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A lot of the time, economic policy can seem pretty impersonal — cold, hard, data-driven. But at the heart of the Federal Reserve are people: fallible, complicated people who are just doing their best to steer the economy in the right direction. Often, we remember them just for their economic decisions. But today, we&amp;rsquo;re airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator that profile the people inside the Fed.</description>

For one, it is hard even to get your hands on information about costs, either online or over the phone – day cares will often only share their prices after you have taken a tour of their facilities.

But some papers go even further. The very best papers have the power to change lives.That was the case for three economists we spoke to: Nancy Qian, Belinda Archibong, and Kyle Greenberg.
They all stumbled on important economics papers at crucial moments in their careers, and those papers gave them a new way to see the world.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Monopoly is one of the best-selling board games in history. The game&amp;rsquo;s staying power may in part be because of strong American lore — the idea that anyone, with just a little bit of cash, can rise from rags to riches. Mary Pilon, author of The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World&amp;rsquo;s Favorite Board Game.
But there&amp;rsquo;s another origin story – a very different one that promotes a very different image of capitalism.</description>

We work with The Sadie Collective to bring you three stories from three eras of recent history that show us how the field has changed, where it still falls short, and the unique joys of being a Black woman and loving economics.</description>
