        <description>Podcast Description Listeners, this week we’re bringing you a two-part episode from our Halloween special called The Curse of the Mummy. More than 3,400 years ago, Nefertiti and her husband, the pharaoh Akhenaten, brought sweeping changes to their kingdom. Then she vanished from the historical record. Some believe she died of the plague. Others think she was banished. But some Egyptologists cite evidence that she actually ruled as co-regent with Akhenaten — and then on her own.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From an early age, Brian Jones showed a creative edge and an interest in self-destruction. His rebellious spirit derailed him out of school and into the world of music. In 1962, he would help form the Rolling Stones. By 1969, Jones was out of the band, and soon after, dead. Officially, it was ruled an accidental drowning. But tensions with the law, with his band, and in his business dealings prompted theorists to suggest otherwise.</description>

Or maybe the deadly concoctions came straight from the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson facility itself. In the absence of clear answers, only theories remain… and rumors that someone is still out there, replacing Halloween treats with fatal tricks.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For so long, the government’s stance when it came to UFOs was to deny and debunk. But when declassified and new information started hitting the mainstream — thanks to the work of engineers, private investors, and even musician Tom DeLonge — a new era began. One that chipped away at the taboo surrounding ufology… and has paved a way for incredible new research. This is the last episode of our four-part special with Unexplained Mysteries, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the infamous Roswell crash.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description By the late 1940s the U.S. government knew it had a problem on its hands. “Flying saucers” posed a threat to other aircraft, and possibly even the planet. So they created programs to study UFOs in secret, and stored the evidence in the highly classified Hangar 18. What do we know about their discoveries? And what exactly did they find in the Roswell wreckage? This is the third episode of our 75th Roswell anniversary special.</description>

Unfortunately for Hoover, Truman already thought the Bureau was becoming a secret police force. So he checked their power, and created a separate foreign intelligence agency — what will become the CIA. Meanwhile, Hoover was still bent on rooting out communist infiltrators and Soviet spies. Soon enough, he began handing intel over to Congressional committees like HUAC&amp;hellip; and to his new friend and ally: a rising senator named Joseph McCarthy.</description>
