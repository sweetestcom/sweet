Ideologies are parasites. Their hosts are archetypes. Knowledge of the underlying archetypes can produce immunity against ideological possession.

These categories include the individual (hero/adversary), culture (wise king/tyrant), and nature (destruction/creation). The heroic individual (the knower) is typically masculine, as is culture (the known), while the unknown is feminine. These categories can be conceptualized, as well, as explorer, explored territory, and unexplored territory.</description></item><item><title>134. Maps of Meaning 06: Story and Metastory (Part 2) | The Jordan B.

We frame the world &amp;ndash; or the world reveals itself to us &amp;ndash; as a story, with a starting point, a destination, and the behavioral means to move from one to the other. The destination is valued more highly than the starting point, and constitutes the point of the story &amp;ndash; the aim of the individual. Reality manifests itself within that story as what is relevant for forward movement, what gets in the way, and what is irrelevant and can be safely ignored.</description></item><item><title>133.

These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are). In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing</description></item><item><title>132.

In this lecture, I discuss the context within which the theory I am delineating through this course emerge: that of the cold war. What is belief? Why is it so important to people? Why will they fight to protect it? I propose that belief unites a culture&amp;rsquo;s expectations and desires with the actions of its people, and that the match between those two allows for cooperative action and maintains emotional stability.</description></item><item><title>128.

Often interpreted as an injunction against homosexuality (particularly by those simultaneously claiming identity as Christians and opposed to that orientation), the stories of the angels who visit Abraham, bless him, and then rain destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah are more truly a warning against mistreatment of the stranger and impulsive, dysregulated, sybaritic conduct.

In this lecture, I tell the story of Abraham, who heeds the call of God to leave what was familiar behind and to journey into unknown lands.

In the next series of stories, the Biblical patriarch Abram (later: Abraham) enters into a covenant with God. The history of Israel proper begins with these stories.

This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel.

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being &amp;ndash; both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. Cain&amp;rsquo;s mode of being &amp;ndash; resentful, arrogant and murderous &amp;ndash; arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God.</description></item><item><title>Adam and Eve: Self-Consciousness, Evil, and Death | The Jordan B.

Although I thought I might get to Genesis II in this third lecture, and begin talking about Adam &amp;amp; Eve, it didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out that way. There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation).
