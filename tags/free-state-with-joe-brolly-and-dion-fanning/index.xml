        <description>Podcast Description How do we combat hate?&amp;nbsp;
What happened in the Dublin Riots was driven by far right agitators but how do we fight their message?&amp;nbsp;
Dion and Joe ask how should we treat those on the margins of the hate movement.
Finland has become a world leader in combating hate and misinformation using a curriculum that starts when their kids are five years old. Turns out kids don’t hate “others” unless they have been taught to hate them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What is more mind altering, a trip to Amsterdam or trying to track the lies and deception of the Tories in Britain?
On this week’s Free State, Joe has all the information on a hallucinogenic trip - maybe too much information - in Holland. The Covid Inquiry, Suella Braverman’s propaganda and the return of David Cameron tell us everything about the British establishment. Joe also can’t tell the difference between Dion and a humanoid just out of its box.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When did ‘ceasefire’ become a dirty word?
In the second podcast this week on the destruction of Gaza, Dion and Joe look at how language has been weaponised during the conflict. How did a desire for a ceasefire come to mean that you are, at best, hopelessly naive and, at worst, a Hamas sympathiser? The barbarity of what has been inflicted on the people of Gaza by the Israeli government is changing that view but too slowly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Where is the way out of the horror in Gaza? When the Shankill Road bomb killed ten people in Frizzell’s fish shop 30 years ago there seemed to be no way out of violence and destruction in the north. But a year later there was a ceasefire and by 1998 a peace process that was the envy of the world. It happened because world leaders like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were resolute in working with those who wanted peace.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The world is watching as terror and suffering come to the people of Gaza once more. In this terrible war, there is also a propaganda war.

After the savagery of Hamas on Oct 7th, there is an understandable need among Israelis for a response but indiscriminate attacks on Palestinians will not destroy Hamas.&amp;nbsp;
On Free State this week, Dion and Joe discuss how Israel is breaching international law, anti semitism and why Joe Biden needs to speak truth to Benjamin Netanyahu.</description>

It is a land where fundamentalism, hatred and fear have twisted all hopes for a peaceful existence. Within the country there are voices, even after the horrors of October 7th, calling for restraint.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Israeli government - emboldened by politicians in the west - is committing war crimes. Gaza is a human catastrophe where the horrors will echo through history. There is a primal need within so many Israelis for action to avenge the horrific massacre of the innocents by Hamas. But how is the cycle of violence broken? In the bloodlust for revenge, sane voices in Israel and around the world are being drowned out.</description>

In a powerful and emotional episode of Free State, Pat Gilroy is back with Joe and Dion to talk about Mickey Harte and loyalty.&amp;nbsp;
What is the GAA about? What do we want? Is the association becoming a sham, where there are more barter accounts than at RTÉ?</description>

His life changed that day when he realised that violence is always where hatred leads. Hatred of asylum seekers, Jews, people of colour, the trans community, Muslims, librarians…anyone will do.</description>

This unexceptional teenager fell under the spell of older Neo Nazis and became, in his own words, a vile violent hater, who wanted nothing more than to smash someone, anyone, in the face with a hammer.
Matthew joins Joe and Dion on Free State this week for a two-part interview.</description>
