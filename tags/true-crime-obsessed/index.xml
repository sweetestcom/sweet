Kennedy, President of the United States, was assassinated in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people--at least 55 of whom were filming or taking pictures. And yet we still don't know what happened. Lee Harvey Oswald was the prime suspect. But then he too was killed in the middle of the day in front of almost 100 people. Was it a lone gunman?</description></item><item><title>67: Abducted in Plain Sight | True Crime Obsessed</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9516700358/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 05:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9516700358/</guid><description>Podcast Description On October 17, 1974, 12 year old Jan Broberg was kidnapped by her next door neighbor and parents’ best friend—a man they all loving called “B.” B, unbeknownst to them, was a pedophile who had become obsessed with Jan and would stop at nothing to have her.

Before she became a household name with her work on the Steven Avery case in season 2 of "Making A Murderer," Kathleen Zelner used her brilliant, no-nonsense bad-assery to exonerate Ryan Ferguson. Ferguson had been convicted in 2005 at the age of 19 of a murder he didn't commit. There was no physical evidence, the "eye witnesses" were unreliable to say the least, and Ferguson was failed by an incompetent lawyer.</description></item><item><title>65: The Case of the Cannibal Cop | True Crime Obsessed</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9516700360/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 05:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9516700360/</guid><description>Podcast Description In 2015, NYC Police Officer Gilberto Valle was convicted of conspiring to kidnap and eat young women.

Valle was facing a possible life sentence when filmmaker Erin Lee Carr began visiting him in prison to make this film.
There’s no way around it, you guys, this one is full of garbage—the cannibal cop himself (CANNIBAL COP, YOU GUYS), his enabling parents, and the filmmaker who never really tries to understand WHY and/or HOW Valle came to be the way he is.</description></item><item><title>64: Whitey: United States of America vs. James J.
