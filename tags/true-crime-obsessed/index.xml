        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s been 18 years since Scott Peterson was convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci. In that time, some members of his family have been working tirelessly to prove his innocence--that he couldn&#39;t have killed Laci. Some of their evidence is compelling, but so much of Scott&#39;s story still doesn&#39;t make sense. But Scott&#39;s attorneys are certain that if he&#39;s granted a new trial--which seems more and more likely--they&#39;ll be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that their client is innocent.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description During its 1980s and 1990s heyday, New Jersey’s Action Park earned a reputation as the most insane — and possibly the most dangerous — amusement park that ever existed. It was known as a lawless land, ruled by drunk teenage employees and frequented by even drunker teenage guests. The rides were experimental and illogical, and seemed to ignore even the most basic notions of physics or common sense—not to mention safety.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The title of Ava DuVernay&#39;s extraordinary and galvanizing documentary refers to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted freedom to enslaved people. Except, it didn’t really. The drafters of the amendment included a loophole that allowed for the re-enslavement of any person convicted of a crime. 13th explores The progression from that loophole to the horrors of mass criminalization and the sprawling American prison industry. With a potent mixture of archival footage and testimony from a dazzling array of activists, politicians, historians, and formerly incarcerated women and men, DuVernay creates a work of grand historical synthesis.</description>

Before she became a household name with her work on the Steven Avery case in season 2 of &#34;Making A Murderer,&#34; Kathleen Zelner used her brilliant, no-nonsense bad-assery to exonerate Ryan Ferguson. Ferguson had been convicted in 2005 at the age of 19 of a murder he didn&#39;t commit. There was no physical evidence, the &#34;eye witnesses&#34; were unreliable to say the least, and Ferguson was failed by an incompetent lawyer.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 2015, NYC Police Officer Gilberto Valle was convicted of conspiring to kidnap and eat young women. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT: KIDNAP AND EAT. Valle argued it was all a fantasy; the prosecution&#39;s narrative convinced jurors otherwise. Valle was facing a possible life sentence when filmmaker Erin Lee Carr began visiting him in prison to make this film.
There’s no way around it, you guys, this one is full of garbage—the cannibal cop himself (CANNIBAL COP, YOU GUYS), his enabling parents, and the filmmaker who never really tries to understand WHY and/or HOW Valle came to be the way he is.</description>

In the mood for a great movie about a suuuuper scary exorcism? GO WATCH THE EXORCIST AND SKIP THIS GARBAGE ALL TOGETHER (but don’t be a monster, listen to the episode.) So whatever, the guy who directed The Exorcist gets invited to witness and record an exorcism. He fakes a lot of the audio (WE’RE GUESSING, LAWYERS, DON’T COME FOR US) and then FORGETS HIS CAMERA when he goes to interview THE POSESSED WOMAN and has an ACTUAL SUPERNATURAL ENCOUNTER in a 12th century church.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Look, the specifics of this story are confusing AF. BUT at the heart of it, we’re dealing with a murder, a wrongful conviction, a false confession and A. WOMAN. NAMED. SHAWN. (She’s garbage, but we’re obsessed with the gender swapping name situation.).
With his execution just 48 hours away, Anthony Porter&#39;s life was saved by a Northwestern University journalism class. Their re-investigation of the crime for which he was convicted-a double homicide in a Chicago park-led to the discovery of the real killer, Alstory Simon, whose confession exonerated Porter.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We hate to insult garbage by calling Anthony Weiner garbage...but we can&#39;t think of another word. DING!
Anthony Weiner did a lot for the people of New York as a Congressman from 1999 - 2011. HOWEVER it all went off the rails when he started SEXTING women WHO WEREN&#39;T HIS WIFE (A quick timeout: his wife is Huma Abedin: brilliant woman, close adviser to Hilliary Clinton, and human-who-will-not-stand-for-your-shit). His resignation from Congress was quickly followed by a run for Mayor of New York City and, because (some) men will be (some) men, MORE DICK PICS TO WOMEN WHO AREN&#39;T HIS WIFE CAME OUT!</description>

&#34;How To Survive A Plague&#34; is a riveting, powerful telling of the story of the grassroots movement of activists, many of them in a life-or-death struggle, who seized upon scientific research to help develop the drugs that turned HIV from a mostly fatal infection to a manageable disease. Ignored by public officials, religious leaders, and the nation at large, and confronted with shame and hatred, this small group of men and women chose to fight for their right to live by educating themselves and demanding to become full partners in the race for effective treatments.</description>
