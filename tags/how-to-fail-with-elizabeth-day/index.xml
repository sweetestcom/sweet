Which, in a way, is apt because Marina Abramovic is one of our greatest living artists and renowned for expressing through her work, the thoughts, feelings and emotional impulses that lie beyond words.
Born in 1946 in post-war Yugoslavia, she painted from the age of 14 and spent the next 50 years pushing herself to extremes of physical and mental endurance in search of fundamental truths.</description></item><item><title>S18, Ep5 Geri Halliwell-Horner on writing, grief - and what the Spice Girls taught her | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150009/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150009/</guid><description>Podcast Description On this week&amp;rsquo;s episode, I welcome the all-singing, all-writing, all-dancing POWERHOUSE that is Geri Halliwell-Horner.

Sara Pascoe is a critically acclaimed comedian, writer and actor. Her latest stand-up tour is called - aptly enough for this podcast - Success and her debut novel, Weirdo, is published tomorrow. It&amp;rsquo;s a dark, funny, stream-of-consciousness narrative ride through the internal machinations of Sophie, an anxious, sometimes obsessive, often unhappy woman trying to feel less lost. I gobbled it up.
Sara joins me to talk about failing at acting, why every year she promises herself she&amp;rsquo;ll never do the Edinburgh Fringe again (and every year breaks that promise) and, in a heartbreaking third failure, she talks candidly about failing to get pregnant for over a decade, suffering a miscarriage, doing IVF and eventually having a baby but remaining in a state of high anxiety throughout her pregnancy.</description></item><item><title>S18, Ep1 Miriam Margolyes on not marrying a nice Jewish doctor | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150013/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150013/</guid><description>Podcast Description WAHOOOOO!

He is one of the most popular instructors on the platform, with over 1 million Instagram followers, and counts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak amongst his die-hard fans.</description></item><item><title>S16, Ep11 How To Fail: Bernie Sanders on defeat, defiance and the struggles that shaped him (plus: the power of mittens) | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150034/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 01:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150034/</guid><description>Podcast Description PINCH ME, IS THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?

I have admired this woman from afar for many years and was so honoured when she agreed to sit down with me for How To Fail.

In her UTTERLY BRILLIANT new book, Transitional, Munroe draws on her own experience to reveal just how deeply ingrained transitioning is in human experience.</description></item><item><title>S16, Ep6 How To Fail: Rick Edwards on confidence, competitiveness and the lessons he's learned from past relationships | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150039/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 01:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150039/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rick Edwards is a broadcaster, author and podcaster.

Her tireless work over the years - she is now 88 - has won her a legion of admirers, including David Attenborough, Leonardo di Caprio, Prince Harry and Greta Thunberg who calls Goodall ‘a true hero’. She joins me to talk about the resilience of hope, whether chimpanzees have a sense of failure, her own failures in language, correspondence and motherhood, and her belief in the next generation.</description></item><item><title>S14, BONUS EPISODE!

Russell Kane is a comedian, novelist, playwright, podcaster, memoirist and presenter. He&amp;rsquo;s know for his sell-out stand-up gigs across and for his TV work, including Live At the Apollo and Celebrity Juice. Plus he has two -count &amp;rsquo;em - podcasts, Evil Genius and Man Baggage.
I think Russell is genuinely one of the smartest people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever interviewed and his mind functions at about three times the speed of everyone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>S14, Ep8 How To Fail: Asim Chaudhry | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150070/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150070/</guid><description>Podcast Description As well as being a stone-cold legend, Asim Chaudhry is probably best known for co-creating the BAFTA-award-winning mockumentary sitcom People Just Do Nothing and if you’ve ever been on a British Airways flight and paid attention to the safety video, you’ll recognised him instantly as the inept director of a sketch involving national treasures Sir Michael Caine and Olivia Colman. He&amp;rsquo;s an actor, writer, director and musician. And he&amp;rsquo;s also hilarious.</description></item><item><title>S14, Ep7 How To Fail: Benjamin Zephaniah | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150071/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150071/</guid><description>Podcast Description Benjamin Zephaniah was the author of the first poetry collection I ever owned. For many of us, he was the chronicler of our youth: a novelist and poet who made language exciting and funny and told stories full of action and hilarity. I was so excited to get to speak to him for today&amp;rsquo;s episode, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t let me down. We talk about his failure as a &amp;lsquo;gangsta&amp;rsquo; - and his early brushes with the law (he served a prison sentence for burglary) as well as what being incarcerated taught him.</description></item><item><title>S14, Ep6 How To Fail: Warsan Shire | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150072/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150072/</guid><description>Podcast Description TW // eating disorders
I&amp;rsquo;m biased but oh my goodness, I love this guest and this episode SO much. Ahead of Refugee Week, which runs 20-26th June, it is my honour to welcome the poet Warsan Shire to the podcast. Warsan was born in Kenya to Somali parents. She migrated with her family to the UK at the age of one and her powerful poem Home - which opens with the line ‘no one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark - has become the unofficial anthem to raise awareness of the refugee crisis.</description></item><item><title>S14, MID-SEASON BONUS!

After an interview, if Chris says &amp;lsquo;yeah, that was good&amp;rsquo; I know I&amp;rsquo;ve struck GOLD. Today&amp;rsquo;s episode garnered TWO SEPARATE &amp;lsquo;yeah that was good&amp;rsquo;(s) from Chris which is why I know it&amp;rsquo;s a very special one. And of course it would be, because my guest is the truly wonderful Michael Rosen. He is the author of more than 200 books, including some of the most beloved children’s stories of all time.</description></item><item><title>S14, Ep4 How To Fail: Natasha Brown | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150075/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150075/</guid><description>Podcast Description Natasha Brown is the author behind one of my favourite novels of recent years.

He was the frontman of Pulp, one of the most successful 90s Britpop groups whose hit, Common People, turned Jarvis into a star at the age of 32. He joins me to talk about the vagaries of fame, his failures in acting and academia, abandonment by his father, being raised by a household of women and the impact this has had on him, as well as divorce, co-parenting, clearing out the loft and why ephemera is an important part of our culture.</description></item><item><title>S14, Ep2 How To Fail: Minnie Driver | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150077/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150077/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ugh.

Minnie Driver, actress, musician and writer, was nominated for an Academy Award for Good Will Hunting and later starred in TV shows such as Will &amp;amp; Grace and Starstruck. Her (brilliant) debut book is called Managing Expectations and is described as a ‘tell-most memoir’.

As Dushane, the East London drug kingpin in Netflix&amp;rsquo;s hit show Top Boy, Walters is our favourite kind of antihero - and it’s a role he’s about to reprise for the fourth series.
He joins me to talk about his own upbringing in Peckham, South London, an only child raised on a council estate by his mother, Pamela, and what it was like combining that reality with a burgeoning love for acting which sometimes felt like a double life.</description></item><item><title>S13, Ep8 How To Fail: Delia Smith | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150083/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 01:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150083/</guid><description>Podcast Description Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s the SEASON FINALE so you bet I&amp;rsquo;m going to use CapsLock. And for our final episode of Season 13, I speak to the cooking legend that is Delia Smith.
But if you&amp;rsquo;re expecting a chat about her failure to poach an egg in 1986, you&amp;rsquo;re very much mistaken. Because, at 80, Delia has just written a new book about the meaning of life. Called You Matter, it&amp;rsquo;s an insightful inquisition into what it is to be human.</description></item><item><title>S13, Ep7 How To Fail: Dr Rangan Chatterjee | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150084/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 01:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150084/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rangan Chatterjee is one of the most influential doctors in the UK and has pioneered a different kind of approach in healing the sick.

Self Esteem has been providing me with my preferred soundtrack for life, the universe and just about everything since the release of her BRILLIANT second album, Prioritise Pleasure, last year. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who&amp;rsquo;s obsessed - it was the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s album of the year and earned her a Brit Award nomination. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet listened to her soaringly beautiful anthem, I Do This All The Time, then do that right after you&amp;rsquo;ve heard this.</description></item><item><title>S13, Ep5 How to Fail: Munya Chawawa | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150086/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 01:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150086/</guid><description>Podcast Description Munya Chawawa is the comedian who repeatedly went viral during the pandemic thanks to his hilarious social media videos.

He&amp;rsquo;s also the host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, which recently reached the number one slot on both Apple Podcasts and Spotify. And all this before his 30th birthday. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d have to hate him if I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he was so great.
Steven joins me to talk about his first business failing, a relationship break-up, toxic masculinity, his failure to tap into his feminine side, the art of making decisions and the power of knowing when to quit.</description></item><item><title>S13, Ep1 How To Fail: Brené Brown | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150090/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 01:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150090/</guid><description>Podcast Description We’re back for a brand new season and PINCH ME BECAUSE I TRULY CAN’T BELIEVE I’M WRITING THIS but…

She&amp;rsquo;s ridiculously talented, an all-round legend and also, as my tremendous good luck would have it, the audiobook narrator for Magpie - this episode even includes an exclusive chapter.</description></item><item><title>S12, Ep1 How to Fail: Derren Brown | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150102/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:08:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150102/</guid><description>Podcast Description My first guest for Season 12 is mind-blowing in the truest sense of the word. Derren Brown has had a 20-year television and stage career, during which he has deployed magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship with extraordinary - and sometimes - controversial results. He played Russian roulette live on screen. He predicted the results of the National Lottery. He convinced law-abiding citizens to rob a bank. He&amp;rsquo;s also a painter and bestselling author.</description></item><item><title>S11, BONUS EPISODE How to Fail: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150103/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150103/</guid><description>Podcast Description When I started this podcast, I had a list of dream guests.* At the top was Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her third novel, Americanah, is one of my favourite books of all time. I can remember exactly where I was when I read it. I was moved by the power of its epic sweep, the brilliance of its observations and the characters who made your heart break.
But although she&amp;rsquo;s an amazing writer, Chimamanda&amp;rsquo;s cultural reach goes much further than the literary world.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep8 How to Fail: Maggie O'Farrell | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150104/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:45:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150104/</guid><description>Podcast Description For our season finale, I bring you the glorious Maggie O&amp;rsquo;Farrell.

To mark the third anniversary of How To Fail, I invite back the one and only Dolly Alderton.
Dolly was one of my first ever guests in the debut season of How To Fail, way back in the mists of time (by which I mean the summer of 2018). Back then, she had just published her memoir Everything I Know About Love a few months earlier. She could have had little idea of the success that was to follow: it became a bestseller, won Autobiography of the Year at the National Book Awards and was selected for Stylist magazine’s best books of the decade by remarkable woman.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep7 How to Fail: Martine Wright | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150106/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 06:56:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150106/</guid><description>Podcast Description Martine Wright is a survivor of the 7/7 London terrorist bombings.

Today, my guest is the absolute PEACH of a human that is Paris Lees. Paris is an award-winning journalist and a Contributing Editor for British Vogue. She was the first trans woman to present on BBC Radio 1 and Channel 4 and the first to appear on Question Time. Her recently published memoir, What It Feels Like For A Girl, is the uniquely told, semi-fictionalised story of her childhood in Nottinghamshire - which included a spell as a rent boy and an eight-month prison sentence for armed robbery - and the refuge she found in partying, music and, eventually, books.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep5 How to Fail: Christie Watson | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150108/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150108/</guid><description>Podcast Description Christie Watson is a nurse turned bestselling author who went back to frontline nursing during the Covid-19 pandemic. But if you were to call her a &amp;lsquo;hero&amp;rsquo; she would refuse the label - and during the course of this interview, she tells me why.
Watson left school at 16 and volunteered at a charity before training to become a nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital. She spent the next 20 years in hospitals in various disciplines and mainly in paediatric intensive care.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep4 How to Fail: Guvna B | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150109/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:35:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150109/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest today is Guvna B, the MOBO-award winning rapper, author and broadcaster.

Guvna B - otherwise known as Isaac Borquaye - joins me to talk about the death of his father, and two of his close friends, and how he had to address his grief in order to carry on living.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep3 How to Fail: Ed Miliband | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150110/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:16:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150110/</guid><description>Podcast Description I absolutely loved this interview.

Ed joins me to discuss his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failing to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep2 How to Fail: Jessica Ennis-Hill | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150111/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 07:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150111/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill is an Olympic heptathlon gold medallist and a three-time world champion. This is a woman who knows what it takes to succeed at the very highest levels, and who has learned to process failure when she doesn&amp;rsquo;t win. I learned so much from her insight. And she&amp;rsquo;s still only 35!
We had a truly fascinating conversation about the psychology of competitiveness, the importance of loyalty and roots, how injury taught her the value of rest and how losing the 2011 World Championship to a woman who later turned out to be a drugs cheat fuelled Ennis-Hill&amp;rsquo;s desire to do better.</description></item><item><title>S11, Ep1 How to Fail: Graham Norton | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150112/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 06:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150112/</guid><description>Podcast Description What better way to kick off a new season of interviews by interviewing one of the very best interviewers?

If you&amp;rsquo;re watching season six of Jed Mercurio&amp;rsquo;s addictive police procedural, I suspect you will be obsessed with this interview (and yes, of course I ask him about &amp;lsquo;H&amp;rsquo;) but if you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen Line of Duty, I promise you&amp;rsquo;ll still love it because Adrian is such a wonderful, thoughtful guest.</description></item><item><title>S10, Ep8 How to Fail: Kazuo Ishiguro | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150115/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 08:04:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150115/</guid><description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s the season finale, so obviously I insisted our last guest be a Nobel Prize winner and&amp;hellip;HERE HE IS! Kazuo Ishiguro, arguably one of our greatest writers of contemporary fiction, and a very lovely man to boot. His most famous book, The Remains of the Day, was written when Ishiguro was only 35.

This is the manual every single self-identifying people pleaser needs to read (and in fact, even those who don&amp;rsquo;t think they are people-pleasers should read it because Emma has helpful advice for you too).</description></item><item><title>S10, Ep6 How to Fail: Jim Down | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150117/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 07:45:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150117/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today&amp;rsquo;s episode is an important one.

He is a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at University College London Hospital, running the intensive care unit at one of London’s busiest hospitals, where life and death decisions are an everyday occurrence.
Despite having spent all his adult life working in these conditions, nothing could have prepared Jim Down for Covid-19.</description></item><item><title>S10, Ep5 How to Fail: Dr Nicole LePera, The Holistic Psychologist | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150118/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150118/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, Dr Nicole LePera is here to blow your mind.

At the time of recording, her book was about to come out in paperback, but that&amp;rsquo;s been pushed back to 8th July because, well, pandemic.</description></item><item><title>S10, Ep3 How to Fail: Alexandra Burke | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150120/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:11:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150120/</guid><description>Podcast Description Alexandra Burke shot to fame as the 2008 winner of The X Factor. She became the first British female solo artist to have a million-selling single and went on to have a successful career as both a recording artist and a performer: her lead roles in the stage adaptations of The Bodyguard and Sister Act met with rave reviews.
But behind the public profile were private battles: her beloved mother was dying, she was subjected to racism in the music industry and her story was frequently misreported in the media.</description></item><item><title>S10, Ep2 How to Fail: Matt Haig | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150121/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150121/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, I invite you to listen to one of my most-requested guests.

Navigating the days between Christmas and New Year can be tricky at the best of times, but in 2020 there&amp;rsquo;s an extra layer of WTAF. So I knew I wanted to talk to someone motivating, but not annoying; someone who could nudge us gently into 2021, without making us feel like we weren&amp;rsquo;t already good enough; someone sweet and funny who wasn&amp;rsquo;t smug; someone who, in short, is as sceptical about New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions as I am and can instead make us all feel better about who we are right now.</description></item><item><title>How to Fail: A Christmas Message | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150124/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150124/</guid><description>Podcast Description An alternative Christmas message for anyone who needs it.

But, after living with depression all her life and a series of breakdowns, she got a Masters from Oxford University in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy and is now a mental health campaigner and author.</description></item><item><title>S9, Ep3 How to Fail: Annie Nightingale | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150136/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 16:49:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150136/</guid><description>Podcast Description At the age of 80, Annie Nightingale still manages to be one of the most forward-looking and future-facing people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever interviewed. She is the legendary Radio 1 DJ - the first woman ever to get a job at the station and now the BBC&amp;rsquo;s longest-serving presenter and a vital force in British music.
Annie joins me to talk about confronting sexism, breaking the mould, getting the best of of interviewees and what it&amp;rsquo;s like to have met everyone from David Bowie to Paul McCartney to Eminem and Jim Morrison (he didn&amp;rsquo;t impress her much tbf).</description></item><item><title>S9, Ep2 How to Fail: Mohsin Zaidi | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150137/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 07:07:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150137/</guid><description>Podcast Description Mohsin Zaidi&amp;rsquo;s memoir, A Dutiful Boy, is one of the most powerful and emotive books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year. It tells the story of his upbringing in a poor pocket of east London, in a devout Shia Muslim community. His family were close-knit and religiously conservative. From a young age, Mohsin knew that his sexuality was a secret he had to hide in a household where being gay was viewed as an inconceivable taboo.</description></item><item><title>S9, Ep1 How to Fail: Adam Buxton | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150138/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 05:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150138/</guid><description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo;S SEASON NINE AND I FEEL FINE, BABY! And we open with a humdinger - the podcasting king, comedy legend and all-round thoroughly decent bloke that is&amp;hellip;[drum roll + X Factor announcer voice]&amp;hellip;ADAM BUXTON.
Adam joins me to talk about misdirected perfectionism, dropping out of university, mid-life crises and what it means to be a parent after the death of your own. We talk about privilege, being sent to boarding school aged nine, whether he feels rivalry with his astonishingly successful friends (coughs Louis Theroux coughs) and about what makes a bad spoon.</description></item><item><title>S8, BONUS EPISODE!

Gloria ACTUAL Steinem.
For this very special bonus episode, I had the absolute honour of interviewing one of my all-time heroes, the feminist activist, writer and icon, Gloria Steinem. And yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still pinching myself.
We talk about her failure to understand her mother, her failure to be at her father&amp;rsquo;s deathbed and her failure to learn lessons quickly enough - yes, we go deep&amp;hellip; She also talks to me about how, at the age of 86, she is joyfully outliving society&amp;rsquo;s expectations of her; of how fear can often be a sign of growth (let that sink in), about how &amp;lsquo;anger is an energy cell&amp;rsquo;, about how we are &amp;rsquo;linked not ranked&amp;rsquo;, about not having children, about spending a lifetime combatting misogyny and racism and sexism and injustice, and about the counteracting forces of love and compassion and friendship which keep her going.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep8 How to Fail: Bernardine Evaristo | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150140/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:05:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150140/</guid><description>Podcast Description It is the SEASON FINALE, BABY! I know, I know - it goes so quickly doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? But here we are, two months after we started season eight, with a truly phenomenal guest. Bernardine Evaristo was the first black woman to win the Booker Prize, with her stunning novel, Girl Woman Other. She joins me to talk about her failure to be an actor, her failure to drive from London to Australia (hey, it happens to the best of us) and&amp;hellip;brilliantly&amp;hellip;her failure to be a lesbian.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep7 How to Fail: Siena Castellon | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150141/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:07:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150141/</guid><description>Podcast Description Siena Castellon is my youngest ever guest.

Her book, The Spectrum Girl&amp;rsquo;s Survival Guide: How to Grow Up Awesome and Autistic, is a brilliant guide for neurodiverse girls navigating a neurotypical world. It is packed full of information and insight into many of the challenges that autistic teen girls face.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep6 How to Fail: Glennon Doyle | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150142/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 06:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150142/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, I bring you the utterly sensational Glennon Doyle. She is the author of three books, the latest of which, Untamed, is a memoir that defies easy categorisation - somewhat like the woman herself. Untamed is thrilling, original and brave. In it, Glennon dismantles our socialised preconceptions of what women should be and challenges us all to look at the boxes we&amp;rsquo;re trapped in that are not of our own making.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep5 How to Fail: Julia Samuel | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150143/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:11:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150143/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today&amp;rsquo;s guest is someone I fell in platonic love with by reading her work. Julia Samuel is one of the country&amp;rsquo;s leading psychotherapists but she is also well-known as an author. Her first book, Grief Works, was a Sunday Times bestseller and is routinely cited as one of the most helpful and compassionate books on bereavement you will ever read. Her second book, This Too Shall Pass, Stories of Change, Crisis and Hopeful Beginnings, was published just before lockdown and could not have been a more insightful guide to the uncertain times we all found ourselves in.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep4 How to Fail: Scarlett Moffatt | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150144/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:22:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150144/</guid><description>Podcast Description Scarlett Moffatt was working at the checkout in Asda when she and he family got the chance to be on Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s Gogglebox. She rapidly became the show&amp;rsquo;s break-out star with her brilliant one-liners. Television fame followed - she co-presented with Ant and Dec, won 2016&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;m A Celebrity and now hosts the official podcast for Rupaul’s Drag Race UK. But with her overnight celebrity also came increased scrutiny and criticism.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep3 How to Fail: Matthew Syed | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150145/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:40:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150145/</guid><description>Podcast Description Matthew Syed is an acclaimed author, newspaper columnist and broadcaster. He is also, in many ways, is the father of failure. I mean that as a compliment, obviously. Through his seminal, bestselling books - Bounce, Black Box Thinking and his latest, Rebel Ideas - he has shown again and again that failure can actually be the richest seam of data acquisition. His interest in making mistakes in order to evolve started, incongruously, with table tennis.</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep2 How to Fail: Samantha Irby | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150146/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 06:56:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150146/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode was recorded before recent tragic events in America.

You know when you read someone&amp;rsquo;s work and feel like you&amp;rsquo;d be friends in real life, and you become basically a little obsessed and Google them to inhale all the online content that is out there about this person and their work and THEN you get to to meet them and despite thinking they couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly live up to all your overhyped expectation, they actually do?</description></item><item><title>S8, Ep1 How to Fail: Jessie Ware | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150147/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 07:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150147/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode was recorded before recent tragic events in America.

WE&amp;rsquo;RE BAAAAAACCCCKKKK just like Backstreet, The Mack, and the toilet roll that&amp;rsquo;s now in stock again in Sainsbury&amp;rsquo;s. And what a guest I have for you! It is the one, the only, Jessie Ware. Not only is she one of my favourite singer-songwriters (four Brit nominations to her name, three top-ten albums and a whopping 120 million streams on Spotify for one of her most famous songs, Say You Love Me&amp;hellip;JUST SAYIN) but she&amp;rsquo;s also one of my favourite podcasters, co-hosting the brilliant Table Manners with her mother, Lennie and interviewing an array of astonishing talent over a home-cooked dinner.</description></item><item><title>SPECIAL EPISODE!

The reason for this is that I watched Normal People and thought it was the most exceptional piece of television I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in&amp;hellip;well&amp;hellip;an absolute age, and I basically hunted down Daisy Edgar-Jones like the obsessive fan I was until she agreed to be interviewed by me.
And so here it is: Daisy Edgar-Jones, who gave the performance of a lifetime as Marianne in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed novel, Normal People, joins me for the most beautiful chat about failing to go to university, feeling the need for constant validation, wanting to do things for their own artistic sake but being hamstrung by other people&amp;rsquo;s approval, body image, living with anxiety (which manifests as hypochondria), feeling lost in her late teens, dealing with rejection, the weirdness of overnight fame and Connell&amp;rsquo;s silver chain (in-joke there for Normal People mega-fans).</description></item><item><title>SPECIAL EPISODE!

This week, How To Fail returns to its usual format of discussing three failures but I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to make this a special episode because one of Henry&amp;rsquo;s failures will speak directly to a lot of people right now. It is the failure of his business, House of Holland, a failure linked to the impact of Coronavirus and which has left Henry having to call in the administrators and let beloved members of staff go.</description></item><item><title>SPECIAL EPISODE!

And you did not let me down. I received so many responses that when I printed them out they ran to over 100 pages of typed text. I wished I could read every single one of them out, but that would have taken quite a long time, so I did the best I could and picked a selection of the most moving, most eloquent, most reassuring, most funny, most inspiring, most heroic stories you are ever likely to hear.</description></item><item><title>SPECIAL EPISODE!

We talk about the fact that, right now, it&amp;rsquo;s rational to be a little demented and how we should all take lessons from our childhood and be less ashamed of bursting into tears when we really need to.</description></item><item><title>SPECIAL EPISODE!

I hope you&amp;rsquo;re all doing ok out there. Bit of a strange time isn&amp;rsquo;t it? It can feel overwhelming to be living through a global pandemic, but there are things all of us can do - small things that can have big impact. We can stay at home and save lives. We can distance socially and help the heroic health carers working on the frontline of this disease.</description></item><item><title>S7, BONUS EPISODE!

This week, I talk to Ella Mills, aka Deliciously Ella, the woman who launched an empire of plant-based foodstuffs, delis, bestselling cookbooks and fitness apps, all designed to make you live a healthier life.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep8 How to Fail: Frankie Bridge | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150154/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 12:10:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150154/</guid><description>Podcast Description Frankie Bridge is probably best known as a member of one of the UK&amp;rsquo;s most successful girl bands of all time, The Saturdays. But, more recently, it&amp;rsquo;s as a mental health advocate that she has been making headlines. Her new memoir, Open: Why asking for help can save your life, is a brave and unflinchingly honest attempt to destigmatise the conditions that so many of us struggle with in private.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep7 How to Fail: Adam Pearson | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150155/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150155/</guid><description>Podcast Description So. This podcast episode almost didn&amp;rsquo;t happen because I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to put it into my iCal (I find any diary that isn&amp;rsquo;t paper so confusing, don&amp;rsquo;t you?) and on the allotted day, I had a text from sound engineer Chris saying &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re outside!&amp;rsquo;. Needless to say, I was not inside. I was half-an-hour away having breakfast with my friend Viv.
It is a testament to Adam Pearson&amp;rsquo;s kindness that, when I spoke to him, harassed and sweating as I ran for the train, he didn&amp;rsquo;t seem remotely put out.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep6 How to Fail: Marian Keyes | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150156/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150156/</guid><description>Podcast Description Marian Keyes is one of those people who you think can&amp;rsquo;t POSSIBLY be as lovely and talented and nice as everyone says she is. She must have a hidden dark side, I thought. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;s a terrible diva who will demand bowls of blue M&amp;amp;Ms and want my toilet freshly re-painted and scented with vanilla before she deigns to use it?
But then you meet her and - lo and behold - she is not only as lovely as everyone says she is, but in fact EVEN NICER than that.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep5 How to Fail: Eniola Aluko | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150157/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150157/</guid><description>Podcast Description Eniola Aluko is a former footballer who bears the notable distinction of being one of only 11 women to play for England over 100 times and the first ever female pundit on Match of the Day. Born in Nigeria, she was raised on a Birmingham council estate, where her talent for football was obvious from a young age. At 15 she signed up for Birmingham City Ladies.

Yes&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s Tom Kerridge! And what a chef he is. He failed at school, but found his way in catering college after the death of his Dad. He climbed the ranks of the profession, working hard and partying harder. Professional success followed, at the same time as personal failure - the long hours triggered a drink problem and he became unhealthily overweight.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep3 How to Fail: Mabel | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150159/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150159/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest today has the middle name Alabama-Pearl, which is pretty cool but NOT QUITE AS COOL as the fact that she&amp;rsquo;s a chart-topping pop-star who has racked up three top-10 hits and recently wrote one of the best Christmas songs of all time, Loneliest Time of the Year (and I say that as a die-hard Mariah fan). Plus, my guest is still only 23 years old.

My guest this week is Malcolm Gladwell, a man who has challenged and changed the way we think with six bestselling books including The Tipping Point, Blink and Outliers. Gladwell also hosts his own highly successful podcast, Revisionist History and is basically 98% brain. Obviously this makes him quite an intimidating prospect to interview, but luckily he was extremely nice and, as luck would have it, his new book is all about how we can best talk to strangers.</description></item><item><title>S7, Ep1 How to Fail: Andrew Scott | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150161/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150161/</guid><description>Podcast Description HAPPPPPY NEW YEAAARRRR!

You are simply caught up in this messy business of being human and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.

Lemn is a poet, author and broadcaster whose memoir, My Name Is Why, is one of the most moving I have ever read.

When she launched Happy Place in March 2018, it went straight to the top of the iTunes chart and has seemingly stayed there ever since. It has done so much to bring discussions about mental health into the mainstream, partly because Fearne has also been honest about her own experiences with panic attacks and anxiety.
So when I started How To Fail in July 2018, I always knew Fearne would be top of my list of dream guests.</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep6 How to Fail: George Alagiah | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150165/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 05:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150165/</guid><description>Podcast Description For 15 years, George Alagiah has been a familiar face on our television screens as the presenter of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s Six O&amp;rsquo;Clock News. Before that, he was one of the corporation&amp;rsquo;s most respected foreign correspondents. Before that, he was born in what was then Ceylon, the only boy in a family of four sisters, and was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 12.
George joins me to talk about his self-perceived failures at fatherhood, the challenges of reporting from the front-line in times of humanitarian crisis, his nuanced relationship with racial identity and how he dealt with racist incidents in his youth.</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep5 How to Fail: Shirlie Kemp | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150166/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150166/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, I welcome Shirlie Kemp to the podcast. She was an 80s icon: a backing dancer for Wham! who ACTUALLY APPEARED IN THE MUSIC VIDEO FOR &amp;lsquo;LAST CHRISTMAS&amp;rsquo;, as well as being a best friend to George Michael until his untimely death in 2016 at the age of 53. She was also one-half of the pop duo Pepsi &amp;amp; Shirlie and the wife of Martin Kemp, of Spandau Ballet fame (fun fact: their son, Roman, is the Capital Radio DJ).</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep4 How to Fail: Lisa Taddeo | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150167/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150167/</guid><description>Podcast Description Lisa Taddeo is a phenomenon. Although she is too humble to recognise that description of herself. But this is a journalist and author who spent eight years - EIGHT YEARS - of her life travelling the United States and embedding herself in the lives of three &amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; women in order to report back on that hitherto unexplored topic: female desire as it really is. Not as pornographic exploitation or rom-com fantasy viewed through the male gaze, but as women truly experience love and loss and expectation and sex and marriage and crushes and abuse and threesomes and motherhood and daughterhood and sisterhood and all the liminal spaces in between.</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep3 How to Fail: Cush Jumbo | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150168/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150168/</guid><description>Podcast Description [TW: suicide]
If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of The Good Wife or The Good Fight (and if not, why not?) you will know Cush Jumbo as Lucca Quinn, the whip-smart, ambitious lawyer who speaks with a flawless American accent. But Cush was actually born in South London, the daughter of a British mother and a Nigerian father and the second of six children. She took dance classes from the age of three, and went on to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama.</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep2 How to Fail: Alain De Botton | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150169/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150169/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on How To Fail, we are doing something slightly different. I know, I know, we don&amp;rsquo;t like change, but sometimes IT&amp;rsquo;S GOOD FOR US. It&amp;rsquo;s especially good for us when it comes in the form of Alain de Botton, one of the most intelligent, eloquent and thoughtful people on the planet.
And because it&amp;rsquo;s Alain de Botton, modern philosopher, founder of The School of Life and bestselling authors of life-changing books such as Essays In Love, I decided to allow him a little leeway.</description></item><item><title>S6, Ep1 How to Fail: Camilla Thurlow | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150170/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150170/</guid><description>Podcast Description We&amp;rsquo;re back! Did you miss us? Go on&amp;hellip;say you did. I&amp;rsquo;m really very, very needy.
It&amp;rsquo;s such a treat for me to be opening season six with a truly fantastic guest: Camilla Thurlow. Camilla was always one of the most genuine and impressive contestants on ITV2&amp;rsquo;s hit reality show, Love Island. A former bomb disposal expert who worked in life and death situations in Cambodia and Afghanistan, she came second in the 2017 series.</description></item><item><title>S5 BONUS EPISODE!

The end of another season. Where does the time go?
I saved this guest for the finale because she&amp;rsquo;s bloody spectacular. Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, a campaigner on women&amp;rsquo;s rights, an outspoken critic of Brexit, anti-semitism and the politics of the hard-left, and the author of an acclaimed book, Everywoman: One Woman&amp;rsquo;s Truth About Speaking The Truth.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep7 How to Fail: Meera Syal | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150173/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 04:48:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150173/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, I welcome the multi-talented Meera Syal to the podcast: actor, comedian, playwright, novelist, producer and, most notably, sister-of-my-friend-Rajeev. Meera first came to prominence when she co-wrote and starred in the award-winning BBC comedy series Goodness Gracious Me and was Bafta-nominated for her later role in The Kumars at Number 42. She, along with her husband Sanjeev Bhaskar, almost single-handedly reinvented British-Asian comedy, taking it from the stereotypical and lazy racist tropes of old and bringing it brilliantly into the mainstream (I mean, who can forget the hilarious &amp;lsquo;Going for an English&amp;rsquo; sketch?</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep6 How to Fail: Samin Nosrat | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150174/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150174/</guid><description>Podcast Description Oh, Samin Nosrat! Where do I start? With her ebullient personality and wildly infectious laugh? With her four-part Netflix show, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat where she travels the world eating freshly baked focaccia and Japanese seaweed? Or with the award-winning, bestselling cookbook of the same name, that revolutionised the way we thought about food?
I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. So let me just tell you that she is one of the bubbliest, most open and generous interviewees I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep5 How to Fail: Dame Kelly Holmes | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150175/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150175/</guid><description>Podcast Description I&amp;rsquo;m so delighted to welcome my first ever OLYMPIC ATHLETE onto the podcast this week. And not just any Olympic athlete, but double-gold medal winner, Kelly Holmes, who also just so happens to be my first DAME on How To Fail too.
Dame Kelly joins me to talk about how her single mother was pressurised to give Kelly up for adoption as a baby and how she refused to do so, teaching her daughter about what it is to be truly strong.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep4 How to Fail: Francesca Segal | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150176/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150176/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, my guest is the writer Francesca Segal whose recently published memoir, Mother Ship, details the birth of her twin daughters 10 weeks prematurely. Her first failure is, in Segal&amp;rsquo;s own words, her failure &amp;rsquo;to stay pregnant&amp;rsquo; and the feeling of shame that came from not having managed to provide the requisite 40-week gestation period. &amp;lsquo;I felt I had failed at my first ever task of motherhood,&amp;rsquo; she explains.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep3 How to Fail: Emeli Sandé | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150177/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150177/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, I chat to the chart-topping singer Emeli Sandé about life, love, fame&amp;hellip;and all the nitty gritty bits in between. Emeli has sold over 19 million singles, won four Brit Awards and is about to return after a three-year break with her hotly anticipated third album, Real Life. Her rise to fame was rapid and overwhelming. Celebrity, she says, took some time to get used to.
She joins me to talk about her body image and the long journey to self-acceptance in an industry that frequently made her feel like she was never &amp;rsquo;enough&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep2 How To Fail: FLEABAG IS BACK | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150178/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150178/</guid><description>Podcast Description Yes. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is back.
One year on from her debut appearance on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, my first ever guest returns to talk about the craziness of her last 12 months, during which she has written and starred in Fleabag 2 (described as a televisual masterpiece by&amp;hellip;well&amp;hellip;almost everyone), made Killing Eve (described as a televisual masterpiece by&amp;hellip;well&amp;hellip;almost everyone) and been brought in by the James Bond producers to work her magic on the franchise.</description></item><item><title>S5, Ep1 How to Fail: Nigel Slater | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150179/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150179/</guid><description>Podcast Description We’re BAAACK! As House of Pain once rapped in their immortal hit Jump Around, ‘Just like the Prodigal Son I’ve returned’. Yes, here we are for Season 5 of How To Fail With Elizabeth Day: eight sparkling new episodes featuring eight marvellous guests.
And for our opening episode, I could not be happier to welcome the legendary Nigel Slater to the podcast. The bestselling and beloved cookery writer, whose books have adorned every kitchen worth its (Maldon) salt for decades, joins me to talk about his failure to be a proper chef, his fear that he let his father down and his failure to be a good friend.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep8 How to Fail: Jamie Laing | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150180/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150180/</guid><description>Podcast Description &amp;lsquo;And now, the end is near / And so I face the final curtain&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s the SEASON FINALE! I know, I know: it&amp;rsquo;s gone so fast hasn&amp;rsquo;t it? What&amp;rsquo;s that they say about time flying when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun calling your brain Becky? (That&amp;rsquo;s a podcast in-joke, peeps, don&amp;rsquo;t panic if you&amp;rsquo;re a new subscriber and you haven&amp;rsquo;t got a clue what I&amp;rsquo;m on about, but do check out my episode with Mo Gawdat, S4, Ep4).</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep7 How to Fail: Nesrine Malik | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150181/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150181/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on the podcast, I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to welcome the brilliant Nesrine Malik, a British-Sudanese writer and newspaper columnist who has recently been longlisted for the prestigious Orwell Prize and whose forthcoming book, We Need New Stories, is a riveting assault on our tired old ideologies. (She&amp;rsquo;s also really funny, by the way.)
Nesrine joins me to talk about the not-so-terrible-yet-somehow-devastating shame of not getting the A-grade she was predicted in her GCSE English (a failure so personal, she has never told anyone about it), why she&amp;rsquo;s never grown out of &amp;lsquo;mommy and daddy issues&amp;rsquo; and why she finds it difficult to put down roots anywhere.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep6 How to Fail: Andy McNab | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150182/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150182/</guid><description>Podcast Description You could say that my guest this week became famous because of failure. Andy McNab led the Bravo Two Zero SAS mission during the first Gulf War but his team was compromised soon after they were dropped into Iraq in 1991. This was the most horrific kind of failure. It resulted in the deaths of three of the squad, a cat-and-mouse chase across the desert and McNab&amp;rsquo;s eventual capture.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep5 How to Fail: Charly Cox | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150183/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150183/</guid><description>Podcast Description I have my FIRST POET on the podcast this week - and my, what a poet. Charly Cox is not only a beautiful soul but a beautiful chronicler of what it is to be human. Her first collection, She Must Be Mad, became the bestselling poetry debut of 2018 and Cox was named by Elle magazine as one of their 20 ‘power players’ of the year.
Although still only 23, she&amp;rsquo;s accumulated an astonishing store of wisdom and I was so, so happy to have her on the podcast because what Charly has to say is deeply important for anyone struggling with how to value themselves for who and what they are rather than how they aspire to be perceived.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep4 How to Fail: Mo Gawdat | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150184/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150184/</guid><description>Podcast Description Just occasionally in life, you meet someone who changes your way of thinking about the world. The shift might be subtle or it might be seismic, but afterwards, you are never quite the same again.
This is what happened to me when my path crossed with that of Mo Gawdat who spoke to me about what it is to live a contented life in a way that had an immediate and practical impact on my outlook.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep3 How to Fail: Tracey Thorn | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150185/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150185/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest this week is the fantastic Tracey Thorn, who I basically grew up listening to. She was one-half of Everything But The Girl, guest vocalist on Massive Attack&amp;rsquo;s phenomenal Protection album and lately has launched her own solo career alongside writing three critically acclaimed memoirs, the latest of which, Another Planet: A Teenager in Suburbia has won rave plaudits from Julie Burchill, David Nicholls and Dolly Alderton, to name but a few.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep2 How to Fail: John Crace | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150186/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 07:45:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150186/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest this week is John Crace, one of our foremost journalists and critics. Probably best known for his role at the Guardian as parliamentary sketch-writer (it was he who famously coined the term ‘Maybot’ to describe our besieged Prime Minister’s rather…um…mechanical response to crisis) and as the author of the brilliant Digested Read column, which takes the book of the moment and distils it into a hysterically funny parody.</description></item><item><title>S4, Ep1 How to Fail: Vicky McClure | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150187/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 06:46:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150187/</guid><description>Podcast Description We’re baaaaaack! And to celebrate our fourth season, please welcome the one, the only, VICKY MCCLURE.
You’re in for a treat with this one. Vicky is not only one of my favourite actresses but also one of my favourite people, as genuine as she is talented, and a total delight to interview. She’s probably most famous for her role as police officer Kate Fleming in Line of Duty, which kicked off again in spectacular style on Sunday night (did you watch the first episode?</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep9 How to Fail: Haemin Sunim | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150188/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150188/</guid><description>Podcast Description Sniff. Sob. Wail and gnashing of teeth. Yes, it’s the SEASON THREE FINALE already - how did that happen? For our final episode in this series, I had the great privilege of talking to Haemin Sunim, one of the most influential Zen Buddhist teachers in the world.
He is a Korean ‘super-monk’ - so-called because he has over one million followers on Twitter and because his books have become instant global bestsellers.</description></item><item><title>S3 BONUS EPISODE How to Fail: Kristen Roupenian | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150189/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150189/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ahead of next week&amp;rsquo;s season finale, I offer you, my wonderful listeners, a whole new BONUS EPISODE.
I know, I&amp;rsquo;m too good to you, I really am.
No, but honestly, thank you so much for your continued support - for all those lovely messages, ratings and reviews. I appreciate it so, so much. Here, by way of a thank you is the amazing Kristen Roupenian, author of the viral short story sensation Cat Person, and an all-round brilliant woman who has such interesting things to say about failure.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep8 How to Fail: Pandora Sykes | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150190/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150190/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week I get to interview one of my favourite fellow podcasters: Pandora Sykes is a journalist, co-host of The High Low and all-round woman of impeccable taste (I mean, she must be to have agreed to come on How To Fail, right?) Sykes is also a contributing editor at Man Repeller and Elle magazine and writes regularly for other publications. Her High Low co-host, Dolly Alderton, is a former How To Fail guest and - fun fact - Dolly&amp;rsquo;s episode is the most downloaded OF ALL TIME.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep7 How to Fail: Sharmaine Lovegrove | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150191/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150191/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, my guest is the brilliant Sharmaine Lovegrove. Sharmaine is a champion of stories. As a publisher, she heads up her own imprint, Dialogue Books, at Little, Brown and has been instrumental in bringing more diverse voices into print.
But Sharmaine is also one of the most dynamic and inspiring women I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of meeting. This is a woman who survived a challenging childhood and ended up living on the streets while studying for her A-Levels.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep6 How to Fail: James O'Brien | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150192/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150192/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today&amp;rsquo;s guest is quite possibly one of the most intimidating people to interview given his own reputation as a fearsome interrogator. But fine, I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go. James O&amp;rsquo;Brien is an LBC radio presenter who hosts a daily phone-in discussion show which attracts a million listeners a week. Clips of him dismantling the ignorance and prejudice of politicians, bigots and racists with his customary cool, hard logic have gone viral on more than one occasion.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep 5 How to Fail: Raven Smith | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150193/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150193/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week my guest is Raven Smith who, as well as having one of the best names dot dot dot EVER is also the funniest man on Instagram (it&amp;rsquo;s true, don&amp;rsquo;t @ me). Smith is a columnist for British Vogue, a guest lecturer at Central Saint Martins and is currently working on his first book: Raven Smith’s Trivial Pursuits, a guide to modern life which covers everything from Ikea meatballs to Ant &amp;amp; Dec and which promises to be just as funny and irreverent as the man himself.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep4 How to Fail: Deborah Frances-White | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150194/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150194/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest this week is Deborah Frances-White: an award-winning stand-up comedian, author and quite possibly the defining feminist of our generation. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably know her from her hit podcast, The Guilty Feminist, or from her book of the same name and if you don&amp;rsquo;t then WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING, WHERE?
Deborah joins me to talk about failure at improvisation, failure to be a biological mother and how to rebuild your life after leaving the Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses.</description></item><item><title>S3; Ep3 How to Fail: Jonny Benjamin | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150195/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150195/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ok, so full disclosure: I cried during this interview. You will quite possibly cry too. You will quite possibly need a box of tissues next to you as you listen. And you will quite possibly leave feeling enlightened and uplifted by the magical, gorgeous man that is Jonny Benjamin, MBE.
Jonny is a mental health campaigner and someone with a truly extraordinary story to tell. In 2008, Jonny was 20 and standing on the edge of Waterloo Bridge about to jump.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep2 How to Fail: Chris Patten | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150196/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150196/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, my guest is the former politician Chris Patten. It&amp;rsquo;s almost easier to list the high-powered offices of state he hasn&amp;rsquo;t occupied than the ones he has. Patten was the 28th governor of Hong Kong, the former Chairman of the BBC, the current Chancellor of Oxford University. For 13 years, he was the Conservative MP for Bath before losing his seat in the 1992 election - one of the incidences of failure he discusses on this episode.</description></item><item><title>S3, Ep1 How to Fail: Lily Allen | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150197/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150197/</guid><description>Podcast Description Haaaappy New Year! We&amp;rsquo;re back with a whole new season and we open with a bona fide musical superstar: Lily Allen.
A singer, songwriter, the recipient of multiple awards, Lily&amp;rsquo;s songs such as Smile and The Fear are observationally crafted with honesty and irreverent wit. In 2018, she was nominated for a Mercury Prize for her (brilliant) fourth album, No Shame, and published her memoir, My Thoughts Exactly, which was a Sunday Times Number 1 bestseller.</description></item><item><title>How to Fail: End of Season Two | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150198/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 08:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150198/</guid><description>Podcast Description So here we are at the end of SEASON TWO of How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, 16 wonderful interviews (and untold numbers of pots of babaganoush) later. In order to mark this momentous occasion, I speak to the legend behind the microphone, the one and only Chris Sharp, producer extraordinaire. We chat about our favourite moments of the podcast so far and discuss the most memorable building work we&amp;rsquo;ve had to contend with along the way (it&amp;rsquo;s a nightmare for the sound quality, apparently).</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep8 How to Fail: David Baddiel | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150199/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150199/</guid><description>Podcast Description For the season two finale of How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, I speak to David Baddiel: comedian, author and co-writer of the best unofficial football anthem of all time (Three Lions, people). It was an interview that almost didn&amp;rsquo;t happen because of his FAILURE to find a parking space near my flat. But we ended up piling into his Audi and driving to his house instead, so it all worked out in the end.</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep7 How to Fail: Tara Westover | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150200/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150200/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, I bring you a truly incredible woman. Her name is Tara Westover. She wrote a memoir called Educated, which is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read: profound, moving, unerringly original. It tells the story of Westover&amp;rsquo;s upbringing, born the seventh child of Mormon survivalist parents who didn&amp;rsquo;t believe in public schooling or mainstream medicine.

In person, she does not disappoint. We talk about the curse of perfectionism, the notion of having-it-all (ish) and Farrah&amp;rsquo;s decision to be a child-free woman. We also cover her failures as a child carol singer (and why she still can&amp;rsquo;t face doing karaoke because of it), being rejected from the university of her dreams, disordered eating, failing at a job she&amp;rsquo;d wanted for ages and failing at a blind date with the man who later became her husband.</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep5 How to Fail: Alastair Campbell | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150202/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150202/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week How To Fail With Elizabeth Day welcomes Alastair Campbell to the confessional booth. The former spin doctor to Tony Blair (and inspiration for the character of foul-mouthed Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It) talks movingly about his mental health breakdown in 1986, and how that changed the course of his life. He also discusses living with depression, admitting to an alcohol problem, almost crying on live TV and playing the bagpipes (not all at the same time).</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep4 How to Fail: Otegha Uwagba | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150203/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150203/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week my guest is writer, podcaster and all-round megawatt woman, Otegha Uwagba. Otegha joins me to talk about her failures at getting a job, dealing with sexism at work, living with depression and why she just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to help being petty on Twitter (her words). We also discuss racism and how she handles daily micro-aggressions: &amp;lsquo;I’m so conscious to be overly polite if I encounter a sort of older white person lest they then leave with a bad impression of black people generally,&amp;rsquo; Otegha says.</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep3 How to Fail: James Frey | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150204/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150204/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, we&amp;rsquo;re joined by the author James Frey who also just so happens to be my first American guest (hello, USA! I heart you!). Frey has written four critically acclaimed novels, and his fifth - Katerina, a sweeping love story set between 2018 Los Angeles and 1992 Paris - has just been published.
But he&amp;rsquo;s probably as well known for his notoriety as his talent.</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep2 How to Fail: Mishal Husain | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150205/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150205/</guid><description>Podcast Description The wonderful Mishal Husain joins How To Fail With Elizabeth Day this week, which I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about because she&amp;rsquo;s basically my long-time woman crush.
Husain, who has been presenting Radio 4’s flagship Today programme since 2013 and is also one of our most recognisable and respected television broadcasters, joins me to talk about failing at university admissions, failing to get what she thought was her dream job, failing to ask the right questions in interviews and beating herself up about it afterwards.</description></item><item><title>S2, Ep1 How to Fail: Jessie Burton | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150206/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150206/</guid><description>Podcast Description We&amp;rsquo;re BACK!

Which means I’m currently writing shownotes about myself in the third person. Which is weird. Let me stop doing that.
Over the course of the last eight weeks, I’ve been lucky enough to interview some truly wonderful, interesting, successful people, all of whom have opened up to me and made themselves vulnerable by discussing the place failure occupies in their lives.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep7 How to Fail: David Nicholls | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150209/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150209/</guid><description>Podcast Description David Nicholls, bestselling novelist, critically acclaimed screenwriter, aspiring piano player and thoroughly nice man, joins How To Fail to talk about his myriad failures. You might not expect the author of One Day, which sold five million copies and was adapted into a film starring Anne Hathaway, to have much of an acquaintance with failure, but Nicholls insists there’s plenty to discuss. We touch on his failure to be an actor for 10 years (he was always the understudy; never the main part), the anxiety that comes with success, the challenges and beauty of fatherhood and his failure to drive a car competently above 40 miles per hour.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep6 How to Fail: Gina Miller | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150210/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150210/</guid><description>Podcast Description Political activist Gina Miller is best known for one major victory when she successfully took the government to court over the triggering of Article 50 to leave the European Union. But in this week’s How To Fail, she discusses the failures that led her to that point. In a frank and honest conversation with host Elizabeth Day, Gina talks about failing to graduate from law school, surviving an abusive marriage, raising a daughter with special needs and building up her emotional resilience so that when it came to the crunch, she was able to find the strength to take a stand for what she believed in.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep5 How to Fail: Olivia Laing | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150211/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150211/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on How To Fail, we’re joined by the brilliant writer Olivia Laing. Her three critically-acclaimed works of non-fiction, To The River, The Trip to Echo Spring and The Lonely City, have explored themes of alcoholism, loneliness and suicide (and yet somehow manage to be deeply uplifting to read). Her recent debut novel, Crudo, has everyone from Jilly Cooper to Viv Albertine in veritable ecstasies. Olivia talks to us about losing her way in her 20s, how the torture of romantic break-ups has ultimately led to some of her greatest creative work and about what it’s like to be made redundant from a job you love.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep4 How to Fail: Sathnam Sanghera | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150212/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150212/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, journalist and author Sathnam Sanghera joins How To Fail and kicks off by saying how flattered he was to be asked to contribute to a podcast on failure because he hates hearing nice things said about himself. So that’s good.
As well as discussing his failure to take a compliment, Sathnam talks movingly about growing up in a household where both his father and his sister had schizophrenia.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep3 How to Fail: Dolly Alderton | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150213/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150213/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week’s guest on How To Fail with Elizabeth Day is memoirist, podcaster and journalist Dolly Alderton. Dolly, the co-host of the utterly fantastic The High Low podcast and author of the brilliant Sunday Times bestseller Everything I Know About Love, talks about being rejected from Bristol University (and still feeling resentful of anyone she meets who went there), being ‘compassionately’ fired from a job she didn’t really want and what happens when you don’t meet the love of your life, even when you think you’re going to.</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep2 How to Fail: Sebastian Faulks | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150214/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150214/</guid><description>Podcast Description Sebastian Faulks, bestselling novelist and author of Birdsong and Charlotte Gray, joins How To Fail to talk about his failure to win the Booker Prize (“the whole thing is absolutely ridiculous”), his sense of social isolation at boarding school and a period of depression at university he feels he has never fully recovered from. Along the way, he talks about what it really means to be a “successful” writer and whether it matters what other people think, as well as the time he failed his driving test and got bowled out having scored 98 at cricket (two separate occasions, thankfully).</description></item><item><title>S1, Ep1 How To Fail - Phoebe Waller-Bridge | How To Fail With Elizabeth Day</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6782150215/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 08:22:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6782150215/</guid><description>Podcast Description Phoebe Waller-Bridge, creator and star of Fleabag, writer of Killing Eve, superstar feminist and human embodiment of a Star Wars droid, joins How To Fail to talk about how she failed at her 20s (but got lots of brilliant material from the terrible dates she endured), failing at drama school, terrible auditions (including one for Downton Abbey) and how her female best friend is quite possibly the love of her life.</description></item></channel></rss>
