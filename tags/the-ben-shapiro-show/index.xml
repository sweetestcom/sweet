        <title>Facts Ep. 7: You Should Be Worried About The Pink Wave | The Ben Shapiro Show</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/1778342206/</link>

        <description>Podcast Description The “pink wave” is a term that refers to a political tide that leans towards left-wing governments, specifically in Latin America throughout the 21st century. It’s time for Latin Americans to recognize that the true threat to their futures comes not from the conservative right and free-market economics, but from the would-be socialists who have consigned their countries to under-development and suffering. The recent election of Javier Milei in Argentina is one of the first steps in this understanding, and hopefully, it won’t be the last.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Our guest, Jair Bolsonaro, is the current president of Brazil and is up for reelection at the end of October. President Bolsonaro has taken militantly conservative positions and targeted the country&amp;rsquo;s corruption in allegedly controversial ways: killing government programs, opening up gun availability for law-abiding citizens, harsher treatment of criminals, and opening up more economic development in areas prized by environmentalists. He has been slandered as a facist, a dictator, and an authoritarian; but, his agenda of more assertive force to cut crime and promote traditional family values has made him hugely popular with Brazilians.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Based on a single tweet crying transphobia, Target pulled a book from their shelves nationwide. Abigail Shrier, the author of that book, joins the show today. “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters” explores the alarming new trend of teens self-diagnosing themselves with rapid onset gender dysphoria. A condition that was relatively rare and generally only seen among young boys, has now skyrocketed in young girls. The problem wouldn’t be as profound, however, if it weren’t for the medical, scientific, and education establishment that has completely surrendered to woke activists, and now actively enable and encourage young people to irreversibly damage their bodies and compromise their futures.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Will this showdown be the cakewalk for Trump that many predict? Did Biden use the vast amount of time he’s spent avoiding the press to actually debate prep or was he just napping? Do Trump’s tax returns or Hunter Biden’s shady Russian dealings have any real effect on persuading voters? Is there any chance Joe will show up to all three debates?
Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.</description>
