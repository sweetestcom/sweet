Today we have a quote!
“Holding back is so close to stealing.” – Neil Young
To hold back means to withhold or to not do something or to not give something.
This episode is about taking chances in our lives.
You may feel like you can’t be yourself in English.
Maybe you are funny in your native language but you don’t know how to be funny in English so you hold back.</description>

Do you think it’s important to obsess over something to become successful at it?
Another way to say it is ” to have tunnel vision.”
Another word for obsession could be “focus” but it has more of a positive connotation.
When we get really focused we have to be careful of burnout.
We could get exhausted.
When it comes to learning English you should chunk down the learning into bite-sized pieces and be sure that you are learning in a way that is fun for you.</description>
