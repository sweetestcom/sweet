        <description>Podcast Description In today’s episode, Vic goes head-to-head with Alison George, our very clever and succinct friend at Australian Ethical. If you’ve listened to this podcast before, you’ll no doubt be aware of Vic’s undying love for Microsoft in all its nerdy-tech glory … so naturally, we’ve put her on the ‘against’ side of today’s ethical investment debate. From the risks of facial recognition to carbon neutral data centres, increased productivity to who’s responsible for the recycling, we dive deep into the highs and lows of investing in this multi-(multi)-billion-dollar company.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week, we’re rolling out a slightly different format. With 2023 nearly behind us, we’re wrapping up the year that’s been and all the lessons it has given us. From learning to live with significantly less to taking your own advice, from the importance of a healthy emergency fund to the heartbreaking realities of the ADHD tax – we’re here to reflect and share (and we’re actually quite vulnerable).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ahhh, December. The trees are up, the carols are cranking, and things are looking rather bright and merry in the world of finance – unless, of course, you’re Michael Burry (the man behind The Big Short – it has Ryan Gosling in it, you’ve probably seen it). Today, we’re talking big risks, big bets and the danger of betting on failure. On a more positive note, the S&amp;amp;P500 is up, Uber’s finally in the big-dog club, Facebook is flying, Zuckerberg’s selling, TikTok is absolutely massive and Vic’s hit travel gold (for only 35 measly little Euros).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Child actor, teenage homeowner, Shortland Street star and mum-of-three … it’s safe to say that Beth Allen (Google her face immediately, you know her) has lived a pretty exciting life. Today, we have the privilege of sitting down with Beth to talk about her own financial journey, and the importance of keeping her finances aligned with her ethics. From industry pay disparities to the cost of being a woman on screen, investing her kids’ pocket money to Elon Musk’s big plans for Mars, Beth’s here to tell it like it is.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A big week for The Curve! Soph went to the movies (and ordered nachos – questionable), Vic discovered Temu and we won a podcast award! Morale could not be higher, and neither could the latest Black Friday stats. We look at the sky-high spending, massive profits and a few scary red flags. We’re also talking the joy of black cabs, the (third) return of Robin Hood, Soph’s saucy Christmas costume and this summer’s hottest fashion trend – the IPO.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We’re always excited to chat to our guests, but this week Soph has quite possibly lost her mind in anticipation. To celebrate the recent Transgender Awareness Week, we’re talking to the hilarious, honest and totally inspiring Allegra Bambi Haines. Born and raised in South Wales, in an idyllic (and very sheltered) community, Allegra’s journey from uncertain child to proud trans-woman has not been an easy one. From her traumatic ‘lightbulb moment’ at 21 to being struck off the NHS waiting list, from estrogen on toast to funding the renovation that never ends – Allegra takes us, graciously and wittily, through the real cost of transitioning.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description AI scandals, dirty crypto and weeping at Singapore Airport … safe to say, it’s been a wild old week for all involved. While Vic finally touched down on safe ground (yes, the weeping was hers) the same can’t be said for the big dogs behind ChatGPT, who are currently dealing with a veeery shaky landing. We talk about riding the AI wave, the inevitability of greed following success, and the beauty of investing in an ETF.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For so many, fertility doesn’t come easy. In fact, it can come at a huge, overwhelming and often unattainable cost. In today’s episode, we’re talking to Brett Russo, author of ‘The Underwear in my Shoe’ – a powerful, funny and unflinchingly honest account of her journey through IVF – about her own experience with infertility. Born and raised in New Jersey, Brett and her husband endured five rounds of IVF to have their two gorgeous sons.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We all know Vic loves a party … so to celebrate her birthday week, Soph’s bringing the party to this episode! We’re talking messages of love, a few dirty secrets and one very sexy bunch of flowers. And because this is a finance podcast, we’ve also found time to cover WeWork’s ongoing bankruptcy saga (and why it may actually make them more powerful), the widening gap between men and women, why Amazon’s getting into bed with Snapchat, and the scandalous rise of ‘shrink-flation’ (we’re looking at you, Dirk).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you’re looking for amazing energy, absolute honesty and a big old mindset-shift – then have we got the episode for you. Today’s guest, Chancè Hindirlane, is a trailblazer, a boss and a genuine breath of fresh air. Originally from Congo, Chancè and her 11 siblings were raised by their mother – and a village of support people. After moving to America and having her first child, she quickly realised that not only was finding her own village incredibly tough – it also came at a huge financial cost.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When a founder steps down, usually so does the share price. And this week, Whitney Wolfe Herd – founder and CEO of Bumble, and the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire – is calling it quits. We talk about plummeting share prices, the cost of love and the benefits of having a founder in the driver’s seat. We’re also looking at some Shein IPO rumours, Buffy the Finance Slayer’s savings account (Vic&#39;s attempt at a Warren Buffet joke), Uber’s latest offering (hot air balloon, anyone?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Here at The Curve, we love ourselves a good debate – and today’s guest, Lily from Pathfinder, is an incredible (and very succinct) contender. We’re partnering with Pathfinder on a brand-new ethical miniseries – and to kick things off, we’re going right to the core of one of the juiciest names in the business. Apple. With Lily fighting in Apple’s corner, and Vic doing her best to pick it apart, we go deep into Apple’s operations to find out how many problems the world’s largest tech-giant is solving … and causing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The S&amp;amp;P500’s had a big bad month, but it’s not all doom and gloom! We look at the realities of over performing and why all that goes up must, at some point, come down. And when it comes to going down, we couldn’t go past WeWork’s recent bankruptcy saga and the tough choice investors will face between getting the hell out or keeping the faith. We look at the surprising success of Pinterest, the public perils of IPOs, and dive under the coyote-fur hood of Canada Goose … and Vic gives herself a new nickname.</description>

We’re talking Snapchat’s highs and lows, Meta’s latest (and potentially very expensive) controversy and Hong Kong’s not-very-sexy problem – as well as the impact the Israel-Palestine war is having on advertising revenue, and Microsoft’s epic commitment to looking after women going through menopause.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s World Investor Week! To celebrate we’re partnering with the FMA (the investing-police) to share a really important (and interesting, we promise) episode about ethical investing. While some people are in this game for the big bucks alone, others want to channel their money into companies they believe in. Or, at the very least, companies that aren’t actively damaging our planet or the people on it. It’s a complex topic, full of personal preferences and endless balancing acts, but we’ve come up with a way to keep things simple and streamlined (spoiler: it’s a cute little pyramid).</description>

Despite the ongoing struggles of the cozzie-livs, a few big names are doing ok for themselves. Things are going strong for Costco and its recession-proof stock, Nike’s recent reporting led to a big sporty jump in their shares, and everything Taylor Swift touches is still turning to gold. We also talk about the lasting effects of reputational damage and why Soph will never eat a McCain’s pizza again, and dangle the old carrot for our exciting new project.</description>

Roxie battled with addiction in her 20&#39;s and then fell pregnant to someone she barely knew.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description TRIGGER WARNING: hysterectomy. Today’s episode is an exploration on the financial cost of being a woman, thanks to Eve Wellness. For 1/9 women, Endometriosis costs not only a huge amount financially, but also physically, mentally and emotionally. Bree Tomalson from the ZM drive show, and Erin Alysha Barnett from Love Island were kind enough to open up to us about the reality of living with this condition. In this ep we hear about blood clots on a desert island and what it’s like to suddenly have no uterus (and also what it might mean to have more than one uterus in a relationship!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you’re anything like us, when you hear the word ‘retirement’, your mind goes straight to the rest home: long lonely days, wiry greys, and endless games of bingo. But the reality is, retirement can actually be a massively exciting time (if you’re prepped and ready for it, which you will be after this episode). Alongside giving retirement the hot new look it deserves, we discuss how much you may need (and how to get there), balancing experiencing today with saving for tomorrow, the mind-blowing beauty of compound interest, and the joys of an adult star-chart.</description>

These companies are so familiar to us that we can forget that they profit from our everyday purchases, and we can invest in them on the stock market too! In this episode, Vic &amp;amp; Soph discuss how buying stocks in companies we already know about can reduce the complexity of investing. And Vic, (being a little too familiar with one of these credit card companies 💸), gives us the market low down on the three biggest names in the payments industry.</description>

His prenup. In today’s episode, we do a deep dive into the world of prenups with New York’s finest: the brilliantly bad-ass lawyer to the stars, Stephanie Lehman. We discuss the value of ‘women’s work’, the importance of looking ahead, and how to make that prenup conversation a little bit sexier (spoiler alert: it involves wine, dinner and a whole lot of nudity).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An inspiring and incredibly important conversation with Te Kahukura AKA The Māori Millionaire. At just 8 years old she read the iconic investing book &#39;Richer Dad Poorer Dad&#39;, and at 19 she has $45,170 worth of assets! She is incredibly clued up with growing her own wealth and is on a mission to empower others to do the same. In this podcast we talk about the flow on effects that colonisation has had on the Māori population, and the importance of understanding why that wealth imbalance is so prevalent here in Aotearoa.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Soph loved this episode - she learnt (and laughed) lots. Vic talks about the future of retailing + how investing has nothing to do with maths (she always has to use a calculator). She explains why the market had its worst week this year, and how you shouldn’t stress if you miss out on shares when a company goes to market for the first time (and does really well) - Beyond Meat is a good example of why.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode we talk about Soph&#39;s big money goal of wanting to buy a new car. It&#39;s been something she&#39;s wanted for years, but felt too embarrassed to admit it. She also had NO idea how to get there, so when Audi got in touch and said that they were keen to help, we both screamed like excited 6 year olds. If you want to save for something big, but it feels outlandishly out of reach then this episode is a must listen.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Auto investing, also known as dollar cost averaging is a tactic that Vic, and many famous investors swear by. A good way to think about DCA is essentially auto investing - just like how you set up an automatic payment for rent each week. It&#39;s figuring out how much you can put aside (in advance), and making sure that the money goes into your investments - opposed to spending it on food or clothes!</description>

Traditionally referred to as &#39;Dividend Kings&#39; (note: as of now we have re-coined the term &#39;Dividend Queens&#39; for obvious reasons) are very stable, reliable companies. Dividend stocks are companies often held my investors with a shorter time to keep their money invested, but they can also be a great way to diversify if your portfolio has some more risky holdings.</description>
