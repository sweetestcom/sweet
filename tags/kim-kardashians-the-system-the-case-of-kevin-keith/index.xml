I was driving down the street and I was taking my kids to a drive thru Starbucks on Topanga. And at the gas station on the left, there was a man being arrested, handcuffed and like, thrown on the front of his car being handcuffed.

In the months leading up to the Bucyrus estates murders, there was a pharmacy burglary ring operating in Ohio. Pharmacies were being broken into and the stolen drugs were being sold.</description>
