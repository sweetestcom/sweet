        <description>Podcast Description On March 19, 1960, Kansas City police were called to the home James and Sharon Kinne for what they believed was an accidental shooting. According to Sharon, she had found their two-year-old daughter lying on the couple’s bed, a gun near her hand and her father’s body next to her with a large hole in his head. Unable to find evidence to the contrary, the shooting was ruled an accident and Sharon collected on her husband’s life insurance policy.</description>

Once they’d arrived, however, officers discovered Ocey’s body in an upstairs bathtub, dead from what appeared to be suicide by drowning.
After just a few weeks of investigation, it became clear that Ocey’s death was no accident.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On June 22, 1932, a boy picking blackberries in rural Logan, West Virginia made a hideous discovery when he happened upon the dead and brutalized body of local woman, Mamie Thurman. At first glance, Mamie’s murder resembled a gangland-style execution; she had been shot twice in the head and her throat had been slit from one side to the other, as though whoever killed her wanted to make sure she didn’t survive.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Discovered in Utah County in 1960, Nutty Putty Cave quickly became a popular destination for amateur and professional cavers and spelunkers as a kind of bucket list cave of considerable difficulty. Despite its popularity, beginning in the late 1980s, the cave became notorious for the number of explorers who became trapped and required emergency assistance to escape its twisting, narrow, and poorly mapped passageways.
In late November 2009, the inherent risk and dangers of Nutty Putty Cave made national news when twenty-six-year-old college student John Edward Jones became trapped upside-down in an uncharted and perilously narrow section of the cave.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When it comes to the horrors of witch hunts and trials around the world, Sweden is not often cited as one of the more aggressive or egregious nations. Nevertheless, the Torsåker Witch Trials remain a shocking example of religious hysteria due to the way in which they unfolded, which included local leaders defying the Swedish Crown and taking it upon themselves to identify, try, and execute supposed witches without proper authority.</description>

Instead, Farrant kicked off a moral panic over vampires, ghosts, and all manner of occult activities that featured prominently in the pages of British newspapers for years.&amp;nbsp;
Farrant’s letter received a few responses from others who claimed to have had their own supernatural experiences in Highgate Cemetery, but the story would likely have ended there had it not been for Sean Manchester.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Just before midnight on December 29, 1972, Eastern Air Lines Flight 401, traveling from New York to Miami, crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing nearly two thirds of the passengers on board. Crashing into the swamp softened the landing and likely saved dozens, but the remote location made rescue efforts complicated and required a cooperative effort between first responders and local civilians.
The crash came at a difficult time for the airline industry, following closely on a number of several high-profile hijackings and examples of equipment malfunctions that negatively affected ticket sales.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the depths of American history there are few examples of mass hysteria that loom larger than the Salem witch trials of 1692. As horrific as it was, it was far from the only example of witch-hunting in Massachusetts’ history. In fact, ten years before hysteria over black magic gripped the village of Salem, similar accusations of witchcraft were aimed at Mary Webster of Hadley, a small village in Western Massachusetts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On August 6, 1978, the body of thirty-five-year-old bar owner Jack Tupper was found in a vacant lot in the Bronx, just across the street from the local firehouse. His face had been severely slashed, his head and body badly beaten, he had been shot seven times, and finally, he had been set on fire. Witnesses reported seeing a small group of men in the lot attempting to set fire to a box earlier that day, including three witnesses who identified former racehorse trainer Howard “Buddy” Jacobson as one of the men, and one who was able to provide detectives with the license plate number of the car they were driving.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On the morning of December 31, 1946, nineteen-year-old Pearl Lusk boarded a crowded subway train in Brooklyn. A few days earlier, she’d met a man named Allen in a bar who offered her a very strange, yet simple job: she was to follow a young woman named Olga and take a photo to determine whether she was wearing any stolen jewelry.&amp;nbsp;
That morning, as Pearl and Olga exited the crowded subway train, Pearl raised the camera in Olga’s direction and pulled the wire to take a photo, but what happened next would put into motion a series of events that rivals fiction.</description>

Later, once they were safely away from the old Victorian, Gonzalez and Otero would explain to friends and family that they had been driven out by angry ghosts who had done everything—including possessing Lillian—in order to torment them, leaving them no other options than to abandon the house that had once held such promise.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On March 15, 1895, thirty-five-year-old Michael Cleary murdered his wife, twenty-six-year-old Bridget Cleary in their home in Ballyvadlea, County Tipperary. While terrible, the murder was just the last act in a series of bizarre atrocities committed against Bridget, whom her husband would later claim had been taken by malevolent fairy folk and replaced with a changeling.
More shocking, however, was that the barbaric act hadn’t been committed by one man alone, but by a group of rural men, including family.</description>

Five days later, Santomero and Durian’s bodies were discovered in the woods in West Virginia, shot to death just hours before being found, and Johndrow was nowhere to be seen.
More than a decade after their bodies were discovered, police in West Virginia had identified several suspects and eventually charged thirty-four-year-old farmer Jacob Beard, who was convicted in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description American neurologist Walter Jackson Freeman had refined Moniz’s procedure and developed a non-surgical procedure that could be performed in a doctor’s office, which he called a transorbital lobotomy.&amp;nbsp;
Freeman’s procedure involved inserting a medical instrument similar to an icepick into the patient’s orbital socket to sever the neural connections, without requiring surgery, hospital stays, and long recovery times. Touted as a quick, easy, and painless solution to everything from general malaise and occasional depression to schizophrenia and aggressive behavior, the procedure a go-to solution for the very complex psychological problems that have affected countless people for centuries.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz developed the lobotomy in 1935, it was little more than a crude surgery developed as a blanket treatment for mental illness that involved drilling into the skull and scrambling the neural connections in the frontal lobe. Less than a decade later, however, American neurologist Walter Jackson Freeman had refined Moniz’s procedure and developed a non-surgical procedure that could be performed in a doctor’s office, which he called a transorbital lobotomy.</description>

For two years Corbin denied any involvement in the deaths, insisting both women had killed themselves. Then, just days before his trial was to begin, he shocked everyone by pleading guilty to both murders in exchange for two life sentences with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.</description>

Michele’s mother, Jeanne Laundy, agreed, and she had a pretty good idea of who would have wanted to kill her daughter: Michele’s ex-husband, Lloyd Neurauter.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Boston police arrested Dr. Henry Howard Holmes in a West End boarding house on November 17, 1894, they assumed they had apprehended an interstate criminal guilty of defrauding the Fidelity Insurance company of $10,000 and of being a horse thief in Texas. Holmes had been tracked to New England by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, who had suspected him of other crimes in various cities across the country; yet even the most seasoned and creative detective couldn’t have imagined the horrific scope and magnitude of crimes he’d committed.</description>

But was it? A year later, a harrowing 911 call from 14 year old Thad Phillips would bring to light a monster in the boys&#39; own neighborhood, one that would change the ruling in Chris Steiner&#39;s death and horrify the community forever.</description>

Upon entering the home, officers discovered the bodies of Cody, Chad, and Margaret Amato, all dead from apparent gunshot wounds—there were no signs of a break-in and nothing was missing. The crime scene looked as though it had been staged to look like a murder-suicide and suspicion quickly fell on the Amato’s youngest son, Grant, who was missing from the home.</description>

For Betty, death seemed the only way to free herself from the losing battle she had been fighting; however, despite her commitment to ending her life, Betty simply didn’t have what she described as “the fortitude necessary” to go through with it.</description>

More and more evidence headquarters were set up across various areas only leading to important information being completely looked over. Peter was also spoken to several more times, but really why was he? The investigators didn&#39;t even check up on his alibis.</description>

Immediately, suspicion was placed on Florence and many wondered whether James had actually succumbed to some kind of illness, or if it was Florence that was behind the sudden death.</description>

You may have heard of the club kids, some famous examples today are Bjork, Amanda Lepore, and Ru Paul. They ruled the streets of Manhattan when the streetlights came on and partied the night away. Michael would throw these elaborate parties with crazy performers, wild themes and loads of drugs but it wouldn’t take long for the Club Kid scene to come crashing down to the ground.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Jack the Ripper part 4 is here weirdos! This installment will cover the horrific, and most brutal murder yet: the murder of Mary Jane Kelly.

        <description>Podcast Description Jack the Ripper Part three will cover what is known as, “the double event.” Both Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were found killed on this September night. Both women shared a lot in common with the previous two victims. They’d struggled through pretty much their entire lives just to make ends meet and then were met with this as their end. In this part we’ll start to entertain the theory that Jack perhaps had some kind of medical background and you’ll see just why one might think so once you dive into the episode!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Jack the Ripper part two brings us the absolutely horrifying murder of Annie Chapman. Annie’s story, much like the rest of the women who were killed, is incredibly devastating. She was struggling with sobriety when she landed on the shady streets in Spitalfields in the East end and was having a terrible time trying to find work to just get by. Robert Anderson, the head of the criminal investigations department was still on vacation, Sir Charles Warren’s ego stepped on the scene and they were not even one step closer to uncovering the culprits identity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Alaina takes us to the streets of Whitechapel for part one of Jack The Ripper, and boy is it a stark picture she’s painting us. Whitechapel was dark, damp, dirty and downright desolate at the time Jack The Ripper was roaming the streets. People were living in all kinds of horrible conditions, butchers and slaughterhouse workers were walking around covered in blood and because things were like this, it made the perfect stomping ground for a vicious murderer.</description>

The police began to look into two men after receiving a few tips and were pretty sure that they had the right guys… but did they?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The story of the Purrington murders is so horrific it sounds like something out of a movie. James Purrington seemed to have plans of killing himself after suffering from what was likely undiagnosed mental illness. When one of his children brought this to the attention of their mother and his wife, he said he had no intention of killing himself at all, just typical worries about his family after a long grueling summer and a bad drought.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is the story of Phil Hartman and the episode is a little different than some we’ve done in the past. We all know Ash loves an “Old Hollywood” kind of case, this one while not very old at all fits under the umbrella. Phil Hartman was one of the most beloved comedians of all times, often referred to as, “The Man of 1000 voices.” When you dive into his life as a whole you find all kinds of hidden gems, like the fact that Phil had a run in with Jimi Hendrix, and so many more little anecdotes like that!</description>

William’s backstory is heartbreaking, but unfortunately he did nothing to turn it around and continued the cycle of abuse, but escelated it to the nth degree.</description>

You won’t believe how botched the crime scene was and will be shocked when you hear that the person who may have done this had been lurking in the shadows the whole time.</description>

There were countless details that we didn’t realize about her or the house and through our research, we really began tearing back the layers of this story!</description>

When entire families began falling victim to its brutal clutches, it simply had to be vampires who had taken host in their loved ones ailing bodies to suck the life from the remaining members.</description>

This was definitely a hard one to get through, but is a fascinating case for sure.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode we are joined by Ronnie Karam and Ben Mandelker of the Watch What Crappens podcast, for something a bit different! Throughout the years recording Morbid we’ve come across an abundance of songs that were inspired by true crime events. We figured it would be pretty interesting to break down some of the crimes and songs with these fellas. We revisit the Moors murders to talk about The Smith’s ballad “Suffer Little Children,” reminisce on hearing Fastball’s “The Way” while having no idea that it was inspired by something dark and last but not least we dive into Neko Case’s “Deep Red Bells,” which was inspired by the Green River Killer’s victims.</description>

This case, dare we say, may be one of the wildest rides we’ve brought you along for in quite some time. Charles was really a vibe in the 60’s, at least according to the youths of the day. He would change his appearance quite drastically when he turned 18 and it was at that moment he became a hot commodity.</description>

For years no one was entirely sure what to make of the case, especially when a polaroid showed up and the woman in the photo bore a striking resemblance to Tara.</description>

It would be 8 years before anyone would get answers, and the man who gave the answers is one of the scariest people to walk the planet. As always, thank you to our sponsors:</description>

When Julia turns up dead in their home, people start taking a closer look at Wallace and his idiosyncratic tendencies.

This tale has always been such a crazy one that we just had to do it again and do it right. On December 6, 1959, respected and renowned doctor, Harold Perelson, turned his family&#39;s dream home into a nightmare when he snapped in the dead of night and left a trail of blood in his wake. This house would come to be known as the Los Feliz Murder House for a good reason.</description>

More and more people are coming forward with their experiences at ~the farm~ but no one is taking this case as seriously as they should. Huge numbers of women are going missing, but are seen as less dead or are put to the bottom of the list because of their “high risk lifestyles.” But somewhere in the middle of our story the investigation gets revamped and Scott Chubb really does his best to save the day, are you ready for the end of this?</description>

Unfortunately, she was wrong about Jared, who didn’t have even a fiber of goodness throughout him, and he was the one who took Ashley’s life in 2018.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Cinnamon Brown was 14 years old when her own father, David Brown, convinced her to carry out the murder of her stepmother, Linda Bailey Brown. Cinnamon was fully convinced and brainwashed into thinking that she wouldn’t do jail time and instead just have to see a psychiatrist. Little did she know, she’d be taken away in cuffs and sent to a California Youth Authority facility for the next 4 years while her father and his new wife cashed in on Linda’s life insurance policy and lived the good life.</description>

Tonight we talk about Oklahoma&amp;rsquo;s most massive manhunt, we discuss the mounting evidence against Gene Leroy Hart and we discuss some questionable police work that may have cost them their case in the end. Unfortunately, this case technically remains unsolved, despite many attempts to get something from the DNA evidence that was poorly stored for so many years. It&amp;rsquo;s a tragedy that hopefully will one day have some real closure.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week we’re talking about one of the most haunted objects in the world. The Dybbuk box stepped on the ebay scene in September 2001 and nothing has ever been the same. The word, “Dybbuk” comes from Jewish folklore and literally means, “to cling.” An otherworldly spirit was captured in the box during the holocaust and when Kevin Mannis bought it at an estate sale, brought it home and opened it, his life changed forever.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We finish up this spooky and mysterious case of at least 6 (definitely more) young women disappearing in an 80 mile radius in Ireland, with the disappearance of Ciara Breen, Fiona Sinnott and Deirdre Jacob. Two of these cases may have obvious answers and in this episode, we bring in a shady character who may have a lot to do with the other missing women. Larry Murphy is one of the most notorious rapists in Ireland and now, in 2020, authorities are about to close the net on him.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The conclusion of our look into the Galveston 11 (part of the Texas Killing Fields) begs the question, did Edward Bell rape and murder these girls? Are there more out there? Bell seemed to be at the wrong places at the wrong times about 98% of his miserable life if he isn&amp;rsquo;t the killer here, but Ash takes us further into his other known crimes and the last 5 murders that many attribute to his name.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the first installment of our series about The Texas Killing Fields, we focus on the 11 raped and murdered young girls referred to as the Galveston 11. In Part 1 of this case, Ash goes through Ed Bell&amp;rsquo;s tumultuous life, his confessions and the first murders. Did Ed Bell do it, or is he an Ottis Toole type who likes to involve himself in nightmares that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t present for?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s a weird, 1920&amp;rsquo;s murder involving magic, hexes and a straight up river witch. On Thanksgiving Eve in 1928, John Blymire had reached the end of his rope. He was down on his luck for the past year and he was convinced someone had hexed him. After multiple visits to witches and healers, he was told his fears were valid and that his neighbor was the one responsible for his bad luck.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Marsha P. Johnson was a pioneer for LGBTQ rights and a notable figure in the infamous Stonewall Uprising of 1969. She championed for transgender youth and gave back to her community throughout her short life. When she was found floating, dead in the Hudson River not long after the 1991 Pride parade. Her cause of death was noted as drowning but questions remain. How did she end up in the Hudson?</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360411/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Well, we have another mishandled case for you weirdos. The 2018 death of Tamla Horsford is tragic but it is also wildly suspicious. This 40 year old, mother of 5 was found face down in a back yard after attending an adult sleepover. Her injuries were varied and seemingly unexplainable for a fall from a second floor balcony. What makes this worse is the fact that this took place in Forsyth County, Georgia, a place with a documented history of racial prejudice.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In our conclusion of this extremely difficult case, we discuss Matt&amp;rsquo;s last days and the aftermath of his passing. His legacy far outreached the crime that took his life. We discuss the absurdity of the &amp;ldquo;gay panic&amp;rdquo; defense and also explain the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
We also cry. It&amp;rsquo;s a doozy.

        <description>Podcast Description If you grew up in the 90s, Matthew Shepard&amp;rsquo;s face is something that has probably stayed with you since his murder on October 6, 1998.
Matthew was lured from a bar in Laramie, Wyoming by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. Their intent was to pose as gay men and rob Matthew. What occurred was much more than robbery. They used a .357 magnum revolver to beat him to death, tying him to a buck fence and leaving him to die for 18 hours in the freezing Wyoming cold.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This case is baffling and seems like it deserves a second look. 19 year old Kenneka Jenkins was found dead of exposure, in a hotel freezer (with the door latched) after attending a hotel room party that same evening. There is a trail of strange Facebook Live videos and choppy surveillance film that provide more questions than answers. Is this a terrible and tragic accident or did something more sinister happen to Kenneka?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description So for today&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mini&amp;rdquo;, Alaina thought she was going to do Spooky Roads but then Scotland just went ahead and provided a whole-ass episode worth of spooky goodness that just had to be shared. Mary King&amp;rsquo;s Close is a fascinating, terrifying and bizarre piece of Scottish history and add in the supreme darkness of Nor Loch, where murders run rampant, executions were carried out and accused witches were dunked to their deaths and you have a seriously spooky Scottish episode that will kick off our new sporadic series, Scottish Shenanigans.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What a story this is, guys. Lori Vallow&amp;rsquo;s saga is still going on and we seem to be no closer to answers than where it all started. In Part 2 of this crazy tale, we meet her husband Chad, we hear about his shady past and we wonder where the hell her children Tylee and JJ could be. Why is it that people around this couple tend to die or disappear?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Well Alaina can&amp;rsquo;t do it. She can&amp;rsquo;t stay mini and she won&amp;rsquo;t! Honestly, this was supposed to be a real mini but then I found another source and things got wild. Thanks for appreciating my lack of brevity on the regular, weirdos. This case is WILD. Zach Bowen and Addie Hall were two 20-somethings experiencing a whirlwind romance in New Orleans in the early 00s. Both had a free spirit way about them, they loved fiercely and they seemed to carve out a niche as the king and queen of the French Quarter misfits.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is a very recent and ongoing case that has baffled almost everyone who has heard of it. Lori Vallow made headlines in the end of 2019, when her two children, 17 year old Tylee and 8 year old JJ disappeared, seemingly into thin air. With reports circulating that she told witnesses stories like her children were long dead or staying with relatives who confirmed they were not, things look like they are going from bad to worse.</description>

Instead of a cure, she found a radiologist named Karl Tanzler who instantly became obsessed with her. Although the affections were one sided, when Elena passed away a couple of months later, Karl just couldn&amp;rsquo;t let his soulmate go. What he did next is unthinkable, and he never really paid a price for it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Guys, this case has plagued us for years. It is one of those cases that provides more questions than it does answers. January 10, 2013, 17 year old Kendrick Johnson was found dead, rolled up in a wrestling mat in his high school gym. Initially, the case was quickly ruled a tragic, freak accident but after three autopsies, several false leads and a myriad of unanswered questions, Kendrick&amp;rsquo;s family is no closer to finding out the truth about what happened to their son on that winter day in Georgia.</description>

Kelly Anne Bates was a 14 year old child when she met a much older Dave Smith. While her parents helplessly looked on, she slipped further and further into his grasp until finally, he snuffed her out in one of the most gruesome murders to date. During this uncertain time, we know a lot of people have found themselves quarantined in a dangerous situation, quite possibly with their abusers.</description>

Luckily, the story has as good an ending as we can hope for in a tale like this one and Jayme emerged a warrior who used her strength and wits to survive and now thrive while her abductor Jake Patterson rots for the rest of his life.</description>

Speaking with Jessica, we were able to clear up some misconceptions about her sister&amp;rsquo;s case and also hear her first hand experience as a family member of a murder victim.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Robert Ben Rhoades used his job as a long haul truck to satisfy his sexually sadistic needs. While passing through various states, he thought he could pick up a hitchhiker here or a sex worker there and no one would notice if they disappeared. He was wrong. Luckily, his reign of terror came to an end but not before he inflicted pain and suffering on countless women.

        <description>Podcast Description 17 year old Alissa Turney officially went missing May 17, 2001. Initially, she was labeled a runaway, but as evidence piled in to the contrary, the investigation seemed to point to foul play. Did her overbearing stepfather Michael Turney have something to do with Alissa&amp;rsquo;s sudden disappearance? As the last person to see Alissa that day, he holds more answers than he is willing to give. Almost two decades later, the case remains unsolved and Alissa has never been found.</description>

Bruce Jeffrey Pardon was a true piece of human garbage and when he found himself divorced and unemployed, he took it out on those closest to him, in the most horrific way imaginable.

Erika and Benjamin are not your average couple killers, if only for the fact that they didn&amp;rsquo;t have a motive for their crimes. Their only aim was the thrill of the kill. Cold-blooded doesn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to describe these two lizard people. Sources:

        <description>Podcast Description This case is one we planned to cover but has now become so time sensitive that we had to scrap our original Mini Morbid case for this week and do an emergency plea for everyone to check out the facts of this case and possibly take some action. Rodney Reed is accused of raping and murdering Stacey Stites in 1996, but the evidence definitely leads elsewhere. Now, Reed is set to be executed November 22nd for a crime he likely didn&amp;rsquo;t commit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s the dramatic conclusion to Lizzie Borden&amp;rsquo;s mysterious murder tale and we hope you brought your fans because, the vapors. Did Lizzie bump off her stepmother and father in cold blood after trying and failing to slowly poison them, or did someone else come in the house that day only while Lizzie was inside of it and kill them without anyone detecting? We certainly have our own thoughts about her acquittal, but take a listen for yourself and let us know what you think.</description>

On July 18, 1989 Robert Bardo stalked and eventually ended the life of a star that was truly on the rise. Although no one else is to blame for his decent into homicidal madness, his mental health and the lack of help he received for it seemed to play a big role in this horrific crime.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s a historical mini! This week&amp;rsquo;s tiny Morbid is a good old fashioned mystery/whodunit. After a long journey through the hellfire that was Dennis Rader, I think we can all use something lighter and possible politically charged murder is just the ticket. The Princes in the Tower takes us back to Tudor England when there was a real life game of thrones happening and sometimes things and often people got in the way of throne succession.</description>

When scant remains of the missing women were found some time later, along with cell phones that called for help several times and a camera with spooky photos, the case took a turn from confusing to scary.</description>

Or was she a powerful woman who was taken down by those around who for political and financial gain? The facts are more terrifying than the myths in this case, guys.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Alaina&amp;rsquo;s Mini Morbid takes a walk through the old Paris Morgue where dead bodies were put on display for the public to identify. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t always about the macabre task of identifying the recently deceased though. It became theater. It became a place to see and be seen. Dress in your finest duds and gander at some bloated corpses because this place was happening.

        <description>Podcast Description Rod Ferrell was a special kind of jerk. Convinced he was a 500 year old vampire named Vesago living in a 16 year old boy&amp;rsquo;s body, he took his otherworldly fantasies to the brink by carrying out two senseless, brutal murders. He didn&amp;rsquo;t just kill anyone, though. By his own admission, he murdered the parents of one of his cult followers for the rush of it. Does he care?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Gather &amp;lsquo;round you cats and chicks and moldy figs. We are about to take a trip in the way back machine to a time when New Orleans was more known for influenza than for beads. In 1918 (possibly 1911 but that&amp;rsquo;s debatable), a jazzy, caguely poetic monster was demanding New Orleaneans play his favorite jazz tunes or he would take his axe to their noggins. It was all very bizarre and that&amp;rsquo;s the way we like it.</description>

Stick around for Part 2 when dirty hippie livin&amp;rsquo; takes a dark turn into manipulation and brutal murder.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Oh, Edmund. This guy could have been something great if he had just ignored the part of his psyche that implored him to kill and dismember young women in order to have quality time with them.

Buckle up, Edmund is a real nasty character, but he will tell you that himself.</description>
