Instead, Farrant kicked off a moral panic over vampires, ghosts, and all manner of occult activities that featured prominently in the pages of British newspapers for years.&amp;nbsp;
Farrant’s letter received a few responses from others who claimed to have had their own supernatural experiences in Highgate Cemetery, but the story would likely have ended there had it not been for Sean Manchester.</description></item><item><title>Episode 501: The Stanfield Hall Murders | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360010/</guid><description>Podcast Description On November 28, 1848, Isaac Jermy and his son were shot and killed in their Wymondham estate, Stanfield Hall.

Are there more out there? Bell seemed to be at the wrong places at the wrong times about 98% of his miserable life if he isn&amp;rsquo;t the killer here, but Ash takes us further into his other known crimes and the last 5 murders that many attribute to his name.</description></item><item><title>Episode 154: The Galveston 11 Part 1 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360407/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 15:25:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360407/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the first installment of our series about The Texas Killing Fields, we focus on the 11 raped and murdered young girls referred to as the Galveston 11. In Part 1 of this case, Ash goes through Ed Bell&amp;rsquo;s tumultuous life, his confessions and the first murders.

On Thanksgiving Eve in 1928, John Blymire had reached the end of his rope. He was down on his luck for the past year and he was convinced someone had hexed him. After multiple visits to witches and healers, he was told his fears were valid and that his neighbor was the one responsible for his bad luck.</description></item><item><title>Episode 152: The Life and Mysterious Death of Marsha P.

Johnson was a pioneer for LGBTQ rights and a notable figure in the infamous Stonewall Uprising of 1969. She championed for transgender youth and gave back to her community throughout her short life. When she was found floating, dead in the Hudson River not long after the 1991 Pride parade. Her cause of death was noted as drowning but questions remain. How did she end up in the Hudson?</description></item><item><title>Episode 151: The Mysterious Death of Tamla Horsford | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360411/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 03:08:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360411/</guid><description>Podcast Description Well, we have another mishandled case for you weirdos. The 2018 death of Tamla Horsford is tragic but it is also wildly suspicious. This 40 year old, mother of 5 was found face down in a back yard after attending an adult sleepover. Her injuries were varied and seemingly unexplainable for a fall from a second floor balcony. What makes this worse is the fact that this took place in Forsyth County, Georgia, a place with a documented history of racial prejudice.</description></item><item><title>Episode 150: The Tragic Murder of Matthew Shepard Part 2 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360412/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 03:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360412/</guid><description>Podcast Description In our conclusion of this extremely difficult case, we discuss Matt&amp;rsquo;s last days and the aftermath of his passing. His legacy far outreached the crime that took his life. We discuss the absurdity of the &amp;ldquo;gay panic&amp;rdquo; defense and also explain the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

Matthew was lured from a bar in Laramie, Wyoming by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. Their intent was to pose as gay men and rob Matthew. What occurred was much more than robbery. They used a .357 magnum revolver to beat him to death, tying him to a buck fence and leaving him to die for 18 hours in the freezing Wyoming cold.</description></item><item><title>Listener Tales 14 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360414/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 02:43:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360414/</guid><description>Podcast Description Tonight it is a Listener Tales episode full to the brim with actual murderers, growling daymons, spooky ghost stories and a seriously clutch shaman.

There is a trail of strange Facebook Live videos and choppy surveillance film that provide more questions than answers. Is this a terrible and tragic accident or did something more sinister happen to Kenneka?</description></item><item><title>Episode 146: Mary King's Close/Nor Loch | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360417/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 01:23:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360417/</guid><description>Podcast Description So for today&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mini&amp;rdquo;, Alaina thought she was going to do Spooky Roads but then Scotland just went ahead and provided a whole-ass episode worth of spooky goodness that just had to be shared. Mary King&amp;rsquo;s Close is a fascinating, terrifying and bizarre piece of Scottish history and add in the supreme darkness of Nor Loch, where murders run rampant, executions were carried out and accused witches were dunked to their deaths and you have a seriously spooky Scottish episode that will kick off our new sporadic series, Scottish Shenanigans.</description></item><item><title>Episode 145: Lori Vallow Part 2 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360418/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360418/</guid><description>Podcast Description What a story this is, guys. Lori Vallow&amp;rsquo;s saga is still going on and we seem to be no closer to answers than where it all started. In Part 2 of this crazy tale, we meet her husband Chad, we hear about his shady past and we wonder where the hell her children Tylee and JJ could be. Why is it that people around this couple tend to die or disappear?</description></item><item><title>Episode 144: Zach Bowen And The Murder of Addie Hall Mega Mini Morbid | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360419/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 12:53:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360419/</guid><description>Podcast Description Well Alaina can&amp;rsquo;t do it. She can&amp;rsquo;t stay mini and she won&amp;rsquo;t! Honestly, this was supposed to be a real mini but then I found another source and things got wild. Thanks for appreciating my lack of brevity on the regular, weirdos. This case is WILD. Zach Bowen and Addie Hall were two 20-somethings experiencing a whirlwind romance in New Orleans in the early 00s. Both had a free spirit way about them, they loved fiercely and they seemed to carve out a niche as the king and queen of the French Quarter misfits.</description></item><item><title>Episode 143: Lori Vallow Part 1 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360420/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 02:23:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360420/</guid><description>Podcast Description This is a very recent and ongoing case that has baffled almost everyone who has heard of it. Lori Vallow made headlines in the end of 2019, when her two children, 17 year old Tylee and 8 year old JJ disappeared, seemingly into thin air. With reports circulating that she told witnesses stories like her children were long dead or staying with relatives who confirmed they were not, things look like they are going from bad to worse.</description></item><item><title>Episode 142: Maria Elena Milagro De Hoyos, The Unwilling Corpse Bride With Special Guest Rachel O'Brien | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360421/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 02:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360421/</guid><description>Podcast Description Maria Elena Milagro De Hoyos, known as Elena, walked into a Key West hospital suffering from a fatal infection of tuberculosis.

Initially, the case was quickly ruled a tragic, freak accident but after three autopsies, several false leads and a myriad of unanswered questions, Kendrick&amp;rsquo;s family is no closer to finding out the truth about what happened to their son on that winter day in Georgia.</description></item><item><title>Episode 140: Liquid Matthew, Maria Del Carmen and Dorothy Jane Scott With Special Guest Christine Schiefer! | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360424/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 19:20:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360424/</guid><description>Podcast Description That&amp;rsquo;s right!

Erika and Benjamin are not your average couple killers, if only for the fact that they didn&amp;rsquo;t have a motive for their crimes. Their only aim was the thrill of the kill. Cold-blooded doesn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to describe these two lizard people. Sources:

On July 18, 1989 Robert Bardo stalked and eventually ended the life of a star that was truly on the rise.

The Princes in the Tower takes us back to Tudor England when there was a real life game of thrones happening and sometimes things and often people got in the way of throne succession.</description></item><item><title>Episode 88: Dennis Rader "BTK" Part 3 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360494/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 03:58:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360494/</guid><description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s finally here!

It was all very bizarre and that&amp;rsquo;s the way we like it.</description></item><item><title>Episode 8: Charles Manson The “Love Bug Sent From Up Above” Part 2 | Morbid</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/6982360564/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 04:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/6982360564/</guid><description>Podcast Description In what seemed like an instant, Manson and his murderous, yet groovy family took the leap from a life built on peace and love to commiting some of the most violent and vicious murders in true crime history.
