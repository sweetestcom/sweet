They carried essential supplies across the treacherous Atlantic - and many paid with their lives. What's less well known is that many of those sailors were Chinese - volunteers who came to Britain to help the war effort and settled predominantly in the port city of Liverpool. But after the war, many of those Chinese sailors who returned home suddenly disappeared without a trace.</description></item><item><title>HMS Terror: Cursed Arctic Expedition | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060036/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:03:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060036/</guid><description>Podcast Description Was ever a ship more aptly named? In 1845, HMS Terror (and its forgettably named sister ship HMS Erebus) set off from Victorian Britain. Their quest was to discover the fabled Northwest passage through the Arctic ice.

The city and nearby countryside had been covered in ominous, mysterious webs, filled with untold numbers of caterpillars and their eggs. The city responded with panic, and rumours of plague and pestilence spread like wildfire.

Western culture is infused with the mythology of these pious warrior monks, who wielded magic and went on quests for legendary treasures.

For decades, generations of Germans have been grappling with the legacies of relatives who were part of the Third Reich.

Across the continent populations erupted in revolt, and the shockwaves of these revolutions rippled across the globe.

Almost as soon as he wrote his memoir, people doubted the wild stories of his travels across Europe and Asia.
His life and myth are unravelled on today's podcast with Laurence Bergreen, historian and author of 'Marco Polo: From Venice to Xanadu' who followed in the footsteps of Polo, travelling the old Silk Road all the way to China, to see for himself if the stories of the great Venetian merchant were true…</description></item><item><title>The Legacy of Rome | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060060/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 23:30:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060060/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rome has attracted aspiring conquerors and leaders for millennia, not just as a great metropolis, but as an idea. It has long been a symbol of military might and universal power, defined by political and religious authority as well as great feats of engineering that would leave indelible marks on the regions it conquered, and overshadow empire builders for centuries to come.

So what does the future of Afghanistan look like?</description></item><item><title>Scottish Clans | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060072/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 23:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060072/</guid><description>Podcast Description It is believed clans started to emerge in Scotland around 1100AD and were originally the descendants of kings – if not of demigods from Irish mythology. As well as kinship and a sense of identity and belonging, being part of a clan was an important part of survival throughout the centuries that would follow.
Scotland’s leading cultural historian, Professor Murray Pittock, joins Dan on the podcast to share the history of the clans from their Celtic origins through to the Clearances and the present day.</description></item><item><title>Archimedes and the Siege of Syracuse | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060073/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 23:30:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060073/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dan tells the story of Archimedes, the ancient Greek inventor whose weapons of war protected the town of Syracuse from a Roman army. The Romans laid siege to Syracuse between 213 and 212 BC, attacking by sea and land, but were repelled by the city's defences. The story goes that these included fantastical devices like the Claw of Archimedes, and a 'Death Ray' that would set ships ablaze. Eventually the stalemate broke and the Romans captured the city, but Archimedes' name would survive through the centuries.</description></item><item><title>Surviving Hitler and Stalin | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060074/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 23:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060074/</guid><description>Podcast Description Lord Daniel Finkelstein recounts stories from his parents' remarkable lives.

In the summer of 1963, a gang of masked robbers executed a daring plan to intercept a Royal Mail train carrying millions of pounds in cash. Operating in the quiet countryside of Buckinghamshire, England, the gang stopped the locomotive in its tracks, overpowering the train's crew and escaping with an astronomical haul. But the robbery itself was just the beginning - what came after - the most wanted men on the run, the jailbreak, the betrayals, fake identities, the surreptitious flights to Latin America and the manhunt across continents - the audacity of it all captured the public's imagination for decades.</description></item><item><title>Ragnar Lothbrok: Viking Legend | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060078/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 23:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060078/</guid><description>Podcast Description The ninth-century Danish king and warrior Ragnar Lothbrok became notorious again most recently through the TV series The Vikings.

In July and August of 1943, it was the last major attempt by the Nazis to turn the tide of the war in the East. Millions of soldiers and thousands of tanks would go head-to-head across the vast steppes around the Russian city of Kursk. The Soviets would emerge victorious from the bloody fighting and carry the momentum westwards, eventually reaching Berlin in 1945.

At 7:30 a.m. on July 1 1916, the British soldiers climbed out of their trenches and advanced towards the German lines.

Was it because of the significant challenge it posed to authorities and residents as they sought to bring it under control? Was it because of the extent of its devastation? Or was it because it occurred during an eventful couple of years when plague and war also threatened lives?
In this episode of Not Just the Tudors, Professor Suzannah Lipscomb talks to historian Rebecca Rideal, author of 1666: Plague, War and Hellfire, whose research has drawn on little-known sources to set the Great Fire of London in the broader context of the political, social and economic events of the time.</description></item><item><title>Wagner vs Putin: A History of Russian Coups | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060100/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 23:30:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060100/</guid><description>Podcast Description On the 24th of June, 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin and his paramilitary group Wagner carried out what appeared to be an attempted coup in Russia.

On the 10th of April, 1993, he was shot dead as he returned to his home in a quiet suburb of Johannesburg. Negotiations between Nelson Mandela's party and the ruling apartheid government had stalled, and the country was as close as it had ever been to civil war. The murder of Nelson Mandela's heir apparent forced the negotiators back to the table, where they would finally set a date for South Africa's first democratic election.</description></item><item><title>The Rise and Fall of Saddam Hussein | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060147/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 23:30:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060147/</guid><description>Podcast Description Perhaps one of the best-known modern dictators, Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq for nearly 30 years before eventually being overthrown in 2003 by the US Coalition. Known for his authoritarian rule, the use of chemical weapons against his own people, and multiple invasions of neighbouring countries - Saddam Hussein's legacy is a dark one.

In November 1781, a British slave ship carrying hundreds of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic began to run out of water. The ship was called the Zong, and her crew decided to save their own lives by throwing enslaved Africans overboard.

He'd just missed out to the Norwegians under explorer Roald Amundsen.

But did she fall? Was she pushed? Or did she throw herself down the stairs?&amp;nbsp;These questions exercised Tudor courtiers and foreign ambassadors at the time.

It was an age of royal madness, political intrigue, the birth of modern celebrity, the French revolution, American independence and the Napoleonic Wars so the satirists of Georgian Britain had plenty to work with.

Here, deep underground, the RAF built its Uxbridge headquarters where it commanded the defence of the country in the Battle of Britain. The pilots who fought in the skies are rightly hailed as heroes and affectionately known as 'the few', but they wouldn't have been able to do what they did without the many women behind them and under the ground gathering intelligence and commands, distributing them at lightening speed under the intense pressure of active battle.</description></item><item><title>Uniting Europe After WWII | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060168/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:30:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060168/</guid><description>Podcast Description Count Coudenhove-Kalergi was one of the most influential 20th Century European thinkers that you've never heard of. He was a pioneer of European integration, advocating for the free movement of people across European borders, a common currency and a single passport.

His tale is one of overthrowing fathers, eating babies and seducing women, both mortal and divine, by changing his own form. He's one of the most complex figures in history, and his story is one that's been retold throughout millennia. To try and make sense of it all, we're going back to the very beginning, to the origins of Zeus, starting with his grandfather and grandmother, Uranus and Gaia.</description></item><item><title>SAS Rogue Heroes: Paddy Mayne with Ben Macintyre | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060231/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060231/</guid><description>Podcast Description Lieutenant-Colonel 'Paddy' Mayne is a legendary figure in the history of the British Special Forces.

Autocracies and democracies alike have long relied on major sporting events to shore up their legitimacy and project their presence on the world stage. But why is sporting prowess so important for consolidating state power and prestige? Is it inevitable, and if not, how do we prevent it? Dan is joined by Jules Boykoff, Professor of Politics and Government at Pacific University, Oregon to talk about all these things, and more.</description></item><item><title>Life in Tudor England | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060234/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060234/</guid><description>Podcast Description What was life really like in Tudor England? This was a society where monarchy was under strain, the church was in crisis and contending with war, rebellion, plague and poverty was a fact of daily life. Yet it was also an age rich in ideas and ideals, where women asserted their agency and found a literary voice.&amp;nbsp;

The allure of this civilisation, rich in lost knowledge and culture, is obvious. But how do archaeologists separate fact from fiction? How can they be confident about the past, whilst remaining open to new ideas? Flint Dibble, an archaeologist at Cardiff University, joins Dan to talk about Atlantis and how experts should treat new discoveries and evidence.</description></item><item><title>Owain Glyndwr and The Welsh Revolt | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060237/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:30:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060237/</guid><description>Podcast Description England plays Wales in the World Cup today so it only makes sense that Dan looks back at what's often called Wales' last war of Independence against the English.

It has long been a symbol of military might and universal power, defined by political and religious authority as well as great feats of engineering that would leave indelible marks on the regions it conquered, and overshadow empire builders for centuries to come. Dan is joined by Simon Elliott, a historian, archaeologist and author of 'The Legacy of Rome', to discuss how the experience of being part of the Roman world is still felt in the modern day.</description></item><item><title>Plagues | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060239/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 00:30:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060239/</guid><description>Podcast Description From a plague in Athens during the Peloponnesian War in 430 BCE, to another in 540 that wiped out half the population of the Roman empire, down through the Black Death in the Middle Ages and on through the 1918 flu epidemic (which killed between 50 and 100 million people) and this century's deadly SARS outbreak, plagues have been a much more relentless fact of life than many realise.</description></item><item><title>A Short History of Scotland and England's Union | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060240/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 00:30:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060240/</guid><description>Podcast Description Yesterday the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Scottish government is not allowed to hold a second independence referendum without Westminster's agreement. It means, for now, Scotland will stay in the United Kingdom, though for how long is unclear.
The union between the nations of Great Britain goes back to 1707. On each side of the border, statesmen started to realise that a closer relationship offered solutions to problems both countries were facing: Scotland needed economic security and England needed political safeguards against French attacks.</description></item><item><title>Kings and Queens: Villains, Heroes and Rulers | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060241/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:30:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060241/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dan teams up with his parents and esteemed journalists Peter Snow and Ann MacMillan to explore the lives, loves, triumphs and disasters of a monarchy that is the envy of the world.

But, as Don hears from Leslie Alexander, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers University, underneath Central Park are the remains of Seneca - a village of African-American, Irish and German communities, whose inhabitants were forced from their homes to make way for the park’s construction in 1857.</description></item><item><title>Rogue Heroes: Veteran of the SAS | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060243/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:30:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060243/</guid><description>Podcast Description Mike Sadler is the last surviving original member of the SAS and is featured in the new television series SAS Rogue Heroes as a dashing young man and master of desert warfare.

It wouldn’t be until the turn of the following millennium that London regained its eminence under the Anglo-Saxons. Thanks to centuries of astonishing discoveries and decades of key archaeological research, we actually know quite a lot about Londinium; perhaps even why the Romans chose to found it there in what was previously a rural and peripheral landscape under the Celtic Britons.</description></item><item><title>ENDURANCE22: Dan's Diary #04 | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040060442/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040060442/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dan updates us from Antarctica about whether the SS Agulhas II has managed to break free from the ice that had surrounded it.

During two hundred years of colonial rule, Europeans exported their laws everywhere they could.

But how has this system - where political life was shaped by the births, marriages and deaths of the ruling family - maintained such a strong grip for so long?

As part of Hitler's inner social circle, he assisted the leader in virtually everything for the entire war years. His unconventional treatments were famed in Germany, and Hitler so trusted the 'miracle' prescriptions that trains were stopped to allow the doctor to deliver injections with a steady hand.

The untimely death of his warlike father, Henry V, placed the crown upon his head aged just 9 months. While England was in the ascendant in the Hundred Years' War in 1422, by the time he came of age his father's French conquests were disintegrating and the English nobility were locked in a dangerous struggle for power. In 1453, Henry suffered a complete mental collapse from which he never fully recovered, and then was used as a chess piece in the bloody Wars of the Roses which swept the country for the next 30 years.</description></item><item><title>Celebrity | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061054/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061054/</guid><description>Podcast Description Greg Jenner has given my children so many hours of happiness as the historical brains behind the Horrible History tv shows and movie, not to mention the Homeschool History podcast that it would have been grotesquely unfair not to have him on the show and talk about his new book on the history of celebrity.

But Rutger Bregman has made a convincing case that this simply isn't true.

With WW1 we seem to remember the enormous, tragic loss of life - captured so beautifully by the likes of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon.

It feels like we face a reckoning. What shall we do with it?
I talked to two authors of new books that wrestle with this. Christopher Joll is a former soldier who deals specifically with the spoils of war, while Alice Proctor thinks more generally about all objects and where they are best placed and how best to interpret them.</description></item><item><title>Death by Shakespeare | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061084/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 17:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061084/</guid><description>Podcast Description Poison, swordplay and bloodshed. Shakespeare’s characters met their ends in a plethora of gruesome ways. But how realistic were they? And did they even shock audiences who lived in a time of plague, pestilence and public executions, a time when seeing a dead or dying body on the way home from the theatre were high. I was joined by the wonderful Dr Kathryn Harkup, a chemist and author, on a tumultuous journey through the most dramatic and memorable parts of Shakespeare’s work.</description></item><item><title>The Battle of Okinawa | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061085/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061085/</guid><description>Podcast Description The last great battle of the Second World War was fought on the island of Okinawa. After 83 blood-soaked days, almost a quarter of a million people lost their lives. The death toll included thousands of civilians lost to mass suicide - convinced to do so by Japanese propaganda. I invited Saul David on the podcast to tell me about this shocking - often overlooked - chapter of the Second World War.</description></item><item><title>Origins of the Spanish Flu | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061086/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061086/</guid><description>Podcast Description This episode features military historian Douglas Gill who has extensively researched the origins of the Spanish Influenza as it emerged in 1915 and 1916 in northern France.

We talked about Viking women, old Norse-Icelandic sagas, mythology and poetry. Who were these Viking women who were champions on the battlefield, did they really exist, and is there much historic evidence? Jóhanna answered all these questions drawing upon the latest archaeological evidence. It seems the lives of Viking women were far more dynamic than we might imagine.</description></item><item><title>Battle of Britain 'What Ifs' | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061088/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 16:25:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061088/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dr. Jamie Wood and Professor Niall Mackay at the University of York are mathematicians who love history. Sensible dudes. They released a paper which sent the rest of the history world into a meltdown when they tried to use the statistics of airframe losses from the Battle of Britain to test just how close Germany might have come to victory in the battle.

Omid Djalili talked to me about one of his earliest stage creations, first performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1993. Over the next four years it was performed 109 times in 10 different countries. The backdrop of this epic storytelling piece was the tumultuous expectation for a Promised One in Persia in 1844. The claims made by a young merchant of Shiraz - who became known as the Bab - caused a revolution, and laid the foundations for the Baha'i Faith - which numbers some seven million followers around the world today.</description></item><item><title>How AI is Safeguarding Maritime Heritage | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061090/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061090/</guid><description>Podcast Description There are more historic artefacts on our ocean floor than there are in every museum in the world put together. Over thousands of years ships carrying every conceivable cargo have sunk in the rivers and oceans of the world. Protecting them is an enormous challenge.&amp;nbsp;

The man who rose to be the most powerful member of Henry VIII's court, his Lord Privy Seal, Principal Secretary and Chancellor. He was a driving force behind the English Reformation and constitutional changes that emphasised the centrality of Parliament, but his current mighty reputation depends on the fictional trilogy of the genius novelist Hilary Mantel. On this podcast I talk to another genius, Tracy Borman, historian and curator of Historic Royal Palaces, a biographer of Cromwell about the reality behind the literary legend.</description></item><item><title>Britain's Fightback | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061092/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061092/</guid><description>Podcast Description Daniel Todman is a Professor of Modern History at Queen Mary.

It opens with the fall fall of Singapore Feb 1942 and ends with Britain’s post war experiment in social democracy well underway.&amp;nbsp;

Back by popular demand, I was thrilled to be joined by bestselling author Lewis Dartnell.&amp;nbsp;
He explained how modern political and economic patterns correlate with events which happened not decades or centuries ago, but hundreds of millions of years before human civilisations existed. Pretty mind-blowing stuff.&amp;nbsp;
Perhaps more relevant than ever in these uncertain and weird times, it’s never been more compelling to understand Earth’s impact on the shape of human civilisations.</description></item><item><title>Mystery of the Alexander the Great Coin Hoard | Dan Snow's History Hit</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2040061094/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 20:23:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2040061094/</guid><description>Podcast Description Off the coast of the Gaza Strip fishermen have been discovering coins of extreme rarity and importance.
