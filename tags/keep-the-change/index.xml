People also say that if you follow your passion, the money will come. July is proof of that for me. BUT look at how long that has taken and how much effort.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Recently the Herald Business desk put together a list of the top 10 salaries of CEO’s in NZ. I hear and read things like:‘No job is worth more than $100,000’ ‘Tax the rich’. There are plenty of positive comments too, which is great to see. Instead of whining about how they are over paid because we don’t understand what they actually do and the responsibility they have, why don&amp;rsquo;t we try to learn about what they do and become a CEO ourselves?</description>

It’s great that it was less than economists predicted, but they are always wrong. Inflation has been outside the acceptable range for 2 whole years now - have you changed your ways or been sucked into doing nothing?

        <description>Podcast Description Turns out, working from home IS a thing and often employee&amp;rsquo;s pay costs associated with this. During the cerveza sickness, the IRD increased the tax free allowance when working from home (because so many people were). Basically, employees can receive a tax free allowance each week, to cover any additional costs associated with working away from the office. I.e. power, telephone, internet usage or printing. NOTE: this is paid by their employer IF THEY WANT TO, it is not an obligation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The number of people struggling financially is really starting to increase. Nearly 12% of Kiwis are currently behind on their debt repayments: personal loans, credit cards, BNPL etc. For some reason, it can be really hard for us Kiwis to ask for help. It seems to be something we’ve mastered - not asking for help. A lot of people will feel helpless or even embarrassed about their debt levels, so they will simply bury their heads in the sand.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This is where BNPL and credit cards are so dangerous as you ‘feel’ like you can get away with it. You don’t pay &amp;amp; nothing really happens. It’s in the credit providers&amp;rsquo; interest that you don’t pay so that the stinging interest &amp;amp; late payment penalties kick in. That’s where they make their money. This is why I suggest you remove the temptation and GET RID of BNPL, drop your credit card limit.</description>

Anyway, I didn’t want to just assume all ladies are risk-averse, as a lovely lady (my Mother) taught me that assumption is the Mother of all stuff ups.</description>

On the 31st of January I was brave enough to pull up my Financial Position. $37k of networth gone! Crypto, stocks, kiwisaver, sharesies, it had all sh!t the bed to put it politely. This is a time for logic, not emotion.

        <description>Podcast Description On the weekend, I was giving someone a hand with their finances and we noticed something pretty alarming. The cost of petrol and parking for them was over 10% of their total salary. We know from recent data that transport was the second biggest contributor to inflation for 2021. Statistics New Zealand said during last year the average price of 91 octane petrol increased 30%, from $1.87 per litre to $2.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you haven’t bumped into my passion project ‘Boys Get Paid’, you might find this subject line very confusing. Two Saturdays ago we hosted an event for 850 people. We also run a ‘punters club’ where we pool everyone&amp;rsquo;s money and bet it on behalf of everyone on the night. We had over 7,500 people deposit money from all over the country (and a few Aussies). This was the 5th year of doing this and we wanted to set a target for a pool of $500,000.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From time to time, I will go through the assets that I own and I will question myself about whether they are performing. Buy and hold is a great simplistic strategy, but sometimes, things can change and sometimes our tactics need to change as the world does. We discuss getting clear on thinking about the purpose for purchasing any type of asset.

        <description>Podcast Description Lately, we’ve been talking about prices going up and most people are probably just skimming past it thinking it doesn’t apply too much to them. I’ve put together a practical exercise you can do over the weekend. If you are brave enough, you need to look at EVERY cost in your life. This isn’t fun, but neither is not sleeping or worrying about money, so get this done.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Have you heard this saying before: ‘Your network is your net worth’? From what I have seen (as much as we might not like it), these sayings are very true and we will all see this playout throughout our lives and probably even use these sayings. Sometimes these things can work for us and other times against us. Ultimately, you need to build connections over time so that you can get these things working for you.</description>

We will need to educate people that this isn’t 30% tax on ALL of their income but only the income above $48,000 (see tax rates below).

        <description>Podcast Description The pay decrease - the increase in interest paid to the bank leading to less money left in the household for spending. Kiwis are obsessed with ‘locking in’ the best interest rate and playing the ‘will they go up or down’ game. In 2022 this means billions &amp;amp; billions (fair bit more than lotto) of dollars of debt will roll off their current locked in interest rates.

        <description>Podcast Description We&amp;rsquo;ve briefly spoke about how an interest-free student loan could be a good thing right now. Especially with inflation here. Many people with a student loan (or any form of interest-free debt) are sitting there thinking what is the point of paying this off in a hurry if it’s not really costing me anything in terms of interest? A good question, although there may be ways in which it will affect you financially down the track if you’re not careful.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today is exactly one year on since I made my first bitcoin purchase. The $3,300 is now worth $15,100. Pretty decent return, huh? An $11,800 unrealised gain. I haven’t sold it, so as you know, this is an ‘unrealised gain’. It would only become a realised gain if I were to sell &amp;amp; bank the profits (which I would pay tax on). It’s a great feeling. You probably think that it’s a great feeling due to the fact that I’ve made $11,800 on paper?</description>

Actually, come to terms with the debt that you have (this is why I suggest completing your financial position monthly). Rank your debt in order of importance. The most important may not be the largest. It is most probably the debt with the highest interest rate.
