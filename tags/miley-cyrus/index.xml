        <description>Music Lyrics She′s a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she&amp;rsquo;s broken
′Cause she&amp;rsquo;s always fine
She&amp;rsquo;s a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she′s hopeless
Only when she cries
When her favorite record′s on and she&amp;rsquo;s dancing in the dark
She can′t stop her eyes from welling up, up
She makes sure that no one&amp;rsquo;s ′round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics I′m on an island, dirty dancing in the sun
So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I′m still wishing for all the love that I don&amp;rsquo;t have
Mama told me, &amp;ldquo;Girl, smoke &amp;rsquo;em if you got ′em&amp;rdquo;
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I′m sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife
Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart
But don′t forget, baby, I&amp;rsquo;m a wildcard
I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
Don′t wait for me
&amp;lsquo;Cause forever may never come
I&amp;rsquo;m a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I′m a wildcard, oh-ooh</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics I don′t know
Who the hell you think you&amp;rsquo;re messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And I don′t know
Who the hell you think you&amp;rsquo;re messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And you smell like perfume that I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don′t wanna leave
And your phone is lost
But the car&amp;rsquo;s outside waitin out on the street
Tonight we′ll just be wrong
Ain&amp;rsquo;t done this in so long
We ain&amp;rsquo;t gotta talk baby
We′ll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don′t wanna leave
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop
Heart beats so loud that it′s drownin&amp;rsquo; me out
Livin′ in an April shower
You&amp;rsquo;re pourin&amp;rsquo; down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh, ooh)</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics We met each other on the neon dinghy
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beam down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback
On comets, coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend, Big Twitchy, rode the boat into the light
Surfed the NorthBreak
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy, ′cause that&amp;rsquo;s all we knew</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it′s with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it&amp;rsquo;s with you
I got some baggage, let′s do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics Amazing
I′m driving around town in a beat up old Mercedes
You think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy
You might be right
But when he smiles, I don′t care about the past
Just like that
I told myself I closed that door, but I&amp;rsquo;m right back here again
I know half of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying don′t make no sense,
So don′t ask me where I been
I&amp;rsquo;m not always right
But still I ain′t got time for what went wrong</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics Sunrise got us up early
So we put on our shade
Somehow the bedsheets are dirty
Like sticky sweet lemonade
Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, déjà vu
If I had control over you
We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin′ stupid like we&amp;rsquo;re kids
Wearin′ rose colored lenses, let&amp;rsquo;s just play pretend
Wearin&amp;rsquo; rose colored lenses, pretend we′ll never end</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics I don′t wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to think it over
We′re much older and the bone&amp;rsquo;s too big to bury
Oh, isn&amp;rsquo;t it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to hell, but we never came back
I′m sorry that you′re jaded</description>

        <description>Music Lyrics We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can′t be sold
We were right &amp;rsquo;til we weren′t
Built a home and watched it burn
Mmm, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna leave you, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered, I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don′t understand
I can take myself dancing</description>
