        <description>Podcast Description We’re surprised and delighted this fine Monday… by Mr. J.J. Abrams. This wildly creative filmmaker and musician gives us an hour inside his brain. We’re humbled by his request to audition for SmartLess advertising reads, we’re warned not to go down the rabbit-hole of modular synthesis, and we learn the genesis of the term “blockbuster.” All of this while Sean wears his Tatooine hat to impress J.J. (who doesn’t even notice).</description>
