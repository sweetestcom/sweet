In 2023 there seemed to be no end to turmoil and conflict around the world. Wars, coups and disasters – natural or otherwise sprang up seemly without a break. On The Front Page we’ve done our best to make sense of what’s been happening around the globe, and our place in all this turmoil. Today we revisit some of the interviews that have helped expand our understanding of a planet that sometimes seemingly defied explanation - including the Gaza conflict, the Wagner Coup attempt in Russia, Africa's coup belt, Morocco's earthquake, and the disputed territory Artsakh / Nagorno Karabakh.</description></item><item><title>Royals revisited: How 'Spare' and the coronation shaped the monarchy this year | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750631/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750631/</guid><description>Podcast Description The early weeks of 2023 were dominated by an ugly family feud on a global scale. Prince Harry’s memoir, Spare, gave an unprecedented glimpse at the inner-workings of the Royal Family and laid bare the tensions between Harry and Meghan and the rest of the family. This set the tone for a year that was meant to be a celebration that King Charles had waited his whole life to enjoy.</description></item><item><title>2023 in review: A year of cyclones, elections, AI - and political comebacks | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750001/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750001/</guid><description>Podcast Description Where to begin with 2023? The year started in a big way, with the resignation of Jacinda Ardern and two once-in-a-century weather events in a row. And it didn’t slow down from there. Ministerial car crashes. An exploding submarine. World Cup highs and lows. The threat of AI. An active shooter at rush hour. A radio station that got effed live on air. Crime, the economy, trans rights, global conflict.</description></item><item><title>Weather, traffic and live events - What summer has in store for NZ | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750002/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750002/</guid><description>Podcast Description 2023 has been quite a year, and many of us are ready and waiting for our summer break to begin. With music festivals and other entertainment on offer, a lot of us need a break. But after a year of violent weather, what state are our key roads and highways in before the busy traffic period? And are we going to get the summer weather we missed out on last year, or could we be in for more of the same?</description></item><item><title>Trans-Tasman migration: What's drawing Kiwis to Australia? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750003/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750003/</guid><description>Podcast Description One of the biggest talking points of 2023 has been migration – not just who is coming to New Zealand, but how many of us are leaving the country. This year has seen record numbers of New Zealanders flock across the ditch and set up shop in Australia. There’s nothing new about a move across the Tasman, but the sheer volume of Kiwis leaving has sparked concerns over a potential brain drain.</description></item><item><title>How the future of the Gaza, Ukraine conflicts could be decided by US politicians | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750004/</guid><description>Podcast Description For the last two months, the world has been watching as the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip continues with no end in sight. Over 18,000 Palestinians have died as Israel continues their bombing campaign, and global efforts for a ceasefire are going ignored, even failing at the highest echelons of international politics. Yet while this conflict may be dominating headlines, war continues to rage in Ukraine, and the future of the country’s fight against Russia seems up in the air as US politicians battle over how much aid to supply the country.</description></item><item><title>Is the National-led Government ready for three years of Māori-led protests? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750005/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750005/</guid><description>Podcast Description The new Government is only a week in but there have already been some fiery exchanges. National’s Christopher Luxon and Labour’s Chris Hipkins crossed swords in parliament and we’ve already seen Kiwis take to the streets in protest. Te Pati Māori, holding its largest-ever caucus, has promised that this only the start and that there will be further protests to come. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has made a number of controversial comments that have left the Luxon red-faced.</description></item><item><title>What are the foreign policy issues facing Winston Peters as Minister? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750006/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750006/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealand has a new Government – and this means a new Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Winston Peters will take over from Nanaia Mahuta in a role that’s getting more complicated with every passing day. Trade wars, environmental devastation, and open military conflicts have returned to the globe on a level not seen in decades, to name just a few of the diplomatic tightropes that Peters will have to walk as he navigates this role.</description></item><item><title>Could unlimited leave be the way of the future? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750007/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750007/</guid><description>Podcast Description The thought of a job with unlimited leave might seem splendid.
You could ostensibly take weeks off whenever you feel like it and have a work-life balance that most could only dream of.
But this isn’t always how these things work out.
Jarrod Haar, Associate Dean at Massey Business School, has looked into the details of how having holidays when you want actually works in practice and found that there can be some worrying unintended consequences.</description></item><item><title>Royal racism row: Will latest allegations further damage the monarchy? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750008/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750008/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the two years since Harry and Meghan sat down with Oprah, one question has hung over the Royal Family. Just who in the family raised concerns about the colour of Prince Archie’s skin before his birth? Now, the two senior royals have been named in a since-pulled Dutch translation of a new book about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their royal battles. It has sparked yet another scandal that has involved all the key players and themes of modern Royal life, from press scrutiny of the family to the ongoing tensions between Princes William, Harry and their wives.</description></item><item><title>Heart health: Why are cardiac patients struggling to get the right treatment? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750009/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750009/</guid><description>Podcast Description Many of us have had the unfortunate experience of witnessing the delays in New Zealand’s health system first hand. For some, that may simply mean the delay in seeing your GP or hours spent in the emergency room. But for others, the waiting game can have long-term implications for their health. NZ Herald investigate journalist Nicholas Jones for several months has been looking into cardiac patients and how they are being treated, and has heard some shocking stories about lengthy waiting times for surgery, and how some Kiwis are getting better care overseas.</description></item><item><title>Do Tory Whanau's problems warrant a resignation - or a wider debate? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750010/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750010/</guid><description>Podcast Description Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has admitted to having a drinking problem. This comes after two incidents in which she has been seen visibly intoxicated in public spaces. Some councillors are now also calling Whanau’s resignation, with some questioning whether she can do the big job required of her. It also comes in the broader context of former Labour politician Kiri Allan, who blew over the legal limit after being involved in a car crash.</description></item><item><title>Will the new Government's policies help or hurt the economy? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750011/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750011/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Reserve Bank has kept the Official Cash Rate at 5.5 per cent – and has stressed that our fight against inflation is not yet done.

Evidence showed decades of decline in the quality of the education system, with literacy and numeracy rates falling steadily. Add the dual problems of absenteeism and overworked teachers and you have a system in dire need of repair. So what is the new Government proposing? And will the plans put forward actually make the difference needed? Today on The Front Page, Newstalk ZB journalist Shannon Johnstone joins us to discuss whether Kiwi kids are alright.</description></item><item><title>The new Government has been sworn in - what are their top priorities? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750014/</guid><description>Podcast Description It has been over six weeks since Election Day, but finally, Christopher Luxon has been sworn in as Prime Minister.
Weeks of negotiations have delivered the first-ever three-party coalition government in the MMP era, with National joined by both Act and NZ First ministers at the Cabinet table. But now that the negotiations and swearing-in ceremonies are done, these three parties need to get on with governing. What will their priorities be as a government, and how will those detailed coalition agreements reshape Aotearoa?</description></item><item><title>Four World Cups, no wins - did NZ sport lose its edge in 2023? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750015/</guid><description>Podcast Description A massive year of four world cups has left Aotearoa empty-handed.
Kiwi teams fell short in rugby, cricket, football and netball, leaving some question marks about whether we’d lost our competitive edge.
But our teams also exceeded expectations. No one expected the White Ferns to beat Norway. The All Blacks were given no chance of making it to the final. And the Black Caps also rose above the naysayers to land a spot in the semi-finals.</description></item><item><title>On the Campaign: Inside the National-Act-NZ First deal, the new Cabinet and policy priorities | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750016/</guid><description>Podcast Description After 40 days, New Zealand has a new government.

With the gutting of the magazine industry now well-bedded in, many of the specialised titles that once relished in telling tales of bands on the road have disappeared. Most of the coverage of music and arts in wider mainstream media has also vanished. So now how do Kiwi acts get their voices heard?

But when you’re Christmas shopping this year, some deals might seem too good to be true.
But that’s because they’re coming with a hidden cost.
A new report from World Vision claims that a staggering $8 billion of imports to Aotearoa every year are linked to modern slavery.
Everything from shoes and clothing to furniture and electronics could be made by people working in dire conditions and paid next to nothing.</description></item><item><title>Will Wayne's Brown's congestion charges save your commute or break Auckland? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750020/</guid><description>Podcast Description Anyone who has faced a morning commute on our largest city’s roads knows that Auckland has a truly painful traffic problem.
Mayor Wayne Brown has ostensibly had enough and has announced a plan for congestion charging to be introduced.
Councillors are supporting the move and pushing ahead with the plan, but there are also serious concerns about the impact this will have on low-income earners.
So how will the plan work in practice?</description></item><item><title>AI revolution: Is a universal basic income the answer to job losses? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750021/</guid><description>Podcast Description Artificial intelligence is the buzzphrase of 2023. The building blocks for this technology have long been in the works, but we have now reached the point the power of generative AI can actually be put into practice. The promise here is that it will speed up everything we do, removing the mundane and giving us more time to focus on creative challenges. But what are the unintended consequences that could emerge from this?</description></item><item><title>Will the ever-rising cost of rents push Kiwis overseas? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750022/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rental prices in have skyrocketed over the last year.
These high rental prices are giving young Kiwis yet another incentive to take their skills elsewhere, sparking concerns that some might exhibit their discontent by dusting off their passports.
So how concerning are these rent rises? And how much worse could they become with the balance of power swinging further in favour of landlords under the new Government? On The Front Page today, Brad Olsen, the chief executive and principal economist at Infometrics, joins us to discuss why it’s no fun being a renter in New Zealand.</description></item><item><title>Anarchy in the UK: How David Cameron's surprise comeback shocked the world | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750023/</guid><description>Podcast Description Westminster is echoing with accusations of betrayal. The source of this indignation is former UK home secretary Suella Braverman. Braverman has been sacked by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after making a series of incendiary comments about the homeless, asylum seekers, and the Israel-Hamas war.
After Braverman’s ousting, Sunak announced a cabinet reshuffle. The big surprise? Former PM David Cameron has returned to political office as foreign secretary.</description></item><item><title>Did the actors' strike stop bots from becoming Hollywood stars? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750024/</guid><description>Podcast Description Hollywood is moving again.
When the writers' strike ended after 148 days there was a hope that the actors’ union and studio representatives would be able to reach a quick resolution. Instead, the strike was only called off on day 118.

But two things are clear at this stage. We will have an impressive spread of 32 Māori MPs across the political parties.

The return of travel and tourism has not gone as smoothly as we might have hoped. But amid all these problems, there are signs that the turbulence will reduce in the coming years.
A recent tourism summit saw industry leaders, share stories of how AI, luggage-sorting robots, passport-free airports, and supersonic flight could all play a role in the future of air travel.</description></item><item><title>Is video refereeing improving calls or killing the fun in sport? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750028/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750028/</guid><description>Podcast Description Match officials are battling to stay out of the headlines these days.
Whether it’s rugby or football, most games are followed by furious debate – not on the merits of the players, but rather on whether the right referring calls were made, and if they were made fast enough. Since the highly controversial Rugby World Cup final, which was dominated by TMO decisions, we’ve also seen VAR’s use in the Premier League take a walloping from pundits.</description></item><item><title>Why Siouxsie Wiles' legal case against Auckland Uni could make history | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750029/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750029/</guid><description>Podcast Description One of the country’s most recognisable scientists has taken her employer to court.

Of those, 29% of bosses claim they have suffered a financial loss due to these problems.
What’s most striking is that over a quarter of businesses have been forced to cut their cybersecurity budgets amid the current economic strain. They simply can’t afford to invest more in protecting their businesses.
There are, however, hackers fighting on the good side to ensure that firms aren’t compromised even if they’re having to cut budgets.</description></item><item><title>Are we nearing a media meltdown? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750031/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750031/</guid><description>Podcast Description The media sector has been rocked by some tough news this year.
We’ve seen the closure of Today FM, the canning of The Project, restructuring at major news providers and a staggering report that MediaWorks faces an uncertain future. There are now even concerns that the cracks are starting to show in radio listenership.

The disputed territory, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, was once home to around 120,000 ethnic Armenians.
Artsakh is officially viewed by much of the world as part of Azerbaijan. In September, Azerbaijani forces enacted a large-scale military offensive against the breakaway state.
The residents fled, and soon a decree was signed that would officially dissolve all of Nagorno-Karabakh’s institutions.
Despite the ongoing refugee crisis, this extraordinary story has faded from public attention.</description></item><item><title>The struggles facing the KiwiSaver market as it approaches $100 billion | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750034/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750034/</guid><description>Podcast Description In 16 years, the value of KiwiSaver has hit a staggering $96.2 billion dollars. While that sizeable nest egg is good news for savers longer term, recent KiwiSaver balances have made for some tough viewing. In the last three months, the total value of KiwiSaver has slipped by $1.3 billion as many funds booked negative returns. Global instability, a tough equity market and volatility in international stock prices have all placed downward pressure on fund balances.</description></item><item><title>What does Winston Peters want and will Christopher Luxon give in to him? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750035/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750035/</guid><description>Podcast Description After a three-year absence from the halls of power, NZ First leader Winston Peters is set to make a grand return.
As the country awaits the final vote tally, it is widely expected the traditionally left-leaning special votes will see National and Act require the support of Peters to form a majority government.
So what motivates Peters? How does he want from the negotiations? And how far will Luxon bend to his will?</description></item><item><title>What threat do cyclones and strong winds pose over the coming months? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750036/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750036/</guid><description>Podcast Description Tropical cyclone. Hurricane. Typhoon. They go by many names, but these storms can have a devastating impact when they hit. Instead of enjoying sunny spring weather this week, the north of the country faced remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Lola which was initially set for a head-on collision with Vanuatu, before the storm was downgraded to an ex-tropical cyclone.
With the rapid warming of the atmosphere due to climate change, there are growing risks that these storms will only become stronger.</description></item><item><title>What does the future hold for the All Blacks after the Rugby World Cup? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750037/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750037/</guid><description>Podcast Description The All Blacks’ comeback story has reached its end. The team have missed out on their chance to make history at the Rugby World Cup, falling short by just one point against the Springboks.
This marks the record fourth time the Springboks have won the trophy as well as the end of coach Ian Foster’s tenure in charge of the All Blacks.

Thousands have already lost their lives, and there are now risks that bloodshed could stretch across borders and involve other countries. The war has also created a diplomatic minefield, with politicians picking their words very carefully when commenting on the violence.

We’ve seen major craft brewers and wine companies battle to make ends meet. Brothers Beer, Villa Maria and Sacred Hill are just some of the biggest names to have fallen victim to these struggles.

This comes after several years of increased illegal activity, driven by the arrival of Australian gangs in Aotearoa. Communities have expressed deep concerns, saying they feel intimidated, unsafe and concerned about being caught in the crossfire between opposing gangs. So what are National, Act and NZ First proposing?

Well, having won the election, they now have to deliver on that pledge. They have inherited an economy that is in rough shape but slowly on the mend, so how big of a task lies ahead for them? And what does this crisis actually mean for those worst affected by it? Later, we’ll be joined by the New Zealand Food Network CEO Gavin Findlay to discuss how much families are struggling.</description></item><item><title>On The Campaign: How important are the special votes? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750045/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750045/</guid><description>Podcast Description October 18th: In this final episode of On the Campaign for the moment, we hear from NZ Herald head of data Chris Knox about why the special votes are so important in determining the shape and makeup of the next government.

Only three years after Jacinda Ardern led her party to a historic landslide, Chris Hipkins has had the dubious honour of guiding his party to the biggest electoral defeat for a governing party yet.
The question now is what the future holds for Labour. The last three National governments each lasted three terms, and after losing half its caucus, Labour has a long way to go to prevent that from happening a fourth time.</description></item><item><title>What will a National - Act - NZ First coalition look like? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750047/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750047/</guid><description>Podcast Description While special votes are still to be counted, and a by-election needs to be held, it looks like National and Act are set to form the next government. With Christopher Luxon as Prime Minister, he now has to build a Cabinet and start implementing his policies. But without a full majority, Luxon needs to negotiate with Act and its leader David Seymour to decide what policies to adopt and how many of Act’s MPs will sit around the Cabinet table.</description></item><item><title>On The Campaign: The campaign is over - but when will the new government be sworn in? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750048/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 04:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750048/</guid><description>Podcast Description October 16th: The campaign is over and the coalition negotiations have begun.

Cancer being missed. Medicine given to patients who are allergic to it. Surgical equipment left inside patients.
We trust our lives to medical professionals to find out what’s wrong with us and help us get better, but sometimes the mistakes of medical staff can lead to dire consequences.
Thankfully, processes are in place to hold doctors, nurses and other staff accountable when things go wrong, and hopefully prevent mistakes from happening again.</description></item><item><title>Election 2023 results: Inside National's blue wave and Labour's wipeout | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750050/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 23:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750050/</guid><description>Podcast Description In a special crossover episode, the hosts of On The Campaign and The Front Page discuss the results of Election 2023.
As the polls predicted poll night was a bloodbath for Labour. Their caucus has nearly halved, several key MPs are out and while Chris Hipkins has not resigned yet, it seems like the inevitable outcome. But for National and Act, it was a case of celebrations. Christopher Luxon is set to be our next Prime Minister, National swung a number of seats their way, and so did Act.</description></item><item><title>On The Campaign: Which party, politician and policy has performed the best? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750051/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750051/</guid><description>Podcast Description October 13: With only a day of voting left, and hours left of the actual campaign, for this last episode before Election Day, Hamish talks to NZ Herald editor at large Shayne Currie and Markets with Madison host Madison Reidy, who will be fronting the Herald's election coverage tomorrow night.

So where has it been this election cycle?
After floods and storms claimed homes and lives earlier this year, it seemed like all our political leaders were on the same page.

That changed this weekend after Palestinian militants attacked settlements in southern Israel, killing hundreds, taking hostages, and sparking harsh retaliation from Israel. As our politicians exchanged back and forths about the crisis, questions were asked about Aotearoa’s stance on a two-state solution, and what role this country can play in foreign affairs.</description></item><item><title>On The Campaign: Could there really be a second election? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750059/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 04:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750059/</guid><description>Podcast Description October 9: We are just five sleeps away from Election Day, but some parties are already discussing a second election.

Under the current Labour Government, we’ve seen a number of strong protections come in to give renters more certainty. But now, both National and Act are promising to reverse some of those restrictions and in doing so return more power to the landlords.

Both Auckland and Wellington need to save money and raise more funds to pay for everything.

At the same time, several wide-reaching existing policies to offset the cost of living ended, leading to yet another financial shock.
With three months to go until the election, the focus for many is now turning to what the parties vying for our votes have to offer – and if there’ll be any financial relief before we cast our ballots.</description></item><item><title>Teaching Council responds after high profile teacher controversies | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750147/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750147/</guid><description>Podcast Description Several headlines recently have sparked concerns about the state of our teaching pool. Most notably, a man legally known as Taurapa has become the latest teacher found to have had a sexually inappropriate relationship with a student.

The latest data shows that Kiwis are indeed worse off overall than they were before the pandemic ripped through the economy. Dropping house prices and the rising cost of living mean that we own less and we’re spending more on the necessities to get by. And yet, many of us are still splashing out on luxuries and not changing our behaviour.</description></item><item><title>Musk vs Zuckerberg: Will Threads change the social media game? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750149/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750149/</guid><description>Podcast Description Meta, the owner of Facebook, is shaking up social media with an app some are calling the 'Twitter killer'. Threads will offer a very similar service, but it will be powered by the massive machine Mark Zuckerberg has built since starting FaceMash, as Facebook was first known, in his university dorm room. In the battle between the tech titans Twitter owner Elon Musk has been making a few moves of his own – but none of these have been well-received.</description></item><item><title>The latest controversy over a millionaire's boatshed plans | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750150/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750150/</guid><description>Podcast Description A house, once owned by the Sultan of Brunei, in the affluent Auckland suburb of Herne Bay has become the centre of a dispute with community residents divided over whether the new owners should be allowed to build a boatshed.
Some wealthy backers have come out in support of the plan, while others reckon it would be an eyesore.

This comes after a proposal to cut more than 200 jobs at Victoria University of Wellington, which would have seen entire courses removed from the syllabus and others folded into neighbouring departments - just one of many universities that have had to take this measure amid growing budget holes. While the Government has responded to the furious calls from staff to plug the funding gap, serious questions persist about whether these steps go far enough.</description></item><item><title>Is failed Wagner Group coup the beginning of the end for Putin? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750157/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750157/</guid><description>Podcast Description Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took a stunning turn over the weekend, when the leader of the Wagner mercenary force threatened a coup against President Vladmir Putin.
Yevgeny Prigozhin’s long-brewing pushback against Russia’s military establishment was short-lived. Within 24 hours, Belarus had negotiated a deal that saw the man once dubbed Putin’s chef allowed to leave the country without any blood being shed.
The saga has baffled international onlookers, with many believing that even though this coup failed to topple the Russian leader, it may mark the beginning of the end of Putin’s long reign.</description></item><item><title>How healthy homes could save lives - and $1 billion a year | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750158/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750158/</guid><description>Podcast Description Winter is well and truly upon us now, and with it has come a steady stream of news articles offering advice on how to keep your house warm during the cold months while saving on energy bills. Cost cutting is an extra priority this year with the inflation crunch.

Supporters have, however, pointed out that ethnicity is just one of a number of factors being considered alongside clinical priority, time spent on the waitlist, geographic location and deprivation level.</description></item><item><title>Is Kāinga Ora too slow in managing troubled tenants? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750163/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750163/</guid><description>Podcast Description Kāinga Ora is getting bad press once again, following the publication of the harrowing story of a Hamilton woman who for years lived next door to disruptive and disrespectful tenants.

Businesspeople want its ownership structure to change, the mayor wants it to move and citygoers complain that it’s an eyesore.
To make matters worse, the workers have faced years of safety issues and even deaths onsite. This has led to often tense relations between the union and management.

But in doing so, they’re leaving an opportunity for the minor parties to pick up voters on the fringes. The thing is that as society becomes more polarised, those fringes are becoming larger and larger.

Ram raids, street violence and burglaries have grabbed headlines time again, creating a sense that New Zealand is no longer a safe place to live – and a narrative that crime has got worse under the Labour government.

Many high-profile criminals in recent years have received name suppression for months or years on end – with the five year suppression for the Mama Hooch rapists being one of the recent examples of how long suppression can last. That can cause tension with the general public, as it often seems as though it's only high profile offenders who get to keep their identities hidden.</description></item><item><title>Did Labour's party congress triumph over National's housing u-turn? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750178/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750178/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Labour Party's key focuses for Chris Hipkins' first party congress as leader were keeping the age of superannuation static and continuing an apprenticeship scheme.

So why are two agencies, both accountable to the Government, becoming so competitive?</description></item><item><title>Auckland's City Rail Link - When will it finally open? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750182/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750182/</guid><description>Podcast Description It has just been confirmed that Auckland’s City Rail Link opening has been delayed yet again, pushing out the opening date out to 2026.
This comes off the back of numerous earlier delays and cost blow-outs and will only exacerbate the level of frustration in the city. The initial idea for the plan goes back to the 1920s, and delays have spread to the actual project.
So how much longer will Auckland’s inner city remain a construction site?</description></item><item><title>How prepared is New Zealand for a tsunami? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750183/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750183/</guid><description>Podcast Description After an earthquake near the Loyalty Islands last Friday, a tsunami warning sparked sleepless nights in coastal areas around Aotearoa as residents waited for the potential waves. While the damage was limited, one Ahipara resident told the NZ Herald the resulting swells were “much, much worse” than those that came in after Cyclone Gabrielle earlier this year. It again raises the question about how prepared our coastal country is for a potential tsunami.</description></item><item><title>Christopher Luxon on what he'd have done differently for Budget 2023 | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750184/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750184/</guid><description>Podcast Description The annual Government Budget announcement is always a major PR opportunity for the Government, to lay out its vision for the country. Labour has now presented that vision – and unsurprisingly, Opposition parties aren’t onboard with what they see. National leader Christopher Luxon said that it showed the Government had run out of ideas – and warned that a Capital Gains Tax is on Labour’s agenda for the election.</description></item><item><title>Is Budget 2023 what the economy needed? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750185/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750185/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, the Labour Government delivered its sixth Budget. It's their last before October’s election, with key figures in the worlds of childcare, public transport, and public housing. This Budget arrives at a time when the economy faces a cost-of-living crisis and pressures stemming from the destruction caused by Cyclone Gabrielle.

Under-resourcing, long work hours and poor pay have culminated in teachers and nurses walking off the job to protest these working conditions. The 2023 Budget offers an opportunity for the Government to address these concerns, but economic pressure on the country right now means that any steps taken likely won’t go as far as many hope.</description></item><item><title>Wellington hostel fire: What we know so far | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750189/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 00:23:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750189/</guid><description>Podcast Description The nation woke up to harrowing news this morning as a blaze in Wellington ripped through a hostel. Fire crews worked through the night to save as many lives as they could, but the full extent of lives and livelihoods lost so far remains unclear.

Depending on who you ask, the Artificial Intelligence interface is either set to take over humanity or it’s little more than a quirky digital toy. As is often the case with these things, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
So what is the potential of AI technology? Are technology companies taking risks by moving too fast?

This continues a long trend of politicians keeping our debt levels low rather than investing heavily in infrastructure needed for the future. So is this the best approach given the myriad challenges the country faces? And as a society do we need to become more willing to take on debt to make sure our cities are fit for the future?</description></item><item><title>Travel is booming, but can Kiwis afford to take flight? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750192/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750192/</guid><description>Podcast Description After the era of lockdowns, the travel sector is hitting another speed bump. The Minister for Tourism has publicly criticised the high cost of some tourism operators, leading to questions about whether Aotearoa's tourists are being taken for a ride.
Not to be deterred, international airlines are trying to lure us back to the skies with more direct routes and new innovations to improve the travel experience. But with economic concerns looming, can the average Kiwi still afford the luxury of domestic travel, let alone international?</description></item><item><title>What is the psychological toll of extreme weather emergencies? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750193/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750193/</guid><description>Podcast Description Auckland was hit by torrential rain once again this week, stirring up memories of the record-breaking flooding seen in January. Those memories seemed to spark a fight or flight response in Auckland, with the entire city fleeing home at the same time, causing gridlocked traffic for hours across the city. Given that scientists are warning these weather events are fast becoming the norm, how can we learn to better cope with weather panic?</description></item><item><title>What is the state of New Zealand's up and down economy? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750194/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750194/</guid><description>Podcast Description Two major financial reports have given a glimpse at the state of Aotearoa's economy.
The financial stability report and unemployment figures gave us a sense that the economy is still holding up well, but that could change soon.
All forecasts point to things becoming a whole lot tougher as the pressure mounts.
So how much worse will the situation become? Will the Government step in to help?

Schools have been evacuated across Auckland and Northland, and emergency services have again been on high alert.
This opens fresh wounds for a region that was only recently in the firing line of severe flooding and cyclone Gabrielle.
So why has this been happening so much in the same region?

Yet days after Meka Whaitiri quit the Labour Party, her two-time Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate rival Elizabeth Kerekere has quit the Green Party.
What was behind Kerekere’s decision to leave, and what does this shake-up between Labour, the Greens and Te Pāti Māori mean for a potential coalition after the election?</description></item><item><title>After the Coronation - what's next for Charles III's reign? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750197/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750197/</guid><description>Podcast Description King Charles the Third has officially been coronated, in an extravagant state affair that has not been seen in the Commonwealth for 70 years.
And the King has been waiting just as long to fulfill his destiny as sovereign.

So what motivated Whaitiri to make the move?

This would include improving the stands and building a retractable roof to allow for all-weather play.
However, their plans for an upgrade façade come as a consortium looking to build a national stadium on Auckland’s waterfront prepare to introduce a new, cheaper plan. So who has the better proposal, and can we afford either of them?</description></item><item><title>Why do Governments spend so much on consultants? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750201/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750201/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Government has spent millions upon millions of dollars on outside consultants pursuing major policy ideas.
This is despite Prime Minister Chris Hipkins saying there’s a need to lessen the Government’s reliance on the private sector to get things done.
In fact, this is one of the few areas where we’ve seen bipartisan consensus, with National Party leader Christopher Luxon also critical of the level of consultant spending.</description></item><item><title>What to expect from King Charles' Coronation | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750202/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750202/</guid><description>Podcast Description The countdown to the Coronation is on.
Eight months after the death of his mother, Charles the Third will go through his formal investiture as King, in a ceremony he’s been waiting for his whole life.

The chance to have your say is a mere six months away, and the good and the great are already competing for a ballot box tick by their name. So, who has the funds to run a massive campaign?

Aussie Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made it easier for New Zealanders to get citizenship across the ditch, allowing over 400,000 Kiwis currently living there to vote and access basic support.

The figure came in well below expectations, suggesting that the rising cost of living had peaked.
This comes amid continued rates rises from the Reserve Bank, which has been among the most aggressive in the world.
So have rates rises gone too far? Are we unnecessarily engineering a deep recession?

He isn’t alone in making these complaints, with many other construction insiders also expressing the view that regulation has made building projects move at a glacial pace. So are they right?

But that’s not such a sure bet these days. Despite years of acknowledging the housing situation as a crisis, it seems like this country is always in an uphill struggle against under-supply and over-pricing. Add to this the expensive materials, backlogged supply chains and growing concerns over climate change – and you have a complex issue to which there are no easy answers.</description></item><item><title>Will we do anything about the looming superannuation crisis? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750260/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750260/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealanders have been able to rely on the security of a state pension for decades.
In the 1970s, this scheme kicked in from the age of 60 before steadily rising to 65 in the decades that followed.
But since 2001, the age of eligibility hasn’t moved at all – despite the fact that New Zealanders are living longer and having fewer children.
Is it time to adjust our superannuation age or perhaps change the system to one that takes account of the personal circumstances of the population?</description></item><item><title>The business of health - are we getting value for money? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750261/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750261/</guid><description>Podcast Description Healthcare has always been one of the battleground issues in New Zealand politics.
MPs love to sling mud over what the other party has or hasn’t done in terms of building hospitals or paying nurses properly. The current Government has made a big deal out of funding our healthcare further, with $30 billion assigned in last year’s budget. But given how much attention is paid to healthcare, why does it always seem to be in crisis?</description></item><item><title>Does New Zealand need a capital gains tax? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750262/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750262/</guid><description>Podcast Description For years a capital gains tax has been a taboo political subject, avoided by politicians afraid to lose votes. Tax experts have stressed time and again that Aotearoa should follow in the footsteps of the rest of the OECD and introduce this type of tax. And while former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern refused to pull the trigger despite strong recommendations from the working group her own Government commissioned, there’s speculation that this political hot potato could be reconsidered under Chris Hipkins’ fresh leadership.</description></item><item><title>What is co-governance and why is it dividing and confusing politicians? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750263/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750263/</guid><description>Podcast Description The issue of co-governance has become a lightning rod over the last 12 months. New Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has acknowledged a backlash against the ideas of co-governance and has even owned up to the Labour Government stuffing up its messaging around the idea.
The widely misunderstood term was given massive prominence when combined with the Three Waters scheme. It galvanised opposition to what could otherwise have been seen as a rather dull but necessary water management plan.</description></item><item><title>How the 2023 election is shaping up to be the tightest race in years | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750264/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750264/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has had a chaotic start to his time in office, with the flooding in Auckland adding to the growing list of woes the Government faces. However, two polls this week have given a beleaguered Labour Party some good news – with Hipkins and his party narrowly ahead of Christopher Luxon and National.

With the country forecast to enter a recessionary period, a cost of living crisis, declining house prices and a mortgage shock on the horizon, the next 12 months don’t look easy for New Zealanders. On top of this, the distribution of wealth across Aotearoa continues to favour those who already have most.

Aotearoa’s voting age could be lowered for the first time in nearly 50 years. In November, the Supreme Court declared the current voting age of 18 was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, opening the door for a law change.

At the start of this century, New Zealand was considered one of the most literate countries in the world.

It comes after years of growing acceptance of the Māori name for our islands, seeking to reverse a name assigned to the country by Dutch explorers 500 years ago.
The petition comes during a growing embracement of Māori culture in public life – but with that acceptance has come an unsurprising pushback from those happy with how things are.</description></item><item><title>The polls have him on top - but does Chris Luxon have what it takes to be PM? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750288/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750288/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Front Page is revisiting some of the major stories of 2022. After a tumultuous period of upheaval, leadership coups and scandals, the National Party has enjoyed a period of far greater stability over the last 12 months.
This has been reflected in the poll numbers, which have seen the party steadily rise under the leadership of Christopher Luxon. But Luxon is far from the finished political product.

Labour has celebrated five years in government, but recent polling suggests securing a third term will be a battle.

But a change in approach from Russia means many Ukrainians are in for a cold, dark Christmas. Today, Damien speaks to New Zealand journalist Tom Mutch, who has spent most of the year in Ukraine covering the war, but has just arrived back in Aotearoa</description></item><item><title>Covid is spiking again - will it ruin our summer holidays? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750296/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750296/</guid><description>Podcast Description Covid-19 has continued to be a dark shadow hanging heavy over everything that has happened in 2022 - and it seems that this disease is not yet done with us. Cases are tracking up and dozens of New Zealanders are continuing to die weekly. So how worrying is the rise in cases amid waning immunity and more relaxed behaviour over the summer holidays? And what long-term strategy does the Government have in place to deal with the ongoing threat of Covid-19?</description></item><item><title>Year in Politics - how the parties performed, and what's in store for 2023 | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750297/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750297/</guid><description>Podcast Description The political year is coming to an end, and what a year it has been. Rogue MPs, shock resignations, and legislative controversies have dominated headlines for both sides of the House this year.

Scammers operate in teams outside of Aotearoa, creating elaborate schemes that could catch even the most tech-savvy among us.
So how do these scams work? Do victims have any chance of getting their money back once it leaves their accounts?

Harry and Meghan will follow the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and document their new lives in Los Angeles, and the fallout from their departure as working British royals.

This time the Government has had to back down on an entrenchment clause that would have made it more difficult for future governments to alter the legislation.
The move has been dubbed 'absolute chaos' by National Party leader Christopher Luxon, and further muddies the water around an already controversial proposal.
So what would the entrenchment clause have done, how did it make it into the bill in the first place, and why was it originally considered necessary?</description></item><item><title>Rebuilding Better - How can we unite our divided society? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750303/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750303/</guid><description>Podcast Description The NZ Herald has kicked off the next stage in its project, The New New Zealand – Rebuilding Better.
This time, as chosen by readers, the focus is on the social division our country is experiencing.
Some of that disunity stems from the level of disinformation that was bubbling under the surface of polite society but boiled over in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
So why are people still protesting outside courts and hospitals?</description></item><item><title>Who is New Zealand's first person to be convicted of sabotage? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750304/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750304/</guid><description>Podcast Description Aotearoa has its first convicted saboteur. 62-year-old Graham Philip was sentenced to just over three years in jail for an attack on the National Grid in November last year.
Since laws were introduced during the Second World War, it is the first time anyone has been charged with sabotage in this country.
So what is sabotage in law, what did Philip actually do, and are there any concerns about others following the same path?</description></item><item><title>It's the holiday season - are we financially ready for it? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750305/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750305/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's December, which means the festive shopping season has just officially kicked off.
Many people may want to treat themselves and their loved ones, but with a recession due next year, there is some hesitancy around potential overspending – and official warnings to spend less this year.

He was just an anonymous millionaire running his successful business.
But then, all of a sudden, his comments referring to My Food Bag founder Nadia Lim catapulted him into the public consciousness for all the wrong reasons. NZ Herald investigative journalist Carolyne Meng-yee has been trying to secure an interview with Henry ever since those comments were made.</description></item><item><title>Employment Relations Authority: What is it and how does it work? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750307/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750307/</guid><description>Podcast Description Almost every week another story emerges about an employer behaving badly and having to make a significant payout to an employee. Most of the stories come from the dispute decisions released by the Employment Relations Authority and they provide a glimpse at what happens when things go wrong in the workplace. So are New Zealand employers particularly badly behaved?

The average gap is so significant that women are ostensibly working for free from today when compared to their male counterparts.

The Government is consulting Aucklanders on if they want a bridge or tunnel across the Waitemata Harbour to go alongside the existing bridge. It comes after years of back and forth on ideas for crossings, while those using the existing Harbour Bridge contend with an aging infrastructure prone to closures. So why does it take so long to get these major projects off the ground in Aotearoa?</description></item><item><title>Chris Hipkins talks ram raids, gangs and crime in NZ | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750310/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750310/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ram raids, gang wars, random attacks, school lockdowns, domestic violence – the news cycle has been endless, and it has rarely painted Government crime policies in good light. The National Party has put it top of the agenda ahead of the 2023 election, promising to punish youth offenders and hitting out at Labour’s crime policies as ‘kumbaya’. The man in charge of that for the Government is Police Minister Chris Hipkins, who was appointed to the portfolio back in June when ram raids were at their peak.</description></item><item><title>From Twitter to FTX - what's going on with big tech and their big egos? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750311/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750311/</guid><description>Podcast Description The last few weeks have not been good to the superstars of the tech industry. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has dominated headlines for weeks after finally completing his purchase of social media giant Twitter, and subsequently overseeing a mass departure of staff and the breakdown of the platform he bought.

Since Luxon took over, the party has become more stable and steadily risen in the polls. But his tenure hasn’t been without its mishaps.
He has dealt with MP controversies, made his own public gaffes, and there are still serious questions about National’s policies in the lead-up to next year's election. Today, Damien is joined Newstalk ZB chief political reporter Aaron Dahmen for his analysis of the big political battle shaping up for 2023.</description></item><item><title>The state of Russia-Ukraine conflict after Poland missile strike | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750314/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750314/</guid><description>Podcast Description As Europe heads into the cold winter months, there still no indication of the war between Russia and Ukraine coming to an end.
The Ukrainian army has made major advances and taken back much of their country.

It’s an ominous warning for our summer months, the time when New Zealanders head to the waves to seek relief from the scorching sun. Water safety remains a massive problem in Aotearoa.

Most anticipated a red wave to sweep over the nation, with the Republicans expected to take both the house and the senate after waging a campaign centred on spreading the false narrative that the 2020 election was rigged. But things haven’t played out like that.

This has led to criticism from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who said it was wrong for banks to be making massive profits at a time when New Zealanders are struggling to make ends meet.
Stable banks have long been seen as integral to the economy, but do the current profits go too far? And if so, what can we do to address this issue, in a way that doesn’t harm economic stability in Aotearoa?</description></item><item><title>How did Rotorua become the centre of an emergency housing crisis? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750322/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750322/</guid><description>Podcast Description Frustrations are growing in Rotorua about the state of emergency housing.

A string of poor results had fans baying for the blood of coach Ian Foster, who somehow managed to survive. On the surface, New Zealand Rugby appeared to back Foster, but the uncovering of a number of covert meetings suggests that Crusaders coach Scott ‘Razor’ Roberston came far closer to landing the job than previously known.</description></item><item><title>Health system hit by growing wait times - is there an easy fix? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750330/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750330/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealand’s health system is facing yet another crisis. Figures show that some people are waiting over six hours for emergency treatment at hospitals, while others are facing year long waits to book surgeries. While the health system is still recovering from Covid-caused delays, Opposition parties and the public want to see change now. But is a quick fix even possible in our underfunded and overburdened healthcare system? Today, Dr Deborah Powell, national secretary of the New Zealand Resident Doctors Association, joins Damien to get a health professional’s perspective on what’s going on with our wait times.</description></item><item><title>Why is New Zealand reluctant to address family and domestic violence epidemic? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750331/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750331/</guid><description>Podcast Description It’s no secret that the media loves to focus on crime, with robberies and violence grabbing easy headlines across the nation.

Incels, as they are better known, aren’t choosing to abstain of their own volition.
Instead, they blame society, and particularly women, for denying them the opportunity for sexual relationships. While this anger has stayed online for the most part, it has been blamed for acts of real world violence. So what exactly are incels?

After a month of chaos sparked by a mini-budget that crashed the pound, Truss has resigned, sparking a truncated leadership contest in an attempt to right the ship. So how did her reign go so wrong – and is there any salvaging of the UK’s Conservative Party after 12 years in office?</description></item><item><title>Looking at the state of the Labour Party after five years in power | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750336/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750336/</guid><description>Podcast Description On October 19th 2017, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters threw support behind the New Zealand Labour Party, making Jacinda Ardern our 40th Prime Minister and ending nine years of National rule. Labour has gone through plenty of highs and lows over the last five years, but half a decade on, the party seems to be facing its most perilous period in power yet. A rogue backbench MP, a brewing economic nightmare, and growing attacks against some key policies are seeing the party dip in the polls.</description></item><item><title>How a Shakespeare funding decision made global headlines | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750337/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750337/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealand has cancelled William Shakespeare. At least, that’s what you’d believe if you read some of the headlines this week. The latest round of Creative New Zealand funding decisions sparked global outrage after the Shakespeare Globe Centre of New Zealand missed out on funding. But after initial backlash against Creative New Zealand, it appears the outrage was blown out of proportion – and covered up some more serious issues with the latest round of funding.</description></item><item><title>Global recession predicted for 2023 - how hard will economic storm affect you? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750338/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750338/</guid><description>Podcast Description The economic mood around the world is turning gloomier. Economists and bankers have conceded that the fight against inflation is going to take longer than expected – and this also applies to New Zealand.

In doing so, he joins an influential group of spin doctors who promise influence over and access to some of the biggest decision makers in the country.
Faafoi’s quick transition from Government to lobbying has led to questions about whether we should be allowing this at all. So how much sway do lobbyists actually have?</description></item><item><title>Bird of the Year returns - the endangered birds that need your support | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750340/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750340/</guid><description>Podcast Description One of the nation’s most anticipated elections is back for another year. The two-week voting period for Bird of the Year kicks off today, one year after the race made global headlines when the top prize went (confusingly) to a bat.

However, a new report from Oxfam has ranked New Zealand one hundred and thirty-sixth in the world on our distribution of wealth.
So while some want to see tax cuts across the board, including for the very rich, the other end of the spectrum wants to a new tax to break that concentration of wealth.</description></item><item><title>Should we follow the US and decriminalise cannabis possession? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750342/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750342/</guid><description>Podcast Description US President Joe Biden has announced federal pardons for those convicted of cannabis possession, wiping clean a criminal record that may have made it difficult to get a job or accommodation after serving out their sentence. Like the United States, Aotearoa’s drug convictions are tilted heavily against one ethnic group. In their case African-Americans, in our case Māori are much more likely to be prosecuted for drug-related offenses.

Will it significantly curtail climate change? And will farmers be able to manage the financial pressure added to their load?

The former mayor of the Far North says his win gives him a mandate for change, with key policies focused on shaking up council-controlled organisations and cutting costs. But how exactly will he deliver on those promises?

The excitement is tangible for the growing legion of fans who enjoy following their sporting idols.

Dozens of livestock have fallen, and August saw a man tragically lose his life to pack of dogs.
This terrifying problem has been caused by a combination of feral and roaming dogs.

Reports at time suggested that they were sex workers and gang affiliated. Now, the release of a 700-page file into the case has revealed that wasn't true, and has detailed the bureaucratic blunder behind the case. One of the women is now calling for an apology from the Government for the claims she says were fabricated about her.</description></item><item><title>Why major global brands are flocking to New Zealand | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750372/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750372/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealand may be a small country at the bottom of the world, but some of the major retail brands that we’ve heard about for decades have started eyeing up our islands. Costco, Ikea, and a range of fashion brands are amongst the global icons heading our way soon. But why are they choosing to open here now, and what does it mean for local businesses?
Today, NZ Herald business reporter Aimee Shaw joins Damien for a rundown on the stores setting up shop in New Zealand, and Auckland University marketing professor Bodo Lang explains why these international brands are setting up shop here.</description></item><item><title>Why the world is watching our falling house prices | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750373/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750373/</guid><description>Podcast Description House prices have been on the slide all year, amid what economists are calling a significant correction in the housing markets.
At the same, interest rates have been rising rapidly as the Reserve Bank tries desperately to put a lid on inflation.
International observers are now referring to the New Zealand housing market as the canary down the coal mine. So how much worse could this become, what does this mean for first-home buyers with low equity and what happens if New Zealand slides into a recession?</description></item><item><title>Should we be dropping the last of our Covid restrictions? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750374/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750374/</guid><description>Podcast Description The world has been battling Covid-19 for nearly three years. But increasingly, people are having to learn to live with the virus. Recently, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern revealed that Cabinet will be looking at the traffic light system and if it's still fit for purpose. It comes after reports that requirements for mask mandates could be significantly narrowed. So as case numbers drop, is this the right move?

This result left them second from bottom and marked the conclusion of one of the worst seasons in the team’s history. Despite the stormy season, more than 20,000 fans still crammed in Mt Smart Stadium to watch the final match, and you can rest assured they’ll be back for more next season.</description></item><item><title>The legal battle linking Hollywood, Cornwall Park and NZ's events industry | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750376/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750376/</guid><description>Podcast Description For over 100 years, New Zealanders have flocked to Auckland Showgrounds for a wide variety of events. But the doors could soon permanently close on an institution of the country’s events industry. Event operators are currently in a legal battle with the Cornwall Park Trust over the future use of the land the Showgrounds sits on – a fight that could determine the future of dozens of shows and exhibitions.</description></item><item><title>Inside the Government's u-turn over KiwiSaver reforms | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750377/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750377/</guid><description>Podcast Description 24 hours is a long time in politics.
On Tuesday, the Government tabled a bill aimed at fixing a GST imbalance between small and large KiwiSaver providers.
However, after it was reported the changes would potentially take $103 billion away from people's KiwiSaver funds by 2070, the backlash was swift and severe - and the bill was pulled on Wednesday.
So how badly did the Government handle the communication around this bill, and has some poor media relations scuppered a law change the country actually needed?</description></item><item><title>The key local election races and why you should be paying attention | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750378/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750378/</guid><description>Podcast Description Voting documents will soon be sent out, inviting enrolled New Zealanders to cast their votes in the local elections.
While this is meant to be an important part of the democratic process, participation in local elections has been woeful in recent decades, sitting at around 42 per cent.

The golden age of unions has long passed, and for many workers being a union member has become a foreign concept. But international trends suggest that’s about to change.

For his nearly four decades of service to the Labour Party, he has been rewarded with a diplomatic posting in Ireland.
But not everyone is convinced that he’s the right person to represent New Zealand on the global stage.
Assault allegations earlier in his career combined with some of his antics as Speaker have some questioning whether he has the temperament for the position.</description></item><item><title>Why are we still offering big financial incentives to Hollywood studios? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750382/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750382/</guid><description>Podcast Description The New Zealand Government has been pouring money into attracting large movie makers to Aotearoa. One of the big benefactors was the new Lord of the Rings TV show hitting Amazon Prime next week. The promise is that these incentives will create jobs, boost the economy and offer fresh marketing opportunities. But as other sectors cry out for that funding, are we getting a good return on our investment?</description></item><item><title>Is New Zealand prepared for the effects of extreme weather? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750383/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750383/</guid><description>Podcast Description Over the last week Nelson has been devastated by floods.

But while some are taking their anger to Parliament’s doorstep, there are now reports that people influenced by disinformation are contesting seats in local elections as part of their effort to make Aotearoa ‘ungovernable’.

Worryingly, we are also seeing a growing trend of offences committed by younger members of society. We rarely see a week pass without a ram raid incident.

Official Cash Rate lifts over the last 12 months have been the most aggressive the country has ever seen. And that continued this week with the Reserve Bank pushing rates up further.
The role of the Reserve Bank in firstly creating inflation and now trying to stop it has become a major political talking point. Some critics are now even suggesting that it could be a rocky road ahead if the Reserve Bank doesn’t get the balance right.</description></item><item><title>Is there a plan to fix two decades of falling literacy rates? | The Front Page</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7988750389/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7988750389/</guid><description>Podcast Description At the start of this century, New Zealand was considered one of the most literate countries in the world. However, multiple reports in recent years have shown that is no longer the case.
