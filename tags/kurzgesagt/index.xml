They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun. They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.
But maybe you have scrolled through your phone, unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort.</description></item><item><title>What Is Something？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/x9otdixatfw/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:33:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/x9otdixatfw/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.
What is a thing?
Why do things happen?
And why do they happen the way they do?
Let’s try to approach this step-by-step.
What are you made of?
You are matter which is made of molecules
which are made of atoms and those are made of elementary particles.
But if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,
what are they made of?</description></item><item><title>What’s Hiding at the Most Solitary Place on Earth？ The Deep Sea ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/paerpyendvk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:17:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/paerpyendvk/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Sometimes the world feels&amp;hellip;hmm, boring.
We&amp;rsquo;ve visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.
But there is still one place to explore.
It&amp;rsquo;s a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.
The deep sea.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive down.
[♫ Catchy Intro Jingle ♫]
When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans,
it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.</description></item><item><title>Why Don't We Shoot Nuclear Waste Into Space？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/us2z-wc9rao/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:41:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/us2z-wc9rao/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes. Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it.</description></item><item><title>Why We Should NOT Look For Aliens - The Dark Forest ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/xaujyp8tnre/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/xaujyp8tnre/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable
planets.
If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1%
of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years.
Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so
in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge</description></item><item><title>Why The War on Drugs Is a Huge Failure ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/wjuxlqnhcai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 16:29:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/wjuxlqnhcai/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Over 40 years ago, US President Richard Nixon
declared drug abuse public enemy number one,
starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.
Today, the numbers are in.
The War on Drugs is a huge failure, with devastating unintended consequences.
It led to mass incarceration in the US;
to corruption, political destabilization, and violence
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa;
to systemic human rights abuses across the world.</description></item><item><title>You Are Not Where You Think You Are ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/pj-h6mege7i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/pj-h6mege7i/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But… where is all of that? While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.
In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.</description></item><item><title>Who Invented the Internet？ And Why？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/21efwbb48se/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 15:08:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/21efwbb48se/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿So, have you ever wondered who actually invented the internet?
Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet.
But all they did was invent clever ways of using the internet.
So the person who “invented the internet” should be a gazillionaire
equivalent to, say, God, shoudn&amp;rsquo;t they?
Who should get the credit, then?
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?
Maybe.
Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?</description></item><item><title>What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qaa2o_8wbuq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:59:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qaa2o_8wbuq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Matter, as we know it;
Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and trees, rocks and us.
This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.
About 25% is dark matter; and 70% is dark energy.
Both of which are invisible.
This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is
really only a tiny fraction of reality.
But it gets worse.
We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are, or how they work.</description></item><item><title>What If We Detonated All Nuclear Bombs at Once？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/jyecrgp-sw8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:47:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/jyecrgp-sw8/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Many of our viewers have asked us a very serious question:
What if we made a big pile of bombs
and exploded every nuclear weapon in the world all at once?
Strangely enough, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good source
to answer this question to our satisfaction.
So, we gathered together a few scientists to calculate what would happen.
And find an answer to this extremely important scientific problem,</description></item><item><title>What Is Light？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ixxzrzxafeq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:27:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ixxzrzxafeq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Light, is the connection between us and the universe.
Through light, we could experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.
But, what is light?
In a nutshell
Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size
That can&amp;rsquo;t be split, only created or destroyed.
Light also has a wave-particle duality
being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time (although this is a lie)</description></item><item><title>Why Alien Life Would be our Doom - The Great Filter ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ujtogpj0urm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:11:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ujtogpj0urm/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Imagine NASA announced today that they found aliens.
Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa,
and also ancient alien ruins on Titan.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be great?
Well, no. It would be horrible news,
devastating even.
It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain
and that it might be coming soon.
Why?
Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime
be bad?</description></item><item><title>Why Blue Whales Don't Get Cancer - Peto's Paradox ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1aelonvi9wq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 13:35:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1aelonvi9wq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.
In the process of trying to understand it,
to get better at killing it,
we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day:
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,
which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.
To understand why we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.</description></item><item><title>Who Is Responsible For Climate Change？ – Who Needs To Fix It？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ipvxxxqwbqw/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:16:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ipvxxxqwbqw/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released
over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.
In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more.
That&amp;rsquo;s 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.
And it&amp;rsquo;s not just CO₂,
we&amp;rsquo;re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.</description></item><item><title>When Time Became History - The Human Era ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/cwu29prcuvq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:06:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/cwu29prcuvq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools, a pan and your garbage.
Then they bury everything in the woods. 12,000 years later an archeologist is trying to figure who you were.
What was important to you, what video games you played, what you believed in
and what informed your decisions. Because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history:
The Planetary Revolution, when humanity transitioned, becoming a multiplanetary species.</description></item><item><title>Worst Nuclear Accidents in History ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/jzfpyo-q-rm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:05:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/jzfpyo-q-rm/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people.
Ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated
to awaken seemingly unnatural powers,
creating horribly toxic elements
that if they escape, can and have killed people
in horrible ways.
How many people has nuclear energy killed and how?

There&amp;rsquo;s a visceral joy in blowing things up,
and a horrifying fascination with things like fireballs, shockwaves, and radiation.
And while it does help put our destructive power in perspective,
it&amp;rsquo;s not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t about silly stacks of TNT, or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.</description></item><item><title>What if We Nuke the Moon？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qefpbt9du60/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 11:05:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qefpbt9du60/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿What would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon?
Would the explosion knock its orbit towards earth, causing tidal waves and misery? Could
the moon be destroyed, showering the earth in a rain of meteoric death?
During the cold war the moon was a major target for space exploration and you know, military
bases. So the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear</description></item><item><title>Why Earth Is A Prison and How To Escape It ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/rvmzxh1tiiq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:11:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/rvmzxh1tiiq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿We are prisoners on Earth. The Universe taunts us, by showing all the places we can&amp;rsquo;t ever visit.
However, if our species wants to have a long term future, we have to escape our prison.
But what is keeping us here in the first place?
Turns out, we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old.

China’s population will halve by the end of the century,
the median age in Italy has reached 48.
All around the world birth rates are crashing – Is humanity dying out? What is going on and how bad is it?
For hundreds of thousands of years the human population barely grew at all, haunted by disease, famine and war until the industrial revolution – exponential progress led to exponential growth, pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the year 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later.</description></item><item><title>What If You Detonated a Nuclear Bomb In The Marianas Trench？ (Science not Fantasy) ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9tbxdgcv74c/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 08:24:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9tbxdgcv74c/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿What would happen if we detonated humanity&amp;rsquo;s most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean?
For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities,
earthquakes would level countries,
new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter.
Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart?
Or thrown out of orbit?
Well, almost.
Currently, Earth&amp;rsquo;s deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench.
The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley</description></item><item><title>What If You Fall into a Black Hole？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qqsltnkzvay/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:55:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qqsltnkzvay/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe and they are wildly
weird and complicated. What would happen if you fell inside one and what are they really?
First we need to talk about space and time: Space and time are the grand stage where the
play of the universe unfolds. But space isn’t a fixed stage and time doesn’t tick the
same for everyone everywhere.</description></item><item><title>Why Age？ Should We End Aging Forever？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/gojsr4iwcm4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:50:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/gojsr4iwcm4/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?
80 years? 90?
120?
Longer?
And do you think you&amp;rsquo;ll change your mind once you reach that age?
Fifty thousand years ago most humans died very young.
As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.
Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.</description></item><item><title>What Is Intelligence？ Where Does it Begin？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ck4rgeohfko/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:11:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ck4rgeohfko/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators to poetry to Pokemon.
All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly:
Intelligence.
We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength,
but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy.
In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems.
Especially the problem of staying alive, which involves finding food and shelter,</description></item><item><title>Why Aliens Might Already Be On Their Way To Us ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/gdsf2h9_39i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:08:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/gdsf2h9_39i/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿The universe is magnificent and vast. Hundreds of billions of galaxies, trillions of stars, and even more planets. If even the tiniest fraction are habitable, then the Universe should be teeming with life. And yet we see nothing, only vast emptiness. Where is everyone else?
The answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy: we are early, born before almost all other life – but very soon this may change.</description></item><item><title>Your Body Killed Cancer 5 Minutes Ago ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/zfhyjrqz_xk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 05:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/zfhyjrqz_xk/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Somewhere in your body, your immune system just quietly killed one of your own cells, stopping it from becoming cancer, and saving your life. It does that all the time. The vast majority of cancer cells you develop will be killed without you ever noticing. Which is an incredibly hard job because of what cancer cells are: parts of yourself that start to behave as individuals even if it hurts you.</description></item><item><title>Why Meat is the Best Worst Thing in the World 🍔 ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/nxvqpzrg2wg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 05:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/nxvqpzrg2wg/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Humans love meat.
Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things!
Eating meat has become so trivial that many people
don&amp;rsquo;t consider something a proper meal if there&amp;rsquo;s no animal involved.
Which is pretty amazing,
since only a few decades ago meat was a luxury product.
Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.
Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the most inefficient way of feeding humans.</description></item><item><title>Why Are You Alive – Life, Energy &amp; ATP ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qimcld9yube/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 04:38:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qimcld9yube/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.
You probably don&amp;rsquo;t feel it, but there&amp;rsquo;s an incredible amount of activity

Physicist Erwin Schrödinger defined life this way:
Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium.
What does this mean?
Let’s pretend that your download folder is the universe.
It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.
By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.
This is what living things do.
But what is life?</description></item><item><title>Why Black Holes Could Delete The Universe – The Information Paradox ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ywo-cvgetrq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 02:06:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ywo-cvgetrq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe, strong enough to rip whole stars into atom sized pieces
Well, this is scary enough. They have an even more powerful and dark property: they might delete the universe itself.

Landscapes, faces, fine art, or epic architecture; stars in the sky.
Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle.
Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling.
If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its color, shape, form, or proportion
somehow are appealing or delightful to us.</description></item><item><title>Wormholes Explained – Breaking Spacetime ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9p6rdqiybaw/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 01:12:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9p6rdqiybaw/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole.
Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place.
Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window.
But are wormholes real,

We have no real metaphor for their power – if the sun were to magically go supernova it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion, every second. For weeks. While supernovae are the engines of creation, forging the elements that enable life, they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies.</description></item><item><title>What Happens If You Destroy A Black Hole？ ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/cfslusyfzpc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 23:21:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/cfslusyfzpc/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Black holes can destroy everything – but can they be destroyed?
What happens if we push physics to the absolute limits, maybe even break it and the universe
in the process?
Let’s create a tiny black hole, about the mass of our moon, in the Kurzgesagt Labs and
try to rip it apart.

Stripped to its core meaning,
consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.

It’s more interesting and weird than you probably think. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics: Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the Moon on its way to crash into us already?
We know that earth’s gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon, but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force. But there is no other force countering gravity - instead, the trick to staying up is a ‘sideways’ motion that we call an orbit.</description></item><item><title>The Beginning of Everything -- The Big Bang ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/wndggl73ihy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 23:58:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/wndggl73ihy/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿The beginning of everything.

66 million years ago, the continuity of the dinosaurs had been going on for around 165 million years already - and it didn’t seem this would change any time soon. The world was warm, and pleasant, and most of the land was covered with lush forests and an incredible diversity of trees, flowers, ferns and trillions of critters. Dinosaurs were ubiquitous and had diversified into hundreds of species of all shapes and sizes.</description></item><item><title>The Death Of Bees Explained – Parasites, Poison and Humans ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/gqa42m4rtxe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 19:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/gqa42m4rtxe/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Human society is extremely complex and fragile,
built upon various pillars.
One of them is the honey bee.
One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honey bees.

thousands of plants would follow,
which could lead to millions of people starving in the following years.

How can a virus overwhelm the very complex
defense system of the body so quickly
and so effectively?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what Ebola does.
(Theme music)
Ebola is a virus.
A virus is a very small thing.
A bit of RNA or DNA
and a few proteins
and a hull.
It has no ability to do anything
by itself whatsoever,
and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells.</description></item><item><title>The Coronavirus Explained &amp; What You Should Do ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/btn-goy9voy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 18:59:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/btn-goy9voy/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿In December 2019 the Chinese authorities

The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet:
the bacteriophage

[Intro + Music]
A phage is a virus;
not quite alive,
not quite dead.

Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies, while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium. Like the roots of some massive tree, gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense, cosmic forest. Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw materials of creation: hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies where they eventually create stars.</description></item><item><title>The Horror of the Slaver Ant ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qsbe1pd8oce/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 09:20:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qsbe1pd8oce/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Everything changed when the slaver nation attacked.

and why is it that large?
And what are stars anyway?
Things That Would Like To Be Stars
We begin our journey with Earth.
Not to learn anything,
just to get a vague sense of scale.
The smallest things that have some star-like properties
are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs.

It was a car accident.
Nothing particularly remarkable.

Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off. Trust me.
And that&amp;rsquo;s when you met me.

Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
They are really tiny. How tiny?
Compared to Mars or our own moon,
pretty tiny.
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.
Their surface area is up close to some of the smallest states on Earth,
like Luxembourg and Malta.
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,
In reality their gravitational pull isn&amp;rsquo;t even strong enough to bring them into spherical form.</description></item><item><title>The Black Hole Bomb and Black Hole Civilizations ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/ulcdocfw-by/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 07:39:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/ulcdocfw-by/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Black holes are the largest collections of pure violent energy in the universe.
If you come too close, they&amp;rsquo;ll devour you and add your energy to their collection.

Why? They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all.
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years.</description></item><item><title>The Gulf Stream Explained ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/uugrbhk2c7u/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 05:53:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/uugrbhk2c7u/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿The ocean conveyor belt and the Gulf Stream.
Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.
They determine our weather, our climate, and much more.
The ocean currents and wind systems
transport heat from the equator to the poles
and operate like a large engine for the global climate.
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.</description></item><item><title>The (Second) Deadliest Virus ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/kr57ax0owmk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 05:33:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/kr57ax0owmk/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us as the variola virus, responsible for smallpox. The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally. It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature, all made possible by… cows. Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.</description></item><item><title>The Immune System Explained I – Bacteria Infection ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/zqgocoubi6s/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 04:56:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/zqgocoubi6s/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Every second of your life, you are under attack.
Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home,
so our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators
to protect you from&amp;hellip;well&amp;hellip;dying.
For this video, let&amp;rsquo;s assume the immune system has 12 different jobs. For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc.

But humans have always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendents.</description></item><item><title>The 12,019 Calendar IS HERE – A new calendar for humanity ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/fab41ttgs54/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 04:27:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/fab41ttgs54/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿It&amp;rsquo;s the most wonderful time of the year again!

It will probably be a red dwarf; a tiny kind of star.
That&amp;rsquo;s also one of our best bets to find alien life, and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.
So, what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?
At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs.</description></item><item><title>The History and Future of Everything -- Time ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2xkv6ipv2y0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 03:34:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2xkv6ipv2y0/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Time makes sense in small pieces.
But when you look at huge stretches of time,
it’s almost impossible to wrap your head around things.
So let’s start small
with minutes, hours, days.
You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working,
with some coffee in there somewhere.

Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years,
but it will happen. On a universal time scale, stars like our sun will be gone in no time.
Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective:
the corpses of dead stars&amp;hellip;
white dwarfs.
They could be humanity&amp;rsquo;s last home right before the death of the universe.</description></item><item><title>The 12,020 Human SPACE Era Calendar 🚀 ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/f9uz0rejijo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:47:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/f9uz0rejijo/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿It&amp;rsquo;s the most wonderful time of the year!

There&amp;rsquo;s never any good news.
Only graphs that get more and more red and angry.
Almost every year breaks some horrible record,

It&amp;rsquo;s endless,
and relentless.
We&amp;rsquo;ve known for decades that rapid climate change has been caused by the release of greenhouse gases.
But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO₂ than in the year 2000.</description></item><item><title>Iraq Explained -- ISIS, Syria and War ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/aqplredw-ro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 23:29:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/aqplredw-ro/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Oh dear… Just when you thought the Iraq problem was solved

means that many aspects of our lives

It feels like a huge bureaucracy is making decisions over our heads.
Many Europeans think

until new discoveries brought us more food,
and made us live longer.
In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.</description></item><item><title>Loneliness ｜ Kurzgesagt</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/n3xv_g3g-ma/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 19:46:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/n3xv_g3g-ma/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿Everybody feels lonely from time to time

What does measles actually do, and should you vaccinate against it?
Or is this just hysteria?
Measles is a virus:
a hull of proteins, RNA,
plus some more proteins for reproduction.
It cannot reproduce by itself; it needs a host cell to do so.
To understand measles, we have to understand the immune system.

No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It is an expression of culture, our parents&amp;rsquo; love and a means of celebration or comfort.

Or, should we end it?
Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements.
Everything considered: Is its existence good or bad for Europeans?
Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU, we&amp;rsquo;ll mostly treat it as if it&amp;rsquo;s no longer part of the club.

To answer this question,
humans come up with stories to describe the world.
We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away.
But the more we learn,
the more complicated and weird our stories become.
Some of them so much so,
that it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to know what they&amp;rsquo;re actually about.

Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were eager to make the fear go away.
So we demanded more security.

For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons,
the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.
Since the 1960&amp;rsquo;s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially,
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just because animals taste great,
it was pure necessity.
Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors relied on less available and meat bridged that gap.

While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness.
How does homeopathy work?
How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it?
The first principle of homeopathy is &amp;ldquo;like cures like.&amp;rdquo;
