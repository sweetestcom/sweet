Once beer-swilling rugby players, my guests on this week’s episode are identical twins Stephen and David, who now make up&amp;nbsp;The Happy Pear. They share their incredible journey into healthy vegan living and talk about their desire to start a health food revolution – with the goal of making healthy food and lifestyle mainstream. It all started with a small humble vegetable shop and they now own a chain of natural food shops and cafés in Ireland as well as having their own plant-based food range in the UK.</description></item><item><title>#37 How Our Childhood Shapes Every Aspect of Our Health with Dr. Gabor Maté | Feel Better, Live More with Dr Rangan Chatterjee</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8452440377/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8452440377/</guid><description>Podcast Description “We live in a society that generates addiction in most of its members.”
&amp;nbsp;

But it’s not always the conventionally popular people who fare the best, for the simple reason that there is more than one type of popularity: the first based on status and the second based on likeability.</description></item><item><title>#33 The Gut-Brain Connection and Why Diversity is Key with Miguel Toribio-Mateas | Feel Better, Live More with Dr Rangan Chatterjee</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8452440381/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8452440381/</guid><description>Podcast Description “Nutrition doesn’t need to be super-expensive, it can be cheap and cheerful but also very nutritious and wholesome.”
