        <description>Podcast Description In the past decade, podcasting has taken the world by storm. The advent of smartphones and the ground-breaking podcast &#39;Serial&#39; would see podcasting surge in popularity.
In 2020 alone over a million new shows were launched. But does it have a future? Some are not convinced.
In the second and final part of my series on the history of podcasting I look at how podcasting became so popular and where it’s heading.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description ‘You might not be a revolutionary, but you are living through a revolution.’&amp;nbsp;
Podcasting is much older than you might imagine. A decade before the true crime show Serial took the world by storm, creators were making some of the earliest shows. &amp;nbsp;
This podcast is a nostalgic trip through the early days of the internet in Ireland when podcasting emerged. Brian Greene who was making shows in the mid 2000s shares his memories of the early days of podcasting.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s a dark evening in early November 1847.
A carriage makes it&#39;s way through lawless starving countryside in North Roscommon.
A gun shot rings out, a man falls dead.
A family mourns but a community rejoices.
While the Great Hunger of the 1840s resulted in one million deaths, this one murder encapsulated the stark choices facing that generation of Irish people in a one gripping story. It is retold in this episode.</description>

This sleepy corner of Georgia gained notoriety in the later stages of the US Civil War when the Confederacy opened a prison camp there. Nearly one third of all prisoners who entered Andersonville never left.&amp;nbsp;
Among their number were hundreds of Irish men. This podcast tells their stories.

        <description>Podcast Description Writing histories of people who led secret lives is difficult because they leave few records. Yet that is precisely what my guest in today’s show has done. In this podcast, Dr Maurice Casey, shares the fascinating history of Rose McKenna and Sydney Arnold and how he uncovered their secret lives.
In the early 20th century, this Latvian-Irish couple participated in two revolutions in Ireland and Russia. While Rose tried to arms for the IRA in London, they were also contemporaries of Ho Chi Minh when they lived in Moscow.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As we prepare to celebrate Halloween, this episode is a timely exploration of the history of the supernatural in Ireland.
Ghosts have long played an important role in Irish history and culture. In this podcast I am joined by Dr Clodagh Tait, a historian of the supernatural. Our conversation focuses on a specific type of ghost referred to as a crisis apparition. These usually appeared far from home, often informing an emigrant about an imminent death in their family.</description>

As I explain, I recently listened back to this episode after a chance meeting with my guest Cormac Leonard. The episode on the history of the Deaf community is the definition of forgotten history. Until recently the community was largely ignored by historians.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1923 as the Irish revolution came to an end, large parts of the North Roscommon town of Arigna lay in ruins. While war and revolution had swept across Ireland over the previous years few places shared Arigna’s unique experience. When workers occupied local coalmines demanding better working conditions this began years of intense and bitter conflict with the authorities. This is the story of the Arigna Soviet You can find Oisín Ó Drisceoil&#39;s essay on the Arigna Soviet in Labour HIstory in Irish History here.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the turn of the 20th century alcoholism was a major problem in Irish society. The island had 17,300 pubs while around 40% of all prison sentences were alcohol related. There was a general sense alcohol addiction was out of control. The stereotype of the happy-go-lucky drunk certainly masked the reality of the Irish alcoholism.
In this podcast I explore addiction in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century by focusing on the life of one woman - the Sligo native Sarah Garvey.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1821 George IV was the first British monarch to visit Ireland in modern times. It was a historic occasion for multiple reasons. Not only was he the first king to set foot on Irish soil since the 17th century but he was the first to do so without an army.
Many held out hope the king&#39;s arrival might usher in a new era in Irish history.
However George himself had other ideas.</description>

This podcast follows the life one of the last survivors in Dublin - Catherine Mulhern.

        <description>Podcast Description In 1984, the Conservative Party, lead by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, gathered in the seaside town of Brighton for their annual conference. In the early hours of October 12th a bomb ripped through the Grand Hotel where Thatcher and several other conservative leaders were staying. The following day the Provisional IRA would claim responsibility for the attack. This triggered one of the largest manhunts in history. While the plan was audacious, the police operation to catch the IRA team that planted the bomb was extraordinary.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode needs a bit of an introduction. While the term Rotten Prod, short for Rotten Protestant, sounds like a sectarian slur, the phrase has a very different and fascinating history. It actually originated within the Protestant community in Ulster to describe a person considered disloyal to Unionism. At the turn of the 20th century, the majority of Ulster Protestants were Unionists, meaning they supported Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Believe it or not, it was a crime to sell contraception in Ireland between 1935 and 1979. The Irish government also banned all literature on family planning for decades as well. This had a profound impact on life in Ireland. Couples couldn&#39;t plan families or engage in recreational sex without fear of pregnancy. This devastated relationships and left many people with a very limited understanding of sex and pregnancy.</description>

In December 1849 her image (pictured in the episode artwork and here) appeared in The Illustrated London News. Over the following decades she became the face of the Great Famine. Today she is one of the most recognisable women in Irish history, but who was Bridget O’Donnel?
Is it possible she never existed but was the creation of an artist called James Mahony?</description>

However while it has the potential to sustain or destroy life, our ability to accurately forecast it is very recent. In this podcast I am joined by meteorologists Evelyn Cusack and Noel Fitzpatrick to explain the fascinating history of weather forecasting.

        <description>Podcast Description The 1950s were a dismal time in Ireland. While the economy tanked, the catholic church, at the height of its power, maintained strict control over social life. Desperate to find a better life, nearly 500,000 Irish people emigrated. This staggering figure was equivalent to 80% of those born in the Free State between 1931 and 1941. This was a level of emigration unseen since the days of the Great Hunger of the 1840s.</description>

Niamh is an expert on 19th century law and she explains how the process worked before DNA, forensics or even the concept of a trial by a jury of our peers existed!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over the last decade there has been countless events to mark the centenary of the Irish Revolution. However 2022 is also the 175th anniversary of Black ‘47, one of worst years of the Great Hunger. This has received little or no attention.&amp;nbsp;This begs the question does the Great Famine matter anymore or is it fading in to the distant past?
In this podcast I looked at the impact of the Great Famine, asking what if any meaning it has for day to day life in the 21st century.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Traditional music is central to Irish culture and identity in the 21st century. Contrary to what we might think, this is a relatively recent development. As late as the 1960s Trad was perceived as unfashionable and musicians were not allowed to play in pubs.&amp;nbsp;
60 years later it has become extremely popular and recognised the world over. So what happen?
Last weekend I sat down with Tom Mulligan, a legend in Trad scene to talk about the history of Trad over the century.</description>

The show begins by looking what an actual native Irish woodland because woodlands and forests looked very different in the past. Then we embark on a journery through 12,500 years of our history. From the distant past when 80% of the island was covered with forests through to the 1920s when there was scarcely a single tree in the Irish landscape, the story of our woodlands and forests is interwoven with the history of humans on the island.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1888 Ireland&#39;s most unusual railway, the Lartigue monorail, opened for business. Although largely forgotten, the story of this unique train is intriguing. Operating between the 1880s and the 1920s, it carried everything from tourists to livestock.
This show (recorded in Listowel, Co Kerry) explains how this train inspired by camels in the Sahara went onto support an early form of mass tourism in the west of Ireland.&amp;nbsp;</description>

With George V due to arrive on June 22nd over 10,000 troops&amp;nbsp;were drafted into Belfast in a massive security operation. What unfolded was unquestionably the most significant royal visit to Ireland since the 17th century.</description>

At the age of 18 he fought in the Civil War alongside Dan Breen in Tipperary. The harrowing violence he witnessed in the conflict permanently scarred him and challenges the romanticised myths that often surround the life of Dan Breen.

However it is now owned by the National Museum of Ireland and houses millions of artifacts amassed over the decades.&amp;nbsp;This fascinating complex, which measures over 200,000 sq feet, is not open to the public.</description>

For nearly 250 years their relationship has been the source of intense speculation. Some claim they were&amp;nbsp;Ireland’s first openly lesbian couple. Others insist they just kindred spirits.</description>

In this interview Teresa spoke candidly about her life. She grew up in a Liverpool where racism was common and many Irish families ostracised mixed race family members. However her grandfather Luke Bernard was very different as Teresa explains he was &#39;a forward thinking man&#39;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode introduces two forgotten but remarkable revolutionaries -&amp;nbsp;Margaret and Rose Quinn. These two sisters operated a secret IRA prison from their home in a Dublin suburb. This was part of wider attempts to solve the problem of growing lawlessness in Ireland by the summer of 1920.
As British authority disintegrated in rural areas someone had to maintain law and order. This would see a revolutionary justice system established, however it raised fundamental questions for the revolutionaries - where did crime end and revolutionary activity begin.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Do beaches have a history? They very rarely feature in history books, however some of the most important chapters in our past began on beaches.
This episode was recorded at Passage East in Co Waterford. This beach is arguably one of the most important historic landscapes on the island. The Norman Invasion began here as both Strongbow and Henry II made landfall at Passage East.
In this episode I look at the history of beaches, why they are often overlooked by historians and the fascainting story of how the Norman Invasion began at Passage East .</description>

In this episode I am joined by D.J. Walsh and Eoin Tabb, the hosts of the podcast Snugcast, to see how this account shapes up against our experiences of the Black Death.&amp;nbsp;
While the Black Death was far more deadly, some of our reactions to Covid-19 are surprisingly similar to how our medieval ancestors reacted to the plague.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Cork is known as the rebel county. From late 1919 it earned this adage as some of the most bitter fighting in the War of Independence took place in Cork city and county.&amp;nbsp;This episode begins with the story of Eilis MacCurtain whose husband Tomas was Cork&#39;s first republican Lord Mayor and the Commander of the Cork No.1 Brigade of the IRA.&amp;nbsp;
In the second part of the show we head to West Cork and the mountainous terrain of the Beara Peninsula where the crown forces faced relentless opposition from the republican movement.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The story of the War of Independence in the North of Ireland is often overlooked. This obscures the fact that Belfast was the most violent place in Ireland during the conflict. However it was a very different war when compared to the experience of other parts of the island.&amp;nbsp;
This podcast explains the war in the north and why, contrary to popular misconceptions, the IRA were not the force they were elsewhere.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the latest installment of the War of Independence series I am joined by historian Liz Gills to talk about women and the Irish revolution. While numerous Irish women from revolutionaries to unionists have been covered in the series to date, in this fascinating interview, Liz provides wider context to their involvement in the conflict.
She explains how women were pivotal in establishing Ireland’s revolutionary movement and how many women although often overlooked in later histories played essential roles in the conflict.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As Easter approached in 1920 many politicians in Britain feared a major uprising in Ireland along the lines of the 1916 Rising. While the IRA had a major operation planned it was one that took the authorities off guard. Indeed the Spring of 1920 saw a surge in republican activity as prisoners across Ireland and Britain went on hunger strike which in turn lead to a general strike. Meanwhile the scale of individual IRA attacks increased.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description To date the War of Independence series has focused largely on the republican movement. This episode however looks at how the British government and their representatives in Ireland viewed the conflict.&amp;nbsp;
While the show follows those in the highest office in the land, this is&amp;nbsp;not stuffy office politics. By December 1919 the IRA were preparing an attack on the most powerful British figure on the island - the Viceroy - Lord John French.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode we move south to the Cork town of Fermoy. While most clashes in the war to date have seen the IRA pitted against police constables, this episode will see British Army soldiers enter the fray. These battle hardened veterans from the First World War pose a very different threat to Royal Irish Constabulary.&amp;nbsp;The show also introduces some famous figures including Liam Lynch arguably one of the most influential IRA commander during the war and also Winston Churchill.</description>

The episode is based around the story of Edward Murray, a young Dubliner who played a key role in these events.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description One of the first major challenges facing the Irish government after Independence in 1922 was how to police the country. The Royal Irish Constabulary which had existed under British rule was a highly discredited force so they established the Civic Guard which later developed into An Garda Síochána.&amp;nbsp;In this episode, I interview Dr Vicky Conway who reveals the complex history of An Garda Síochána from its early years when a mutiny rocked the force through to the Troubles.</description>

You will hear stories from a 19th century mental asylum, visit a medieval hospital, walk down a medieval street, hear the strange story of a dog whose death symbolised an epoch of Irish history and finish with the story of a forgotten hero.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Recently I discovered that my great great grandmother Catherine Murphy lost her sister and her daughter within two days of each other in February 1919 during the Great Flu pandemic. This highlighted how disease has long been part of our history. For this episode I decided to catch up with the historian John Dorney who recently published an article on the history of epidemics in Ireland. You can find John&#39;s article on epidemics in Ireland and also his great podcast the Irish History Show at theIrishstory.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Irish coffee industry generates hundreds of million of euros every year. This is a pretty recent development - when I was growing up in the 1980s and 1990s the only coffee available was instant coffee.&amp;nbsp;
However Ireland&#39;s relationship with coffee did not begin in the last 20 years. If anything this is the second or even third wave of coffee culture to hit this country. In this show I Iook at the early history of coffee tracing the origins of the drink in Ireland back to the 17th century</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Land has been the cause of some of the most vicious feuds and brutal murders in modern irish history. Often portrayed as the poor tenant farmer against powerful landlords, the real stories were often more complex. In a society where people developed what was an unhealthy obsession with land there were all too many willing to kill friends family and neighbours over it.&amp;nbsp;
The sentiments which fuelled this were epitomised in John B Keane play and later an Oscar nominated movie The Field, where the central the Bull McCabe who commits murders over land says&amp;nbsp;</description>

Rumours of hidden Nazi treausre from World War II was headline news while a Third World War with the Soviet Union seemed imminent.

        <description>Podcast Description This history of Dunmore cave is mysterious and gripping. Around the year 930 the Vikings massacred large numbers of people in a battle fought around the cave. By the 18th century some of the earliest explorers found large numbers of human remains scattered across this extensive tunnel system. While this may be evidence of a brutal Viking massacre, recent archaeological excavations and analysis have suggested the full story may be more complex.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When creating episodes I normally try to tell wider events in Irish history by focusing on the lives of an individual person. This podcast takes a different approach. I interview Dr Mark Clinton about the history of one specific place - Carrickmines Castle. Mark lead the excavations that unearthed the ruins of the castle destroyed in the 17th century.
By focusing on this castle we were able to have a wide ranging conversation that covers centuries of history.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Mater Hospital in Dublin first opened its doors in 1861. It has a fascinating although often forgotten history. From using cocaine as pain relief in the 19th century to treating the wounded of the 1916 Rising, the hospital has always been a fascinating place.
Strange as it sounds, it is also where I first came up with the idea to start podcasting. In 2010 having been diagnosed with Crohn&#39;s disease I was unable to work and to keep myself occupied I started making this show.</description>

Born in 1892 into one of Cork&#39;s wealthiest families, she rejected the privilege this life offered her. She first became a radical republican playing a key role in the War of Independence before becoming a communist in the 1920s. This podcast tells her story.

The castle was home to the Marquis &amp;amp; Marchioness of Ormonde, who had invited what was considered the elite of Kilkenny to the ball.&amp;nbsp;
However behind the finery and wealth on display we will see how the Great Famine continued to affect life in Ireland into the 1850s.</description>

While his identity remains a mystery, these murders have haunted our imaginations ever since. The case has spawned an entire industry with countless books, films and podcasts along with a disturbing and crass tourist industry in London.
In spite of all this coverage, most of us know very little history about the case.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Divorce and sex magic are not things we associate with medieval Ireland. However for over one thousand years Irish society was governed by a unique and radically different legal system called Brehon Law. In this podcast I interview Dr Gillian Kenny (twitter.com/medievalgill) who explains what Brehon Law was and how it worked. She challenges widely held misconceptions and explains how divorce existed in medieval Ireland given it was banned in modern Ireland until 1995!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This subject needs little by way of an introduction. It is one of the most controversial debates in Irish history. It continues to overshadow relations with our nearest neighbour - Great Britain.
In the 1840s one million Irish people died and another million famine refugees fled the island. The Irish population fell by 25% in less than a decade.
Over the past 25 years calls for the Great Famine to be defined as a genocide have gained in popularity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description During the Great Hunger over 250,000 people were evicted by their landlords. Most of these people were left destitute with little hope in an Ireland decimated by the Great Famine. In this podcast I look at the struggle that took place between tenants and landlords in the final phase of the Great Hunger. The show tries to understand why landlords and their agents acted in such a ruthless manner and why the government in London actually encouraged this process.</description>

However this only tells part of the story.&amp;nbsp;This podcast takes you on a journey deep into one of Dublin&#39;s most notorious slums - St Michan&#39;s. There we follow the lives of a poor couple George and Bridget Shea.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Hellfire club is an 18th century ruin in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. The building has a scandalous history and is considered by some to be one of Ireland&#39;s most haunted locations. A few years ago Neil Jackman of Abarta Heritage led an archaeological excavation on the site. This podcast is an interview with Neil. He reveals the history behind this building, where the folklore and mythology originates and what he uncovered in the course of his excavations.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When we think of Irish Emigrants in the USA, images of New York or Boston spring to mind. However on a recent trip to the US I visited friends in Nebraska where I found a very different Irish American history.
Located in the midwest - the landcape and climate in Nebraska are pretty extreme - its very different from the large cities on the Eastern Coast.
In this podcast I look at how Irish emigrants survived on the Great Plains in the 1870s and 1880s.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1892 Peig Sayers married &amp;amp; moved from Dunquin in West Kerry to the Great Blasket Island. Her life provides us with fascinating insights into what marriage was like in the late 19th century (a combination of a first date and moving in with your in laws!).
Peig&#39;s later life also details how events like the 1916 Rising, the Great War and the War of Independence played out on this remote island.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Peig Sayers died in 1958, she as regarded as one of Ireland&#39;s greatest storytellers and folklorists.
Born in Dunquin in 1873 Co Kerry she grew up in the aftermath of the Great Famine in extreme poverty. However life in this remote corner of Ireland is both fascinating and at times unbelievable from a 21st century standpoint.
Later in her life Peig would recall the intriguing details of what is now a lost world.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In April 1894 Cincinnati&#39;s Irish Amercian community was rocked by a shocking and brutal murder. It was so scandalous that many newspapers in Ireland refused to even mention it, even though both the victim and the perpetrator were both Irish.
In this podcast you will hear the extraordinary story of Mollie Gilmartin unearthed for the first time in over a century...

        <description>Podcast Description The city of Kilkenny was rocked by the notorious witchcraft trial of 1324 (covered in the last two episodes). These events took place seven centuries ago in the long distant past. To conclude the series on the trial embarked on my own witch hunt in the 21st century. I wanted to find if anything remained of the supposed witch Alice Kyteler who disappeared in 1324.
I took a recorder and soon found myself in buildings Alice herself used to frequent.</description>

This show picks up the story as the trial and surrounding scandal began in March 1324. This would see the Bishop Ossory clash with Alice Kyteler and her powerful but dangerous allies. The consequences would be devastating for those caught in the middle.

        <description>Podcast Description Growing up in Kilkenny I was surrounded by medieval history - its what drew me to study the past in the first place.
One of the most famous or perhaps notorious incidents in Kilkenny&#39;s medieval history took place in 1324 when the Bishop of Ossory accused Alice Kyteler, a powerful merchant in the city, of heresy and witchraft. This sparked a lethal struggle in the town that would end in shocking brutality.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description 1848 was a year of revolt &amp;amp; rebellion across Europe and Ireland was no different. However unique to Ireland, the 1848 uprising took place to the back drop of one of the worst famine’s in modern history – the Great Hunger.
While it has been overshadowed by the much larger 1798 rebellion and the 1916 Rising, the story of the Famine rebellion is a fascinating if forgotten history.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The history of the Great Hunger is rooted in stories of greed, racism and senseless suffering. This episode however sheds light on some of the amazing stories of compassion and solidarity that saved thousands of lives.
While it can be difficult not to focus on the disastrous actions of the British Government, it is also important to remember the forgotten heroes of the Great Famine – the Victorian equivalent of aid workers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Many histories of the Great Hunger refer to the famine ending in 1847. It is true that the famine did start to ease in some parts of the island in the following years.
However in the west the catastrophe was far from over - some of the darkest chapters lay ahead as 1847 drew to a close.
This episode focuses in on one area – Clifden in Co Galway where the famine in 1848 was arguably even worse than it had been during Black ’47.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Mulranny Police Conspiracy is a little-known story that took place in the west of Ireland at the turn of the 20th century. The setting is Mulranny – a stunning village along the Wild Atlantic Way but in 1900 it was something of a forgotten backwater. However it was here, on the shores of Clew Bay that this story of deceit unfolded. In what is at times a bizarre and tragic plot, the Royal Irish Constabulary turned on this poor community in Co Mayo when they began to campaign for better rights.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Iniskea Islands are among the most remote places in Ireland. Although deserted today, throughout the 19th century the lives of the islanders were the source of bizarre rumours. Numerous outsiders accused the islanders of piracy &amp;amp; worshipping pagan gods into the 1870s.
In this podcast I look at whether these Islanders were truly the last pagans and pirates in Ireland. The answers are suprising to say the least.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the 1830s the British politican George Lewis described the fate of an informer in ireland as a man &#34;doomed to certain death....he would be hunted through the country like a mad dog every hand would be raised against him&#34;.&amp;nbsp;
This was something of an understatement in some cases.&amp;nbsp;
In 1816 Edward Lynch became an informer. A few months later this resulted in one of the worst crimes in pre-famine Ireland - The Massacre of Wildgoose Lodge.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Did the experiences of the Famine drive Irish people insane?
In this episode I look at the story of the famine survivor John Thompson who ended up in the Rainhill asylum in Lancashire in the 1860s. In this Victorian institution (which treated mental illnesses) he would find himself surrounded by other Irish people.
This podcast looks at why Irish peope found themsleves in British asylums in disproportionate numbers in the 1850s and 1860s.</description>

However the Famine is inextricably linked to the story of the American Civil War (1861-1865). Around 200,000 Irish people, most of them famine or post famine emigrants, fought in the conflict making it one of the largest wars in terms of Irish participation.

Millions of Irish people emigrated to the United States during and after the Great Famine. This is their story. Through this podcast you will follow them on voyages across the Atlantic before looking at several Irish communities from the Five Points Slum in New York to the Rocky Mountains. From persecuted Irish miners in the Pennsylvanian Coalfields to deeply racist Irish prospectors in the Californian Goldrush the Irish story in America is fascinating and complex.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Coffin Ships are one of the most enduring images from the Great Famine. This was the name given to the boats that carried Irish Famine emigrants to North America in 1847.&amp;nbsp;This sinister title comes from the appalling death rates onboard these ships. This show opens with the hopes and fears of famine emigrants in Black &#39;47. Then I move on to the harrowing voyages and what awaited the emirgants when they landed in Canada, This fell far short of their expectations - this journey will take us onto the dreaded quarantine station of Gross Isle in the St Laurence river.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Emigration is arguably the greatest legacy of the Great Irish Famine. Between 1846 and 1851, 1.25 million Irish people passed through the port of Liverpool alone to escape the Great Hunger. This exodus of refugees transformed the Great Famine from an Irish catastrophe into a global phenomenon as these people established Irish communities across the world. It fitting then that the show opens with a story from the Canadian city of Montreal in the 1870s.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over the course of the Great Famine, hundreds of thousands of Irish people were evicted from their homes.
As ruthless landlords showed no pity, eviction was a death sentence for many starving tenants who were made homeless.
It was inevitable these evictions provoked resistance. On November 2nd 1847, the most famous assassination of the Great Famine took place in North Roscommon.
This podcast details the background of this assassination and how it relates to the wider story of other mass evictions in Ireland in the late 1840s.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The crumbling ruins of workhouses are one of the last visible reminders of the horrors of the Great Hunger in the Irish landscape. During the Great Famine they became home to the unwanted in Irish society. Ultimately over 300,000 people Irish people died in these institutions during the Great Hunger.&amp;nbsp;
While they may have been unwanted by the late 1840s very few of the so called &#39;inmates&#39; of workhouses were born unwanted.</description>

After two years of starvation, the only election held during the Great Famine took place in August 1847. In some constituencies this poll was more like a blood sport than modern elections.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Transportation was a particularity cruel punishment. For centuries those condemned to this fate were shipped to penal colonies on the far side of the globe to serve out their sentences. It has become synonymous with injustice during the famine when many caught stealing food suffered this fate. For this podcast I dug deep into the archives and found the story of the Nangle family whose lives were ripped apart after they were caught stealing sheep.</description>

While death rates in the capital were not as severe as the west of Ireland, the city suffered nevertheless. The show follows the story of the Mulherins, a family who fled famine in their home in Co Leitrim and settled in the Smithfield - Stoneybatter area of Dublin. They quickly found life in the capital city was very different but not necessarily easier.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From January 1847 Irish people desperately trying to flee the famine began to leave the island in huge numbers.&amp;nbsp;
220,000 left in that year alone and by 1853 more than one in six people who had lived in Ireland in 1845 had emigrated. While we know a lot about where they went and the horrendous conditions they faced, we know less about the lives they left behind. This show tells that story through the words of these Irish emigrants.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As the situation deteriorated in Ireland in late 1846, the two Cork towns of Youghal and Skibbereen experienced the unfolding horrors in very different ways. The people of Youghal, due to local dynamics, were in a position to rise up against some of the causes of famine. Through the Autumn of 1846 they launched an insurrection in a desperate bid to stop food being exported. However at Skibbereen&amp;nbsp;in west Cork the people found themselves in a far worse situation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Many travellers who visited the west of Ireland in the 19th century considered it as a frontier of sorts. They were more often than not deeply racist, yet we still rely heavily on their accounts to reconstruct a picture of life at the time. In this show I question&amp;nbsp;how reliable their accounts are. In an effort to create a more vivid picture of life in the 1840s I have interviewed with two archaeologists - Franc Myles and Eve Campbell for this show.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Through the summer of 1846 Ireland had endured terrible hunger and suffering. However against the odds the numbers who had starved to death were few. As many waited in great anticipation for the coming harvest, disaster struck when the potato blight returned on a much wider scale than in 1845. As the Irish MP Daniel O&#39;Connell stated a &#39;death dealing famine&#39; was on the cards. This show begins with a story of emigration and passengers on an early coffin ship.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The summer of 1846 was a tense time in Ireland. As food grew scarce lawlessness, riots and violence became frequent. Everyone eagerly awaited May 15th when the British Government would open it&#39;s emergency food depots. Perhaps then the tensions and anxiety at the heart of Irish society would ease? However would the food in these emergency depots be enough to stave off famine until the harvest was ready in Autumn?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As the harvest of 1845 approached in Ireland, rumours circulated that&amp;nbsp;a mysterious disease was attacking the potato crop. While well informed botanists in London grew increasingly anxious about what lay ahead, many Irish peasants dependent on potatoes had little idea what was happening. When the harvest did fail, the Great Famine had begun. Terror gripped the population and I look at what the British authorities did to respond.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description 1845 is famous for one thing in Irish history – the beginning of the Great Famine. However contrary to what you might expect, if you lived in Ireland through most of 1845 there was little evidence to suggest Irish society stood on the brink of one of the greatest famines in history. This episode looks at the highs and lows of life in Ireland as the Famine approached.</description>

Married three times she also had a string of famous lovers including a king, the composer Franz Liszt and the author Alexander Dumas. Were she alive today her friends would include the most powerful people alive, she would be plagued by the paparazzi, have millions of twitter followers and if she had a website it would be most definitely x rated.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1845 the population of Ireland was heading towards 9 million with many people surviving on a diet of potatoes. This has lead many to claim that the island was overpopulated. In this podcast I head to a remote village of Inver in Erris to see how the population has changed over the past 150 years. I also investigate exactly how many people lived in Ireland, what was the standard of living and whether the people were healthy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This podcast, the first in my new series on the Great Famine, gives a background to Ireland in the 19th century. Entitled &#39;Rebel Island&#39; it focuses on the life of one extraordinary Irish rebel -&amp;nbsp;Anne Devlin. She lived a remarkable life and was involved in the 1798 and 1803 rebellions. These reshaped Ireland and had profound consequences impacting life right up to and during the Great Famine.
Anne Devlin&#39;s life also explains why sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants dominated life in Ireland, what the Act of Union was and why it was so important.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the opening line of his novel The Go Between the writer L.P. Hartley famously quipped ‘The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there’. For me history is about attempting to visit this foreign country L.P. Hartley talked about and seeing what life was like. In this podcast I have&amp;nbsp;trawled through eye witness accounts of travelers to early 19th century Ireland to give you a sense of what life was like in a past where they did things very differently.</description>

She would never return to the town she grew up in, save for the very occasional visit.&amp;nbsp;
However for over 40 years she wrote to her brother Jack Dwyer (my grandfather) in Castlecomer revealing intriguing insights into her unusual life as a nun in rural Dakota.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Part I of this series on the Maamtrasna murders I looked at one of the most brutal killings in 19th century Ireland when the Joyce family were attacked in their remote home in Maamtrasna on the Mayo-Galway border.
This podcast follows looks at the trials. While the police made a major break through within days of the murder a botched attempt at swift justice would see the story of the trials become nearly as famous the murders themselves.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Prior to 1882, Maamtrasna a remote townland in the west of Ireland, was known to few outside Co. Galway. That all changed on the night of August 17th 1882 when one of the most brutal murders in 19th century Ireland took place there.
Five members of the Joyce family were killed in a horrific and disturbing attack. In a deeply unnerving aspect of a case still shrouded in mystery, the perpetrators were almost certainly known to the victims.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Medieval outlaws have captured the human imagination for centuries. The story of Robin Hood who famously robbed from the rich to give to the poor has proved the most enduring. However most were ruthless individuals, many were willing to rob from the rich but few ever gave their bounty to the poor.
This podcast is about a Irish man who was an outlaw in all but name. While Jack would avoid being declared an outlaw his life gives a much better sense of what a medieval outlaw was like rather than the oft recounted tales of Robin Hood.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This podcast was funded by the Mary Raftery Journalism Fund.
We don’t remember 1980s fondly in Ireland. Emigration and recession were features of life. The political atmosphere was defined by divisive and bitter debates around abortion in 1983 and divorce in 1986.
There was also a third deeply discomforting debate that rocked Irish society. Almost completely forgotten, this debate around child sexual abuse lifted the lid on a topic previously shrouded by shame, taboo and a code of silence.</description>

This podcast uses the never before published words of Florence Doreen Wandesforde who wrote a short account of her childhood in Castlecomer House before she died in 1999 at the age 95.
This is a fascinating insight to the world of upstairs-downstairs. Doreen and her family had their own butler, cook, servants and even gym instructor.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Irish Free State remained neutral in World War II. Nevertheless the country and its people still faced attack. In 1941 the Nazis bombed the North Strand in Dublin. However the most lethal explosion took place in a remote corner of Donegal killing 19 people. An eyewitness recalled a &#34;tremendous explosion shook the heavens and a brilliant blinding flash of light illuminated the countryside lighting up mountains many miles to the rear&#34;</description>

While he ultimately helped save 150 people from the holocaust, he was not celebrated in Ireland. Instead after he revealed how the church was involved in supporting the Nazi allies in Yugoslavia he suffered what was in effect internal exile.

This episode looks at the Ireland&#39;s hidden hand in history - Irish people who you have never heard of but nevertheless played key roles in history.

Others include Eliza Lynch a cork woman who became the first lady of Paraguay in the 19th century and Joseph Kavanagh a leading figure in the French Revolution.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the aftermath of the famine the people of Castlecomer were shell-shocked, reeling from years of death, disease and emigration. However by the 1880s this had changed. When yet another famine threatened in 1879, and landlords threatened eviction, tenants across Ireland rose up in rebellion. The miners of Castlecomer, not to be left behind, launched the Great Coal Strike of 1881. Hear this fascinating story here in this latest episode of Secret Societies, Communism and Coal – Life in the Castlecomer Colliery.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1845 life in the Castlecomer Coalfields was racked by economic recession and grinding poverty. When the potato crop, the staple diet of millions across Ireland, failed disaster struck. In the following years around one million Irish people died and over one million emigrated.
In Castlecomer the fate of thousands lay in the hands on one man - Charles Wandesforde - the mine owner and local landlord. His decisions were controversial but it not easy to decide whether they were good bad.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For three centuries the town of Castlecomer in North Co. Kilkenny staged one of the most fascinating but forgotten struggles in Irish history. Miners who worked in some of the most harsh working conditions constantly struggled against the mine owner. Given it was often a matter of life and death this struggle was often bitter and conflict was never far from the surface. This saw the miners form secret societies, trade unions, republican and indeed even communist organisations.</description>

Then the show delves into the harsh world of mining in the 19th century before turning to some thoughts on the Great Famine.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description By 1190 the Normans were utterly dominant throughout much of Ireland. As undisputed masters they set about tranforming their lands into societies modelled on their homelands in Wales and England. Gaelic Society was destroyed. This podcast looks at what exactly this change was like, what happened and what it was like to live in the Norman Colony. In order to gain a clear insight the show focuses on the Gaelic Kingdom of Ossory and how it became the Norman County of Kilkenny.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Kingdom of Connacht in the west of Ireland represented one of the greatest obstacles to Norman domination of Ireland. The ruling family, the O&#39;Connors had resisted Norman intrusion into their kingdom on several occasions. However in the 1190s their power began to fade.&amp;nbsp;As three members of the family&amp;nbsp;- Cathal &#39;of the Red Hand&#39; O&#39;Connor, his brother and grandnephew battled for the crown, the Normans were quick to intervene.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Part XX sees us enter the 1190s and the Norman Invasion enters what might be called end game. In this decade they begin to advance in to the far west of the island. The Gaelic Irish response is at times baffling. Old internal feuds only intensify as the ruling families cannot let go of past transgressions and unify against the Normans. This leads to a disasterous otcome. This episode looks at events in Munster while coming shows will look at Connacht and Ulster.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Bad, possibly mad and very dangerous, Prince John was one of the most notorious men of the Middle Ages. While his cruel reputation is preserved in the Robin Hood myths his real life notoriety began in Ireland in 1185. If the Island did not have enough problems in the aftermath of the Norman Invasion, the arrival of this prince threatened not only the Gaelic Irish kings but the existing Norman Colonists aswell.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A few weeks ago I hit the road with a recorder taking in some of the best medieval sites in Ireland. The show takes in 1000 years of Irish history in one day-trip. Starting in around the year 600 in the monastery Glendalough at sunrise before driving through the Wicklow mountains to Kilkenny, I visited many places mentioned in the podcast. The trip finished off in the 16th century in a spot off the beaten track, but a real forgotten gem.</description>

Forged amidst a civil war in England some people even claim it is the cornerstone of modern democracy. This podcast looks at the brutal reign of King John which led to Magna Carta being written, before looking at its impact in Ireland. The show concludes with why I think its over rated and perhaps why medieval riots are as important.</description>

These were the revolutionaries, feminists, socialists, and trade union organisers in the early 20th century . Often dubbed as unamerican they strenuously rejected this notion. They saw themselves as much Americans or Irish American as much as anyone else, they just held a very different view of what America should be. Hear their fascinating story in the show.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This show sees the arrival of the man who is probably the most important figure in our story after Strongbow. Hugh de Lacy, the Lord of Meath ruled over 800,000 acres of land north of Dublin. When he arrived however it was ruined by years of war. During his first four years as the kings representative in Ireland he transformed these territories, but it came at a cost. Nevertheless by the time he was finished many would struggle to recognise what had once been the Southern O&#39;Neill kingdom of Meath.</description>

In this show we see a fresh Norman army land in Waterford bent on conquering Munster. They are however stepping into a minefield of bloody feuds that stretch back centuries. In this episode I take a different approach, focusing on experience of the Gaelic Irish rather than the Normans.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The last show on the Norman Invasion ended in somewhat dramatic circumstances with the death of Strongbow, the leader of the Norman Invasion. As you can imagine the fall out from this was immense.
The episode begins with a group of Normans lead by Raymond le Gros who hear the news when they are deep in Gaelic territory. No one knows how the kings of Gaelic Ireland will react when they hear the news.</description>

The Manchester Guardian reported 750,000 people were at risk, a figure repeated by the Soviet Union&#39;s daily Pravda.

        <description>Podcast Description The story of protest in medieval Ireland is a forgotten but fascinating chapter in our history. While forthright and often violent these protests voiced the concerns of ordinary people so often excluded from written records. In this podcast I look at five protests from late medieval Ireland including a water tax in 1244 and Ireland&#39;s first recorded strike in 1299. The intriguing stories behind these protests are brought to light for the first time in centuries in this podcast.</description>

Henry had come in the hope to proclaiming himself lord over the entire island. Awaiting him were not just his own Norman subjects who had been fighting in Ireland since 1169 but also dozens of Gaelic kings. How these kings in particular would react to Henry&#39;s claims would be crucial. The King however had prepared for all eventualities bringing an army of over 4,000 warriors and even prefabricated siege towers.</description>

After the arrival of several hundred Norman mercenaries in 1169 the fortunes of Diarmait McMurrough had changed. He had reconquered his lost power in the kingdom of Leinster and re-established himself as a major player in Irish politics.
However this was only the beginning, a violent prelude to Diarmait’s main ambition. He was still waiting for the main force of his mercenaries lead by the Norman Lord Strongbow to arrive and when they did they in the summer of 1170 they did not fail to make their mark.</description>

These Scandinavians have been caricatured throughout the centuries as marauding maniacs a somewhat undeserved reputation. However in this episode they don’t exactly cover themselves in glory.
The show will reveal what drove people in Scandinavia to launch what were terrifying raids, how these raiders reached Ireland and then before the episode ends we will join them for their onslaught on Irish monasteries.</description>
