        <description>Podcast Description It’s not just Rishi Sunak’s approval rating which has taken a battering. Keir Starmer has his own popularity problem. Why?

Ukraine’s President Zelensky has embarked on a world tour, pleading for more money for the Ukraine war. Is it time to rethink their strategy?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Autumn Statement hasn’t delivered the stability and calm that Sunak and Hunt likely hoped for.

In a week where Sunak hoped his Global Investment Summit would grab the headlines, why are the Tories failing to land their message?
Meanwhile, it&#39;s reported Sunak rebuffed Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s proposals to allow talks between the opposition and the Civil Service to begin.</description>

What does it reveal about the toxic culture operating in Westminster at that time? And why this isn&#39;t ancient history for the Tories.
Trouble is still brewing for Keir Starmer over his party&#39;s response to the Israel-Gaza conflict. Is his political authority in danger?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The violence between Israel and Gaza rages on. What are Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer thinking behind the scenes in Westminster? And what does the conflict mean for the global economy?

Meanwhile, Labour are preparing to take to the stage for their own conference in Liverpool, with Rachel Reeves&#39; hotly anticipated speech on Monday.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4523030016/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description As Jeremy Hunt scrambles for&amp;nbsp;pre-election tax cuts, the northern leg of HS2 is under threat and&amp;nbsp;pensioners are facing a smaller raise in&amp;nbsp;payments than they were expecting. Is the Chancellor making mistakes that will cost his&amp;nbsp;party an important support base? And pressure is mounting on Rishi Sunak over allegations of a Chinese spy in&amp;nbsp;parliament, but that&#39;s far from his only problem - with oil prices soaring, how can the Prime Minister make sure he keeps his inflation pledge?</description>
