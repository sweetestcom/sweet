        <description>Podcast Description You might have seen him on Instagram or his RT√â TV shows divvying out money advice - Eoin McGee is the financial planner who has been on a mission to teach Irish people How to Be Good With Money and it was great fun to have him as my guest on today&#39;s show! He chatted to me about surviving the life-threatening fall that left him with a brain bleed, how he and his brothers honoured his Dad‚Äôs memory with a special glass of whiskey, and the first memory of laughter that involved him pissing on his friend‚Äôs head!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From his appearances on the Sunday Game before his recent retirement, Pat Spillane became a voice and face of Irish life as familiar as Bosco or Anne Doyle! But he&#39;s much more than the crank on the couch as I came to find out. He talked to me about growing up with a pub as a playground, the mountain he had to climb to woo his wife Rosarii, and how he has managed to live his entire life without having to cook, clean, or change a nappy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From pop stardom, to food blogger, to celebrity chef and food author, Donal Skehan has had a *very* interesting career arc.

We also chatted about the Barbie doll that came between him and his brother John, a recent dark time in his life, and getting his own back on Dustin the Turkey, amongst many other things.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Not for the first time on The Laughs of Your Life, I come face to face with a politician who I do an impression of! Mary Lou McDonald wasted no time in bringing that up, but she&#39;s a good sport, as well as being a fascinating guest, who I&#39;ve been very keen to have on the podcast for a while. She talked to me about the failed hair glow-up that left her looking like Bosco, her unusual approach to stress relief, and where she thinks her political career could go.</description>

India Sasha&#39;s bio describes her as the ‚ÄòCEO of One Hand Humour‚Äô and she is without question one of the brightest and bubbliest stars of Irish TikTok right now. We chatted about growing up in Belfast and how that means seeing riots as ‚Äònormal‚Äô and a chance to get off school early, her family‚Äôs unique sense of humour which helped her to deal with being born with one hand, and of course, *that* superviral Rock/Paper/Scissors video.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Presenter, rugby player and Love Island winner, Greg O&#39;Shea is my guest on today&#39;s show.
Trigger warning: I am so grateful to Greg for his honesty in our chat. I truly believe what he has to say about asking for help when he encountered his own mental health struggles will be massively helpful to many people, particularly men, but it is important to note this conversation involves discussion about suicidal feelings.</description>
