Four years and eight seasons later, I think it’s safe to say that A LOT has changed for Virgin Radio UK’s brand new presenter. Which is why I asked him to come back as my Season 9 finale guest. He talked to me about running out of juice as the host of the Late Late show, his taxi ride to the Oireachtas Hearing, and the joys of being a ghost in London.</description></item><item><title>Eoin McGee | The Laughs Of Your Life with Doireann Garrihy</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9608790001/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:01:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9608790001/</guid><description>Podcast Description You might have seen him on Instagram or his RTÉ TV shows divvying out money advice - Eoin McGee is the financial planner who has been on a mission to teach Irish people How to Be Good With Money and it was great fun to have him as my guest on today's show!

But he's much more than the crank on the couch as I came to find out. He talked to me about growing up with a pub as a playground, the mountain he had to climb to woo his wife Rosarii, and how he has managed to live his entire life without having to cook, clean, or change a nappy.</description></item><item><title>Donal Skehan | The Laughs Of Your Life with Doireann Garrihy</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9608790003/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 00:01:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9608790003/</guid><description>Podcast Description From pop stardom, to food blogger, to celebrity chef and food author, Donal Skehan has had a *very* interesting career arc.

Mary Lou McDonald wasted no time in bringing that up, but she's a good sport, as well as being a fascinating guest, who I've been very keen to have on the podcast for a while. She talked to me about the failed hair glow-up that left her looking like Bosco, her unusual approach to stress relief, and where she thinks her political career could go.</description></item><item><title>Arthur Gourounlian | The Laughs Of Your Life with Doireann Garrihy</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9608790005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 00:01:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9608790005/</guid><description>Podcast Description Having had the pleasure of&amp;nbsp;working alongside him on Dancing With The Stars, I knew Arthur Gourounlian had an incredible life story to tell.

Aisling has been on my dream guest list since the get go! Chatting to her was like chatting to an old school pal. We covered…growing up in Kildare, the period/boob train (it’ll all make sense 🚂) and refusing to learn the “men speak before women” rule in comedy. This season of The Laughs Of Your Life podcast is brought to you by F&amp;amp;F Clothing available at Tesco.</description></item><item><title>Robert Sheehan | The Laughs Of Your Life with Doireann Garrihy</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9608790036/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 04:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9608790036/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Laughs of your Life is a podcast with Doireann Garrihy at the helm.
