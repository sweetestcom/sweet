From black holes to the expanding universe, every observation of the universe, so far, has been held up by the maths in Einstein's extraordinary work. So how was he able to predict the events and behaviour of our universe, long before the technology existed to prove he was right, and will there ever be another theory that will supersede it?</description></item><item><title>Episode 1 | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700123/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700123/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's 100 years since the publication of Einstein's great theory, and arguably one of the greatest scientific theories of all time.

Brian Cox and Robin Ince are joined on stage by plant biologist Professor Jane Langdale, physicist Professor Jim Al-Khalili and comedian and former horticulture student Ed Byrne to ask, "what's the point of plants?". How would the evolution of life on our planet have differed without plants, and what would our planet look like today? Most crucially that seemingly dull but necessary process of photosynthesis that we all learned about in school, is in fact one of the most important processes in our universe, and as usual it seems, the physicists are trying to take credit for it.</description></item><item><title>When Quantum Goes Woo | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700132/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700132/</guid><description>Podcast Description When Quantum Goes Woo

Viewed by many as deeply suspicious, even heretical, creation of life is one of the key ideas that generates distrust in science, but is this fair and are we really entering a brave new world where life is no longer in nature's hands.</description></item><item><title>Brain Science | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700158/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700158/</guid><description>Podcast Description Will science ever understand the human mind? Brian Cox and Robin Ince are joined on stage by comedian and former psychiatric nurse, Jo Brand, and neuroscientists Sophie Scott and Brian Butterworth. With ever more sensitive brain scanning techniques and advances in brain science, how close are we to understanding the inner workings of the human mind - or is this a quest that still remains in the hands of the philosophers?</description></item><item><title>Secret Science | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700159/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700159/</guid><description>Podcast Description Robin Ince and Brian Cox are joined on stage by comedian Dave Gorman, author and Enigma Machine owner Simon Singh and Bletchley Park enthusiast Dr Sue Black as they discuss secret science, code-breaking and the extraordinary achievements of the team working at Bletchley during WWII.

For example, the British physicist who calculated the optimal way to dunk a biscuit into a cup of tea without it disintegrating too quickly. Or the brain researchers who demonstrated that they could detect meaningful brain activity... in a dead salmon. All these academics share something in common, not just a slightly quirky application of the scientific method.</description></item><item><title>Space Exploration | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700161/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2012 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700161/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Infinite Monkeys are back and in the first of the new series Brian Cox and Robin Ince boldly go where no science programme has been before, as they discuss space exploration with Captain Jean Luc Picard himself, actor Sir Patrick Stewart; former quantum physicist Ben Miller; and Professor of Planetary Sciences, Monica Grady. They'll be discussing whether space really is the final frontier and whether, with the development of ever more sophisticated robotic space missions, do humans need to go to space at all?</description></item><item><title>Science v Art | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700162/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700162/</guid><description>Podcast Description Brian Cox and Robin Ince transport the cage of infinite proportions, to the slightly more confined space of the Latitude Comedy Arena. They will be joined on stage by a panel of guests, including Al Murray, for a witty, irreverent and unashamedly rational look at the world according to science. Given Latitude's artistic, musical and literary credentials, they'll be taking a huge risk by staging the ultimate show down, as they pitch Art against Science and ask which has more to offer and whether the two cultures might ever make a happy union.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Universes | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700163/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2012 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700163/</guid><description>Podcast Description Brian Cox and Robin Ince stretch the cage of infinite proportions this week to encompass not just our own universe, but any others that might be lurking out there as well. They'll be joined by QI creator John Lloyd, the Astronomer Royal, Professor Sir Martin Rees, and solar scientist Dr Lucie Green to talk about one of the most tantalising ideas of cosmology, that of parallel universes. Are we inhabiting a universe that is just one of a possibly infinite number of others and how would we ever know?</description></item><item><title>The Science of Symmetry | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700164/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2012 09:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700164/</guid><description>Podcast Description Brian Cox and Robin Ince are joined by mathematician Marcus Du Sautoy, science journalist Adam Rutherford and comic book legend Alan Moore to discuss why symmetry seems such a pervasive phenomenon throughout our universe, and possibly beyond. The world turns on symmetry -- from the spin of subatomic particles to the structure of the natural world, through to the molecules that make up life itself. They'll be asking why symmetry seems so ubiquitous and whether the key to Brian's large female fanbase is down to his more than usually symmetrical face.</description></item><item><title>Does Size Matter? | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700165/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700165/</guid><description>Podcast Description Robin Ince and Brian Cox are joined on stage by comedian Andy Hamilton to discuss whether size matters? Material scientist Mark Miodownik and bioengineer Eleanor Stride also join the panel to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being really huge, or extremely small, and why if you wanted to be a truly effective super hero, then being really really tiny is probably the greatest superpower you could have.

They are joined by comedian Marcus Brigstocke, medic and broadcaster Dr Kevin Fong, evolutionary biologist Aoife McLysaght and Nobel Laureate Professor Barry Marshall. Marshall, an Australian physician, famously experimented on himself to prove his theory that a bacterium was responsible for most peptic ulcers. He drank the bacterium he suspected was the cause, and as a result reversed decades of medical doctrine.</description></item><item><title>Oceans: The Last Great Unexplored Frontier? | The Infinite Monkey Cage</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/7382700167/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2012 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/7382700167/</guid><description>Podcast Description Brian Cox and Robin Ince return for a new series of the award-winning science/comedy show, as they take a witty, irreverent and unashamedly rational look at the world according to science.
