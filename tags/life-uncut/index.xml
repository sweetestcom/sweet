Welcome to therapy where we unpack all of your dilemmas!
First up today, kids with second child syndrome and main character kids that potentially need some resilience.
Christmas hams are the ultimate raffle prize and they will now be coming home with Laura more often. We unpack the top google searches in Aus for the year. Some were to be expected and were a bit of a surprise.</description>

Today&#39;s episode is part 2 of diving into narcissism. You can listen to part 1 on narcissists in romantic relationships here!
Now we are taking a deep dive on having a narcissistic parent and how to navigate co-parenting with a narcissist.
Firstly we are joined by Monique. Monique and her siblings grew up with a mum who was the most noticeable person in the room. She was generous, she was incredibly beautiful and she was also a narcissist.</description>

Today is a bit of a silly, fun episode because we&#39;re all crawling to the finish line, right??
Laura&#39;s been in some child induced hell for the last few days and Britt has learnt that kids can be assholes. Weird that it took this long to get here!
Britt has a new theory of girl language; the things we say vs what we actually mean. PS Ben, always get a gift.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hey Lifers,
Welcome back to therapy where we unpack your deep, dark and burning questions!
Last night we went on a fancy shmancy boat and Laura accidentally got a little handsy with... not Matt.
We speak about the latest trailer that netflix dropped of Ricky Gervais&#39; upcoming comedy special that contains a &#39;joke&#39; about terminally ill children. It raised a lot of questions like:
-Comedy often relies on pushing boundaries, but where should the line be drawn when it comes to making jokes about vulnerable or marginalised groups?</description>

Today was chaotic (more than normal)! The studio flooded from the crazy rain over the weekend. Laura&#39;s got some more pigeon facts for us, and guys, you&#39;re WELCOME!
Laura is also hyper fixated on home renos, flat pack assembly and gardening. We have a bit of a back and forth of how we feel about the new season of the Bachelors; where it&#39;s hitting and where it&#39;s missing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Welcome to therapy Thursday where we unpack your life dilemmas!
First up, Laura&#39;s obsessed with the original &#39;quiet quitters&#39; and they&#39;re pigeons.
You can see why here.
There&#39;s a bit of a conspiracy theory going on tiktok where people are claiming that they&#39;ve been conned by restaurant owners! They are saying that they have been chatting to people on dating apps, and teeing up a date at a restaurant only to be stood up at the restaurant.</description>

Welcome back to therapy where we all share our shit and feel better about ourselves!
First up today, well... it&#39;s chaos.
Bills need to be paid and they&#39;re multiplying! But we also need to learn to distinguish the difference between a legitimate bill and a scam. *Brittany Hockley we are looking at you.
We&#39;re all up to date with our skin checks, but Laura&#39;s got a bee in her bonnet about specialists waiting rooms.</description>

Britt had a big surprise this week and Laura had a wonderful family holiday; except for one part where she said something to a stranger that has made us want the ground to swallow us up!
We unpack the redemption story that the Kardashians are trying to pull off with one of the world&#39;s most notorious cheaters Tristan Thompson.
It raised the questions if your sister&#39;s or friend&#39;s partner cheated on them, and they forgave them, do you have to as well?</description>

Welcome back to your ask uncut therapy session! Today is a biggie because Laura is back and covid free.
Britt&#39;s been hogtied and mortified from the little ratbag that is Delilah. Laura&#39;s luggage is finally back in her hands so the life updates are full of highs and lols today.
We break down possibly the pettiest court case to exist in the celebrity space between Robert De Niro and his ex assistant Chase Robinson.</description>

Laura, Producer Keeshia and Mitch have all fallen like dominos from covid and somehow Britt&#39;s immune system is still going strong. There&#39;s a neuroscientist who has claimed that there are chemical reasons that women fall in love with men when they are having sex; whereas it&#39;s not quite the same for men.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Joining the podcast today is sex coach, author and presenter Tara O!
Tara was living what seemed to be her best Carrie Bradshaw life. She was writing a column and having a lot of &#39;wild&#39; sexual experiences. But she wasn&#39;t having good sex.
Like SO many of us, it was a performance (has the peacock entered the chat?).
We speak about:
&#39;Performing&#39; during sexWhy we all need to stop faking orgasms with one night stands or long term loversLearning what actually turns us on and gets us offHow to communicate with a partner about what you like and don&#39;t likeYou can find all of Tara&#39;s stuff like her workshops, coaching, book etc here!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hey Lifers, Today we jump in by discussing whether it&#39;s justified to be annoyed when people post about their wealth.
Is it super cringey or should we check our hesitation towards it?
Laura also got her wedding video back from the editors and it had a beautiful song all about falling in love...It just so happened to have lyrics about falling in love with a woman by the name of Matt&#39;s ex!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hey Lifers,
Welcome to your weekly unpacking of dilemmas.
Today we kick things off by unpacking whether the whole &#39;speaking your truth&#39; and being brutally honest can actually be cruel. &#34;No offence but&#34; doesn&#39;t always translate. Vibe or unsubscribe this week:
Laura - Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery on Netflix
Britt - Hands free dog leash https://notyourregularpet.com/collections/handsfree
Then we jump into your questions!
I’ve just found out I’m pregnant and I am trying to decide on baby names.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Get the kleenexes ready because it’s the finale and the very last episode of Bach Uncut for 2023!
Three strapping young men who have spent the last few weeks working their way through a truckload of women (mainly Felix) are left with Lauren, Leah, Abigail, Jess, Alésia and Angela - $50 to anyone who can put a face to each of their names.
We don’t want to give away the result but there’s two proposals (only one is successful) the beloved Damien decides to make a return for one last visit - we hope he’s being paid by Channel 10 for this.</description>
