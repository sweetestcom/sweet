Welcome to therapy where we unpack all of your dilemmas!
First up today, kids with second child syndrome and main character kids that potentially need some resilience.
Christmas hams are the ultimate raffle prize and they will now be coming home with Laura more often. We unpack the top google searches in Aus for the year. Some were to be expected and were a bit of a surprise.</description></item><item><title>My mum is a narcissist - Talking Narcissism part 2 | Life Uncut</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9634970002/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9634970002/</guid><description>Podcast Description Hey Lifers!
Today's episode is part 2 of diving into narcissism. You can listen to part 1 on narcissists in romantic relationships here!
Now we are taking a deep dive on having a narcissistic parent and how to navigate co-parenting with a narcissist.
Firstly we are joined by Monique. Monique and her siblings grew up with a mum who was the most noticeable person in the room.

Today is a bit of a silly, fun episode because we're all crawling to the finish line, right??
Laura's been in some child induced hell for the last few days and Britt has learnt that kids can be assholes. Weird that it took this long to get here!
Britt has a new theory of girl language; the things we say vs what we actually mean. PS Ben, always get a gift.</description></item><item><title>Are we compatible?

Welcome back to therapy where we unpack your deep, dark and burning questions!
Last night we went on a fancy shmancy boat and Laura accidentally got a little handsy with... not Matt.
We speak about the latest trailer that netflix dropped of Ricky Gervais' upcoming comedy special that contains a 'joke' about terminally ill children. It raised a lot of questions like:
-Comedy often relies on pushing boundaries, but where should the line be drawn when it comes to making jokes about vulnerable or marginalised groups?</description></item><item><title>Why My Parents Tried to Kill Me.

First up, Laura's obsessed with the original 'quiet quitters' and they're pigeons.
You can see why here.

Welcome back to your ask uncut therapy session! Today is a biggie because Laura is back and covid free.
Britt's been hogtied and mortified from the little ratbag that is Delilah. Laura's luggage is finally back in her hands so the life updates are full of highs and lols today.

Laura, Producer Keeshia and Mitch have all fallen like dominos from covid and somehow Britt's immune system is still going strong. There's a neuroscientist who has claimed that there are chemical reasons that women fall in love with men when they are having sex; whereas it's not quite the same for men.</description></item><item><title>Lola strikes a pose - The best of The PickUp | Life Uncut</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9634970024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:41:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9634970024/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's our weekly round up!

Today is an episode really close to Laura's heart. It's an episode she has wanted to do for a long time. Initially we thought this was going to be a chat about dementia, but it ended up being so much more than just a focus on dementia. This episode is important for anyone who has a loved one that will hopefully be lucky enough to grow old.</description></item><item><title>Bush poos, lasting love and age gaps - The best of The Pickup | Life Uncut</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/9634970036/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 21:36:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/9634970036/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's our weekly round up!
