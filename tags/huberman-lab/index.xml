When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness &amp; Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8351320072/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320072/</guid><description>Podcast Description My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
