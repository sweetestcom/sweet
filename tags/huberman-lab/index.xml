        <description>Podcast Description This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. For the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320166/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn&amp;rsquo;t just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320167/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite&amp;ndash;and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact).</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320168/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, I discuss testosterone and estrogen hormones and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: &amp;ldquo;what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?&amp;rdquo;; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320170/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/8351320171/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description This episode explains the science of motivation and drive. I describe how dopamine&amp;ndash; a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.</description>
