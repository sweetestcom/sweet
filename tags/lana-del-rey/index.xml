Saw flecks of what could′ve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did

I′m unglued - thanks to you
And it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin&amp;rsquo; beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful</description></item></channel></rss>
