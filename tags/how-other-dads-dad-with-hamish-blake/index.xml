        <description>Podcast Description Rob Sitch is not only a prolific creator of some of Australia&#39;s most beloved comedy characters, TV shows and films, he is also one of the very first friends that Hamish got to see dadding up close. Many years ago, backstage on Thank God You Are Here, and well before his own dadding journey started, Hamish started talking to Rob about his philosophies on being a parent, and so it is only fitting that Rob is on the first episode of How Other Dads Dad.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hamish has been working on a little passion project, and it’s all about dadding. Keenly aware that his own dadding playbook was made up from the tips, tricks and hacks he had nabbed from friends and colleagues - Hamish decided it might be time to formalise his acquisition of wisdom, so that it might be shared (and helpfully add to the 1 billion podcasts now in existence). In each episode he’ll have a chat with a dad that he admires (and who he was able to easily text) and discuss how they go about dadding; the tips, the tricks, the pitfalls and the moments of pure joy.</description>
