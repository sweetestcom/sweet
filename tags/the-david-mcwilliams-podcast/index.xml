This podcast is celebration of spending. Ireland&amp;rsquo;s tax base is set up to generate surplus, so spend the money. Join the gang! https://plus.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description How is the Israeli tail is wagging the American dog? America&amp;rsquo;s election is exactly one year from now and Joe Biden is in bed with Netanyahu, but his own party, the Democratic Party is deeply divided by his embrace of Israel.

This emasculation, combined with the end of the 0% interest rate days where previous &amp;ldquo;stars&amp;rdquo; are falling to earth - WeWork goes bankrupt, NFTs blinds people and SBF gets convicted - and we have a perfect storm, economically and geo-politically, raging.</description>

We end with Soviet Jewry emigrating to Israel, the Palestinian Intifada, chaos in Lebanon and the road to, a short-lived, peace.</description>

Will Saudi Arabia do to rugby what it’s trying to do to football, golf, F1 and probably tennis? Imagine Munster owned by a Sheik? Could it happen? As it spends billions in sports-washing, the RWC is surely a shop window event for potential buyers of the game!</description>

In reality it has built a bridge: There&amp;rsquo;s far more trade between the North and the South now. Demography is only going one way and the reaction of the Unionists is immiseration. How else can we interpret the Unionist default position of “the south can’t afford us” other than a strategy to stay poor so that the bill of unity might be too steep for Irish taxpayers?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Having money is only half the battle, deploying it well is the other half. We look at Ireland&amp;rsquo;s financial balance sheet: we&amp;rsquo;re saving far too much! By saving too much, both at the State and the punter level, we are hiding behind the sanctimonious veil of savings rather than involving ourselves in hard thinking, which is what economics is all about. Economists have a bias towards prudence and prudence only, this is highly costly and is an abdication of responsibility.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What does Ireland do for the Irish Diaspora? Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea: why not use Ireland as the re-charging battery for the Irishness of the Global Irish Tribe? Let&amp;rsquo;s use Biden’s visit to Ireland this week to think about how we harness the soft power of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s greatest and unique asset: the tens of millions people around the world who identify as Irish. Soft power is the power of imagination, and in the future a country&amp;rsquo;s soft power will become much more important for our economy.</description>

Many years ago I spent time living and working in Israel which gave me a first hand impression of the country - both good and bad. This week we talk Israel - a country of 9 million people - as that country erupts in anti-government demonstrations, while some in that government talk openly about annexing the West Bank.</description>

We explain this dilemma at the heart of a society - in this case Ireland - but its can be applied to many countries. It is one of the reason why politics seems so unstable even in countries where economic data appears robust. Unless economic figures percolate down to how people are experiencing the economy, they are not only unhelpful but worse, they are antagonising.</description>

The Sino/Russo alliance against the West is solidified between them but the alliance is not one of equals. Russia is China’s petrol station, while China provides Russia with manufacturing goods. This is China&amp;rsquo;s moment. This week we discuss politics, geo-strategy and the enduring appeal, despite its failings, of the West.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the mindset of the West, Russia is a big, significant, military power with significant resources, but is this perception based in reality? Is the reality that Russia is a decrepit state that has failed its people and ransacked its resources? Have the Russians done what they&amp;rsquo;ve done for years, which is lie and spin about its real potential, taking hostages and threatening all around them? In truth it&amp;rsquo;s a large, leaky petrol station with nukes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, we examine how fragile this idea of liberal democracy, where the individual is valued and protected, has become. Yes it has its problems and yes, on a number of fronts, it has not delivered for all, but would you change the combination of liberal democracy and capitalism? There are alternatives out there, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d like to live in any.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s finally happening, the government is going to tax vacant land! Or at least, they’re thinking about it. As a listener to the podcast, you&amp;rsquo;ll be aware that taxing land to bring it into use has been a cornerstone of what is necessary to bring about a more efficient use of land. Not surprisingly, those with most to lose - major landowners/speculators are pushing back. This fight is the future of housing in Ireland (and everywhere).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week&amp;rsquo;s Chinese balloons are only the latest sign of tension between the two superpowers. The relationship between China and the US has deteriorated drastically in the last decade - what happened?

        <description>Podcast Description On last week’s episode we discussed the fact that immigration is good for the economy in the aggregate, but is it good for everyone? As with most things, poorer people and richer people experience life and its challenges differently. Poorer people compete with new immigrants in the housing and jobs market, as well as for public services. This creates tensions. We examine these social tensions, and look for some solutions.</description>

They were building for people yet to be born. This is what we need to build liveable cities right now. Looking at John Gray the 19th century architect of Dublin&amp;rsquo;s water system, we apply Gray&amp;rsquo;s thinking and planning to the of the biggest urban dilemma of the 21st century: housing and urban planning.</description>

The old social contract used to be, work hard, study, get a degree, keep your beak clean and soon enough your income will rise and you will end up richer than your parents. That&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case. The conveyor belt of upward social mobility has stalled. The Millennials are falling behind, while their parents are surging ahead.

So I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many years in that part of the world and have friends from both countries. Last week, I went back to Kyiv with an old Ukrainian mate.</description>

What it couldn&amp;rsquo;t achieve on the battle field Russia aims to achieve in the living room, by trying to freeze ordinary Ukrainians. Today we have a fascinating chat with European Investigative Journalist of the Year Christo Grozev of Bellingcat on how he identified the poisoners of Alexi Navalny and how, using the same techniques, he has identified the Russia&amp;rsquo;s remote killers, the civilian men and women, computer programmers, software engineers and data specialists living normal lives in Russia, who actually push the buttons and program the missiles raining down on Ukraine.</description>

One of the biggest crypto exchange has filled for bankruptcy and across the board crypto currency valuation is in free fall - How did we end up here?

        <description>Podcast Description Within the Euro, given the vastly different economic structures and stage of economic development, some countries, like Ireland, have undervalued exchange rates and others, like Croatia/Italy/Greece have overvalued exchange rates. This means that Ireland experiences massive supply problems, in housing, transport, too much inward investment etc, while the others experience severe deficient demand problems, unemployment, emigration etc. This represents a permanent flaw at the heart of the system; will it be fixed in the next crisis?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description New countries start with no money. The departing colonists take everything with them, including capital. Like all former colonies, the New Ireland had no money. Micheal Collins, revolutionary leader and Minister of Finance, as well as head of the army, laid out a plan. From crowd-funding the 1916-1921 revolution, to setting up a national bank and a new national insurance company, designed to stop capital flowing to London, from marketing Ireland abroad, to rejecting state socialism and focusing on investment both national and foreign, Collins&amp;rsquo; economic vision for Ireland was the direct opposite to either the conservatism of the first 1920s governments or twisted radicalism of De Valera.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Droughts in Europe, resource-wars and global warming got us thinking about Thomas Malthus and his observations about population. Can we square the world&amp;rsquo;s finite resources with the demands of 7 billion wannabe consumers? We talk positive checks, why hunter gathers were taller and ate better than the first farmers, plus the big Malthusian warning from the past, the Irish Famine. In the past two hundred years ,the world prized itself free of the Malthusian Trap via technology; could we be about to fall back into the grip of Malthus?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ireland is a manufacturing powerhouse, producing half as much as the UK per year, despite having a population that is 13 times smaller. With 1% of EU&amp;rsquo;s population, Ireland produces 5% of total EU industrial output. 30 years ago, Ireland had practically no manufacturing base to speak of. How was this transformation achieved? Can it be sustained? Can a strong manufacturing base explain a countries political and social outlook and what else can developed from manufacturing prowess?</description>

Imagine a country blessed with renewable energy, able to power itself and export electricity, faced with the opportunity to completely transform its economy and society and contribute positively to eliminating carbon emissions? That country is Ireland; and outcrop in the north Atlantic buffeted by maritime winds.

Europe&amp;rsquo;s real incomes have been squeezed by &amp;ldquo;Putinflation&amp;rdquo; and emerging markets are running out of dollars.</description>

Why do the Scandinavians do this so well economically, from income, to health, to women feeling safe walking alone at night, Scandinavian countries lead the way, why? Starting from a car wash analogy, we interrogate wage equality, why higher wages at the lower-end are critical to innovation and creating a more fair society - something the Scandinavian countries seem to have figured out ahead of everyone else!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This one’s a special one: we’re coming to you from Inis Meain, the middle island of the three Aran islands to discuss how Covid and connectivity has enhanced our ability to thrive in remote locations, how going upmarket is the way forward and how this small Irish-speaking community is preserving its (and our) roots while at the same time, adjusting to this new modern reality. Ultimately we are witnessing the death of distance, and, in the future, the more distant you are, the more you will benefit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WB Yeats in his poem &amp;ldquo;The Second Coming&amp;rdquo;, described a world, 100 odd years ago, where the forces of economics and politics meant that &amp;ldquo;things fall apart&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the centre cannot hold&amp;rdquo;. In many ways he was right. In 1922, the centre didn&amp;rsquo;t hold, not in Ireland, not anywhere. Things did fall apart. Today we look at the complexion of Irish society as it is, not as sloganeers might want it to be and ask the same question.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Economists are dangerous, so says this week&amp;rsquo;s guest iconoclastic economist,Professor Steve Keen and this is particularly the case if we think about climate change.

        <description>Podcast Description Last week the New York Times took a swipe at Ireland by calling it a tax haven - which it most definitely is not. Using taxes is central to any nation&amp;rsquo;s economic policy. A tax haven is understood to be a place where a company puts a brass plate up, has few if any employees and proceeds to wash money through this shell company. That is not what is happening in Ireland.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Elections all over the world are now power struggles between &amp;ldquo;castes&amp;rdquo;, not so much classes, ideologies or even economics. We look at economic history as being one on going struggle between three castes, the priests, the warriors and the merchants. Each traditional caste has evolved from their historical origins, but they are essentially unchanged in the modern. Today&amp;rsquo;s politics is still dominated by this fascinating three-way struggle, economics is also determined by the winners of this battle.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Some argue that great civilized societies are measured by culture, literature or art but what about the idea that real sophistication is statistics? Truly self-confident societies reveal, expose, shine a light and measure. Calculation is purity. Data matters and to fully understand anything it’s often essential to understand numbers. Why do we use a base 12 for months? 60 for seconds? How do we make sense of the latest political stats?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Yesterday was the worst day to day for new cases of COVID 19 globally since the pandemic started. WE may feel safer, but the world is a dangerous as ever. To combat it, and any future variants, we must respond as a united planet: the reality is we can only open if rich countries pay for the vaccines of poor countries. In 1918 after WW1 we had the League of Nations, in 1948, after WW2 the UN, World Bank, Marshall Plan and the WHO.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and the fruits of many battles- contraception, free and inclusive education, divorce, abortion. Finally, in the West, woman are catching up with men, in income and wealth. This trend will profoundly affect the society and the economy.

        <description>Podcast Description Over the last few decades Ireland has been growing by leaps &amp;amp; bounds, catching up with most of our European neighbours in almost every measurements, social and economic. Part of that story has been the dramatic improvement in the countries&amp;rsquo; capital base as a result of US MNC investment. Ireland has received more US corporate investment that China, Russia, India and Brazil combined!

        <description>Podcast Description Ireland has been in lockdown for 231 days - by far the most stringent lockdown in the EU, so where&amp;rsquo;s the dividend?

        <description>Podcast Description All European countries have seen increases in far-right parties in the last decade. This political affiliation will not just disappear as most people hope it will. This week we look the far-right straight in the eyes and try to understand the underlying sentiments &amp;amp; motives behind the political affiliation. History has shown us the risk of letting it run free. Withe the help of Kevin Cunningham we don&amp;rsquo;t just look at economics and social issue, but personality types &amp;amp; deep human characteristics, inherited from our hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers which unwittingly dictate how we see the world.</description>

If you went out to set up a better way to enrich a violent criminal class, it would be impossible to find a better way. We explain the economic case for the legalization of drugs, tax them and use the proceeds to help those small amount of recreational drug takers who become addicts.</description>

If we can close down the economy, borrow billions, furlough millions and stop the world in the name of public health, we should be able to tear up the rule book when it comes to housing. The property market in Ireland and the rest of the English speaking world is a scam, rigged to push prices upwards, indenturing working families and exacerbating the wealth divide.</description>

This is in stark contrast to the usual market hegemony and might signal a deep change: the little guy is slowly recognizing their power in numbers. If short selling, margin calls, put options, short squeezes are all Double Dutch to you, fret now we have you covered.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ireland, like many economies is hostage to the rentiers, companies that sidle up to governments to get a licence to provide some product or service that the government used to provide. This is a licence to print money, because the rentier company has a monopoly to hoover up rent rather than make anything. They dominate the property market, utilities and have led to the infantilization of the public sector.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The arrival of Joe Biden has led to a profound change in tone, with America quickly re-signing back up to the Paris Accord. The planet is back on the agenda and the mantra of growth at all costs irrespective of the environmental costs, is being reappraised. We talk to Kat Raworth, author of &amp;ldquo;Doughnut Economics&amp;rdquo; about a different way of looking at the world, the economy and how we understand our relationship to the world around us, our priorities and the need to re-frame economics for the 21st century.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We explain by way of the SFX and Doc Martins how financial markets create inequality. Late stage financial capitalism generates super normal profits for owners of capital and debt by way of IPOs, and forces wage moderation on ordinary workers. We explain how understanding the credit cycle is key to understand the modern economy through the prism of the glorious Doc Martin, focusing on trickle down economy, opportunism and leveraged profits and market booms and busts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Trump is over, Trumpism is not. The great American experiment is only starting, as the Republicans become the party of the anxious while, the Democrats - the party of the satisfied. As the world&amp;rsquo;s economic power shifts to Asia, we should try to understand people&amp;rsquo;s real fears. Also, why the world need fewer &amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; economists and more &amp;ldquo;kitchen table&amp;rdquo; economists and will America&amp;rsquo;s next president, Joe Biden lead the charge of change?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Interesting times! As the US is engulfed by a culture war, we look at a culture war closer to home. Here’s why Brexit provides a once in a generation opportunity and how we can seize it. Brexit is a change and change is the one thing that is constant. Embrace it. Economically, there’s huge upside. Politically, it makes constitutional change on this island more likely. We are chatting to Andrea Catherwood on the future of Ireland, how to avoid our own culture war and how we best negotiate it from here.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Welcome back to the podcast 2021! During the height of the civil rights campaign when people were dying needlessly, Martin Luther King deployed this expression “the extreme urgency of now” to describe the urgency of achieving civil rights immediately, not sometime in the future. Precisely the same can be said about the vaccine. Every day is crucial and the roll out of the vaccine will be the litmus test for how serious your country is!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As Brexit moves towards the endgame and the UK government’s new policy appears to centre on inflicting as much economic damage as possible on Ireland to change the “backstop”, we explore why the Brexiteers are so ignorant about Ireland, how come Ireland is now considerably richer than the UK, more globalized and more resilient. In short, when so-called “Global Britain” exports 1.5 times more to “little” Ireland than it does to China, you know the Brexiteers are living in an economic la la land!</description>

In this podcast, we are going to look at the upcoming European elections and in particular, the rise of populist parties, through the lens of Irish history and specifically, what happened in American politics in reaction to 1000 Irish emigrants a day arriving, poor and destitute into New York in the 1840s and 1850s.
