So when Budget 2024 is announced next week, can some of that money be spent on easing the cost of living crisis and tackling issues like decarbonisation, housing and health?

How has it happened that the largest freshwater lake in Ireland and Britain has become toxic and, as Northern Ireland still does not have a working government in Stormont, what can be done to reverse this disaster?
Northern editor Freya McClements visited Lough Neagh to talk to people whose lives have been impacted and to report on the deadly effects on wildlife and biodiversity and on the water supplies feeding into homes in Belfast and beyond.</description></item><item><title>The Sallins Train Robbery: Will the wrongly accused ever get justice? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490052/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 03:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490052/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Sallins Train Robbery in 1976 was one of the most audacious criminal acts ever in the State. The Dublin to Cork mail train, carrying £200,000, was robbed with the IRA (much later) claiming responsibility, but only after three innocent men had been jailed.&amp;nbsp;
The men were tried, convicted and imprisoned as part of a convoluted saga involving the non-jury Special Criminal Court, claims of physical assault, forced confessions and a finding by the court that injuries sustained while in custody by some of the men were self-inflicted.</description></item><item><title>Sally Hayden: A 'naval blockade' won't solve the crisis in the Mediterranean | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490053/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 04:00:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490053/</guid><description>Podcast Description To understand the unfolding crisis on the Italian island of Lampedusa, where a state of emergency has been declared as 7,000 migrants arrived on boats within just 48 hours, it’s crucial to look across the short stretch of the Mediterranean to Tunisia. Sally Hayden, who has been reporting on the migrant crisis and the EU’s response to it, explains in this podcast why there has been a surge of people arriving on Lampedusa; why she believes Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s proposed “naval blockade” will not work; the controversial €105 million deal between the EU and Tunisian president Kaïs Saïed, who has encouraged violence against black people in the country; and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s visit last week to the Italian island.</description></item><item><title>Why did spinal surgeries on children fail in one Dublin hospital? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490054/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 04:00:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490054/</guid><description>Podcast Description Children suffering from spina bifida have been let down by an under-resourced healthcare system for years.

It follows them as they rise separately through the ranks of the sport, before their lives eventually become intertwined.

Entering the tournament in France as the number one team in the world is no guarantee of anything – and the big question is whether Andy Farrell’s team can do what previous Ireland teams have never managed; progress beyond the quarter final. That’s if they get there – the way the draw has worked out this year is that the pool is divided into an easy side and a hard one and Ireland is in the hard one alongside reigning world champions South Africa, and Scotland.</description></item><item><title>What is behind China's economic woes? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490063/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 03:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490063/</guid><description>Podcast Description Chinese economic growth is faltering. The biggest drag on the economy is the tanking property market, with prices falling and developers defaulting. Domestic demand is dropping as nervous consumers opt to save rather than spend. That’s bad news too for the vital manufacturing sector. Add double-digit youth unemployment and the problems are piling up for president Xi Jinping.

The news sparked renewed debate about when it is right to change the historic name of a building or institution, with Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole arguing, for example, that the dozen or so GAA clubs named after 19th century Irish nationalist John Mitchel should rename themselves, also due to Mitchel's support for slavery and his trenchant racism.</description></item><item><title>How is cocaine getting into Ireland? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490072/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 03:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490072/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ireland is awash with cocaine, but how does it get into the country?

However, the nation was more than a little distracted by events in Montrose and the RTÉ secret pay deal scandal and the forum may have passed many people by.

It’s very easy for him to find others are to blame.”
Enniskillen-born filmmaker, Trevor Birney, has spent five years on his documentary, Quinn Country, which aired on RTE late last year. The three-part series paints a visceral portrait of a man haunted by feelings of injustice and betrayal; not least in part due to the contributions from the former billionaire himself, from his palatial home in Co.</description></item><item><title>Rental crisis: why can't Ireland put limits on AirBnb? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490149/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 04:00:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490149/</guid><description>Podcast Description The landlord of a Dublin apartment block, who evicted tenants last year claiming he intended to sell up, has been found by Dublin City Council to be using the property for unauthorised holiday letting.
The rooms began appearing on AirBnB, the holiday rental site. And the price? Up to €100 euro a night for a bunkbed in a shared room, or €280 for a private one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Bernice Harrison talks to Dublin Editor Olivia Kelly about the case and to political correspondent Cormac McQuinn about why moves to regulate short-term lets - potentially freeing up thousands of properties for long-term housing - have not been realised.</description></item><item><title>Sex education overhaul: 'It’s great that porn is going to be addressed' | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490150/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 03:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490150/</guid><description>Podcast Description Sex education in Ireland is getting a revamp.

It&amp;rsquo;s almost 39 years to the day since Baby John, as he was later named, washed up on a beach near Cahersiveen in Co. Kerry.

It has the power to transform the lives of people with complex obesity. It’s only available in Ireland for people with Type 2 diabetes – and in very limited circumstances for those with obesity.

But experts have examined the possibility the virus escaped - accidentally or otherwise - from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Now the head of the FBI says that's the "most likely" scenario.

On that fateful night, nine Kerrymen were rounded up by the Free State army to be murdered in a revenge killing. The ruthless act saw them tied together around a bomb.

Kitty Holland, Irish Times social affairs correspondent and Roisin Clark, interim chief executive of Mental Health Reform, an advocacy group representing organisations throughout the country, explain the background and what the report means for Camhs and the HSE.</description></item><item><title>How did mafioso Matteo Messina Denaro evade capture for thirty years? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490185/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 04:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490185/</guid><description>Podcast Description Despite claims fugitive mob boss, Matteo Messino Denaro, was in Amsterdam, Liverpool and Brazil, the 60 year-old had been hiding in plain sight in Sicily. He was arrested last week after 30 years on the run. Italian criminologist, Dr Anna Sergi, says he was caught after being tracked down through plain old-fashioned detective work. Dr Sergi explains to host, Aideen Finnegan, why the Sicilian mafia boss' arrest is so significant, and what it was like to grow up in a region of Italy marred by terrifying mob violence.</description></item><item><title>Richard Corrigan’s restaurant: ‘I would never work under those conditions ever, ever again' | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490186/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 04:00:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490186/</guid><description>Podcast Description "Elsa" had decades of experience waiting in restaurants before joining the staff at celebrity chef Richard Corrigan's new Dublin restaurant last year. Within a few weeks she had joined over a dozen other staff who left.

Heated protests outside buildings used to house asylum seekers in Ballymun, East Wall and around the country show how anti-immigration sentiment is being stirred up by groups who are organised, heavily reliant on social media and increasingly adept at exploiting fears, often with baseless stories.
Irish Times crime correspondent Conor Gallagher has been tracking the rise of the far right in Ireland in recent years and has reported on how misinformation is fuelling these increasingly heated gatherings of locals and far-right groups.</description></item><item><title>Religion in schools: What do people really want? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490188/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2023 05:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490188/</guid><description>Podcast Description About 90 per cent of primary schools in Ireland are Catholic in ethos. The figure is increasingly out of line with the religious makeup of the population.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Last week, an Athlone primary school switched from Catholic to multi-denominational, the first such change of school ethos in a state-led pilot programme. But in other areas, like Dublin's Raheny, local opposition to such changes in school ethos has been strong. So when it comes to religion in schools, what is it that people really want?</description></item><item><title>Prince Harry: Apparently we do care about the heir and the spare | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490189/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 04:00:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490189/</guid><description>Podcast Description Just when you thought there was nothing new to learn about Britain's Prince Harry's explosive memoir, it manages to generate even more headlines upon its release this week.

The country has fully reopened, ending the requirement for inbound travellers to quarantine. The abrupt exit has resulted in covid ripping through its main cities and struck a defiant tone with the European Union, which has recommended testing for passengers arriving from China. But the reopening will likely be a boost to the world economy and a welcome relief for its citizens and foreigners who felt unable to leave for the past three years.</description></item><item><title>What did I miss over Christmas? | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490192/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 04:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490192/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this special episode of In The News we are joined by our new co-host, Bernice Harrison, and departing presenter, Conor Pope.

In this episode, he talks to Sorcha Pollak about those ten years spent working alongside one of the most important and recognised people on earth, the long days and nights spent crafting the former US president’s statements and the pressure, self-doubt and ultimate sense of accomplishment of holding “the best and the worst job in the West Wing”.</description></item><item><title>Best of 2022: Tibnin Bridge, the 1982 murder of 3 Irish peacekeeping soldiers. | In The News</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2206490195/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 05:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2206490195/</guid><description>Podcast Description Since the 1970s, Irish soldiers have served as UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon, a region where complex conflicts ebb and flow.

It’s a massive advance in AI and machine learning that can handle far more complex requests, and generate answers in human-like form. It doesn’t scour the internet or copy and paste from articles.

A straightforward binary question would yield a resounding yes on this side of the border, and an emphatic no from the six counties.
That result is clear from a two polls carried out in both jurisdictions by Ipsos for The Irish Times.

Since an RTÉ radio documentary about child sexual abuse at Blackrock College aired last month, charity One In Four has been inundated with calls from survivors of abuse, seeking therapy and help in finding justice, often after decades of suffering in silence. But the research shows that child sexual abuse is far from just a legacy issue in Ireland.

Enniskillen-born filmmaker, Trevor Birney, has spent five years on his documentary, Quinn Country, which aired on RTE this week.
