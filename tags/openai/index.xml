Here, a ten-minute-old newborn sees another person stick their tongue out for the first
time.
In response, he sticks his own tongue out.
Imitation allows humans to learn new behaviors rapidly.
We would like our robots to be able to learn this way, too.
We’ve built a proof of concept system, trained entirely in simulation: we teach the robot</description>

it might scale to something that&amp;rsquo;s hundred a thousand times bigger.
This is a place where you can get to do that.
OpenAI is building the general technologies that can extend the reach
of the human brain and our creativity.
Dall-E really brings high quality creations to anyone.

Didn’t think so.
DALL-E 2 is a new AI system from OpenAI that can take simple text descriptions like, “a

existed before.
DALL-E 2 can also realistically edit and retouch photos.

The lab that created Dall-E.
And ChatGPT.
GPT-4 is a breakthrough in problem solving capabilities.
For example, you can ask it how you would clean the inside of
a tank filled with piranhas.
And it&amp;rsquo;ll give you something useful.
It can also read, analyze, or generate up to 25,000 words of text.
It can write code in all major programming languages.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Today, we can use AI to write poetry
compose music
write computer programs
Very quickly, we can end up in a place where machines are far more capable
than us in science, and they can help us solve very hard scientific problems
that humans are not capable of solving themselves.
So what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting is as AI systems get more capable,
they don&amp;rsquo;t automatically become better at doing what humans want.</description>

about some of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing
here with Sonic and alia on sort of an
Avenue that we think might be a
promising way to make invertible
generative models potentially more
efficient and more expressive and so as
I mentioned when you&amp;rsquo;re defining or
designing an invertible generative model
you have two main constraints when when
doing this you need the model to be</description>

to believe that this day is here.
OpenAI has been building this technology really
since we started the company.
But for the past two years, we&amp;rsquo;ve
been really focused on delivering GPT-4.
That started with rebuilding our entire training stack,
actually training the model, and then
seeing what it was capable of, trying to figure out</description>
