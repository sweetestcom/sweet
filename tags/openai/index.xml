Here, a ten-minute-old newborn sees another person stick their tongue out for the first
time.
In response, he sticks his own tongue out.
Imitation allows humans to learn new behaviors rapidly.
We would like our robots to be able to learn this way, too.

Playing Dota means you have to coordinate and focus as a team of five.
Last year, we built a bot that defeated the world&amp;rsquo;s best players at the 1v1 mini game.
But this year, we want to beat the best pro teams at the full game.
To do this, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a new AI system, which we&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few months training.</description></item><item><title>Social learning in independent multi-agent reinfor… ｜ Kamal N’dousse ｜ OpenAI Scholars Demo Day 2020 ｜ OpenAI</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/qy9j5519s68/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 03:40:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/qy9j5519s68/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿hello everyone I am excited to be

Here a robot has learned to rotate a block into any orientation we&amp;rsquo;d like.
Once it succeeds at that we give it a new goal and so on.
The system runs on a human-like robot hand and we use reinforcement learning and
simulation to teach the robot how to solve tasks in the real world.</description></item><item><title>OpenAI Five vs. OG, Game 1 ｜ OpenAI Five Finals (3⧸6) ｜ OpenAI</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/lvrpwrvhvne/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 02:39:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/lvrpwrvhvne/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿ladies and gentlemen the International

compose music
write computer programs
Very quickly, we can end up in a place where machines are far more capable
than us in science, and they can help us solve very hard scientific problems
that humans are not capable of solving themselves.
So what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting is as AI systems get more capable,
they don&amp;rsquo;t automatically become better at doing what humans want.</description></item><item><title>GPT-4 Developer Livestream ｜ OpenAI</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/outcgtbnmuq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:20:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/outcgtbnmuq/</guid><description>Video Transcript ﻿foreign
