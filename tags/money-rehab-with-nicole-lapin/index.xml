Trust us, in the next elections— hate will be on the ballot, so make sure you’re not voting for it. Beyond donating to political campaigns, you can also run in them. That’s what Consuelo Hernandez did, a Jewish Latina politician who is currently serving as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives. Today, Nicole shares a sneak preview of Consuelo&amp;rsquo;s episode on MNN&amp;rsquo;s Money Maker | Mi Mundo Rico podcast hosted by Nely Galán where Consuelo gives a roadmap of how you can get involved in local politics— as a politician, or as a citizen - and why several acts of violence against her family drove her to choose a life in politics, and make a difference.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Nicole chats with author, political activist and spiritual thought leader Marianne Williamson on the financial implications of overturning Roe v. Wade.

Typically, we assume that Democrats are pro-choice and Republicans are pro-life, but as Marianne would argue— it’s not that simple, and not one political party gets it 100% right. In this episode, Marianne gives useful recommendations on abortion legislation, that notes room for improvement for both Republicans and Democrats.</description>
