MRI scans are infamously claustrophobic and anxiety-inducing procedures. During his own MRI, the author was surprised to find solace and inspiration in the barrage of sounds he was subjected to lying within the machine.

His iconic hit is now the anthem for “Yes” voters, who say their vote is about being on the right side of history. For “No” voters, the ad is superficial – pandering to emotions rather than giving concrete reasons to support the Voice. Meanwhile, tactics from the opposition have included pitching a second referendum and undermining the “Yes” campaign’s ad by pointing to a key lyric.</description></item><item><title>‘Liars and cowards’ in the ADF | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040087/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040087/</guid><description>Podcast Description The royal commission into veteran suicides is probing the ugliest parts of the Australian defence force.

Norway has had an indigenous-led Parliament for more than three decades, with local representatives advising on issues that impact their people.

That is the vision sketched out by Senator Lidia Thorpe this week in a landmark speech.

If it seems like it’s too good to be true, climate experts say, that’s because it is. Why is Labor supporting the contentious science behind carbon capture and storage, and does it amount to anything more than greenwashing?</description></item><item><title>The Weekend Read: Christos Tsiolkas on pieces of fiction that stay with us forever | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040107/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040107/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today on the show, author Christos Tsiolkas with a recent piece from The Monthly. “The Past is a foreign country: they do things differently there” – is the memorable opening line of L.P.

The first-term senator came into parliament with the best intentions to avert the climate crisis, but has sometimes found himself having to work to make legislation he thinks is bad, a little bit better. Now, he’s trying to put forward a solution he does actually believe in: a private senator’s bill that would force politicians to consider the impact on the health and wellbeing of future generations when they make decisions on climate.</description></item><item><title>Albanese vs the ‘Noalition’: It’s about to get spicy | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040113/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040113/</guid><description>Podcast Description Parliament is back – and it ain’t pretty!

It’s an historic appointment. Michele Bullock is the first ever woman to hold the position. She was, until now, second in charge. It comes after the controversial term of Philip Lowe, who provoked public anger for suggesting interest rates wouldn’t rise until 2024, and then hiking them 12 times in just over a year.

There were many cases like his, but Rhys Cauzzo’s experience under robo-debt sparked a fight for justice that still continues. Rhys Cauzzo killed himself in January 2017. The public servants and ministers responsible for this illegal debt-raising scheme effectively started a PR war to smear the reputation of a dead man.</description></item><item><title>Inside Robo-debt: The Minister’s Adviser | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040131/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040131/</guid><description>Podcast Description Robo-debt should never have made it into the real world, but once it did, its gatekeepers became greedy and turned the scheme on full throttle.
In late 2016, without warning, more than 100,000 people across Australia were swamped by life-altering debts stretching back years.
That became a political problem. A scheme politicians thought was a neat and tidy solution to their own ambitions quickly spiralled into a humanitarian disaster.</description></item><item><title>Inside Robo-debt: The Social Engineering of Shame | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040132/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040132/</guid><description>Podcast Description How did robo-debt ever make it out of the lab?
We may never get a perfect answer to that question. But there is one person who can help piece together how this astounding period of public service fakery was uncovered.
You see, the flaws in robo-debt were not discovered by any government department or oversight body, like the ombudsman&amp;rsquo;s office. They were revealed by a group of people on Twitter: lawyers, journalists and welfare recipients.</description></item><item><title>Inside Robo-debt: The Whistleblower | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040133/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040133/</guid><description>Podcast Description Those who imagined, designed and delivered robo-debt put their personal ambition above the wellbeing of the people they were meant to serve. But there were some on the frontline who knew from the very beginning that this government shakedown was wrong.
One, Colleen Taylor, came forward at the royal commission. While senior leaders failed to recall, or refused to say how robo-debt happened, she told the truth and helped crack one of the biggest scandals in Australian government history wide open.</description></item><item><title>Inside Robo-debt: The Shorten interview | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040134/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040134/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia was gaslit by its own government. From ministers to public servants – they backed something that was illegal, just to shake down innocent people for money, then lied about it for years. There will likely be criminal prosecutions, civil action and more accountability to meat out. But Robo-debt was also born out of a cultural rot inside politics and our public service – it’s a culture that could go on to do more damage if it isn’t stopped.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Read This: We Went to Helen Garner's House | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040135/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040135/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week we&amp;rsquo;re bringing you something special.

Meanwhile, a Queensland police officer was caught on video punching and Tasering a man who’d been in a car crash, and will be investigated by an internal police standards body.</description></item><item><title>Crimes and Misdemeanours: Donald Trump and Hunter Biden | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040147/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040147/</guid><description>Podcast Description We learned this week that United States president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, will accept a plea deal on federal tax crimes. With the 2024 presidential race already underway, Republicans are calling the deal evidence of nepotism and corruption – none more loudly than Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Trump, of course, is facing a much more lengthy federal indictment, with 37 charges against him. That could mean a prison sentence running several decades if he’s found guilty at his upcoming trial.</description></item><item><title>Max Chandler-Mather on why the Greens blocked the housing fund | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040148/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040148/</guid><description>Podcast Description The government’s housing policy could be dead in the water. On Monday, the Greens chose to block the legislation – by deferring the vote on the bill until October. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the delay is the same as rejecting it, and he’s seeking urgent legal advice about whether this could be a trigger for a double dissolution of parliament – which could bring on an early election.</description></item><item><title>How the justice system failed Kathleen Folbigg | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040149/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040149/</guid><description>Podcast Description Kathleen Folbigg was once known as Australia’s worst female serial killer – now she’s free after being pardoned. New scientific evidence played a big role in her release. But there are other issues that drove the media and the justice system’s condemnation of Folbigg. The way her psychological state, her grief and her reliability were questioned speak to the treatment of women who are accused of murder. Today, contributor to The Saturday Paper Wendy Bacon, on the fight for Kathleen Folbigg’s pardon and why it points to more wrongful convictions within our justice system.</description></item><item><title>Peacock in the Pacific: Inside Australia’s bid to host COP31 | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040150/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040150/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Albanese government is campaigning to host the next United Nations Climate Conference in partnership with Pacific nations. Some have described this as an Olympic moment, but there is real concern it’s just an exercise in public relations and greenwashing Australia’s climate policies. In response, Pacific countries are now demanding Australia do more on climate action before agreeing to be part of the bid. Today, contributor to The Saturday Paper, Polly Hemming on how Australia is peacocking in the Pacific.</description></item><item><title>Why private schools are ruining Australia | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040151/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040151/</guid><description>Podcast Description One way that inequality becomes baked into Australian society is through education. For decades, the school system has become increasingly stratified – to the benefit of private schools and detriment of public ones.

While Australians often can’t skip a rent payment, they can skip a meal. And as the cost of living soars, more and more Australians are going hungry.

The Coalition says the texts show evidence of “collusion” and “weaponisation” on the part of the Labor government. But as the political scandal spirals, the source of the texts, the motives for the leak and the consequences of them being published have remained mostly unexamined.</description></item><item><title>Why the Voice can’t be the only answer | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040156/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040156/</guid><description>Podcast Description While the push towards a Voice to Parliament continues, decisions are still being made that affect the lives of Indigenous people. Mines continue to open on traditional lands, in states around the country the age of criminal responsibility remains as young as 10 years old, and the gap is not closing. There are plenty of things that governments across the country could be doing right now to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians, but politicians seem to be focused only on the future.</description></item><item><title>Spotlight: Why is Australia importing anti-trans activists? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040157/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040157/</guid><description>Podcast Description A speaking tour claiming to quote “let women speak” has been at the centre of disturbing scenes across Australia.

And the strangest part of all: the leadership of the commission has allegedly been pretending there isn’t a problem. Today, senior reporter for The Saturday Paper Rick Morton, on how the organisation that oversees the NDIS was gaslighting its own staff, and what that means for those who rely on the service.</description></item><item><title>The people who knew the truth about PwC for years | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040160/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040160/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Australian Tax Office suspected that PwC used confidential information to help their big corporate clients get richer – seven whole years ago. But they did shockingly little about it. They didn’t even share that information with government ministers. The reason, they say, is that their hands were tied – that bureaucratic rules kept them from exposing one of the biggest scandals in the history of our tax system.</description></item><item><title>How the Pentagon plans to mine Australia’s minerals | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040161/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040161/</guid><description>Podcast Description A new green energy agreement with the US, signed by President Biden and Prime Minister Albanese, will allow the Pentagon to fund mining projects in Australia. It’s part of a race to control the energy sources of the future, and associated technologies – everything from computer chips to electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. So what does this deal mean for our security, as the US tries to match China’s progress using Australia’s natural resources – and are we getting a good deal?</description></item><item><title>We can say it now: Ben Roberts-Smith is a war criminal | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040162/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040162/</guid><description>Podcast Description Ben Roberts-Smith dined with prime ministers, attended the Queen’s funeral as a hero and was held up as an icon of the Australian Defense Force. In fact, a huge portrait of him still hangs in the Australian War Memorial today. But now, a court has found that allegations Ben Roberts-Smith is a murderer, a war criminal and a bully who disgraced his country have been proven.

Mungo was a totally unique character of Australian journalism – once described by Gough Whitlam a &amp;ldquo;tall, bearded descendant of lunatic aristocrats&amp;rdquo; – he could deftly bounce from the funny and odd to the great stories and issues of our times.</description></item><item><title>The politicians who think the sky is falling | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040164/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040164/</guid><description>Podcast Description Anthony Albanese says politicians are running around Canberra claiming the sky is falling. “Chicken littles”, he’s calling them, doomsayers trying to whip up unfounded fears about the Voice. Opposition leader Peter Dutton has reacted as if the reference to the old folk tale is a deeply insulting slur, but it’s hardly the most charged language that’s been used by one of our politicians in recent weeks.

Albanese promises a bold reformist agenda, but the government often appears cautious and slow in its delivery. Anthony Albanese himself comes from the left of the party, but opponents like the Greens have called his government ‘centre-right’.</description></item><item><title>Stan Grant and Australia's failure to talk about racism | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040166/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040166/</guid><description>Podcast Description When Australia’s most high-profile Indigenous journalist was forced to step away from his role because of racist abuse – it made headlines around the world. But here in Australia, most of the media and our political leaders have struggled to comprehend the meaning of the moment – and appear to be trapped in a cycle of well-wishes, apologies and outright denial instead of taking action.

But did you know that on any given night more than a million homes in Australia sit empty? That’s more than 10 per cent of Australia’s housing stock. The shortage is not in homes, but in affordable homes.

The scandal engulfing PwC is one of the biggest to ever hit the cosy relationship between the government and private consultancy firms. And it goes beyond a few bad actors – pointing to a broken system, and a demoralised public service. Today, associate editor of The Saturday Paper Martin McKenzie-Murray, on what happened when the Australian government trusted PwC to fix our tax system.</description></item><item><title>The real reason the robo-debt royal commission asked for a delay | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040171/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040171/</guid><description>Podcast Description There’s been a delay in the release of what could be the most explosive findings from a royal commission in decades. The commissioner of the robo-debt investigation quietly wrote to the attorney general to request a delay in the publication of its final report. But this is no mere bureaucratic hold-up, there are other reasons behind it. And one of them has to do with when Australia’s new National Anti-Corruption Commission will be ready to receive referrals.</description></item><item><title>Is Labor gaslighting voters on climate? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040172/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040172/</guid><description>Podcast Description After more than half of voters at the 2022 federal election said climate change was a top concern, helping Labor take power, it became known as the ‘climate election’. But a year on, how much has really changed? A 43 per cent carbon emission reduction target has been legislated, and the government promises we’ll reach net zero – but fossil fuel projects are still being approved.

That’s because a gram of cocaine sells in Australia for as much as $400. But the public rarely gets an insight into this enormous sector of criminal enterprise. How cocaine gets into the country, where the money goes and the violence involved is often veiled in secrecy.</description></item><item><title>The Weekend Read: Sasha Gattermayr on an obsession with carnivorous plants | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040174/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040174/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today on the show, Sasha Gattermayr, with her piece on the fascination with carnivorous plants from The Monthly magazine. Sasha takes us inside a band of collectors whose obsession with plants such as the venus fly trap turned into a lifelong devotion to plants that devour their prey.

We’ve seen it before, but not like this – the power that Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted private military company the Wagner group is unprecedented. And Putin may be discovering its drawbacks the hard way – as the public face of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin feuds with his generals and embarrassing stories have emerged in the Western press.</description></item><item><title>Australia’s first women’s advisor on why she left the country | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040177/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040177/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia can claim a significant world first: a special government adviser on Women’s Affairs. Fifty years ago, Elizabeth Reid stepped into the newly created role in Gough Whitlam’s government. Abortion access, workplace rights, contraception and education – it was a time of huge change in gender parity and access. But the reaction to Reid and the new position was vicious in some circles.

When the most high profile sexual assault trial in Australia was called off, and any hope of a retrial abandoned, there was one question: how did it come to this? The actions of one juror might have led to the mistrial, but there was more to the story: concerns about how the media covered the trial were followed by explosive allegations against the ACT police and how they handled the case.</description></item><item><title>Farewell, Stuart Robert.

Often they depart the stage without anyone really noticing, other times it’s worth pausing and marking their storied parliamentary careers. That’s the case for Stuart Robert, who has called time on politics after 16 years – during which time he presided over the robo debt scandal, a bag of Rolexes, and made his name as Scott Morrison’s ‘brother Stewie’.</description></item><item><title>The middle class vs. the poor: Why the Coalition wants them to fight | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040180/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040180/</guid><description>Podcast Description Since the budget dropped on Tuesday night, the Coalition and some parts of the media have begun to pick a very strange fight. It’s over whether some of the most vulnerable in the community should really get more help than middle-class Australian households with two incomes. It pits the two against each other and ignores a much bigger cost coming down the pipeline: tax cuts that will benefit the wealthiest Australians the most.</description></item><item><title>Peter Dutton’s Liberal party is turning on its closest ally | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040181/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040181/</guid><description>Podcast Description There’s one relationship the Liberal Party has always prized: its relationship with business. Other support bases for the party have ebbed and flowed, but the party has always drawn from the ranks of corporate Australia, and advocated for their interests.

It’s a reversal of a controversial decision made by the Gillard government. So does this signal a broader attempt to address the standard of living for the most vulnerable Australians? Or, is it a rare bit of relief in an otherwise tough budget? Today, Finance Minister and Minister for Women Katy Gallagher on how her own time on the single parent payment shaped her views and what the government is doing about the housing crisis.</description></item><item><title>So, the coronation was pretty weird – with Craig Foster | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040184/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040184/</guid><description>Podcast Description If, over the weekend, you watched the coronation of King Charles, stood up in your living room and read out a pledge of allegiance – you were probably in the minority of Australians. But that was the invitation from the palace in the lead-up to Saturday evening’s coronation ceremony. So, how relevant is King Charles III? Is a republic now possible? And how quickly could another referendum be upon us?</description></item><item><title>The Weekend Read: Quentin Sprague on shocking reports in the Aboriginal art industry | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040185/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040185/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today, writer Quentin Sprague, with his piece from The Monthly. He examines the recent revelations of “white hands on black art” – reports of White gallery figures instructing and even working on the canvases of Indigenous artists – and examines how white Australia applies the idea of ‘authenticity’ onto the work of Indigenous artists.

So far, it looks like the economic assistance the government will offer in the upcoming budget will be targeted. It probably won’t raise JobSeeker — except for over 55s — and it’s unlikely to pause rising HECS debt. So, after a decade or more of young people falling behind economically, will we see any help at all on budget night?</description></item><item><title>Why is the ADF ‘not fit’ to deter China? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040187/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040187/</guid><description>Podcast Description Missiles that can precisely target enemy forces 500 kilometres away are the future of the Australian defence forces, according to the recent defence strategic review. What we are defending ourselves with today is woefully inadequate for our strategic circumstances, the review found. But other big questions are emerging: how will we pay for the changes it’s proposing? Can we save money on purchases we’ve already agreed to? And how will our neighbours react to a more capable Australian military?</description></item><item><title>How HECS became a debt trap | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040188/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040188/</guid><description>Podcast Description If you went to university, there’s an increasing likelihood you could be carrying HECS debt for several decades. There are now more than 300,000 people carrying HECS into their 50s — six times more people than just over 15 years ago. And, this June, HECS debts are set to rise again at a historic pace.

But the case is being made for the poorest and most disadvantaged among us to get more support in the upcoming budget. But is it true? And if it is, are there ways to repair the budget that would leave enough money to help raise people out of poverty? Today, economist and CEO of the Grattan Institute, Danielle Wood, on how we can afford to raise the rate, and more ways to fix the budget.</description></item><item><title>Why can the government spend money on weapons but not welfare? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040191/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040191/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week, the way the government chooses to spend its money was put into sharp focus. On Monday, it announced a bold new plan for military spending, but soon after, it found itself besieged by calls to raise the rate of JobSeeker – for Australians struggling with poverty. So, why can we afford to spend money on one, but not the other? And is it a question that voters will start asking?</description></item><item><title>Just how ‘elite’ are the people behind the Voice? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040192/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040192/</guid><description>Podcast Description Criticism of the Voice to Parliament from the conservative side of politics has ratcheted up ever since Peter Dutton’s decision to oppose it. The main accusations are: the proposal for the Voice is coming from elites and not ‘regular’ Indigenous Australians, and it won’t achieve practical change.

But yesterday, the Reserve Bank bowed to a scathing review and even Governor Philip Lowe conceded parts of the RBA had been out of step with modern expectations. But will a new board of experts improve the way interest rates are set? Can workers have a seat at the table?

His choice was Jacinta Nampijinpa Price – a first-term senator. So who is Dutton’s new pick? How did she rise so quickly through the ranks?

It’s called the National Mental Health Commission. But inside the commission, some of the staff that are supposed to be coming up with solutions have faced layoffs, stress, anxiety, and worse. So, how did a commission set up with the best intentions turn into such a struggle for staff?</description></item><item><title>#MeToo and Canberra’s reckoning: how a mix of scandals and leadership led to change | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040200/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040200/</guid><description>Podcast Description Kate Jenkins has wrapped up a distinguished term as Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner. In her seven years in the job, we’ve seen the global Me Too movement, along with the reckoning in Canberra sparked by allegations from former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins. So how have these cultural moments impacted the push for gender equality in this country? And what still needs to change? Today, Kate Jenkins on how far we’ve come – and the work that’s still not done.</description></item><item><title>We were told to recycle plastic.

Australians were told to sort through their bins, and take plastic bags and packaging to drop-offs at the country’s biggest supermarkets to have them recycled. But instead of being recycled, tonnes and tonnes of this plastic was shoved into storage. Now, authorities are still trying to track it all down.

This week, the party’s spokesperson on Indigenous Australians resigned his post, and the party’s most high-profile Indigenous figure tore up his party membership. So how did it come to this? And have these splits torpedoed Peter Dutton’s case just as he’s begun to make it?</description></item><item><title>Forget inflation.

But what often isn’t acknowledged by the Reserve Bank, its governor, or many of our political leaders, is that some people are doing just fine in these economic conditions – in fact, they can benefit from them. Those people are the wealthiest Australians – in particular, people who have paid off their houses and are debt free.</description></item><item><title>Why Australia won’t ban TikTok before the US does | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040204/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040204/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia isn’t the first country to ban TikTok from government devices. In fact, all of our closest allies have already taken steps to keep the app away from government secrets. So how justified are these fears? Is the next step a forced sale? Or even a total ban?

That question now rests on Penny Wong’s shoulders.

The issue of far-right extremism has often been covered in Australia as a political issue, but what about as an issue of safety and security? Today, we revisit our conversation with the author of ‘Rise of the Extreme Right’, Lydia Khalil, on the far-right in Australia, its connections around the world and the best way to stop it from growing.</description></item><item><title>The Weekend Read: Lucianne Tonti on the battle to stop wasting brand-new clothes | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040207/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040207/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today on the show, author of ‘Sundressed’ and fashion editor for The Saturday Paper Lucianne Tonti reads her piece on confronting the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of clothing condemned to landfill every year. The Australian fashion industry is a major cause of the 227,000 tonnes of waste clothing generated each year — much of it never worn before being discarded. Non-profits are attempting to curb the issue, redirecting and recycling the waste clothing – but the problem lies at the source: overproduction.</description></item><item><title>Spotlight: How death became the fight of Andrew Denton’s life | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040208/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040208/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia is one of just a handful of countries around the world that have legislated in favour of euthanasia. Every Australian state has now legalised voluntary assisted dying – and the territories are expected to follow after the federal government granted them freedom to legislate. That situation would have been hard to imagine when Andrew Denton first joined the campaign for voluntary assisted dying. Known for his penetrating television interviews, Andrew found a debate where progress had been stymied and the voices of those affected most – the dying – weren’t being heard.</description></item><item><title>No Voice and no votes: the future of the Liberal Party | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040209/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040209/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Liberal Party has finally come to a position on the Voice to parliament: No. Opposition leader Peter Dutton’s announcement comes in the wake of two election defeats for the Liberal party in two weeks, first in the NSW state election and then in the Aston by-election in Victoria.

With the population growing, homes are going to be in short supply, particularly affordable homes. The government wants to build new houses with an investment fund, the Greens want a rent freeze and more guaranteed funding for affordable homes – and negotiations are becoming the latest flashpoint in a bitter dispute between the two parties.</description></item><item><title>The state locking up more children than any other | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040211/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040211/</guid><description>Podcast Description One state in Australia locks up more children than any other: Queensland. And new laws will send more children into custody than ever before. The laws go against its Human Rights Act, but the state has chosen to override those protections in response to growing media pressure about youth crime. Today, Queensland Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall on the rights of children in a state that’s going to lock up more of them – and how his office has been sidelined.</description></item><item><title>Is Murdoch media about to turn against the Voice? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040212/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040212/</guid><description>Podcast Description A scare campaign is gathering momentum in the conservative media. Will the Voice to Parliament dictate policy? Are elite interests behind the referendum? And does it threaten the integrity of the constitution? These are the questions being asked by conservative commentators, mostly in the Murdoch-owned national newspaper. But The Australian wasn’t supposed to be opposed to the referendum – there was a time when it was one of the Voice’s biggest allies.</description></item><item><title>Inside Peter Dutton’s leadership test in Aston | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040213/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040213/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Liberal Party is in a state of disarray. After the NSW election loss, powerbrokers and former strategists were airing dirty laundry – has the party forgotten the traditional values it stands for? Has it failed to offer younger voters anything? Or is there just not enough talent in its ranks? Well, this weekend these questions could multiply as the federal party faces the ballot box under Peter Dutton’s leadership for the first time, at the Aston by-election.</description></item><item><title>Trump 2024: Why Republicans want to vote for him, even if he’s arrested | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040214/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040214/</guid><description>Podcast Description Donald Trump officially launched his campaign to be president again on a stage in Waco, Texas. Despite the likelihood of an imminent arrest and a campaign in disarray he is still, somehow, the frontrunner to face Joe Biden at the 2024 election. So, how can Trump still command the Republican base? Can the party, and America, ever be rid of him?

But recently there’s been another kind of bank run, one that plays out over group chats and email threads involving Silicon Valley billionaires and cryptocurrency investors. The panic among this group of depositors has already led to the collapse of several small and medium-sized banks in the US, and now that anxiety is hitting other banks as well.</description></item><item><title>Why is Australia importing anti-trans activists? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040217/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040217/</guid><description>Podcast Description A speaking tour claiming to quote ‘let women speak’ has been at the centre of disturbing scenes across Australia.

She was given a 15-month prison sentence for her actions — with the magistrate calling her ‘childish&amp;rsquo; and ‘emotional’ during the sentencing.</description></item><item><title>‘Treating private jets like Ubers’: Inside the Hillsong papers | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040222/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040222/</guid><description>Podcast Description A few weeks ago, Independent MP Andrew Wilkie stood up in parliament and dropped a bombshell on the Australian megachurch Hillsong. He tabled a cache of documents that alleged staggering misconduct and outrageous spending at Hillsong, including details of extravagant personal purchases made by some of its leaders, including former global senior pastor Brian Houston, using church money. Now, several days after the speech, we have access to these documents and the potential damage to the church is becoming clearer.</description></item><item><title>Bob Brown on the fight Tanya Plibersek needs to have | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040223/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040223/</guid><description>Podcast Description Bob Brown, the founding leader of The Greens, is ready to make a plea to Tanya Plibersek: stand up in cabinet and be a voice against coal and gas. While the party Brown used to lead is locked in a tense battle with the Labor party over the safeguard mechanism, he believes Tanya Plibersek could become the best environment minister Australia has ever had – she just needs the support of the prime minister.</description></item><item><title>Will Albanese and Dutton agree on the $368 billion question? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040224/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040224/</guid><description>Podcast Description The AUKUS agreement has brought a rare political sight this week: the government and the opposition are agreeing with each other. Both major parties support the deal and if anything they’re competing to show who can support it more strongly. But how will we pay for it? Will we cut spending on other services? Or try to increase tax revenue? Today, columnist for The Saturday Paper Paul Bongiorno, on how $368 billion dollars in spending is inevitably getting political.</description></item><item><title>Why the AUKUS submarines will never arrive | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040225/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040225/</guid><description>Podcast Description The single biggest defence spend in Australian history was announced this week, with the government committing up to $368 billion over the next 30 years to acquire nuclear submarines. Former prime minister Paul Keating has called it “the worst decision by a Labor government in a century”. And big questions remain about whether these subs will ever be delivered at all. So, what could a misstep in the rollout mean for our security as tensions rise between China and the United States?</description></item><item><title>Being John Hughes: Inside literature’s plagiarism scandal | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040226/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040226/</guid><description>Podcast Description John Hughes was once hailed as a young literary genius, and won a scholarship to Cambridge. Yet he found himself back in Australia working as a librarian and a teacher before his writing found acclaim. Hughes was shortlisted for some of the greatest honours in Australian writing. But under the scrutiny of greater acclaim, a strange web of inconsistencies and copying struck one reader: Anna Verney.

With over 100 witnesses and nine weeks of hearings, the commission into one of the greatest failures in the history of the Australian government has already given us unforgettable insight into the thinking of our public servants and leading politicians.

After decades of inaction, the Labor Government has brought their proposal forward, adjusting the awkwardly named safeguard mechanism. But this bets our climate future heavily on emission offsets – or carbon credits. They’re a convoluted way of making up for emissions, by doing good elsewhere. Are they actually a scam?

And, once more, it could all depend on a Labor government negotiating with the Greens. As it stands, they’re at loggerheads. The Greens want no new coal and gas developments to be approved; the government is accusing the Greens of being unrealistic. But should the Greens be expected to pass whatever Labor is proposing? And where’s the science in all of this?</description></item><item><title>How the family court is failing traumatised women | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040231/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040231/</guid><description>Podcast Description The family court is a place of last resort for spouses and parents, to settle the legal, financial and parenting disputes that can sometimes arise. But lawyers and mothers have been warning that when abuse or violence is part of the equation, the court is failing. Today, author and contributor to The Saturday Paper Jane Caro on the women who feel silenced by the family court, and the changes the Federal government now wants to make.</description></item><item><title>It's all about money: Rupert Murdoch's Fox News deposition | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040232/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040232/</guid><description>Podcast Description We now have the clearest insight into the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. The mogul was forced, under oath, to answer questions about Fox News in a $1.6 billion dollar lawsuit against the company. What’s been revealed is that Murdoch and some of his most famous hosts knew they were putting lies to air, and allowed it anyway.

But so far, Australia isn’t recovering from disaster. It’s one year since the Lismore floods, but the scheme to get people back into homes, and to move those homes away from the floodplain, is taking far too long. And in the absence of real recovery, what’s happening in Lismore is being described as “disaster capitalism” – houses on the floodplain are being sold to investors looking for a bargain.</description></item><item><title>ASIO is worried you’re helping foreign spies | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040234/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040234/</guid><description>Podcast Description Our intelligence community used to believe terrorism was the greatest threat to Australians. But today, Australia’s domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, says the biggest threat we’re facing is actually from foreign spies. According to the agency, it’s not just politicians and military officers who are being targeted – it’s everyday people, who might not know they’re giving away information that could cost lives or threaten national security. Today, chief political correspondent for The Saturday Paper Karen Middleton, on why ASIO is worried about Australians getting caught up in dangerous spy games.</description></item><item><title>What convinced Albanese to tackle superannuation | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040235/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040235/</guid><description>Podcast Description A week ago, superannuation reform was just an idea, a national conversation — the prime minister certainly wasn’t proposing anything. But the conversation was brief, and a decision was swift. Australia’s wealthiest people will not get tax breaks on wealth being stored in their super accounts. So what convinced Anthony Albanese that his government had to act? And why was it worth the risk of being accused of breaking a promise?</description></item><item><title>Abortion is legal in Australia, but is it accessible? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040236/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040236/</guid><description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s being called the most important case for reproductive rights in the United States since Roe vs Wade was overturned. A judgement in a court case in Texas that could ban access to a non-surgical abortion medication is due any day now. Closer to home, the exact same medication could become more widely available. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is currently considering appeals to widen its accessibility, with a decision expected in the next few weeks.</description></item><item><title>How corporate profits are making inflation worse | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040237/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040237/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia has seen a series of record corporate profits posted in the last few weeks. They come as millions of average Australians are being squeezed. Mortgage repayments, rent, and the cost of almost everything is going up – but wages aren’t keeping up. So, how are corporations posting record profits right now? What’s the impact of profits on the prices we’re paying? And why is it that the only answer to inflation is interest rate hikes?</description></item><item><title>Exposing robo-debt: Why Rhys Cauzzo’s mother never gave up | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040238/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040238/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rhys Cauzzo was one of hundreds of thousands of Australians who received unlawful and false debt notices under robodebt.

Temporary protection visas allowed people who arrived by boat to come to Australia, but denied them the rights of other visa holders, and hanging over them was the threat that they could be sent back to where they came from. The Labor party promised to put an end to the visas, and now, nine months after the election they’ve finally delivered.</description></item><item><title>Weekend Read: Erin O’Dwyer on how to design housing for happiness | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040240/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040240/</guid><description>Podcast Description As housing becomes less affordable and the search for adequate accommodation more desperate, Erin O’Dwyer investigates how we can escape from the urban sprawl. Erin looks at how the best intentions can go awry, as we try to build better homes. She makes the case that designing our homes doesn’t have to be a luxury and that as we build more and more of them to address the housing shortage, happiness for the people living in them shouldn’t be an afterthought.</description></item><item><title>Superannuation: Is the government breaking a promise? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040241/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040241/</guid><description>Podcast Description For the last 30 years, Australian retirements have been tied to superannuation. It’s the nest egg that most of us spend decades building up. While it might not be a perfect system, any changes to it have usually become stuck in controversy; whether that’s increasing compulsory contributions, or allowing people to raid their super to buy property. This week, the treasurer said he wants to start a national conversation about super – but will it lead to reform, or will this conversation end up in the political graveyard?</description></item><item><title>Balloons attack! | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040242/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040242/</guid><description>Podcast Description Once the United States military started looking for them, they couldn’t stop finding them. Unidentified balloons were everywhere. The military and President Joe Biden decided the best course of action was simple: to shoot these unknown objects out of the sky. But weeks later, we’re finally learning that only the first of these balloons to be shot down has anything to do with China – the others, likely belong to scientists and hobby clubs.</description></item><item><title>Chris Minns' recipe for a vanilla victory | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040243/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040243/</guid><description>Podcast Description In recent years, Labor governments have swept into power in most states across the country… with the exceptions of NSW and Tasmania. But that might be about to change. Chris Minns, the leader of the opposition in NSW, looks likely to lead the Labor party to its first victory in the state since 2007 – but many voters still don’t know much about him. Today, national correspondent for The Saturday Paper Mike Seccombe, on who Chris Minns really is…and why he ditched brashness for caution.</description></item><item><title>What's really happening in Alice Springs | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040244/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040244/</guid><description>Podcast Description Violence and vandalism in Alice Springs became a national fascination this year. First Peter Dutton, then Anthony Albanese flew into town, after rates of alcohol-related assault rose by 68 per cent in 2022. One community meeting, held by a group calling itself ‘Save Alice Springs’, became a focal point of the media’s coverage. But another meeting took place as well. On the edge of town, hundreds of Indigenous leaders and community members came together to discuss the crisis.</description></item><item><title>The day the Reserve Bank got grilled | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040245/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040245/</guid><description>Podcast Description Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has already had to apologise for his forecast that interest rates were unlikely to rise until 2024. He now acknowledges that people may have taken his prediction as an assurance, and as a result they might have bought homes and saddled themselves with debt that’s more expensive than they thought. So, the pressure was on Lowe as he made his way to Canberra last week to answer questions about his decision making.</description></item><item><title>The by-election that will define Dutton’s opposition | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040246/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040246/</guid><description>Podcast Description The announcement that former Liberal minister Alan Tudge will resign from the parliament marks the end of a controversial political career, but it&amp;rsquo;s also throwing open new challenges for the party, and opposition leader Peter Dutton. Speculation is swirling about who will be selected to run for Tudge’s seat in Melbourne at the upcoming by-election, and while the pressure is on for the Liberal party to pick a woman, factional infighting means nothing is guaranteed.</description></item><item><title>Has Rupert Murdoch actually given up on his legacy deal? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040247/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040247/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation is cutting 5% of its jobs around the world, with over a thousand employees in the newspaper business about to be let go.

The WA Premier Mark McGowan said last week: “parents and families need to parent”&amp;hellip; and people shouldn’t point the finger at governments. But his government’s only youth detention facility, Banksia Hill, has unlawfully locked down children for 23 hours a day, thousands of kilometres from family and friends.</description></item><item><title>How the Adani empire keeps critics silenced | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040250/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040250/</guid><description>Podcast Description He’s reportedly the world’s third richest man.

But that’s not how it was for some people who were sent debt notices under therobo-debt scheme – and in at least one case, that information was released after the person had suicided. So who should take responsibility when private data is used to protect an unlawful system? And how do we stop that from happening again?</description></item><item><title>The war on drugs’ worst slaughter is going underground | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040256/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040256/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Australia’s doorstep, one country has taken the global war on drugs to the extreme. When Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines in 2016 he promised to slaughter drug dealers – and his hardline anti-drug regime lasted until last year, when he was beaten in elections. But has the end of Duterte really ended the slaughter? Has the new government lived up to its promises? Or do the bodies in Manila’s morgues tell us the war has gone underground?</description></item><item><title>Thought the climate wars were over?

If you happen to read The Australian newspaper, though, you probably wouldn’t be aware there are two sides to the debate. The Murdoch newspaper has been glowing about Pell’s influence.

If anything, the secret ministries saga has only raised more questions about what drives him, what his values are and who he really is. After years in public life, Scott Morrison can still seem hollow and one-dimensional.

These lobbyists arrange meetings, and make the case why the company they represent would do a good job, why a certain policy would be a good one or a bad one. In short, they represent vested interests. There are supposed to be rules to disclose this activity to the public. But what happens when the rules don’t apply? What happens when the people who are talking to our politicians simply deny that they are lobbyists?</description></item><item><title>15 months in jail after a climate protest | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040296/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040296/</guid><description>Podcast Description Up to 15 months in jail, with a minimum non-parole period of 8 months – that’s the sentence that a climate protester was handed recently in NSW. It caused widespread alarm from human rights and civil liberties groups, and it heralds a new era in sentencing as anti-protest laws are passed around the country. But will this sentence change the tactics of the climate action movement? Or will it open the door to re-examine these new protest laws?</description></item><item><title>Anthony Albanese’s race to get energy prices capped | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040297/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040297/</guid><description>Podcast Description There’s one last thing Anthony Albanese has to do before the end of the political year. Energy prices are still out of control, and they’re only set to get worse. That’s in part because of global pressures, but also because ageing coal-fired power stations are going offline, without enough cheap electricity ready to replace their output. Today, columnist for The Saturday Paper Paul Bongiorno on the race to cap electricity prices before we see more damage to the economy.</description></item><item><title>What happens next for Brittany Higgins? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040298/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040298/</guid><description>Podcast Description The trial of Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins – an accusation he strenuously denies – will not see a court room again, and a verdict will never be reached. It leaves both parties in limbo, and already there is rampant speculation that civil lawsuits could be filed. But the end of the prosecution raises concerning questions about our justice system, the media and who is put at risk when an allegation of sexual assault reaches the inside of a courtroom.</description></item><item><title>Can Tanya Plibersek stop new fossil fuel projects? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040299/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040299/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia has a new, stronger emissions reduction target. But we are also one of the world’s biggest exporters of fossil fuels, and there’s no plan from the government to reduce that. That’s because Australian coal and gas exports that are burned overseas aren&amp;rsquo;t counted in our emissions. But could that change? And will Environment minister Tanya Plibersek begin to consider those emissions and the damage they cause to our climate when new projects are approved?</description></item><item><title>This generation is an existential threat to the Liberal Party | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040300/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040300/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Liberal Party is trying to resurrect its popularity after a devastating loss this year, under the leadership of Scott Morrison. But can changing the personalities at the top of the party make a difference? Or is there something deeper behind the decline in its fortunes? A study published yesterday indicates that only one in four voters under the age of 40 voted for the Coalition – and that seems unlikely to change.</description></item><item><title>‘We exist 365 days a year’ | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040301/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040301/</guid><description>Podcast Description In 1992, the UN General Assembly agreed that 3 December every year would be International Day of People with Disability. It marked an early attempt to treat disability as a human rights and access issue – something that was becoming a movement across the world at the time.

The practice will be made unlawful, with new rules to make appointments public – even Scott Morrison agrees with that. He said as much, when he rose in front of the parliament to explain his actions. But the speech he delivered was hardly an admission of guilt. Today, columnist for The Saturday Paper Paul Bongiorno on what Scott Morrison did when faced with the chance to explain himself.</description></item><item><title>When bureaucrats try to understand human behaviour | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040303/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040303/</guid><description>Podcast Description There are people inside government departments who want to use insights into human behaviour to influence us. At its best, it can help design systems to get the best outcomes for people. But at its worst, it can ‘nudge’ people into accepting bad outcomes; from not appealing decisions to not getting the services they’re entitled to.

Some held blank pieces of paper instead of signs, to protest censorship, others chanted ‘Down with Xi Jinping’. They’re the most significant protests China has seen for 30 years, according to analysts. But how have they happened under the surveillance regime of the state? And what do they mean for the future of the Chinese Communist Party and for Xi Jinping and the China he’s trying to shape?</description></item><item><title>How much Christianity do we need in our military? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040305/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040305/</guid><description>Podcast Description If you don’t believe in God, then heaven help you in the ADF. Those are the words of Senator David Shoebridge, who has argued that our military is putting too much faith in religious chaplains to provide support for service members. The military employs 158 full-time chaplains, 150 of whom are ordained Christian ministers.

The government’s new industrial relations packages promises to make pay more transparent and strengthen the hand of workers in negotiations. But whether this passes, comes down to the decision of one man: David Pocock. His vote has become the most valuable commodity in Canberra. Today, national correspondent for The Saturday Paper Mike Seccombe, takes us inside how David Pocock made his decision to back Industrial Relations reform.</description></item><item><title>A referendum on Dan Andrews: Inside the Victorian election | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040307/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040307/</guid><description>Podcast Description The first major election since a wave of green and teal changed the federal map is set for this Saturday. The Victorian election is about a lot of things, including being a referendum on Dan Andrews and his premiership. But the election could also tell us more about how the electoral forces in Australia are shifting, and how alternatives to the major parties are rising. Today, election analyst and host of The Tally Room podcast Ben Raue on tomorrow’s election, the fate of Dan Andrews and the redrawing of the electoral map.</description></item><item><title>Migrant workers died to bring us this World Cup | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040308/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040308/</guid><description>Podcast Description The World Cup is the most watched sporting event on earth. Some predict that this year’s matches in Qatar could be watched by 5 billion during the month-long tournament. But the grand spectacle of the World Cup is stained with allegations that migrant workers have died to make it happen. So what does it take for the world to look away?

At COP27 in Egypt, measures to tackle damage and loss in countries affected by climate change have been decided upon. But there was also disappointment, largely around the failure to make more ambitious commitments to reduce emissions. The summit also marked a turning point for Australia — a chance for a new government to bring its new targets to the international stage.</description></item><item><title>How Mike Cannon-Brookes staged a climate coup | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040310/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040310/</guid><description>Podcast Description Last week, Mike Cannon-Brookes succeeded in staging what amounts to an internal coup at Australia’s largest climate polluter, AGL.

A Russian network of hackers has put online private medical data including names, records of pregnancy terminations, HIV status, and treatment for drug and alcohol problems. The data was obtained in an attack on Medibank, and the vulnerability of the health insurer has now convinced the Australian government to unleash new capabilities against hackers around the world.</description></item><item><title>Albanese’s meeting with Xi Jinping: Will Australia get a second date? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040312/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040312/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia was one of the first western nations to recognise the communist government of China, almost 50 years ago. But more recently, China appeared to freeze out Australia diplomatically, and for six long years Chinese President Xi Jinping did not meet an Australian prime minister. This week, that changed. But how did the meeting come about? What was said? And can we restore diplomacy while continuing to speak vocally when criticism of the Chinese government is needed?</description></item><item><title>Charlie Teo: The media’s ‘maverick, miracle doctor’ | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040313/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040313/</guid><description>Podcast Description Dr Charlie Teo is known for his incredible brain surgeries, taking on operations that other doctors won’t touch. But several families have come forward, who allege they were misled about the risks and that Teo’s operations left their loved ones worse off than before. Teo denies any wrongdoing, and says he treats his patients like he would want to be treated. But there’s another player in this story that hasn’t been subject to scrutiny: the news media.</description></item><item><title>How not to fund your future leaders, Scott Morrison-style | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040314/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040314/</guid><description>Podcast Description It was the governor-general’s pet project, a foundation that promised to nurture the future leaders of Australia. But the elite foundation never came to be – the new government has axed it. So why did the governor-general put his name to it? Why did Scott Morrison decide to fund it before it was viable? And who was advocating for it? Today, Chief Political Correspondent for The Saturday Paper Karen Middleton on the Australian Future Leaders Foundation and who was courted to support it.</description></item><item><title>Climate justice: Should countries like Australia pay compensation? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040315/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040315/</guid><description>Podcast Description As the world gathers at COP27 to decide on the next steps in our response to the climate crisis, the biggest point of contention is one idea: climate justice. It’s an idea that could force the richest nations – such as Australia – to pay for the damages and loss that climate catastrophe is causing in poorer countries. But could it really happen? Is it viable? And would Australia ever sign up to the idea of climate reparations?</description></item><item><title>Why nuclear submarines can’t save us | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040316/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040316/</guid><description>Podcast Description Australia is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on eight nuclear-powered submarines. It’s estimated to be one of the biggest spends in the history of the Australian government. So why are we buying them? Are they the best use of taxpayer money? And will they even be able to do the job they’re meant to do?

But it may struggle to pass the senate. There’s frustration mounting between crossbenchers, unions and government ministers – and that’s threatening to derail the most important reform package this government has put forward.

But his vision of that public square also involves people paying to be prominent – and the public are not allowed to parody Musk, unless they clearly state they’re making a joke. So what does the chaotic week at Twitter tell us about the world’s richest man, his ideas about speech and how far he’ll go to influence the way we communicate?</description></item><item><title>They were warned, and did it anyway: Inside robo-debt | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040320/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040320/</guid><description>Podcast Description Not long ago, the Australian government was forced to abandon a scheme it was using to pursue welfare recipients for money. The robo-debt scheme was binned in 2019 after the government finally asked the solicitor-general for legal advice. He told them what many had long suspected: it was probably unlawful. So who else knew about the potential illegality of robo-debt? How early did they know? And why did it go ahead at all?</description></item><item><title>​​Could Trump win in 2024?

At stake is control of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Both are on a knife&amp;rsquo;s edge, and major losses for the Democrats could make the next two years of Joe Biden’s presidency incredibly difficult and bring major reform to a standstill.

But the Liberal leader known for tough, hardline conservative talking points is trying to appear more like Australia’s next prime minister – by insisting he has a softer side, and striking a contrast with his predecessor Scott Morrison.

A distressed global economy and rising electricity prices are leaving Labor open to Liberal accusations that they’ve broken an election promise to lower power prices. And: an update on Labor’s industrial relations reforms.

The track is a floodplain, and in prior floods it had become submerged in water. But not this time. This year, a new flood wall protected it. But could the wall that saved Flemington Racecourse have doomed nearby houses?

For consumers looking to sign up for household gas and electricity, it’s hard to know which companies to trust.

The Bureau of Meteorology called on all media to change the name they had used to refer to it: the BoM. Instead it wanted to be called The Bureau.

That idea is a so-called “wellbeing budget”.

Watson has been hailed by some as a hero for his exploits against whaling ships on the high seas — but others say he’s an ‘eco-terrorist’ who has given environmentalism a bad name.</description></item><item><title>Kylie Moore-Gilbert on the Iranian protests | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040336/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040336/</guid><description>Podcast Description The notorious Evin prison in Iran, which holds the Islamic Republic’s political prisoners, was on fire over the weekend.

We know the budget is already in deficit, but services are underfunded and if the government wants to improve childcare, disability care and more, then money will have to come from somewhere. Anthony Albanese has vigorously ruled out dumping the expensive stage three tax cuts.

But this is just the start, as according to the Bureau of Meteorology we could be facing an entire summer of floods and cyclones. As Australia braces for the worsening effects of the climate crisis, experts say we are still too focused on disaster relief and that adapting and preparing communities for disaster is underfunded.</description></item><item><title>Are we on the brink of global recession? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040342/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040342/</guid><description>Podcast Description Yesterday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers offered a grim warning to Australia: we could be on the brink of a global recession. While Australians are already familiar with inflated prices and rising interest rates, the global financial outlook is getting worse. What does it mean for Australians?

During the election, it ruled out raising the rate of unemployment benefits and while in opposition, it offered support to the coalition’s new ‘Workforce Australia’ scheme for the way job services operate.

At the time, the speech was poorly received by the Canberra press gallery and described by some journalists as &amp;ldquo;desperate&amp;rdquo;. But online, it took on a life of its own. Now, what has become known as the misogyny speech can be found on merchandise, in TikTok videos, and is used as shorthand for a particular sense of frustration at sexism in Australian politics.</description></item><item><title>Is Albanese about to axe the stage three tax cuts? | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040345/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040345/</guid><description>Podcast Description They are the tax cuts Scott Morrison promised and Anthony Albanese said he would deliver. If Australia cancels the stage three tax cuts, experts say we could properly fund services like the NDIS and raise unemployment benefits above the poverty line, among other desperately needed measures. If Australia keeps the cuts, some of the wealthiest tax payers will benefit and our tax system will become less progressive.

Even as Russia continued to lose ground in his war in Ukraine, he was defiant; calling the west satanic and making the case for a greater Russian empire. But the most significant thing about what Putin said that day was what it represented: a turn to the ultra-nationalism of the Russian far-right.

Among the most influential in Australia is the Institute of Public Affairs, the IPA, a right-wing think tank that prides itself on being the policy brain of the conservative movement. But the organisation is in decline, it’s generating less new ideas and it’s finding it harder to get the support of business.</description></item><item><title>Reducing good teachers to a single test | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040348/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040348/</guid><description>Podcast Description All of us know that a great teacher can make a huge difference in a person’s life – and a bad one can be a disaster for a young person who’s trying to find their way.

Anthony Albanese has announced Optus should foot the bill for new ID documents and has called the hack a ‘wake up’ for corporate Australia. But why did Optus hold so much data on millions of Australians? Why wasn’t it held more safely? Today, associate professor Toby Murray from the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne - on how millions of Australians are now exposed – and what we need to do about it.</description></item><item><title>‘A shell of a hospital’: opening new facilities without more staff | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040352/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040352/</guid><description>Podcast Description As populations move and grow, communities are in desperate need of more hospitals. But what good is a building without staff? What good is a bed without the nurses and doctors to care for someone in it?

Access to that information is supposed to occur under very controlled circumstances. But there’s evidence that’s not what’s happening. A report has found that police and other agencies routinely break the law in handling private data, and despite warnings - their conduct is getting worse rather than better.</description></item><item><title>Spotlight: A night at the opera — How Whitlam and Kerr fell out | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040356/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040356/</guid><description>Podcast Description After a 10-year legal battle, the “palace letters” were finally released.

It would be easy to assume that with a change of government, and deals with the US and New Zealand to take refugees – that offshore processing was a thing of the past. It’s not, and the Albanese government looks like it is on the verge of signing a multi-million dollar deal to keep detention facilities on Nauru running.</description></item><item><title>The dirty secrets inside one of our biggest casinos | 7am</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5179040358/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5179040358/</guid><description>Podcast Description The very idea of a casino was invented with the involvement of the American mafia.

But it’s not because the value of the properties has risen - in fact values are largely going down. Instead, it has to do with the mortgage repayments of landlords, and the fact there’s not enough supply of rental properties at the moment.
