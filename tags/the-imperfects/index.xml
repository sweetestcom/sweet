        <description>Podcast Description Heads up: Mrs Claus is VERY close friends with comedian, Urzila Carlson. As such, this Special Christmas Episode is definitely not appropriate for kids.
Last year, we were honoured to sit down with the one and only Santa Claus as he joined us in The Vulnerabilitea House. A big thank you to Glenn Robbins for organising that interview for us! Link below if you missed it.
This year, Hugh, Josh and Ryan meet the woman who claims to be the brains behind the operation, Mrs Claus (or is it Ms Claus?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For some people, Christmas Day is the most wonderful time of the year. But for others, catching up with friends and family at this time of the year can lead to pain and sadness and as Dr Emily describes it, an overwhelming feeling of “not-enoughness”. In this special bonus episode, Dr Emily explains where this feeling comes from and why it pops up year after year. But as always she gives us some helpful advice on what we can do to address it and feel a little less alone this Christmas.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Dear Men,
Please listen to this episode about consent and rape culture. Hugh, Ryan &amp;amp; Josh x
On the face of it, this Academy of Imperfection with Chanel Contos may seem like a heavy episode. An episode about consent, rape culture and sexual violence might not seem like an episode that concerns you. That may be true, but if the #MeToo movement taught us anything, it’s that you probably know someone who’s either been raped or sexually assaulted in some way.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3615170003/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Gina Chick grew up… different. She wasn’t like the other kids, and they let her know about it. But as an adult she learned to see her “different” as a strength, which led to her most well-known achievement, outlasting everyone else for 67 days in the Tasmanian wilderness to win ALONE Australia. But as you’ll hear, that’s only a part of her story - as is the fact that she’s very close friends with Hugh Jackman.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As co-host of The Project, Hamish Macdonald has seen and done more than most journalists could ever dream to achieve in their entire career.
Before The Project and a stint hosting ABC’s Q+A program, Hamish worked and reported around the world from war zones to natural disasters, winning a bunch of prestigious awards including a coveted Walkley Award in the process.
But as he discusses with Hugh, Ryan and Josh, he’s also faced bullying throughout his life, whether that be from students during his high school days, or from online trolls during his Q+A days - a challenging experience that drove him to leave social media forever.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We know, we know, we know. ‘Who Do You Desire? is a very click-baity title. But we’re pretty confident that if you DO take the bait (come onnnn), you’ll be nicely rewarded. In this episode, our resident psychologist Dr Emily talks with Hugh, Ryan and Josh about the concept of Mimetic Desire - the idea that whether we like it or not, pure originality is impossible. All of us are being influenced by someone.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Not many of us have won Olympic Gold. And even fewer of us have jumped over a 6m high bar. But Australian pole vaulting champion Steve Hooker has done both. And boy oh boy does he have a story to tell!? That was rhetorical btw, he definitely does have a story to tell.
What would you do if you were the best in the world at something one day, and then the next day you suddenly couldn’t do that thing anymore?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Lewis Hobba grew up idolising Triple J. But despite being chosen as Triple J’s drive-time co-host by the age of 30, and being selected by Andrew Denton as one of Australia’s most creative and talented young performers for the show Hungry Beast, Lewis never felt like he succeeded in anything. In this Vulnerabilitea House, Lewis tells Hugh, Ryan and Josh what it was like behind the scenes for him during this time and how he dealt with crippling anxiety on a daily basis until eventually seeking help.</description>

Tim talks with Hugh, Ryan and Josh about so many different things in this fascinating chat about art and creativity, family, free-will, success, failure and the importance of taking life one level at a time.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3615170013/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description For Jack, it’s progress, not perfection when it comes to his battle with gambling addiction.
This one is a slightly different episode for The Imperfects. Jack isn’t a celebrity, or an expert. But he is a person with imperfections, just like everyone else. And Jack has been kind enough to share his all-too-familiar story with Hugh, Ryan and Josh.
Jack discusses his crippling battle with sports gambling, his experience at rehab, and how he was finally able to escape his life of keeping secrets.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3615170014/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Dr Emily is back - and once again proving why she is increasingly becoming the most popular person on The Imperfects.
This Emisode is all about a fundamental part of Positive Psychology… the beautiful idea that OTHER PEOPLE MATTER.
Now, you’re probably thinking… of course other people matter, right? Seems pretty obvious. But here, Dr Emily explains what it is about ‘other people’, that matters so much, and how much it relates to our never-ending search for that elusive thing we call “happiness”.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3615170015/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description To only say that Brooke Blurton was on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, would not only be a crime to Show Notes, but a huge disservice to you. As Hugh, Ryan and Josh quickly discover, that doesn’t even scratch the surface of what makes Brooke the inspiring, resilient, game-changing, youth-working, breath of fresh air that she is.
While Brooke does touch on her Bachelor and Bachelorette experiences (and why she decided to do it), what makes this Vulnerabilitea House truly special is the story that she vulnerably tells about her upbringing in WA.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Food is such a mystery. Well, I mean, it’s the stuff we eat when we’re hungry, we know that much. But there are so many mysterious things ABOUT food. Like… What actually are healthy foods? What are good fats? Is meat good for you? Is orange juice really that bad? And can food truly be as effective as medicine? Professor Tim Spector has done all the research, written books (link below) and is one of the world’s top 100 most cited scientists.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For 20 years, Osher Günsberg has been one of Australia’s most famous and successful TV/radio/podcast personalities. Since hosting the wildly popular Australian Idol, to handing out roses on The Bachelor (and SO MUCH in between), there aren’t many showbiz stories that rival Osher’s sustained success. But if we’ve learned anything on this podcast, behind every perfect story is an imperfect reality. And as you’ll hear in this honest chat with Hugh, Ryan and Josh, Osher’s journey has been exactly that.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description While our guest might humbly refer to his heroics as “that thing in Thailand”, it was in fact far more significant…
In 2018, the world was gripped by the terrifying story of thirteen boys who were miraculously saved from inside a Thai cave. Maybe you’ve seen one of the billion docos made about it, or the Hollywood film directed by Ron Howard. As you probably already know, the most miraculous part was HOW these boys were saved, thanks in large part to today’s guest, Australian deep-diving anaesthetist, Dr Richard “Harry” Harris.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The phrase, “That’s triggering” or “I’m triggered”, has become more and more common. And while people are triggered by an event, or a topic, or even a scene in a TV show, what does it truly mean to be ‘triggered’? And should we really be avoiding triggering topics, or should we be exposing ourselves to them?
In this extremely helpful episode, Dr Emily goes deep on triggers. She explains to Hugh, Ryan and Josh what it means to actually be ‘triggered’, and how we often use the term incorrectly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Christie Whelan Browne is one of the funniest (and most talented) people in Australia. If you know, you know. She’s won multiple awards and done everything from stage and musical theatre, to TV drama and comedy… and most recently Dancing with the Stars.
But it’s her journey, before the #MeToo movement (and continues today) that’s making the biggest impact. Christie has rarely spoken so openly about her very public and tumultuous experience through the courts, in the media and even within her own family, as she became the face of a high-profile criminal trial and subsequent defamation trial that turned her life upside down.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Laura Henshaw has achieved a lot. Not only is she an author, law graduate and podcaster, but she is the CEO and co-founder of the wildly popular and successful health &amp;amp; fitness app, KIC - which she started and still runs with friend, and former Imperfects guest, Steph Claire-Smith. But behind her success, Laura still worries what people think of her. And in this Vulnerabilitea House, she vulnerably tells Hugh, Ryan and Josh where this comes from and how this anxiety continues to crop up for her in everyday life.</description>

For 46 days in 2022, Nedd ran 100km a day from Cottesloe Beach to Bondi Beach, literally RUNNING ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
Why? That’s the best part. Nedd (23!) not only wanted to raise $1m for homelessness (it’s currently at $2.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you haven&#39;t heard Part 1 of our chat with Lune founder and master-baker, Kate Reid, we recommend you do that first. Because this episode, the sequel in our Croissantology, continues Kate&#39;s miraculous story as she attempts to overcome an eating disorder that forced her to leave her dream career in Formula 1.
Here, Kate explains how she did that by going all in on creating the &#34;perfect&#34; croissant.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Lune is highly regarded as the most respected patisserie in Australia. The New York Times even called the Lune croissant the best in the world. And the woman behind it all is Kate Reid, a former Aerospace Engineer at the Williams F1 Team in the UK.
Kate’s story has to be heard to be believed. It’s so epic, we had to break it into 2 parts.
In Part 1, Kate talks about her time at Williams, and generously shares her struggles with anorexia, which eventually forced her to end her F1 dream and return home to Australia for her recovery.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description 4000 weeks. Like it or not, that’s (approximately) the average length of a human life. And while we intend to use that time wisely, and do all the things we care about, we often find ourselves doing the opposite.
In this episode, UK author Oliver Burkeman tells us how to focus on the things that REALLY matter, rather than filling our time with the not-so-important things. Pulling from his best-selling (and incredible) book, Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management For Mortals, Oliver is this week’s lecturer in The Academy of Imperfection.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After listening to this Academy of Imperfection, you’ll no doubt be heartily agreeing with Hugh, who introduces Dr Kiran Martin as the most impressive person he’s ever met.
Over 30 years after jumping the fence to get inside a slum in Delhi so she could help treat the people in need, Dr Kiran now runs ASHA, an organisation she created that has helped over 900,000 people in over 100 slums across India.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description While many of us may think of Channel 7’s Hamish McLachlan as the voice of sport in Australia, Hamish is very quick to point to Bruce McAvaney instead. As it turns out, we all love Bruce McAvaney A LOT and apologetically talk about him for quite a while - including a few wonderful Bruce stories from Hamish.
When we finally get to the Vulnerabilitea House card selection, Hamish answers the question, ‘When did your life get turned upside down and how did things change?</description>

Afterwards, Hugh explains to Ryan and Josh, how writing a gratitude letter to your Dad (even if he isn&#39;t around anymore) can have a hugely positive impact.
But of course, Gratitude Letters aren&#39;t just for Dads, they&#39;re for your Mum or any carer in your life as well.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This Academy of Imperfection is a little different. As Hugh explains in the opener, this episode actually IS more like a lecture. But trust us, that’s a good thing.
Dr Paul Callaghan has a lot of wisdom to share that he&#39;s accrued over a lifetime of wins, losses and even a near death experience that changed his life forever. As an Aboriginal man, much of Paul&#39;s wisdom has come from his experience on The Dreaming Path, which also happens to be the title of the book he’s co-written with his friend and Aboriginal elder, Uncle Paul Gordon.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Dr Emily is back to help us all!
Reflecting on our episode with Olympic BMX rider, Sam Willoughby from Season 2, Dr Emily talks us through the dangers of the Hedonistic Treadmill, and its slightly lesser known cousin, Hedonistic Adaptation.
There’s a lot covered in this episode, including ‘Growth Mindset’, being mindful of what we want and why, and how quickly we actually adapt to finally getting those things we want.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For over 30 years, Glenn Robbins has been one of the funniest and most loved performers in Australia. From The Comedy Company and Kath &amp;amp; Kim, to The Panel and of course Russell Coight, Glenn has guaranteed his spot in the comedy history books.
But Glenn hasn’t always seen it that way. From a young age he was told he was &#34;average&#34;, and despite his many successes, has dealt with a lifetime of performance anxiety.</description>

But while Lael is technically a therapist who supports parents in understanding their children, everything Lael talks about in this edition of The Academy of Imperfection could easily be applied to all of us in understanding the people in our lives - no matter what age. Whether that be our friends, parents, colleagues or even ourselves.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Harry Garside is an Australian boxer who won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics - the first Olympic medal in boxing for Australia in 33 years. But to simply describe Harry Garside as a champion boxer, would be to sell him waaaaaaay short.
Because Harry is also a ballet dancer, a plumber and the guy who asked to wear a dress at the Olympic Opening Ceremony with the desire of defying gender stereotypes (request denied).</description>

Does that ring any bells for you? Do you choose to live truthfully? Or harmoniously? And what does that even mean? What’s the difference? And how do living ‘truthfully’ or ‘harmoniously’ affect us and the people around us?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Originally from Rwanda, stand-up comedian Oliver Twist spent 14 years in a Malawi refugee camp before finally arriving in Ipswich, Queensland with his family.
In this Vulnerabilitea House, Oliver answers the question, “Where is home for you?” - a simple question for some, but a complicated one for Oliver.
Oliver shares stories from his extraordinarily imperfect life in great detail. Everything from being displaced by the Rwandan Genocide, to living in the refugee camp, and eventually seeing Trevor Noah perform stand-up comedy on the internet.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Okay, so get this...not only is Kemi Nekvapil an author, speaker and coach, but she was trained by Brené Brown. Yuh. THE Brené Brown.
As an author, Kemi has written a new book that you must read. It’s called ‘POWER: A woman’s guide to living and leading without apology’. And in our imperfect opinion, as 3 NON-women, it’s exactly what we all need right now.
In this edition of The Academy of Imperfection, Kemi shares her childhood experience living in foster care - being moved between 5 different families across England - and how it’s shaped her as the powerful woman she is today.</description>

A lot gets covered here, including Luke’s ongoing battles with OCD and why he eventually turned to professional comedy after trying a handful of other careers first.</description>

After what has been a very vulnerable month for The Imperfects, Hugh wanted to check in with Ryan and Josh to see how they’re feeling after some “big shares” in the first 4 episodes of the season.
Firstly, Ryan reflects on how he’s feeling after revealing his worries around the supposed “love triangle” with Hugh and Hamish during Hamish’s Vulnerabilitea House episode. Then Josh talks about his self-doubt surrounding his role on the podcast, and of course where he’s at with his internet use since bravely sharing addiction with the group during the Johann Hari episode.</description>

But luckily there are things we can do about it. If you want to delve deeper into the topics and themes from this episode, please read (or listen to - like Hugh and Ryan did) Johann’s incredible new book, Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention.</description>

Now she’s written her first book, “Ciao, Bella” - filled with stories from her amazing and colourful life. But even with all her success, like all of us, Kate’s life hasn’t been perfect.</description>

There will obviously be a Part 2, and then a few more very VERY special episodes to round out the year.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You may have an image of what a “meditation teacher” sounds like. Whatever you’re thinking of, we’re pretty sure you’re not thinking of Jeff Warren. Jeff Warren is not your traditional meditation “guru”. He’s just... well, a guy. A Canadian guy! And alongside his own challenges with ADD and Bipolar diagnoses (among other things), he’s found a life and successful career in mindfulness and meditation. And if you’re like us, you’ll want to be his best friend.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today we welcome Dr Yves Rees into The Vulnerabilitea House. One morning, in a hotel room in Canada, aged 30, Yves had a life changing epiphany. With this came a range of emotions - happiness, confusion, pain, joy...and almost everything in between.
As well as being a renowned history professor at La Trobe University, Yves is transgender.
In today’s episode of The Imperfects, Ryan, Josh and Hugh are educated and enlightened by the insightful and vulnerable Dr Yves Rees.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On this week&#39;s episode of the podcast we talk to Australian comedian Becky Lucas. Becky has written a book -Acknowledgements, and as you will hear Hugh is BIT of a fan.
We cover a-lot in this ep, from bitchy English exchange students, Becky’s parents&#39; divorce, &#39;dick-lit’, the stresses of lock down; and somehow we manage to squeeze in a discussion of 90s NBL basketball under the ‘auspice’ of a special birthday surprise.</description>

He said he would only ever do it if he found someone extraordinary. In 2015, Hugh found that extraordinary person - Martin Heppell. In today’s episode, Ryan, Hugh and Josh are both moved and inspired as Martin steps into the Vulnerabilitea and shares a heart breaking story from his childhood.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Ready to learn? Us too.
In The Academy of Imperfection this week, imperfect students Hugh, Ryan and Josh speak with American psychologist, leadership coach and specialist in the area of male relationships, Daniel Ellenberg. Daniel shares some very insightful stuff on how men relate to other men - why they do what they do, and why they DON’T do what they don’t do! But by the end of the episode, what was supposed to be a casual “lecture” turns into a men’s workshop of sorts, as Hugh, Ryan and Josh show a lot more vulnerability towards each other than they were expecting.</description>

Lockdown rules meant this teahouse was spread across three tea houses but it doesn&#39;t detract from the quality of the tea, and the vulnerableness. Josh discusses an issue he&#39;s had for a long, long time and Hugh takes some time to delve a little deeper into the concept of vulnerability.</description>

His brilliance on the ground is a direct result of the hard work he puts into his game. What many don’t know however, is that he works just as hard on his mental and emotional health. Due to the tragic passing of his father, Travis has, for way too long, carried the baggage and trauma of this tragedy.</description>
