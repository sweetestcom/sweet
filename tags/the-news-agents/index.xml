        <description>Podcast Description The Far Right are growing in strength, power and number across Europe and beyond. In election after election extremist forces are becoming bigger and bigger players, destroying old more traditional conservative parties. In this episode of The News Agents Investigates, Lewis heads to the Netherlands, where an old political face, Geert Wilders, could now be king of all he surveys. But Holland is just one story, a microcosm of one of the biggest political tales of our time- the slow collapse of the centre and the forces of moderation on the right of politics.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Prince Harry won, the press lost. In a landmark court verdict, a high court judge on Friday ruled that phone hacking and other unlawful practices to obtain stories were &#34;habitual&#34; at the Mirror Group&#39;s newspapers. The judge also said that senior executives at the company knew about these methods, as did Piers Morgan, who once edited the Daily Mirror. Morgan has taken to the airwaves to once again deny.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Vladimir Putin’s “Results of the Year “ was a marathon televised chat show where for 4+ hours he answered none of the questions the Russian public desperately wished they could ask. “When will the war end? When are our soldiers coming home? Are you as ill as the rumours suggest? Why is the Russia on TV not the real Russia?&#34;
Today we ask if Putin’s buoyant mood suggests he thinks he’s about to win the Ukraine war.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The incoming chair of the BBC, Samir Shah, has suggested that Gary Lineker may have breached BBC guidelines with his &#39;ad hominem attacks&#39; on two Conservative MPs. It was only two months ago that the BBC drew up its new social media guidelines - Do they make sense? Does Lineker care? And how much is the corporation responding to pressure from the right wing papers? Later - Mark Drakeford is stepping down as Wales First Minister - and is Rishi out of trouble now after winning last night&#39;s Rwanda vote?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak faces a crucial vote tonight in the Commons over his new Rwanda bill. It&#39;s not proving to be an easy week with his party split over whether the bill goes too far or indeed that it does not go far enough. So just how did the Prime Minister get himself into a position where his whips are scrambling at the last minute to get this vote passed?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An impromptu Prime Minister&#39;s press conference this morning raised more questions than it answered. Rishi Sunak was responding to the resignation of Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick last night - which blindsided the government - and left the PM defending his Rwanda policy and promising he would disapply human rights law to get it through. Today - a stark message for those in the party trying to cause trouble - from Tory backbencher and 1922 committee stalwart Sir Charles Walker - who joins us on the show.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson’s appearance before the Covid Inquiry always had the feeling of the end of season pre-Xmas finale. It began with protests from the bereaved - who Johnson had avoided by arriving early. He offered his apology , insisted the UK death rate had been comparatively normal, and couldn’t quite explain what if anything he thought he’d got wrong. Later- Suella in the Commons. What was that speech about?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Conservative Party has lost half a million voters since their October party conference - according to a brand-new poll of polls. They suggest Rishi&#39;s personal popularity is now lower than... Liz Truss. Why is this happening and is it reversible or terminal? Which political direction will it pull the PM in? And later who is Keir Starmer talking to when he warns Labour will not be making big spending plans - and confesses his admiration for the controversial Margaret Thatcher?</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1156650013/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Matt Hancock has had his moment in the Covid Inquiry&#39;s sun. In characteristic form, he&#39;s been an appropriate mix of quoteworthy, weird and often both. At the heart of his testimony lies some extraordinary allegations. We dig deep.
And in the latest of our extended political interviews, we talk to veteran Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, about her battles with the far right, the far left and how identity politics has brought her own rising sense of Jewishness to the forefront of her politics.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On 15 September 2008 the world changed forever. The collapse of Lehman Brothers Bank heralded the financial crash and the worst recession in 60 years. It would change our politics - perhaps forever. One man predicted the scale and depth of what was to come - the chancellor who fought to stabilise the UK economy on the brink of collapse. That was Alistair Darling, whose death was announced this afternoon.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description With The Telegraph newspaper up for sale we are asking a wider question about who owns our news. Does it matter if foreign parties have a stake ? Does it matter if foreign governments do? And can an owner remain truly impartial when their business depends upon it? We discuss the intersection between politics, newspaper coverage and big money.

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1156650016/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak has cancelled a meeting with the visiting Greek PM. Downing Street says it was because he raised the issue of the return of the Elgin Marbles/Parthenon Sculptures on the BBC, after expressly being asked not to. The Greeks say no such deal was ever made, and they didn&#39;t fancy a downgraded meeting with the Deputy PM Oliver Dowden. Meanwhile Keir Starmer&#39;s team say he had a very productive meeting with Kyriakos Mitsotakis on immigration and security - and they find it odd that a NATO ally was sent home empty handed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Net migration is at an all-time high. Almost three times higher - ironically - than before the Brexit vote. If everyone agrees it’s unsustainable then which parts of it do we want cut? And if migrants are actually plugging vital gaps in our economy then why can’t we say so?
Also today - New Zealand has just U-turned on its smoking ban. Will we stick to ours? And where is Labour now on that 28 billion pounds promised for green spending…</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As Israel and Hamas exchange hostages for prisoners, the worst riots in decades break out on the streets of Dublin (at the egging on of one Conor McGregor) and a far-right, anti-Islam populist wins in the socially liberal, deeply pro-EU Netherlands - what&#39;s happened in the world after a fortnight of all-consuming British political psychodrama.

        <description>Podcast Description The government is running out of chances to change the course of politics. Today’s Autumn Statement was one of them. It was billed by PM Rishi Sunak and Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as a tax-cutting budget, a reward for the tough economic decisions they’d taken earlier. But have they really cut your taxes? And is the economic situation really much improved since they told us there was no room for cutting taxes?</description>

It’s not the Christmas cracker joke answer for some in the Conservative Party who are actively trying to get the PM to do just that. Today, a former Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, spells out the damage that would do.
Later, we ask what the decapitation of Sam Altman at the top of OpenAI tells us.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Jess Philips - one of the 8 frontbenchers who voted against the Labour whip last night - gives her first interview to us since resigning last night from her position as Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding- to &#39;vote with her constituents and her heart&#39;. Will this damage party morale and weaken Keir Starmer? Or will it show a different side to the politics of disagreement? Also, Rishi Sunak is undaunted by yesterday&#39;s excoriating judgmenet from the Supreme Court, making his Rwanda plan unlawful.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Within minutes of the Supreme Court ruling - that the government’s Rwanda scheme was ’unlawful’.
Deputy chairman Lee Anderson was out of the traps saying ministers should ‘go ahead and put planes in the air to Rwanda anyway’. He has a way with words. But 50 other Tory colleagues weren’t that far off the sentiment, urging Rishi to change UK immigration law to make it work. The government was warned - by the Lords - a year ago the whole scheme would be found unlawful.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Who is in charge of cabinet now, with two prime ministers sitting around the table? And are they aligned on domestic, as well as foreign policy? One day after Westminster was knocked off it’s feet by the reshuffle how is the move going down in the rest of the country. And what exactly IS a minister for common sense? Later - those protests, the ceasefire and the Labour vote.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1156650031/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description By 9am this morning, Suella began her own lifestyle choice of homelessness - sacked as Home Secretary. But the big news was still to come. David Cameron emerged from Number 10 Downing Street as both a) the new Foreign Secretary and b) a Lord. This reshuffle has definitely given the Rishi&#39;s cabinet a Pulp Fiction-style adrenalin shot to the heart. But will it put him back in control of the political agenda?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Emily reports from Georgia, the eye of the Donald Trump legal storm, where he was caught on tape trying to get an election official to &#39;find&#39; him more votes to win the 2020 election. A year out from 2024, is this purple state closer to staying blue or turning MAGA red? The latter could tip the election in Trump&#39;s favour. And she heads to South Carolina, to find out about the woman who could well be waiting in the wings in case Trump falls foul of his legal woes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Suella Braverman is (still) the Home Secretary.
That&#39;s despite ongoing calls from within her own party for the Prime Minister to sack her for comments she made about the police and so-called &#39;hate-marches&#39; in an article in The Times, which wasn&#39;t signed off by No.10.
We speak to senior backbench Tory Tim Loughton, author of The New Snobbery David Skelton, as well as More In Common&#39;s Luke Tryl - and we ask who Suella&#39;s extreme politics and language really speaks for.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Suella Braverman is in trouble- again. It&#39;s almost like she invites it.&amp;nbsp;
This time she&#39;s written a piece for The Times which is being slammed as inflammatory. She&#39;s compared the Gaza protests with The Troubles and&amp;nbsp;suggested the police treat right-wing and left-wing protests by different standards, and strongly suggests this Saturday&#39;s should be banned. She has called into question a very old principle, that of police independence from the government.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Fiona Hill is one of the most powerful British people of the 21st century but the chances are you haven’t even heard of her. She’s advised three presidents of the United States on foreign policy, especially on Putin’s Russia. She gave evidence at Trump’s first impeachment. at this time of international chaos, of an America which feels inside and out, on the edge, there could be no better time to talk to this woman with a unique perch on American power, British decline, and how in the end, all roads lead back to the Kremlin.</description>

Also as Nikki Haley pushes into 2nd place in the Republican race to run for president, we are in her home town in South Carolina.

        <description>Podcast Description There are tremors amongst Democrats today - and the makings of a victory lap for Trump fans - after polling one year out from a Presidential election shows the challenge Biden is facing in key swing states. America should know their next president a year today, and in the key state of Georgia we are talking to voters and their politicians about why they’re ready to see Trump back in office.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Did former Health Secretary Matt Hancock think the best person to decide who should live and die during the pandemic was... Matt Hancock? That was the accusation levelled by former NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens in the Covid inquiry. Luckily, the hypothetical situation never materialised but how happy do we feel about politicians playing god? And… as the deputy cabinet secretary describes a Downing Street in which not a day went by without rules being breached, we ask whether it’s time for an amnesty on all those citizens still facing fines and trials?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description How should the police be responding to the government’s call to arrest more people on &#34;hate marches&#34; (sic Suella). Do laws need to change? Do specific chants cross the legal line? And what is the terror threat like over all in the UK right now? We have an extended interview with Met commissioner Sir Mark Rowley on protest, policing and public trust.
In response to Sir Mark&#39;s comments about the Attorney General&#39;s Office, an AGO spokesperson said: &#34;</description>

We also heard from No10 Comms director Lee Cain - his pal - together they paint a picture of the dysfunction that dominated decision making in the early months of Covid. What do the WhatsApp messages really tell us?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Last night - after Israel&#39;s Prime Minister addressed the nation - the troops went into Gaza. It was a raid that paved the way for what Netanyahu promised would be the ground invasion to come. But what is the end game here? And are any of Israel&#39;s allies prepared to try and stop them? We talk to the Economist&#39;s Defence Editor Shashank Joshi about how Israel is preparing for war and what the end game might be.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Labour Muslim MPs have had a long meeting with leader Keir Starmer in which they expressed their discontent with their leader for not explicitly calling on Israel to do more to save civilian life in Gaza. He’s also seen at least 23 councillors step down over their frustration with Labour&#39;s position. Does the Labour leader need to do more to offer reassurance to Muslim voters and MPs? And why is it so problematic to ask for a ceasefire?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Should it be a crime to shout &#34;jihad&#34; on the streets of London during a protest to support Palestinian rights? The Home Secretary had a meeting with Met Commissioner Mark Rowley to ask why the police weren&#39;t prepared to arrest those seeking to incite &#34;violence or hatred&#34; on Britain&#39;s streets. Context is everything of course, and jihad can mean many things. So where does free speech collide with threatening behaviour - when hate crime has risen so sharply since the October 7th Hamas attacks?</description>

They may still win Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire back in next year&#39;s general election, but that doesn&#39;t arrest the growing expectation that there is a distinct possibility the Conservatives could soon face electoral annihilation. We speak to Lara Spirit, editor of The Times&#39; Red Box, to understand the political implications for the Tories and Sunak in the wake of last night&#39;s results.</description>

Rishi like Biden, is walking a fine line. We talk to Shashank Joshi, Defence Editor of The Economist about what&#39;s next as Western leaders scramble in the search for de-escalation.

Or, a failed rocket by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, aimed at Israel, landing accidentally in a hospital car park killing dozens. We are at that inevitable stage of the conflict where truth has become another casualty.
How does Biden - who&#39;s just landed in Israel - attempt to forge a path of peace through such differing narratives?</description>

So will Joe Biden&#39;s visit tomorrow make any difference in the hope for peace in the middle east, and help accelerate a resolution to the current conflict? And will the Rafah crossing open into Egypt to allow for food and medical supplies into Gaza, and for the safe passage of people out?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over the weekend, Palestinian flags flooded central London as thousands marched for &#39;Free Palestine&#39;. But has legitimate support for the rights of Palestinian citizens been merged with more sinister support, or acquiescence of, the presence of Hamas, a deeply illiberal, misogynistic, homophobic and anti-semitic terrorist organisation, in Gaza and the Palestinian territories?
And as Israel starts to evacuate parts of the north of the country - is Hezbollah - the Islamist militant group in Lebanon far stronger than Hamas with equal hate for everything Jewish and Israeli - about to get heavily involved in what could soon become a regional war?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Israeli officials have told Gazan citizens to leave the north and head south ahead of a potential ground invasion - retaliating after a week of war crimes perpetrated by Hamas on Israeli soil. 1.1million people - the number of people roughly in Birmingham, trekking largely on foot, down one of two roads, in the middle of a war. Is that possible? Most think not.
Are many, many thousands of Palestinian civilians about to get caught up in warfare that will see so many lives, on both sides, lost?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are an estimated 150 hostages in Gaza - all ages, all nationalities, some taken from their beds as they slept. How does Israel even begin to contemplate ground war when so many of its people are the other side of that border? And how do you begin to negotiate with terrorists when they&#39;ve broken every rule of war with the sheer evil of their acts? We speak to an expert in hostage negotiation Rachel Briggs OBE.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Keir Starmer was asked live on LBC how far he&#39;d be prepared to see Israel go in response to Hamas.
Would he support a blockade? A siege of Gaza? And that&#39;s where the questions get tough. Israel has the world&#39;s sympathies right now - but no one wants to see this escalated into an existential middle east war. Who is prepared to say so? And later, we talk about the new BBC drama about Jimmy Savile and &#34;</description>

If Sir Keir Starmer was looking for a bit of sparkle today in his Leader&#39;s speech he shouldn’t have worried: it came to find him in the shape of a glitter-throwing protestor before he’d had the chance to say a word.
Undeterred, he took to shirt sleeves and spelled out a working class mantra of aspiration and renewal for a country on its knees.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the biggest story of the past week - a flagship, important, party conference week for the Prime Minister, he announced the scrapping of the biggest infrastructure project in Britain in a decade. A project that many saw key to levelling up the north of the country. But, is &#39;scrapping&#39; it even that easy, that possible? And what&#39;s to say what they&#39;ve promised in its place will come to fruition?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Tory conference is over, but the next one - Labour - looms large. What will Sir Keir Starmer do with the new look rail plans? Will they resurrect HS2 or get into line behind Sunak&#39;s plans? And whilst the mood of the country may demand change, how confident is Labour or bringing them on side?

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak was on his feet in a speech that was frankly too long. It ripped up HS2 and replaced it with a nebulous Northern Network pledge. It promised to rethink A levels and ban young people from smoking. There was nothing on housing, energy, social care , the environment - it felt, indeed, like the end of the road. Has he convinced anyone he is the future ?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The News Agents at the Conservative Party Conference: Day 2
What does Conservatism look like in 2023? At their party conference in Manchester this year, the right of the party are being very vocal about redefining how their party looks. We hear from the politican whose drawn the biggest crowds at the event this year... not a government monster but former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage.
And the PM still hasn&#39;t announced his decision on the northern leg of HS2 - we talk to West Midlands Mayor Andy Street about his campaign to keep the train line going north of Birmingham.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The News Agents at the Conservative Party Conference: Day 1
The queue to see the former PM stretched right the way through the Midland Hotel in Manchester. And it wasn’t to see her apologise for the chaos she caused to the economy a year ago. No, these are die hard Trussites. They love her, hate taxes and want to rip up regulation. She’s the most popular politician here - and that’s a headache for the PM who still hasn’t got his lines straight on major policy announcements that appear utterly muddled.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Michael Heseltine is a politician with a long political memory. He heard Neville Chamberlain declare war on Germany in 1939. He saw Suez unfold. He attended Churchill’s funeral. He’s served Conservative prime minister after Conservative prime minister and became the man who eventually even brought down Margaret Thatcher. He never reached the highest office himself, but having seen so many who did up close, and witnessed so much of Britain’s political journey over the last century, there can be few who can offer more perspective, more wisdom about the state we are in and where we might yet go, than he.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak has refused to answer whether his government is set to scrap the Northern leg of HS2 between Birmingham and Manchester.
The indecision is already creating division within the Conservative Party ahead of the party conference next week. So today we ask whether Rishi Sunak really cares about the north of England.
And we look at the latest &#34;flip-flop&#34; from Labour leader Keir Starmer.

        <description>Podcast Description Laurence Fox&#39;s weird sexist rant last night on GB News got short shrift from the organisation which immediately suspended him from the platform, and followed on later by suspending their presenter, Dan Wootton.
But GB news has still got plenty of presenters on its books who spout conspiracy, confect outrage, and misinform. This didnt come from nowhere - so why is everyone suddenly arguing this is a turning point for the fledgling broadcaster?</description>

She says the numbers of people crossing the channel now make it unsustainable. Is she right? And where are her numbers coming from.</description>

Plans for HS2 are in chaos after rumours the PM might be about to ditch the wildly over-budget rail project. He&#39;s called environmental policies heavy handed - and ditched some of those targets. And now his ministers are starting to suggest that inheritance tax could be &#39;deeply punitive&#39;.</description>

But in an age where Brand can reach 6.5 million subscribers and sell out Wembley, does any of this stuff really hurt him? Also today, we hear from the son of Jimmy Lai - the world&#39;s richest political prisoner -and British citizen - who has stood up for Democracy against Chinese dictators.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description **CW: This podcast includes discussions of rape and sexual assault**
This weekend saw the culmination of an extraordinary piece of investigative journalism that began four years ago. In 2019 Russell Brand - now accused of rape and sexual assault by women featured in the Sunday Times and Dispatches investigation - began a path of reinvention as a “ wellness guru “, eschewing main stream media platforms for a YouTube following of over six million.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There is no money left.
The reason Britain can afford less and less is apparently because we have no money. It&#39;s why we can&#39;t spend on schools, on hospitals, on defence. But what if it&#39;s not actually about scarcity at all?
Today, Lewis reimagines our state&#39;s finances and argues why we need to talk about wealth.
And - it&#39;s the first time in US history that a sitting President&#39;s child has been criminally prosecuted.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description BREAKING NEWS: Rishi Sunak’s SpAd has hit back at Keir Starmer&#39;s ‘Inaction Man‘ gag and called him - wait for it - a ‘man of action’. But first, Labour is voting against the government’s bill to build more new homes. Why? Because the Tories say they would rip up old EU environmental regulation to get morew homes built. Do we really have to choose between the two? Conservatives argue the ‘nutrient neutral ‘ regulations are out dated.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &#34;The battle for the General Election is getting started&#34; - that was the message from Labour&#39;s Deputy Leader today. Angela Rayner made also a promise to change anti-strike laws within the first 100 days of a Labour government, in her speech to the TUC.
So on the day that Labour gets serious about the next election, Emily hears from Labour&#39;s Peter Kyle - the new Shadow Minister for Science, Innovation and Technology.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description *CW: This episode contains discussions about suicide* More than a hundred of you - our listeners - have been in touch to share your own experiences with mental health care (or lack of it) in this country. Collectively, you paint a picture of a system in crisis, a pandemic particularly amongst the young which we cannot deal with. We hear from Roman Kemp - who&#39;s called on the government to put mental health provision in all our schools.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description David Lammy, the next Foreign Secretary?
This felt like the week when Labour really began to be treated as a government-in-waiting. One area which has barely been considered is how the party will handle foreign policy, Britain’s place on the world stage. David Lammy, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, talks to Lewis at length about what he wants to do if he gets that top job and his political journey.</description>

Daniel Khalife - as we record - is still on the run. So where has he gone, how did he do it and what are the implications of the whole saga?

        <description>Podcast Description Could Suella&#39;s new Illegal Immigration Act be about to backfire horribly on the Home Office? Over the last year, money to house asylum seekers has come from the Department for International Aid. It&#39;s taken nearly 30 percent of their budget or just over £3.7billion. But the introduction of the new law - which criminalises asylum seekers - means that the government is no longer allowed under OECD rules to spend Aid money on them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A government poster warning us &#34;MOST SCHOOLS ARE UNAFFECTED&#34; by lethal crumbling concrete may not offer the reassurance the Department for Education is aiming for. Indeed it was a gift to Labour - whose comms department instantly retorted with &#34;Most swimmers not at risk of sharks&#34;. So what has happened to capital spending on schools since the Conservatives came to power? And what on earth is going on inside Number 10?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The blame for the school concrete scandal has landed right at the Prime Minister&#39;s feet - after a former civil servant from the Department for Education revealed it was Chancellor Sunak that cut the funding for rebuilding schools five years ago. But it&#39;s his Education Secretary - Gillian Keegan - who&#39;s conducting the political heat today after a sweary off-mic rant which she is almost certainly now regretting. In fact she gave a subsequent apology ON mic.</description>

From election nights, to iconic political panel shows, to huge Royal occasions - he&#39;s been at the forefront of TV and radio news and politics for decades.

Claire Coutinho becomes the new Energy Security Secretary. But does this do anything to help arrest the Conservatives&#39; seemingly-inevitable slide toward electoral defeat next year (if the polls are to be believed). We ask Lara Spirit, of The Times.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Donald Trump has been indicted&amp;nbsp;again.&amp;nbsp;But this time, it was the full works, including obligatory mugshot. This mugshot, of a scowling, glowering Trump appeared all over social media, at Trump&#39;s own hand, as he returned to Twitter (currently ridiculously known as X) to urge his followers to &#34;NEVER SURRENDER!&#34;
Jon makes an unusual appearance on a Friday, but couldn&#39;t resist it in the wake of the legal nightmare the US now finds itself inhabiting.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Yevgeny Prigozhin is apparently dead, two months after he marched the Wagner mercenary group to Moscow in a mutiny that appeared to be a very embarrassing weekend for Vladimir Putin.
Yesterday, a private plane crash also killed nine others, including his right hand man, the co-founder of the Wagner group, Dmitry Utkin.
So what actually happened? Was it an act of revenge from Putin? And is he now stronger than ever?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s 75 days since Nadine Dorries announced she was standing down as an MP with &#34;immediate effect&#34;... but she&#39;s still the MP for Mid Bedfordshire and getting paid for it.
Since announcing she&#39;d go in June, Dorries has received calls to go from local councils, politicians and even the Prime Minister. She&#39;s also been criticised for effectively going missing. So what has she been up to? And tonight is a big night in American politics - it&#39;s the first debate to choose the Republican candidate for the 2024 election and one very familiar face won&#39;t be there.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mason Greenwood won&#39;t play for Manchester United again. Greenwood was one of the most exciting talents in world football two years ago, before he was arrested and charged for attempted rape, coercive control and assault. The charges were dropped by the CPS in February this year.
The final decision on Greenwood&#39;s place at the club was announced yesterday, with a &#34;mutual deicison&#34; that he will be leaving. But just last week, there were rumours of a plan to bring the player back.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Lucy Letby has been given a whole life order for her crimes. She joins only a small group of prisoners to be given a sentence so severe that they can never be considered for parole. But she wasn&#39;t in court today to hear it for herself. She chose not to appear, much to the victims&#39; families fury. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition want the law to be changed to force criminals to face their days of reckoning in person.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Covid is back&amp;nbsp;in the news - there is a new&amp;nbsp;mutation of Omicron which is potentially more infectious than the last. Some are sounding the alarm. We talk about whether you should be worried (spoiler -probably not). But while it&#39;s in the news we thought we&#39;d examine a question long lurking at the sidelines of the Covid news story - where did it come from? Is the lab leak theory increasingly credible?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s A-level results day and the message from the Education Secretary is to urge students not to worry too much about the results, that no-one will ask about them in 10 years&#39; time.
The PM has also said that there are plenty of other options available to those who didn&#39;t get the grades they need. But is this really the message for ministers to send to kids who have been studying for these things for years?</description>

But with the highest paid footballer in the equivalent of the Premier League paid less in a year than some male players get in a week, will this prove a watershed moment in attempts by many to push for greater financial parity? We speak to Kieran Maguire, football economist.
And back in the world of Westminster - what does falling inflation mean?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Generation screwed. A hoard of students tens of thousands of pounds in debt, but with nothing to show for it. We speak to students who&#39;ve been affected and hear from the university and college union boss, Jo Grady- who backs the striking staff.
And, the Tory internecine warfare continues after a shambolic selection process to pick their candidate for London mayor. But do they still have a pathway to win next year&#39;s election with Trump-fan Susan Hall if Jeremy Corbyn throws his hat in the ring?</description>

        <title>Will Rishi Sunak now tell Lee Anderson to &#34;f*** off&#34;? | The News Agents</title>

        <description>Podcast Description Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party Lee Anderson went on TV last night and openly admitted that his own party are failing to &#39;stop the boats&#39;. That&#39;s the same party that announced at the start of this year that one of their five priorities was to ... stop the boats. Anderson has always been a law unto himself, and sometimes this has worked to Rishi Sunak&#39;s benefit. But is he now becoming a serious problem for the Tories as they try to build their case for re-election next year?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Andrew Malkinson was convicted of rape in 2003 and it took nearly two decades for this miscarriage of justice to be corrected. But it could have happened much earlier, were it not for the police repeatedly bungling the case, or perhaps worse. Andrew joins Jon and Lewis for an extended conversation about his time in jail, what the police did wrong and what it tells us about the justice system itself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s &#34;small boats week&#34; on the government media grid; or that was the idea.
It looks like it could have been over before it began. Jon is back, and with Lewis they chew over why the government keeps pointing to a policy area on which it&#39;s failed. They also talk through the Home Secretary&#39;s latest great idea as to where to house up to 500 asylum seekers. The Bibby Stockholm, a huge barge currently moored off the Isle of Portland.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Donald Trump was indicted for a third time this week and a fourth is on the way. He emerged from a DC courthouse this week actually inviting more - he thinks it&#39;s helping him, feeding into a long-established persecution complex which he feels will been a key asset in his bid to be re-elected.
In this episode, we ask a simple question: is he right? And is he right everywhere?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak isn’t much good at interviews. Sir Keir Starmer isn’t that much better. It follows a pattern of politicians become less and less willing to take part in political interviews, which they see as increasingly pointless, all risk and no gain. We ask, does it matter? And why does our democracy lose, as a result?
And interest rates rose for again- now at a 15 year high. Torsten Bell joins Lewis to explain where it leaves households and Rishi Sunak’s re-election chances.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Donald Trump has been indicted. Again. But this is the most serious of the lot - a series of conspiracies against the republic itself and an attempt to subvert an election. Emily and Lewis talk what it means for America, Trump and 2024. Jon got bored on holiday and couldn’t resist popping up either.
We speak to Trump&#39;s former Deputy Press Secretary, Hogan Gidley.

        <description>Podcast Description House prices have fallen an average of 4% in the last year due to rising interest rates and the knock on effect on mortgages. How low will they go and does anyone think we&#39;re on the cusp of a housing crash? We ask esteemed economist Roger Bootle.
Also - we’re in Ukraine which has been hitting back - drone attacks on Russian apartment blocks in Moscow. Putin calls it “terrorism“.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak is handing out around one hundred new oil and gas licences for North Sea drilling and says it is entirely consistent with his plans for net-zero. But his former energy minister has said the government is &#39;on the wrong side of history&#39;. Can you get to clean energy by going back for more fossil fuels? Will voters thank him at the ballot box if he can make the transition less painful?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Mayor for Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, says he is a &#34;place first&#34; not a &#34;policy first&#34; politician.
In a week where the Greater Manchester Police have been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, Lewis travels to Manchester to meet the Mayor and ask him whether he has confidence in the force.
In today&#39;s The News Agents, we talk about his relationship with Keir Starmer and the central Labour party, the potential Qatari takeover of Manchester United and the Mayor&#39;s political ambitions going forward.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Andrew Malkinson spent 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Yesterday the Court of Appeal finally cleared his name. It is a failure so serious, so unthinkable it barely makes sense. But today Mr Malkinson laid the blame firmly at the door of the police who- he says- concealed and destroyed evidence to mask their mistake. Why isn&#39;t this a crime? And what should happen now?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Labour have promised to simplify and reform the Gender Recognition Act that helps trans people officially change their gender identity. Self ID will NOT be Labour policy - you will still need a medical assessment to transition. And they are drawing clear lines between sex and gender. Will this help politicians answer the toxic question of whether a woman can have a penis? And what does it tell us about Labour&#39;s direction of electoral travel?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The pictures from Greece tell a horrifying story of people running for their lives from the wildfires. Southern Europe is locked in unprecedented heatwaves across the continent. But the headlines tell a different story - of our two main parties starting to shift the narrative about net-zero policy - after what seems like a singular By-election upset in Uxbridge. The British public - according to recent YouGov polls - are firmly behind green policies - as long as it doesn&#39;t personally hurt too much.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1156650128/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Three by-elections and a win each for the three main parties. Labour won with the biggest electoral swing in their history in Selby and Ainsty, the Lib Dems won a huge majority in Somerton and Frome and the Conservatives just about held their seat in Uxbridge.
On the surface, the set of results are better than what the Tories had anticipated. But, better than terrible can still be pretty bad.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What is really up with Nigel Farage&#39;s bank account? We discuss, and hear from the man at the centre of what&#39;s quickly become a national banking storm. And Defence Committee Chair and senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood published a video earlier this week extolling the virtues of Afghanistan. Sort of forgetting that the country is led by the murderous Taliban regime. He now faces a no confidence vote. Why on earth did he do that?</description>

Will the backlash over child benefits harm Keir Starmer? Or will none of it make any difference? Has the county already found an inflection point where it&#39;s looking for change?

        <description>Podcast Description What&#39;s happening to Keir Starmer&#39;s policies? Yesterday he ditched another one, confirming that he would maintain the Conservative austerity policy that saw child benefit scrapped after two children.
Cue major backlash - and today a resignation from a Labour mayor (famously no fan of Starmer) citing too many broken promises from the leader. Meanwhile, Keir is warming to his theme of fiscal prudence. Is it enough to convince people that Labour has a fresh promise?</description>

His life story - which includes Christine Keeler, finding his feet at Cambridge and coming out as gay - is something he&#39;s kept relatively quiet about until the publication of his memoir: One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry Up.</description>

In an emotional statement, his wife revealed he was in hospital and in a bad way. The Sun decided not to print further allegations. The BBC&#39;s own news teams went ahead with new breaking stories.

I love the whooshing sound they make when they go by.&#39; Monday 4pm was the cut off for Boris Johnson to hand over his phone and Whatsapp messages to the Covid Inquiry. 48 hours later that phone still hasn&#39;t reached its end destination. Johnson says he&#39;s cooperating. The phone is with his lawyers. But the inquiry is waiting... Meanwhile the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has delivered a shot across the bows to his old boss accusing those who criticise the civil service of &#39;self-defeating cowardice&#39;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The front pages proclaim just one story in town: the sex photos that were allegedly sold by an underage crack addict to a top BBC presenter. But look a little deeper, and there may be more to this story than meets the eye. What do we know about the money that&#39;s changed hands? What does it tell us about the relationship between The Sun newspaper and the BBC? And where is the line between privacy and transparency?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mark Zuckerberg launched his new platform, Threads, this week. It&#39;s designed to knock Twitter - owned Elon Musk - off of its perch. This story is a parable of our age. Men of unbelievable wealth and unbelievable power locking battle. Whoever wins, if anyone wins, it will have reverberations on our culture, on our politics, on the tapestry of our lives. And Lewis also talks to the SNP leader for Westminster, Stephen Flynn MP, about his political make-up.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The prospect of another by-election looms after Parliament&#39;s standards committee recommended an eight-week suspension of former Conservative whip, Chris Pincher.
If the name is familiar, it’s because he was arguably the one who sealed the fate of Boris Johnson and led ultimately to his resignation. Today we discuss the ramifications of the sexual assault and we look at Keir Starmer&#39;s pledge to give working class kids better oracy skills.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Exclusive footage of Boris Johnson from the One Decision Podcast has been shared with The News Agents. He was facing questions from hosts Julia Macfarlane and Richard Dearlove about Ukraine, democracy and global security. Towards the end, Julia asked him about his own response to British democracy - his refusal to accept the findings of the &#39;kangaroo court&#39; privileges committee into his wrongdoing. She also asked him about Chris Pincher - the deputy chief whip who resigned from government over sexual assault allegations - and that&#39;s where Johnson&#39;s answers got really odd.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The SNP&#39;s deputy leader in Westminster, Mhairi Black MP, joins us exclusively in News Agents HQ to announce she&#39;s stepping down at the next election.
We discuss the &#34;toxic&#34; culture that&#39;s led to Black - the youngest MP in 350 years when she was elected in 2015 - to leave parliament, and we ask why so many other MPs won&#39;t be standing again.

        <description>Podcast Description If you landed in this country and wondered what its problems were you might see the long queues for the health services, the high inflation, the shortage of workers to fill public sector jobs and the difficulties the country has with its supply chains. The New Conservatives are a new fringe Conservative group trying to solve a different problem. They think we need to cut immigration numbers by 400k, stop foreign workers visas, and offer the jobs (that we can&#39;t currently fill) to British workers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak and now former government minister Lord Zac Goldsmith have a war of words over why Goldsmith resigned this morning. Sunak says its because of the latest Privileges Committee report. Goldsmith says it&#39;s because Sunak and his government are not serious about climate change. It comes in a week where it&#39;s been announced that this June has been the hottest ever, and the head of the Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, questions how serious the Conservative government are about sticking to net zero policies.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As we record, the government is on standby in case Thames Water collapses. The country&#39;s largest water company has £14billion of debt, and is rudderless after the exit of their chief executive. It&#39;s prompting many to ask questions about privitisation more widely. How did bills get so high, as quality got so bad? That&#39;s before you even get on to the shit in the sea. We ask what we&#39;ve learnt about taking essential industries out of public control.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Matt Hancock appeared before the Covid inquiry to offer a profound apology. He threw the government pandemic strategy under a bus with his assessment that the covid strategy had been “completely wrong“. Two years ago our gratitude to health workers knew no bounds. This week the harsh reality set in: as the PM confirmed he wouldn’t be able to meet the public pay review recommendations for wage rises. What does that say about our relationship with the NHS?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On Saturday morning it looked like we might see the collapse of one of the world&#39;s longest standing dictators, Vladimir Putin. By Monday things were suspiciously calm, and the uprising against him - by his own former chef - was being flat out denied. So what just happened in Russia? Was it the start of a revolution? Or a massive mistake? Will this weaken Putin&#39;s grip or strengthen his hand?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week, the world has been captivated ( and wrapped up in hope) by the tragedy of the five people who&#39;ve died in an attempt to visit the wreck of the Titanic.
Jon sits in for Lewis this week and asks whether extreme tourism is going too far - whether we should push the boundaries of exploration (even if at potential great cost to others) and why the public; and the media, have been transfixed by the story.</description>

Why are we struggling so much more than other countries to bring down inflation?
And what will the political ramifications to all this be - will it make it easier for Labour to win an election - or will people rally to their government at a time of crisis and prefer the devil they know, to the devil they don&#39;t?</description>

But 235 of his colleagues abstained from it all together. Why was this so hard for the governing party? What does this tell us about the relationship between Rishi Sunak and his predecessor? And why was Theresa May the only former PM to make the case for its importance? We also ask the Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley how many criminals he believes are still working within the police force - and what he&#39;s doing about it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson has dominated the headlines this week. But, peek behind the bluster and noise, and the country has far bigger fish to fry. The question is whether Rishi Sunak&#39;s government, his five point plan, is more sashimi than seared. Boris Johnson distracts everybody. He&#39;s hard to avoid. But there&#39;s a cost- we ignore what is really driving our politics and voters. The truth is, when you dig down into the problems Rishi Sunak himself identified, many are worsening.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson repeatedly knowingly misled the House of Commons, in other words he repeatedly lied.
These are the conclusions and findings of Parliament&#39;s Privileges Committee, established unanimously by MPs to investigate claims Johnson knowingly misled&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;over partygate,&amp;nbsp;thereby breaking rule&amp;nbsp;no 1 of the British&amp;nbsp;constitution: never *ever*&amp;nbsp;lie to the Commons.
It&#39;s a huge political day and although Johnson has already fled Parliament by resigning, the consequences are still massive. Johnson wanted his place in the history books, in becoming the first PM to be found to&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;lied to the Commons, judged by his own peers, he&#39;s finally got it.</description>

It means some of his closest aides throughout the partygate scandal will sit in the House of Lords for life, and his list also honours former cabinet ministers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel.
Just minutes before the list came out, Nadine Dorries - the former culture secretary and a close ally of Boris Johnson - quit as an MP with immediate effect, triggering a by-election in her Mid-Bedfordshire seat, hours after she said on TV that she didn&#39;t want that.</description>

In 2018, as per The Mirror, ﻿when Rishi Sunak was just an MP - the family donated more than 3 million dollars to a private tech college in California - previously attended by his wife.
Fast forward to 2023 where a primary school in his constituency has spent nearly a year fundraising to find 10k to buy school kids computers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson has, finally, and perhaps reluctantly, handed over a ton of WhatsApp messages between him and others while he was PM at the height of the Covid pandemic. But what will the Cabinet Office do with him, and what does this mean for Johnson, Sunak and the Conservative Party?
And, we talk to a spokesperson and member of Just Stop Oil. When do the ends justify the means when it comes to civil disobedience?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Keir Starmer&#39;s column on Wednesday morning in right-wing tabloid newspaper The Express is another step in the Labour leader&#39;s transformation from all guns blazing Remainer to born again Brexiteer. But he&#39;s not the first Labour leader to turn to the right-leaning press to prove his prime ministerial credentials as the next general election draws ever closer.
What does this mean for Labour and where does this leave Britain&#39;s place in the world, and its relationship with Europe if Labour are the next government in power?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It started with a tabloid story that a male and female presenter on daytime TV were no longer getting on. Big deal. It was accompanied by darker rumours about Philip Schofield, a fixture on television for decades. And then the wisps of smoke on a hillside became a full scale wildfire, tearing through ITV. His relationship with a much younger man have now turned this into a daytime chat show into peak time drama, and questions are now growing for ITV senior management.</description>

This one involved not a rocket but a presidential candidate - who thinks he can beat Donald Trump. If that was ever true, it feels much more unlikely today after the campaign launch went up in flames.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Does it matter if Boris Johnson broke more Covid rules by inviting guests to his country home, Chequers, when the rest of the country was in lockdown? His former advisor Guto Harri says it&#39;s time to get over it. There are more important things to discuss. But we&#39;re not so sure the country is quite so ready to forgive and move on. What does it say about the country in which we live, if rules no longer count and if the civil servants who report wrongdoing are threatened with legal action?</description>

It&#39;s a success story for the club, team and fans - but it&#39;s all been helped by new money from their Saudi backers. Today we look at a future of football as nation states - securing victories on the pitch, battling geopolitics off it.

        <description>Podcast Description Did Home Secretary Suella Braverman break the ministerial code by asking civil servants to help her avoid a public speed awareness course?
She insists there&#39;s nothing to see here - she&#39;s taken the points on her licence and wants to move on. Her allies insist she&#39;s the victim of a smear campaign by those who don&#39;t like her immigration policies. But today on the News Agents we talk to former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland who asks what she was doing at the National Conservatism conference, and whether she is committed to &#39;collective cabinet responsibility&#39; - a subtle dig at her own prime ministerial ambitions perhaps?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Tom Parker Bowles is a food writer and critic with strong views on coronation chicken, UK farming and... of course, quiche. His mum is about to be crowned Queen - so today we chat about the monarchy, the dos and don&#39;ts of royal food, protest and a certain Harry. And we chat through the political ramifications of Rishi Sunak&#39;s response to the bullying inquiry into Dominic Raab.

        <description>Podcast Description This is your midweek episode of Succession. Because Rupert Murdoch - aka Logan Roy - has shelled out nearly 800 million dollars to settle a defamation suit brought by Dominion - a company that makes voting machines. Fox News had tried to claim the voting machines manipulated the result of the 2020 presidential election to make Trump lose. Which was clearly bollocks. Late last night, Fox settled out of court - to make the trial of the century go away.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Another high profile arrest in the SNP. This time, Party Treasurer Colin Beattie - who was called in for questioning in the inquiry into party finances - specifically the concerns over £600,000 raised by supporters to fund a second independence referendum. It&#39;s been a rocky few weeks since Sturgeon announced her resignation in February. The arrest of her husband and Chief Executive of the SNP, the blue evidence tent in their garden, the removal of a camper van from the in-laws in Dunfermline, leaked conversations that surfaced two years ago and now the second arrest.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Animal Rights Protestors are being blamed for the death of a racehorse at the Grand National this weekend after they forced a delay which - trainers say - agitated the animals. Animal Rising - the protestors - say: Don&#39;t blame us - horses are dying on racecourses; with or without the delays. But they&#39;re delighted we&#39;re now having a conversation about animal cruelty, sport and what happens to thoroughbred horses if racing stops.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you thought the overturning of Roe v Wade- the constitutional right to an abortion in the United States was the end of it in 2022, then 2023 has other ideas. Or rather the radical, anti-abortion groups in the United States have other ideas. Just this week, Florida’s Governor (and presidential hopeful) Republican Ron DeSantis introduced a six week abortion ban in the third biggest state in the country.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description China&#39;s President Xi Jinping has told his troops they should be ready for real combat. So now we are wondering if Taiwan will be the next Ukraine. It comes after a week of China sabre-rattling in the Taiwan straits - surrounding the island on all sides with a blockade. France&#39;s President Macron is just back from Beijing where he&#39;s set the cat amongst the pigeon&#39;s with some ill-judged comments about Taiwan.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We&#39;ve been told off-record that Joe Biden might be Irish. Obviously, unattributable. So keep it under your hat. He&#39;s the latest in a long line of US Presidents who feels the pull of the Emerald Isle very strongly and traces his ancestry back there by 180 years. But he begins the day in Belfast - reflecting on the Good Friday peace accord 25 years ago. But can he get power-sharing back on track?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Labour’s Easter weekend attack ads about the Conservatives and Rishi Sunak specifically have been called &#39;politics of the gutter&#39; by, awkwardly, Labour’s former Home Secretary David Blunkett. Lewis is joined by Steve Reed, the party’s Shadow Justice Secretary, who was behind the campaign. He, as you’ll hear is entirely unapologetic. Is this the start of a new period of a more vicious politics? And NHS surgeons may be about to face their own #MeToo moment, with female surgeons coming forward to say that sexual assault and misogyny within surgery is commonplace.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are two questions that accompany any political scandal. What did you know and when did you know it? After questioning Nicola Sturgeon&#39;s husband Peter Murrell for eleven hours yesterday, police are back at their Glasgow house, and there&#39;s still a blue evidence tent in the garden. It comes just a week after the leadership election of new SNP First Minister Humza Yousaf, seen as the Sturgeon succession candidate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When we left you Trump was on the cusp of entering the Manhattan criminal court as an arrested man. That didn&#39;t go well.
A door was flung shut in his face. And the indignities began. In this special all-nighter episode of The News Agents we take you through the charges against him, the reaction, the defence and the speech to his supporters in Mar-a-Lago. We speak to a key member of Trump&#39;s campaign team who was with him in the wings moments before he went on stage.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Donald Trump will today become the first US president to appear in court on criminal charges. He arrived in NYC late yesterday and will shortly be heading to Lower Manhattan District Court to have his fingerprints taken and hear the 34 charges of improper business dealings being levelled against him. Will the criminal charges stack up? Will Trump keep his cool? And will his supporters take to the streets in protest?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak has pledged to end the &#39;political correctness&#39; that stops police arresting child sex abusers from ethnic minority backgrounds. The scandals of Rotherham, Rochdale, Telford show how badly things can go wrong for victims when the perpetrators are seen to be beyond the law. But Labour&#39;s West Yorkshire mayor has called it &#39;dog whistle politics&#39; - and some are wondering why the Conservatives are borrowing the far right language of Tommy Robinson.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For the first time in American history a former president has been indicted (charged) with a criminal offence. Donald Trump will appear in a New York court on Tuesday afternoon. Do the charges stack up? Will they help Trump or hinder Trump? And how is this unprecedented moment going to impact the Presidential Race of 2024.?

        <description>Podcast Description Ten years on from the horse meat crisis, a new scandal has engulfed almost the entire food retail sector. Huge quantities of foreign pork - sometimes tens of thousands of tonnes a week - has been passed off, fraudulently as British. One meat processor - who can&#39;t be named for legal reasons - has been accused by former employees of &#39;washing&#39; hams that are visibly rotten, or mixing bad meat with fresh produce.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS TO BE HOUSED ON LUXURY CRUISE SHIP screamed the headline in the Daily Express. That was in February of 2016. And it never happened. The idea has been mooted in various ways about ten times in the last decades - including by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor in 2020. Each time the idea is dropped for being unworkable, unaffordable or illegal. So why do we keep falling for it?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand for Labour at the next election. That’s despite the fact he’s been an MP in Islington North since 1983 and led Labour at two general elections- nothing like it has ever happened before. Jon and Lewis explain why Labour’s ruling body has made the move and why Labour’s left might not be as weak as you might think.
And the News Agents are joined by a secret agent, or at least someone, who was.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description More mass protests in the streets- this time in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the rest of Israel.
Millions of Israelis believe their democracy to be in jeopardy. The airport is blocked, universities out of action, a general strike has been called. Even the diplomats won’t go to work. With academic and expert Ayala Panievsky, we explain why so many - both within the Israeli state and in the population at large - believe Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempt to transform the country’s judicial system to be a gross violation of democracy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this special episode of The News Agents, Lewis travels to Paris to find out why the City of Lights is on fire. Amidst the tear gas, the riot police, the stun grenades and the flames, The News Agents ask- what&#39;s happened? why is it this bad? And why could this riot be the start of a new, far-right, European order?
It all comes as huge protests have erupted across France after President Emmanuel Macron forced through a rise in the country’s pension age.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Keir Starmer spent the morning in Stoke-on-Trent. Not WOKE-on-Trent, as one hilarious Tory Red-wall-er reminded him. But attempts to fire up the culture war are something Rishi Sunak wants no part in.
And recent polling suggests it&#39;s the right call. Today we look at the state of play of the two main political parties and what the numbers are currently telling us -with James Kanagasoorium of Focaldata. And we ask whether we mind have a billionaire prime minister who pays a million pound tax bill.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson told the parliamentary inquiry that he HAD misled parliament, but he hadn&#39;t meant to. His repeated defence was that he hadn&#39;t been advised what he was saying might be wrong (he had). And that other people hadn&#39;t told him that rules might have been broken (they had). He insisted that the leaving parties he&#39;d attended had been essential work and berated Downing Street itself for having too many corridors to make parties safer.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Met Police - so says the explosive Casey Review released today - is a bullying boys club in which predators flourish. Rape evidence is thrown out - because of broken fridges.
Eye-watering force is used against Black people.
Gay officers are scared of their colleagues.
So what happens now? And will this diminish public trust in the force even further? The author of the review Baroness Louise Casey joins us.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson has submitted evidence to the Privileges Committee which will be judging whether he set out to mislead the House of Commons over Partygate. He argues that &#39;he was advised he wasn&#39;t breaking any rules&#39; - which might seem odd coming from the person who in fact made up those rules. We now await publication of his defence. Also today - why the DUP won&#39;t vote for Sunak&#39;s latest Brexit deal: The Windsor Framework.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After nearly a decade of stability spearheaded by Nicola Sturgeon, why do the SNP look like they&#39;re imploding? The three candidates after her job are spending day after day taking lumps out of each other. Polling suggests that the only thing that they&#39;re hurting though is their common goal: Scottish independence.
We speak to one of the candidates who&#39;s attack on the independence of the leadership process has been called &#39;Trumpian&#39;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today&#39;s bombshell rabbit (to mix a metaphor) was the Chancellor&#39;s promise to abolish the lifetime allowance on pensions.
If you&#39;re super-rich it&#39;s time to crack open the champagne. If you&#39;re working age and well-paid, it might keep you in your job longer - at least that&#39;s the aim- but this is against a backdrop where household disposable income is falling at its fastest rate since the 1950s. We talk childcare, taxation, potholes, and Brexit beer.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Last night more than forty Conservative MPs refused to back Suella&#39;s new plan for immigration. One- the former Lord Chancellor - called it &#39;ineffective authoritarianism&#39;. Another - the former Immigration Minister - called it &#39;an absolute horror&#39;. So today we tackle the policy head on. Is it legal? Is it humane? And will it lead fewer people taking small boats? We also look at police violence against women. The numbers are unbelievable - how, out of 1500 officers facing accusations of violence, have only 13 been dismissed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Gary Lineker will be back on air this weekend. And BBC Director General Tim Davie has apologised to viewers for the weekend&#39;s schedule disruptions. They&#39;d like this row to go away now. Except it won&#39;t. Where does it leave the BBC Chair and his Tory donations and friendships? Where does it leave the social media activities of other high profile talent? And what does impartiality mean - if it&#39;s being dictated by the government?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The BBC have told Gary Lineker he won&#39;t be presenting Match of the Day on Saturday night. Emily, Jon and Lewis bring you their immediate reaction.
Protests against drag queen story readings for kids have been gaining momentum in the US and increasingly the UK. This week in London there was a clash between protestors, arguing about whether these kinds of activities - where drag queens read stories to children - should be allowed to take place.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The coveted Crimes against the English Language award goes to Penny Mordaunt today for mangling almost a dozen football analogies into one short Commons speech. We are still trying to work out what a left wing striker is but for now what you need to know is that the Conservative frontbench is nervously awaiting a response to their small boats policy from President Macron tomorrow when Rishi Sunak goes to Paris.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Gary Lineker has responded to the furore surrounding his tweet on the government&#39;s asylum policy with the promise to &#39;keep speaking for those with no voice&#39;. It&#39;s being reported on the BBC News website - whist - we understand - the BBC is currently trying to give Lineker &#39;a frank talking to&#39; for breaking impartiality rules. How do the BBC rules on impartiality work? We speak here from a little experience.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Tories have produced - at last count - over forty different failed policies to stop channel crossings. Today, Suella Braverman came up with the latest.
It will prevent anyone arriving here by small boat from claiming asylum or doing so in the future. And it promises to detain them for 28 days after which they will be returned. Without quite explaining where... or how. We ask if this desperate measure will break the Geneva Convention - the UN Convention of Human Rights - and talk to former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw.</description>

We also ask why Keir Starmer seems to be unwilling or unable to answer a simple question: when did he first appoint Sue Gray? Does this all go back to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case?</description>

He was her source and she turned on him by taking 100,000 of her Whatsapp messages to The Telegraph. The revelations have gripped Westminster- she tells us there’s more to come. We talk to her about her motivations. And we talk all things Sue Gray, that once famous woman of Westminster who investigated Boris Johnson and Partygate, off to become…Keir Starmer’s Chief of Staff.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson is back. But then again, he never really went away. In a speech today at a soft power forum, he takes a swing at Rishi Sunak and his Windsor Framework after two days of lying low. We discuss the continual Johnson-shaped fly in the Sunak ointment.
And Jon and Lewis go through the latest Hancock WhatsApp developments in the Lockdown Files story, and talk to Mehdi Hasan, MSNBC anchor and author of Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading and Public Speaking to talk about misinformation in the US media.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Telegraph have released a slew of Matt Hancock&#39;s Whatsapp messages from when he was Health Secretary, at the height of the Covid 19 pandemic.
Lewis and Jon discuss the politics of the investigation, and the ethics, or lack thereof, of the journalist behind the release of the messages. And is Matt Hancock, quite simply, a plonker?

        <description>Podcast Description We said yesterday that Rishi Sunak had taken a massive gamble announcing a new deal for Northern Ireland without having necessarily laid the political groundwork beforehand. Well, 24 hours later, and it feels like he might have pulled off a blinder. The far-right of his Tory party are...quiet, and the DUP seem cautiously optimistic. Perhaps most importantly, Boris Johnson, a key potential spanner in Sunak&#39;s works, hasn&#39;t poked his head above the parapet.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For Northern Ireland Protocol, now read Windsor Framework. A beaming Rishi Sunak and European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, have signed what MIGHT come to be seen as an historic agreement to solve the conundrum of the status of Northern Ireland post-Brexit. Might, because we don&#39;t know how the loyalist, unionist DUP will react, nor the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, the ERG, potentially led by mischief-maker-in-chief, Boris Johnson.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1156650233/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description The environment and food secretary has suggested that - faced with a tomato shortage - people should just eat turnips instead. It’s all a bit Marie Antoinette but just a bit more depressing. Today we look at the long-term problem behind our current empty shelves with Observer food critic Jay Rayner. And on the eve of the anniversary of Russia&#39;s second invasion of Ukraine, London&#39;s streets are blue and yellow - but is Putin successfully negotiating the West&#39;s economic sanctions?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Most fifteen year olds do stupid things. Rarely do they join a terrorist organisation in Syria. But today. Shamima Begum - the ISIS bride - lost her appeal - and with it her chance to regain UK citizenship. Do we feel safer as a country? Or soulless? And as Kate Forbes - committed Christian and SNP Finance Minister makes her case to lead Scotland, we ask another committed Christian, MP Tim Farron - once Lib Dem leader, now podcast host - if politics and religion can ever mix in Britain.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There is too much news today. Frankly. Putin tried to convince a domestic audience that NATO started the war in Ukraine, Rishi Sunak tried to face down Tory doubters telling him to drop his Northern Ireland deal, and the press and media are mulling over how to respond to accusations of intrusion by Nicola Bulley&#39;s grieving family. We hear from Northern Ireland Shadow Secretary Peter Kyle, Putin&#39;s former speechwriter Abbas Gallyanov, and former Head of News at ITN and formerly of broadcasting regulator Ofcom&#39;s Stewart Purvis.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Boris Johnson has been slapped down by a senior Conservative for his interventions on Rishi Sunak&#39;s latest Brexit deal over Northern Ireland. Is the former PM stirring up trouble to pave the way for a comeback? In the first interview since he left office, Johnson&#39;s former Director of Comms Guto Harri speaks exclusively to The News Agents and has a message for his old boss. And Lewis comes back from Rotherham, where he was over the weekend reporting on a far-right protest gathered outside a hotel housing asylum seekers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Rishi Sunak has been in Belfast, hoping he can be the Prime Minister to finally answer the question on the Northern Ireland Protocol. Can he break Brexit gridlock? And elsewhere in the United Kingdom questions over the strength of the Union have been raised by Nicola Sturgeon&#39;s decision to quit as leader of the Scottish National Party. Does her resignation signal the the start of the decline of the independence movement?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Lancashire Police have come under-fire for the revelations they made overnight about the missing mother Nicola Bulley who&#39;s not been seen for nearly three weeks. Why did they say so much - after weeks of near silence? And how damaging has that been to trust in the police? And we look at another communications disaster in the making - a train derailment in Ohio is threatening environmental catastrophe. Yet the authorities are accused of a cover up - and conspiracy theories are starting to flourish.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Sturgeon is stepping down as Scotland&#39;s First Minister. Jeremy Corbyn is banned from standing as a Labour MP. If there’s a broad News Agents take away it’s this: be careful about sitting down with Lewis Goodall. Today we look at what may lie behind Sturgeon&#39;s decision and what it could mean for Scottish independence. And we ask Diane Abbott - old friend of Jeremy Corbyn - is she backs the current or former Labour leader now.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The only NHS service in England to offer gender identity services to children announced it would be closing down last year - after years of whistleblowers who worked there trying to raise the alarm about a scandal in their midst: a failure to safeguard some of the country&#39;s most vulnerable young adults. What went wrong? And how much did the toxic political climate at the time over trans issues contribute to a work practice that was not fit for purpose.</description>

What does it tell us about a) the sky b) the relations we now have with one of our biggest trading partners, China. And - missing in action?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Childcare in Britain is broken and yet it is almost never talked about. Why? In this episode, Lewis dissects why Labour thinks this could be the key to a majority at the next election and why in 21st century Britain having children is fast becoming&amp;nbsp;a luxury item. We talk you through how the system has become so expensive and the fact that families increasingly find themselves wondering whether it’s worth both parents staying in work - or worth even having children at all.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Authoritarian regimes in both Syria and Turkey make a devastating situation even more complicated. How do we get aid in to help quake victims when the humanitarian corridors are limited and social media communication is censored?
In Turkey many want to know where the 30 billion pounds of funding that was meant to make buildings earthquake-proof has gone.
Meanwhile, Russia is on the move - coming to Syria&#39;s rescue.</description>

A speech that began with gracious tributes quickly got to its blunt point: A request for &#39;wings&#39; - fighter jets - which the US and UK previously turned down.

        <description>Podcast Description Liz Truss is back. And oh. So are those pauses. She tells Spectator TV she doesn&#39;t want to be PM again but she does want to promote her economic ideas. (You remember the ones that nearly melted the markets). We ask why there has been so little self reflection. And if her economic diagnosis might one day prove right...
And we speak to Malte Grunert - producer of the world&#39;s most harrowing film, All Quiet on the Western Front about German attitudes to war, modern warfare and German history.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Jeremy Corbyn’s time as Labour leader was one of the most extraordinary periods of modern politics. For a while he seemed like he’d moved the posts of politics. And yet now, he is a political ghost. He isn’t even a Labour MP. In this wide ranging and exclusive interview, Lewis talks to the man himself, at length about the prime ministers he knew, the biggest period of industrial unrest for decades, his successor, his suspension and the anti-Semitism saga which engulfed his leadership.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Little birdies have told The News Agents we can shortly expect Liz Truss to re-emerge onto the political scene. She&#39;s going to reiterate her ideology and perhaps address some of what went wrong in those fateful 49 days. Don&#39;t think of this as another bid for PM. She may be wanting to offer a Conservative template for future generations - think America&#39;s Republican firebrand Barry Goldwater in the 1960&#39;s who paved the way for Reaganism.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Brexit is three years old. And like a raging toddler after a missed lunchtime nap it&#39;s kicking and screaming its way through our national consciousness creating chaos as it goes. New polls suggest a sizeable proportion of those who voted for Brexit now regret it. What do those who created the Brexit deal make of it now? We talk at length to Lord David Frost - architect of the Northern Ireland Protocol and Chief Brexit Negotiator about why he still believes in it.</description>

And, who do you trust more: Boris Johnson, or the Kremlin?</description>

She’s on her fifth Tory Prime Minister. She’s bestrode Scottish politics for a decade.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The News Agents are on Nadhim-watch. Alas there have been no actual sightings of him this week, but he’s been talked about plenty. And now, the head of HMRC has been speaking about tax penalties, and not helpfully for the Tory party chairman, who appears to be edging ever closer to the brink.
There was further bad news for the government this morning as the latest car production figures show production is now down to its lowest level for over 60 years.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Prime Minister&#39;s Questions this afternoon, Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer landed the blow that seems to have thus far defined political discourse since PM Rishi Sunak took office. Is he too weak to sack ministers when he needs to? Is the job just too big for him? We discuss.

        <description>Podcast Description Nadhim Zahawi’s tax affairs are now becoming a problem for Rishi Sunak. The PM has asked for a full acount of what happened - a change of tune from last week when he said there was nothing to see. Does the PM show resilience from holding on to a colleague under-fire? Or weakness by refusing to face the awkward facts? And we speak to YouTube megastar Nas Daily about Chat GPT and replacing creatives with AI, artificial intelligence.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The BBC&#39;s mantra is that impartiality - and the perception of impartiality - must be at its core. Yet following revelations in The Sunday Times we are coming to understand the nature of the relationship between the former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his financial needs, and the current Chairman of the BBC - an old friend of his, Richard Sharp. Today, we ask why the Chairman failed to declare details that might have compromised that impartiality.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In our 100th episode, are students the forgotten part of our society? They&#39;re facing the cost of living crisis, a now near-permanent graduate tax, and many complain about the quality of their courses.
On this episode Lewis spends time with a group of Manchester students whose halls have vermin, and for which they&#39;re paying a pretty penny. And we take you through one of the biggest misunderstandings of modern British politics- how the student loan system, has stopped really working as a loans system, and is now, for all intents and purposes, a stealth tax.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Two of the big conflicts which define British politics- the culture war and the war for the Union, have fused together. The Scottish government&#39;s controversial Gender Recognition Bill, which would make it easier for people to legally change their gender and hailed by some as a great advance for trans rights, has been blocked, vetoed by the UK government.

        <description>Podcast Description It&#39;s quite a thing to pick a fight with a Holocaust survivor. But this weekend, The Home Office asked for the removal of a social media clip that showed Joan Salter MBE confronting Home Secretary Suella Braverman over what she called &#39;dehumanising&#39; rhetoric around refugees. The Home Office said the clip did not show the full exchange and had been heavily edited. Was the clip unfair? In stepping in, did the Home Office act out of order?</description>

But, what if that dial is shifting now? What if Keir Starmer&#39;s party feel so comfortable in their lead in the polls that the question of Brexit is reopened? He&#39;s been in Belfast, today, outlining measures that would soften the terms of the Brexit the UK subjected itself to two years ago.</description>

And the US Congress remains in gridlock after representatives failed to elect a speaker for the eleventh time (and counting). On the second anniversary of the January 6th insurrection, Lewis asks how much this is a product of Trump-era politics, and speaks to his former Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney about whether the Republican party are split beyond repair.</description>

Lewis has been down to the picket line at St. Thomas&#39; Hospital - just opposite the Houses of Parliament - to ask what the political and economic consequences of this strike could be.
And the last three parts of Harry and Meghan&#39;s Netflix doc take us inside a world of death threats, public birth, online harm and press management as we&#39;re taken behind the scenes of the row that spilt the two princes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Four people, at least, died this morning, after their dinghy capsized in the freezing waters of the English Channel. The more than 40 on board were trying to travel from France to England, presumably in search of a better life.
And yet, the Government could stop Channel crossing deaths tomorrow or at least substantially reduce the numbers and risk of death. And Labour, the party in opposition, could try and push that agenda.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the next election we will all be expected to show voter ID. Which is fine if you have a passport or a driving licence - but much much harder if you don&#39;t.
The Conservative party believes the change is important to counter voter fraud -and say it&#39;s really not a big ask to get people to ID themselves at the polls when they do for so much else.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The funding model of the NHS has always seemed sacrosanct, untouchable. We boast about having the finest service in the world - free at the point of demand to everyone. But - it doesn&#39;t take a brain surgeon to see the service is now at breaking point. The waiting lists, the A&amp;amp;E queues, the morale of doctors and nurses, the impending strikes and the shortage of staff more generally.</description>

Lewis casts an eye over all sectors taking industrial action over pay, workers rights and terms and conditions.
And then, we talk to England vs. France. But not the football. We&#39;re joined by two French people who have lived in the UK for decades; and they discuss the complex relationship between England and France; culturally, historically and in the present day, post-Brexit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Overnight in Germany three thousand police have made two dozen arrests after uncovering a far right plot to overthrow the German state. The group were preparing for Day X- and an attempt to storm the Bundestag, the German parliament, taking MPs hostage. It’s the stuff of horror, nightmare and fantasy - conspiracy rooted in Germany&#39;s pre-war history and America&#39;s modern QAnon movement. Today we speak to a senior MP from Germany’s governing SPD party, Nils Schmid, and from the author of Going Dark, Julia Ebner - who’s gone undercover with conspiracy networks and made extremism her life’s study.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Tory Peer Michelle Mone is to take a leave of absence from the House of Lords to &#39;clear her name&#39; from the allegations she profited to the tune of more than £20 million from a PPE Covid contract. She hasn&#39;t voted in the Lords since the end of April - just days before her home was raided by the National Crime Agency. And today, Labour has urged the lower chamber, the House of Commons to vote to secure the release of secret texts, emails and documents relating to the 200 million pounds of contracts secured by the PPE Medpro company.</description>

What must that feel like? On this episode of The News Agents we speak to someone who&#39;s been there, done that and has got the badge (the prison sentence). Nick Leeson single-handedly brought down one of Britain&#39;s most famous financial institutions in 1995 - Barings Bank - and spent four years in a Singapore jail as a result.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Sir Keir Starmer wants private schools to pay more tax. He&#39;s also talking about removing their charitable status. Today at PMQ&#39;s he asked the PM why Winchester deserved 6 million pounds to spend on rowing clubs and rifle clubs which could be going to fund the state sector instead. Is the country where Starmer is now - or does this policy represent a polemic talking point which creates more class warfare than cash?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Bird Flu is bringing Britain&#39;s farmers to their knees. The disease has killed nearly a hundred million birds world wide - nearly 4 million of them in the UK - and it poses a serious threat to our food supply. So today we&#39;re on a farm talking to a twitcher, a farmer and erm a motoring journalist. And it&#39;s all the same bloke. Jeremy Clarkson talks about the dearth of birds, the cost of feed and how hard it is to get pigs to make other pigs.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Dominic Raab is facing renewed allegations of bullying behaviour. In this episode we turn the clock back to the time he took out a &#39;confidentiality agreement&#39; -which lawyers tell us is EXACTLY the same as an NDA; a non-disclosure agreement. In 2011 he refused to release the woman who signed it from being able to tell her side of the story. We hear from Mark Stephens, a solicitor, who shows us how NDAs are being used and abused in the corridors of power.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Qatar has gone from being a quietly successful, enormously rich, largely anonymous speck on the world map to being a pariah of the Middle East. It had hoped hosting the World Cup would bring fame and more fortune - not the unedifying stink of corruption and rows about workers, women and LGBTQ+ rights. Are they wondering if it was all worth it? And will a gratifyingly rampant England victory finally stir the relatively subdued fans watching back home?</description>

Lewis travels back to Birmingham to visit a community centre which provides food and warmth for the local community, and he’s joined back in News Agents HQ by Torsten Bell, of the Resolution Foundation, and Duncan Robinson from The Economist to unpick the structural reasons of how it can be that the government is taxing more than ever before, yet public services are as bad as they are right now.</description>

Not even the legion advisors telling him now was a really really bad time to announce it. He&#39;s on a bit of a low - the midterm results were a stinging rejection of the candidates he backed - and the election deniers were - ultimately - rejected at the polls. You can hear a very on-message, subdued Trump in the speech he made last night.</description>

And we&#39;re joined by the former Secretary of State for the Department of Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs, George Eustice, who stood up in the House of Commons yesterday to brandish a trade deal he endorsed last year when he was in government &#39;a not very good deal&#39;.</description>

He calls on Beckham as a role model and ally to think about gay football fans in a country that criminalises homosexuality.

        <description>Podcast Description We often hear about mortgage rates going up, but perhaps not enough scrutiny is paid on the private renting sector... a sector that has enormous demand, and next to no supply. It&#39;s a sector that burns a mile-wide hole in the coffers of students, young professionals, families and many more. The Mini-Budget just seven weeks ago exacerbated the crisis to near breaking point.
But who&#39;s to blame? And how do we fix it?</description>

What does that mean for the next presidential contest? Does it allow Biden to seek a second term?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Liz Truss was looking to galvanise not just the Tory party but the nation in her conference speech, she turned to Just Stop Oil protesters for help. She believed their fractious, disruptive, an d potentially dangerous tactics would make her &#39;anti growth&#39; point better than any positive messaging she had hitherto used. As it turned out, she&#39;s now gone and they are still here - this morning blockading several more parts of the M25 motorway in the UK as the COP27 climate conference got underway in Egypt.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Elon Musk has begun laying off staff at Twitter, a week after taking sole control of the company. He says he’s “freed the bird” but does freedom of speech on the platform come at the price of political stability and threats to democracy?

        <description>Podcast Description In less than a week America will head to the polls for the midterms - the first national elections of the Biden presidency since the January 6th insurrection.
Biden has told Americans that democracy is on the ballot - with hundreds of Republican candidates refusing to say whether they’ll accept the election outcome next week. Many more within the GOP continue to accept and propagate ‘The Big Lie’- that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As we record today&#39;s episode, Benjamin Netanyahu - currrently on trial for corruption charges - is about to (re)become Israel&#39;s PM. He&#39;s been in power for 17 years out of the last 25. And this time, it&#39;s all thanks to the Religious Zionism faction - a theocratic movement far far to his right that doesn&#39;t altogether believe in democracy. What does this mean for Israel, her neighbours, the Arab vote and indeed long-term peace?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description So much heat surrounds the issue of immigration. And the person in charge of decision making is Home Secretary Suella Braverman - and she&#39;s at the centre of a political storm over alleged multiple security breaches. Today The News Agents ask where the crisis lies, and what the numbers really tell us. We speak to the former Brexit secretary David Davis - does he have confidence in the Home Secretary?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Gary Lineker tells us about the burger he shared with David Beckham in a hotel bar in Zurich the night before England was knocked out of the bid to host the 2018 Football world cup. What happened next, he says, was unbelievable. Qatar - against virtually every single odd - was chosen to host the 2022 tournament. The REST, as they say IS HISTORY. Fast forward 12 years and Gary speaks of his responsibility to tell it like it is when he&#39;s out there - even if it annoys his Qatari hosts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After weeks of political chaos, the real cost of the crisis is beginning to reveal itself. Lewis is joined this week by New Statesman columnist Martha Gill. They speak to Tim Durrant, Associate Director at the Institute for Government, about the staggering bill to the taxpayer, caused by an unprecedented number of ministerial redundancies over the summer. They look to Northern Ireland, and a grid-locked Stormont. Belfast-based journalist Amanda Ferguson talks to them about the quickening decline in relations there, and the possibility of fresh elections in December.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We’ve had the Brexit Opportunities Minister and the Brexit Benefits Department but weirdly - we still can’t point to what those are.
Today we ask if the UK economy is measurably worse off after Brexit (spoiler : the answer is yes) and what the solutions are. We hear the position of business, and talk to Tony Danker, the Director General of the Confederate of Business Industry. We look at the metrics with the Financial Times&#39; Peter Foster that tell us what Brexit has done to growth.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Lib Dems have called for an investigation into why Suella Braverman is back in her role as home secretary one week after she resigned and apologised for security leaks, and a day after Rishi Sunak promised a government of integrity. Labour tabled an urgent question to ask the same thing in the House of Commons today. But the Home Secretary didn&#39;t appear to even turn up. Instead, it was left to the blokes - Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer - to face off at PMQs.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Liz Truss and her podium left Downing Street around ten thirty this morning, with a brief nod to bravery and her excellent plans for cutting taxes. Rishi Sunak came in an hour later - new podium - and talked about restoring integrity and professionalism to the office of PM. There were no prizes for guessing who he meant. He also made clear he was there because of Liz Truss mistakes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At 1.57pm this afternoon, Penny Mordaunt&#39;s team were still insisting she would make it through to the final run off with Rushi Sunak to become Britain&#39;s next prime minister. But, just two minutes before the 2pm deadline, she pulled out of the race, crowning Rishi Sunak as the next Conservative party leader and the UK&#39;s first British Asian Prime Minister. It&#39;s quite a moment. Today The News Agents take stock of what we know about him, what we don&#39;t, and what his leadership will mean for the rest of the country.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The News Agents convene for a special Sunday night episode. Jon, Emily and Lewis talk through the big news breaking just an hour or so earlier that Boris Johnson, the former Prime Minister, has decided *not* to throw his hat in the ring for this truncated leadership election, despite the backing of dozens of MPs and sizeable support amongst Conservative Party members. It paves the way for one of either Rishi Sunak, ex-Chancellor, or Penny Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons, to become the UK&#39;s third premier of 2022.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the week to end all weeks, we&#39;ve lurched from the shortest prime ministerial era *ever* to the potential return of the last PM... who&#39;s only been an ex-PM for 45 days. The race to be our next Conservative Prime Minister is well and truly on (again!). Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt has already thrown her hat into the ring, and the rumour is that former Chancellor Rishi Sunak will follow too.</description>

Today&#39;s episode looks at the events that led to Truss’ resignation after just 45 days in office, the candidates in the running to take over, and the likelihood of an early general election.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After yesterday&#39;s stunning economic U-turn, today was a day where it was eerily quiet... almost too quiet. Why? Have the Conservatives finally decided to coalesce around their beleaguered leader? Was Jeremy Hunt&#39;s announcement enough to quell the baying wolves? It certainly calmed the markets down.
We explore what&#39;s happening now, what manoeuvring could be going on behind the scenes, and how pivotal tomorrow&#39;s Prime Minister&#39;s Questions is for her.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today saw one of the biggest political U-turns in the UK for decades. The new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared on our TV screens announcing a raft of economic changes. Liz Truss, our Prime Minister, was nowhere to be seen.
We ask four questions today:
1) What just happened?
2) Why has the Government done it?
3) What does it mean for you, the listener? 4) And what does it mean for Truss and the chances of premiership?</description>

As half the government briefs journalists that U-turns are on the horizon, and the other half refutes the concept as preposterous, the only thing that&#39;s clear is that it is dark days for this Conservative government, and for Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Kyiv awoke to bombs, explosion and the sour smell of retaliation.
Putin had spent his 70th birthday weekend watching his precious road bridge that linked Crimea to mainland Russia blown to pieces. And today was his fightback. Revenge served just two days cold.
75 missiles launched at targets across Ukraine. Poeple on their way to work. Parks, children’s playgrounds all the seemingly pointless target of Putin’s anger. We hear from John Sweeney - in his shower as the shells hit Kyiv - and from the US special envoy to Ukraine and former NATO Ambassador Kurt Volker.</description>

And it&amp;rsquo;s been a hectic few weeks at the major party conferences, but what do the voters really think of the state of politics? Lewis went to a focus group in Swindon to ask what they make of Liz Truss and her opposite number Keir Starmer.</description>

She got misty eyed as she imagined a newspaper front page showing a plane full of asylum seekers being deported to Rwanda. We seem to have come a long way from Martin Luther King.
But as the PM heads off to Prague to talk migrant crossings with her friend-or-foe Emmanuel Macron, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d take a look at the plan for Tory immigration - and ask whether the PM and her Home Secretary even agree.</description>

She coined a new phrase for her collective dislikes, “the anti growth coalition“ - a phrase that rather reminded us of Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s old playlist,“enemies of the people&amp;quot;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A senior Conservative MP has told The News Agents Liz Truss is facing a critical moment and may have just ten days to save her job.
Party discipline appears to be crumbling before our eyes. Ministers are openly touting policies they favour or reject and some are even telling each other to quietly go away. There is a restlessness at the Conservative Party Conference which tells you things haven’t really gone back to normal.</description>

The Prime Minister, who’d insisted just yesterday her top rate tax cut was here to stay, decided… it wasn’t. By 7am this morning the whole policy had been ditched. Changes in unpopular policy can be a good thing. But if Liz Truss and her chancellor thought this would end the conversation, they’re in for a shock.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s been a chaotic week in British politics. The slide of sterling, Bank of England interventions and a record poll showing a 33-point lead for Labour. Prime Minister Liz Truss is just three weeks into the job, and next week she&amp;rsquo;ll have to face the party, and nation, at Conservative Party Conference. Can she survive this? Lewis is joined by former Conservative MP David Gauke and former advisor to Tony Blair, Baroness Sally Morgan.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The prime minister crashes the airwaves after crashing the economy. We take stock of how bad this morning&amp;rsquo;s regional morning round was for Liz Truss, and what this says of her ability to communicate to the public on a local and national level. Between The News Agents, they have interviewed every prime minister since and including Margaret Thatcher- discuss the quirks of the trade - and whether Truss&amp;rsquo; style will bode well, or ill, for the rest of her premiership.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Make no mistake - the UK economy is crumbling. And this is not at the hands of a crisis beyond these shores. The Prime Minister and her Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s decisions last Friday have sent the British economy into total freefall. In the last 24 hours, the IMF, a monetary body that only ever springs into action for countries in crisis have issued stark warnings against &amp;lsquo;Trussonomics&amp;rsquo;, and the Bank of England have made emergency interventions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Keir Starmer has just made his bid to be the next UK prime minister - against a backdrop of severe economic chaos. It was a speech heavy on patriotism, green policy and the promise to fix Britain. And he even mentioned the B word - Brexit - looking to pull in leave voters lost to the Conservatives at the last election.
It landed well in the hall (of course), but how will it land outside the conference bubble?</description>

The tide seems to be turning Europe&amp;rsquo;s most significant war in eight decades. Ukrainian forces moved at lightning pace over the weekend to recapture their towns from a beleaguered Russian army in the north-east of the country. But are we sure this is really all that significant? We speak to broadcaster and journalist Gabriel Gatehouse.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For the first time in over 70 years, the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s head of state is a King, not a Queen. Charles III begins his reign as a monarch already well known to his public. His long held views have been aired, his life documented by television and tabloids, his relationships picked over through fifty years of adult life.
How will this change the type of monarchy we have and the connection the king and his country share?</description>
