        <description>So are we supposed to start the podcast?
Ready?
Okay.
Better.
Okay.
How are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good.
How are you?
It feels like it&amp;rsquo;s been a year.
I know.
You went to the Grand Caymans.
You went to Paris and London.
Paris and London.
And we were separated for like eight days.
I was very, very sad.
I think I did text you halfway through and I was like, I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed to tell you that</description>

        <description>Welcome to I&amp;rsquo;ve Had It. Thank you. Jenny, tell the listener about our exciting news.
Listener, we are now available on Patreon where you can subscribe to hear all sorts
of bonus content, blooper reels, dramatic readings of hate comments, and you can follow
along in Pumps&amp;rsquo;s journey. And if we get 1 million subscribers, Pumps will take off her
clothes and balance a wire hanger on her nipple. I didn&amp;rsquo;t say take off all my clothes.</description>

        <description>Welcome to your Thursday therapy session and a place to dump all of your petty grievances
with myself, Jennifer, and the star of our show, our shining bright little diamond, Pumps.
I almost think you might be just a little bit twerked about that.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s so fun to say, and the star of our show, our bright, shiny little diamond.
Zip it.
Zip it.
But you are the star of our show and my very best friend and one of my favorite people</description>

Good.
Okay.
Way to go.
So you don&amp;rsquo;t feel well today, huh?
No.
I cannot kick this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with this sickness.
So, listener, if you notice that Pumps is hacking and sounds a little ill, she&amp;rsquo;s under
the weather.
But we are going to push through because that&amp;rsquo;s how dedicated we are on this podcast journey
and manifesting this podcast.</description>

And it is such a service to us to remind us what else we need to be annoyed with.
Right.
And that we&amp;rsquo;re our people.</description>

Yeah.
You could do a little shimmy afterwards.
Yes.
A big shimmy.
A clap and a big shimmy with the Sagin&amp;rsquo; Dragons.
Yep.

        <description>Pumps, what have you had it with this week?
I have had it with my kids&amp;rsquo; cell phones constantly dinging, like vibrating.
Like we sit down to watch a movie and we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a vibration, like an earthquake
of everybody&amp;rsquo;s phone, like, and it&amp;rsquo;s all that fucking Snapchat.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.
And they&amp;rsquo;re wondering why ADD is on the rise.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s because these fucking phones go off every 10 seconds or one second.</description>

Great.
I was wondering what you&amp;rsquo;ve had it with this week.
Oh, my gosh.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with this week is people bragging.
And let me give you an example.
Okay.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it.
So, I have a friend that moved into a new house.
Okay.
And she built, decorated furniture, wallpaper, all that.
I mean, she was not going to hire a designer because her taste is so good.</description>

Pumps, what have you had it with this week?
Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m new to social media, but what I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with is like chain letters
on social media.
Like remember back in the 80s, it was like you have to send this to 10 people or they&amp;rsquo;ll
die or something horrible is going to happen.</description>

        <description>Well, what have you had it with this week?
What I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with is the inefficiency of people in the self-checkout line.
It&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to do it.
So this is what happened the other day.
I need like three things.
So I run in, I don&amp;rsquo;t even get a cart, I just am holding them in my hand.

        <description>Okay, ready?
One, two, three.
Awesome.
Good.
Hi, Jenny.
How are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good.
How are you?
Good.
What have you had it with?
I have had it with the continued idiocy of people that see the sign on the front door
of my office and continue to walk in to suite two looking for other suites.
I&amp;rsquo;m really anxious to greet one of the people at the door and say, step outside here.</description>

        <description>How many of the full do you drink per day, that full Stanley cup?
It&amp;rsquo;s 40 ounces.
I would say probably minimum of six.
Six?
Six times 40, what&amp;rsquo;s that?
Let me try it.
It&amp;rsquo;s heavy.
See, it&amp;rsquo;s heavy.
Oh my God, you just got it all over your white shirt.
Shit.
Oh, 200 ounces of that per day?
Probably.
I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear to put my mouth on that.</description>

        <description>Make sure your mind gets close to you.
Um, okay, should the pups do the clapping?
Should we fix her hair first?
What is happening to my hair?
Well, fix it!
Be nice!
Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean, like, should we fix it?
For God&amp;rsquo;s sake!
She was contemplating what to happen.
I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, Millie.
That was so mean.
Fix it!
Is that better?

        <description>Do you still have those bat wings?
Bat wings?
I thought you told me, like, your vagina, you had those, like, so you still have the
meat flaps.
Okay, do the clapping.
Do the clapping before this takes a sinister turn.
One, two, three.
That sucked.
You always say it sucks.
One, two, three.
Why do you have to count before you do it?
She&amp;rsquo;s mixing it up.

        <description>Pops, anything interesting happen to you this week?
No, but I&amp;rsquo;m about to gag over my own breath right now because it&amp;rsquo;s so terrible.
What did you eat?
Caesar salad and it&amp;rsquo;s bad, so don&amp;rsquo;t try to French kiss me.
You will not be happy.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting you bring up French kissing because we&amp;rsquo;re going to get into this
episode, fetishes.
I cannot wait, like I&amp;rsquo;m salivating at the thought, I&amp;rsquo;m so excited.</description>

        <description>There you are.
Oh, do I need to get my glasses?
Did you put on panties?
I did.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s like National Commando Day.
Every day is National Commando Day for me, except with this dress on.
So what made you want to wear panties today?
You don&amp;rsquo;t want your vagine on?
I don&amp;rsquo;t want the vagine all over the podcast.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already got my armpit.
Fix me, Nelly.
That is a very loaded request, yes.</description>

        <description>Jay Welch, let me tell you what I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with today.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it.
So I went to this yoga studio, and they make you sign all this shit.
So I gave my phone number.
So when I&amp;rsquo;m leaving afterwards, I tell the girl straight up to her face, I can&amp;rsquo;t ever
come back because it&amp;rsquo;s too hot.
It was 85 degrees.
So I come out and tell her, and I was like, take me off your list.</description>

Okay. Clap one. One, two, three.
So are we supposed to start the podcast? You want to start?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start.
Okay. So I think the people kind of wanted us to do a podcast.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird, but yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it.
Especially our children. We&amp;rsquo;re the biggest pushers.</description>
