The Pinto caught fire, and the three teenagers died. This week, we revisit a 2020 episode with a former Ford insider who played a key role in weighing the risks associated with the Pinto.

But maybe we should be focusing our energies elsewhere. In this episode from 2020, political scientist Eitan Hersh says there&amp;rsquo;s been a rise in &amp;ldquo;political hobbyism&amp;rdquo; in the United States.

But economist Amir Sufi says the way we traditionally address a recession is deeply flawed. He argues that by encouraging &amp;ldquo;sugar-rush&amp;rdquo; solutions, the nation is putting poor and middle-class Americans and the entire economy at even greater risk. This week we look at the role of debt as a hidden driver of recessions, and how we might create a more stable system.</description></item><item><title>A Rap on Trial | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930203/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 20:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930203/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the past few weeks, the nation has been gripped by protests against police brutality toward black and brown Americans. The enormous number of demonstrators may be new, but the biases they&amp;rsquo;re protesting are not. In 2017, we looked at research on an alleged form of bias in the justice system. This week, we revisit that story, and explore how public perceptions of rap music may have played a role in the prosecution of a man named Olutosin Oduwole.</description></item><item><title>The Air We Breathe | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930204/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 23:18:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930204/</guid><description>Podcast Description President Trump said this week that a few &amp;ldquo;bad apples&amp;rdquo; were to blame for police killings of black people. But research suggests that something more complicated is at play — a force that affects everyone in the culture, not just police officers. In this bonus episode, we revisit our 2017 look at implicit bias and how a culture of racism can infect us all.

What we don&amp;rsquo;t tend to ask is: Who have we harmed by treating this person withmore kindness than we show toward others? This week, in the second of our two-part series on moral decision-making, we consider how actions that come from a place of love can lead to a more unjust world.</description></item><item><title>Justifying The Means | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930206/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 21:39:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930206/</guid><description>Podcast Description When we are asked to make a moral choice, many of us imagine it involves listening to our hearts. To that, philosopher Peter Singer says, &amp;ldquo;nonsense.&amp;rdquo; Singer believes there are no moral absolutes, and that logic and calculation are better guides to moral behavior than feelings and intuitions. This week, we talk with Singer about why this approach is so hard to put into practice, and look at the hard moral choices presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.</description></item><item><title>The Time Machine | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930207/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 00:46:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930207/</guid><description>Podcast Description In recent months, many of us have looked back with longing at our lives before COVID-19.

This week, we return to a 2019 episode that investigates a specific source of racial disparities in medicine and beyond—and considers an uncomfortable solution.

This is one of the key opportunities that students and families have lost, as social distancing precautions lead schools to cancel in-person graduations. In this &amp;ldquo;commencement address,&amp;rdquo; recorded at the request of the public radio program 1A, Shankar Vedantam offers thoughts on what it means to mark such a milestone at this moment, and how graduates can use the disruption caused by the pandemic to think about their lives in new ways.</description></item><item><title>The Dramatic Cure | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930211/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930211/</guid><description>Podcast Description In recent months, many of us have become familiar with the sense of fear expressing itself in our bodies. We may feel restless or physically exhausted. At times, we may even have trouble catching our breath.

In the United States, where choice is often equated with freedom and control, the answer tends to be a resounding &amp;lsquo;yes.&amp;rsquo; But researchers say the relationship between choice and happiness isn&amp;rsquo;t always so clear-cut.

Though the value of local journalism is more apparent now than ever, newspapers are not thriving. They&amp;rsquo;re collapsing. For many communities, this means fewer local stories and job losses.

What we may not realize — and what physicians and researchers have only recently started emphasizing — is the importance of these connections to our physical health.

Time and technology have perfected the artificial lover: today we have life-size silicone love dolls so finely crafted they feel like works of art.

Psychologist Michele Gelfand defines these two ways of being as &amp;ldquo;tight&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;loose.&amp;rdquo; She says the tight/loose framework can help us to better understand individuals, businesses, and even nations.

The body tests positive for a deadly infectious disease. Authorities trace the killing to a gang. They race to find the gang members, who may also be incubating the virus.

Maybe you were nervous or worried about what the person would think of you. Chances are that you didn&amp;rsquo;t stop to think about the pressure you were exerting on that person. This week, we explore a phenomenon that psychologists refer to as &amp;ldquo;egocentric bias,&amp;rdquo; and look at how this bias can lead us astray.

But maybe we should be focusing our energies elsewhere. Political scientist Eitan Hersh says there&amp;rsquo;s been a rise in &amp;ldquo;political hobbyism&amp;rdquo; in the United States. We treat politics like entertainment, following the latest updates like we follow our favorite sports teams. Instead, he says, we should think of politics as a way to acquire power and persuade our neighbors to back the issues we support.</description></item><item><title>When Things Click | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930225/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:35:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930225/</guid><description>Podcast Description There can be a lot of psychological noise involved in teaching.

It seems like an easy question to answer: if you can see it, hear it, or touch it, then it&amp;rsquo;s real, right? But what if this way of thinking is limiting one of the greatest gifts of the mind?

When researchers at the University of Chicago asked that question, the answer was a laundry list of slights: a stolen jacket, or a carelessly lobbed insult. It made them wonder whether crime rates could be driven down by teaching young men to pause, take a deep breath, and think before they act.

It turns out that our capacity to be easily fooled in books and movies is made possible by a handful of predictable mental shortcuts. In this 2018 conversation, we talk with Vera Tobin, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s first cognitive scientists to study plot twists. She says storytellers have been exploiting narrative twists and turns for millennia — and that studying these sleights of hand can give us a better understanding of the contours of the mind.</description></item><item><title>Did That Really Happen? | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930232/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:20:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930232/</guid><description>Podcast Description Our memories are easily contaminated.

One of the most widely-used tools to confront this crisis is a drug called naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose within seconds, and has been hailed by first responders and public health researchers. But earlier this year, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior — and causing more deaths than it saves.</description></item><item><title>Radio Replay: Too Little, Too Much | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930296/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 21:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930296/</guid><description>Podcast Description Have you ever noticed that when something important is missing in your life, your brain can only seem to focus on that missing thing?

The concrete jungles that we&amp;rsquo;ve built over the past century have allowed millions of us to live in close proximity, and modern economies to flourish. But what have we given up by moving away from the forest environments in which humans first evolved? This week, we discuss this topic with psychologist Ming Kuo, who has studied the effects of nature for more than 30 years.</description></item><item><title>Bullshit Jobs | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930305/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 01:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930305/</guid><description>Podcast Description Have you ever had a job where you had to stop and ask yourself: what am I doing here?

Economic theory has long told us the answer is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; But a half century ago, two psychologists — Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky — began to challenge this notion. Their work laid the foundation for behavioral economics and influenced many scholars who&amp;rsquo;ve followed in their footsteps. This week, we mark our 100th episode by talking with Daniel Kahneman about his collaboration with Tversky, and how their work transformed our thinking about judgment, memory, and the mind itself.</description></item><item><title>Men: 45, Women: 0 | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930336/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930336/</guid><description>Podcast Description More women are running for political office than ever before in American history.

For the most part, the allegations went nowhere. In 2017, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, more women came forward to accuse the same playwright of misconduct. This time, everyone listened. On this episode, we explore the story through the lens of social science research and ask, &amp;ldquo;Why Now?&amp;rdquo; What has changed in our minds and in our culture so that allegations of sexual harassment and assault are being taken so much more seriously than they were in the past?</description></item><item><title>Lost in Translation | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930341/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930341/</guid><description>Podcast Description Learning new languages can help us understand other cultures and countries.

Neuroscientist Tali Sharot says that&amp;rsquo;s actually for good reason. As a general rule, she says, it&amp;rsquo;s better to stick to your beliefs and disregard new information that contradicts them.

But as Neeru Paharia explains, the way we spend often says a lot about who we are, and what we want to project.

Summerville says regret doesn&amp;rsquo;t always have to be a negative force in our lives. Sometimes, it can be a hopeful emotion.

Who are we as a nation? What do we stand for, and what do we tolerate? The United States goes further than many other countries to protect speech — even hate-filled speech like that used in Charlottesville. In this episode, we look at how people use free speech arguments, and why the motivations behind these arguments may not be apparent — even to the people making them.</description></item><item><title>You 2.0: Getting Unstuck | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930372/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 01:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930372/</guid><description>Podcast Description At one time or another, many of us feel stuck: in the wrong job, the wrong relationship, the wrong city – the wrong life.

Education researchers call this phenomenon &amp;ldquo;summer melt,&amp;rdquo; and it has long been a puzzling problem.

More than fifty percent, on the other hand, were carried out by Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, or other far right groups. So why do Americans spend so much time worrying about &amp;ldquo;radical Islamic terrorism?&amp;rdquo; This week on Hidden Brain, we look at how the media over-covers some acts of terrorism — and quickly forgets others.</description></item><item><title>Rap on Trial | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930383/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930383/</guid><description>Podcast Description Olutosin Oduwole was an aspiring rapper and college student when he was arrested in 2007. He was given an unusual charge: &amp;ldquo;attempting to make a terrorist threat.&amp;rdquo; Prosecutors used his writings — which he maintains were rap lyrics — to build their case against him. This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit Oduwole&amp;rsquo;s story, and how public perceptions of rap music may have played a role.

Maybe the person who was shot really was threatening. Or maybe, the bias that leads cops to shoot affects us all. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore how unconscious bias can infect a culture — and how a police shooting may say as much about a community as it does about individuals.</description></item><item><title>Broken Windows | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930385/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930385/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the early 1980s, a couple of researchers wrote an article in The Atlantic that would have far-reaching consequences. The article introduced a new idea about crime and policing. It was called Broken Windows. The idea was simple: A broken window is a sign of a neglected community, and a neglected community is a place where crime can thrive. The researchers said, if police fixed the small problems that created visible signs of disorder, the big ones would disappear.</description></item><item><title>Me, Myself, and IKEA | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930386/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930386/</guid><description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s normal to feel drawn to people you share something with — whether that&amp;rsquo;s a name, or a birthday, or a common background. But did you know that women named Georgia also gravitate toward the state of Georgia? And Virginias are slightly more likely to move to Virginia? Or that people with the last name Carpenter are actually more likely to be carpenters? This week on Hidden Brain, we talk about all the subtle ways we prefer things that have something to do with us, and why that means, for example, we prefer that IKEA furniture we built ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Ep. 71: The Fox and the Hedgehog | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930387/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930387/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Greek poet Archilochus is known for the phrase, &amp;ldquo;The fox knows many things; the hedgehog one big thing.&amp;rdquo; This week, we&amp;rsquo;ll use this metaphor as a way to understand two different cognitive styles. The first is that of a tactician who is comfortable with nuance and contradiction (the fox), the second is that of a big thinker, motivated by one organizing idea (the hedgehog). We&amp;rsquo;ll explore this idea through the story of a pioneering surgeon whose hedgehog tendencies led him to great triumphs, and a heartbreaking tragedy.</description></item><item><title>Encore of Ep. 45: What Are The Odds? | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930388/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930388/</guid><description>Podcast Description This week on Hidden Brain: coincidences.

Many of us turn to Google when we have a deeply personal or embarrassing question. And we&amp;rsquo;re often more honest when we type our questions into search engines than when we answer surveys or talk to friends. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a former data scientist at Google, says our online searches provide unprecedented insight into what we truly think, want, and do.</description></item><item><title>Episode 69: Money Talks | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930390/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930390/</guid><description>Podcast Description How do you spend your money? On food, transportation, or housing? On shoes, cars, coffee, fancy restaurants? You might think you use money just to, you know, buy stuff. But as Neeru Paharia explains, the way we spend often says a lot about who we are, and what we want to project. We use money to express our values — by going to the local coffee shop instead of Starbucks, or by boycotting — or buycotting — Ivanka Trump shoes.</description></item><item><title>Ep. 68: Schadenfacebook | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930391/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930391/</guid><description>Podcast Description Millions of people around the world use social media every day to stay in touch with friends and family. But ironically, studies have shown that people who spend more time on these sites feel more socially isolated than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.

You&amp;rsquo;re in there 23 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is the reality of solitary confinement at prisons across the United States. Keramet Reiter, a criminology professor at UC Irvine, says that while some inmates in solitary are dangerous, others are there because they&amp;rsquo;re difficult for prisons to manage, or because of bureaucratic inertia. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at what happens in solitary confinement, and the psychological effects of being alone for long periods of time.</description></item><item><title>Ep. 66: Liar, Liar | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930394/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2017 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930394/</guid><description>Podcast Description Everybody lies.

When you&amp;rsquo;re desperately poor, you may constantly worry about making ends meet. When you&amp;rsquo;re lonely, you might obsess about making friends. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore the psychological phenomenon of scarcity and how it can affect our ability to see the big picture and cope with problems in our lives.

Neuroscientist Tali Sharot says that&amp;rsquo;s actually for good reason. As a general rule, she says, it&amp;rsquo;s better to stick to your beliefs and disregard new information that contradicts them. But this also means it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to change false beliefs. This week, we look at how we process information, and why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to change our views.</description></item><item><title>Encore of Ep. 24: Tribes and Traitors | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930397/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930397/</guid><description>Podcast Description Nearly a year ago, we ran an episode about one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most intractable divides: the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Since that story aired, a solution seems even more out of reach. We wanted to play this episode again, because it offers something we don&amp;rsquo;t often hear in the news: empathy for the other side.

When researchers at the University of Chicago asked that question, the answer was a laundry list of slights: a stolen jacket, or a carelessly lobbed insult. It made them wonder whether crime rates could be driven down by teaching young men to pause, take a deep breath, and think before they act. We&amp;rsquo;ll go inside a program that teaches Chicago teens to do just that, and explore the research on whether this approach actually works.</description></item><item><title>Episode 61: Just Sex | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930400/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930400/</guid><description>Podcast Description We all know casual sex isn&amp;rsquo;t about love.

In response, many people are looking to the past, to see what history can teach us. But this process can fraught with psychological peril.

Sociologist Arlie Hochschild felt this long before the rise of Donald Trump, and five years ago she went on a mission to understand the other side. She left her own liberal bubble in Berkeley, California for a conservative one, deep in the Louisiana bayou.</description></item><item><title>Episode 58: Pedestals and Guillotines | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930404/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930404/</guid><description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s inauguration season, which means balls, parades, and celebrations. We may love the pomp and circumstance, but there&amp;rsquo;s another, darker side to our psychology, too. Whether we like the new president or not, human beings have a strange and contradictory relationship with power and celebrity. We idolize the rich and famous, but also enjoy seeing them fall from their pedestals. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore this paradox: from Hollywood, to the White House, to the forests of Tanzania.</description></item><item><title>Episode 57: Slanguage | Hidden Brain</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4522930405/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4522930405/</guid><description>Podcast Description Young people have always used language in new and different ways, and it has pretty much always driven older people crazy.

Some critics take this as an indictment of the entire field — perhaps the best journals are only interested in publishing the &amp;ldquo;sexiest&amp;rdquo; findings, or universities are pressuring their faculty to publish more. But this week on Hidden Brain, we take a closer look at the so-called crisis.
