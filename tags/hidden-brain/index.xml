This week, we begin a two-part series that explains how and why humans are wired to pursue pleasure, and all the ways the modern world tempts us with addictive substances and behaviors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We all have moments in our lives when we see someone who could use a helping hand. It could be a friend who recently went through a breakup, an elderly person trying to load groceries into their car, or a stranger on the street who looks a little lost. We tell ourselves we should help, but then something stops us. This week, psychologist Amit Kumar helps us understand what keeps us from taking a moment to be kind, and how to overcome these barriers to create stronger, happier connections.</description>

But then he found out, nearly a decade later, what happened to Donovan after his conviction. This week on the show, we look at the unexpected aftermath of a crime, and what happens when adversaries meet in conversation instead of a courtroom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Would you consider yourself to be prejudiced against people who are different from you? Most of us would say no. But in the late 1990s, researchers created a test to measure biases that may be hidden from our conscious minds. Millions of people have taken it since, and not everyone likes what they&amp;rsquo;ve discovered. This week, we launch a two-part look at implicit bias with psychologist Mahzarin Banaji. We ask how is it that we can hold negative stereotypes — without being aware of them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In 1978, Judy, Lyn and Donna Ulrich were driving to a volleyball game when their Ford Pinto was hit from behind by a van. The Pinto caught fire, and the three teenagers died. This week, we revisit a 2020 episode with a former Ford insider who played a key role in weighing the risks associated with the Pinto. And we consider what his story tells us about a question we all face: is it possible to fairly evaluate our past actions when we know how things turned out?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Many Americans feel an obligation to keep up with political news. But maybe we should be focusing our energies elsewhere. In this episode from 2020, political scientist Eitan Hersh says there&amp;rsquo;s been a rise in &amp;ldquo;political hobbyism&amp;rdquo; in the United States. We treat politics like entertainment, following the latest updates like we follow our favorite sports teams. Instead, he says, we should think of politics as a way to acquire power and persuade our neighbors to back the issues we support.</description>

Iain argues that differences in the brain — and Western society&amp;rsquo;s preference for what one hemisphere has to offer — have had enormous effects on our lives.

By contrast, it takes more than two months for the average 40-year-old adult to laugh that many times. This week, we talk with behavioral scientist Jennifer Aaker of Stanford University about why so many of us fall off a “humor cliff” as we become adults. Plus, how we can inject more laughter into our lives, even during the most difficult of times.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description More than a century ago, millions of people around the world died in a massive influenza pandemic. The so-called &amp;ldquo;Spanish flu&amp;rdquo; outbreak of 1918 revealed a truth about viruses: they don&amp;rsquo;t just infect us biologically. They also detect fissures in societies and fault lines between communities. Historian Nancy Bristow says this remains true today, as we continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.This week, we revisit our 2020 conversation with Bristow, and consider what history can tell us about human behavior during public health crises.</description>

But economist Amir Sufi says the way we traditionally address a recession is deeply flawed. He argues that by encouraging &amp;ldquo;sugar-rush&amp;rdquo; solutions, the nation is putting poor and middle-class Americans and the entire economy at even greater risk. This week we look at the role of debt as a hidden driver of recessions, and how we might create a more stable system.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In recent months, many of us have looked back with longing at our lives before COVID-19. For many of us, that world was one of bustle and activity — marked by scenes of packed restaurants, crowded subway cars, and chaotic playgrounds. In this audio essay, Shankar discusses our wistfulness for the world before the pandemic, and why such nostalgia can actually help to orient us toward the future.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Far from being &amp;ldquo;the great equalizer,&amp;rdquo; COVID-19 has disproportionately sickened and killed African Americans and Latinos in the U.S. Many of the reasons for these inequalities reach back to before the pandemic began. This week, we return to a 2019 episode that investigates a specific source of racial disparities in medicine and beyond—and considers an uncomfortable solution.

        <description>Podcast Description In the months since the spread of the coronavirus, stories of selfishness and exploitation have become all too familiar: people ignoring social distancing guidelines, or even selling medical equipment at inflated prices. Most of our public and economic policies take aim at these sorts of people — the wrongdoers and the profiteers. But is there a hidden cost to the rest of us when we put bad actors at the center of our thinking?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Commencement ceremonies allow us to take stock of what we&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished and where we&amp;rsquo;re headed. This is one of the key opportunities that students and families have lost, as social distancing precautions lead schools to cancel in-person graduations. In this &amp;ldquo;commencement address,&amp;rdquo; recorded at the request of the public radio program 1A, Shankar Vedantam offers thoughts on what it means to mark such a milestone at this moment, and how graduates can use the disruption caused by the pandemic to think about their lives in new ways.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In recent months, many of us have become familiar with the sense of fear expressing itself in our bodies. We may feel restless or physically exhausted. At times, we may even have trouble catching our breath. The deep connection between mind and body that seems so salient now was also at the center of our episode about the placebo effect. This week, we return to this 2019 story that asks what placebos might teach us about the nature of healing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An abundance of choices is a good thing, right? In the United States, where choice is often equated with freedom and control, the answer tends to be a resounding &amp;lsquo;yes.&amp;rsquo; But researchers say the relationship between choice and happiness isn&amp;rsquo;t always so clear-cut. This week, we talk with psychologist Sheena Iyengar about making better decisions, and how she&amp;rsquo;s thinking about the relationship between choices and control during the coronavirus pandemic.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Amidst the confusion and chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us have sought out a long-trusted lifeline: the local newspaper. Though the value of local journalism is more apparent now than ever, newspapers are not thriving. They&amp;rsquo;re collapsing. For many communities, this means fewer local stories and job losses. But new research suggests there&amp;rsquo;s another consequence that&amp;rsquo;s harder to spot — one that comes with a hefty price tag for residents.</description>

Time and technology have perfected the artificial lover: today we have life-size silicone love dolls so finely crafted they feel like works of art. Now, with the help of robotics and artificial intelligence, these dolls are becoming even more like humans. This week, we revisit our 2019 story about the history of the artificial lover, and consider what love and sex look like in the age of robots.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We all know people who prefer to follow the rules, and others who prefer to flout them. Psychologist Michele Gelfand defines these two ways of being as &amp;ldquo;tight&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;loose.&amp;rdquo; She says the tight/loose framework can help us to better understand individuals, businesses, and even nations. This week, we look at the core traits of tight and loose worldviews, and how they may shape our lives — from interactions with our spouses to global efforts to fight the coronavirus.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It sounds like a movie plot: police discover the body of a young man who&amp;rsquo;s been murdered. The body tests positive for a deadly infectious disease. Authorities trace the killing to a gang. They race to find the gang members, who may also be incubating the virus. This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit our 2016 story about disease, panic, and how a public health team used psychology to confront an epidemic.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description We know that we live in an ever-changing world, but one thing we often overlook is demographic change. Whether the world&amp;rsquo;s population is growing or shrinking can affect many aspects of our lives, from the number of kids we have to the likelihood that we&amp;rsquo;ll live to old age. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore how our planet&amp;rsquo;s population is changing, and what that means for us in the century to come.</description>

Chances are that you didn&amp;rsquo;t stop to think about the pressure you were exerting on that person. This week, we explore a phenomenon that psychologists refer to as &amp;ldquo;egocentric bias,&amp;rdquo; and look at how this bias can lead us astray.

Political scientist Eitan Hersh says there&amp;rsquo;s been a rise in &amp;ldquo;political hobbyism&amp;rdquo; in the United States. We treat politics like entertainment, following the latest updates like we follow our favorite sports teams. Instead, he says, we should think of politics as a way to acquire power and persuade our neighbors to back the issues we support.</description>

It made them wonder whether crime rates could be driven down by teaching young men to pause, take a deep breath, and think before they act. In this 2017 episode, we go inside a program that teaches Chicago teens to do just that.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Why do we fall for surprise endings? It turns out that our capacity to be easily fooled in books and movies is made possible by a handful of predictable mental shortcuts. In this 2018 conversation, we talk with Vera Tobin, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s first cognitive scientists to study plot twists. She says storytellers have been exploiting narrative twists and turns for millennia — and that studying these sleights of hand can give us a better understanding of the contours of the mind.</description>

What they found is that the people we are when death is far in the distance may not be the people we become when death is near.

        <description>Podcast Description More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 — many of them from heroin and other opioids. One of the most widely-used tools to confront this crisis is a drug called naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose within seconds, and has been hailed by first responders and public health researchers. But in 2018, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior — and causing more deaths than it saves.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever flown in economy class on a plane, you probably had to walk through the first class cabin to get to your seat. Maybe you noticed the extra leg room. The freshly-poured champagne. Maybe you were annoyed, or envious. Social psychologist Keith Payne says we tend to compare ourselves with those who have more than us, but rarely with those who have less. This week, we explore the psychology of income inequality, and how perceptions of our own wealth shape our lives.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses last year — many of them from heroin and other opioids.

But earlier this year, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior — and causing more deaths than it saves.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Nearly a quarter century ago, a group of women accused a prominent playwright of sexual misconduct. For the most part, the allegations went nowhere. In 2017, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, more women came forward to accuse the same playwright of misconduct. This time, everyone listened. On this episode — originally broadcast in February 2018 — we explore the story through the lens of social science research and ask, &amp;ldquo;Why Now?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description If you live in a big city, you may have noticed new buildings popping up — a high-rise here, a skyscraper there. The concrete jungles that we&amp;rsquo;ve built over the past century have allowed millions of us to live in close proximity, and modern economies to flourish. But what have we given up by moving away from the forest environments in which humans first evolved? This week, we discuss this topic with psychologist Ming Kuo, who has studied the effects of nature for more than 30 years.</description>

But familiar ground may not be the best place to cultivate creativity. From science and business to music and the world of fashion, researchers have found that people with deep connections to people from other countries and cultures often see benefits in terms of their creative output.</description>

Education researchers call this phenomenon &amp;ldquo;summer melt,&amp;rdquo; and it has long been a puzzling problem.

Dan Ariely says we like to think it&amp;rsquo;s character — but in his research he&amp;rsquo;s found it&amp;rsquo;s more often opportunity. Dan Ariely is a professor at Duke University and the author of the book The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone — Especially Ourselves. We spoke to him in March 2017.</description>

When you&amp;rsquo;re desperately poor, you may constantly worry about making ends meet. When you&amp;rsquo;re lonely, you might obsess about making friends. This week, we bring you a March 2017 episode about the psychological phenomenon of scarcity. Researchers say this form of tunnel vision can affect our ability to see the big picture and cope with problems in our lives.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Do humans act rationally? Economic theory has long told us the answer is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; But a half century ago, two psychologists — Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky — began to challenge this notion. Their work laid the foundation for behavioral economics and influenced many scholars who&amp;rsquo;ve followed in their footsteps. This week, we mark our 100th episode by talking with Daniel Kahneman about his collaboration with Tversky, and how their work transformed our thinking about judgment, memory, and the mind itself.</description>

But in politics and many other fields, women still struggle to attain positions of power. Researchers say they&amp;rsquo;re often trapped in a &amp;ldquo;double bind&amp;rdquo; — a series of unconscious, interlocking stereotypes we have about men, women and the nature of leadership. This week, we take a closer look at the double bind as we revisit a favorite episode from October 2016.</description>

In 2017, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, more women came forward to accuse the same playwright of misconduct. This time, everyone listened. On this episode, we explore the story through the lens of social science research and ask, &amp;ldquo;Why Now?&amp;rdquo; What has changed in our minds and in our culture so that allegations of sexual harassment and assault are being taken so much more seriously than they were in the past?</description>

Neuroscientist Tali Sharot says that&amp;rsquo;s actually for good reason. As a general rule, she says, it&amp;rsquo;s better to stick to your beliefs and disregard new information that contradicts them. But this also means it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to change false beliefs. In this favorite episode from earlier this year, we look at how we process information, and why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to change our views.</description>

Plus, we ask whether we should think of violence as a disease, similar to a blood-borne pathogen in its ability to spread from person to person.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Discussions about healthy living usually revolve around diet and exercise. Social interaction is often left out of the conversation, even though research shows that it&amp;rsquo;s critical to our well-being. On this week&amp;rsquo;s radio replay, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore research on the extremes of social interaction: from the consequences of constant connection, to the high cost of solitary confinement.

But checklists are also proving essential in many modern-day workplaces, from operating rooms to the cockpits of jumbo jets. This week, we explore the power of the humble checklist to help us stay on track and focus on what&amp;rsquo;s important, particularly when pressure is intense and the stakes are high.

On this week&amp;rsquo;s Radio Replay, we explore our deep fascination with these moments of serendipity. New research suggests they reveal important things about how our minds work, and have a far more powerful effect on our lives than any of us imagine. We&amp;rsquo;ll also explore the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;implicit egotism&amp;rdquo; — the idea that we&amp;rsquo;re drawn to people and things that remind us of ourselves.</description>

We order dessert — even when we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be dieting. In other words, we misbehave. That&amp;rsquo;s the title of Richard Thaler&amp;rsquo;s most recent book: Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read Thaler&amp;rsquo;s previous book, Nudge, you know he&amp;rsquo;s an economist who studies why people don&amp;rsquo;t really act the way traditional economists say they will.</description>

Can gender differences be explained by genes and chromosomes, or are they the result of upbringing, culture and the environment? This week, we delve into the debate over nature vs. nurture, and meet the first person in the United States to officially reject the labels of both male and female, and be recognized as &amp;ldquo;non-binary.</description>

Who are we as a nation? What do we stand for, and what do we tolerate? The United States goes further than many other countries to protect speech — even hate-filled speech like that used in Charlottesville. In this episode, we look at how people use free speech arguments, and why the motivations behind these arguments may not be apparent — even to the people making them.</description>

More than fifty percent, on the other hand, were carried out by Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, or other far right groups. So why do Americans spend so much time worrying about &amp;ldquo;radical Islamic terrorism?&amp;rdquo; This week on Hidden Brain, we look at how the media over-covers some acts of terrorism — and quickly forgets others.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the early 1980s, a couple of researchers wrote an article in The Atlantic that would have far-reaching consequences. The article introduced a new idea about crime and policing. It was called Broken Windows. The idea was simple: A broken window is a sign of a neglected community, and a neglected community is a place where crime can thrive. The researchers said, if police fixed the small problems that created visible signs of disorder, the big ones would disappear.</description>

The first is that of a tactician who is comfortable with nuance and contradiction (the fox), the second is that of a big thinker, motivated by one organizing idea (the hedgehog). We&amp;rsquo;ll explore this idea through the story of a pioneering surgeon whose hedgehog tendencies led him to great triumphs, and a heartbreaking tragedy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Have you ever googled something that you would never dream of saying out loud to another human being? Many of us turn to Google when we have a deeply personal or embarrassing question. And we&amp;rsquo;re often more honest when we type our questions into search engines than when we answer surveys or talk to friends. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a former data scientist at Google, says our online searches provide unprecedented insight into what we truly think, want, and do.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description How do you spend your money? On food, transportation, or housing? On shoes, cars, coffee, fancy restaurants? You might think you use money just to, you know, buy stuff. But as Neeru Paharia explains, the way we spend often says a lot about who we are, and what we want to project. We use money to express our values — by going to the local coffee shop instead of Starbucks, or by boycotting — or buycotting — Ivanka Trump shoes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Millions of people around the world use social media every day to stay in touch with friends and family. But ironically, studies have shown that people who spend more time on these sites feel more socially isolated than those who don&amp;rsquo;t. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore the psychological effects that social media has on us, and how FOMO — or, the fear of missing out — can lead to actually missing out.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Imagine a concrete room, not much bigger than a parking space. You&amp;rsquo;re in there 23 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is the reality of solitary confinement at prisons across the United States. Keramet Reiter, a criminology professor at UC Irvine, says that while some inmates in solitary are dangerous, others are there because they&amp;rsquo;re difficult for prisons to manage, or because of bureaucratic inertia. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at what happens in solitary confinement, and the psychological effects of being alone for long periods of time.</description>

When you&amp;rsquo;re desperately poor, you may constantly worry about making ends meet. When you&amp;rsquo;re lonely, you might obsess about making friends. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore the psychological phenomenon of scarcity and how it can affect our ability to see the big picture and cope with problems in our lives.

        <description>Podcast Description There are some topics about which it seems no amount of data will change people&amp;rsquo;s minds: things like climate change, or restrictions on gun ownership. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot says that&amp;rsquo;s actually for good reason. As a general rule, she says, it&amp;rsquo;s better to stick to your beliefs and disregard new information that contradicts them. But this also means it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to change false beliefs. This week, we look at how we process information, and why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to change our views.</description>

Since that story aired, a solution seems even more out of reach. We wanted to play this episode again, because it offers something we don&amp;rsquo;t often hear in the news: empathy for the other side.

        <description>Podcast Description What would drive someone to take another person&amp;rsquo;s life? When researchers at the University of Chicago asked that question, the answer was a laundry list of slights: a stolen jacket, or a carelessly lobbed insult. It made them wonder whether crime rates could be driven down by teaching young men to pause, take a deep breath, and think before they act. We&amp;rsquo;ll go inside a program that teaches Chicago teens to do just that, and explore the research on whether this approach actually works.</description>

In response, many people are looking to the past, to see what history can teach us. But this process can fraught with psychological peril. On today&amp;rsquo;s Hidden Brain, we revisit a specific incident from World War II – the American decision to refuse entry to Jewish refugees aboard the SS St.</description>

Sociologist Arlie Hochschild felt this long before the rise of Donald Trump, and five years ago she went on a mission to understand the other side. She left her own liberal bubble in Berkeley, California for a conservative one, deep in the Louisiana bayou.</description>

We may love the pomp and circumstance, but there&amp;rsquo;s another, darker side to our psychology, too. Whether we like the new president or not, human beings have a strange and contradictory relationship with power and celebrity. We idolize the rich and famous, but also enjoy seeing them fall from their pedestals. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore this paradox: from Hollywood, to the White House, to the forests of Tanzania.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There is a replication &amp;ldquo;crisis&amp;rdquo; in psychology: many findings simply do not replicate. Some critics take this as an indictment of the entire field — perhaps the best journals are only interested in publishing the &amp;ldquo;sexiest&amp;rdquo; findings, or universities are pressuring their faculty to publish more. But this week on Hidden Brain, we take a closer look at the so-called crisis. While there certainly have been cases of bad science, and even fraudulent data, there are also lots of other reasons why perfectly good studies might not replicate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the early 1980s, a couple of researchers wrote an article in The Atlantic that would have far reaching consequences. The article introduced a new idea about crime and policing. It was called Broken Windows. The idea was simple: A broken window is a sign of a neglected community, and a neglected community is a place where crime can thrive. The researchers said, if police fixed the small problems that created visible signs of disorder, the big ones would disappear.</description>
