        <description>Podcast Description Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has a new problem. As well as fighting Russia, he also has to fight Israel and Hamas for the world&#39;s attention.
The shift in attention to Gaza has already meant Ukraine has lost crucial support.
The question is — can Zelenskyy get the world to care about Ukraine again? And if not, what will that mean for the war?

        <description>Podcast Description China&#39;s pandas are not just pandas. They&#39;re diplomats.
You&#39;re friendly to China? You get a panda. You criticise China? You get no pandas.
In recent years China has been hostile toward the West, with the most literal symbol of their displeasure being the withdrawal of their pandas from zoos around the world.
And yet, Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be having a change of heart.
This may indicate something very important — a return to a more peaceful relationship with the West.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The world&#39;s most famous artificial intelligence company, OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT — was set up to create a superintelligent AI, while at the same time safeguarding humanity from an omnipotent robot overlord which could enslave us all.
But last week the company fell into chaos. OpenAI fired its wunderkind CEO Sam Altman.
Just days later, under intense pressure, Sam Altman was put back in charge and the entire board was booted.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description China is using cash to try and shore up support in the Pacific.
In Honiara, the Solomon Islands capital, they just built most of the venues in the Pacific Games precinct.
And China is not alone. Like a geopolitical version of The Bachelor, China, Taiwan, Australia and the United States are all trying desperately to win Honiara&#39;s heart.
This tussle has caused panic in Taipei and Canberra, anger in Beijing and Washington, and actual violence in the Solomons.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As international sanctions have cut into North Korea&#39;s ability to import and export things, they&#39;ve become desperate for cash.
They&#39;ve been running crazy schemes to get it — smuggling, stealing, lying, cheating, swashbuckling — but that&#39;s nothing compared to what they make from stealing cryptocurrency.
In fact, most of their foreign currency now comes from stolen crypto.
So, can anything be done to stop the world&#39;s first nuclear-armed crypto bro, Kim Jong-un?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Israeli hostages Hamas took back on October 7th still have not been rescued.
The 1976 Entebbe rescue mission is legendary and gave Israel a reputation — they get hostages back no matter what.
Now this reputation is putting enormous pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to rescue the hostages again.
The question is — can he?

        <description>Podcast Description While Israel tries to defeat Hamas, they also have to worry about a much more dangerous paramilitary group on their northern border: Hezbollah.
The express purpose of Hezbollah, which formed 40 years ago, is also to eradicate Israel.
It would be a nightmare for Israel if Hezbollah swings in and backs Hamas up.
So where did Hezbollah form, why do they hate Israel, and what hand did Israel have in their creation?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Israeli Government has one of the most well-resourced intelligence communities in the world, specifically tasked with preventing attacks from Hamas.
So how did it fail to detect an operation that involved months of planning, meetings in multiple countries, and thousands of militants?

        <description>Podcast Description Last week, Hamas burst out of the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, the vast majority of them Israeli civilians.
But Hamas&#39; origins go back decades, to its founder Ahmed Yassin.
How did a disabled refugee from Gaza become one of the most influential men in Palestine?
And how did he take Hamas from obscurity to wresting control of the Gaza Strip?

        <description>Podcast Description In 2021, a doctor from Florida met with a group of men to plan the overthrow of the Haitian President.
The plot triggered a series of events which led to the President&#39;s death, the almost total collapse of the government, and the rise of mob rule in Haiti.
So why is Kenya now being sent in to save the day?

        <description>Podcast Description In September last year, Elon Musk refused to let the Ukrainian military use his Starlink satellites to attack Russia.
Musk jumped on Twitter and posted “Starlink is meant for peaceful use only”. So how did we get into a situation where Elon Musk gets to personally decide whether a Ukrainian military operation succeeds or fails?
And was he justified in refusing to help? Subscribe to If You&#39;re Listening on the ABC Listen app.</description>

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has just come out saying the Indian Government assassinated him.
India is, of course, denying it.
So who was Niijar? Why would anyone — much less the Indian Government — want to kill him?
And is there more to this story than meets the eye?

The debate over the naming of India stretches back nearly 80 years, and tells an important story about the country&#39;s history.
And Modi&#39;s new push for a change in the constitution is just the latest in a series of political fights centred on race, religion and unity in India.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For a century society has bullied and shamed people into trying to lose weight, without much result.
Now, a seemingly accidental discovery by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk may be the first weight loss drug that actually works.
People are hailing semaglutide, marketed under the names Ozempic or Wegovy, as a miracle weight loss drug — but it comes at a cost.
One clear winner is the Danish economy, as semaglutide has shot Novo Nordisk into the stratosphere as the most valuable company in all of Europe.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description China&#39;s economy is struggling. Similar things are happening across Asia but in China it&#39;s happening extremely fast.
And a big part of the reason why is the disastrous One Child Policy and years of dodgy population data.
How can you make plans for a country when you don&#39;t know how many people you have?
Now the population is going backward, the property sector is faltering, and China is in a world of trouble.</description>

TSMC chips have put Western tech companies and militaries streets ahead of China, and China is not happy about it.

        <description>Podcast Description Inflation in Argentina is at 100 per cent. The government is printing money fast and locals are spending in US dollars because the peso is so unreliable. The economy is like a rollercoaster.
It might be tempting to think, &#34;they&#39;re different over there&#34;, but here&#39;s the thing: they&#39;re kind of not. Argentina — one of the wealthiest countries in the world — was once uncomfortably similar to Australia. Until it totally lost control of its own economy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On 26 September, a series of underwater explosions destroyed a cluster of natural gas pipelines on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The pipes were designed to deliver gas directly from Russia to Germany, and the explosions exacerbated the already dire energy crisis in Europe.
Everyone agrees it was sabotage, but nobody can agree on who did it. Today: the mystery of the Baltic Sea bubbles, and the story of how Germany’s plan for peace-through-capitalism blew up in their face.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What does war look like on the ground, for the soldiers who go off to fight? What’s it like to be sent into the muddy confusion of a battlefield, asked to lay down your life for your country?
In this episode: two soldiers. A Ukrainian in his 50s and a Russian in his 20s. One of them is still on the battlefield. The other fought for a week, and is now serving a 15 year prison sentence.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Vladimir Putin&#39;s plan for a three day takeover of Ukraine relied on a quick strike to take out Volodymyr Zelenskyy - to kill him, to capture him, or to make him flee. Putin assumed that Zelenskyy was weak, but on the very first day of the invasion, two events showed that Putin was wrong, and led to the transformation of a man into a symbol of defiance against Russian tyranny.</description>

But this year he chucked that out the window.
His invasion of Ukraine has turned global security and the global economy upside down. In this episode we ask, why did he do it?

        <description>Podcast Description Australia is now in a race to build enough renewable energy to replace our coal fired power stations before they close. We’re in this situation because of a series of ignored warnings and missed opportunities over the last five decades.
Now, experts are telling us that the transition to a decarbonised economy presents a big opportunity for Australia. The question is - can we grasp it?

But lately whenever something catastrophic has happened to our energy supply, it’s been old technology at fault.
This is the story of a series of disasters that show how the system we’ve always relied on to deliver electricity is faltering.

        <description>Podcast Description For months commentators and politicians in Australia have been talking about one of the most frightening topics imaginable — a war between the United States and China over the island of Taiwan.
It&#39;s the last frozen remnant of a hundred year old Civil War — two governments both claiming to be the legitimate rulers of China, separated by 100 miles of ocean.
In this episode, we explain the bizarre story which led to the current tension, and look at what might happen next.</description>

Some feel isolated and discriminated against, others feel they are being treated as &#34;cash cows&#34; by a university sector desperate for their fees.
Can we do better? And can we handle it when problems arise inside the bubble we have created around Chinese students?</description>

But when Australia accused Huawei of being a security risk, a snowball began to roll which led to arrests, hostages being taken, and pure white hot fury in Beijing.

But where did the account come from? And what did it get wrong?
Over the past three months China, If You&#39;re Listening investigated the source of this description and found it was a previously undisclosed diplomatic cable from the Australian Embassy in Beijing, which subsequently had key details retracted.</description>

We told China we disapproved of their crackdown on students at Tiananmen Square in 1989, but continued to sell them iron ore.
Xi Jinping has made it clear that the arrangement has now changed, as he simultaneously takes the lessons Beijing learned at Tiananmen, and applies them to a crackdown on Muslims in his country&#39;s far west.</description>

But his rise to become the most powerful Chinese leader since Chairman Mao Zedong seems far more unlikely when you find out what Mao&#39;s policies did to Xi&#39;s family during his childhood.
In this episode we tell the story of Xi&#39;s — from its terrifying beginning to mysterious end — and ask if he is the catalyst for the deterioration of relations between China and Australia.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Russian intelligence agencies and Vladimir Putin have spent three years spreading a conspiracy theory that Ukraine was the one who meddled in the 2016 election.
The theory quickly reached Donald Trump, and he became obsessed with proving it.
He&#39;s now being impeached for his scheme to get Ukraine to investigate it.
While this scheme has blown up in Trump’s face, and allegedly harmed America and Ukraine’s national security, it has played out perfectly for Putin.</description>

But the origins are actually in the Ukrainian gas industry - which is deeply corrupt and reliant on Russia - just the way Putin likes it.
In 2014, Joe Biden flew to Ukraine to try and break their Russian gas addiction.
And started the dominoes falling which would eventually lead to Donald Trump&#39;s infamous request for a favour.</description>
