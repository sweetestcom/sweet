Then, through our 60s, 70s, and 80s, they are way above where we were in our youth. Why is this? Why do we get happier even as our bodies are falling apart?

In fact, the Buddha included delusion (aka: confusion about the way things really are) on his list of “the three poisons.” The whole point of meditation, per the Buddha, is to uproot delusion &amp;ndash; along with greed and hatred. Only then can you be enlightened. My guest today is here to valiantly make the case that delusion &amp;ndash; or self-deception &amp;ndash; has an upside.</description></item><item><title>Chris Bosh: Making Your Inner Voice Your Ally | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920416/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920416/</guid><description>Podcast Description One of the more surprising lessons I’ve learned as an ambitious person is that perhaps the best recipe for success is&amp;hellip; keeping your ego in check.

Instant gratification has never been more thoroughly scaled. You can order food, taxis, and shampoo from your phone. Streaming services autoplay the next episode of whatever show you’re binging. You can ask Siri or Alexa for the weather, the latest sports scores, or the dating history of Paul Rudd.

In fact, I’ve fallen into it many times. It’s this idea, which we can hold consciously or subconsciously, that meditation is a solo endeavor. “I’m doing it to reduce my stress, or boost my focus, or&amp;hellip; make myself ten percent happier.” All of that is fine. It’s actually great. But in my experience, the deeper you go into this thing, the more you see that the self is less stable and more porous than you previously imagined.</description></item><item><title>Concentration 101 | Bonus Meditation with Jeff Warren | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920423/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920423/</guid><description>Podcast Description Concentration is the backbone of meditation.

That’s why, starting today, we’re launching a special two-week series on hope: what it is, what it isn’t, and how and why to cultivate it.

He has been a long-time student of Sayadaw U Tejaniya (a well respected meditation teacher in Burma whose teachings have attracted a global audience), and his teaching emphasizes knowing the mind through a natural and relaxed continuity &amp;ndash; a style of practice that&amp;rsquo;s particularly useful during our crazy lives.</description></item><item><title>How to Understand Oneness | Roshi Norma Wong | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920451/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920451/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we’re diving into a concept that is simultaneously one of the oldest contemplative cliches and one of the most profound head scratchers — oneness. Can you be one with everything if you don’t really exist? And, even if we manage to grok this idea, what are the practical ramifications? Actually, this is just one of the many riddles and paradoxes we’ll be exploring today. My guest is Roshi Norma Wong.</description></item><item><title>How This Plague Ends (and What It Tells Us About Human Nature) | Nicholas Christakis | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920452/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920452/</guid><description>Podcast Description We all remember that fateful week, almost exactly a year ago, when it all seemed to sink in for so many of us–when Tom Hanks got sick, the NBA suspended games, and the (now former) President addressed the nation in primetime.

Sebene will help you make the most out of the process. About Sebene Selassie: Growing up, Sebene felt like a big weirdo. Born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and raised in white neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., she was a tomboy Black girl who loved Monty Python and UB40. She never believed she belonged. Thirty years ago, she began studying Buddhism as an undergraduate at McGill University where she majored in Comparative Religious Studies.</description></item><item><title>Uprooting Your Delusions | Andrea Fella | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920457/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920457/</guid><description>Podcast Description I know you guys, and it is pretty clear you love deep dharma episodes. Today we’ve got a dharma episode that is quite timely. As you all know, we live in a time when most people are getting their news from carefully curated information silos.

In so many aspects of your life, from planning your future to planning a meal to curating your social media, you need to be able to both envision and then execute. And how you work with your mind in these moments is key. Today, we are going to hear from a master creator &amp;ndash; the mind behind brilliant Pixar movies such as Inside Out, Up, and the recently-released Soul &amp;ndash; about how to run a creative process at the highest possible level.</description></item><item><title>Freedom Anywhere | Bonus Meditation with Joseph Goldstein | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920459/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920459/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this guided meditation (which you can do anywhere), Joseph helps you relax the habit of personalizing everything, so you can live with more ease.

This applies to classical addiction, and also to the less dangerous (but nonetheless nettlesome) unhealthy habits and compulsions that we all wrestle with. My guest today takes a very different approach. She aims to harness the pleasure centers of the brain as a way to handle addictive habits—and, controversially, she doesn’t believe you need to go cold turkey on alcohol, which is the main intoxicant she has targeted.</description></item><item><title>Your Craving Mind | Kevin Griffin | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920461/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920461/</guid><description>Podcast Description This is an episode about our craving, grasping minds. Whether you have struggled with a classic addiction or not, we all have addictive tendencies; we all wrestle with desire. I often think about a provocative question once posed by my friend, Dr. Jud Brewer, a Buddhist practitioner and addiction specialist: Are we all addicted? The implied answer is yes. My guest today thinks about addiction in a similarly broad and compelling way.</description></item><item><title>Forgive Yesterday and Reset | Bonus Meditation with Sebene Selassie | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920462/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920462/</guid><description>Podcast Description Sometimes we get stuck in yesterday’s mistakes.

The acronym is RAIN &amp;ndash; R-A-I-N &amp;ndash; and rather than explaining it myself, I will leave that to my guest, who has become one of RAIN’s primary proponents.

How do you feel about yourself when you are, say, in a judgmental or vengeful or jealous mode? Is that an opportunity for self-laceration? My guest today agrees with me that one of the healthiest possible inner moves is to learn how to hug your dragons, instead of attempting to slay them (which is only likely to make them stronger).</description></item><item><title>A Deeply Healthy Kind of Perfectionism | Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920467/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920467/</guid><description>Podcast Description We have talked a lot on this show about how perfectionism can have pernicious impacts on your psyche. Today we’re going to talk about how, by contrast, a certain kind of perfection is very much worth aiming for. We’re diving into another Buddhist list in this episode: the six paramitas, or the six perfections. These are six mental skills that you will never perfect, most likely. But simply working on them can confer massive benefits.</description></item><item><title>I Don’t Want to Meditate | Bonus Meditation with Matthew Hepburn | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920468/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920468/</guid><description>Podcast Description Is meditation the last thing you want to do right now?

He argues that we need to reconsider how we view intelligence. He says that instead of viewing intelligence as the ability to think and learn, we should view it as the ability to rethink and unlearn. My guest, whose name is Adam Grant, says there is evidence that, in a fast-moving world, what he calls the “critical art of rethinking” can “position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life.</description></item><item><title>The Buddha’s 8-Part Manual for a Good Life | Brother Pháp Dung | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920470/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920470/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today we’re talking about one of the Buddha’s first and most important lists: the Eightfold Path. I’m kinda surprised we’ve never done a deep dive into this list on the show before, but better late than never. Some context before we dive in: The Buddha, as many of you know, was a congenital list maker. His first and foundational list was the Four Noble Truths. This is the list that begins with “life is suffering” &amp;ndash; which is something of a mistranslation; it basically means that life will be unsatisfying if you are constantly clinging to things that will not last, given the nonnegotiable fact of relentless impermanence.</description></item><item><title>The Upside of Impermanence | Bonus Meditation with Joseph Goldstein | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920471/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920471/</guid><description>Podcast Description Take a moment to pay attention to the good things that are already here, and get in touch with the basic satisfaction of being alive.

But, speaking from personal experience, it is very possible, especially for Type A people, to approach meditation with an agenda. In which case, sitting on the cushion can be very far from truly doing nothing. Enter Jenny Odell, who makes a very compelling case for truly… doing… nothing. In her work, she is challenging what for many of us, myself included, is a deep-seated and sometimes subconscious reflex: to constantly optimize and constantly be “productive.</description></item><item><title>A New Way to Think About Your Time | Ashley Whillans | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920473/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920473/</guid><description>Podcast Description For many of us, in this pandemic, our relationship to time has become particularly fraught.

One of the many things I like about the Buddha is that, as far as I can tell, he pretty much always aims his messages, even the hard-to-swallow ones, at the pleasure centers of the brain. Even when he’s talking about ethics, which could come off as preachy or overly abstemious. Today, we’re going to talk about the Five Precepts.

A lot of men don’t talk about this stuff, but there is plenty of evidence that this is a unisex issue. Especially during the holidays, when we’re surrounded by treats and stress-eating because we can’t see our family, or we can &amp;ndash; and they’re making us crazy. This interview you’re about to hear changed my life.</description></item><item><title>Vulnerability: The Key to Courage | Brené Brown | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920487/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920487/</guid><description>Podcast Description Vulnerability is not something I ever personally considered to be a valuable skill to cultivate. That is, until I met today’s guest, Brené Brown&amp;ndash; who helped me understand that being vulnerable is not about weakness, nor is it about sloppy oversharing. Instead, she argues, vulnerability is about honesty, realness, risk, and courage. All qualities that are very relevant for these turbulent times in which we are living. Brené is a speaker, author, podcaster, professor, and researcher who has spent 2 decades studying vulnerability and courage, along with shame and empathy.</description></item><item><title>A Counterintuitive Remedy for Stress | Bonus Meditation with Sebene Selassie | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920488/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920488/</guid><description>Podcast Description Being kind to ourselves in hard times bolsters our resilience, so we can learn from setbacks rather than getting stuck in rumination. About Sebene: Born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and raised in Washington, D.C, Seb has been drawn to explore the intersection of different cultures. She was a self-professed &amp;ldquo;really bad dharma student,&amp;rdquo; until she was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer at age 34.

There’s a notion that is deeply ingrained in our culture that the only way to succeed &amp;ndash; or even to survive &amp;ndash; is to liberally apply an internal cattle prod. But there is research that strongly suggests that this approach simply leads to extra anxiety, and that there is a more successful approach, called self-compassion.</description></item><item><title>Manure for Enlightenment | Fleet Maull | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920490/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920490/</guid><description>Podcast Description The notion of transmuting the difficult stuff in your life into something positive has become a cliche. Turning lemon into lemonades, making your mess your message, etcetera. But, as I have said many times on this show, there is a reason cliches become cliches: they’re true. And it is extraordinarily helpful, in my experience, when someone can re-language and revivify an ancient truth that has been ground into platitude through rote repetition.</description></item><item><title>A Great Way to Get Out of Your Head | Bonus Meditation with Joseph Goldstein | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920491/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920491/</guid><description>Podcast Description Caring about others&amp;rsquo; well being actually enhances our own.

That phrase &amp;ndash; emotional intelligence &amp;ndash; entered the lexicon 25 years ago, when my friend Daniel Goleman wrote a book by the same name. And so on this episode, to mark the 25th anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence, we’re having Danny on the show. By way of background, he is a Harvard-trained psychologist who, along with other contemplative luminaries such as Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and others, went to Asia and discovered meditation in the 1960s, and then made it a huge part of their lives and careers.</description></item><item><title>A Meditator in the Arena | Sam Harris | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920493/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920493/</guid><description>Podcast Description Sam Harris (no relation to me, by the way &amp;ndash; although I wouldn’t mind it) has had a formative impact on my contemplative development. He was one of the first “normal” (at least that’s how I computed it, back when I was still a rather judgmental skeptic) people I met who was really into meditation, which gave me a lot of courage and inspiration to pursue the practice myself.</description></item><item><title>What is Happiness? | Bonus Meditation with Jay Michaelson | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920494/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920494/</guid><description>Podcast Description What is happiness?

Why? Why have these women been largely written out of history? And what do these hidden figures have to teach us? We’re diving in on that today with Pamela Weiss, dharma teacher in the Zen and Theravada traditions and author of A Bigger Sky.

I was looking for science-backed stress relief, not religion. But the more I learned, the more interested I became in the Buddha. He was, after all, not a god or a prophet.</description></item><item><title>Flipping the Stress Switch | Bonus Meditation with Jeff Warren | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920500/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920500/</guid><description>Podcast Description Release the grip of stress by playing with perspective, zooming in and waaay out, and feeling into the wild weather patterns of life.

Haemin Sunim is a Korean “mega monk” who has developed a massive online following and has written huge bestsellers. He’s also earned degrees from Berkeley, Harvard, and Princeton, and is the founder of South Korea’s School for Broken Hearts. In this conversation, we talk about how perfection resides only in your mind, how a celibate monk learned to give great relationship advice, and how he manages his own relationship to ambition.</description></item><item><title>How (and Why) to Hack Your Empathy | Jamil Zaki | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920505/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920505/</guid><description>Podcast Description Kindness and empathy are loaded propositions right now. When you hear those words, you might think: Eh, those are soft skills that won’t help me get ahead. Or: If I’m too nice, I will get trampled. Or: I need my anger to be effective. Or: I am plenty nice &amp;ndash; it’s other people who need to up their game. My guest today will push back on all of these reservations, and tell us how &amp;ndash; and why &amp;ndash; to, as he says, “hack your empathy.</description></item><item><title>Post-Election Uncertainty | Bonus Meditation with Oren Jay Sofer | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920506/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920506/</guid><description>Podcast Description During this wild moment of uncertainty, join Oren to ease your anticipation anxiety and soothe the troubling tumult of the unknown.

That’s the question we dive into today with Randy Fernando, who is featured in a new Netflix documentary called The Social Dilemma, which is all about the many alleged pernicious impacts of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et al.

I am confident that is not going to be the case with today’s guest. Brett Eldredge may be a big country star &amp;ndash; with six #1 hits &amp;ndash; but he is no dilettante when it comes to tackling mental health challenges.</description></item><item><title>The Opposite of Schadenfreude | Election Sanity Series | Tuere Sala | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920514/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920514/</guid><description>Podcast Description There’s an old expression: “Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little bit.” I love that saying, because it speaks to how hard it can be to take pleasure in other people’s happiness. That said, while it may be difficult, it is not impossible &amp;ndash; and moreover, as our guest today will argue, it’s a massively useful skill, especially as we endure this bonkers election.

This is a straight-up, meat-and-potatoes meditation talk from the one and only Joseph Goldstein. In this chat, we explore three profoundly useful mindfulness strategies, including: mindfulness of thinking, awareness of rushing (a deeply ingrained habit for many of us), and the genuine insight that can emerge from everyday activities. For the uninitiated, Joseph is one of the founding teachers on the Ten Percent Happier app; he is a cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society; and he is the author of several books, including the recently reissued The Experience of Insight: A Simple and Direct Guide to Buddhist Meditation.</description></item><item><title>The Immense Power of Giving a Crap | Election Sanity Series | Rev. angel Kyodo williams | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920517/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920517/</guid><description>Podcast Description Do you remember that band, The Shins? They had a popular song that appeared on the soundtrack for that Zach Braff movie Garden State. Anyway, they also had a song called “Caring is Creepy.” I always thought that was kinda funny. In this episode, however, we’re going to establish that not only is caring not creepy, it’s also not — as many people fear— a sign of weakness. Caring, or having compassion, for other people— or for yourself— is a baller move.</description></item><item><title>Reset Your Nervous System | Bonus Meditation with JoAnna Hardy | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920518/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920518/</guid><description>Podcast Description If you enjoyed this meditation, sign up for our Election Sanity Series email guide.

But our guest today is going to argue — convincingly, in my opinion — that fun is absolutely essential to a well-lived life.

But his story of finding the dharma &amp;ndash; and then trying to integrate it into his life &amp;ndash; is straight-up wild.

As my grandfather would say, “I resemble that remark.” We all know that belonging &amp;ndash; to a tribe, a family, a group of any sort &amp;ndash; is a key part of human happiness; science bears this out. But my guest today, Sebene Selassie, is taking this concept of belonging to a much, much deeper level.</description></item><item><title>Are We All Traumatized? | Dr. Pat Ogden | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920538/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920538/</guid><description>Podcast Description It’s a human urge to return to normalcy after a cataclysmic event. But if we rush back to normalcy without taking a beat, without metabolizing what we’ve all been going through, that can create profound psychological issues. Dr. Pat Ogden is an expert in trauma and a pioneer in what’s called “somatic psychology” (which I will let her explain). In this interview we talk about whether we’re all traumatized by what we’ve been through in recent months; the impact of trauma on the brain and body; how to handle and heal from our trauma; and we also branch out into her fascinating views on productivity.</description></item><item><title>How Not To Be Yanked Around By Your Emotions | Bonus Meditation with Joseph Goldstein | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920539/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920539/</guid><description>Podcast Description Joseph Goldstein is one of the most respected meditation teachers in the world &amp;ndash; a key architect of the rise of mindfulness in our modern society &amp;ndash; with a sense of humor to boot.

On the one hand, Buddhists tell us the self is an illusion: “You don’t exist!” On the other hand, they tell us, “Well actually, on some level, you do, of course, exist.” So which is it? The answer is: both. But this concept &amp;ndash; call it not-self, selflessness, egolessness, or emptiness &amp;ndash; doesn’t have to be some hopelessly esoteric riddle; it is actually a game-changer that we can all apply in our own lives.</description></item><item><title>Soothe Anxiety to Sleep | Bonus Meditation with Matthew Hepburn | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920548/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920548/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today (7/31) is the last day to join the Summer Sanity Challenge: a free 21 day meditation challenge.

But is this line of thinking sometimes taken too far — or simply misunderstood? Can we turn our desires — for food, sex, etcetera — into areas to apply our meditation practice? Today we’re going to explore that notion with Cara Lai. She is a mindfulness teacher, psychotherapist, and artist.

My guest is Rick Hanson, Ph.D., psychologist and author of the new book Neurodharma. We go into the deep end, yes, but we also get very down-to-earth, talking about how anyone, including you, can “reverse engineer enlightenment,” and have “Nirvana operationalized in your nervous system.</description></item><item><title>An Infinitely Portable Meditation Technique | Bonus Meditation with JoAnna Hardy | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920557/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920557/</guid><description>Podcast Description You can find meditations on relaxation and much more on our app. Visit tenpercent.com to download the Ten Percent Happier app and kickstart your meditation practice.

There are books on mindful parenting, mindful lawyering, even mindful sex. But what does the word even mean? And how do you actually do it? In one of his most famous and foundational discourses, the Buddha was said to have laid out, in great detail, four ways to establish mindfulness. In today&amp;rsquo;s episode we’re going to walk through these four &amp;ldquo;foundations&amp;rdquo; of mindfulness with Sally Armstrong, who started practicing in 1981, began teaching 15 years later, and now leads retreats all over the world.</description></item><item><title>Why We're All Suffering from Racial Trauma (Even White People) -- and How to Handle It | Resmaa Menakem | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920559/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920559/</guid><description>Podcast Description It’s easy to think of racism as a virus that lives in your head.

Race, we might tell ourselves, is an issue for people who have different skin colors than ours: black people, Hispanic people, Asian people, indigenous people, etcetera. But, of course, white is a racial category. (Important side note: race, for the record, is not a biological thing; it&amp;rsquo;s socially constructed.) Sadly, the white people who seem to have most clearly grasped that white is a race are white nationalists.</description></item><item><title>Waking Up to the Distortion of Racism | Bonus Talk with Zenju Earthlyn Manuel | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920572/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920572/</guid><description>Podcast Description If we were to walk past the fires of oppression, we would be walking past one of the widest gateways to liberation.

Owens is the author of the soon-to-be-released book, Love and Rage.

I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly grateful to my guest, meditation teacher Sebene Selassie, for agreeing to come on this show on short notice (like, two hours beforehand) to discuss such a painful subject. This episode is in response to the protests that have broken out nationwide in the wake of the case of George Floyd, a black man who died after nearly nine minutes with his neck under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis.</description></item><item><title>The Dalai Lama's Advice for Right Now | Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1439920575/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1439920575/</guid><description>Podcast Description How do we handle pandemic-induced anxiety or grief?

But as you will hear, she is anything but gloomy. Like all of the great meditation teachers I&amp;rsquo;ve met, she has a lightness and a sense of humor about her.
