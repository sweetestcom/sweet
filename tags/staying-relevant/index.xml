        <description>Podcast Description Sam &amp;amp; Pete are back! There&amp;rsquo;s no guest this week, but not for lack of trying!
We hear what the pair have done this week to Stay Relevant including panto requests, Love Island star launches, and sell-out calendars. Plus, we throw it back to Queuegate - is it the &amp;ldquo;Sidebar of Shame&amp;rdquo; moment of the year?
