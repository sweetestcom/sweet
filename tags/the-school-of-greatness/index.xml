Some people will tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not enough.
Others will say your ideas are unconventional and crazy - &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s never going to work!&amp;rdquo;
Maybe your own family doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in you.
The pressure from other people can be insane and paralyzing, but sometimes, we are our own worst enemies.</description></item><item><title>925 Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt on The Power of Forgiveness | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700628/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 21:32:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700628/</guid><description>Podcast Description Forgiveness is a gift.
Forgive and forget. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard this phrase at some point, but it&amp;rsquo;s way easier said than done.
We are all hurt at some point in our lives. Maybe a close friend has betrayed your trust, a family member ignored your hospitality, or a partner cheated on you. Sometimes, these conflicts end, and the other person admits their wrong and asks for forgiveness, but other times, they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>924 Let Go of Toxic Relationships | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700629/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700629/</guid><description>Podcast Description “You know energetically if someone is adding to or subtracting from you.”

So many people struggle with chronic illness or pain. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s back trouble, ringing in the ears, or headaches, we&amp;rsquo;ve almost all been in a situation when we know that something is wrong but we don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do and how to fix it.
Thankfully, we have doctors and health professionals to diagnose us, and they&amp;rsquo;re often right!

There&amp;rsquo;s always the pressure to become someone who you aren&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re comparing yourself to the people you see on social media. This is so easy to do.

You have the queen and king, obviously the most important pieces, and then on the other side of the spectrum, you have the pawns.
Pawns can&amp;rsquo;t do a lot. They have limited movement, and a lot of them get knocked over pretty early. There&amp;rsquo;s always the chance they could win the game, but that chance is pretty low.</description></item><item><title>917 Make an Impact and Next Level Success with Dean Graziosi | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700636/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 16:22:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700636/</guid><description>Podcast Description “I want to make self-education the new norm.”

Entrepreneur and podcaster Chris Harder invited me to a special Q&amp;amp;A at his Mastermind where I answered some questions about podcasting. Honestly, I get this question a lot, “What’s your advice on starting a podcast?”
&amp;hellip;And I tell most people&amp;hellip;they shouldn’t.

There is one guest I keep having on the podcast who is unlike any other.

Most of us don’t have unlimited budgets to market ourselves. So how can we compete with people who do? The answer is simple: we have to fascinate.

So often, we get a pat on the back when we run ourselves into the ground. We get recognition for always staying late at work. We answer emails at night and on the weekend.

It’s not about having a stress-free life- it’s about learning how to deal with it gracefully. Think of the last stressful moment you had. How did you react? Did you get angry and tense up? Or were you able to breathe and move through it? The more we work on our reaction when things go differently than we’d hoped, the happier we will be.</description></item><item><title>851 Sophia Bush on Speaking Your Truth | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700702/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2019 04:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700702/</guid><description>Podcast Description YOU TEACH OTHERS HOW TO TREAT YOU. Often, we don’t like how people talk to us. Whether it’s at home, at work, or with our friends, there are many times where we don’t get the respect we desire. It feels terrible.

People understand that there will be challenges and fear when they chase their dreams. But they’re not willing to be embarrassed. Are you willing to look like a fool? To go all-in and fail?

A lot of books about selling encourage you to act like someone you’re not. They tell you to say the other person’s name. Copy their body language. Become a salesman.

We all face a lot of pressure from the world. We’re constantly comparing ourselves to others on social media and getting critiques from friends and family. Whether it’s when to have kids, our relationship choices, or a nontraditional career, it’s hard to step outside the box. We might feel judged. We might feel alone.

There are two types of winners I’ve observed. Both of them have confidence.

How often have you heard phrases about putting family first? Most of us had a plaque on the wall growing up that said something similar.

We always make fun of dogs chasing their tails. It’s funny to watch- they spin and spin and spin trying to catch the impossible. They eventually flop onto the ground exhausted.

We often define ourselves by what job we do. I’m an accountant. I’m a teacher. I work in finance. But maybe we’re thinking about our careers in the wrong parameters.

Most of us know the parable of The Good Samaritan. It tells the story of an injured man at the side of the road. The priest crosses to the other side and ignores the man in need of help.

Ending relationships is never easy. But it’s a part of life. Not all relationships last, but it’s how we end them that makes all the difference. You can use the opportunity to plant seeds that better your future, or you can plant bitter seeds that will bloom into hatred and rage. You make the decision. It is possible to consciously uncouple. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Katherine Woodward where she explained the best way to end a relationship.</description></item><item><title>815 The Power of Storytelling | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700738/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 04:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700738/</guid><description>Podcast Description WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE MAGIC. Storytelling is an important part of everything you do. Whether you’re trying to sell something, speaking, or building relationships, you can’t ignore the power of story. It’s what causes us to have an emotional connection to something. Magic is an art form that uses storytelling. It’s not just about magic tricks. It’s about what you feel while you’re watching the trick. It’s about what the magician is telling you that changes your memory of the event.</description></item><item><title>814 Penn Jillette: Building the Longest Running Act in Vegas | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700739/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 04:33:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700739/</guid><description>Podcast Description THE HARDEST THING TO DO WHEN YOU GET OLDER IS CHANGE A HABIT. There is a Buddhist metaphor of the elephant and the rider. We are all riding an elephant. We think that we are in control. We have the reigns. But the elephant could overpower us at any moment.

Everyone has a story. You do. I do. Your life will be recorded. The question is, is your story the one that you want to be told? We often let other people write our pages instead of taking the pen and doing it ourselves. If you want your life to be a masterpiece, you’re going to have to live intentionally.

Love at first sight is bullshit. A relationship is like a castle. You find a plot of land that has a lot of potential. Then, bit by bit, you build the castle. But it takes work from both of you.

We all have an area of life we love spending money on. For me, it’s relationships. For you, it could be travel, food, wellness or something else.

They didn’t wait for someone to allow them to make videos- they just went out and did it. They’ve dealt with negative comments. They’ve had failed videos. They’ve faced countless setbacks. And they still continued to create.</description></item><item><title>778 Turn Your Creative Passion into a Thriving Business with Christina Tosi | The School of Greatness</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1372700775/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 04:42:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1372700775/</guid><description>Podcast Description YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP EVERY DAY.

So many of us hide who we truly are. We bury our shame thinking that if anyone knew we would no longer be accepted. But living this way keeps us from connecting with others.
