        <description>Podcast Description Are you your own worst enemy? There are going to be hundreds of obstacles that we face when trying to pursue greatness.
Some people will tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not enough.
Others will say your ideas are unconventional and crazy - &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s never going to work!&amp;rdquo;
Maybe your own family doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in you.
The pressure from other people can be insane and paralyzing, but sometimes, we are our own worst enemies.</description>

Forgive and forget. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard this phrase at some point, but it&amp;rsquo;s way easier said than done.
We are all hurt at some point in our lives. Maybe a close friend has betrayed your trust, a family member ignored your hospitality, or a partner cheated on you. Sometimes, these conflicts end, and the other person admits their wrong and asks for forgiveness, but other times, they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

So many people struggle with chronic illness or pain. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s back trouble, ringing in the ears, or headaches, we&amp;rsquo;ve almost all been in a situation when we know that something is wrong but we don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do and how to fix it.
Thankfully, we have doctors and health professionals to diagnose us, and they&amp;rsquo;re often right! But happens when the doctors aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what&amp;rsquo;s wrong or how to fix the problem?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You have the power to change your story. Have you ever felt like your life story was not your own?
There&amp;rsquo;s always the pressure to become someone who you aren&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re comparing yourself to the people you see on social media. This is so easy to do. We often just post the best of ourselves on the internet, and then the illusion is that everyone is living these perfect lives.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Don&amp;rsquo;t settle for being a pawn. If you&amp;rsquo;ve played chess before, then you&amp;rsquo;ll know there&amp;rsquo;s several different pieces in the game. You have the queen and king, obviously the most important pieces, and then on the other side of the spectrum, you have the pawns.
Pawns can&amp;rsquo;t do a lot. They have limited movement, and a lot of them get knocked over pretty early. There&amp;rsquo;s always the chance they could win the game, but that chance is pretty low.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Wealth without health isn&amp;rsquo;t wealth at all. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re the richest person in the world. You have anything and everything you could ever want. You&amp;rsquo;ve started companies, written books, gone on tours—you name it. But your body isn&amp;rsquo;t in the best shape. You&amp;rsquo;ve put it second to your career goals. And now, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to show.
Your health is a different kind of wealth. Taking care of your finances is important, but so is taking care of your body.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description NOTHING SHOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR STORY. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some pretty amazing women on The School of Greatness.

Male, female, old, young - we could all learn from this incredible businessperson. Not only is she the youngest self-made female billionaire in America (wow, right?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description CREATIVITY IS HARD WORK. Have you wanted to complete a project but stopped? You might have expected it to be perfect. Or maybe you thought you weren’t qualified enough to make it. You might have finished it but didn’t take the time to shape it into its final form. Completing something we’re passionate about is good for our wellbeing. But it’s not easy. Lin Manuel Miranda took six years to write Hamilton.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description OVERWORKING ISN’T THE GOAL. So often, we get a pat on the back when we run ourselves into the ground. We get recognition for always staying late at work. We answer emails at night and on the weekend. People ask us, “Wow, how do you manage to DO IT ALL?!” But what we’re really doing is destroying our minds and our bodies. We can only operate at 110% for so long.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description YOU HAVE TO LET GO. So many of us make decisions because we feel like we have to do something. Whether it’s the religion we grew up in, what our parents want, or what we feel is culturally acceptable, we often betray ourselves. But you can only live this way for so long before you start to break down. You’ll lose sight of who you are and suddenly realize you don’t know how to find it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description CHAMPIONS AREN’T SUPER-HUMAN, THEY’RE SUPER-INTENTIONAL. I’ve noticed that there are two types of champions. One of them wins and says, “I am the greatest that ever lived.” The other says, “All of the glory goes to God.” Both of these mindsets have good results, but is one better than the other? You need a certain amount of arrogance to be the best. After all, self-doubt is the biggest crusher of dreams.</description>

Whether it’s depression, low self-esteem, or something like erectile dysfunction, you need to be able to tell your doctor.</description>

In this new year, I want to challenge you to change the way you think about the things that scare you.

We take time to exercise and eat right. But the truth is, there is no magical destination. And even if we reach that place, it could all be destroyed in an instant by one of life’s famous curveballs. Instead of looking at balance like a happily ever after, look at it as something you constantly need to reevaluate and adjust.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description USE YOUR PAIN AS AN ARROW. None of us like to feel unpleasant emotions. Whether it’s pain, anxiety, or stress, we numb them with food, alcohol, and overscheduling. But there’s a lot we can learn from discomfort. Instead of drowning your feelings, get curious about them. Your envy can lead you to your passion. Your anxiety can show you your authentic self. And your pain might be asking you to comfort something in your past that is keeping you from your future.</description>

I used to avoid my feelings. I didn’t have the tools to process heartache and loss so I found another outlet: inflicting pain on the football field. But pain doesn’t just disappear- it will find another way of coming to the surface.</description>

We have to stop thinking of leadership as a destination. It is a journey where we listen, learn, and strategize with our teams, not for them.</description>

Replace negative thoughts with thoughts of love and compassion. That’s how we continue to grow and evolve. Our healing does not happen when we hide in the darkness.</description>

Stop thinking of business as transactional. Instead, be generous. Play the long game.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description BELIEVE IN SOMETHING GREATER. There are two types of winners I’ve observed. Both of them have confidence. But one winner, when asked how they did it, answers, “I am the greatest.” The other winner, when asked how they did it, answers, “God is the greatest.” Are you putting pressure on yourself to succeed or fail? Or are you putting your strength in something greater? Whether or not you consider yourself a religious person, know that you are not going through life in a vacuum.</description>

If you don’t like something, but you tolerate it, you can’t expect people to change. So how do we have better relationships with our families?</description>

But maybe we’re thinking about our careers in the wrong parameters. Instead of finding a job, we should be trying to find a way to feel excited and fulfilled every day. If you wake up with dread, you feel like you’re in a suit that’s too small, or you’re uninspired, you’re probably not in the right place.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description BE A CONSCIOUS SAMARITAN. Most of us know the parable of The Good Samaritan. It tells the story of an injured man at the side of the road. The priest crosses to the other side and ignores the man in need of help. The Levite does the same. The Samaritan, though, stops and cares for the man. But let’s zoom out a bit. Is there something we could do on a more global scale so that less men are left injured and uncared for on the side of the road?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description NOTHING HAPPENS EASILY. If you want to make real change in your life, you have to know it’s going to be uncomfortable. Everything has its process. You’re going to feel scared. You’re going to have growing pains. That’s part of being a human. But your ability to make mistakes and still stay true to your goals will determine whether or not you make it. You have to take it one step at a time.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE. We all have greatness inside us. That’s the whole reason I started this podcast. So why do we make ourselves smaller to fit in with everyone else? Why do we hide? Why do we make excuses? Why do we let others dim our light? By denying our destiny, we create disease, conflict, and unhappiness. Shine your light. It’s not always easy. When you embrace your greatness, others will attack you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description ENERGY FLOWS TO AND THROUGH YOU. We tend to minimize what we think we can accomplish. We put ourselves in a box. But we often think that other people can do what we can’t. Why do we believe in others more than ourselves? We all have infinite potential. But we let our “paradigm” define what’s possible. Let’s investigate all the ways your thoughts are holding you back from being happy, healthy, and wealthy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WHAT’S YOUR EXCUSE? We love to focus on why we’re not able to go after our dreams. Whether it’s our financial situation, our past, or the government, it’s much easier to blame an outside force than take responsibility. But what if there are no excuses? What if the only thing in your way is you? After all, you can’t change your circumstances. But you can change how you react to them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. We learn a lot of coping mechanisms when we’re younger. They help us get through tough times. But so many of us are still carrying around tactics that are no longer needed. They can make us defensive. They can prevent us from developing relationships. And they can hold us back from our goals. We need to “update our software.” Our situation has changed, but our brain has stayed the same.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT’S TIME TO TRANSFORM. At some point in our lives, we have let go of our old selves and grow into something greater. Think about the king cobra. It starts to feel uncomfortable in its skin. It’s not able to see- its skin makes its vision blurred. So it moves in seclusion. It gets rid of the old skin, and a new shiny skin comes up. Suddenly, its vision is clear.</description>

The Golden Rule isn’t always easy. Especially when you’re focused on yourself. But you can be the best and be good to others. It takes discipline. It takes mentorship. And it takes a commitment to what’s important in life. No matter what you’ve done in your past, you can always reinvent yourself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description CONSISTENCY IS KEY. So many of us diet. But we don’t maintain it. We start strong and then fall off. The reason? We don’t have a strong “why.” Wanting a six-pack isn’t enough. It has to be deeper than that. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Drew Canole where he shared how to find your ideal diet and stay consistent. Drew Canole is a Nutrition Specialist, Transformation Specialist and national spokesperson for the benefits of juicing vegetables for health and vitality.</description>

You can either be held back by the feelings of your past, or you can create the feelings of your future. Every thought you have affects every atom.

        <description>Podcast Description WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR DREAM? Are you giving all you’ve got? Or are you afraid to go all in? So often we give up before we’ve even begun. You are worthy of going after your dreams. You are worthy of fighting for what you want. You’ve got to commit to yourself so that you can succeed at the one thing you can control- your effort. For this Five Minute Friday, I’m doing a special solo episode where I share where I’m at in my journey to become an Olympic athlete.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THERE IS JUST CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS CONTENTS. When you’re dreaming, you don’t know that you’re asleep. You’re caught up in the dream. That’s how most of us go through life. We’re unaware that we’re not actually experiencing the things we are feeling. But you can break the spell in a moment with meditation. When you become present, you’re no longer asleep. It’s time to wake up. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I continue my conversation on meditation and mindfulness with one of the greatest thinkers of our time: Sam Harris.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description ALMOST ALL OF YOUR SUFFERING COMES FROM YOUR THOUGHTS. We all get stuck in the past. We worry about the future. We’re full of anxiety. It can consume us. And makes us ungrateful for what is happening now. In fact, you could say that the root of all our unhappiness is our thoughts. So how can we get more present? It’s not something that happens automatically. You have to practice every day.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description LIFE IS GOOD. Being an optimist instead of a pessimist is a choice. You can wake up each day and focus on what’s wrong. Or you can choose to be grateful. Whatever you focus on grows. So if you are spending your time on things that make you unhappy, they will take over. But if you can cultivate gratitude, simplicity, and optimism, that’s what your life will become. Choose happiness.</description>

How do you accomplish dreams even though you feel unprepared? It’s all about pushing past what you think you can do. You have to ask. And you need to surround yourself with people who will help you accomplish the impossible. The School of Greatness wouldn’t be what it is today without the help of my executive team.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description DO THINGS ON YOUR OWN TERMS. We all judge people. We make assumptions about what people care about and who they are based on the way they look. But people are often more than they seem. No matter what judgments people may have of you, you can break the status quo. Never let the way you look determine what you’re capable of. Keep questioning your judgements and make others question.</description>

If you’re confident without putting in the work, it can come off as arrogance or even insecurity. So how can you have calculated confidence? Learn from your mistakes. Put in the hours. And believe in what you’re doing. Once you’ve worked hard for your confidence, you’ll be able to look your clients in the eye knowing you’re an expert in your field.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description LIFE IS NOT A DRESS REHEARSAL. All of us are trying to do too many things at once. We’re on the phone while doing something else. We’re on a date but we’re distracted. We’re responding to text messages at red lights. When we live like this, we never fully experience anything. We’re half-living. It’s hard to build relationships, be joyful, and be open to opportunities when you’re not present.</description>

They’re sure of the path they’re on. But that’s not necessarily a good thing. I would have never thought I’d end up where I am now. My whole life I’ve been a generalist. I’ve never been the best at anything. There was always someone bigger, faster, and stronger.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Harvest seeds of growth. Ending relationships is never easy. But it’s a part of life. Not all relationships last, but it’s how we end them that makes all the difference. You can use the opportunity to plant seeds that better your future, or you can plant bitter seeds that will bloom into hatred and rage. You make the decision. It is possible to consciously uncouple. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Katherine Woodward where she explained the best way to end a relationship.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE MAGIC. Storytelling is an important part of everything you do. Whether you’re trying to sell something, speaking, or building relationships, you can’t ignore the power of story. It’s what causes us to have an emotional connection to something. Magic is an art form that uses storytelling. It’s not just about magic tricks. It’s about what you feel while you’re watching the trick. It’s about what the magician is telling you that changes your memory of the event.</description>

We think that we are in control. We have the reigns. But the elephant could overpower us at any moment. No matter how much we use our minds, our emotions ultimately are more powerful. This applies to the way we eat.</description>

We often let other people write our pages instead of taking the pen and doing it ourselves. If you want your life to be a masterpiece, you’re going to have to live intentionally. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with John Maxwell where he shared the gift that inspired him to live an intentional life.</description>

We’re balancing so many responsibilities. We don’t take time to quiet our minds so that we can start to understand what’s going on up there. That’s why meditation is so powerful. It allows you to get to the root of your problems instead of constantly fixing the symptoms.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description BUILD YOUR CASTLE. Love at first sight is bullshit. A relationship is like a castle. You find a plot of land that has a lot of potential. Then, bit by bit, you build the castle. But it takes work from both of you. One person can’t be laying the bricks while the other is home watching TV. After lots of hard work, you’ll have something unique and ornate that belongs to you.</description>

You could be super demanding and scary and get what you want. But is that the kind of life you want to lead? Probably not.

        <description>Podcast Description THE LESS YOU DO THE MORE YOU CAN RECEIVE. Take a moment to explore your habits. Do you glance at your phone during every free moment? Do you fill up your calendar with things that don’t add value? Do you spend your day working on a job that has no meaning for you? If so, your life is cluttered. Not just with stuff, but with noise. Quieting down and clearing out our schedule can be scary because it means you may have the space to face some tough questions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WIN? We can have our eyes on the prize. We can work every day to accomplish our goal. We can sacrifice and suffer to be the best. But at the end of the day, you can’t define yourself by whether or not you get “first place.” If your identity depends on one thing, you’re bound to fail. You have to free yourself from tying your worth to winning.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description BE THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR SHIP. As influencers, we don’t always accept that we are in control of our business. We depend on agents, our audience, or even chance to make decisions for us. But you have to get clear on your model. Reclaim your life’s agenda. Take back command of your ship. It’s the only way your business will scale. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I continue to explore what makes a successful career as an “influencer” with a top personal growth leader: Brendon Burchard.</description>

You have to care about the little details that other people let slide. And you have to have deep, unshakable confidence. A lot of what separates a player from a champion is mental. We can’t ignore the importance of keeping our mind away from the negative and focused on the end goal.</description>

We say, “How can I make thirty thousand more a year?” Instead, we should say, “How can make 300 thousand more a year.” You’ve got to unlock yourself from your budget mentality. Other people may not understand, but you can’t get knocked off course. If you’re destined for greatness, you shouldn’t settle for anything less.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description SPEND ON THE THINGS YOU LOVE. We all have an area of life we love spending money on. For me, it’s relationships. For you, it could be travel, food, wellness or something else. This is called your “money dial.” Once you figure out your money dial, you can spend intentionally on that rather than spending lots of money on everything. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Ramit Sethi where he shared about his concept of “money dials” and how to spend money on the things that bring you joy.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description LET&amp;rsquo;S PUT AN END TO SELF-HATE. Shame takes on many forms. We can feel shameful about our race, our gender, about aging, and so much more. Shame makes us stay small. What if instead of feeling shame about our insecurities, we celebrated every aspect of ourselves? What if we learned to think independently instead of listening to what the media says about us? To become the powerful confident person you are meant to be, you have to identify your shame and work hard to eliminate it.</description>

If you’re constantly putting yourself down and judging yourself, eventually you’re going to self-destruct. It’s common to self-sabotage when things are going well. It can happen to anyone- it doesn’t matter how successful you are. We feel anxious. We feel like a fraud. We might even feel like we don’t deserve it. But once you get to the root of those feelings, you can heal the judgments you have of yourself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo;S TIME TO PUT THESE SEX MYTHS TO BED. Having a healthy sexual relationship is important. But it’s not something we often talk about. Women’s satisfaction especially seems to take a back seat. So how can women get what they need in the bedroom? As men, we can ask questions. See what your partner is into. And understanding the science behind why women like the things they do are helpful, too.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description LEARN TO EMBRACE FAILURE. We often hold onto words. When someone gives us negative feedback, we can let it consume our minds. It’s not healthy. You can’t stop yourself from being offended by what someone says. But you can listen and be open to learning. Every time you mess up you’re making yourself better. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about making the most of opportunities and learning how to listen with one of the most successful actors of our time: Topher Grace.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description DO GOOD ALL THE TIME. Some people have an idea of giving that is not sustainable. You can’t self-sacrifice endlessly to help others. You also have to take care of yourself. Giving can be a win/win situation. In fact, it should be. Helping the world is only worth it if you are also helping yourself. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Will Macaskill where he shared this idea as one of his principles of effective altruism.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo; ALL ABOUT THE HUSTLE. What gatekeepers are holding you back from doing what you love? I’m inspired by the creators on YouTube. They are people who have forged their own path. They didn’t wait for someone to allow them to make videos- they just went out and did it. They’ve dealt with negative comments. They’ve had failed videos. They’ve faced countless setbacks. And they still continued to create.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP EVERY DAY. I’m not a distance runner. When I run, the first few minutes are easy. But after a mile, it starts to hurt. I can either stop there, or I can keep going. When I push through the adversity, I feel like I can run forever. I hit the zone where it doesn’t hurt anymore. The same thing happens in life. You have to keep giving it your best even when it’s hard.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THERE IS ORDER TO THE CHAOS. What is this place? Are we even really here? Is there a higher power that created us, or was it a random explosion? These are some big questions. But the odds of life actually existing are insane. Everything would have had to had come together so perfectly. It’s hard for people to wrap their minds around, but we need to admit there is so much about the universe we don’t understand.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description YOU&amp;rsquo;RE ONLY AS SICK AS THE SECRETS YOU KEEP. Five years ago, I made my first post opening up about my childhood sexual abuse. It was the best thing I could have done. My life became a billion times better when I started to share my shame. I was able to sleep through the night. I connected to other people. And I was able to give and receive love.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THOSE WHO SAY THEY CAN AND THOSE WHO SAY THE CAN&amp;rsquo;T ARE USUALLY BOTH RIGHT. Any time you try to do something great, there are going to be critics. That’s impossible. That’s crazy. You’ll never be able to do that. But the biggest doubter is often yourself. How can we master our minds and quiet our fears when we are striving for greatness? It’s about pushing past our limits and tapping into a flow state.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description REJECT APATHY. There is suffering happening all over the world. We all can do something. Children can be a great example. When you see a kid give up what little allowance they have to help someone else or set up a lemonade stand, you realize that what you’re able to give is enough. We can’t just turn a blind eye. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Scott Harrison where he talked about living a life of giving.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description PRESSURE ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. What makes one business succeed and another fail? The most important element is the entrepreneur. If you watch the show Shark Tank, you know that people get investments from sharks just by being a passionate salesperson. It’s about going all in. So how can we ensure that what we put our time and money into will be unstoppable? We have to learn from the people who are at the top of their game.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description DIE YOUNG AT AN OLD AGE. How many fad diets have you tried? There’s a reason that they don’t work. Health and diet are not one-size-fits-all. We all have a special set of genes that tell us what foods we need. But it’s more than your genes. Doctor’s will ask you if you have a history of a disease in your family. That’s because you not only share the same genetic make-up, you probably eat the same way.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description YOUR FALSE HUMILITY IS HURTING YOU. We all can struggle with taking money in return for our services. It’s hard to ask for what you need. My father sold life insurance. He taught me a lot about not being ashamed of selling something that adds value to another person’s life. That’s why, for this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with my brother Christian Howes about how artists can set themselves up for financial success.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo;S TIME TO DIGITALLY DECULTTER. Very few of us have the courage to be alone. When we are quiet and don’t distract ourselves, we have to face hard questions. It can be scary. Instead, we reach for our phones. We might be trying to fill a void, or we might just be addicted. Technology is a lot like processed food. We want more and more, but we’ll never be satisfied.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THE TWO THINGS AT WAR IN A MAN ARE LOVE AND LUST. People today are struggling in relationships. With social media, there are so many options. Everything looks fresh and new and interesting. Why would anyone be happy with just one person? But when you’re constantly searching for the next best thing, you feel empty. You lack peace and satisfaction. And you miss out on what life is all about: love.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description VALIDATION IS REDUNDANT. As many of you know, I didn’t have friends growing up. I couldn’t read and write until late high school. I was goofy and gangly. I got made fun of all the time. Sports was something I could finally understand. I was able to prove myself by what I could accomplish on the field. But then I placed my self worth in what I could achieve in football.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo;S OK TO NOT BE OK. So often we feel like we have to mask what we are going through. We hide our fears. We cover our scars. But the adversity you face makes you a stronger person. You’re not the only one who is battling something. The more vulnerable you can be about what you’re up against, the more other people will be able to support you. It’s going to take a team effort.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “WHY” IS NOT AN EVOLUTIONARY QUESTION. Growing up, I had more imaginary friends than real friends. I would play games with myself to keep myself happy. I was very lonely. I felt insecure. But as I got older, I was able to find meaning and purpose. That allowed me to feel connected to the people around me. We need to have hope and meaning. It’s what makes us human.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description THERE&amp;rsquo;S A BIGGER STORY. When I started my book tour, people were always asking me, “How are you going to stay humble?” It’s not easy. When you start getting recognition, it can go to your head. But you can’t share your message if you don’t believe in yourself. It’s a balance. You need to be confident but also know that it’s not all about you. You are a part of the story, not the whole thing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU CAME FROM. The way you were raised still has effects on you today. It’s not that you should blame your parents. They did the best they could. But you should be aware of how your current actions reflect the truths you learned growing up. Growing up, my parents were raising four kids and working multiple jobs. I always felt invisible. I know that a lot of what motivates me today stems from those feelings of not being seen.</description>

If you’re dating or married, do you treat that other person with respect? Do you listen to them and value them? Finding the right person isn’t the end of the story.</description>

It takes energy and intention to figure out what’s actually in our food. But making the effort to understand the ingredients we put in our body will help us take our life to the next level. So why is it so hard? The food industry is doing everything they can to keep chemicals in their food in order to increase shelf-life and keep you wanting more.</description>

Maybe I’m not the person for the job. Your self-belief has to be airtight if you want to go all the way. It has to be unwavering. Once you believe in yourself authentically, you will get others on board who believe in you, too.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description SWEAT MORE IN TRAINING SO YOU&amp;rsquo;LL BLEED LESS IN WAR. The nineties were a difficult time for me. But I believe that I experienced that to give me the motivation to do what I’m doing today. A rich life greatly lived is one that is also filled with challenges. I want you to know that no matter what you’re going through, there is richness on the other side. Take your wounds and turn them into wisdom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “PROGRESS IS THE SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE.” - DE CHARDIN What do you believe in? We all agree that certain things are wrong. We’re constantly redefining what it means to treat each other with compassion and respect. So what is it that’s inspiring us to change? You might think that it’s random. But maybe there is a force behind it all. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with author, speaker and former pastor Rob Bell where he talked about why he believes in God.</description>

So many of us are afraid to even admit to ourselves what we really want. But if you write your dreams down, magic happens. You’ll be shocked at how they will make themselves into reality. Write them down. The best kind of dreams, though, are the ones that will help others.</description>

I’ll just pay for it later.” Advertisements tell us to spend, spend, spend. What if, instead, you became allergic to debt. I’m lucky that my father taught me the importance of savings and investing.

But men feel like they’re emotional prisoners. They are committing suicide at much higher rates. They are the ones performing mass shootings. They are reacting in violence. We have to allow men ways to process their past and to express their emotions in order to become the people they are meant to be.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description STOP PLAYING SMALL. So often we are afraid to go all in. Whether it’s in a relationship, in business, or in an investment, the fear of failure keeps us from fully committing. What a mistake. I’ve had to learn to love failure. I have to consciously tell my brain, “You’re going to fail. And it’s going to be ok.” Take the leap. Make the commitment. Dare to take a stand.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WHAT YOU SAY TO YOURSELF MATTERS. The more you say things, the more you believe them. You have to tell yourself you will succeed. Write it down every day. Say it looking in the mirror. People may look at you like you’re crazy. But the more you say it, the more they’ll start to believe it, too. You will not get to where you want to go if you don’t believe in yourself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description TRANSFORMATION IS A ROLLER COASTER. It’s that time a year where a lot of us commit to making changes in our lives. But sticking with resolutions is hard. Very few of us are consistently committed to ourselves. It is not easy. We have to think of new habits like a roller coaster. We’re building momentum to making the change. But then the roller coaster goes down. The dip is normal.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description DO THE UNEXPECTED. Do you go the easy route? The expected route? Or do you find your own path that compliments your unique passions? Finding your own way takes inner strength. You won’t be able to do it without believing in yourself. It takes a special person to defy expectations and break into a new field. People will doubt you when you do something unexpected. That’s a given. It’s how you respond when people try to dissuade you will determine if you’re successful or not.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “You have a right to your actions, but never to your actions’ fruits.” - Bhagavad Gita It’s a time of year where we focus on giving. We give gifts, we give back to our communities, and we give to charities. So what does it mean to give? And why is it important? Giving is not just a nice thing to do, it’s critical to your wellbeing. We are all connected- the more you give to others, the more you help yourself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description WHAT STORY ARE YOU TELLING YOURSELF? Whatever it is, you’re creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. You’re projecting your story onto everyone around you without even realizing it. That’s why mentalists are so successful- they suggest a story to you that you accept as true. Whatever your way of thinking, it doesn’t have to stay that way. You can be free of your own story. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk with someone who changed his own way of thinking to become an incredible illusionist and mentalist: Derren Brown.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description TAKING CARE OF MENTAL HEALTH IS POWERFUL, NOT WEAK. It’s time to open up. No matter what you’re dealing with, you’re not alone. There is nothing shameful about having anxiety. Think about this acronym for FEAR- you either Fear Everything And Run or Face Everything And Rise. The more you confront the things in your past you don’t want to do with, the more you’ll be able to move forward.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description EMPOWER OTHERS TO SHINE. How often to tell the people around you what you love about them? Sometimes it feels easier to criticize. But this isn’t the path to creating an amazing team. Even if it’s uncomfortable to tell people what they’re doing right, it’s important. Like everything else, it’s a practice. Practice acknowledging others, and own the acknowledgment given to you. You’ll be amazed by how it changes your life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description TRUE SELF-LOVE IS THE KEY TO LIFE. Are you insecure and in resistance to yourself? It’s such an exhausting way to live. Instead of feelings of self-hatred, start to view everything you don’t like about yourself as a gift. Why? Because once you start to love yourself, you can begin to love others. It sounds like a cliche. But it’s the truth. Self-love is a truly powerful practice. When we start to work on our inside, the outside starts to fix itself.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description HUMAN CONNECTION IS THE MOST POWERFUL. We have thousands of “friends” on social media. But how many people could you actually call in a time of need? Technology is becoming a larger and larger part of our life, but it’s causing us to be more isolated. We have to work hard to continue to build actual human connections. Otherwise, life has no meaning. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about all the ways that technology is affecting us in the workplace with a friend who has done tons of research on the subject: Dan Schawbel.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description YOUR NEED FOR CONTROL CAN HURT YOU INSTEAD OF HELP YOU. A mental disorder is like an unhealthy relationship. You have to love yourself enough to know that you deserve better. Otherwise, you’re depriving yourself of living a full, abundant life. But it’s not easy. Admitting that you or someone you know is struggling with an eating or mental disorder is scary. That’s why, for this Five Minute Friday, I brought back a powerful conversation I had with Lindsey Stirling where she shared her journey to overcome her eating disorder.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR SUPERPOWERS. All of us have superpowers. They are the things that come easily to us. You have to find your superpower and then use it to change the world. Why is it so important? Because once you are coming from a place of passion, the rest will follow. People who lead with a desire for money or fame won’t have the same impact. It’s all about your intention.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description CHOOSE THE PATH OF MOST RESISTANCE. Do you avoid challenging yourself? If you do, you’re cheating yourself of reaching your full potential. There is so much you can learn through pain. But we want to avoid it. We want to stay in our comfort zone. Growth, though, is found in the discomfort zone. You have to have the courage to face sickness, disappointment, and discomfort. That’s why I’m so excited to share this conversation I had with someone who has mastered the art of using pain as a way to better himself: David Goggins.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IT&amp;rsquo;S TIME TO GET THE ROOT OF YOUR HEALTH PROBLEMS. Are you constantly feeling like crap? You don’t need to live like that. The food that you put in your body has a lot to do with how well you function. Your body is incredible in how it can heal itself when you change your habits. Not only do we need to work on our personal health, but we also need to be aware of how our country’s policies affect our nation’s health.</description>

The more you can learn about how the human mind works, the more you can be aware of how your actions influence others. It’s so much more than just the words that you speak. The energy that you bring into a room and the attitude you have towards life has a huge effect on the people around you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description SOMETIME SAVING SOMEONE ELSE WILL SAVE YOU. Even the most successful people can struggle with self-esteem. You won’t be able to share your gifts with the world if you don’t feel worthy. Often, finding a cause we believe in can cause us to figure out who we are and what we stand for. Be empowered to make a choice you believe in. That’s why I am so grateful to share a conversation I had with an actress who has found meaning by taking a stand on Animal Rights: Alicia Silverstone.</description>

The same works for addiction. You have to have a system in place to help you overcome it. You can’t just hope that you’ll make the right decision when you’re faced with it. It all starts in the morning. Meditation, gratitude, and breathing can help you get in the right mindset.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description FIND THE WINNING BALANCE. You hear so often that people get to the top of the mountain and realize that the summit isn’t the answer. To be a champion, you have to know that there is so much more to success than a final outcome. If you focus on the goal without being connected to your joy and larger purpose, you will get burnt out. But when you’re coming from a place of passion, the results will fall into place.</description>

You need to work out your mental health just as often as you work out your physical health. Meditation is basically a bicep curl for your brain. When you meditate, you’re training your brain to come back to the present moment over and over again. It’s scientifically proven to alter your brain waves.</description>

But is that what you’re best at? If a rabbit is trying hard to be a frog, it may make a decent frog. But it would be a much better rabbit. To be successful, you have to combine your natural talent with hard work. Even the most dedicated football player can’t make it to the NFL without innate skill.</description>

We can get caught up in the comparison game: who has the most money, the bigger house, the best car. It’s never-ending. At the end of the day, what kind of legacy does that leave? If we can have a cause that is greater than ourselves, we can find purpose.

        <description>Podcast Description When you feel like you’ve reached your limit, you’re only 40% there. How often do you listen to your body when it says, “I’m done?” We get tired, our muscles get sore, so we throw in the towel. We’re wired to stop every time we start to feel pain. But if we ignore that, we can push ourselves to a new limit. Unless you get uncomfortable, you won’t know what you’re really capable of.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “THERE’S A HUGE AMOUNT OF REAL STATE BETWEEN THE WORST AND THE GREATEST.” Do you care about getting your social media numbers up? Do you want people to love and adore you? The problem is that you’re focusing in the wrong direction. Don’t concentrate on yourself or what you want from other people. Shift your focus to helping others. Make an impact on those who already appreciate you. When that happens, more people will appreciate you.</description>

From being who you are, and all of the experiences you went through. This world, and finding your place in it, is all about you being you and trusting in your instincts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “CULTIVATE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO TELL YOU YOU THE TRUTH.” Whether you want to admit it or not, you have an ego. Everyone does. We tend to put a bad connotation on it, but in truth a little ego is healthy. Ego can be confidence about yourself and what you do. It can be a challenge if you become successful, because people become afraid of telling you the truth and pointing out your flaws.</description>

They may have been when we were kids or adults. They may have affected just ourselves or many people around us. But it&amp;rsquo;s likely we remember doing them because we regret them. This is something that&amp;rsquo;s not easy to talk about. But there&amp;rsquo;s something really valuable in recognizing the parts of ourselves that are capable of doing things we regret.</description>

I’m sure you have your own stories. Being a victim doesn’t end with the event. It continues on for a lifetime. In the end, you have no control over what happened to you. There’s no going back. What you do have control over is the decisions you make on the other side &amp;ndash; how you let these tragedies affect you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “RESISTANCE IS WHAT BLOCKS US FROM RECEIVING SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE.” There’s so much happening in the world right now. One thing we can’t do is give in to the fear. Instead, give in to love. Give support, passion, and nothing but love to everyone you meet. For this 5 Minute Friday, I decided to refer back to an older episode of The School of Greatness with Gabby Bernstein. Gabby is a NYT bestselling author, she’s regarded by Oprah as one of the emerging spiritual leaders of our time, and she is a powerhouse force of love and healing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “UNLESS YOU CLAIM EXTRAORDINARY, ORDINARY CLAIMS YOU.” Your mindset is one of the most powerful tools you have. In fact, it’s so powerful you may not even realize how much it affects you every day. When you show up with a lot of energy, excited, and ready give fully you will energize everyone around you. When you show up with no energy and sluggish, you’ll zap the energy out of everyone in the room with you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “FOOD IS MEDICINE. IT WORKS FASTER, BETTER, AND CHEAPER THAN ALMOST ANY DRUG.” I know how hard it is to eat a healthy diet. It requires time and energy that you often feel like you don’t have. But what if I told you the time and energy you think you don’t have is because of the food you’re currently putting into your body? It&amp;rsquo;s easy to be skeptical about this idea.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “Let your personal experience tell you whether your belief is still valid or something has to change.” One of the most important things you can do is keep your beliefs elastic. This gives your mind the freedom and room to grow if it wants to adopt new principles. For those who lock into a set of beliefs, they close themselves off to outside influence. When you do this, your mind stops growing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IF WE’RE FEELING SCARED, IT&amp;rsquo;S OUR EGO TALKING. We are holding onto some form of identity, and we’re meeting something that challenges it. Our ego tells us to get that thing away from us. But once you realize that it’s your ego talking and not you, then you can face it head-on. Keeping the wide-angle on your life to be able to see this in real time requires a unique type of self-care.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO MAKE EXCUSES. You want to be better, but you also want to stay in your comfort zone, so you tell yourself a story explaining why it’s okay to stay where you are. How to reverse this habit is to start recognizing these stories as the root of all failure. When you do this, you start to notice how your excuses are holding you back.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &amp;ldquo;THERE’S A HIDDEN BLESSING IN EVERYTHING WE GO THROUGH IN LIFE.”
Running your own business can be one of the hardest things on you mentally. It’s a very masculine dominated world, and there’s often times not enough love.
I often notice I’m being hard on myself, especially when things go wrong.
All of this got me thinking about the important words I received in the past from Sara Blakely.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description IF I WERE AFRAID OF STEREOTYPES, I WOULD NEVER BE WHERE I AM TODAY. I know that transformation and change is one of the hardest (and scariest) things you can go. Change is the only way that you can truly grow. As a person, in relationships, and even in business. The best way to transform is to constantly focus on doing better than you previously did. As you push yourself further and further, a little more each time, you&amp;rsquo;ll become much more confident in yourself and your abilities.</description>

We only have so much attention we can give out. To people, to goals, to anything. As a result it&amp;rsquo;s important to have that strong foundation.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the naysayers because they don&amp;rsquo;t understand your passions. If you feel yourself being pulled to something, and excitement fills you when you do it, then follow that path.</description>

Breaking out of that comfort zone and continuing to grow is the difference between being average and being great.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &amp;ldquo;If the last day of my life came, and people were sitting around me, I would say ‘Smile, because I made it to the other side.’” - Ray Lewis I constantly think about the fact that the only definite thing in this world is what we leave behind. Money comes and goes, belongings eventually break or get thrown out, but what people say about you will never change. This got me thinking about an amazing episode I did with Ray Lewis.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description HOW YOU START AND END YOUR DAY MATTERS. I get a lot of questions from listeners about what my morning routine, daily habits and nighttime routines look like. So I decided it was time to record a solo episode answering this exact question so that anyone who asks can get a quick answer :) The truth is, I believe that healthy, consistent routines make a massive difference in our daily performance and our long term health and happiness.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &amp;ldquo;WHAT’S THE POINT OF GOING AFTER ANYTHING THAT&amp;rsquo;S REASONABLE? THAT’S NOT GRATIFYING.” I used to believe that money was the answer to happiness. When you spend all of your time chasing the dollar, it bring you emptiness. The real reason to chase after money is so you can have the freedom you need to experience life’s beautiful moment. Chasing the endless dollar is just as bad as being stuck in a cubicle all day.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description &amp;ldquo;SUCCESS IS EASIER THAN PEOPLE THINK.&amp;rdquo; I used to think that being a billionaire meant you had to be super smart, super cool, or even superhuman. None of these things are true. If you want to be a billionaire you have to be passionate, enthusiastic, and dedicated. That’s all. When you persevere past the point when most people give up, you’ll find that there’s not much competition at the top.</description>

Previously, he gave great advice on how to leave the right first impression, and most importantly it’s not made through what we say. So little of the impression we give off is through our words. Our body language, says so much more than anything that comes out of our mouths.</description>

I was judging everything I did right, and everything I did wrong.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “CREATING BOUNDARIES IS NOT ABOUT CREATING A WALL, IT&amp;rsquo;S CREATING AN AGREEMENT.” There’s a lot going on in this world lately, with relationships being violated. We’re seeing it daily with the #MeToo movement, and so many people in Hollywood coming forward. Problems aren’t just occurring in intimate relationships, but in business, family, friendships, and so on. Almost all of this stems from boundaries being crossed. Boundaries are something that we all need to create and stand by.</description>

On a previous episode, we were joined by JJ Virgin, who gave me some great advice on how we can all change our mindset.
