        <description>Podcast Description Fr. Mike explains why Joel would say that there are certain times for war, even within God&#39;s plan. In a broken world, we are sometimes going to be called to fight the brokenness around us, but we must believe that God is allowing this not because he likes war, but because something better will come in its place. Today&#39;s readings are Isaiah 16-17, Joel 3, and Proverbs 10:21-24.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Fr. Mike emphasizes the importance of knowing God and knowing his love for us as we read about the devastation of war and the lack of faith displayed by Israel.

        <description>Podcast Description Fr. Mike explains why Joel would say that there are certain times for war, even within God&#39;s plan.

Today&#39;s readings are Isaiah 16-17, Joel 3, and Proverbs 10:21-24.</description>
