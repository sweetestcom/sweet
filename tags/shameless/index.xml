We get her onto the show to ask her about the finite details of a social media presence that demands engagement of young girls. PLUS!

Contestant Natasha not-so-subtly hinted to spending &amp;ldquo;two nights&amp;rdquo; with old mate Justin Bieber, but she&amp;rsquo;ll be damned if she tells us much more. So what&amp;rsquo;s the deal with water-tight NDAs around both sex and abuse?

Yes, it’s royal wedding week and we’ll be damned if we aren’t spending (almost) the whole show on it.

Yeeeep, we’re interviewing former Bachelor star Jen Hawke - also known as Australia’s favourite reality TV villain - about the power of the producer. Can a reality TV producer create a villain, we ask her, or do they need something to actually play with in order to craft their character?</description></item><item><title>Going deep on Khloe Kardashian and 'Third Trimester Tristan' | Shameless</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5371970557/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 01:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5371970557/</guid><description>Podcast Description OH MY GOODNESS. This week we obviously needed to debrief on the Khloe Kardashian/Tristan Thompson cheating saga. We went deeeeeep (and got a little fiery with each other along the way) on how much sympathy should we have for Khloe, and the men like Tristan who just can’t keep it in their pants. Also: we cover the cultural phenomenon that is Coachella, and the musical phenomenon that is Cardi B.</description></item><item><title>Celebrity divorce and the great Instagram lie | Shameless</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5371970558/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 01:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5371970558/</guid><description>Podcast Description Well, it’s been a big week in the world of celebrity divorce after Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced their “loving” split to the cries of love being dead. So why is it we feel so viscerally about break-ups like this? Is it because we feel we’ve being sold a lie about what a relationship and a break up looks like? Plus, a radio host’s orgasm story that was a little bit too much to stomach and the atrocity that is Meghan Markle daring to have a grey hair.</description></item><item><title>Georgia Love is tearing the whole thing down | Shameless</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5371970559/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5371970559/</guid><description>Podcast Description HELLO!

Welcome back. Bachelor in Paradise started this week, so naturally, we took it upon ourselves to debrief all about the show&amp;rsquo;s premiere. Michelle thinks Davey and Flo will be the first to have sex, Zara thinks she&amp;rsquo;s wrong and mostly, we talk a whole lot of crap about a show that&amp;rsquo;s just a whole lot of crap. Loveable crap, that is. We also deep-dive the return of Britney Spears - considering she randomly re-surfaced in our news cycle TWICE this week - and discuss the media&amp;rsquo;s troubling response to a story about Robin Williams and his larrikin antics on the set of Mork &amp;amp; Mindy.</description></item><item><title>Katy Perry kissed a boy and we didn't like it | Shameless</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/5371970561/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 05:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/5371970561/</guid><description>Podcast Description Oh hey there!
