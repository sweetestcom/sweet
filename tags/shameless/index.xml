Sure, she’s alone for the first time in her life, can’t afford her rent and her obscure PhD is going nowhere, but she’s reaaaally good.</description>

Hiya, book clubbers! This month, we read You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty by Akwaeke Emezi. This is a book that flips the romance genre utterly on its head. It’s been five years since protagonist Feyi lost her husband in a car accident. Feyi isn’t ready for anything serious, but a steamy encounter at a rooftop party cascades into a whirlwind summer she could have never imagined: a luxury trip to a tropical island, decadent meals in the glamorous home of a celebrity chef, and a major curator who wants to launch her art career.</description>

Happy Saturday, book clubbers!
This month, we tucked into Swing Time by Zadie Smith, a novel that tells the story of two girls growing up on the wrong side of London. They meet at a community dance class and dream of being dancers, but only one of them has the talent. The blurb told us it was a tale of “friendships that anchor us, define us and change us forever”, but do we feel that line adequately explained what the book was about?</description>

This month, we read Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi - a novel that centres around Gifty, a neuroscientist at Stanford who studies addiction and depression neural circuits through experimenting with mice. This, we come to learn, is no coincidence. Transcendent Kingdom deals with grief, mental illness, and religion, and also takes us back through Gifty’s life: From her brother’s opioid addiction to a disappearing father to being sent to Ghana to live with her Aunt while her mother battles depression at home.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hey friends! Happy New Year! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed some much-deserved time out with your loved ones.
Today we are re-sharing one of our favourite episodes of 2019 - our In Conversation episode with Natalie Fornasier. We first came across Natalie and her story when she sat down with Byrdie.com.au in 2018 for a piece titled “I’m 24 and Living With Advanced Melanoma—This Is My Story”. Natalie’s words and insights in that interview were what informed our very last segment of Shameless in 2018, and what pushed us to change our own relationship with sun tanning forever.</description>

Em is known as the girl who fell from the sky: at just 20 years old, when skydiving in Switzerland, her parachute failed to open properly.

As she documented her recovery and her re-birth (as she now calls it) Emma built a hugely loyal following thanks to her sunny and warm and thoughtful posts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hello! Happy Thursday!
Today we are joined by Miss Universe Australia, Priya Serrao, a woman who defies the mould of what constitutes a beauty queen. Priya is beautiful, yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s her brain that we find most impressive: she has interned for the United Nations in developing countries, has a law degree under her belt, is a vocal force for greater diversity and representation in the media, and works toward enacting change via her day job in public policy.</description>

Starting with Taylor Swift performing at the Melbourne Cup. Then, the Caroline Calloway saga that just won&amp;rsquo;t die (with a lil recap for those of you who have no idea what any of that means), and the think piece about performative friendships that had us squealing in delight.

When Jess was nine, her life was thrown into disarray by a cancer diagnosis. Within the year, she would lose all of her hair, and then, one of her legs. Now, Jess has turned her biggest hurdle into her biggest triumph - her career is built on the prosthetic limb she wears every day, helping her show her 180,000 Instagram followers that beauty comes in many different sizes and forms.</description>

Today we are joined by the delightful Leigh Campbell. If we are talking expert voices in the beauty and lifestyle space, Leigh’s the ultimate go-to. You probably grew up reading her columns and insights in Cosmopolitan magazine, or, later on, in the Huffington Post Australia. Or, perhaps, you found Leigh not through her work as a journalist and editor, but as a blogger; last year, she penned the wildly popular series Treading Water about her experience with infertility and miscarriage.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This week on the show, we are joined by the absolutely delightful Laura Byrne.
You might remember Laura from her time on The Bachelor, where she won Matty J’s heart and the affection of the country, too. Outside of reality television though, Laura runs Toni May, a jewellery company full of hand-crafted pieces that started selling at markets for a fun outside of her day job.
We meet a lot of people in this job, but we have to say, Laura is one of the kindest, warmest, most down to earth women we’ve had the pleasure of chatting to.</description>

Your eyebrows might be raised right now, and you might be wondering how a normal Sydney girl with a normal social media following could be so influential.

Rowi is an influencer, yes, but she’s not your average influencer. She might have more than a hundred thousand followers on Instagram, but she’s not about detox teas and teeth whitener. Instead, Rowi’s brand is her creativity.</description>

Plus, the messy, messy divorce between Brad and Angelina escalated this week as both leaked like crazy. Oh, and are anonymous gossip Instagram accounts good for the world or an exercise in bullying?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Steph Claire Smith is well-known for her presence on Instagram, but how has her approach to the platform changed as her following has boomed? We get her onto the show to ask her about the finite details of a social media presence that demands engagement of young girls. PLUS! Sylvia Jeffreys called out Woman&amp;rsquo;s Day this week for posting lies about her relationship, so how in the world do they get away with publishing utter lies?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hello listener friends! Coming up on today&amp;rsquo;s show: How did the media do in handling the tragic suicide of Kate Spade? The coverage was pretty deplorable if you ask us. Plus, does Miss America dumping the swimsuit section from their competitions mean pageants are feminist? AND we really need to deep dive into the strange underground world of female fitness influencers injecting themselves with steroids.

        <description>Podcast Description Don&amp;rsquo;t mess with celebrities and their clandestine sex lives; such was the message that come through this week, thanks to Love Island. Contestant Natasha not-so-subtly hinted to spending &amp;ldquo;two nights&amp;rdquo; with old mate Justin Bieber, but she&amp;rsquo;ll be damned if she tells us much more. So what&amp;rsquo;s the deal with water-tight NDAs around both sex and abuse? Plus, Hugh Grant was married this week in a spectacularly low-key affair, so is he officially Britain&amp;rsquo;s most reluctant celebrity?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s like Christmas, but better (!!!) with fashion and weddings and grandeur and tabloid drama. Yes, it’s royal wedding week and we’ll be damned if we aren’t spending (almost) the whole show on it. From the Great Markle Debacle to the dress of the century to the aisle walk that demanded more headlines than the wedding itself: We go deep and wide and, well, everywhere. Plus, Kim Kardashian’s sucky (ha) Instagram post that landed her in a boiling pot of hot water.</description>

Yeeeep, we’re interviewing former Bachelor star Jen Hawke - also known as Australia’s favourite reality TV villain - about the power of the producer.

        <description>Podcast Description Well, it’s been a big week in the world of celebrity divorce after Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced their “loving” split to the cries of love being dead. So why is it we feel so viscerally about break-ups like this? Is it because we feel we’ve being sold a lie about what a relationship and a break up looks like? Plus, a radio host’s orgasm story that was a little bit too much to stomach and the atrocity that is Meghan Markle daring to have a grey hair.</description>

Michelle thinks Davey and Flo will be the first to have sex, Zara thinks she&amp;rsquo;s wrong and mostly, we talk a whole lot of crap about a show that&amp;rsquo;s just a whole lot of crap. Loveable crap, that is. We also deep-dive the return of Britney Spears - considering she randomly re-surfaced in our news cycle TWICE this week - and discuss the media&amp;rsquo;s troubling response to a story about Robin Williams and his larrikin antics on the set of Mork &amp;amp; Mindy.</description>
