        <description>Podcast Description Rejection is redirection - everyone has dealt with rejection at a point. Sometimes the universe is here to just guide you into a much bigger and better situation that you could&#39;ve even imagined for yourself.
In this episode, I dive into a dating story time about a guy who got me hooked on him and then ghosted me - ultimately leaving me feeling rejected, hurt, and embarrassed. I also talk about how to know your value and how it was fairly easy for me to overcome this situation after time had passed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Self explanatory. If you see some major issues early on, my best advice is to get out while you still can. The red flags you see in the beginning are the reasons you&#39;ll most likely leave the relationship later - or they&#39;ll be the reason you&#39;re unhappy in a relationship. Yes, people can grow and change, however, I&#39;ve noticed that my gut was always telling me to run prior to diving deeper into a situation with someone.</description>

We get so caught up and easily fixated on a new relationship, or a partner that isn&#39;t giving us the love we deserve, and it becomes an ultimate form of distraction away from who we are, our goals, and what truly makes us happy. This episode is really just a reminder to work on yourself and your goals, and find the passion that drives you, instead of focusing on someone that isn&#39;t showing up for you.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get attached to someone we&amp;rsquo;ve just met&amp;hellip;because they&amp;rsquo;re nice.

        <description>Podcast Description I definitely have had my moments in relationships where I felt like I smothered my partner with desperate energy. I was needy and insecure because I didn&amp;rsquo;t love or value myself enough to know who I truly was. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know my worth, so I would project my insecurities often onto my boyfriends in hopes that would make them want to be with me more, but instead it often backfired and became messy.</description>
