I am really interested in hearing what you all have to say about this week's episode. The twins obviously shouldn’t have done that to their mom, but…it’s not like they were in the best situation. Is this really a crime of passion…or just teenage rebellion that went too far?

Hope your day is off to a good start. Today I wanted to talk about Armin Meiwes and what the hell was going on over there, I mean he was trying to cook sausage and eat it, I mean, yep he did that. Did he REALLY deserve the sentencing he got if someone WILLINGLY participated? Weird case right? Least he’s vegan now, that’s good. Hope you have a wonderful day today, make good choices and let me know who you want me to talk about next week!</description></item><item><title>Murder, Mystery &amp; Makeup Podcast Trailer | Murder, Mystery &amp; Makeup</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1125850110/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1125850110/</guid><description>Podcast Description Transcript</description></item></channel></rss>
