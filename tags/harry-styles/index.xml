        <description>Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don′t know what&amp;rsquo;s lost ′til you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin&amp;rsquo; for us to do
We don&amp;rsquo;t really like what′s on the news, but it′s on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin&amp;rsquo; someone else′s name
I remember back at Jonny&amp;rsquo;s place, it′s not the same anymore</description>

        <description>Boyfriends
They think you′re so easy
They take you for granted
They don&amp;rsquo;t know they′re just misunderstanding
You
You, you&amp;rsquo;re back at it again
Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he&amp;rsquo;s thinking
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
You′re no closer to him
Now you′re halfway home</description>

        <description>You got a new life
Am I bothering you?
Do you wanna talk?
We share the last line
Then we drink the wall
′Til we wanna talk
I go &amp;lsquo;round and ′round
Satellite
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you&amp;rsquo;re lonely down there
Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that I am right here?
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you′re lonely down there</description>

        <description>Black and white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ashtray, swimming pool
Hot wax, jump off the roof
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Should we just keep driving?&amp;rdquo;
Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Should we just keep driving?</description>

        <description>Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Living in a daydream
She said, &amp;ldquo;Love me like you paid me&amp;rdquo;
You know, I′ll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Ooh-ooh
Stay until the morning
&amp;lsquo;Cause, baby, loving you′s the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)</description>

        <description>You got, you got the cinema
It′s you
And I&amp;rsquo;m not gettin′ over it
Darlin&amp;rsquo;, is it cool
If I&amp;rsquo;m stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we′re in time
If you′re getting yourself wet for me
I guess you&amp;rsquo;re all mine
You′re sleeping in this bed with me
I just think you&amp;rsquo;re cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I′m cool too?
Or am I too into you?</description>

        <description>You were riding your bike to the sound of &amp;ldquo;It′s No Big Deal&amp;rdquo;
And you&amp;rsquo;re trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing about the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming ′til now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family, &amp;lsquo;cause they never showed you love</description>

        <description>Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you′ve become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin&amp;rsquo; about who you are
Your delicate point of view, I
Was thinkin′ about you
I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to, I&amp;rsquo;m</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4000300005/</guid>
        <description>I′m on the roof, you&amp;rsquo;re in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you′re missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You&amp;rsquo;d be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)</description>

        <description>Come on, Harry, we wanna say &amp;ldquo;good night&amp;rdquo; to you!
Holding me back
Gravity′s holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don&amp;rsquo;t we leave it at that?
Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I′m the one who will stay
Oh-oh-oh
In this world
It&amp;rsquo;s just us
You know it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as it was</description>

        <description>One, two, three
One, two
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There′s never been someone who&amp;rsquo;s so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
&amp;ldquo;Give me something old and red&amp;rdquo;
I pay for it more than I did back then
There′s just no getting through</description>

        <description>Things haven′t been quite the same
There&amp;rsquo;s a haze on the horizon, baby
It′s only been a couple of days and I miss you
Yeah
When nothin&amp;rsquo; really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I&amp;rsquo;ll do everythin′ I can to help you through
If you′re feelin&amp;rsquo; down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby</description>

        <description>Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah (oh)
You′re sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted &amp;lsquo;round your tongue
I don′t want you to get lost
I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to go broke
I want you
It&amp;rsquo;s ′cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way</description>
