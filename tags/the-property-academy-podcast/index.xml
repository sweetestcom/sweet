While seemingly clear cut – sell a property (other than your own home) within 5 years and you'll be taxed – there are many fishhooks.&amp;nbsp;
For instance, if you show a pattern of buying and flipping your own home then you will be taxed on those transactions. If you inherit a property with a sibling but purchase your siblings half, then any gains on the extra 50% of the property are taxable if you sell within 5 years .</description></item><item><title>How Does The # of Bedrooms A Property Has Impact Its Capital Growth?

inflation – buy up big early in the game because you know the value of properties will go up over time as they become more valuable
managing cash – not developing your properties too much too soon, in case you can't meet an unexpected expense, and
negotiation – people are much more willing to negotiate when they are in straightened circumstances.</description></item><item><title>What Andrew Is Buying Right Now ... 3 Real Properties Andrew Is Investing In ...

An example of this is where a vendor would appear to sell a property at a high price, but would actually sell it to the purchaser for a much lower price. If the bank lends to the purchaser based on the higher price then it is possible for someone to purchase a property with no deposit at all.</description></item><item><title>What's the Difference Between a Mortgage Deposit and a Vendor Deposit?

Air NZ's cancellation of overseas travel has given many New Zealanders flight credits which need to be used within two years.

The primary difference is that commercial property is primarily driven by yield and an assessment about the quality of the tenant as opposed to the quality of the property. This distinction is primarily caused by the fact that while the residential market is primarily made up of owner-occupiers (about 76% – only 24% are investors) the entire commercial market is made up of investors .</description></item><item><title>The Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy – What Investors Need to Know | Ep. 295 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041299/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041299/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy, which is a risk mitigation tactic. It involves slowly purchasing assets over time and consistently investing in the market in increments - since no one really knows when the market may take a sudden hit.&amp;nbsp;
Throughout the episode, we discuss the benefits (market timing) and drawbacks of this strategy. &amp;nbsp;Those drawbacks are primarily that following this strategy can mean less time in the market, which can be damaging for investors with relatively short investment time horizons.</description></item><item><title>Here's What Real Estate Agents Are Seeing In the Market.

If you have lending for 5 or more properties with one bank – or total investment loans of more than $3 million, then the bank may transfer you so that your lending is held with the commercial division of the bank.

This is based on the argument that house price inflation over the last 60 years in New Zealand has primarily been driven by one-off factors, that have cumulated to keep house prices rising.&amp;nbsp;
Here, we debate whether this will continue into the future and what one-off factors could happen in the future to spark further house price inflation.</description></item><item><title>Should I Buy My First Home or First Investment Property? 5 Scenarios For How to Get Both More Quickly | Ep. 291 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041303/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041303/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should buy your first home or first investment first, with a real worked case study from a fellow listener.&amp;nbsp;

In this announcement, the government will give up to $4,000 to tenants who are in rent arrears, who can't pay their rent and who are at risk of being evicted.&amp;nbsp;
This money needs to be paid back by the tenant, which has the effect of transferring the liability from the landlord to the government.

This is a question Serena, a fellow listener of the podcast has asked.&amp;nbsp;
We've probably shied away from talking too much about the alternatives to renovation for fear of being too self-promotional on the podcast.

Our conclusion is that the Christchurch and Wellington apartment markets are more likely to hold value compared to the Auckland apartment market. This is because apartments in these cities are more likely to be owner by owner-occupiers, have less reliance on international tourism and the international student market, and because of (in Wellington's case) a reliance on government employers, which are less likely to call for redundancies.</description></item><item><title>Case Study: Real Investor Buys 5 Properties In 18 Months Starting With $30k Deposit ...

We discuss that you either need to: 1) get a discount from the developer by buying a property through a bulk buying scheme, or 2) buy the property below its registered valuation, or 3) Purchase a property off the plans so that some capital growth will have occurred in the market before you settle the property.</description></item><item><title>Listener Question: The Pros and Cons of Student Rentals in Property Investment | Ep. 263 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041331/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041331/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the pros and cons of owning student rentals. This is a question that's come in from a fellow listener of the podcast.
Throughout the show we share the three different types of student rentals:
Standard student flats, which tend to be higher-yielding, but much higher maintenance
Purpose-built room by room rentals, which are higher-yielding, but get lower capital growth since they are an investor specific product
Student apartments (standard apartments) which tend to be between the two of them

This episode is based off a question one of our property partners received from a Kiwi property investor based in France.&amp;nbsp;
The key takeaway is that you need to know the difference between a suburb's median sale price and the median house value.

Generally, the toughest issue is to get lending from banks in order to purchase property. Overseas investors are typically restricted to 65-70% of lending on properties, and their income is scaled back under the tests to 60-90% of usual income. That range is based on which country the borrower is located in and the risk of currency fluctuation.</description></item><item><title>Interest rates Tumble to 2.65% ...

This seeming anomaly is based on how the median house price is calculated. This measure of average does not track differences in the distribution of houses sold across the country.&amp;nbsp;
If a higher proportion of Auckland houses are sold within a given month the median house price will increase, even if fundamental house prices do not increase over the same period.</description></item><item><title>When You Can Sell 1 Property to Buy 2 Properties | Ep. 256 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041338/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041338/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss when you can sell 1 property to buy 2 properties. Banks have internal LVRs that restrict how much they are willing to lend against certain types of properties.&amp;nbsp;
Holding these asset types takes up a lot of equity in an investors portfolio, which means that in some cases an investor can sell one property in order to buy two more. These are often niche investments, such as bare land, hotel units and small apartments.</description></item><item><title>Update: Have AirBnbs Flooded the Market?

In a Rent to Buy property-purchasing structure, a vendor will agree to sell a purchaser a property for today's price, but the purchaser does not have to pay for the property for a number of years (e.g. 5 years). Over that time, the purchaser will pay market rent to the vendor, plus an additional amount, which counts as part of the deposit.</description></item><item><title>How to Find The Most Profitable Areas to Invest In: A Webinar Recap | Ep. 252 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041342/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041342/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss and recap our recent webinar: How to Find the Most Profitable Areas to Invest in.

In simple terms, overcapitalisation is where you spend more money to renovate a property, but you get less out of the property than what you've spent.
This applies to any dollar that you've spent on a property and not seen a return on that dollar (that is anywhere, where you have spent a dollar and not seen your property increase in value by a dollar).</description></item><item><title>Real Data: Real Numbers About How Kiwis Are Planning For Retirement | Ep. 250 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041344/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041344/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we reveal real aggregated data from the retirement plans of Opes Partners clients.

These policies govern how much the retail bank is willing to lend on different property types.&amp;nbsp;
Most interesting for property investors, the bank will only lend a maximum of 70% of a property's value for any investment property. This includes any properties that would have been exempt under the previous LVR rules, like new builds and the dollar for dollar exemption.</description></item><item><title>Real Insight: Here's How the Market Is Operating In the First Days of Level 2 | Ep. 248 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041346/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041346/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the property market is operating now that the country has come out of lockdown. This stems from a recent article Andrew provided comment for in The Press and for Stuff.co.nz (read the article here).
We are seeing pent up demand coming onto the market, which likely stems from: a) the property market not being able to function during lockdown. 8 weeks worth of demand is now hitting the market in one week.</description></item><item><title>New Data Released: How The Property Market Performed During the Lockdown | Ep. 247 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041347/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041347/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the property market performed during the Coronavirus-induced lockdown. This is based on data recently released by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
As predicted, volumes massively dropped during April 2020, down just under 79% year on year. However that decrease is not spread evenly, Auckland's volumes, decreased just under 69% year on year. That is in part the reason why the median house price continued to rise to a record price of $680,000.</description></item><item><title>Inequality: A Tale of 2 Suburbs | Ep. 246 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041348/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041348/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss inequality and the difference between how different suburbs appreciate in value. Even if different suburbs appreciate at the same rate, if there were small differences in their initial starting values, one suburb can become more expensive than others within the same city.&amp;nbsp;
This means that homeowners in one suburb can see their wealth increase at a much faster rate than homeowners in a neighbouring (slower growth) suburb.</description></item><item><title>How to Create a Self-Funding Property Portfolio | Ep. 245 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041349/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041349/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how you can create a self-funding property portfolio. Generally, in property investment, there are two types of properties that you want to buy –&amp;nbsp;capital growth properties that tend to grow in value quickly and yield properties that produce more cashflow.&amp;nbsp;
The trouble for most New Zealanders is that to invest in property they need to borrow the entire purchase price of a property. This typically means that capital growth properties will be cashflow negative.</description></item><item><title>3 Things You Can Do To Prepare For Hard Financial Times | Ep. 244 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041350/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041350/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 3 things you can do to prepare in case times get tough financially:
Build up a 'mojo' or emergency savings accounts. Initially set this up with $2,000. Then, when you can, build it up to 3 months worth of expenses. This will give you added confidence that you can weather financial storms, and allows you to take more risk
Get revolving credit accounts in place.</description></item><item><title>What Are 'Good Fundamentals' Anyway? | Ep. 243 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041351/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041351/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what "Good Fundamentals" actually means. It's common to hear that you should buy properties in areas with 'good fundamentals', but often it's not defined what that actually means.&amp;nbsp;
For us it means:
high population growth
tight supply
high demand
high average incomes
low unemployment and a diversified economy
We also walk through the data showing which of New Zealand's regions tend to have these good fundamentals.</description></item><item><title>Tradeoffs Between Capital Growth and Yield in Property Investment | Ep. 242 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041352/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041352/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the tradeoff that is typically made between capital growth and cashflow (also known as yield) in property investment.&amp;nbsp;

Here, we discuss how investor behaviour is changing. Falling interest rates are causing investors to look at higher risk assets in order to get a return on their investment. This decreases yields in general and forces all investors to move towards slightly riskier assets than they were previously investing in.</description></item><item><title>Special Guest: Mortgage Broking Trends &amp; How to Find a Good Mortgage Adviser | Ep. 240 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041354/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041354/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Darcy Ungaro from the NZ Everyday Investor Podcast.

These reasons are:
The drop in interest rates make it cheaper for homebuyers and investors to purchase property. Lower interest rates also decrease the return from term deposit, which encourage investors to seek yield in the property market
First home buyers are able to save money throughout the lockdown and are likely to form new savings habits
Investors are likely to move their focus from New Zealand's regions and instead pull back to the major cities, which have more diversified economies and have greater prospects for employment
Similarly, investors are likely to move their focus from commercial property to residential property
The Reserve Bank's increase in the money supply through the Large Scale Asset Purchasing Programme is likely to create a Cantillon effect, where investors seek higher yielding assets, which will likely push up the price of shares and property
Bonus: the loan to value ratio restriction are being removed, which allow investors to invest with more freedom.</description></item><item><title>Cheat on the Bank ...

This is because when you have all your lending with one bank, they cross secure the assets and you can only borrow a maximum of 70% against the value of your investment properties. But, if you move that lending across to another bank, you're able to borrow up to 80% of the value.</description></item><item><title>5 Strategies to Get More Money From the Bank and Pass the Income Stress Tests | Ep. 232 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041362/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041362/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 5 different strategies that you can use to pass the bank's servicing stress test.

The model includes purchasing a residential property outright, without any debt –&amp;nbsp;the investment divided into 12 equal shares and offered to investors. The benefit of this model is that an investor can get exposure to the property market for a lower entry price. The cons are that when a property is purchased without debt, there is no opportunity for leverage .</description></item><item><title>Major Update: LVR Restrictions to be Eased ...

A common misconception is that when first home buyers purchase a do-up that they can borrow the renovation costs as well ... because the property will soon be worth more. That's not the case, you cannot borrow renovation costs, unless you already have more than a 20% deposit.</description></item><item><title>Why Property's Get More Profitable Over Time &amp; the 8th Wonder of the World | Ep. 224 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041370/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041370/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss compounding growth and why small differences in capital growth rates quickly add due to the compounding nature of property price growth.&amp;nbsp;

There are four ways we discuss, each with their pros and cons:
Using a reverse mortgage to live off the equity within your properties
Using a principal and interest mortgage to pay down debt to create a decent rental yield you can live off
Buying multiple properties, selling half and paying off the mortgage on the rest to create a rental yield
Restructuring your portfolio when you need the cash from one geared towards capital growth to one geared towards yield
Our conclusion and preferred option is that the last option best suits most Kiwi buy and hold investors.</description></item><item><title>Strategies To Supercharge Your Property Portfolio | Ep. 221 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041373/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041373/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how you can go from 2 properties to 5 properties and beyond. At some point, many investors hit a wall and the bank stops lending to them. No lending = no new investment properties.&amp;nbsp;
But, unless you understand why the bank isn't lending you more money, it's very hard to fix it. Worst of all if you keep applying for lending and get denied your credit record will continue to disintegrate – making it harder for you to get lending in the future.</description></item><item><title>How To Pay Your Mortgage Off Faster – What Homeowners Need to Know | Ep. 220 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041374/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 21:16:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041374/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to pay your mortgage off faster so that you can get in the position to invest in property.
During the show we give the example of a first home buyer who has purchased a $500,000 property with a 20% deposit, we then show how they can reduce the time it would take to be able to buy a second investment property from 4 years, to 3 years and then down to 2 years.</description></item><item><title>Review: Golden Homes – Should You Buy an Investment Property From Golden Homes | Ep. 219 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041375/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041375/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should buy an investment property from Golden Homes.&amp;nbsp;
Golden homes sits at the slightly premium end of the market relative to other competitors such as GJ Gardiner, Mike Greer and Stonewood Homes, which the price reflects.

This was the most popular question in our recent webinar that considered all of New Zealand's regions, considering which would be the most resilient property markets.&amp;nbsp;
Our view is that Auckland, as the centre of the most jobs and economic activity, will always handle any economic downturn better than other regions in NZ.</description></item><item><title>Degentrification – Should You Invest in New Brighton, Christchurch? | Ep. 213 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041381/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041381/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the concept of de-gentrification, where an area with significant economic activity begins to lose it.
We apply this concept to New Brighton and discuss what investors could look for within suburbs and areas to invest.

In that episode (#208) we discussed three speculative scenarios, where increases to debt availability would lead to higher house prices.&amp;nbsp;
Paul (the listener) asked why increased availability of debt would lead to higher house prices as it wouldn't change the fundamental value of the property.&amp;nbsp;
During the show, we discuss that there isn't really a fundamental value of property, given that home-buying decisions are primarily driven by emotion, rather than rational thought.</description></item><item><title>Survey Responses: How Is The Property Market Operating Under Lock Down? | Ep. 210 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041384/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041384/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the property market is operating under the Covid-19 induced shutdown.

We start off by recommending QV, a New Zealand based property website that allows you to check data about any suburb in New Zealand, including seeing what properties have sold in a suburb and for how much.

These are:
The maximum mortgage term lengthening from 30 to 35 or 40 years
The bank's test interest rate falling from 7% to 5%, and
The LVR restriction for investors of existing properties relaxing to 75%

paying your deposit into a solicitor's trust account. You solicitor will collect the funds to execute the transaction&amp;nbsp;
make additional payments to your developer if you are using a progressive payments model. You don't need to do this if you are using a turn key model&amp;nbsp;
conduct a pre-settlement inspection to make sure the property is presented as per the contract with all agreed chattels&amp;nbsp;
get a loan approved through your bank if your previous preapproval has lapsed
Receive a valuation or a certificate of completion
receiving a chattel valuation to maximise the depreciation you can claim from the IRD (to decrease your tax).</description></item><item><title>What Happens If I Buy a Property For More than It's Worth? | Ep. 205 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041389/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041389/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what happens if you come to settle a property, and it is worth less than the purchase price?
This is most important for investors who have signed an unconditional contract to purchase a brand new property that is currently under construction.
If we do go through a period of economic downturn due to the Coronavirus, then there may be a situation where some investors come to settle a property (12 months after going unconditional), and the property is now worth less than the purchase price.</description></item><item><title>Coronavirus: Mortgage Holiday Scheme – What Property Owners Need to Know | Ep. 204 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041390/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041390/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Peter Norris from Lateral Partners to discuss the Mortgage Holiday Scheme that is currently available as part of the economic response to the Coronavirus.&amp;nbsp;

In that month the median rent hit $520 per week, up from $495 the year before.&amp;nbsp;
That equates to a 5.1% increase over 12 months, compared to general inflation of 1.6%. That means that rents are increasing at a faster rate than all other goods. That's bad news for tenants as more of their income will then be going towards rent.</description></item><item><title>How Coronavirus Might Change Your Investment Strategy | Ep. 202 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041392/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041392/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the Coronavirus might change your investment strategy. The decrease in interest rates have two effects:
They decrease the return savers get through term deposits
They increase the return property investors get through lower borrowing costs
It is not likely that property investors can get a higher cash return from their deposit as opposed to keeping their money in the bank. These small changes in interest rates can have a big impact to the bottom line.</description></item><item><title>Interest Rates Set to Fall Further – Details of the RBNZ's LSAP | Ep. 201 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041393/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041393/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Reserve Bank's announcement that it will use unconventional monetary policy to decrease interest rates further.
The Reserve Bank has announced a $30 billion programme to purchase government bonds on the secondary market. This programme will operate over 12 months to decrease long term interest rates.
That will likely have three effects:
Lower long term interest rates will decrease the government's borrowing costs, making it cheaper to borrow and conduct expansionary fiscal policy</description></item><item><title>On the Ground in the Christchurch Property Market | Ep. 200 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041394/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041394/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Micky Limmer from Bayleys Canterbury joins the show to talk about the current dynamics of the Christchurch property market.&amp;nbsp;

Some New Zealanders are doing it tough at the moment, struggling to get by. As landlords, that may include some of our tenants. That means that there is more risk that our tenants won't make their rental payments.&amp;nbsp;

The first is that it is best not to sign a contract to purchase property throughout this isolation period.

You can't conduct a valuation, or do a site visit, lawyers will likely be slow and banks inundated with other requests.</description></item><item><title>Questions to Ask a Real Estate Agent Before You List | Ep. 196 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041398/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041398/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Micky Limmer from Bayleys Canterbury joins the show to talk about the questions you should ask real estate agents when you are planning to sell your property.&amp;nbsp;
Micky mentions that we should make sure that we respond well to the agent, since we'll be working with them for a few months.

Gentrification occurs when a suburb or town begins to become more trendy and upmarket because the type of people who live in that area changes.&amp;nbsp;
This is often the cause of long term social change, but also because of the fundamentals of the suburb or area.&amp;nbsp;
Take Auckland's Ponsonby. Decades ago the suburb was considered a place for blue-collar workers to live.</description></item><item><title>How to Set Buying Rules For Yourself | Ep. 192 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041402/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041402/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to set buying rules for yourself.
Buying rules are a concept in property investment where you set some restrictions about the sort of properties that you will and won't buy.
Because property investment can become emotional, some investors will think 'but, I really like this house' and buy it anyway ... even if the purchase doesn't stack up from a numbers perspective.</description></item><item><title>Will My Mortgage Repayments Go Up If I Use Equity in My Home? | Ep. 191 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041403/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 21:14:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041403/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether using equity in your home to purchase an investment property will increase your mortgage repayments.&amp;nbsp;
When you use equity frim within your home to purchase an investment property, you typically take out a separate loan against your property, which is sometimes in the structure of a mortgage top-up.&amp;nbsp;
You then use this loan as the deposit for your new investment property.&amp;nbsp;
Because you have taken out additional lending, there will be additional repayments against that mortgage.</description></item><item><title>Why the Government and the RNZ Want Your House Price to Go Up | Ep. 190 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041404/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041404/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, independent economist, Tony Alexander joins the show.&amp;nbsp;

Many listeners will think back to the 80's and remember how high interest rates were at the time. Some even treat it like a competition.&amp;nbsp;
It was not uncommon at the time to see interest rates of 18-26%.
Naturally, anyone who ever paid interest at that level is likely wondering 'how low can interest rates stay low?</description></item><item><title>Tony Alexander Answers: Is there a housing shortage in NZ? | Ep. 188 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041406/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041406/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Tony Alexander, an independent economist, joins the show to answer: do we have a housing shortage in New Zealand?
Being the good economist he is, Tony identifies that, as long as there isn't government interference in a market in the form of price controls, a free market can never have a technical shortage.
Why?
Because the market price will adjust to balance supply and demand.&amp;nbsp;</description></item><item><title>Tony Alexander Reveals What Makes House Prices Go Up | Ep. 187 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041407/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041407/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, independent economist, Tony Alexander joins the podcast. Tony was the Chief Economist at BNZ for almost 25 years before striking out on his own.
Here, Tony looks at the primary factors that lead to increases in house prices. The primary factors include:
decreases in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, taking on more bank lending becomes cheaper and more affordable. That decrease encourages more prospective home buyers to take on more debt and bid up house prices.</description></item><item><title>Tony Alexander Compares Christchurch With the Rest of the Country | Ep. 186 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041408/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041408/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Tony Alexander joins Ed and Andrew on the podcast.&amp;nbsp;

This is a topic Andrew recently covered on a webinar with the Auckland Property Investors Association.&amp;nbsp;
An investor would typically start to transition their portfolio as they near retirement, and in the episode, Andrew suggests that you should allow about 5 years for the transition.&amp;nbsp;
Allowing several years allows you the ability to sell at the most convenient time in the market.</description></item><item><title>How Long It Takes For a Mortgage to Get Approved? | Ep. 184 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041410/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041410/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the turnaround time it takes to get a mortgage approved in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
Right now the banks can take up to 7 business days to open your email to and start to process your mortgage. They are incredibly short-staffed, but demand is also increasing.&amp;nbsp;
Typically due diligence on a brand-new off-the-plan property will last 10 days. That means that there are only three days left for the bank to approve your mortgage for an investment property.</description></item><item><title>Revealed: How Property Coaches Get Paid? | Ep. 183 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041411/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041411/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we reveal exactly how property coaches get paid and a few common misconceptions about property coaches.&amp;nbsp;
There are different types of property coaches. Some like us source properties on your behalf and therefore will earn a commission when you choose to invest in a property. Others will charge you a fee to teach you how to do that sourcing and any renovations yourself.&amp;nbsp;
While we at Opes Partners do not charge a fee for our service, some in our industry do charge you a fee to put together your strategy.</description></item><item><title>Fears That Stop People Investing – The Unknown | Ep. 182 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041412/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041412/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss another fear that holds people back from getting start as investors – fear of the unknown.
Perhaps there's something in the back of your mind holding you back from investing.

Every investor accepts (and hopefully budgets for) the fact that their properties will require maintenance throughout the year. However, we also know that from time to time investment properties will require capital maintenance, especially if the property is older.&amp;nbsp;
This could be the replacement of a roof, painting the outside of the property, rewiring the house, or some other major works.</description></item><item><title>How to Not Get Screwed By a Developer | Ep. 176 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041418/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041418/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a couple of recent stories that have developed in the media where young first home buyers were on the wrong end of a sunset clause.&amp;nbsp;
A sunset clause is typically used in a sale and purchase agreement to protect the buyer of a property that has not been built yet. Using this clause, if a developer has not completed the build by a certain date, then the purchaser has the right to cancel the contract.</description></item><item><title>Is the Government Attacking Landlords?

The proposed changes include:
Revoking the ability for landlords to request a tenant to vacate with no cause (currently 90 days)
Limiting rent increases to once every 12 months, rather than once every 6 months
Taking away the ability for landlords to solicit bids for rents.

1. Overpaying for a property – solve it by getting a valuation before going unconditional
2. Not being able to secure a tenant because of too may properties coming on market at the same time&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;solve it by investing in a staged development

The West Coast region, for instance, has a total of almost 4 years worth of properties already on the market. No additional West Coast properties could come on the market, and there would still be properties available for buyers for another 4 years, given today's sales volumes.</description></item><item><title>Coronavirus – Should You Not Buy Property Because of It? | Ep. 172 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041422/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 03:44:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041422/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should not buy property, or put off that decision because of Coronavirus. In general, the answer is no. While the media has made a big deal of the potential impacts the likelihood of a widespread outbreak is still low-to-medium in New Zealand.
On top of that, we expect a decrease in the OCR, which should stimulate spending and help property buyers and homeowners.</description></item><item><title>Why You Want Your Development to Have a Mix of Investors and Owner Occupiers | Ep. 171 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041423/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041423/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why it is preferred to have a mix of owner-occupier and investors within your development.&amp;nbsp;
This is generally for three reasons:
You want to sell your property to an owner-occupier in the future, who is likely to be more emotionally invested than an investor, so you want a property that is going to appeal to an owner-occupier
When the properties are finished, you don't want your properties to be untenanted because all the properties come on to the rental market at the same time
owner-occupiers are more likely to look after the neighbourhood than tenants
However, we also discuss how this will change based on the type of property.</description></item><item><title>The 4 Core Title-types in the NZ Property Market | Ep. 170 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041424/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041424/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the four different titles that are used in the New Zealand property market. These are:
Freehold, also known as fee-simple. This is the most common type of ownership in New Zealand where you own the land and you are generally free to do what you like with it, subject to any caveats, covenants, or local bylaws
Leasehold –&amp;nbsp;this is where you own the building on the land, but you rent the land from another party.</description></item><item><title>Can small towns really deliver yields x2 as high as bigger cities? | Ep. 169 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041425/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041425/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that it is often thought that smaller towns will deliver yields that are x2 as high as bigger cities. While that might be true for gross yields, this is generally not true of net yields.&amp;nbsp;
That is because smaller town properties often have higher costs as a proportion of the rent. For instance, if you were to buy two properties that are exactly the same, one in a small town and another in a big city, you would likely spend the exact same amount on maintenance.</description></item><item><title>The 3 Types of Trading Properties You Can Use | Ep. 168 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041426/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041426/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the 3 different types of property trading strategies you can use.&amp;nbsp;
Previous listeners have asked whether renovation is the same thing as trading. The truth is that renovation is a type of trading, but there are other types of trading also used by property investors. These are:
Renovating existing properties and selling them back on to the market
Buying a property and selling it to another investor at a profit
Buying a property and selling it straight back on to the market
There are different circumstances that would lead to each of these strategies being used, which we discuss on the show, as well as what you would need to have to execute these three different strategies.</description></item><item><title>What Sort of Retirement Lifestyle Do Most Kiwis Want? | Ep. 167 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041427/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041427/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a report released a few years back by the Financial Markets Authority, with research conducted by Colmar Brunton.&amp;nbsp;

40 metres squared – KiwiBank and ASB
45 metres squared –&amp;nbsp;ANZ
50 metres squared – BNZ
60 metres squared –&amp;nbsp;TSB

We discuss the trends in house price growth, specifically identifying that suburbs in the inner-city tend to grow the slowest on average because they are full of apartments, which don't grow as quickly.

Capital gains – changing market conditions increase the value of your property. This happens slowly but it is consistent. That is why capital gains will often give you the greatest gains, even though you don't have control over it.&amp;nbsp;

interest costs
property management

If they are in a secure financial position so they don't fall over throughout the project
What their quality of finish of their previous builds are like, and if they are consistent with the plans
Whether they are good to deal with and are likely to come to the party if a disagreement occurs
Whether their building design is diverse.</description></item><item><title>Why You Need to Make More Money | Ep. 157 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041437/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041437/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why you need to make more money ... and why building your wealth is not a bad thing.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;This is a rule of thumb, which says that once you decide the level of retirement income you want, multiply it by 20 and that is the number of freehold assets you need to produce the income you want.&amp;nbsp;
That means if you want to live on $100,000 a year, you'll need roughly $2,000,000 worth of assets to produce that level of income every year in perpetuity.</description></item><item><title>Valuations – What They Are and How They Differ | Ep. 153 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041441/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041441/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss all the different types of valuations.

This has some far-reaching implications for property investors and mortgage brokers.&amp;nbsp;
It likely means that investors and homebuyers will find the property they want first and sign it conditional to finance before taking the property to the bank. This means that the bank will prioritise the deal.&amp;nbsp;
It is also an indication of strength in the banking and property sector .</description></item><item><title>Why Are The Properties Property Coaches Show Me More Expensive Than Developers? | Ep. 150 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041444/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041444/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why properties are sometimes more expensive when you buy a property through a property coach than if you look on a developer's website.&amp;nbsp;
The reason this is sometimes the case is that developers will exclude some parts of the property from that price. For instance, you might see a property for $499K, but it might exclude the driveway, landscaping or the letterbox. If you wanted it all included, it might cost $525K.</description></item><item><title>Your Property Investment Strategy – The First Crucial Steps | Ep. 149 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041445/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041445/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to figure out what you want in a property investment strategy.

We discuss potential solutions and risk mitigation for each of the following:
Issues with lending, broken down into – Interest rates rising increasing your expenses, not being able to get borrowing from the bank, and not being able to have interest-only loans renewed
Vacancy and tenancy problems – what if your rental property is turned into a P-lab or attracts unsavoury tenants?</description></item><item><title>Ringfencing – What Investors Need to Know | Ep. 147 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041447/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041447/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss ringfencing, what it is and how property investors can combat these recent tax changes.&amp;nbsp;
From April 2019 property investors haven't been able to claim rental property losses against their income. Previously investors were able to claim a tax refund on any losses made by their rental property. That meant that if the property was negatively geared the tax could make it cheaper to own a rental property.</description></item><item><title>Depreciation – Everything Investors Need to Know | Ep. 146 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041448/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041448/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss depreciation. Depreciation is when the value of the things inside your home gradually decrease in value. It's a cost to you as an investor, but you don't actually pay for it in cash. This means that you can use depreciation to decrease the amount of tax you pay to the IRD each year.&amp;nbsp;
Since the 2011-2012 financial year investors have no longer been able to claim depreciation on the value of their building (if it has a useful life of 50 years or less).</description></item><item><title>Overseas Investors Getting Into the Property Market | Ep. 145 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041449/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041449/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the restrictions put in place on foreign residential property buyers from the Overseas Investment Act.

Many investors today question whether they can still get an interest-only mortgage in today's market. The answer is yes. But, the interest-only mortgages of today are different from those of the past.&amp;nbsp;
Previously, it was possible to secure a 30-year interest-only mortgage.

This comes off the back of a recent client story, where our property coaching client received poor accounting and portfolio structuring advice from their brother. Although a capable small business accountant –&amp;nbsp;the brother in question was not a tax or property specialist, which was causing our client's property portfolio to be costing more than it should have.</description></item><item><title>How to Choose a Property Coach | Ep. 142 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041452/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 09:44:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041452/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to choose a property coaching company. Every property coaching company is likely to recommend and promote a specific strategy for their clients. Some will promote buy and hold strategies, others focus on renovation and others, still, on development.&amp;nbsp;
We suggest that first-time property investors looking for a property coach should look at other clients who are using the property coaches and look at the strategies those clients are implementing.</description></item><item><title>How Many Properties Do You Need? | Ep. 141 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041453/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041453/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that contrary to popular belief you don't need to buy as many houses as you can.

Our key takeaway is that although we can all identify what a slump looks like in the text books, a real property slump (especially in the main centres) looks less like a downturn and more like a prolonged stagnation / flattening of property prices.&amp;nbsp;
We present a new model for looking at and considering slumps, which comes from Tony Alenders's economic reports.</description></item><item><title>Is There An Over-supply of Properties in Christchurch | Ep. 139 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041455/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041455/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there is an oversupply of property in Christchurch –&amp;nbsp;with specific reference as to whether Christchurch might turn into a 'donut-city', where the centre of the city lacks development.&amp;nbsp;
We make specific reference to the Canterbury earthquakes. These are the primary cause for higher development in the suburbs and satellite towns than in Christchurch central up until recently.&amp;nbsp;

Addington has had the 3rd fastest house price growth of any Christchurch suburbs since the turn of the century. The only two suburbs that grew at a faster rate were the wealthier suburbs of Strowan and Fendalton. These suburbs wouldn't be appropriate for investors to necessarily park their money in.</description></item><item><title>Should I Sell My Small Town Investment and Buy In the Main Centre? | Ep. 137 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041457/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041457/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a question sent in my another listener, which says: "I already have an investment property in Whangarei, should I buy another one there, or sell my existing investment property and buy in the main centre?"
Often the main centres aren't as expensive as one might think. Median sale prices can be misleading as your investment property doesn't have to be the median property. Similarly, small towns like Whangarei are actually more expensive than properties in cities like Christchurch at the moment.</description></item><item><title>You Can Only Pick 2 Out of 3 of These Three Things | Ep. 136 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041458/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:12:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041458/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there is such a thing as cashflow positive or negative properties. This question came in from a listener of the show. We agree that there is no such thing as a cashflow positive or negative property ... sure there are high yielding properties, but whether a property produces cash or not is based on how you have structured your investment. If you borrow with 100% lending and your property is geared for capital growth it will usually provide a cash loss.</description></item><item><title>Fears that Stop People Investing – The Market | Ep. 135 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041459/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 20:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041459/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one of the key fears that stops people from investing in property –&amp;nbsp;the market. Or, rather, fear that the market is going to crash and that property prices will drop suddenly and significantly.
We compare economist predictions from January 2009 with real data about how the property market performed and show that generally the hysteria often seen in newspapers rarely plays out in practice.</description></item><item><title>Two-timing the Banks – What investors need to know | Ep. 134 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041460/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041460/</guid><description>Podcast Description This is the final episode where are joined by Eugene Bartsaikin from Twine Financial Advisers –&amp;nbsp;and we discuss split banking. This is where you use multiple banks as part of the structuring of your lending strategy.&amp;nbsp;
The key benefit of using multiple banks is that, if used correctly, you:
&amp;nbsp;may be able to borrow more
will have more control over your assets
will have more freedom in terms of how you manage your money
and your assets will be more secure.</description></item><item><title>Case Study: Building a Lending Strategy | Ep. 133 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041461/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041461/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Eugene Bartsaikin from Twine Financial Advisers. Together, we discuss two case studies of Eugene's clients who have had lending strategies created for them.&amp;nbsp;
The first is a Christian couple who were regularly giving to the church. Eugene identified that their long term ambition was to be more generous and give more to their community. Eugene encourages them to put more away towards their mortgage today (by tithing less) so that they can build their wealth and give more over their lifetime.</description></item><item><title>What it Means to "Structure Your Mortgage" – What Investors Need to Know | Ep. 132 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041462/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041462/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what mortgage brokers mean when they talk about structuring your mortgage. Structuring your mrotgage encapsulates everything about your mortgage and how it is set up. This includes:
Whether your loan is on Principal and Interest or Interest Only
The repayments you make to the bank
Your interest rate and whether you are 'rate splitting'
which bank you are with
The term of the mortgage
Additional lending facilities you might have in place
We also mentioned the Epic Guide to Mortgages, which is our 9,500 word guide that shows you both how to get a mortgage and then pay it off more quickly.</description></item><item><title>The One Time You Might Want to Break Your Contract With The Bank | Ep. 131 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041463/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041463/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss Break Fees in regards to mortgages. A Break Fee is the cost that you pay if you have fixed your interest rate on your mortgage for a period, and then you restructure your mortgage before that fixed period has finished. This means you are breaking your contract with the bank.&amp;nbsp;
Bank's will allow you to do this for a fee, and they charge you the cost that they incur (or the lost profit/revenue) due to your breaking of the contract.</description></item><item><title>Which Bank Is Best For Investors? | Ep. 130 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041464/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041464/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Eugene Bartsaikin from Twine Financial Advisers. Eugene is a lending specialist and helps investors structure their lending and financial lives to achieve their goals.&amp;nbsp;
During the show, we discuss that banks don't treat investors differently. &amp;nbsp;When banks lend to investors they are required by the Reserve Bank to hold on to more capital than owner-occupiers.

It's easy to read stories of the strategies that millionaires or billionaires have used to build giant property portfolios .... and these can be great strategies. But, those same strategies aren't going to fit most everyday Kiwis.

This is a question that is frequently raised by newbie investors. They're thinking about moving to a city in the future and wonder whether they can lock in today's property prices, rather than pay more in the future.&amp;nbsp;

We discuss the reasons why this might be right for you, and how it may be better to continue with your current lifestyle rather than upending it all to buy property.&amp;nbsp;
First home buyers wanting to follow this strategy should be aware that they can't use their KiwiSaver to buy an investment property, but they can buy a property with their KiwiSaver for 6 months and then turn it into an investment property.</description></item><item><title>The Bank of Mum and Dad.

Turn-Key, where you pay a deposit, and then nothing else until the property has been completed
Progressive payments tend to work better if you want to change the property and customise it as you go, whereas in turn-key you have less ability to customise the property as you go.</description></item><item><title>3 Steps to Becoming A Property Investor in 2020 | Ep. 111 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041483/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041483/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the three steps to take if you want to become a property investor in 2020.

Only 24% of the property market is made up of investors, the rest is primarily made up of owner-occupiers, this has some important flow on effects in terms of how the market operates:
The property market has higher barriers to exit for owner-occupiers than there are in the share market. Property owners need to pay for a real estate agent to sell their house, which can be a real disincentive for property owners to get out of the market –&amp;nbsp;especially as it takes a median of 33 days to sell a property, whereas shares can be traded instantaneously.</description></item><item><title>Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage Before You Start Investing? | Ep. 107 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041487/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041487/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should pay off your personal mortgage entirely before you start investing in nz property. In short, the answer is generally no. The reason is multi-fold:
If you wait till you have paid off your mortgage entirely you won't have as long in the property market because you may have to wait, 10, 20 or 30 years before you get started – and the most important factor in the property market is the time spent in the market

Just treat capital growth as a bonus".
We discuss whether we agree with this advice or not, and the answer is generally: "no".
The reason for this is that you will need a significant number of cashflow positive properties to build the same amount of wealth generated from a capital growth property –&amp;nbsp;it is just not realistic that a property investor would be able to take on that many properties because of the bank's financing limits.</description></item><item><title>What Happens If You Buy The Wrong Property? | Ep. 105 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041489/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041489/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what happens if you make a bad investment and you pick up a property that either costs too much per week and is costing you money, or is not achieving the growth that you initially anticipated overtime?&amp;nbsp;

These are:&amp;nbsp;
Leveraged Returns –&amp;nbsp;when you invest in property, you are able to purchase an asset that is worth far more than the deposit you have put in. If you put in a 20% deposit, then you buy an asset that is 5x more valuable than your own deposit. The benefit of leveraged returns is that if that asset (property) goes up in value at 5% each year, that is 5% on the whole asset, which is 25% of your initial deposit.</description></item><item><title>Teardown: Is Investopedia's Advice Applicable to NZ? | Ep. 102 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041492/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041492/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether we agree with Invesopedia's top 10 tips for property investment.

Personal reasons
Fear and worry. For example, the worry that as the size of your portfolio increases, there is a greater risk of vacancy.
Lack of Time. If you're not out there looking for new properties then you are less likely to take action on one.&amp;nbsp;
Lack of Ambition. If you don't have a property coach working with you to achieve your goals then you might not hit them.</description></item><item><title>6 Events From The Last 20 Years That Have Impacted the Property Market | Ep. 88 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041506/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 23:43:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041506/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 6 events that have occurred over the last 20 years that have impacted the NZ property market, with a particular focus on the Auckland property market.&amp;nbsp;
Those 6 events are:
1. Leaky Homes Crisis
2. 67 Finance Companies Fell Over
3. Christchurch Earthquakes
4. LVR Restrictions Were Introduced
5. Brightline Tests Were Introduced
6. Introduction of the Internet and the Digital Economy

In pure economic terms, there can never be a shortage of any good in a free market, so long as demand and supply don&amp;rsquo;t significantly change. Under these conditions, if there are more buyers than sellers in a market then those buyers will bid the price up.</description></item><item><title>Why Your House Isn't An Asset | Ep. 86 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041508/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 03:05:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041508/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why your house isn't an asset, particularly when you begin to plan your retirement. The conclusion we come to is that the reason your house isn't an asset is that it doesn't produce any income. Sure, you can build wealth within your property, but you can never use it or unlock it unless you borrow against that wealth to pull the cash out to get started in property investment.</description></item><item><title>Area Update: Mt Wellington, Auckland | Ep. 85 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041509/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 01:18:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041509/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss Mount Wellington, a suburb in Auckland's property market. Our belief is that Mount Wellington has a very strong property market and makes a good hunting ground for good quality investments.
The median house price in Mount Wellington increased at a compounding rate of 8.35% between January 2000 and August 2018. And of the top 20 suburbs that grew the fastest over that period, Mount Wellington is the only suburb where the median house price is below $800K.</description></item><item><title>Why Property Investment is Ethical &amp; Desireable | Ep. 84 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041510/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 02:22:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041510/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we attempt to dispell the myth that property investment is undesirable for New Zealand (or any country). There are several reasons why we believe that property investment is good for the country:
440,000 of New Zealand's 525,000 rental properties are supplied by Mum and Dad investors (the private market). Every additional property that is supplied by private investors is another house that the government doesn't have to provide.</description></item><item><title>Top Takeaways From the 2019 OneRoof Property Report – Ep. 83 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041511/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 21:59:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041511/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the OneRoof Property Report for the last quarter of 2019.

These are:
The economy and job market is more diversified in the larger centres
The main centres tend to have higher population growth, even as a percentage. This helps to sustain housing demand, which pushes prices up.
There is a larger pool of potential tenants, so you're less at risk of vacancy
There is more infrastructure being built, which opens up opportunities for capital growth
Because of these other reason the major centres tend to be more stable and predictable than the other centres

Dennis has a lot of experience in property investment nz. &amp;nbsp;Here, we discuss 6 strategies you can use if you've got a property in mind, but haven't got the ability to get the lending. This include:
Get your house revalued (or do minor renovations to your property to increase the value of your owner-occupier home and then get it revalued)
Consider a co-ownership –&amp;nbsp;owning half the house with family and/or friends
Work with a money coach to decrease your expenses
Get a higher paying job/take on a secondary job/or get your partner to get back into the workforce if they haven't been working
Don't buy that property, but buy another one.</description></item><item><title>RBNZ Comments on the Bank's Servicing Test Rates | Ep. 80 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041514/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 03:58:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041514/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's recent comments on the banks' test servicing rates.

The Christchurch earthquakes were devasting for homeowners in the Canterbury region. Many were left unlivable and there was a severe housing shortage in the city.&amp;nbsp;
After homeowners were paid out, and the EQC had made repairs to properties, it was clear that there were still properties that needed work. This created the 'As Is' market.
These are properties that still require work and repairs before they can be brought up to code and to an acceptable standard.</description></item><item><title>Different Ways to Develop Land | Ep. 73 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041521/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041521/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Nick Johnstone a developer investor based in Christchurch. Nick walks us through a feasibility study he did on a piece of land.&amp;nbsp;
His options were to either demolish the existing property on the land and build three new units. Or, he could build a minor dwelling on the back of the property and rent it.&amp;nbsp;
He shows us why it made more sense for him to build the minor dwelling, which generated a smaller return, rather than going through a complex development process.</description></item><item><title>Jackson Asks: Why Do People Rent? | Ep. 72 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041522/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041522/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we answer another question from one of our youngest listeners, Jackson. Here he asks, why do people rent your houses? There several reasons why someone might rent from a property investor. These include not being at the stage of life where the person is ready and able to buy their own house, not wanting to take on debt, being transient or not being able to afford to buy in the city that a person wants to live in.</description></item><item><title>Jackson Asks: If I Have to Work For Money Now, What Will I Do When I Retire? | Ep. 71 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041523/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041523/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we answer a question from one of our youngest listeners, Jackson.

This is the situation where your property makes a cash loss each year after factoring in interest costs. Some property investors steer clear of negative gearing others embrace it.&amp;nbsp;
The fact is that negative gearing typically occurs when mortgage repayments are high and when investors have purchased their investment property with 100% lending. This means that no 'real' deposit has been used to secure the property and the only cash that has been put into the property comes from the investor's 'top-ups'.</description></item><item><title>Stop Thinking Your Going to Live In Your Investment | Ep. 69 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041525/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 08:37:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041525/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the fact that you're not going to live in your investment property, so you can't treat it as if you will.

We discuss that so many things can change over time in property. In 5 years you may be subject to stricter lending criteria, higher market prices or increased regulation.&amp;nbsp;

This question came from the Property Investment Chat Group NZ, a Facebook group where investors discuss property in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew walks through the reasons why it is generally better to get into investment property early rather than wait. And that it is typically better to pay off your own occupier mortgage before you pay down any investment debt.</description></item><item><title>Reserve Bank Update – What It Means For the Housing Market | Ep. 65 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041529/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 20:08:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041529/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss this week's Reserve Bank update. While not much changed from a policy perspective – the Official Cash Rate didn't change and the LVRs remained at their current levels – there were some key points made, which indicate future moves.&amp;nbsp;
The Reserve Bank indicated that a rate cut is likely to occur in February 2020 and that the bank would still like to see increased spending from the government and businesses.</description></item><item><title>Why The NZ Property Market is Unique | Ep. 64 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041530/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041530/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why the NZ property market is unique. We identify that because New Zealand is a long skinny country, which was colonised, our major cities are primarily port cities –&amp;nbsp;based around large bodies of water. This is true for Auckland, Tauranga, Dunedin, Wellington, New Plymouth –&amp;nbsp;and even Christchurch.
This means that there is an area the city can't expand into. This means that inner-city land becomes more desirable because the new suburbs are further and further away (compared to if the city could expand in a perfect circle.</description></item><item><title>Will Sacrifice Now or Later? | Ep. 63 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041531/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041531/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that property investment requires a sacrifice – an investment. It might sound obvious, but Andrew gives an example of a couple who wanted to invest in property but didn't want to sacrifice their current lifestyle.&amp;nbsp;

Property cycles are arguably one of the most important considerations when investing in property. However, they are very hard/impossible to predict.&amp;nbsp;
One of the key takeaways from the show is that the property cycle is not the same as the economic cycle. Where shares tend to fluctuate widely in value based on the economic cycle, this is not the same for property.</description></item><item><title>3 Real Life Case Studies – What Can Actually Happen | Ep. 61 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041533/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041533/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we give three real-life case studies about what can happen to property investors when they take the plunge.&amp;nbsp;
2 of the investors within these case studies achieved large gains in the value of their properties within the first 4-6 years of owning their investments. 1 of them is yet to see any substantial gain from their investment.

Mangere is one of Auckland's lower socio-economic areas, and may not typically have been where most investors would have thought to buy a property. However, there are a lot of good reasons to invest in properties that are located within the suburb.&amp;nbsp;
Over the last 18.5 years, Mangere properties have appreciated at a rate of 8.</description></item><item><title>What Do Property Managers Really Do? | Ep. 59 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041535/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041535/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the nitty-gritty of what property managers really do for property investors. Over a 10 year period, you are likely to pay your property manager the same amount of cash as you will your real estate agent. However, for that, you will get significantly more value and service.&amp;nbsp;
Celia estimates that over recent years the workload for a property manager has increased by 30%, however, they haven't increased their fees.</description></item><item><title>What is a Good Yield in Auckland? | Ep. 58 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041536/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041536/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what a good rental yield is for Auckland property investors. Nationally, we know that Auckland typically will deliver higher capital growth but lower yields.&amp;nbsp;
This depends on the type of property you have in Auckland, its location and then purchase price.&amp;nbsp;
While the national median yield is over 4%, in Auckland, we would typically think someone hitting 4% would be doing well.

Property management is so important because if you want to get the long term gains from investment property, then you need to hold the property for the long term.&amp;nbsp;
A big part of being able to do that is managing the property itself. That's where property managers come in.

These include all the utilities you need to cover e.g. water, power, internet. You'd also expect to pay for consumables like salt and pepper, shampoo, milk (all the creature comforts guests expect).
Property management is also more hands-on, which leads to higher costs. Management fees are also higher.

Jon shares that software is now available that allows Airbnb hosts to do the same thing.</description></item><item><title>The Yield You Can Get From an Airbnb | Ep. 52 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041542/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041542/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Jon Lawry from Urban Butler to discuss using Airbnb with property investment. This episode specifically covers the yield you can expect from an Airbnb.
Typically you can expect at least a 50% higher net yield from an Airbnb compared to a standard long term tenancy. It is, however, important to note that to generate these types of yields you need a property that will appeal to people who use Airbnb (apartments near the centre of town).</description></item><item><title>The Steps Involved in Buying a Property | Ep. 51 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041543/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041543/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the process of actually buying an investment property – after you've found the specific property that you want to buy. This includes the reports you need to get, the clauses that need to be negotiated, the back and forth that occurs when negotiating the price, and picking up the keys.&amp;nbsp;
There are over 150 different steps that make up the property buying process, and the trick is to know what's coming so you can prepare.</description></item><item><title>Hamilton – Is it a Good Place to Invest? | Ep. 50 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041544/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 23:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041544/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether Hamilton is a good place to buy an investment property. We specifically discuss the amount of infrastructure investment that is currently occurring in Hamilton. This includes the Ruakura Inland Port, The Waikato Expressway, and the value of assets held by the local iwi – Waikato Tainui.
We discuss that the average rate of median house price growth value in Hamilton suburbs over the last 18 years has been 6.</description></item><item><title>What Do You Need to Get Started in Property Investment? | Ep. 49 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041545/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041545/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss three different thresholds you need to meet in order to get started in property investment. This content comes from an article that Andrew recently wrote for Juno Investment magazine, which will be released as part of the next issue.&amp;nbsp;
After sharing the three thresholds, Andrew then shows how you can break the rules and invest anyway.&amp;nbsp;
These three thresholds are:

This episode is based on an article that Andrew recently wrote for the NZ Property Investor Magazine.&amp;nbsp;
In the article, Andrew compares a $500,000 new build, with an existing property purchased for $400K and then renovated for $50K (resulting in a renovated property with a $500K valuation).</description></item><item><title>Should You Be Able to Use KiwiSaver For Investment Property? | Ep. 47 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041547/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 03:58:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041547/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a recent idea that has been suggested by the Interim Retirement Commissioner –&amp;nbsp;should you be able to use your KiwiSaver to buy your first investment property (if you don't already own another property).
This is an important topic because we know that some groups in NZ are finding it hard to get onto the property ladder –&amp;nbsp;and yet the NZ superannuation was never meant to support accommodation costs, it was always assumed that these would be sorted.</description></item><item><title>How to Withdraw Your KiwiSaver | Ep. 46 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041548/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041548/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode – our last with Clara Kim from the Juno KiwiSaver Scheme – we discuss how to withdraw your KiwiSaver from your provider. This is very simple but slightly different based on the reason for your withdrawal (whether for your first home or for retirement).&amp;nbsp;
The other way you are able to withdraw your KiwiSaver is through an application for financial hardship. This is significantly more difficult and complex, which is the reason it was not discussed.</description></item><item><title>A Guide to KiwiSaver Funds | Ep. 45 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041549/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041549/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are again joined by Clara Kim from the Juno KiwiSaver Scheme.

These include Conservative, Balanced and Growth funds.

Median house prices are up 6.6% on the last year, but there is significant variation around the country. Manawatu-Wanganui us up 24.1%, but Auckland is only up 0.2% and the West Coast is down 7.5%.
We also go into depth about how median house prices are calculated and what they mean (and what they don't mean).</description></item><item><title>Which Suburb Had The Most Growth Over the Last 18 Years? | Ep. 40 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041554/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041554/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, I (Ed) quiz you on which suburbs had the highest and lowest growth over the last 18 years (Jan 2000 to Aug 2018).

When speaking with people nearing retirement, part of their plan is often to reduce their spending –&amp;nbsp;perhaps often to spend half as much as they currently do.&amp;nbsp;
The issue is that we spend more during the weekends and when we are on vacation. Retirement is the longest vacation of your life.</description></item><item><title>Queenstown Property Market Update | Ep. 38 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041556/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041556/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss the Queenstown Property Market.&amp;nbsp;
Queenstown has a unique property market due to the impact of tourism and its landscape. The lake and high mountains reduce the amount of land available for housing in central Queenstown, and hotels with big pockets crowd out some land that could otherwise be used for housing.&amp;nbsp;</description></item><item><title>Can You Get An Interest Only Loan Forever? | Ep. 37 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041557/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 02:44:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041557/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss whether you can get an interest-only loan forever.
The general rule of thumb is that an interest-only loan period will run for 5 years. At the end of those 5-years you can apply for another 5-year period.&amp;nbsp;
However, the bank will always consider whether you can afford the higher principal and interest payments once the interest-only period has finished.</description></item><item><title>Why You Might Not Get a Mortgage – Even If You Can Afford It | Ep. 36 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041558/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 04:57:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041558/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss that even if you think you can afford a mortgage at the current interest rates, the banks may not approve your application.&amp;nbsp;
The reason is that banks have higher servicing 'tests' that they run your mortgage application through. This means that even if you go on a 3.65% interest-only loan, they will test you on principal and interest at 6.</description></item><item><title>What Happens If Interest Rates Spike? | Ep. 35 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041559/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041559/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Josh Graham from Roost mortgages. In the show, we answer the questions we received from the audience at our recent Queenstown property investment seminar.
Here, we discuss what happens if interest rates were to spike. We start off detailing the reasons why we think interest rates are not likely to go up in the foreseeable future, before talking about how you can structure your investment properties and finances to protect against this eventuality.</description></item><item><title>Is It Cheaper to Use a Floating Interest Rate? | Ep. 34 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041560/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:24:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041560/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Josh Graham from Roost mortgages. In the show, we answer the questions we received from the audience at our recent Queenstown property investment seminar.
Here, we discuss whether it is cheaper to use a floating interest rate, rather than a fixed interest rate. The short answer is no. However, there may be a reason that some property investors or first home buyers might use a floating interest rate for a portion of their loan.</description></item><item><title>What Side of The Table Is Your Advisor On? | Ep. 33 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041561/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041561/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Dean Blair and Ed discuss who's best interests your advisor really has in mind. Traditionally, investment companies attract customers based on free advice. Advisors would then earn their income from receiving a commission if their clients purchased a specific product.&amp;nbsp;
Dean explains why this has meant that even well-meaning advisors will be seated on the opposite side of the table to the client, representing the best interests of their company and products.</description></item><item><title>What Should A Retirement Plan Look Like? | Ep. 32 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041562/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 03:48:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041562/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, Dean Blair and Ed discuss what a good retirement plan actually looks like. So often in the podcast, we discuss the need for a plan, but not what one contains.&amp;nbsp;

We agree that while it's never too late to get it sorted, the plans and tactics you use will be different based on your age and situation.&amp;nbsp;
The key part of any retirement plan is understanding the risks you are taking and clearly seeing your options.</description></item><item><title>Don't Be Dumb With Your Money | Ep. 30 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041564/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:17:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041564/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we welcome special guest, Dean Blair from FoxPlan to the show.

"when you die, will I get some of the properties?" This is an important question because one of the key reasons people get started in property investment is to build inter-generational wealth ... and leave an enduring legacy for their children.&amp;nbsp;
We discuss the need to set up wills, enduring power of attorneys, and the need to have proper insurance and risk mitigation programmes in place.</description></item><item><title>What To Look For In A Rental Property | Ep. 28 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041566/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 20:49:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041566/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what to look out for in a rental property. And it starts with understanding the type of investor that you are first –&amp;nbsp;whether you are looking for capital growth or whether you are looking for yield.&amp;nbsp;
If you're looking for yield, you'll realise that there are different tenancies that you could go for, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. We discuss room by room tenancies and Air BNB.</description></item><item><title>Maintenance – Fears That Stop People Investing | Ep. 27 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041567/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 04:07:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041567/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss maintenance. One of the biggest complaints landlords receive from tenants is deferred maintenance. That's where tenants have reported maintenance issues and they haven't been actioned by the landlord.&amp;nbsp;
The issue with maintenance is that it is hard to plan for. You don't know when things are going to break, what's going to break and how much it's going to cost. The only way to combat this is to budget and plan for it accordingly.</description></item><item><title>Jackson Asks: What Do You Do If You Don't Like Your Tenants? | Ep. 26 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041568/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041568/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what do you do if you don't like your tenants. And we move on to speak broadly about tenancy law in property investment. This episode was inspired by one of our youngest listeners, 7 year-old Jackson, who asked his Mum what to do in this situation.&amp;nbsp;
We cover the idea that your relationship with your tenant (as a landlord) is not a personal relationship, it is a business relationship, so it doesn't really matter whether you like them or not.</description></item><item><title>Vacancy – Fears That Stop People Investing | Ep. 25 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041569/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2019 04:28:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041569/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one of the key fears that stops people from investing in property – vacancy i.e. the fear of not having a tenant. This is a fear we often see. If a landlord doesn't have a tenant then they need to cover the costs of owning an investment property entirely by themselves –&amp;nbsp;the mortgage, rates, property management, insurance and maintenance. This would be crippling for many prospective Mum and Dad investors.</description></item><item><title>Should You Follow The Headlines In Investment Property? | Ep. 24 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041570/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041570/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should get your investment ideas and strategies for where tho invest from the headlines.&amp;nbsp;
We talk through the fact that by the time the newspapers are writing stories about high growth areas, it is often too late. And we discuss that for Buy and Hold investors, it is more important to look at a market's fundamentals rather than following the quicks wins that are often depicted in the media.</description></item><item><title>The Main 2 Investment Strategies You Can Use | Ep. 23 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041571/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 22:15:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041571/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that there are only 2 core property investment strategies: Buy and Hold, and Flipping. Most other strategies people use are variations of the two.
Buy and Hold investing is the 'get rich slow' strategy, where you buy an investment that you forecast will increase in value over time. Flipping is where you buy a property that is a bit 'run down' and then renovate it to increase its value.</description></item><item><title>NZ Parents Would Rather Talk About Drugs Than Money With Their Kids | Ep. 22 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041572/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 09:25:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041572/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a study that was conducted by the Commission for Financial Capability as part of Sortd Money Week in September 2019. The study showed that parents would rather talk with their kids about sex and drugs, rather than money.&amp;nbsp;
Parents would rather cover drugs (26%) and alcohol (27%) than tell their children how much they earned (14%) or talk about the risks of personal loans (12%).</description></item><item><title>Interest-Only Mortgages | Ep. 21 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041573/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 23:16:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041573/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why interest-only mortgages are the preferred loan used by property investors.&amp;nbsp;
We discuss how interest-only loans help you build your portfolio more quickly than using a principal and interest loan. And further, whether the banks are still lending on interest-only.

Rolleston is the largest town in the Selwyn District and is a 30-minute drive to Christchurch.

Both strategies involve leveraging your existing home to purchase an investment property. In essence, this means using the house to pay for itself.
In the first strategy, you purchase a capital growth property, which will go up in value quickly, though will also require a cash top-up each week.</description></item><item><title>5 Reasons Why Your First Home Mortgage Might Be Declined | Ep. #17 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041577/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041577/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #17, we discuss the 5 reasons why your mortgage application for your first home might be declined.

This means that all your eggs aren't in one basket.&amp;nbsp; We also touch on the fact that it is often better for your investment to be out of sight and out of mind so that it doesn't stress you out.</description></item><item><title>Should You Use Airbnb in Property Investment? | Ep. #15 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041579/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041579/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #15, we discuss AirBnbs, and the benefits and drawbacks of using your investment property for Airbnb only, rather than tenanting the property.
Andrew specifically walks through an example of the "sleep test" where, if you are struggling to get to sleep because you're worried about whether there will be bookings, then Airbnb is probably not a good option for you.&amp;nbsp;
We also discuss that while Airbnb can produce better cashflow returns than a standard tenant, it does come with higher costs and more uncertainty, which some investors may not be willing to accept.</description></item><item><title>Are Property Investors Greedy Psychopaths? | Ep. #14 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041580/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041580/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #14, we discuss whether property investors are "greedy psychopaths". Ed recently had an article published in Stuff, New Zealand's largest news website. One commenter wrote, "property investment (speculation really) is a cancer on society by greedy psychopaths."
We touch on that without property investors, many New Zealanders wouldn't have a place to live, since investors provide accommodation to renters.
Far from being greedy, we discuss how many property investors are using investment property to save for their retirement.</description></item><item><title>What Ring Fencing Means for Investors | Ep. #13 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041581/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041581/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode 13, we discuss Ring Fencing. This is a new piece of legislation that stops New Zealand property investors from claiming tax benefits they were previously entitled to.&amp;nbsp;
Under the previous regime, if a property investor made a tax loss each year, the investor could subtract the loss from their income tax. &amp;nbsp;This meant that they could claim a tax refund on the additional tax they had already paid.</description></item><item><title>Why You Should Cheat On Your Bank | Ep. #12 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041582/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 07:50:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041582/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode 12, we discuss split banking. Split banking is the process of using multiple banks, rather than just a single bank.&amp;nbsp;
Split banking means that you can protect your assets, control the proceeds of any sales you make, and potentially borrow more. This means you can grow your wealth and your portfolio faster.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew also shares a story of clients who didn't use split banking and got stung because of it.</description></item><item><title>What KPMG's Magnet City Report Means For Investors | Ep. #11 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041583/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041583/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode 11, we discuss KPMG's Magnet City report. Written in 2015, the global report introduces the concept of the Magnet City, a city that is expected to attract population growth of a particular type of people – young wealth creators.
Young wealth creators are those who will start businesses and create jobs, which improves the economy of a region.
This is important for property investors because magnet cities will make good property markets – they have growing populations of young people with higher than average incomes.</description></item><item><title>Don't Be Afraid Of Investing In a Flat Market | Ep. #10 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041584/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041584/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode 10, we discuss why you shouldn't be afraid of investing in a flat property market, where prices aren't increasing.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew quotes Warren Buffet: "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." And we talk through that investing in a market when prices are already going up means that another property owner receives the gains you might have achieved.
Although we're not suggesting you should invest in every and any flat market, we are suggesting that you shouldn't be automatically fearful.</description></item><item><title>Why Use a Mortgage Broker? | Ep. #9 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041585/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041585/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode 9, we discuss all the reasons why you would – and should – use a mortgage broker. That's whether you're a first home buyer or a property investor.&amp;nbsp;You may look around on the internet and look for a mortgage calculator, and then think you don't need a mortgage broker. However, mortgage brokers do more than just calculate your mortgage.
Mortgage brokers are your representative to the banks, and will go on your behalf to negotiate with multiple banks for you.</description></item><item><title>5 Sources First Home Buyers Can Use For Their Deposit | Ep. #8 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041586/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041586/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #8, we walk through the five sources first home buyers can tap into to pull together their deposits.

Most people become first-time property investors by leveraging their own homes to secure the deposit for their investment.&amp;nbsp;
In the episode, we discuss the way to do this: 1) take out a separate loan against your own home, 2) use the money from that &amp;nbsp;loan as a cash deposit to secure a secondary loan from another bank, 3) use the two loans together to fund the full purchase price of the property.</description></item><item><title>Investing In New v.s.

We specifically discuss the differences in what banks will lend you towards each type of property and the level of deposit you need for each.&amp;nbsp;
We also discuss the differences in tenants you might get, and why the decision actually depends on the investment property strategy you want to run with.</description></item><item><title>How Much You Need To Get Started | Ep. #5 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041589/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041589/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #5, we talk about how much you need to get started in property investment (and first homes).
This topic came from an audience member who was on our website and specifically asked how much they need to get started.
We've previously talked about the percentage amounts that people need to get started, but here we start to talk about the actual dollar amounts required.
In the episode, we recommended looking at median house prices in your region to get a feel for what the average property costs.</description></item><item><title>What The KiwiBuild Reset Means For First Home Buyers | Ep. #4 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041590/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041590/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #4, we talk about the Labour government's recent KiwiBuild Reset and what this means for First Home Buyers.&amp;nbsp;
We talk about the Welcome Home Loans, where First Home Buyers now only need a 5% deposit to purchase a house (terms and conditions apply).
We go through what those terms and conditions are, and touch on why property is more affordable now than it was a few years ago .</description></item><item><title>How Much You Can Make In Property ...

We also compare these returns to other types of investments.
We talk about the concept of leverage. We touch on how you can use the bank's money to purchase a property ... and then keep all the profits as the house increases in value.
We then speak about why property is one of the only asset classes where you can get '2 bites of the cherry.</description></item><item><title>NZ's Retirement Gap ... The Financial Equivalent of Climate Change | Ep. #2 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041592/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 01:11:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041592/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #2, we talk about the retirement gap, which is the significant gap between what Kiwis want to live on in retirement, and what they're actually on track to have.
The World Economic Forum, recently said that ageing populations and lack of savings are "the financial equivalent of climate change".&amp;nbsp;
We also cover why the retirement gap exists, how New Zealand's population is changing, and why many people in most rich countries will outlive their money by more than a decade.</description></item><item><title>Why We're Starting a Podcast + What We Hope to Achieve | Ep. #1 | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041593/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 22:03:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041593/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Episode #1, we talk about why we're starting a podcast. And&amp;nbsp;that reason is that Kiwis love talking about property, they love thinking about the property market. But, they don't necessarily know how to get the most out of it.&amp;nbsp;
That's shown by the number of pre-approvals for mortgages that New Zealanders get from mortgage brokers ... that don't end up getting used. That means that as a country, we're going out and saying we want to do something, but not always following through.</description></item><item><title>Should You Listen to the Property Academy Podcast? | The Property Academy Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041594/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041594/</guid><description>Podcast Description In this trailer, we tell you exactly what you can expect if you choose to listen to the Property Academy Podcast
