        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we unpack the potential impact of Auckland&#39;s Future Development Strategy on house prices. We discuss the council&#39;s preference for brownfields development (redevelopment of existing properties) over greenfields development (creating new suburbs from scratch). While this intensification might drive up the value of land suitable for redevelopment, we caution that these documents often don&#39;t have a significant impact on property investors. Instead, more impactful changes could come from actions like abolishing the Rural Urban Boundary.</description>

This makes real estate agents one of the least trusted professions. While there isn&#39;t similar data available in New Zealand, it&#39;s probably fair to assume that the numbers would be similar in New Zealand.</description>

That will decrease demand in the economy, bringing it back inline with supply, which will then help keep prices in check.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we answer a live listener question on the podcast. Here, we discuss whether you&#39;re able to borrow from the bank to subdivide your property.&amp;nbsp;
The answer is yes, most of the time ... but not all of the time. Some investors get caught out when managing their LVR position. Because once you subdivide your property, the original property isn&#39;t worth as much. So even if you have more equity, you might not meet the minimum equity requirements.</description>

This is because there are generally two types of developers in major subdivisions –&amp;nbsp;land developers and builders. Here, the builder doesn&#39;t pay the land developer until they&#39;ve sold and settled the house.</description>

Listen to the episode to learn the differences between the two, and what property investors need to know when purchasing investment properties with body corporates and resident&#39;s associations.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what you can do if you are contracted to settle on a new build ... but you can&#39;t settle because you no longer meet the banks criteria and can no longer get the loan.&amp;nbsp;
This is particularly top of mind given the LVR restrictions are set to change in March 2021.&amp;nbsp;
There are three things you can do: 1) apply for lending through the other major banks, 2) apply for lending through a 2nd tier lender, 3) use a deed of nomination so that another person settles the property instead of you.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041156/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to get the bank to renew your interest only loan. This is a critical topic, because sometimes your interest only period and your fixed interest period can get out of sync.&amp;nbsp;

This is important for investors to get their head around, because if you increase your repayments and allow the bank to shorten the documented term, then you will hurt your ability to get further lending for investment properties.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how one of split banking&#39;s greatest benefits – the ability to borrow more –&amp;nbsp;no longer exists. This was caused by the removal of the LVR restrictions by the Reserve Bank at the start of the first Covid-19 lockdown.&amp;nbsp;
So should you still do it? We suggest that you should, not just because of the other benefits of split banking, but also because the removal of the LVR limits are temporary.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041191/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we compare term deposits and property. Lower interest rates give a double boost to investment property. First, lower interest rates make investment property more profitable, since the interest on an investor&#39;s mortgage is usually the largest cost.&amp;nbsp;
The second is that lower interest rates decrease the return on term deposits, making property relatively more profitable, again, compared to the alternative. Throughout this show, we go through a deep dive into the numbers and compare the decisions that real investors are facing in the current market.</description>

Of particular interest is Labour&#39;s policy of regulating property managers, which has the potential to increase rents across the country as landlords take on more cost and a more professional standard of rental increases are applied across the country.&amp;nbsp;

Our determination is that population growth is not a significant indicator of capital growth ... however, it is still not to be ignored because it is still ab important driver of a landlord&#39;s ability to secure a tenant, along with other related factors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Tony Mounce from Tony Mounce Mortgages and Insurance to discuss interest rates. We go into detail about what causes interest rates to rise and fall and Tony&#39;s prediction about how long interest rates can stay low.&amp;nbsp;
Tony&#39;s main point is that interest rates are indicative of the supply and demand for money. Right now reserve banks are pumping money into the global economy which pushes down interest rates (the price of money).</description>

New Zealand currently ranks 26th out of 29 in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, for savings and investment. On average, Kiwis are on track to save -1.26% of our income in the next year. &amp;nbsp;We believe that if we can remove the stigma around investments and money then we can be part of the solution to turning that number around.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041240/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the bright-line test, which is New Zealand&#39;s version of a capital gains tax. While seemingly clear cut – sell a property (other than your own home) within 5 years and you&#39;ll be taxed – there are many fishhooks.&amp;nbsp;
For instance, if you show a pattern of buying and flipping your own home then you will be taxed on those transactions. If you inherit a property with a sibling but purchase your siblings half, then any gains on the extra 50% of the property are taxable if you sell within 5 years .</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether the number of bedrooms a property has impacts its capital growth. This is based on data shared by us by Core Logic, which was recently published in JUNO investing magazine.
We reach the conclusion that for apartments it makes a difference moving from 1 bedroom to 2 bedrooms, but for other numbers of bedrooms, or other property types ... it doesn&#39;t make that much of a difference.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the board game, Monopoly and what real investors can learn from playing the game. Some real-life lessons include:&amp;nbsp;
inflation – buy up big early in the game because you know the value of properties will go up over time as they become more valuablemanaging cash – not developing your properties too much too soon, in case you can&#39;t meet an unexpected expense, andnegotiation – people are much more willing to negotiate when they are in straightened circumstances.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041258/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we answer a question coming from a listener of the show about what Andrew would do differently if he was starting out from scratch again on a modest income.&amp;nbsp;
The main takeaway is that if you don&#39;t have equity, i.e. a deposit, that you&#39;ve got to get one ... and you&#39;ve got to build equity quickly. That would likely come from renovations and attempting to recycle their deposit as much as possible.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the difference between increases in the median value of a suburbs house price and the median capital growth achieved by investors.&amp;nbsp;
This is a small but important difference when you are making a decision about investing because when using headline figures you can&#39;t tell whether value increases have been achieved by new properties being developed or genuine underlying changes in the market.&amp;nbsp;
At the same time, it is important not to discount all data shown using the first method, because some data will also guide you better than none.</description>

The key benefit of &amp;nbsp;leveraged property is that you can invest with more money than you actually have sitting on your personal balance sheet. That means in the medium term you can get better gains than in an equivalent asset class e.g. shares even if they appreciate at a higher rate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the concept of hydraulicing, which is where a vendor will sell a property at a price that is higher than what the property is actually worth based on market fundamentals.&amp;nbsp;
An example of this is where a vendor would appear to sell a property at a high price, but would actually sell it to the purchaser for a much lower price. If the bank lends to the purchaser based on the higher price then it is possible for someone to purchase a property with no deposit at all.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the difference between a mortgage deposit and the deposit that is to be paid to a vendor ... and whether you need to pay both.&amp;nbsp;
In short, there is no double-up of deposit. The deposit you pay to your vendor makes up the deposit you use for your mortgage. In this case they are the same but for different purposes.
We also mention JUNO magazine&#39;s upcoming property issue, which will be released mid-August.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, which have just passed the Select Committee stage. This podcast is based on the report that has just been released by that select committee.&amp;nbsp;
On the positive side, some technical concessions have been made for landlords, such as the definition of what constitutes a large landlord have been tightened.&amp;nbsp;
On the other, the anti-social terminations clauses have been tightened making it even harder for landlords to evict poor-quality tenants.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041284/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how a combination of Air New Zealand&#39;s credits and the government&#39;s quarantining of international arrivals in hotels is having a positive impact on Airbnbs.
Air NZ&#39;s cancellation of overseas travel has given many New Zealanders flight credits which need to be used within two years. It&#39;s unlikely that the borders will open in time for &amp;nbsp;New Zealanders to use these credits on international travel, so instead, they are using them domestically.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041298/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss commercial property investment and how it differs from residential investment.&amp;nbsp;
The primary difference is that commercial property is primarily driven by yield and an assessment about the quality of the tenant as opposed to the quality of the property. This distinction is primarily caused by the fact that while the residential market is primarily made up of owner-occupiers (about 76% – only 24% are investors) the entire commercial market is made up of investors .</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041299/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy, which is a risk mitigation tactic. It involves slowly purchasing assets over time and consistently investing in the market in increments - since no one really knows when the market may take a sudden hit.&amp;nbsp;
Throughout the episode, we discuss the benefits (market timing) and drawbacks of this strategy. &amp;nbsp;Those drawbacks are primarily that following this strategy can mean less time in the market, which can be damaging for investors with relatively short investment time horizons.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what it means to become a commercial customer to the bank, along with the triggers of when you&#39;ll become a commercial customer.&amp;nbsp;
If you have lending for 5 or more properties with one bank – or total investment loans of more than $3 million, then the bank may transfer you so that your lending is held with the commercial division of the bank. That comes with higher interest rates and lower LVRs –&amp;nbsp;both bad things for residential property investors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one reason why house prices might not double over the next 10-15 years. This is based on the argument that house price inflation over the last 60 years in New Zealand has primarily been driven by one-off factors, that have cumulated to keep house prices rising.&amp;nbsp;
Here, we debate whether this will continue into the future and what one-off factors could happen in the future to spark further house price inflation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a new announcement from the Ministry of Social Development. In this announcement, the government will give up to $4,000 to tenants who are in rent arrears, who can&#39;t pay their rent and who are at risk of being evicted.&amp;nbsp;
This money needs to be paid back by the tenant, which has the effect of transferring the liability from the landlord to the government. This should make landlords feel much more comfortable because they&#39;ll know that if worst came to worst there may be another option.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there is an alternative to renovating properties as an investment strategy. This is a question Serena, a fellow listener of the podcast has asked.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve probably shied away from talking too much about the alternatives to renovation for fear of being too self-promotional on the podcast. So, because we were asked the question, we take the time here to talk about the method of buying new or near new properties in growing cities and holding them for the long term.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss proposed changes to New Zealand&#39;s Building Act, which will mean that low-risk works will no longer require council consent.&amp;nbsp;
This will save investors on average $2,000 per project, while also saving time. That means that councils can spend more time assessing and pushing through higher risk consents. These changes are likely to be passed in late August, which will also cut red-tape for pre-fabricated homes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss and compare the apartment markets in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington, to determine which have the greatest potential to rise and which have the greatest potential to fall.
Our conclusion is that the Christchurch and Wellington apartment markets are more likely to hold value compared to the Auckland apartment market. This is because apartments in these cities are more likely to be owner by owner-occupiers, have less reliance on international tourism and the international student market, and because of (in Wellington&#39;s case) a reliance on government employers, which are less likely to call for redundancies.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the pros and cons of owning student rentals. This is a question that&#39;s come in from a fellow listener of the podcast.
Throughout the show we share the three different types of student rentals:
Standard student flats, which tend to be higher-yielding, but much higher maintenancePurpose-built room by room rentals, which are higher-yielding, but get lower capital growth since they are an investor specific productStudent apartments (standard apartments) which tend to be between the two of themWe also mention that there is now a new form where you can recommend a podcast topic for us to talk about.</description>

This episode is based off a question one of our property partners received from a Kiwi property investor based in France.&amp;nbsp;
The key takeaway is that you need to know the difference between a suburb&#39;s median sale price and the median house value.
We then talk about how you can use these interactive maps in Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton and Wellington when investigating any suburb to invest in.</description>

        <title>How Easy Is It For Overseas Kiwis to Buy Property In New Zealand? | Ep. 259 | The Property Academy Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/2621041335/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041335/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether it is easy or hard for New Zealanders living overseas to buy property in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
Generally, the toughest issue is to get lending from banks in order to purchase property. Overseas investors are typically restricted to 65-70% of lending on properties, and their income is scaled back under the tests to 60-90% of usual income. That range is based on which country the borrower is located in and the risk of currency fluctuation.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041337/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the NZ median house price can increase, even if house prices across the country decrease. This seeming anomaly is based on how the median house price is calculated. This measure of average does not track differences in the distribution of houses sold across the country.&amp;nbsp;
If a higher proportion of Auckland houses are sold within a given month the median house price will increase, even if fundamental house prices do not increase over the same period.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041338/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss when you can sell 1 property to buy 2 properties. Banks have internal LVRs that restrict how much they are willing to lend against certain types of properties.&amp;nbsp;
Holding these asset types takes up a lot of equity in an investors portfolio, which means that in some cases an investor can sell one property in order to buy two more. These are often niche investments, such as bare land, hotel units and small apartments.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss Rent to Buy schemes and how they have the potential to benefit and harm both the vendor and the potential purchaser.
In a Rent to Buy property-purchasing structure, a vendor will agree to sell a purchaser a property for today&#39;s price, but the purchaser does not have to pay for the property for a number of years (e.g. 5 years). Over that time, the purchaser will pay market rent to the vendor, plus an additional amount, which counts as part of the deposit.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041343/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the concept of overcapitalisation, what it is and how you can avoid it. In simple terms, overcapitalisation is where you spend more money to renovate a property, but you get less out of the property than what you&#39;ve spent.
This applies to any dollar that you&#39;ve spent on a property and not seen a return on that dollar (that is anywhere, where you have spent a dollar and not seen your property increase in value by a dollar).</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041345/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the BNZ&#39;s recently announced changes to its lending policy. These policies govern how much the retail bank is willing to lend on different property types.&amp;nbsp;
Most interesting for property investors, the bank will only lend a maximum of 70% of a property&#39;s value for any investment property. This includes any properties that would have been exempt under the previous LVR rules, like new builds and the dollar for dollar exemption.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the property market is operating now that the country has come out of lockdown. This stems from a recent article Andrew provided comment for in The Press and for Stuff.co.nz (read the article here).
We are seeing pent up demand coming onto the market, which likely stems from: a) the property market not being able to function during lockdown. 8 weeks worth of demand is now hitting the market in one week.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041347/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the property market performed during the Coronavirus-induced lockdown. This is based on data recently released by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
As predicted, volumes massively dropped during April 2020, down just under 79% year on year. However that decrease is not spread evenly, Auckland&#39;s volumes, decreased just under 69% year on year. That is in part the reason why the median house price continued to rise to a record price of $680,000.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041348/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss inequality and the difference between how different suburbs appreciate in value. Even if different suburbs appreciate at the same rate, if there were small differences in their initial starting values, one suburb can become more expensive than others within the same city.&amp;nbsp;
This means that homeowners in one suburb can see their wealth increase at a much faster rate than homeowners in a neighbouring (slower growth) suburb.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041349/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how you can create a self-funding property portfolio. Generally, in property investment, there are two types of properties that you want to buy –&amp;nbsp;capital growth properties that tend to grow in value quickly and yield properties that produce more cashflow.&amp;nbsp;
The trouble for most New Zealanders is that to invest in property they need to borrow the entire purchase price of a property. This typically means that capital growth properties will be cashflow negative.</description>

Build up a &#39;mojo&#39; or emergency savings accounts. Initially set this up with $2,000. Then, when you can, build it up to 3 months worth of expenses. This will give you added confidence that you can weather financial storms, and allows you to take more riskGet revolving credit accounts in place.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what &#34;Good Fundamentals&#34; actually means. It&#39;s common to hear that you should buy properties in areas with &#39;good fundamentals&#39;, but often it&#39;s not defined what that actually means.&amp;nbsp;
For us it means:
high population growthtight supplyhigh demandhigh average incomeslow unemployment and a diversified economyWe also walk through the data showing which of New Zealand&#39;s regions tend to have these good fundamentals.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Darcy Ungaro from Ungaro and Co. and the NZ Everyday Investor Podcast.
Here, we discuss how investor behaviour is changing. Falling interest rates are causing investors to look at higher risk assets in order to get a return on their investment. This decreases yields in general and forces all investors to move towards slightly riskier assets than they were previously investing in.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the numbers you really should be looking at when you invest in property ... Return on Equity and Return on Cash.&amp;nbsp;
When you invest in property there are two parts to your investment – the equity you initially put in, and then any cash you invest to top up the mortgage. It makes sense then to base your investments on these two factors, given that we each have a limited amount of cash and equity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the RBNZ&#39;s recently announced LVR changes and what they mean for property investors in New Zealand.
We also discuss what a high LVR loan means for borrowers in terms of additional costs. For instance, often when a borrower takes on the lending of more than 80% of the value of a property, they will either pay an upfront fee ... or a higher interest rate.</description>

        <title>5 Reasons Why The Property Market Might Not Fall In Value As Much As You Think | Ep. 234 | The Property Academy Podcast</title>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041360/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 5 reasons why the property market in New Zealand may not drop in value by as much as you would otherwise think. These reasons are:
The drop in interest rates make it cheaper for homebuyers and investors to purchase property. Lower interest rates also decrease the return from term deposit, which encourage investors to seek yield in the property marketFirst home buyers are able to save money throughout the lockdown and are likely to form new savings habitsInvestors are likely to move their focus from New Zealand&#39;s regions and instead pull back to the major cities, which have more diversified economies and have greater prospects for employmentSimilarly, investors are likely to move their focus from commercial property to residential propertyThe Reserve Bank&#39;s increase in the money supply through the Large Scale Asset Purchasing Programme is likely to create a Cantillon effect, where investors seek higher yielding assets, which will likely push up the price of shares and propertyBonus: the loan to value ratio restriction are being removed, which allow investors to invest with more freedom.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041361/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss split banking and why you can get more money from the bank if you cheat it on it with another.&amp;nbsp;
This is because when you have all your lending with one bank, they cross secure the assets and you can only borrow a maximum of 70% against the value of your investment properties. But, if you move that lending across to another bank, you&#39;re able to borrow up to 80% of the value.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 5 different strategies that you can use to pass the bank&#39;s servicing stress test. Whenever you apply for a mortgage from the bank, the institution will stress-test your application through different criteria.&amp;nbsp;
If you don&#39;t have enough income to pass these stress tests, you can improve your position by decreasing your expenses ... not by spending less, but by restructuring your financial payments.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a new data source from QV that investors can use when considering investments in different areas.&amp;nbsp;
While the tool can give broad insight into gross yields across multiple suburbs, we do question their usefulness when applied with a broad brush across the whole suburb. Better to use the additional features to dig down into the number of bedrooms and type of property you are considering.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a particular proportional property ownership model that is currently being promoted by a property investment company within New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
The model includes purchasing a residential property outright, without any debt –&amp;nbsp;the investment divided into 12 equal shares and offered to investors. The benefit of this model is that an investor can get exposure to the property market for a lower entry price. The cons are that when a property is purchased without debt, there is no opportunity for leverage .</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Reserve Bank&#39;s recent announcement that it will scrap the Loan to Value Restrictions for a period of 12 months.&amp;nbsp;
This will have a massive stimulatory effect on the property market as: investors will have more ability to borrow against their existing portfolios to buy more property. They&#39;ll also be able to purchase more property using that lending.

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why first and second home buyers often can&#39;t buy a do-up and why that presents an opportunity for property investors.
A common misconception is that when first home buyers purchase a do-up that they can borrow the renovation costs as well ... because the property will soon be worth more. That&#39;s not the case, you cannot borrow renovation costs, unless you already have more than a 20% deposit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss different ways to live off your property portfolio. There are four ways we discuss, each with their pros and cons:
Using a reverse mortgage to live off the equity within your propertiesUsing a principal and interest mortgage to pay down debt to create a decent rental yield you can live offBuying multiple properties, selling half and paying off the mortgage on the rest to create a rental yieldRestructuring your portfolio when you need the cash from one geared towards capital growth to one geared towards yieldOur conclusion and preferred option is that the last option best suits most Kiwi buy and hold investors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how you can go from 2 properties to 5 properties and beyond. At some point, many investors hit a wall and the bank stops lending to them. No lending = no new investment properties.&amp;nbsp;
But, unless you understand why the bank isn&#39;t lending you more money, it&#39;s very hard to fix it. Worst of all if you keep applying for lending and get denied your credit record will continue to disintegrate – making it harder for you to get lending in the future.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should buy an investment property from Golden Homes.&amp;nbsp;
Golden homes sits at the slightly premium end of the market relative to other competitors such as GJ Gardiner, Mike Greer and Stonewood Homes, which the price reflects. They have some initiative finance models, that makes the purchase price cheaper than they otherwise would be, which provides benefits for those who can afford the slightly higher purchase price.</description>

This was the most popular question in our recent webinar that considered all of New Zealand&#39;s regions, considering which would be the most resilient property markets.&amp;nbsp;
Our view is that Auckland, as the centre of the most jobs and economic activity, will always handle any economic downturn better than other regions in NZ.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041383/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we answer a listener&#39;s question, which stems from an earlier episode we recorded. In that episode (#208) we discussed three speculative scenarios, where increases to debt availability would lead to higher house prices.&amp;nbsp;
Paul (the listener) asked why increased availability of debt would lead to higher house prices as it wouldn&#39;t change the fundamental value of the property.&amp;nbsp;
During the show, we discuss that there isn&#39;t really a fundamental value of property, given that home-buying decisions are primarily driven by emotion, rather than rational thought.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what happens if you come to settle a property, and it is worth less than the purchase price?
This is most important for investors who have signed an unconditional contract to purchase a brand new property that is currently under construction.
If we do go through a period of economic downturn due to the Coronavirus, then there may be a situation where some investors come to settle a property (12 months after going unconditional), and the property is now worth less than the purchase price.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Peter Norris from Lateral Partners to discuss the Mortgage Holiday Scheme that is currently available as part of the economic response to the Coronavirus.&amp;nbsp;
Property owners need to remember that the mortgage holiday is not really a holiday at all, but rather a deferral. The payments will still need to be made, but you make them at a later date. Remember too that any delayed interest payments will incur additional interest.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how median rents in New Zealand hit a record high in February 2020. In that month the median rent hit $520 per week, up from $495 the year before.&amp;nbsp;
That equates to a 5.1% increase over 12 months, compared to general inflation of 1.6%. That means that rents are increasing at a faster rate than all other goods. That&#39;s bad news for tenants as more of their income will then be going towards rent.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how the Coronavirus might change your investment strategy. The decrease in interest rates have two effects:
They decrease the return savers get through term depositsThey increase the return property investors get through lower borrowing costsIt is not likely that property investors can get a higher cash return from their deposit as opposed to keeping their money in the bank. These small changes in interest rates can have a big impact to the bottom line.</description>

The Reserve Bank has announced a $30 billion programme to purchase government bonds on the secondary market. This programme will operate over 12 months to decrease long term interest rates.
That will likely have three effects:
Lower long term interest rates will decrease the government&#39;s borrowing costs, making it cheaper to borrow and conduct expansionary fiscal policy</description>

From Micky&#39;s view, the Christchurch market has been flat for the last 3 years and he is seeing pent up frustration that is leading to house price inflation.</description>

Some New Zealanders are doing it tough at the moment, struggling to get by. As landlords, that may include some of our tenants. That means that there is more risk that our tenants won&#39;t make their rental payments.&amp;nbsp;

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we share the advice we are currently giving to clients while they are under isolation as part of New Zealand&#39;s coronavirus outbreak.
The first is that it is best not to sign a contract to purchase property throughout this isolation period. That&#39;s because you won&#39;t have the opportunity to conduct due diligence properly while in isolation. You can&#39;t conduct a valuation, or do a site visit, lawyers will likely be slow and banks inundated with other requests.</description>

In addition to this, the agent will be nurturing the prospective purchasers of your property, so you want to have a sense that they will do this well to get more potential buyers interested so they bid up the price.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss gentrification. Gentrification occurs when a suburb or town begins to become more trendy and upmarket because the type of people who live in that area changes.&amp;nbsp;
This is often the cause of long term social change, but also because of the fundamentals of the suburb or area.&amp;nbsp;
Take Auckland&#39;s Ponsonby. Decades ago the suburb was considered a place for blue-collar workers to live.</description>

Buying rules are a concept in property investment where you set some restrictions about the sort of properties that you will and won&#39;t buy.
Because property investment can become emotional, some investors will think &#39;but, I really like this house&#39; and buy it anyway ... even if the purchase doesn&#39;t stack up from a numbers perspective.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether using equity in your home to purchase an investment property will increase your mortgage repayments.&amp;nbsp;
When you use equity frim within your home to purchase an investment property, you typically take out a separate loan against your property, which is sometimes in the structure of a mortgage top-up.&amp;nbsp;
You then use this loan as the deposit for your new investment property.&amp;nbsp;
Because you have taken out additional lending, there will be additional repayments against that mortgage.</description>

Many listeners will think back to the 80&#39;s and remember how high interest rates were at the time. Some even treat it like a competition.&amp;nbsp;
It was not uncommon at the time to see interest rates of 18-26%.
Naturally, anyone who ever paid interest at that level is likely wondering &#39;how low can interest rates stay low?</description>

Being the good economist he is, Tony identifies that, as long as there isn&#39;t government interference in a market in the form of price controls, a free market can never have a technical shortage.
Why?
Because the market price will adjust to balance supply and demand.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the turnaround time it takes to get a mortgage approved in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
Right now the banks can take up to 7 business days to open your email to and start to process your mortgage. They are incredibly short-staffed, but demand is also increasing.&amp;nbsp;
Typically due diligence on a brand-new off-the-plan property will last 10 days. That means that there are only three days left for the bank to approve your mortgage for an investment property.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we reveal exactly how property coaches get paid and a few common misconceptions about property coaches.&amp;nbsp;
There are different types of property coaches. Some like us source properties on your behalf and therefore will earn a commission when you choose to invest in a property. Others will charge you a fee to teach you how to do that sourcing and any renovations yourself.&amp;nbsp;
While we at Opes Partners do not charge a fee for our service, some in our industry do charge you a fee to put together your strategy.</description>

Perhaps there&#39;s something in the back of your mind holding you back from investing.

You might think: What happens if I suddenly lose my job? Or what happens if I don&#39;t have a tenant for a long time?</description>

So very few people participate in the legislative process.
That means that your submission represents a large proportion of submitters.

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss another difference between investing in small towns and larger cities – deferred capital maintenance.
Every investor accepts (and hopefully budgets for) the fact that their properties will require maintenance throughout the year. However, we also know that from time to time investment properties will require capital maintenance, especially if the property is older.&amp;nbsp;
This could be the replacement of a roof, painting the outside of the property, rewiring the house, or some other major works.</description>

A sunset clause is typically used in a sale and purchase agreement to protect the buyer of a property that has not been built yet. Using this clause, if a developer has not completed the build by a certain date, then the purchaser has the right to cancel the contract.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the 6 things that can go wrong with investing in brand new properties and how to solve them.
1. Overpaying for a property – solve it by getting a valuation before going unconditional
2. Not being able to secure a tenant because of too may properties coming on market at the same time&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;solve it by investing in a staged development
3. Can&#39;t get started straight away –&amp;nbsp;realise that this is a misconception because although you won&#39;t have a tenant straight away, you still have&amp;nbsp;</description>

The West Coast region, for instance, has a total of almost 4 years worth of properties already on the market. No additional West Coast properties could come on the market, and there would still be properties available for buyers for another 4 years, given today&#39;s sales volumes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should not buy property, or put off that decision because of Coronavirus. In general, the answer is no. While the media has made a big deal of the potential impacts the likelihood of a widespread outbreak is still low-to-medium in New Zealand.
On top of that, we expect a decrease in the OCR, which should stimulate spending and help property buyers and homeowners.</description>

        <title>Why You Want Your Development to Have a Mix of Investors and Owner Occupiers | Ep. 171 | The Property Academy Podcast</title>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041423/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why it is preferred to have a mix of owner-occupier and investors within your development.&amp;nbsp;
This is generally for three reasons:
You want to sell your property to an owner-occupier in the future, who is likely to be more emotionally invested than an investor, so you want a property that is going to appeal to an owner-occupierWhen the properties are finished, you don&#39;t want your properties to be untenanted because all the properties come on to the rental market at the same timeowner-occupiers are more likely to look after the neighbourhood than tenantsHowever, we also discuss how this will change based on the type of property.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the four different titles that are used in the New Zealand property market. These are:
Freehold, also known as fee-simple. This is the most common type of ownership in New Zealand where you own the land and you are generally free to do what you like with it, subject to any caveats, covenants, or local bylawsLeasehold –&amp;nbsp;this is where you own the building on the land, but you rent the land from another party.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041425/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that it is often thought that smaller towns will deliver yields that are x2 as high as bigger cities. While that might be true for gross yields, this is generally not true of net yields.&amp;nbsp;
That is because smaller town properties often have higher costs as a proportion of the rent. For instance, if you were to buy two properties that are exactly the same, one in a small town and another in a big city, you would likely spend the exact same amount on maintenance.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the 3 different types of property trading strategies you can use.&amp;nbsp;
Previous listeners have asked whether renovation is the same thing as trading. The truth is that renovation is a type of trading, but there are other types of trading also used by property investors. These are:
Renovating existing properties and selling them back on to the marketBuying a property and selling it to another investor at a profitBuying a property and selling it straight back on to the marketThere are different circumstances that would lead to each of these strategies being used, which we discuss on the show, as well as what you would need to have to execute these three different strategies.</description>

We discuss the trends in house price growth, specifically identifying that suburbs in the inner-city tend to grow the slowest on average because they are full of apartments, which don&#39;t grow as quickly. There are hot spots in the inner-west suburbs, and that tends to be true for most central Auckland suburbs.</description>

Capital gains – changing market conditions increase the value of your property. This happens slowly but it is consistent. That is why capital gains will often give you the greatest gains, even though you don&#39;t have control over it.&amp;nbsp;Instant equity – this is where you actively do something to the property to create an instant initial equity gain.</description>

If they are in a secure financial position so they don&#39;t fall over throughout the projectWhat their quality of finish of their previous builds are like, and if they are consistent with the plansWhether they are good to deal with and are likely to come to the party if a disagreement occursWhether their building design is diverse.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what the Rule of 20 is in retirement planning and how it works.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;This is a rule of thumb, which says that once you decide the level of retirement income you want, multiply it by 20 and that is the number of freehold assets you need to produce the income you want.&amp;nbsp;
That means if you want to live on $100,000 a year, you&#39;ll need roughly $2,000,000 worth of assets to produce that level of income every year in perpetuity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how BNZ is no longer offering pre-approvals to non-bank customers. This has some far-reaching implications for property investors and mortgage brokers.&amp;nbsp;
It likely means that investors and homebuyers will find the property they want first and sign it conditional to finance before taking the property to the bank. This means that the bank will prioritise the deal.&amp;nbsp;
It is also an indication of strength in the banking and property sector .</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041444/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why properties are sometimes more expensive when you buy a property through a property coach than if you look on a developer&#39;s website.&amp;nbsp;
The reason this is sometimes the case is that developers will exclude some parts of the property from that price. For instance, you might see a property for $499K, but it might exclude the driveway, landscaping or the letterbox. If you wanted it all included, it might cost $525K.</description>

Issues with lending, broken down into – Interest rates rising increasing your expenses, not being able to get borrowing from the bank, and not being able to have interest-only loans renewedVacancy and tenancy problems – what if your rental property is turned into a P-lab or attracts unsavoury tenants?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss ringfencing, what it is and how property investors can combat these recent tax changes.&amp;nbsp;
From April 2019 property investors haven&#39;t been able to claim rental property losses against their income. Previously investors were able to claim a tax refund on any losses made by their rental property. That meant that if the property was negatively geared the tax could make it cheaper to own a rental property.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041448/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss depreciation. Depreciation is when the value of the things inside your home gradually decrease in value. It&#39;s a cost to you as an investor, but you don&#39;t actually pay for it in cash. This means that you can use depreciation to decrease the amount of tax you pay to the IRD each year.&amp;nbsp;
Since the 2011-2012 financial year investors have no longer been able to claim depreciation on the value of their building (if it has a useful life of 50 years or less).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss interest-only loans – how to get them, how the banks treat them in today&#39;s market and when investors should use them.
Many investors today question whether they can still get an interest-only mortgage in today&#39;s market. The answer is yes. But, the interest-only mortgages of today are different from those of the past.&amp;nbsp;
Previously, it was possible to secure a 30-year interest-only mortgage. Now, the maximum is 5-years attaches to a standard principal and interest table loan.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to tell if the property investment advice you are receiving is bad advice. This comes off the back of a recent client story, where our property coaching client received poor accounting and portfolio structuring advice from their brother. Although a capable small business accountant –&amp;nbsp;the brother in question was not a tax or property specialist, which was causing our client&#39;s property portfolio to be costing more than it should have.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to choose a property coaching company. Every property coaching company is likely to recommend and promote a specific strategy for their clients. Some will promote buy and hold strategies, others focus on renovation and others, still, on development.&amp;nbsp;
We suggest that first-time property investors looking for a property coach should look at other clients who are using the property coaches and look at the strategies those clients are implementing.</description>

We discuss the different approaches to building a property investment portfolio and run through a case study of a couple who are able to achieve their financial goals over 20 years by investing in just 3 properties.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041454/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how to spot a slump in the property market, with specific reference to Christchurch and the Canterbury earthquakes. Our key takeaway is that although we can all identify what a slump looks like in the text books, a real property slump (especially in the main centres) looks less like a downturn and more like a prolonged stagnation / flattening of property prices.&amp;nbsp;
We present a new model for looking at and considering slumps, which comes from Tony Alenders&#39;s economic reports.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there is an oversupply of property in Christchurch –&amp;nbsp;with specific reference as to whether Christchurch might turn into a &#39;donut-city&#39;, where the centre of the city lacks development.&amp;nbsp;
We make specific reference to the Canterbury earthquakes. These are the primary cause for higher development in the suburbs and satellite towns than in Christchurch central up until recently.&amp;nbsp;
We also discuss the Epic Guide to Mortgages, our 9,500-word guide that teaches you both how to get a mortgage –&amp;nbsp;and then pay it off more quickly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the Christchurch suburb of Addington and whether we believe it is a good place to invest.&amp;nbsp;
Addington has had the 3rd fastest house price growth of any Christchurch suburbs since the turn of the century. The only two suburbs that grew at a faster rate were the wealthier suburbs of Strowan and Fendalton. These suburbs wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for investors to necessarily park their money in.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041457/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a question sent in my another listener, which says: &#34;I already have an investment property in Whangarei, should I buy another one there, or sell my existing investment property and buy in the main centre?&#34;
Often the main centres aren&#39;t as expensive as one might think. Median sale prices can be misleading as your investment property doesn&#39;t have to be the median property. Similarly, small towns like Whangarei are actually more expensive than properties in cities like Christchurch at the moment.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there is such a thing as cashflow positive or negative properties. This question came in from a listener of the show. We agree that there is no such thing as a cashflow positive or negative property ... sure there are high yielding properties, but whether a property produces cash or not is based on how you have structured your investment. If you borrow with 100% lending and your property is geared for capital growth it will usually provide a cash loss.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one of the key fears that stops people from investing in property –&amp;nbsp;the market. Or, rather, fear that the market is going to crash and that property prices will drop suddenly and significantly.
We compare economist predictions from January 2009 with real data about how the property market performed and show that generally the hysteria often seen in newspapers rarely plays out in practice.</description>

The first is a Christian couple who were regularly giving to the church. Eugene identified that their long term ambition was to be more generous and give more to their community. Eugene encourages them to put more away towards their mortgage today (by tithing less) so that they can build their wealth and give more over their lifetime.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss Break Fees in regards to mortgages. A Break Fee is the cost that you pay if you have fixed your interest rate on your mortgage for a period, and then you restructure your mortgage before that fixed period has finished. This means you are breaking your contract with the bank.&amp;nbsp;
Bank&#39;s will allow you to do this for a fee, and they charge you the cost that they incur (or the lost profit/revenue) due to your breaking of the contract.</description>

Unfortunately, the family member has had mental health issues, which has caused serious tension and has impacted the aunt&#39;s wellbeing to the point where her decision making has been severely impacted.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how every property investment strategy can be a good strategy depending on the circumstances and the situation. It&#39;s easy to read stories of the strategies that millionaires or billionaires have used to build giant property portfolios .... and these can be great strategies. But, those same strategies aren&#39;t going to fit most everyday Kiwis.
Similarly, the strategies that everyday Kiwis use and implement wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for millionaire property investors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should ever think about moving into your investment properties? This is a question that is frequently raised by newbie investors. They&#39;re thinking about moving to a city in the future and wonder whether they can lock in today&#39;s property prices, rather than pay more in the future.&amp;nbsp;
Generally, this isn&#39;t the best idea. If you buy an investment property with the intention of living in it, emotion can start to cloud your decision making.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that your first home might actually be an investment property – you don&#39;t actually have to live in it.&amp;nbsp;
We discuss the reasons why this might be right for you, and how it may be better to continue with your current lifestyle rather than upending it all to buy property.&amp;nbsp;
First home buyers wanting to follow this strategy should be aware that they can&#39;t use their KiwiSaver to buy an investment property, but they can buy a property with their KiwiSaver for 6 months and then turn it into an investment property.</description>

More often than not, it is your parents increasing the size of their mortgage on their own property in order to give you enough of a deposit to top up your deposit.</description>

Only 24% of the property market is made up of investors, the rest is primarily made up of owner-occupiers, this has some important flow on effects in terms of how the market operates:
The property market has higher barriers to exit for owner-occupiers than there are in the share market. Property owners need to pay for a real estate agent to sell their house, which can be a real disincentive for property owners to get out of the market –&amp;nbsp;especially as it takes a median of 33 days to sell a property, whereas shares can be traded instantaneously.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a piece of advice which can be found in nz property investment books from the 1990s to early 2000s, which goes something like this: &#34;only focus on cashflow, don&#39;t worry about capital growth. Just treat capital growth as a bonus&#34;.
We discuss whether we agree with this advice or not, and the answer is generally: &#34;no&#34;.
The reason for this is that you will need a significant number of cashflow positive properties to build the same amount of wealth generated from a capital growth property –&amp;nbsp;it is just not realistic that a property investor would be able to take on that many properties because of the bank&#39;s financing limits.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the three types of leverage that every investor needs to know. These are:&amp;nbsp;
Leveraged Returns –&amp;nbsp;when you invest in property, you are able to purchase an asset that is worth far more than the deposit you have put in. If you put in a 20% deposit, then you buy an asset that is 5x more valuable than your own deposit. The benefit of leveraged returns is that if that asset (property) goes up in value at 5% each year, that is 5% on the whole asset, which is 25% of your initial deposit.</description>

A lot of property investment education (online) is specifically geared towards the US market.&amp;nbsp;The US market has totally different dynamics to New Zealand, and the figures, yields and general rules of thumb are totally different.This means that when ratios, yields and purchase prices are suggested in these articles you need to take them with a real grain of salt as they may not apply.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss several conversations Ed has recently had with his cab drivers about property investment nz, specifically about age. This is important because a bank may not be willing to lend money to someone nearing retirement because if that person was to stop working then they may not be able to afford their mortgages.&amp;nbsp;
For instance, say that a person was 65 and borrowed $500,000 to purchase an investment property on a 30 year term.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we walk through the 6 exemptions to the LVR rules, which allow you to borrow above the standard lvr restrictions set by the reserve bank.
These are:&amp;nbsp;
Not all bank lending needs to be within the LVR rules –&amp;nbsp;only 80% of owner-occupier lending and 95% of investor lending needs to fall within the LVR rules. This means that 20% of owner-occupier lending and 5% of investor lending can fall outside the 20% deposit requirement for owner-occupiers and 30% deposit requirement for investorsNew builds are exempt from investor LVR NZ rules –&amp;nbsp;If you purchase a brand new property then you won&#39;t be subject to LVR restrictions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether there really is a housing shortage within New Zealand, and particularly within the Auckland property market. In pure economic terms, there can never be a shortage of any good in a free market, so long as demand and supply don&amp;rsquo;t significantly change. Under these conditions, if there are more buyers than sellers in a market then those buyers will bid the price up.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why your house isn&#39;t an asset, particularly when you begin to plan your retirement. The conclusion we come to is that the reason your house isn&#39;t an asset is that it doesn&#39;t produce any income. Sure, you can build wealth within your property, but you can never use it or unlock it unless you borrow against that wealth to pull the cash out to get started in property investment.</description>

440,000 of New Zealand&#39;s 525,000 rental properties are supplied by Mum and Dad investors (the private market). Every additional property that is supplied by private investors is another house that the government doesn&#39;t have to provide.</description>

The economy and job market is more diversified in the larger centresThe main centres tend to have higher population growth, even as a percentage. This helps to sustain housing demand, which pushes prices up.There is a larger pool of potential tenants, so you&#39;re less at risk of vacancyThere is more infrastructure being built, which opens up opportunities for capital growthBecause of these other reason the major centres tend to be more stable and predictable than the other centresTranscript </description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss Christchurch&#39;s &#39;As Is&#39; Market. The Christchurch earthquakes were devasting for homeowners in the Canterbury region. Many were left unlivable and there was a severe housing shortage in the city.&amp;nbsp;
After homeowners were paid out, and the EQC had made repairs to properties, it was clear that there were still properties that needed work. This created the &#39;As Is&#39; market.
These are properties that still require work and repairs before they can be brought up to code and to an acceptable standard.</description>

His options were to either demolish the existing property on the land and build three new units. Or, he could build a minor dwelling on the back of the property and rent it.&amp;nbsp;
He shows us why it made more sense for him to build the minor dwelling, which generated a smaller return, rather than going through a complex development process.</description>

There several reasons why someone might rent from a property investor. These include not being at the stage of life where the person is ready and able to buy their own house, not wanting to take on debt, being transient or not being able to afford to buy in the city that a person wants to live in.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041524/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss negative gearing. This is the situation where your property makes a cash loss each year after factoring in interest costs. Some property investors steer clear of negative gearing others embrace it.&amp;nbsp;
The fact is that negative gearing typically occurs when mortgage repayments are high and when investors have purchased their investment property with 100% lending. This means that no &#39;real&#39; deposit has been used to secure the property and the only cash that has been put into the property comes from the investor&#39;s &#39;top-ups&#39;.</description>

Instead of looking for factors that you would &#39;like&#39; to have as a tenant, you need to look for the factors that will make it a great investment: good capital growth with reasonable cashflow.&amp;nbsp;

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that many people will wonder why they should get into property investment now ... why not wait a few years? We discuss that so many things can change over time in property. In 5 years you may be subject to stricter lending criteria, higher market prices or increased regulation.&amp;nbsp;
You&#39;ve also got limited control about what could happen in the future, and you have no certainty about what the future might entail.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we talk about whether prospective property investors should pay off their personal (owner occupier) mortgages before investing in property –&amp;nbsp;and which they should pay off first.&amp;nbsp;
This question came from the Property Investment Chat Group NZ, a Facebook group where investors discuss property in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew walks through the reasons why it is generally better to get into investment property early rather than wait. And that it is typically better to pay off your own occupier mortgage before you pay down any investment debt.</description>

The Reserve Bank indicated that a rate cut is likely to occur in February 2020 and that the bank would still like to see increased spending from the government and businesses.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss why the NZ property market is unique. We identify that because New Zealand is a long skinny country, which was colonised, our major cities are primarily port cities –&amp;nbsp;based around large bodies of water. This is true for Auckland, Tauranga, Dunedin, Wellington, New Plymouth –&amp;nbsp;and even Christchurch.
This means that there is an area the city can&#39;t expand into. This means that inner-city land becomes more desirable because the new suburbs are further and further away (compared to if the city could expand in a perfect circle.</description>

His challenge to them was to sacrifice now and invest ... or continue to live their current lifestyle and sacrifice later in retirement.&amp;nbsp;

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss how property cycles tend to work, with a special mention on the Auckland Property Market. Property cycles are arguably one of the most important considerations when investing in property. However, they are very hard/impossible to predict.&amp;nbsp;
One of the key takeaways from the show is that the property cycle is not the same as the economic cycle. Where shares tend to fluctuate widely in value based on the economic cycle, this is not the same for property.</description>

2 of the investors within these case studies achieved large gains in the value of their properties within the first 4-6 years of owning their investments. 1 of them is yet to see any substantial gain from their investment.
We talk through some of the reasons why this might happen, and how property cycles impact the immediate gains that can be achieved by investors.</description>

Mangere is one of Auckland&#39;s lower socio-economic areas, and may not typically have been where most investors would have thought to buy a property. However, there are a lot of good reasons to invest in properties that are located within the suburb.&amp;nbsp;
Over the last 18.5 years, Mangere properties have appreciated at a rate of 8.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss the nitty-gritty of what property managers really do for property investors. Over a 10 year period, you are likely to pay your property manager the same amount of cash as you will your real estate agent. However, for that, you will get significantly more value and service.&amp;nbsp;
Celia estimates that over recent years the workload for a property manager has increased by 30%, however, they haven&#39;t increased their fees.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what a good rental yield is for Auckland property investors. Nationally, we know that Auckland typically will deliver higher capital growth but lower yields.&amp;nbsp;
This depends on the type of property you have in Auckland, its location and then purchase price.&amp;nbsp;
While the national median yield is over 4%, in Auckland, we would typically think someone hitting 4% would be doing well.
We are once again joined by Celia Burbery, general manager of Auckland Property Management.</description>

A big part of being able to do that is managing the property itself. That&#39;s where property managers come in.
Recently there have been a few law changes and judicial rulings that impact property investors.</description>

These include all the utilities you need to cover e.g. water, power, internet. You&#39;d also expect to pay for consumables like salt and pepper, shampoo, milk (all the creature comforts guests expect).
Property management is also more hands-on, which leads to higher costs. Management fees are also higher. Long term rental management fees are 7-10% of gross yield.</description>

If you know what guests are looking for, you can give it to them, and better market your property.&amp;nbsp;

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041541/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one simple strategy you can use to double your price on Airbnb –&amp;nbsp;dynamic pricing. This is where you vary the price of your property based on what is happening in the market. When there is a lot of demand in the market for flights or hotel rooms, hotels and airlines will put their prices up.&amp;nbsp;
Jon shares that software is now available that allows Airbnb hosts to do the same thing.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Jon Lawry from Urban Butler to discuss using Airbnb with property investment. This episode specifically covers the yield you can expect from an Airbnb.
Typically you can expect at least a 50% higher net yield from an Airbnb compared to a standard long term tenancy. It is, however, important to note that to generate these types of yields you need a property that will appeal to people who use Airbnb (apartments near the centre of town).</description>

This includes the reports you need to get, the clauses that need to be negotiated, the back and forth that occurs when negotiating the price, and picking up the keys.&amp;nbsp;
There are over 150 different steps that make up the property buying process, and the trick is to know what&#39;s coming so you can prepare.</description>

This content comes from an article that Andrew recently wrote for Juno Investment magazine, which will be released as part of the next issue.&amp;nbsp;
After sharing the three thresholds, Andrew then shows how you can break the rules and invest anyway.&amp;nbsp;
These three thresholds are:

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we look at whether new builds, or existing renovation projects give the highest return on the capital you have invested. This episode is based on an article that Andrew recently wrote for the NZ Property Investor Magazine.&amp;nbsp;
In the article, Andrew compares a $500,000 new build, with an existing property purchased for $400K and then renovated for $50K (resulting in a renovated property with a $500K valuation).</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041547/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a recent idea that has been suggested by the Interim Retirement Commissioner –&amp;nbsp;should you be able to use your KiwiSaver to buy your first investment property (if you don&#39;t already own another property).
This is an important topic because we know that some groups in NZ are finding it hard to get onto the property ladder –&amp;nbsp;and yet the NZ superannuation was never meant to support accommodation costs, it was always assumed that these would be sorted.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode – our last with Clara Kim from the Juno KiwiSaver Scheme – we discuss how to withdraw your KiwiSaver from your provider. This is very simple but slightly different based on the reason for your withdrawal (whether for your first home or for retirement).&amp;nbsp;
The other way you are able to withdraw your KiwiSaver is through an application for financial hardship. This is significantly more difficult and complex, which is the reason it was not discussed.</description>

These include Conservative, Balanced and Growth funds. We detail the different asset classes that each of these would typically hold, as well as the growth rates we&#39;d expect each fund to have, before going into the final returns we&#39;d expect an investor to generate over 35 years (starting at age 30, and retiring at 65).</description>

The purpose of the campaign is to bring New Zealander&#39;s attention to the size of the fees charged by some KiwiSaver providers. We discuss the different models KiwiSaver providers use to charge fees, and the impacts that has on your potential returns.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we give an update on the NZ property market based on the REINZ monthly update. Median house prices are up 6.6% on the last year, but there is significant variation around the country. Manawatu-Wanganui us up 24.1%, but Auckland is only up 0.2% and the West Coast is down 7.5%.
We also go into depth about how median house prices are calculated and what they mean (and what they don&#39;t mean).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are again joined by Dean Blair from FoxPlan and we talk about why your spending won&#39;t go down in Retirement. When speaking with people nearing retirement, part of their plan is often to reduce their spending –&amp;nbsp;perhaps often to spend half as much as they currently do.&amp;nbsp;
The issue is that we spend more during the weekends and when we are on vacation. Retirement is the longest vacation of your life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss the Queenstown Property Market.&amp;nbsp;
Queenstown has a unique property market due to the impact of tourism and its landscape. The lake and high mountains reduce the amount of land available for housing in central Queenstown, and hotels with big pockets crowd out some land that could otherwise be used for housing.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss whether you can get an interest-only loan forever.
The general rule of thumb is that an interest-only loan period will run for 5 years. At the end of those 5-years you can apply for another 5-year period.&amp;nbsp;
However, the bank will always consider whether you can afford the higher principal and interest payments once the interest-only period has finished.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are once again joined by Josh Graham from Roost Mortgages. And we discuss that even if you think you can afford a mortgage at the current interest rates, the banks may not approve your application.&amp;nbsp;
The reason is that banks have higher servicing &#39;tests&#39; that they run your mortgage application through. This means that even if you go on a 3.65% interest-only loan, they will test you on principal and interest at 6.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we are joined by Josh Graham from Roost mortgages. In the show, we answer the questions we received from the audience at our recent Queenstown property investment seminar.
Here, we discuss whether it is cheaper to use a floating interest rate, rather than a fixed interest rate. The short answer is no. However, there may be a reason that some property investors or first home buyers might use a floating interest rate for a portion of their loan.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, Dean Blair and Ed discuss who&#39;s best interests your advisor really has in mind. Traditionally, investment companies attract customers based on free advice. Advisors would then earn their income from receiving a commission if their clients purchased a specific product.&amp;nbsp;
Dean explains why this has meant that even well-meaning advisors will be seated on the opposite side of the table to the client, representing the best interests of their company and products.</description>

We agree that while it&#39;s never too late to get it sorted, the plans and tactics you use will be different based on your age and situation.&amp;nbsp;
The key part of any retirement plan is understanding the risks you are taking and clearly seeing your options.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss another question posed by our youngest listener – Jackson ... &#34;when you die, will I get some of the properties?&#34; This is an important question because one of the key reasons people get started in property investment is to build inter-generational wealth ... and leave an enduring legacy for their children.&amp;nbsp;
We discuss the need to set up wills, enduring power of attorneys, and the need to have proper insurance and risk mitigation programmes in place.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what to look out for in a rental property. And it starts with understanding the type of investor that you are first –&amp;nbsp;whether you are looking for capital growth or whether you are looking for yield.&amp;nbsp;
If you&#39;re looking for yield, you&#39;ll realise that there are different tenancies that you could go for, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. We discuss room by room tenancies and Air BNB.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss maintenance. One of the biggest complaints landlords receive from tenants is deferred maintenance. That&#39;s where tenants have reported maintenance issues and they haven&#39;t been actioned by the landlord.&amp;nbsp;
The issue with maintenance is that it is hard to plan for. You don&#39;t know when things are going to break, what&#39;s going to break and how much it&#39;s going to cost. The only way to combat this is to budget and plan for it accordingly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss what do you do if you don&#39;t like your tenants. And we move on to speak broadly about tenancy law in property investment. This episode was inspired by one of our youngest listeners, 7 year-old Jackson, who asked his Mum what to do in this situation.&amp;nbsp;
We cover the idea that your relationship with your tenant (as a landlord) is not a personal relationship, it is a business relationship, so it doesn&#39;t really matter whether you like them or not.</description>

        <title>Vacancy – Fears That Stop People Investing | Ep. 25 | The Property Academy Podcast</title>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041569/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss one of the key fears that stops people from investing in property – vacancy i.e. the fear of not having a tenant. This is a fear we often see. If a landlord doesn&#39;t have a tenant then they need to cover the costs of owning an investment property entirely by themselves –&amp;nbsp;the mortgage, rates, property management, insurance and maintenance. This would be crippling for many prospective Mum and Dad investors.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss whether you should get your investment ideas and strategies for where tho invest from the headlines.&amp;nbsp;
We talk through the fact that by the time the newspapers are writing stories about high growth areas, it is often too late. And we discuss that for Buy and Hold investors, it is more important to look at a market&#39;s fundamentals rather than following the quicks wins that are often depicted in the media.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041571/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss that there are only 2 core property investment strategies: Buy and Hold, and Flipping. Most other strategies people use are variations of the two.
Buy and Hold investing is the &#39;get rich slow&#39; strategy, where you buy an investment that you forecast will increase in value over time. Flipping is where you buy a property that is a bit &#39;run down&#39; and then renovate it to increase its value.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss a study that was conducted by the Commission for Financial Capability as part of Sortd Money Week in September 2019. The study showed that parents would rather talk with their kids about sex and drugs, rather than money.&amp;nbsp;
Parents would rather cover drugs (26%) and alcohol (27%) than tell their children how much they earned (14%) or talk about the risks of personal loans (12%).</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we question whether the suburb of Rolleston makes a good investment option. Rolleston is the largest town in the Selwyn District and is a 30-minute drive to Christchurch.
Rolleston was dubbed the &#34;city of the future&#34; for many years. It seems as if it is coming true. The town has had 12% annual population growth over the last 15 years, which is projected to continue.&amp;nbsp;</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this episode, we discuss 2 potential strategies you can use to pay off your mortgage faster, using investment property.&amp;nbsp;
Both strategies involve leveraging your existing home to purchase an investment property. In essence, this means using the house to pay for itself.
In the first strategy, you purchase a capital growth property, which will go up in value quickly, though will also require a cash top-up each week.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #16, we discuss whether it is the right financial decision to purchase the street that is just down the road from you.&amp;nbsp; We touch on why it may be better to diversify your risk across multiple areas of a city – or across several cities.&amp;nbsp;
This means that all your eggs aren&#39;t in one basket.&amp;nbsp; We also touch on the fact that it is often better for your investment to be out of sight and out of mind so that it doesn&#39;t stress you out.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #15, we discuss AirBnbs, and the benefits and drawbacks of using your investment property for Airbnb only, rather than tenanting the property.
Andrew specifically walks through an example of the &#34;sleep test&#34; where, if you are struggling to get to sleep because you&#39;re worried about whether there will be bookings, then Airbnb is probably not a good option for you.&amp;nbsp;
We also discuss that while Airbnb can produce better cashflow returns than a standard tenant, it does come with higher costs and more uncertainty, which some investors may not be willing to accept.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041580/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #14, we discuss whether property investors are &#34;greedy psychopaths&#34;. Ed recently had an article published in Stuff, New Zealand&#39;s largest news website. One commenter wrote, &#34;property investment (speculation really) is a cancer on society by greedy psychopaths.&#34;
We touch on that without property investors, many New Zealanders wouldn&#39;t have a place to live, since investors provide accommodation to renters.
Far from being greedy, we discuss how many property investors are using investment property to save for their retirement.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode 13, we discuss Ring Fencing. This is a new piece of legislation that stops New Zealand property investors from claiming tax benefits they were previously entitled to.&amp;nbsp;
Under the previous regime, if a property investor made a tax loss each year, the investor could subtract the loss from their income tax. &amp;nbsp;This meant that they could claim a tax refund on the additional tax they had already paid.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode 12, we discuss split banking. Split banking is the process of using multiple banks, rather than just a single bank.&amp;nbsp;
Split banking means that you can protect your assets, control the proceeds of any sales you make, and potentially borrow more. This means you can grow your wealth and your portfolio faster.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew also shares a story of clients who didn&#39;t use split banking and got stung because of it.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041583/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Episode 11, we discuss KPMG&#39;s Magnet City report. Written in 2015, the global report introduces the concept of the Magnet City, a city that is expected to attract population growth of a particular type of people – young wealth creators.
Young wealth creators are those who will start businesses and create jobs, which improves the economy of a region.
This is important for property investors because magnet cities will make good property markets – they have growing populations of young people with higher than average incomes.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041584/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Episode 10, we discuss why you shouldn&#39;t be afraid of investing in a flat property market, where prices aren&#39;t increasing.&amp;nbsp;
Andrew quotes Warren Buffet: &#34;be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.&#34; And we talk through that investing in a market when prices are already going up means that another property owner receives the gains you might have achieved.
Although we&#39;re not suggesting you should invest in every and any flat market, we are suggesting that you shouldn&#39;t be automatically fearful.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode 9, we discuss all the reasons why you would – and should – use a mortgage broker. That&#39;s whether you&#39;re a first home buyer or a property investor.&amp;nbsp;You may look around on the internet and look for a mortgage calculator, and then think you don&#39;t need a mortgage broker. However, mortgage brokers do more than just calculate your mortgage.
Mortgage brokers are your representative to the banks, and will go on your behalf to negotiate with multiple banks for you.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041587/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #7, we discuss the difference between equity and useable equity + how that impacts your ability to become a property investor.&amp;nbsp;
Most people become first-time property investors by leveraging their own homes to secure the deposit for their investment.&amp;nbsp;
In the episode, we discuss the way to do this: 1) take out a separate loan against your own home, 2) use the money from that &amp;nbsp;loan as a cash deposit to secure a secondary loan from another bank, 3) use the two loans together to fund the full purchase price of the property.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #6, we discuss the differences between investing in brand new properties or properties that have already been lived in before (existing properties).&amp;nbsp;
We specifically discuss the differences in what banks will lend you towards each type of property and the level of deposit you need for each.&amp;nbsp;
We also discuss the differences in tenants you might get, and why the decision actually depends on the investment property strategy you want to run with.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #5, we talk about how much you need to get started in property investment (and first homes).
This topic came from an audience member who was on our website and specifically asked how much they need to get started.
We&#39;ve previously talked about the percentage amounts that people need to get started, but here we start to talk about the actual dollar amounts required.
In the episode, we recommended looking at median house prices in your region to get a feel for what the average property costs.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #4, we talk about the Labour government&#39;s recent KiwiBuild Reset and what this means for First Home Buyers.&amp;nbsp;
We talk about the Welcome Home Loans, where First Home Buyers now only need a 5% deposit to purchase a house (terms and conditions apply).
We go through what those terms and conditions are, and touch on why property is more affordable now than it was a few years ago .</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #3, we talk about the returns you can expect to get from property and real estate investing. We also compare these returns to other types of investments.
We talk about the concept of leverage. We touch on how you can use the bank&#39;s money to purchase a property ... and then keep all the profits as the house increases in value.
We then speak about why property is one of the only asset classes where you can get &#39;2 bites of the cherry.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/2621041592/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #2, we talk about the retirement gap, which is the significant gap between what Kiwis want to live on in retirement, and what they&#39;re actually on track to have.
The World Economic Forum, recently said that ageing populations and lack of savings are &#34;the financial equivalent of climate change&#34;.&amp;nbsp;
We also cover why the retirement gap exists, how New Zealand&#39;s population is changing, and why many people in most rich countries will outlive their money by more than a decade.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Episode #1, we talk about why we&#39;re starting a podcast. And&amp;nbsp;that reason is that Kiwis love talking about property, they love thinking about the property market. But, they don&#39;t necessarily know how to get the most out of it.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s shown by the number of pre-approvals for mortgages that New Zealanders get from mortgage brokers ... that don&#39;t end up getting used. That means that as a country, we&#39;re going out and saying we want to do something, but not always following through.</description>
