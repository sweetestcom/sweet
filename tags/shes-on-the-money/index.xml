        <description>Podcast Description Today we&#39;re talking about the 5 ETF&#39;s that returned the most in 2021, because 2022 is the year we are going to become fluent in the language of investment together! Now before you dive right in, it’s VERY important to note that any episode we do on investment is NOT advice, but rather an open-ended conversation. Just because we discuss a particular product and its performance or underlying assets, does not mean we recommend it - you’d need personal advice for that - the purpose is for you to be even more educated, so you can have more informed conversations and make more informed decisions more often.</description>
