Musk has said that he’s politically a centrist, but the tweet is just one recent example of how he’s adopted partisan language in a social media culture war.

We&amp;rsquo;ve covered the controversy surrounding soccer&amp;rsquo;s biggest tournament — from human rights abuses to allegations of bribery, and corruption at FIFA.

On March 17, 2023, Canadians with a mental illness as their sole condition will be eligible.
This evolution is controversial. The change also has some doctors who have been at the forefront of helping people die medically, called MAID providers, feeling increasingly uncomfortable.
Dr. Madeline Li is one of them. She is a psychiatrist and a MAID provider who developed the MAID framework for the University Health Network in Toronto.</description></item><item><title>The impact of 8 billion people on the planet | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040298/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040298/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Tuesday, the human population reached eight billion people, according to an estimate by the United Nations. While population growth has slowed in recent years, it still took about a decade to add the last billion people.
Meanwhile, humankind is continuing to do irreparable harm to the planet, including climate change, accelerated species extinction and ecosystem collapse. We’re also straining the planet’s ability to sustain this many people, as revealed by water scarcity for billions of people — all while people in more affluent countries are responsible for far more than their fair share of the harm.</description></item><item><title>The collapse of the ‘Crypto King’ | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040299/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040299/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the last two years, cryptocurrency exchange FTX spent millions of dollars on advertisements with the likes of NFL quarterback Tom Brady and Curb Your Enthusiasm’s Larry David.

Inflation is high, approval ratings for U.S. President Joe Biden are low, and traditionally, the sitting president’s party loses seats in the midterms. So, it seemed like Republicans would clean up, and pundits and politicians predicted the electoral map would reflect a red wave.
But the Democrats performed better than expected, and the wave didn’t materialize.</description></item><item><title>Qatar and a World Cup controversy | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040302/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040302/</guid><description>Podcast Description This month&amp;rsquo;s FIFA World Cup is a big one for Canada. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time in 36 years that our men&amp;rsquo;s team has qualified to compete, and the last World Cup before Canada shares hosting duties in 2026.
But in the decade since Qatar won its bid to host this year&amp;rsquo;s tournament, allegations of bribery, discrimination and human rights abuses have threatened to overshadow the game. Qatar criminalizes same-sex relationships and a report from the Guardian says at least 6,500 migrant workers have died since its successful bid.</description></item><item><title>Why can Canadian premiers suspend your rights? | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040303/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040303/</guid><description>Podcast Description In Canada, if a government really wants to, it can take away many of the rights guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. If a provincial government is willing to risk the potential blowback, it can use Section 33 of the charter, the notwithstanding clause, which allows a government to temporarily override some of its protections and freedoms. And while once quite taboo, the notwithstanding clause is being increasingly, and controversially, used as a legislative tool by provinces like Ontario and Quebec.</description></item><item><title>What’s sending more kids to the hospital? | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040304/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040304/</guid><description>Podcast Description This fall, most Canadian kids returned to school and daycare with few or no COVID-19 measures.
Beyond the coronavirus itself, that&amp;rsquo;s meant all sorts of other viruses have started circulating more widely among children — which is, in some ways, a return to normal.
But some are spreading earlier in the season than usual, and hospitals across Canada are reporting a surge in child admissions.

As the COP27 climate summit kicks into gear, we&amp;rsquo;re speaking to Wallace-Wells about both — and we&amp;rsquo;re going to start by talking about the good news.

Experts say that what the Ontario government chooses to do here — and how the public responds — could have ripple effects for labour disputes, and the right to strike, across the country.
That’s because the Ford government introduced legislation this week that would prevent these workers from striking before they even start, and do it using the highly controversial notwithstanding clause, which allows provinces to temporarily override some parts of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</description></item><item><title>How the midterms could shape U.S. politics for years | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040308/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040308/</guid><description>Podcast Description On Tuesday, the U.S. holds its midterm elections.

At the same time, nearly five million Haitians are facing acute hunger.
Gangs have seized the majority of Haiti’s capital, a critical fuel terminal, and the nation’s politics remain unstable after the assassination of the president in July last year.
It’s these compounding crises that have led the unpopular current government to call for international intervention from the US, Canada and the UN – a controversial move in a country with a long history of foreign meddling.</description></item><item><title>The problem of unelected leaders | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040313/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040313/</guid><description>Podcast Description Conservative Rishi Sunak has just become the third leader of the U.K. in two months, and he&amp;rsquo;s got a mandate to rule until 2025.

From the ages of 12 to 15, the teen was relentlessly harassed and exploited online by more than 20 social media accounts that extorted her for sexual images.
On Saturday, nearly 10 years after her death, a 44-year-old Dutch national, Aydin Coban, was convicted of extortion, possession of child pornography, child luring and criminal harassment against Todd.</description></item><item><title>The unexpected rise of Quebec’s Conservative party | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040370/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040370/</guid><description>Podcast Description Quebec&amp;rsquo;s Conservative party — unaffiliated with the federal Conservatives — had long been essentially a fringe party in the province, with no seats in the legislature, no invitations to major debates and little funding.
But since former talk radio host Éric Duhaime took over last year, the party has become a contender in Quebec politics, at some points polling as high as nearly 20 per cent.
A recent CBC News investigation found that of the first 54 candidates the party has announced, nearly 30 per cent have used their social media accounts during the pandemic to amplify medical misinformation, conspiracy theorists or to engage with far-right extremists.</description></item><item><title>The chaotic trial of InfoWars’ Alex Jones | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040371/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040371/</guid><description>Podcast Description For many years, far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has touted that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a fake.

The internal data on use of force and strip searches from 2020 also showed Indigenous people were, proportionally, more likely than any other racial group to be strip-searched after being arrested.
Some academics, journalists and activists have been saying for decades that systemic racism is a problem in policing.</description></item><item><title>Did Google make conscious AI? | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040408/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040408/</guid><description>Podcast Description Earlier this week, Blake Lemoine, an engineer who works for Google’s Responsible AI department, went public with his belief that Google’s LaMDA chatbot is sentient.
LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, is an artificial intelligence program that mimics speech and tries to predict which words are most related to the prompts it is given.
While some experts believe that conscious AI is something that will be possible in the future, many in the field think that Lemoine is mistaken — and that the conversation he has stirred up about sentience takes away from the immediate and pressing ethical questions surrounding Google’s control over this technology and the ease at which people can be fooled by it.</description></item><item><title>Jacob Hoggard and consent in Canada | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040409/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040409/</guid><description>Podcast Description On June 5, after six days of deliberation, a jury found former Hedley frontman Jacob Hoggard guilty of sexually assaulting an Ottawa woman.
The jury also acquitted Hoggard of sexually assaulting a fan who was 16 years old during a separate encounter, and of a sexual interference charge related to accusations he touched her when she was still 15.

Some of the issues include hours-long security lineups, delayed or cancelled flights, passengers stuck on the tarmac and major congestion at border security.
Many say most of the blame falls on two short-staffed government security entities, but some have also pointed fingers at COVID-19 testing rules, airlines and even out-of-practice travellers.</description></item><item><title>Front Burner Introduces: The Village Season Three - The Montreal Murders | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040412/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 06:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040412/</guid><description>Podcast Description In the early 1990s, as AIDS tightens its grip on major cities around the world, the relative safety of Montreal’s nightlife becomes a magnet for gay men. But when they start turning up dead in hotel rooms, beaten lifeless in city parks, and violently murdered in their own homes, the queer community has more to fear than the disease. While the city’s police force dithers over the presence of a serial killer, a group of queer activists starts making connections, and rises up to start a movement that would end up changing thousands of lives.</description></item><item><title>Solving the mysteries of long COVID | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040413/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040413/</guid><description>Podcast Description Shortness of breath, fatigue and brain fog.

More than 40 per cent of his own MPs voted against him. This, after a damning report from senior civil servant Sue Gray, which added to a long list of revelations about the so-called ‘partygate’ scandal.

But since the start of the pandemic, the forum has become a huge concern for many people on the right, including those who view the WEF as shadowy puppet masters at the centre of a complex web of conspiracy theories.

But there has been a fierce backlash against it from some Indigenous communities, advocates for immigrants and refugees, business owners, and experts who say it infringes on an array of human and legal rights.
Some analysts have criticized the Quebec government for invoking the notwithstanding clause, which allows provinces to override Canada&amp;rsquo;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to pass the bill.</description></item><item><title>Collecting evidence of war crimes in Ukraine | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040421/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040421/</guid><description>Podcast Description An enormous effort is underway to gather evidence of alleged war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine.

Prices at gas stations rose above $2 a litre in many parts of the country, while the cost of pasta is up 20 per cent at grocery stores. Canada’s official inflation rate hit a three-decade high in April, rising at a 6.8 per cent annual pace.
But what’s behind these sticker-shocking prices can’t be explained by any one factor; the ongoing war in Ukraine, climate change and even some unprecedented monetary policy all contribute to the current situation.</description></item><item><title>Texas, guns and America’s political paralysis | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040423/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040423/</guid><description>Podcast Description The gun debate in America is cycling through its usual motions in the wake of mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Uvalde, Texas.

Given that COVID-19 is still a part of our day-to-day lives, the threat of another infectious disease spreading at a rapid rate feels unsettling at best.

Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, has proposed a ban on Muslim women wearing headscarves in public, and she&amp;rsquo;s in striking distance of upsetting Emmanuel Macron, France&amp;rsquo;s current centrist president.

A month after those blockades were finally dismantled, CBC reporter Joel Dryden travelled to Coutts to look at the lasting rifts the protests created among residents — and why, even with most mandates now lifted across Canada, some protesters are staying put.</description></item><item><title>Bonus | Nothing is Foreign: South Korea’s ‘K-Trump’ gives voice to growing anti-feminist movement | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040479/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040479/</guid><description>Podcast Description South’s Korea incoming president, Yoon Suk Yeol, demonizes feminism, blames women for the country’s low birth rate and denies the existence of gender inequality. His campaign — which capitalized on the politics of grievance — has drawn comparisons to former U.S. president Donald Trump. So much so that he is also known as K-Trump.

Last week, Canada announced it was freezing assets and banning business from Russian figures including Roman Abramovich, who has been ordered to sell his Chelsea Football Club in the United Kingdom. The U.K. and European Union have taken similar measures against Abramovich and others, and the U.S. has convened a multilateral task force dedicated to sanctioning these elites.</description></item><item><title>The fight for ‘climate change reparations’ | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040481/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040481/</guid><description>Podcast Description The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is scathing: it lays out the stark divide between rich and poor nations’ ability to withstand global warming’s worst effects.

So for weeks, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been making a desperate plea to the United States and its NATO allies to impose a “no-fly zone” over the country — to keep Russian warplanes out of the sky. But a no-fly zone hinges on the notion that if a Russian plane violates the terms, it will be shot down. And the idea of entering into armed combat with a nuclear power is a clear and potentially catastrophic risk for Western leaders.</description></item><item><title>Canada’s rental crisis | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040484/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040484/</guid><description>Podcast Description Rents in Canada are skyrocketing, and tenants are struggling to keep up.

The United States and the United Kingdom moved to ban Russian oil imports. Even the European Union, Russia’s biggest oil customer, announced its plan to slash Russian oil imports by two-thirds this year.
Although Canada has never really relied on Russian oil, the impact of sky-high oil prices is already being felt in Canada, as prices at the pumps remain at record highs across the country.</description></item><item><title>How Putin is weaponizing Ukraine's far-right fringe | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040487/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040487/</guid><description>Podcast Description As he declared his war on Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin made an odd promise to a country with a Jewish president and an annual Pride parade: He said he was doing this to &amp;ldquo;de-Nazify&amp;rdquo; the country.

The scene captured in a video Sunday shows a mortar shell falling in the street, killing three family members and a family friend — including two children.

In a nearly hour-long address, Putin claimed that modern Ukraine was an invention of founding Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, and that Soviet Moscow gave Ukraine its independence in a historic mistake.

The federal Liberals invoked the act last Monday, granting temporary powers to the government to handle ongoing blockades and protests against pandemic restrictions, including clearing protesters and freezing associated bank accounts. The Liberals say it was a necessary move to end illegal protests; some opponents, meanwhile, argue it was an overreach that sets a dangerous precedent for cracking down on future protests.</description></item><item><title>Front Burner Introduces: Welcome to Paradise | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040503/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 08:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040503/</guid><description>Podcast Description Anna Maria Tremonti has been keeping her past a secret for over 40 years.

He ultimately killed 22 people.
One survivor of the rampage was Lisa Banfield, the killer’s common-law spouse, who — along with her brother and brother-in-law — has since been criminally charged with supplying the shooter with ammunition.</description></item><item><title>Taking the public temperature on COVID-19 | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040507/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040507/</guid><description>Podcast Description Nearly two full years have passed since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Since then, COVID-19, deteriorating relations with the West, allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and a resulting diplomatic boycott put a damper on the Games.
Yet China plowed forward, promising to put on a spectacular show while keeping out COVID-19, through the use of tight, non-negotiable safety measures.
Today, we’re talking to The National’s Adrienne Arsenault from inside the rigid operation created to keep Beijing’s 21 million residents safe from COVID-19 — and to keep the world’s athletes, journalists and Winter Olympics&amp;rsquo; staff fenced in.</description></item><item><title>A patent-free vaccine for the world | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040518/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040518/</guid><description>Podcast Description Texas-based scientists Maria Elena Bottazzi and Peter Hotez won&amp;rsquo;t make a cent off the vaccine they developed — and they don&amp;rsquo;t want to.

And that led to kids being taken from their communities at higher rates, often for problems that could have been solved with better supports.
This week, after years of court battles, the federal government made a $40 billion promise to First Nations leaders. $20 billion of that will go to compensate kids who were unnecessarily removed from their homes on reserve or in the Yukon.</description></item><item><title>Dozens die in custody after public intoxication arrests | Front Burner</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/8028040537/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/8028040537/</guid><description>Podcast Description “Alcoholism is an illness, it’s not a crime and it certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be punishable by death.” That’s a message from Jeannette Rogers, whose son, Corey, died in police custody in Halifax in 2016.
