        <description>Podcast Description I&#39;m sorry, but if you listened to this programme for any period of time the headline you saw in the NZ Herald would make you scratch your head.
The headline read &#34;shock as GDP falls 0.3%&#34;.
What shock? Just yesterday we had Westpac who saw a fall of 0.1%, we have said consistently this country is in recession, and by that I mean the Q3 number confirmed yesterday and the state we are currently in, in Q4.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Talks of impeachment against President Biden are being written off as a politically motivated attack. The Republican majority House of Representatives voted this week to formally authorise its ongoing impeachment inquiry. So far, House Republicans have produced no evidence of Biden&#39;s wrongdoing. US Correspondent Richard Arnold told Mike Hosking that they might have ulterior motives. He suggests the Republicans want an even playing field for next year&#39;s election, with a twice impeached Donald Trump running for re-election.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Organisers of the FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup are thrilled with the legacy left by the event. Auckland played a major role in the tournament by hosting nine matches. Over $87 million in GDP was injected into the region&#39;s economy, surpassing the initial projection by just under 50%. MBIE NZ Major Events Manager Kylie Hawker-Green told Mike Hosking that the event exceeded expectations. She says the tournament boosted the economy in the quieter months of July and August.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Finance Minister says they&#39;ve inherited a toxic trifecta of high inflation, high interest rates, and recession. GDP fell 0.3% in the three months to September, a much worse result than economists had predicted. The June quarter&#39;s figures showed 0.5% growth, revised from 0.9%. Nicola Willis told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s bad, but claims her government can clean it up. LISTEN ABOVE See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.

        <description>Podcast Description The Motor Industry Association&#39;s concerned for the future of electric vehicles in New Zealand. Parliament&#39;s repealed the Clean Car Discount —dubbed a &#39;ute tax&#39; by its opponents— under urgency, following a third reading. The policy subsidised the purchases of electric vehicles by charging a tax on purchases of polluting vehicles. CEO Aimee Wiley told Mike Hosking that while it&#39;s great to have clarity from the Government, it&#39;s a shame the rebates are ending.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An economist says we&#39;re in an economy that&#39;s significantly smaller than estimated. GDP fell 0.3% in the three months to September. The June quarter&#39;s figures showed 0.5% growth, revised from 0.9%. NZ Initiative director Oliver Hartwich told Mike Hosking that it means we&#39;re in a technical recession, but the revision&#39;s more shocking. He says all together, the effect was the economy is now 1.8% of GDP smaller than the Reserve Bank last thought when they set the Official Cash Rate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description New Zealanders drinking behaviour may be improving, according to new data. This year&#39;s Health Survey shows a record low 16% of the adult population reporting hazardous drinking, an almost 3% drop on the year before. NZ Alcohol Beverages Council Executive Director Virginia Nicholls told Mike Hosking that positive community support and education have definitely played a role. She says she thinks there&#39;s been a positive cultural change happening for at least the past 20 years.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Is it just me or are the growing number of reports about the ineptitude of the last Government an ever-larger indictment on what might be the most useless collection of buffoons in the modern political age? I mean we all knew they were trouble, hence the election result, and as I mentioned at the start of the show no one held them to more account than this programme. But then there&#39;s this new report from the Auditor-General John Ryan on the shovel ready projects.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government&#39;s sunk plans for the Cook Strait ferry upgrade, pulling the plug on contracts already underway. KiwiRail&#39;s plans to fix the infrastructure got too expensive according to Finance Minister Nicola Willis, who announced they won&#39;t be going ahead with the plans. KiwiRail Chief Executive, Peter Reidy, told Mike Hosking that they now need to come together to find a way forward. He says they respect the Government&#39;s decision but would like to sit down with them to secure a resolution for the infrastructure.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Commuting to and from New Zealand&#39;s busiest airport is changing with a new Transport Hub opening up next year. Over the past 12 months, the old carpark outside Auckland Airport&#39;s international terminal has been replaced, and a $300 million transport centre has taken form. Chief Executive Carrie Hurihanganui told Mike Hosking that they&#39;ve tried to create a seamless commuting process for people. She says they thought about how they could make it as easy as possible for public transport, taxis, and private vehicle owners.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Purchasing Christmas lunch will be more expensive than last year despite falling food prices. For a third month in a row, food prices have continued to fall, but they&#39;re still 6% higher than a year ago. Grocery food&#39;s 7% increase was one of the largest contributors to the annual change. Foodstuffs managing director Chris Quin told Mike Hosking that he expects most shoppers will have to stick to a budget this Christmas.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There&#39;s less optimism for today&#39;s GDP figure than there was for the last. Stats NZ will release the September quarter figure later this morning. In June, Gross Domestic Product rose 0.9%. Westpac Senior Economist, Darren Gibbs, told Mike Hosking that they&#39;re predicting a 0.1% decrease to our economy. He says the manufacturing sector&#39;s seen weak growth, which is a strong economic indicator. Gibbs believes the sector will be a drag on our GDP figure, as manufacturing&#39;s PMI figure has been at dreadful levels recently.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270016/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Two of the former Government&#39;s massive infrastructure programmes were rushed against the advice of officials, leading to costly blowouts. Auditor-General John Ryan&#39;s released a report on the $15 billion NZ Upgrade Programme and Shovel-Ready Projects. He found ministers received ample warning from officials that some projects would struggle to be delivered on time and on budget. Bookkeeping was so poor in some cases it&#39;s difficult to determine all the initiatives that received funding.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Requests for restructuring and redundancy support is up nearly 50% as the slowing economy starts to bite. The Employers and Manufacturers Association says requests have been steadily increasing over the past year, but there&#39;s been a surge in the past four months. Businesses across the board, but particularly in the manufacturing, retail, and hospitality industries, are suffering the most.

        <description>Podcast Description I am wondering if the Tauranga-based group that have filed for an urgent Waitangi Tribunal hearing are the same, or an associated group who have busied themselves causing grief to the Tauranga port, who want to expand their operations because they need to grow and employ more people and return more dividends to the local economy. There must be something waring about being so negative, or destructive, or activist.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Questions are being raised over how to tweak immigration policies to get the right net migration levels. Stats NZ data is showing a record high net migration gain of 128,900 migrants in the year to October. Infometrics Chief Economist Brad Olsen told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s difficult to get it right, especially with a near two-year lag between policies and arrivals. He says often ministers go too far the other way when they make changes, and two years later neither matches up.</description>

Its 27 recommendations include supporting swapping from fossil fuels to renewable energy, encouraging switching to electric vehicles, and retrofitting buildings to be healthier and lower emissions. Commission Chair Rod Carr told Mike Hosking that the Government&#39;s committed to New Zealand&#39;s climate targets and has been clear it&#39;ll make different policy choices. He says the Commission&#39;s providing advice on the direction of policy, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s the elected leaders who will make the choices.</description>

As the new Government makes its expectations for Police clear, the performance of Commissioner Andrew Coster has come into question - with the Police Association describing him as “the man that’s there”. Last night, National’s new Police Minister Mark Mitchell publicly released a letter of expectations he had agreed to with Coster. The letter sets out National’s key policies, including those in its first 100 days plan, including gang patch bans and law changes to give police more search powers and stop gang members associating with each other.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Drought and war plaguing the world&#39;s main maritime trade routes is disrupting the global supply chain. A severe drought around the Panama Canal since June has had ships reroute to the Suez Canal, where congestion is building. Combined with attacks in the Red Sea area over the weekend, higher costs and delays are likely on the horizon. Custom Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation chief executive, Sherelle Kennelly told Mike Hosking that the impact this will have on New Zealanders has yet to be determined.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Mark Mitchell says he has confidence in Police Commissioner Andrew Coster and is looking forward to working with him. The new Police Minister has made public a letter he wrote to Coster outlining his focuses. Mitchell says he&#39;s keen to put Coster&#39;s approach under Labour in the past. He told Mike Hosking that much of what he criticised him for was actually because of who was in Government. Mitchell says it was Labour&#39;s responsibility for policy Mitchell was against, like reducing prison populations and removing three strikes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The investigation is underway as to how Treasury advice was leaked around the Fair Pay Agreements. One headline suggested the Government were shaken by it. I wonder if that is slightly overstating the case, but you would at least be surprised that something like this happened so soon after the country decided you were “it” for the next three years. But then, this is what we see at a change of Government.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Parnell sewer leak in Auckland also caused a flow-on effect of about $3 million in lost social and environment costs per day. A massive sinkhole opened up on St George’s Bay Road in September, spewing millions of litres of raw sewage into the Waitemata Harbour every day. The Institute of Economic Research says the total cost of the 50-day spillage ranges between $50 million and $166 million. Lead author Michael Bealing told Mike Hosking that part of it is lost recreation in the harbour.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Woolworths New Zealand&#39;s revelation of a 52% drop in profits is being labelled a &#39;PR fudge&#39;. The multi-national supermarket giant reported a $76 million profit for this year. Monopoly Watch financial analyst Tex Edwards told Mike Hosking that this just means gross profits are up $76 million. He says, essentially, there&#39;s an increase, not in operational costs, but in transfer of costs to Australia. Edwards says Woolworths&#39; profit margins are still approximately three times more than those of other supermarket companies internationally.</description>

Child Poverty Action Group spokesperson Alan Johnson says that overall, indexing tax settings to inflation is a good idea. But he told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s just an adjustment to make up for increased food, fuel, and electricity prices, and is no more generous than it was a year ago.</description>

Independent chair of the Gaming Machine Association of New Zealand Peter Dengate Thrush told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s unrealistic.

The media tend to take themselves far too seriously, so Winston has played right into their hands.
What they should be doing, of course, is seeing him for what he is - a bored, old troublemaker who found 6% of the bewildered and angry to stick him back in power.</description>

Winston Peters didn’t help with his claim at Government House yesterday that the media were bribed by the previous Government. That is categorically not true. But a lot of what Winston says has the seeds of some sense about them. What he is commenting on is the media&#39;s shocking performance around neutrality these past six years and especially the first three years and their lovefest over Jacinda Ardern.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Some nurses are giving up in frustration at being overworked. Nurses Organisation Kaiwhakahaere Kerri Nuku says around 75,000 nurses have annual practising certificates. But up to 5% are either not working in the sector or aren&#39;t in the country. Nuku told Mike Hosking that a nurse goes to work to deliver safe, quality care. She says whenever that&#39;s compromised, the nurses become more pressured and decide to leave. Nuku says that&#39;s especially the case when it&#39;s attractive to go to another job without that pressure or responsibility.</description>

It&#39;s been back in the headlines once again this week.
In some places in America they have rules and if you don’t comply they fine you. Not surprisingly, it&#39;s in the more liberal states like California, which I assume gives you an insight of what the whole idea is all about.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In a world, where increasingly the battle for renewables is being dented if not lost, how wise is it to find a solar farm idea near Lake Tekapo has been rejected because of the environment? You want to &#39;save the environment&#39; but you can&#39;t because of the environment? As Rishi Sunak opens more oil fields because renewables can&#39;t cover the gaps, as EV manufacturers pull back investment because demand falls, as many countries don’t know what to do about the increased power demand if more people do buy EVs, as the Australians increasingly worry about what they will actually do about power production, given they don’t have hydro like we do and as we still haven&#39;t answered whether we want to spend $16 billion-plus on Onslow as a bucket for dry years, it seems increasingly pointless coming up with ideas that may work at scale and yet they are turned down to protect the very thing we are trying to protect.</description>

You&#39;ve got your two prime examples: Chloe Swarbrick and her outburst on Palestine, and Willie Jackson and his outburst on a potential vote over the Treaty. The difference is one has an implied threat and the other doesn’t. Swarbrick should never have said what she said, it&#39;s inflammatory.</description>

If you win or lose by less than 100, I think it&#39;s only fair to test it. But how much pressure does that place on the Electoral Commission to have done their job properly. It&#39;s one thing to take three long weeks to count, but in a recount if the numbers aren&#39;t exactly the same, and my suspicion is they won&#39;t be, then just what was it you were doing all that time?</description>

She says they&#39;re now offering different programmes, which they find more effective.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Some questions around yesterday&#39;s White Island verdict: Was justice done? Was justice seen to be done? Did a lot of people needlessly get dragged before the court for no good reason? Did those who had their charges dismissed get any compensation for lost time and energy on a case for them that went nowhere? Is it fair that the law allows a Government agency to simply machine-gun a series of charges about the place, in the hope a few will stick?</description>

Even if a business fails, it may say nothing about the economic environment, it may say nothing about the specific sector it operated in, or then again it may say a lot.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Auckland University researchers have identified links between more Airbnbs in neighbourhoods and higher crime-rates. The findings —which use Auckland region census data— show it leads to lower house prices. It highlights how Airbnbs replace long-term owner occupiers with short term occupants, which can erode the anti-crime capability of the community. Higher density neighbourhoods —like those with apartments— are more affected than areas with single family houses. Nice Place Property Management Director, Keith Powell, told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s hard to pinpoint.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A major bank has increased the rate it uses to check potential borrowers can afford a loan. ANZ has upped its test rate to 9.1%. That&#39;s despite home loan rates sitting around 7% for a two-year fix. In past week ANZ and Westpac have raised interest rates. Squirrel Mortgages Chief Executive David Cunningham told Mike Hosking the test rate doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. He says the good news for first home buyers is that compared to two years ago, because property prices are lower, they can still afford the same amount based on the test rate.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A lot of talk about the match. But what about the game of rugby?
As I was watching Bill Beaumont hand out the prizes I wondered whether he has the slightest clue that he is killing the game&#39;s chances at the domination or growth they so desperately want.
For the sport&#39;s show piece, yesterday morning was a bust. If you expect the casual observer to tune in, as so many do for the pinnacle of sport, whether it’s the Olympics or World Cups or finals of anything at the elite level, you have to give them a reason to come back, and yesterday wasn’t it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Did the officiating and all the rules ruin rugby’s big showpiece?
The match officiating was under hefty scrutiny in the All Blacks’ 12-11 loss to the Springboks in Paris, with referee Wayne Barnes heavily relying on the TMO throughout.
The game saw three yellows and one red card, as well as questions over Springboks captain Siya Kolisi’s yellow not being upgraded to a red like Sam Cane’s for a similar challenge, as well as Aaron Smith’s disallowed try.</description>

An Infrastructure New Zealand-commissioned report shows streamlining delivery could result in savings of more than 26% on future projects. CEO Nick Leggett says if applied, these savings could increase the amount spent on delivery by between 2.3-billion and 4.7-billion-dollars a year, over the 2025-31 period. He says planning, procurement, and people become more secure, and as a result the money saved can be reinvested.</description>

He says as the crisis has unfolded and people have witnessed the disproportionate response of Israel, people are looking for a more qualified and nuanced response.</description>

She said no, based on some thinking within the Green Party that I say stuff they don&#39;t like.
Now, here is the problem with that. It shows an astonishing arrogance from the Green Party that, somehow, they feel as public representatives that they can dictate who they do and don&#39;t talk to.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There&#39;s no small irony yesterday in watching Sam Neill&#39;s lovely interview on the ABC about his diagnosis and ongoing battle with blood cancer.
His family featured some of his background and his arrival from Ireland. I didn’t know he was called Nigel, but hated being called Nigel so changed it to Sam.
It looked at his life in Australia and his passion project in Central Otago with that pinot noir that’s turned out to be such a success story.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Performing surgeries on the weekend is being described as a short-term answer to a long-term problem. Hospitals are increasingly running surgical lists on weekends to reduce the huge wait times which built up during the Covid pandemic. While that&#39;s helped cut some of the worst waiting lists, medical staff claim it&#39;s also contributed to a rise in surgery cancellations as nursing rosters are run thin. Association of General Surgeons President Vanessa Blair told Mike Hosking that weekend surgeries have been done before, but don&#39;t resolve the underlying reasons for long-wait times.</description>

CPI rose 5.6% in the year to September, down from 6% in the year to June. Michael Reddell says he hasn&#39;t seen anything which would give him confidence the Reserve Bank is trending towards the 2% target. He told Mike Hosking that the Reserve Bank shouldn&#39;t put a pause on OCR hikes. Reddell says they should have raised it last month and should raise it in November.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As the Labour party, still technically the Government of course, gather in Wellington to do that time-honoured thing of all losers, which is some soul searching, the trick is not to say you are doing it, but to actually do it.
The trouble, as we have discovered these past three years, is they don’t actually do anything except talk.
To search one&#39;s soul, one has to accept what has happened to you and take a level of blame.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What I enjoyed most about Saturday night was the message.
What National and Act have argued for, and got support for, is to take this country back to what it was - aspirational, successful, outward looking and positive.
For years we were the rockstar economy. When tragedy and upset struck as it did with the earthquake and the Global Financial Crisis, we didn’t buckle and we didn’t sink. We backed ourselves to work through and walk out the other side better off for the experience.</description>

Are you as fatigued as I am?
I&#39;m not sure I can put my finger on it, but this has been one of the more forgettable campaigns.
Maybe it was the fact we ultimately all know the Government will lose and another one will be elected.
No, we don’t know in what shape. But we know Labour is done and, because they are done, this campaign has just been a long drawn out goodbye with confirmation on Saturday night.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Concern about a gap between urban and rural students at med schools. Research from Auckland University has found that rural students had a 15% lower University Entrance rate, creating barriers for them to get into medicine. Paper lead Author Kyle Eggleton says it&#39;s due to fewer resources and higher socioeconomic depravation. He said that in urban areas you’re more likely to have single-sex schools and private schools, and they tend to be less deprived, which leads to better outcomes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The most recent polls continue to point towards a change in government. Surveys by Newshub-Reid Research and 1News-Verian both pick a National-New Zealand First-ACT coalition as the likely winners on Saturday. Former MP and political commentator Peter Dunne told Mike Hosking that there&#39;s no clear path to power for the centre left, and National&#39;s path increasingly relies on Winston Peters&#39; party. He says there&#39;d have to be a big surge in Labour votes to alter that, and the way the polls have been tracking all year it won&#39;t move more than one percent, which won&#39;t be enough.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I&#39;m not sure that MMP needed another reason to be hailed as a deeply flawed mechanism we voted for, not once, but twice. I still argue we did it because we were too lazy to have a decent look at alternative systems way back when we were deciding we hated First Past the Post. One of the more interesting factoids of the campaign was when James Shaw told us last week he had seen research that shows we are actually getting less knowledgeable about MMP as people are born into a system that they never really bother to study properly.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I have always had an element of sympathy for Pharmac in the sense the model we run in this country is a fiscal set of handcuffs. If you have a set budget you can only spend what you have. Other countries have models that have criteria saying if the medicine or treatment reaches a certain threshold, it is funded. Neither system is perfect and given the way medicine operates, there will always be someone who has a case or who has some sympathy behind their cause.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description National is now very likely to get an extra seat in the next Parliament. The traditionally safe National seat of Port Waikato will now be determined in a by-election on November 25, following the death of ACT&#39;s Port Waikato candidate Neil Christensen. In the meant time the 120th seat will be filled by a list candidate, likely to be from National&#39;s list. Otago University law expert Andrew Geddis told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s due to a rule that we inherited from the First Past the Post system.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description National&#39;s Finance spokesperson is defending her party&#39;s fiscal plan in the wake of criticism from her opponents. Labour is calling out the Nats&#39; proposed public service cuts. The party suggests National would have to cut $3 billion a year to the public services, alleging that even if all communications staff and advertising was cut from some ministries, it still wouldn&#39;t add up. National&#39;s Nicola Willis told Mike Hosking that savings will not undermine front line services, saying it&#39;s about backroom bureaucracy and reigning in wasteful spending.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the end of each week, Mike Hosking takes you through the big-ticket items and lets you know what he makes of it all.
NZ Rugby: 3/10
When it comes to the Ranfurly Shield, it&#39;s these sorts of examples that damage the reputation of the game, the administration, and running of the game and remind us that for all the greatness of the All Blacks and the Rugby World Cup there is a lot of very provincial, old-world dopey thinking running the machinery.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It was like a time warp for me this week watching Brock James and Brad Weber bumble their way through what passed for a press conference, answering, or not answering, questions about the Ranfurly Shield.
The whole way the rugby union has handled it reminds me of some sort of scandal from the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s. A bit of hush hush, let&#39;s not say too much, let&#39;s keep it to ourselves, if we have to we will roll someone out to offer a few half-hearted nondescript one-liners.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A warning to councils taking too long to comply with new water supply rules. Water regulator Taumata Arowai has sent a letter to 27 councils informing them they have till mid next year to sort a sufficient protozoa barrier. Regulations took effect last November, but the heat&#39;s really come on since Queenstown&#39;s cryptosporidium infection outbreak. Head of Regulatory Steve Taylor told Mike Hosking that they have the power to prosecute if compliance orders aren&#39;t followed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A shortage of New Zealand kumara from Kaipara has forced Nelson chip company Proper Crisps to temporarily switch to sweet potato from Australia. It had already opened a sweet potato factory in Yarra Valley in Victoria last year to meet demand across the ditch. Kaipara Kumara managing director Anthony Blundell told Mike Hosking that it&#39;s not a major blow to either party. He says that variety of sweet potato isn&#39;t too dissimilar to the kumara they grow, so switching to Australia is the best option.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Despite the sky-high airfares, air traffic numbers are almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Global traffic is now at almost 96% of pre-Covid levels, with August seeing an annual increase of around 28%. August domestic air travel is also up by around 25% on last year, and almost 10% more than 2019. Board of Airline Representatives executive director Cath O&#39;Brien told Mike Hosking that there&#39;s still some regional variation. She says while Auckland Airport is at 92% of frequencies back, Christchurch Airport is only around 79% recovered.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A tax expert says that National&#39;s proposed tax changes demonstrate the challenges of conveying complicated policies to the electorate. The party is defending its policy after it was revealed just 3000 households will reap $250 in tax relief a fortnight. They say the promised rebate to the average family always came with the caveat that it was &#34;up to&#34; $250. Geof Nightingale told Mike Hosking what he thinks the situation conveys.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description So the Reserve Bank call unfolded the way we thought. There was no change - for now. The “for now“ is the trouble. Where once Adrian Orr stood in front of us and told us 5.5% was it, it now isn&#39;t. To be fair to some of us that have been saying it for some time now, it was never going to be. Let us not forget that at 5.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There&#39;s a suggestion that pricing carbon might not be the only answer to deal with climate change. New research shows that relying on the Emissions Trading Scheme alone to de-carbonise would trigger petrol prices to soar by 60 cents a litre. Massey University Professor Robert McLachlan told Mike Hosking that making the carbon price go so high is unfair on consumers. He says when they looked at the international evidence, they found the ETS does work a bit but it can&#39;t reduce emissions alone.</description>

He told Mike Hosking that this delay is the norm, and it would be almost impossible to get them out on time.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Should I have been surprised? The debate around the Press debate has entered day two. If it carries on today that’s day three and that&#39;s two days too many. Sure, it&#39;s news that a Prime Minister gets ill and can&#39;t attend a pre-arranged event. But that’s about it. There is a certain irony that, having spent the past week deciding broadly that debates are a bit of a waste of time, certain players should be wasting energy and going out of their way to scrap over yet another one.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government&#39;s announced more powers for local councils to decide where new commercial forests are located, and new standards. It includes requirements to remove slash from erosion-prone land. Carbon forests will have to meet the same standards as plantation forests. Forest Owners Association President Grant Dodson told Mike Hosking that landowners should be able to plant the crop they want without having to win permission. He says if you own the land, you should be able to choose the best and most economic crop to put on it.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The country&#39;s red meat industry is still grappling with a volatile global market. Exports are down 16% to $730-million compared with the same time last year. It&#39;s largely down to a 44% decrease in Chinese exports, due to increasing competition. Meat Industry Association Advocacy Manager Jason Krupp told Mike Hosking that our high-quality product doesn&#39;t always alleviate the problem, as it&#39;s subjective. He says New Zealand has found a niche for itself in the upper markets, but everybody is doing it tough at the moment, especially those in the market for the first time.</description>

The party is promising two million hours of free literacy and maths tutoring for intermediate and high school students and a training fund to help teachers. Education Hub founder Dr Nina Hood told Mike Hosking one-on-one or small group tutoring is one of the most effective interventions. But she says unless the underlying issues of why so many young people aren&#39;t achieving literacy and maths are addressed, there won&#39;t be a long term change.</description>

Several pieces I have now read say essentially the same thing. Debate one was widely panned as being boring, unproductive, and certainly lacking any illumination.</description>

Category 3 homeowners presented to the Auckland Council yesterday, telling councillors that buyouts based on rates valuations would be too low for them to buy in their communities. Property commentator Ashley Church told Mike Hosking that under normal circumstances the council would negotiate a fair market value, but these houses won&#39;t be habitable again. He says the council has the choice of negotiating the best deal on behalf of the ratepayers, or sympathise with the residents and find a solution that allows them to get on with their lives.</description>

When the borders were closed, there were mass labour shortages and yet, there we were, with tens of thousands more jobless.
National will fix it and in fixing it remind us of what we once had as a country; discipline and consequences and expectations.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Labour&#39;s defending its idea of a fourth amnesty visa for overstayers, saying many are still incognito. If elected, the party&#39;s promising another one-off visa for people who have been in the country for more than a decade and were impacted by the 1970&#39;s dawn raids. Immigration Minister Andrew Little told Mike Hosking that even after the last couple amnesties, many people were still afraid to come forward. He said that this is a way of saying that for those who came here, raised their families, have been working, have been doing all the right things, they will let them off on this one occasion.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A new report has been released by New Zealand Initiative, looking into the Labour Government’s fiscal record over the past six years. The report found that Labour’s fiscal projections before the 2017 election were too optimistic, resulting in an $18 billion discrepancy between intended and actual expenditure by the end of 2019. Executive Director Oliver Hartwich told Mike Hosking that they were spending beyond what they planned before Covid, $29 billion more by 2019.</description>

The Events Association wants more grants, subsidies, and tax incentives to entice big acts to our shores. It says it&#39;s often not financially viable for shows to come here and extra investment would boost the economy too. Events Association General Manager Elaine Linnell told Mike Hosking that major artists know they can do a residency as opposed to a tour because it&#39;s cheaper, and they know people will come to them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This morning&#39;s call by National that they will deal with New Zealand First, if they have to, is exactly the sort of thing they should have been able to avoid if they took the advice of people like me weeks ago. The poll last week showing 82 percent of us wanted to know one way or the other shows how shockingly National misread the mood. By spending all that time and energy the way Chris Luxon did sticking his fingers in his ears, telling us he wasn&#39;t even thinking of it, he didn&#39;t want to talk about it, he wasn&#39;t above the threshold, he wasn&#39;t in parliament, it wasn&#39;t an issue, has all led to this.</description>

Here, in part I suspect, is the problem. A couple of events at local pubs have led her to make the comments.</description>

It was a bit over one million, which is about the same as the last election and down a bit on the 2017 debate between Bill English and Jacinda Ardern. I am reassured because engagement is critical and you could argue never more critical than currently, given the state of the country. Just because the result is a forgone conclusion doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be involved.</description>

When asked why Luxon wasn’t being “upfront” on what his coalition plans would be if he won, Luxon said the nature of MMP meant he had to keep his options open.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An education researcher says some of ACT&#39;s education policies would be a radical change while others are no brainers. The party wants to implement standardised testing, with University Entrance replacing NCEA Level Three. The B4 School Check would be extended to include education progress, and Early Childhood Education providers that don&#39;t contribute to child development risk losing funding or licensing. New Zealand Initiative Research Fellow Michael Johnston told Mike Hosking that one thing he likes is that schools can develop their own curricula, as long as they adhere with core requirements.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description So, the debate.
Firstly, I fear I may be wasting your time if you didn&#39;t see it. If you didn&#39;t, you didn&#39;t miss much.
If you did see it you will have been, I assume, bored witless.
If you were a Chris Hipkins fan going in I don&#39;t think he did anything to put you off.
Chris Luxon did well because it was his to lose. In fact, given the build up about him being new and so on, he did very well.</description>

Political Commentator Brigitte Morten told Mike Hosking that in the past, audiences would see politicians under pressure when it came to live debates. She said that since every press conference is now streamed live on social media, the pressure is off, and the debates just become a competition of talking points.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description So was this PREFU better than expected as a number of headlines suggested? Answer: possibly. Possibly not. What numbers were they looking at? It&#39;s important to point out this is not retrospective. This is not stuff that has happened, therefore cannot be argued with. This is a projection and the projection comes from Treasury. There are some numbers from their projections to ponder, such as we are not returning to surplus until 2026/27.</description>

But if you don&#39;t release anything you can be accused of a missed opportunity. But the literacy policy is more fertile ground for National given the record of the Government.</description>

Of course, they&#39;ve been campaigning for months, unless you are Chris Hipkins who upon receiving a poll a week or so back claimed he hadn&#39;t campaigned at all, until Megan Woods on this show busted him.
He showed ironically that same trait this week when he started defending Willie Jackson, who blatantly made stuff up about Act and National and the minimum wage.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Northern Infrastructure Forum says key highway projects will deliver game-changing perks. Its data shows the proposed Warkworth to Wellsford and Cambridge to Piarere routes would each add up to $500 million annually to our GDP once operational. That&#39;s $6 billion over 20 years. It would be generated through improved supply chain efficiency, resilience, and business productivity. Forum Chair, Simon Bridges, told Mike Hosking that the strongest message is that we should get on with these.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description One of New Zealand&#39;s smallest fuel companies is pointing to competition as an explanation for price disparities. The Commerce Commission has asked fuel companies to explain why significant differences exist within cities and between regions. Waitomo Group Owner Jimmy Ormsby says some pricing in the market is hard to justify. He told Mike Hosking that he doesn&#39;t expect the disparity to last long. Ormsby says some markets are too competitive and that won&#39;t last, while others don&#39;t have enough competition and will be forced to by regulators.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description More trouble for the carbon credit scheme that Labour wants to use to fund climate initiatives, and National wants to use to pay for tax cuts. The government has now tried —and failed— for a third time to auction off credits which would give businesses the right to emit carbon dioxide. That means the Government is short of almost a billion dollars it expected to have, as it heads into next Tuesday&#39;s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government&#39;s books are taking a short-time hit after its carbon credit auction failed for a third consecutive time. Businesses have again passed up the opportunity to buy credits allowing them to emit carbon dioxide, with the credits being put back on sale at the next auction in December. Labour wants to use the proceeds of credit sales to fund climate initiatives, while National wants to use the money to pay for tax cuts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description One of the reasons the Grocery Commissioner will largely amount to nothing is that they battle with ideas, as opposed to specifics. And ideas can&#39;t be regulated. As part of the Commerce Commission&#39;s review into supermarkets they found some of them bought land and prevented competitors opening near them. That is a &#39;specific&#39; and you can change those rules, and they did. You can also change the rules around how long it takes to pay someone like a supplier, so if they decide 120 days is too long they can make it 90 days.</description>

How they would do that, I don’t know. It will never come to pass because they need to get 5 percent, be on the right side of the ledger in terms of Government and then even if they were involved in some sort of arrangement, get that policy across the line, which of course would never happen.</description>

The All Blacks were smashed, England beaten by Fiji, Scotland were losing 6-0 to Georgia at halftime and Ireland snuck past Samoa. In the All Blacks game alone there were penalties galore and questionable calls which inevitably led to cards. So it isn&#39;t just the players under the pump but also the referees - and no one knows more about that than former international referee Nigel Owens who joined the Mike Hosking Breakfast.</description>

When you get a few reports into the sector, they never get the noise they really deserve. There has been a report into the CRL, the City Rail Link that is a fortune over budget and a mile behind in terms of delivery.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What makes the National Party&#39;s tax plan a winner is severalfold. 1) It&#39;s substantive. It&#39;s not pocket change. For many it is a material boost to their income. 2) It starts from day one, so what you get arrives immediately, not after years. 3) The taxes aren&#39;t the sort of thing that will scare people. If an immigrant or investor pays more to enter the country, who will complain about that?</description>

It was held for years by Gerry Brownlee until the Covid upheaval three years ago when Sarah Pallett, who never thought in a million years she would win it, won it. Raf Manji, who is TOP&#39;s leader, did what Gareth Morgan should have done previously and is standing in a local seat with the outside chance of winning it, thus avoiding the 5% threshold of MMP, which they were never going to get to.</description>

The star of that show is New Zealand first and the arrival of the Tight Five - Tau Henare, Tuku Morgan and all that particular cluster that eventually imploded.</description>

He says he doesn&#39;t need to take part, because he&#39;s leading the field by so much.
Trump will instead release his interview with former Fox host, Tucker Carlson.
Former campaign manager for Marco Rubio and now managing partner at Firehouse Strategies Matt Terrill told Mike Hosking Trump might not be there, but he&#39;ll be a topic of discussion.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description An Auckland secondary principal&#39;s coming to the defence of using artificial intelligence in schoolwork.
But parents are split almost 50-50 on whether it&#39;s a good idea, according to a Norton cybersecurity survey.
Albany Senior High School Principal Claire Amos told Mike Hosking instead of restricting it, we should instead educate kids on how AI works.
She says AI is already woven into Microsoft and Google platforms and most online tools that are used in the classroom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Criticism has come of the millions of dollars being spent to educate the children of our diplomats serving overseas.
The Taxpayers&#39; Union says the children&#39;s premium education costs taxpayers $5 million a year - with $800,000 going to children in the US, and $500,000 to children in China.
Union spokesperson Oliver Bryan told Mike Hosking it&#39;s a waste given the amount he claims diplomats earn.
Bryan says it&#39;s unfair for New Zealanders to foot the bill during a cost of living crisis, when our own schools are struggling.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A former Reserve Bank economist says the Official Cash Rate may not be able to be halted for long.
The central bank will give its latest update today, with economists predicting it will stay at 5.5 percent.
At its last review the bank expected it to remain at a restrictive level for some time.
But Michael Reddell told Mike Hosking you could make a credible case for at least signalling the prospect of some more tightening now, or in the next two or three months.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description General Practice owners say they are being priced out of hiring doctors and nurses as they cannot compete with salaries within hospitals.
General Practice are unable to increase revenue to match hospital nurse pay rates with their fees being capped by the Government - and any funding increases are being absorbed by rising costs and rising demands.

        <description>Podcast Description Winston Peters isn&#39;t giving up hope of being part of the next government.
The latest Taxpayers&#39; Union Curia poll has New Zealand First up a whopping 2.5 points to 5.8 percent, giving it the numbers to return to Parliament.
But the poll also has National and Act on 61 seats, giving it the numbers to form a government without the party.
Peters told Mike Hosking he believes New Zealand First actually has a much larger share of the votes, and will have far more influence.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The future of insurance seems to be a bit murky, with insurance costs only heading up, meaning more and more people are just not able to afford it.
Australian insurer Suncorp&#39;s New Zealand full-year profit fell 30 percent as claims from the floods and cyclone added to rising reinsurance costs and inflation.
Large reinsurance companies have changed their view of how risky New Zealand is, which inevitably means even higher prices for the cover and higher premiums for consumers.</description>

This, you might remember, against a track record of plenty of profit and success.
We have not seen the issues some have seen offshore. Banks in this part of the world have been wonderfully robust and performed well during the Global Financial Crisis and Covid.</description>

In 2011, 63,000ha of sheep and beef land was purchased for forestry, 11,000ha higher than first thought.

New Zealand is too loose around the edges these days, we have a touch of the feral about us, and it is tragically exemplified daily in our schools.

        <description>Podcast Description A pay bump is on the way for Te Whatu Ora nurses and midwives - who&#39;ve now accepted a collective offer.
It means strikes planned for tomorrow will not be going ahead.
The deal includes a pay increase, a lump sum payment and monetary recognition of the specialist nature of some roles.
Nurses&#39; Organisation CEO Paul Goulter told Mike Hosking the increase will attract nurses currently working in primary care into the hospitals, creating shortages in that space.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Part of the fallout from Friday&#39;s attempt by the Health Minister to convince us centralisation is working and people on waiting lists are getting seen to was the excuse, yet again, that Covid had caused at least part of the back log.
Many of us have grown tired of Covid as the excuse for everything.
Although I have no doubt it did play a part, and perhaps in some cases it may still be, what we are not doing and I doubt the royal commission is going to give it the weight it deserves, is asking - did it have to be this way?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Maori Health Authority is already tracking behind government commitments.
The Hauora Maori Advisory Committee report shows Te Aka Whai Ora underspent by about $66 million in its first financial year.
National&#39;s Health Spokesman Shane Reti told Mike Hosking that he&#39;s surprised how bad things are.
He says only Maori staff were transferred over from the old DHBs, instead of picking people who had the skills needed.
However, the Government says this isn&#39;t true.</description>

The fact is, most people in polling think he is a crook.
Very few doubt he didn’t do a bunch of illegal stuff. Equally, a lot of people think despite the fact they believe he did a bunch of illegal stuff, the charges are politically motivated.</description>

An Otago University study published in BMC Health Services Research interviewed 47 healthcare providers involved in care after treatment.
Lead author Dr Jerram Bateman says there&#39;s no central port-of-call for people.
He says there&#39;s a lack of coordination in care - leading to a lack of continuity in the cancer care pathway from treatment to the survivor phase.</description>

It totals about 25 percent of all the money handed out, around $200 million.</description>

To recap, you get $3500 if you speak Māori but it&#39;s not necessary for the job.
No job is not done because of a language issue. It&#39;s merely part of the public services desire, driven by Government demand, that we introduce a level of Māoridom that, in theory, addresses past wrongs, balances the ledger and pays appropriate tribute and importance to the Treaty.</description>

That is still an open question. But the demand for houses is there and then, what if, the National Party come into Government and open the borders back up to foreign buyers?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government&#39;s spent only a fraction of the amount it promised to spend on a meth programme.
Last election, it said it&#39;d spend $38-million this Parliamentary term to expand the Te Ara Oranga programme to four thousand more people.
But figures released to RNZ show it’s spent less than a fifth of that.
It has a 34% harm reduction rate.
Methcon Managing Director Dale Kirk told Mike Hosking that the industry&#39;s unsure why the money hasn&#39;t been spent.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description ACT&#39;s new transport ideas are being applauded, but some say the devil is in the details.
The party&#39;s latest policy announcement promises to replace fuel excise taxes with road tolls, and also includes foreign investment in infrastructure projects.
Transporting NZ Interim Chief Executive Dom Kalasih told Mike Hosking that tolling can be a real barrier to use.
He says when you look at the Penlink Road, the Ministry predicts usage will drop from 25,500 vehicles a day to just over 18,000, because of the toll.</description>

In an interview on Newstalk ZB, Ginny Andersen claimed the reduction in prison numbers is primarily due to fewer people in prison on driving and low level drug offences like cannabis.
However, Stats NZ figures show since 2017 the largest drop was offences against justice procedures, government security, and operations; followed by acts intended to cause injury; and unlawful entry with intent.</description>

The Government, now in full panic mode as they head towards election defeat, rounds up all the stuff they look weak on and then sets about making announcements about how what they have been doing for six years doesn’t count.

Burial costs, set by local councils, vary widely across the country - from just over $1,000 in Taupo, to $6,000 in Auckland, and more than $7,000 in New Plymouth.
Funeral Directors Association Chief Executive Gillian Boyes says the latest annual price increase adds to the financial burden for those relying on a Work and Income Funeral Grant.

        <description>Podcast Description I have found one of the Prime Minister&#39;s real skills - announcing bollocks with a straight face.
How is it humanly possible to stand there in front of the nation&#39;s media and tell us that when it comes to crime, when it comes to ram raids, we have had a gutsful.
Have we Chris?
When did you work that out, you insightful genius, you?
Did you work that out when the National Party announced that those filming these sorts of events will get extra sentencing, because it&#39;s an aggravating event?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The UK has relaxed their immigration restrictions for tradesmen such as bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, and roofers, making it much easier for them to get work visas.
UK Correspondent Rod Liddle cites this change as a failure of Brexit.
He says that the many people who voted for Brexit signed up for the idea that UK natives would be taught the trades instead of importing labour, but the focus is still on sending people to university instead.</description>

48 degree temperatures are expected in Sicily and Sardinia, while Rome is expected to hit around 44 degrees.</description>

He was later forced to clarify it wouldn&#39;t become a new offence, but rather an aggravating factor at sentencing.

Biomarkers are a molecule found in blood, other body fluids, and tissues that are an indicator of an abnormal process, condition, or disease, and could be a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer’s.
Otago University Researcher Dr Ashleigh Barrett-Young says that while there are several biomarkers could indicate Alzheimer’s, it’s still unknown whether there is a single one —or several— that are good indications in the pre-clinical or undiagnosed population.</description>

The revelation that the Government was indeed considering a wealth tax this budget has been blown wide open by the release of budget papers - and the Prime Minister confirming that he killed it.
For months now there has been a suspicion of this. I first got wind of it in a speech the Statistics Minister Deborah Russell made in Queenstown months back, on the work that David Parker had done around the so-called super rich.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Heightened demand in a changing police environment is shifting response time targets for call-outs.
Targets have been adjusted, giving officers twice as much time to get to emergencies in urban areas at 45-minutes.
Rural targets are up to 60 minutes from 45 - and police can now respond to fewer burglaries in 48-hours.
Deputy Police Commissioner Jevon McSkimming told Tim Dower they&#39;re seeing significant growth in call-outs.
He says there&#39;s been almost a doubling in family harm and mental health call outs over the past ten years - and they&#39;ve had to have an honest conversation about their performance goals.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Greens are promising a raft of rental regulations this election.
The party&#39;s newly-released housing policy includes a cap on rent increases of three percent a year and a national landlord register.
Some property investors worry that this cracks down on landlords, with one going so far as to call it landlord-bashing.
Others fear some may sell their properties if this comes in.
But Green Party Co-Leader Marama Davidson told Tim Dower that renters deserve liveable conditions, and there&#39;s significant demand.</description>

Institutions will get a piece of the $128 million pie, over the next two years.
Many have been struggling with declining enrolments and ongoing pandemic impacts.
Grant Robertson told Mike Hosking institutions also need to take a serious look at their financial books.

        <description>Podcast Description So the spin is flying, no pun intended, around the Prime Ministerial cavalcade to China.
How do you possibly defend the use of two planes, when one of them is empty? How do you, in a climate crisis, a climate emergency, in a Government that has called this emergency our nuclear moment, possibly defend this amount of climatic carnage?
The Prime Minister&#39;s office tells us there is a delegation of 45, in a way that seems to indicate that moving 45 people is somehow a bit new, or unusual, or complicated.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Investigative journalist Nick McKenzie has called revealing the truth behind Australia&#39;s most decorated soldier the toughest assignment of his 21 year journalism career.
Ben Roberts-Smith lost his defamation case against three newspapers who reported he had murdered civilians in Afghanistan.
McKenzie was the first to report the story - and has now released his new book Crossing the Line.
He told Mike Hosking no one - including himself - wanted to believe Roberts-Smith was a war criminal.</description>

If elected, a 40% cap will also be slapped on the amount judges can discount sentences.
Independent victim advocate Ruth Money says survivors of crime feel the discounts are getting out of control.

It would involve multiple controversial techniques, including a vehicle flying around up to 25 kilometres above the earth&#39;s surface shooting out micron-sized particles that affect the sun.

        <description>Podcast Description Fletcher Building insists it&#39;s in good shape, despite lower profit.
It&#39;s dropped its forecast to about $800 million down from its February prediction of up to $855 million.
CEO Ross Taylor told Mike Hosking residential builds have been a bit patchy lately, but the commercial sector is doing just fine.
He says in the bigger picture, less and less land is the pressing issue.
The answer to that is building smaller properties, or those with at least three stories.</description>

The most drastic proposed change is to take forestry out of the scheme entirely by creating two separate markets to form different incentives for gross emissions reductions and emissions removals - meaning emitters wouldn’t be able to use forestry units to pay for their emissions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As the economy sinks, the Government sinks with it.
What a shocking week.
We have officially been in recession. Don’t let them con you into the “technical recession&#34; line. A recession is a recession and going backwards is going backwards.
I have no reason to believe that in the past three months of April, May and now June things have changed. And I have no reason to believe the Reserve Bank is wrong when they forecast a recession, which, in this case, might prove to be a double dip recession in the latter part of this year.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description New Zealand may not be in a recession, but it&#39;s certainly in a slowdown.
On paper, the country has officially entered a &#34;technical recession&#34; after recording two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
But in reality, the latest 0.1 percent drop in GDP could be revised up, meaning the recession never happened.
Former Finance Minister Steven Joyce told Mike Hosking what is certain, is the economy is going through a rough patch that&#39;s going to take a while to turn around.</description>

Labour is giving local councils the authority to determine where, and how much, carbon forestry can occur.
The change limits trees used for carbon farming, being planted on productive land.
When asked if it&#39;s a climate initiative or a farming initiative, Forestry Minister Peeni Henare told Mike Hosking it&#39;s both.
&#34;Farming and forestry have a strong place in our economy in this country and if I compare that to the Nats&#39; policy, they&#39;re seeing freeze plantation for forests over the next three years and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the way forward.</description>

From 2025, farmers would be able to claim credits for trees planted on farms.

At least he did something, which is an improvement on Jacinda Ardern.
Ardern never understood that doing nothing wasn’t actually leading. It applied to policy and discipline.
It took astonishing amounts of poor behaviour, if not downright law breaking, for you to ever incur the wrath of a woman who hated controversy.
At least Hipkins understands in election season, at a time when the Government looks increasingly checked out, pretending what Wood did was a non-event, is a non-starter.</description>

If the Government were aiming for major change to the way we elect Governments they have got it, which is how these things work, of course.
You set up a panel of people, who you have an idea as to how things will fall. You then get them to recommend a whole bunch of mad ideas, have some public consultation, which isn&#39;t really public consultation, and then make the changes you wanted all along.</description>

Wood then publicly declared them in January last year, after learning that wasn&#39;t the case.</description>

There is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind, or I suspect anyone who has followed this, that she misled Parliament. It has been going on for several weeks now and her conduct has, at last, caught up with her.
You could argue this is a bit beltway - and it is.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Police Minister Ginny Andersen isn’t taking legislative change off the table as the Government attempts to stem rising violent crime, particularly offences committed by young people.
Both Andersen and Prime Minister Chris Hipkins have been clear in recent days that more could be done to address crime, which is fast becoming a key issue ahead of the general election in October amid reports of businesses closing and owners fearing death, while Opposition parties demand stronger penalties for offenders.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Argument has broken out over how much the Government is investing in our roads.
National claims the Government has reduced funding for State Highway maintenance by $164 million and local road maintenance by $314 million in this year&#39;s Budget.
But Transport Minister Michael Wood says while the Budget document shows only $430 million being spent on local roads, it excludes other funding methods.
He says $414 million of debt funding in 2023 will bring total local road funding to $844 million which is an increase compared to last year.</description>

The two right wing parties would be able to govern alone according to last night&#39;s latest 1News Kantar poll.
National would win 42 seats and Act 15 to put them in government with 62 seats.
Chris Luxon told Mike Hosking these polls closely align with its internal polling.

Fast forward 20-something years and history repeats.

The central bank has hiked the Official Cash Rate by a further 25-basis points to 5.5 percent, lower than the the 50-basis-point rise some had been expecting.
It&#39;s also indicating the OCR won&#39;t be raised any further, despite many economists predicting it would be.
Adrian Orr told Mike Hosking all indicators suggest that previous OCR hikes have now constrained spending and reduced inflationary pressure.</description>

The most recent report from the Racing Integrity Board, which is the fourth report into greyhound racing over the past decade, has found that injuries are still trending upwards, the industry has been slow to respond to track safety concerns, and there&#39;s an &#34;urgent need&#34; to improve data to understand outcomes for dogs that end up in rehoming programmes.

Reports of several categories of crime like serious assaults, acts intended to cause injury, robberies, burglaries and thefts have increased in the past five years.
On Sunday, Ginny Andersen says that was partly due to it becoming easier to report crime, such as through a new app.

Economists are now firmly divided on whether the Reserve Bank should keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 5.25 percent tomorrow, or raise it by a further 25 or 50 basis points.
But most economists now expect the OCR to peak higher than expected, due to the inflationary pressure of last week&#39;s budget.</description>

The Government lifted the abatement threshold in 2017, from a little more than $36,000 to $42,700.
Adjusted for wage inflation, the threshold would be just shy of $52,000.
Child Poverty Action Group convenor Alan Johnson told Mike Hosking inflation has eroded settings around various policy - and the Government should be more adept at responding, than it has been.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Auckland’s $5.5 billion City Rail Link (CRL) will not open until sometime in 2026 or later, the Herald can reveal.
This is at least 18 months longer than what was forecasted only a few months ago when the cost of the project blew out by $1.1b to $5.5b and the completion date moved from late 2024 to November 2025.
In an exclusive interview during a tour of the mega-project, City Rail Link chief executive Dr Sean Sweeney said the latest completion date is not when Aucklanders will get to ride the underground railway.</description>

Murphy said that the win meant a lot and was quite emotional for everyone involved, including his father: motorsport legend Greg Murphy.
The track was fairly small —only 2.4km long— so there was a fight for space, but Murphy said that fortunately there wasn&#39;t too much carnage over the weekend.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Job ads have fallen for the first time this year.
SEEK NZ&#39;s Employment Report for April shows the number of job ads have dropped one percent month on month, and are 16 percent lower than the previous year.
The national decline was driven by Auckland and Canterbury.
Country Manager Rob Clark says despite the drop there&#39;s plenty of demand for workers.
He says comparisons to last year were bound to be stark as April 2022 was near the peak of the Great Job Boom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Now, you can pick your word - but having done a lot of reading over the weekend around the banks and financial market&#39;s reviews of the Budget, the words I&#39;d choose range from concern, to alarm.
The bond rates jumped - that’s a bit dry for a lot of us, but believe me when I say it&#39;s bad.
What it ultimately means is interest rates go up, and anyone with mortgage money pays more, and floating money is already well into the 8% figure.</description>

Including a 20 percent rebate for video game developers and an allocation of $160 million.
Along with $27 million for a digital skills package with apprenticeship like pilot programmes.
Although it doesn&#39;t quite match what Australia has to offer it could help keep gaming in New Zealand.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson is branding it a &#34;back to basics&#34; budget.

Tax receipts are the sort of quirky idea people pick up on and run with. They&#39;re the sort of left-of-centre idea the media can have a bit of fun with.
The trouble with that, is that we actually have some important stuff to deal with and for every minute you talk about what sort of receipt it would be, how it would be done, and what it would cost, you aren&#39;t talking about things like our debt or our spending or our crime or the number of kids who aren&#39;t going to school.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Transport Minister Michael Wood has left the door open to delaying the delivery of some of New Zealand’s most high-profile roading projects.
They include widening the southern motorway from Papakura to Drury south of Auckland and the Ōtaki to north of Levin expressway.
The government is “rescoping” projects in the $8.7 billion NZ Upgrade programme, which includes 19 high-profile transport projects. The projects were announced back in 2020 but massive cost blowouts saw several of the most high-profile roads axed in 2021 despite a $1.</description>

I asked at the time whether this was bad news. They told us it was the market working as markets do.
The trouble with the answer was, although technically that is true, it was in fact a direct reaction, or reflection, of the lack of faith in the Government&#39;s climate change polices.</description>

Watercare has locked in a $116 rise in the average water bill from July and yesterday’s bad news that the council’s budget hole and storm-related costs have soared to a combined $375 million could lead to a rates rise of $446 for the average household.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the beginning it all looked a bit ridiculous to me, I was waiting for one of the military bands to break into the Liberty Bell march.
The over-the-top costumes, the silly horse-drawn carriage worth more than most British people will earn in a lifetime, thousands of military personnel rehearsing for days and weeks on end to walk not much than a kilometre.
And all this to escort a man who enjoys a lavish privileged lifestyle and we&#39;re supposed to bow and scrape to, purely thanks to an accident of birth.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Coronation ceremony is over but the celebrations are continuing as the day is dissected from every angle.
Royal correspondent Sarah Hewson said that the festivities were incomparable to most recent royal events, more similar to the Platinum Jubilee than any of the weddings or the Queen&#39;s Funeral.
She says that the kids absolutely stole the show, and the fact that so many people showed up to celebrate the new King and Queen despite their difficult history when it comes to their popularity and media presence would&#39;ve been relieving.</description>

She says pharmaceutical companies can have influence, and we don&#39;t know what that influence is in terms of how those campaigns are run.
Chief Executive Lisa Burns told Tim Dower that stakeholder management is critical in a campaign, as you&#39;re trying to get the right information to the right decision-makers.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are claims that Christchurch City Council is anti-car, following concerns over carpark access at Christchurch Hospital.
Figures released to Newstalk ZB reveal that the biggest money-makers for parking fines are all around the hospital.
The Hagley Oval carpark —one of the biggest earners— provided more than 108-thousand dollars in fines in the last financial year.
Councillor Aaron Keown says that the council pushed back on an idea which would&#39;ve seen 100 temporary parks added to Hagley Park.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description OPINION
It’s hard to know where to start.
But I had no shortage of time to work it out given I was seated in Westminster Abbey by 7.30am.
I wondered how badly time would drag given it didn’t start until 11am.
By 9am, the choir and orchestra began to play, and that was your first treat of the day. The sound in the Abbey is astonishing.
I was seated with members of the House of Lords and various judges who were wearing their wigs, which made me wonder whether that was the reason the King chose May for the coronation.</description>

“I think I was definitely a victim of this cancel culture which we have to endure. The reason I say that is I was put in a very strange position by a media company, who you would think understood what free speech means,” says Morgan.</description>

Along with previous comments from Megan Woods and Chris Hipkins we can conclude that some sort of tax attack is coming from this Government as part of their re-election bid.
My gut says their approach will go down in history as one of the most ill-conceived/mad hat ideas of the modern political era.
A Government in a recession with a myriad of social and racial issues at play, adds to their burden by trying to convince New Zealanders that paying yet more tax is a good idea.</description>

Years ago Rod Donald, the former Green Party leader as he was, was spruiking MMP and reassured us all that the tail would never wag the dog, despite most of us not believing a word he said.
Enough people got sucked in, MMP arrived - and so did Winston Peters.
The second great Green Party con was Julie Anne Genter telling us that the feebate scheme for cars would be fiscally neutral, despite the fact she could make no such claim.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description National claims empowering landlords to evict tenants without cause will help renters.
The party&#39;s housing spokesperson Chris Bishop says increased tenancy regulation has decreased supply, pushing up rent prices.
He told Mike Hosking the policy has caused landlords to fear renting to vulnerable people, as there&#39;s no way to easily evict them if things don&#39;t work out.
Under the current law, landlords can terminate a tenancy under a range of justifiable reasons, like anti-social behaviour or being three weeks behind on rent.</description>

But, KPMG Tax Partner Rebecca Armour told Mike Hosking there&#39;s an argument for one, where people in the same economic position pay the same amount of tax.
She says people earning $50,000 in salary have an effective tax rate which is much higher than someone earning the same amount in the form of a capital gain.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description NCEA; what a cluster.
Changes to both the curriculum and the assessment process that is testing to you and me - are being slowed down.
The Minister says this will help lift performance, and tackle those awful numbers showing about half our kids are leaving school barely capable of basic reading and writing.
What I read into that is that the Minister knows if we moved into the new regime now, the results would be as bad, or even worse, than last time.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government has announced a raft of changes to road licensing fees.
A learner licence will increase from $93.90 to $96.19 and the restricted rises $30 to almost $170.
But the cost of re-sitting a test comes down substantially, so on average, because so many people need more than one go, people will pay less to get licensed.

The $40-million expansion opened in November and new beds were added last month to lift the capacity from 22 to 30 beds.

So far only a few fully electric planes have crossed the Cook Straight, the next step being electric 19-seater planes, then domestic, before reaching zero emission international flights.
Paihau-Robinson Research Professor Rod Badcock says that zero emission flights will have both an environmental impact, but also a major economic one.
A large amount of New Zealand&#39;s GDP is spent purchasing oil from overseas, so switching to zero emission flights will give the economy a boost.</description>

At the end of the day, the only serious change I can see here is switching from four monstrous and unwieldy administrations to 10 monstrous and unwieldy administrations.
We&#39;re told this means every council gets a seat at the table. But despite the Prime Minister&#39;s insistence co-governance is long gone from Three Waters, it&#39;s not.</description>

Secondly, and most worryingly, is it was 50 points.
While Australia sees no need to move at all, we are still in the large end of the spectrum.
The Americans moved by 25 points, but we moved by 50 because of the size of our hole.</description>

Of those offenders, 51% of them did not face court action.

He says that the re-offenders are those who don’t have support available to them, which is a failing within the system.</description>

It&#39;s an almost 10-percent rise since last year.
Living Wage Movement&#39;s Gina Lockyer told Mike Hosking their research shows that businesses make cost savings elsewhere, so they don&#39;t pass on the costs to consumers.

        <description>Podcast Description The pandemic may have played a part in what seems to be soaring labour productivity in New Zealand.
Stats NZ data shows in the year ended March 2022, productivity rose 2.2 percent, the fastest rate in over a decade.
This comes in a tight labour market with unemployment sitting at 3.4 percent.
Iron Duke Partners Managing Director Phil O&#39;Reilly told Mike Hosking the rise may be a flow-on effect of Covid - as the Auckland and Delta lockdown took place in March 2021.</description>

Do you remember the Commerce Commission and the petrol industry? We were being fleeced by them, so a market study was conducted and, for better or worse, nothing really came out of it.
There was a little bit of loosening when it came to access at wholesale level and some signs to be put out advertising their high octane prices.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Federated Farmers says the Government&#39;s Severe Weather Emergency Legislation Bill is very welcome.
The Bill will remove red tape in cyclone Gabrielle recovery, including letting rural landowners in affected regions carry out emergency work without having to apply for resource consent.
Federated Farmers Hawke&#39;s Bay President Jim Galloway told Mike Hosking farms have been severely hit.
He says several have estimated their cost at $200,000 to $500,000 - and orchardists could have costs of $100,000 to $200,000 per hectare.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description National has labelled the Police Minister&#39;s attempts at reassurance over the country&#39;s increasing crime as almost sounding &#34;desperate&#34;.
Stuart Nash has painted a brighter picture on the issue, saying since Operation Cobalt, 28-thousand charges have been made - including against more than seven-thousand gang members and associates.
But National&#39;s spokesperson Mark Mitchell has hit back over the statements made by Nash on Newstalk ZB.
He told Mike Hosking it&#39;s likely traffic infringement notices are captured in the data and the statistics aren&#39;t stacking up.</description>

It&#39;s not the first time the Government has lost or has been found to err in court over Covid.
But this one seemed particularly egregious to me.
This, in a way, goes back to the Matt Hancock scandal in Britain where his astonishing series of WhatsApp messages, as well as email and text communications, during Covid showed just what a mess the whole Government approach was.</description>

Bayside Designer Homes is the latest building business to fail, leaving nine Auckland housing sites unfinished, and homeowners in the lurch.
Naylor Love Chief Executive Rick Herd says one issue is the boom and bust cycles.
He told Mike Hosking the second is the fragmentation of the industry, with a lot of small operators which don&#39;t have strong balance sheets.</description>

Latest figures from KPMG show bank profits reached a record high $7.15 billion in the year to September, up 17 percent on the year before.
It comes after the Government voted against a select committee inquiry into banking, instead considering whether to order a Commerce Commission market study.

        <description>Podcast Description Quick question around the cash bonanza yesterday - is it so blatant that it might actually work?
An extra $300 million we don&#39;t have, just splashed all over the economy as part of a $2 billion package, made up of stuff that got cancelled.
They are doing it because we have a cost-of-living crisis and we have a cost-of-living crisis because they overreacted to Covid.
It&#39;s very likely that on Thursday when the official GDP number is published, that we are entering a recession.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has burned several more schemes on his policy bonfire and splashed more cash in a welfare boost as his popularity continues to increase in the latest poll.
However, Hipkins’ second big policy reprioritisation, particularly in the transport sector, has ruffled the feathers of their political ally the Green Party, which claims it will only make the country’s future climate targets harder to achieve.
Several policies have either been cut, refocused or delayed to help free up the capital for the Government’s aim to reduce the cost of living, and Hipkins isn’t ruling out more former priorities being torched.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What a joy it is to start the week as we have for a decent number of years, with a sense that something good might be brewing at the Warriors.
It&#39;s easy to dismiss the Warriors and many have.
But it&#39;s also easy to get excited about a new year when you have a start that looked like the effort we saw on Friday night in Wellington.
I liked Andrew Webster when he came in to see us last week.</description>

Family Boost would give a rebate of up to 75 dollars a week for families earning up to 180-thousand dollars a year.
Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni says if that was offered, more people would sign up to childcare which would cause a cost blowout.
But National Party Leader Chris Luxon says that&#39;s been factored in.
He told Mike Hosking that he&#39;d welcome an increase in people signing up.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government is neither ruling in nor out an increase in fuel taxes as it works on a new transport strategy.
The plan, which will go out for consultation this year, promises a pivot towards public transport and away from emissions-intensive investments like highways.
It could mean swapping car parks for new bus lanes and cycleways.

An engineering issue has forced the Interislander&#39;s Kaitaki out of action —again— only one day after it had the all-clear to sail again.
The ferry hasn&#39;t been able to take passengers from the end of January when it lost power and had to make a mayday call.

Hundreds of furious Muriwai residents were left frustrated at a meeting with council staff yesterday, because they couldn&#39;t say when they could return.
The residents have been out for three weeks already.
Auckland Council Director of Regulatory Services Craig Hobbs told Heather du-Plessis Allan that it could be a matter of months before they can return, or a wait of up to two years to make sure it’s safe.</description>

Firstly, he is a vast improvement on the old one but already the cracks are showing.
He came in to see us this week for the first time, he wants to come in when the house isn&#39;t sitting, so good on him.
He arrived early; we told him to arrive at least on time because the last one who barely ever came in, despite the fact she was from Auckland, didn’t arrive on time.</description>

But it wasn&#39;t because they&#39;re greedy, according to the results.
57 percent said they did it because of the law stopping them from putting it up more than once a year, so they felt they had to.

        <description>Podcast Description The Environment Ministry is facing criticism for spending little on public transport.
Data released under the Official Information Act has revealed it spent more than $900,000 on flights from January 1 to November 29 last year.
It spent just $251 on public transport fares in that time, but more than $97,000 on taxis, shuttles and Ubers.
Act Leader David Seymour told Mike Hosking it&#39;s hypocritical.
He says it seems Climate Change is not a real thing to the people in the Ministry for the Environment - it&#39;s a bureaucratic process that allows them to lecture people.</description>

The Government says the rule change, which will require GST to be charged on rooms, rides and other services sold through online platforms like Uber and AirBnB, will create a level playing field.

While New Zealand’s air quality is generally considered good by international standards, Stats NZ’s newly updated indicator has linked pollution from vehicles and fireplaces to around nine times more early deaths than last year’s road toll.
The indicator data was calculated using the latest Health and Air Pollution in New Zealand (HAPINZ) model, which was published in 2022 and used 2006 and 2016 as base years.</description>

Yes, an announcement is coming this week, maybe even today, and it’s the return of the truancy officer. Not that we want to call them that, they&#39;ll be called something woke.

        <description>Podcast Description There are concerns the hike to minimum wage could be devastating for businesses.
The Government has announced the minimum wage will rise by $1.50 to $22.70 from April.
Business New Zealand CEO Kirk Hope told Mike Hosking the ability for businesses to pass this cost on is very low.
He says if a business has no capital left effectively to pay this, and can&#39;t increase prices because then they&#39;ll face a decrease in demand, they&#39;re in a difficult position.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Let me pose this one for Labour party fans.
So far this week we have a poll bounce, let&#39;s assume it&#39;s real.
Let&#39;s assume it sticks, which means the race is on and it&#39;s tight.
Also this week we have the IMF who have increased the global forecast. So the end times are not coming. In fact, a recession will be avoided.
Europe won&#39;t go into recession as a bloc and Germany says they individually are not going into recession.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Transport Minister is defending the ballooning cost of three Auckland train stations.
When funding for two new train stations between Papakura and Pukekohe was announced in 2020, it was expected to cost 247 million dollars.
But another station has since been added to the project, and it&#39;s now expected to cost about 495 million dollars.
Michael Wood says the third station was added after a 2021 review found it was neccessary to support the area&#39;s growing population.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You know, what we&#39;ve seen over the past couple of days reinforces what we&#39;ve all known for a long time about politicians.
They will say anything, anything, to get into power. And once they&#39;re there, it gets even more desperate: they&#39;ll say and do anything, anything, to stay there.
We&#39;re about to see in raw detail just how desperate Labour is to cling on for a third term.</description>

Latest analysis from Core Logic shows the most recent quarterly dip in home values was the smallest decline since May last year.
But the pending recession and OCR hikes are continuing to create uncertainty.
Chief Property Economist Kelvin Davidson says that it&#39;s not the best time for homeowners, but it&#39;s good time for first-home buyers.

        <description>Podcast Description Chris Hipkins is obviously not a man who&#39;s afraid of a challenge, and taking on the role of Prime Minister will be his biggest one yet.
Quick refresher here: the last OneNews Kantar poll put Labour 5 points behind National, and still sinking with 33 points.
The Nats clawed their way another point higher in the December result to 38, add in Act&#39;s 11 and you have 49: enough for a secure majority in the House.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It couldn&#39;t have worked out better for Labour... and by the same token, it couldn&#39;t have worked out worse for National.
Jacinda Ardern&#39;s timing in stepping down gives her replacement a full nine months run at the job.
And the replacement process —concluded quickly and cleanly— saves Labour the painful process of a leadership contest, a membership vote, and having to win over the unions.
There wasn&#39;t really an alternative to Chippy, with Grant Robertson ruling himself out right from the get-go.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The stars in our night sky are vanishing at an alarming rate.
New data published in the journal Science —collected by citizen scientists around the world over more than a decade— shows the night sky is continuing to become less starry.
That&#39;s largely due to light pollution from urban settlements, street lighting, and cars.
Astrobiologist Hari Mogosanu says that a clear sky isn&#39;t just a nice-to-have thing.
She says too much light and satellites means that we can&#39;t see objects travelling towards the Earth.</description>

Our GDP grew two percent in the three months to September, blowing most economist predictions out of the water.
But former Reserve Bank economist Michael Reddell says he&#39;s suspicious of the result and wonders if it will be revised to a lower rate.
He told Tim Dower it could be a problem next year.
Reddell says it will increase the chances of a recession next year, because the Reserve Bank will have to act more strongly to tackle inflation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description National believes there&#39;s another reason for Minister Nanaia Mahuta to be sacked.
It&#39;s been revealed the minister was advised against the controversial Three Waters entrenchment clause on October 25th - a month before she took it to caucus.
National&#39;s Chris Bishop says caucus decided against the clause in May.
He told Tim Dower the Prime Minister needs to show some leadership and sack Mahuta.
A spokesperson for Mahuta says officials weren&#39;t working on entrenchment policy in October, and instead were providing advice on a wide range of changes requested by Green MP Eugenie Sage.</description>

He was a nobody, he is a nobody, he will go back to being a nobody and a Government that wins with the numbers Labour did in 2020 brings in a lot of nobodies, who essentially hang out for three years making no impression whatsoever and basically wait for the tide to sweep them back out three years later.</description>

A trial using more invasive road safety cameras snapped 200,000 drivers using their phones, along with 42,000 seatbelt offences.
But no one is being ticketed because to do that would require a law change, which would likely be next year.

        <description>Podcast Description National is claiming bias from the Government&#39;s transport fund.
Councils can apply for a slice of the $350-million dollar Transport Choices Fund, for sustainable projects, such as public transit and cycleways.
Opposition Transport Spokesperson Simeon Brown alleges it&#39;s mostly going to Councils represented by Labour politicians.
He says Auckland&#39;s funding will primarily benefit Labour-held electorates.
Transport Minister Michael Wood says he&#39;s been clear they&#39;ll work with local councils, and he&#39;s reminded Labour colleagues to engage with communities on funding bids.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description House prices have fallen by an average of $90,000 in parts of New Zealand after a turbulent year in the property market.
That meant homeowners who bought at the height of the property boom in late 2021 could find themselves with mortgages larger than the value of their home, especially in Auckland and Wellington.
But there were also some positives: the fall in prices was allowing more first-home buyers onto the property ladder.</description>

Ruapehu Alpine Lifts is in voluntary administration, carrying debt of $45 million. The Government isn&#39;t throwing anymore lifelines, leaving the business that runs the Turoa and Whakapapa ski fields staring down the barrel of liquidation.
The company&#39;s demise would cost taxpayers up to $100 million because all infrastructure would have to be removed from the mountain.</description>

There are side effects for some such as brain swelling and researchers are clear more work is needed.
Alzheimer&#39;s New Zealand Chief Executive Catherine Hall told Mike Hosking it&#39;s early days.

        <description>Podcast Description Some fog cannons and a council initiative.
That’s your cabinet response to a death at a Sandringham dairy.
The suggestion from the Prime Minister was that Cabinet had been speaking for some weeks about the so-called business crime package.
It is an odd clam to make, given when Chris Hipkins, the architect of the package, was peppered about it in the house last week he never mentioned it was being discussed.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Pressure is mounting on the Government to fully scrap a provision entrenching parts of its Three Waters legislation.
Constitutional experts say the provision, requiring 60-percent of MPs to change part of the law, would pave the way for governments to entrench other laws.
Cabinet has agreed to refer the matter back to Parliament&#39;s cross-party Business Committee.
But National&#39;s Michael Woodhouse told Mike Hosking that doesn&#39;t actually fix the situation.</description>

The group&#39;s launching a campaign asking for higher pay and more resources to support the sector.

After heavy flooding on Saturday lead to the postponing of Cup Day, Riccarton racegoers have been offered a full refund on their tickets, but it seems to a bit of an empty gesture after Canterbury Jockey Club asked attendees to consider not claiming their share.
Staff spent close to half a million dollars setting up for the event and the club claims racegoers could still make the choice to support the club while it endures a &#39;challenging financial situation&#39;.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A $1.2 billion overhaul of the Special Education system was promised by the Government yesterday.
Instead of a bit of buffing around the edges it is said to be a whole new system of doing things, requiring significant ongoing new investment.
The overhaul would include teachers getting more specialised training for working with disabled children, along with families, teachers and ministry staff being able to decide what support each child individually needs, instead of leaving it up to a panel.</description>

The Government had offered the lobby group funding to act on behalf of employers that need representation and play a supporting role in the system more generally.
But BusinessNZ says it wanted nothing to do with the scheme, partly due to its compulsory nature.

Part of the reason Ron DeSantis got so many headlines last week was because he won well on a day the Republicans didn’t do what they thought they would do - and because a lot of people from all over the political spectrum wanted to rub Trump&#39;s face in it.

        <description>Podcast Description A glimmer of hope is in sight for split migrant families.

The issue was meant to be fixed by the Covid R21 visa, which replaced the family reunification border exemption, but instead left many waiting months in limbo.
Immigration adviser David Cooper told Mike Hosking most of the holdup has been down to police checks and national security checks, both out of the hands of immigration.</description>

“Ukraine’s defence was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles unfortunately fell on Polish territory,” said Polish President Andrzej Duda.</description>

Stats NZ data shows in September there was an estimated migration gain of 2,176 people.
But for the year ending September, there&#39;s still a provisional net migration loss of 8,400.
Sociologist Paul Spoonley says there&#39;s been an uptick in immigrants, but it&#39;s a long way to reach pre-Covid levels.
He says we&#39;ve tended to operate a brain exchange where the loss is made up by skilled migrants coming here - but at the moment there&#39;s not quite that balance.</description>

I do worry for the side given Smith and Sir Graham Henry are off to retirement and that’s a lot of brilliance leaving the building. And you cannot deny that what they did transformed the team.

        <description>Podcast Description Concern education is becoming less of a priority, as New Zealand&#39;s school attendance falls behind other parts of the world.
A report by the Education Review Office&#39;s evaluation centre has found only 58 per cent of students go to school regularly.
It&#39;s further found four in 10 parents are comfortable with their child missing more than a week of school a term.
ERO’s Ruth Shinoda told Mike Hosking it&#39;s a key problem, as parents don&#39;t appear to be prioritising school enough.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The trouble the Government have got themselves into with the petrol subsidy is that although we love it, we hate it.
Are we grateful? No, we aren&#39;t. Is petrol too high? Yes it is. Is the grocery bill too high? Yes it is. Is the cost of living too high? Yes it is.
So we&#39;ll take it, but we won&#39;t thank you for it. But if you take it away, just wait for the moaning.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government is taking aim at bank&#39;s massive profits by allegedly looking into open banking, with an announcement potentially coming this week.
Open banking is when you can move all your bank details, your debits, your mortgages etc between banks very quickly, creating high amounts of competition, as seen overseas.
The evidence shows that it brings banks profits down about 10 percent.

        <description>Podcast Description Preliminary data shows students are failing to meet minimum writing standards.
Data from trials of the NCEA literacy and numeracy tests prove students from lower-decile schools are falling behind, as only two percent of decile 1 students passed the exam&#39;s writing section.
Some say income inequality&#39;s to blame, as well over half of learners from higher-decile schools passed the writing standards.
These will be fully rolled out in 2024, and the Opposition&#39;s already calling on the Government to take action on education.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A 100-year-old grandstand at Christchurch’s Riccarton Racecourse is set to be demolished.
Canterbury Jockey Club has been granted permission to bowl over the historic grandstand, despite opposition from heritage campaigners.
The club sought approval to knock down the stand because repairing it would send the club into financial ruin.
Chief executive Tim Mills told Mike Hosking the stand has seen some of New Zealand&#39;s finest moments in racing history, but keeping it isn&#39;t an option.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I like people who put it simply.
Hancock Prospecting said it is unnecessary for sports organisations to be used as the vehicle for social and political purposes. Hancock Prospecting was, the emphasis on was, the sponsor of Netball Australia. It was a $15 million deal that got pulled by the head of the company, Gina Rinehart.
As we explained last week, sport these days is less about sport and more about virtue signalling.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the end, all of Boris Johnson’s bluster couldn’t hide the facts: He didn’t have the votes to win the Conservative Party leadership contest and stage a political comeback just weeks after being forced out as prime minister.
The former Tory leader raced back from his Caribbean holiday to test the waters and try to garner the support of enough MPs to proceed to the next round. But as British media counted the number of declared supporters for Johnson, it cast doubt on whether he could cross the 100-vote threshold.</description>

That notice was used to clear the hours, with Covid restrictions making it difficult for sentences to be completed.

Like virtually all of these sorts of breathless revelations, the real story is not as simple as it seems. But in simple teams, what is claimed didn&#39;t happen. It is not the scandal those who think it is, want it to be.

Auckland Airport has revised its 2023 financial year profit to between $100-130 million, up from $50-100 million.

Kiwi Water Park in Cromwell was looking at closure because of a traffic issue - the turn off for it was on a 100 km/h road and there was no right hand turning bay which did not please Land Information NZ or Waka Kotahi.
So they threatened to close the place because safety wasn&#39;t a guarantee on the road - until a contractor has come to the rescue and said he will construct the right turn bay before it opens this summer.</description>

Her reaction to the Gaurav Sharma resignation was to whine about the cost of a by-election. The vote costs around $1 million. Why she would worry about $1 million is beyond me.
She wasn’t worried about the $50 million for consultants on the cycle bridge in Auckland that went nowhere. Just this week, she didn&#39;t seem remotely bothered by the $44 million to consultants so far, and counting, on the light rail that has yet to see a millimetre of track laid, despite the fact she personally promised it would be finished last year.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A war of words between National and Act - over whether there should be a referendum on co-governance.
Act wants to scrap measures that share decision-making with Māori - and is making the referendum a bottom-line in any coalition negotiations after next year&#39;s election.
National leader Christopher Luxon told Kate Hawkesby the party opposes Three Waters but there doesn&#39;t need to be a referendum.
But Act leader David Seymour told Mike Hosking a referendum - and change in law - is necessary.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Weeks before he died, Peter Ellis told Newstalk ZB’s Mike Hosking in an exclusive interview he was &#34;feeling quite excited&#34; about the impending Supreme Court hearing, but hoped to live to see it happen.
After three decades, the Supreme Court has today called the investigation and Ellis&#39; trial a miscarriage of justice, and quashed his convictions.
It&#39;s found the evidence of an expert witness didn&#39;t inform the jury of other possible causes of the children&#39;s behaviour and simply shouldn&#39;t have been admitted.</description>

For the Court to consider the arguments posthumously means this decision will without doubt have consequences.
So it could set a precedent.
If the argument carries, and if say those convictions are quashed, then relatives and friends of other people who&#39;ve gone to their graves with their character in tatters, what do they do?</description>

Senior author Professor Louise Signal says there are few places children could escape the harmful messaging.

In a nutshell, New Zealand is desperately short of GPs, and a lot of those we do have are getting towards the end of their careers.

        <description>Podcast Description Adopting a policy to end streaming in schools is on the agenda for the secondary teachers union today.
Streaming is when students are grouped into different classes based on perceived ability.
The Post Primary Teachers Association is discussing it at its annual conference today and has recommended members push for resourcing to end the practice by 2030.
President Melanie Webber says it causes harm to young people.
She says it stops students from being able to access education and encourages them to make decisions about pathways very early on.</description>

Staff at aged care facilities are legally required to notify the Director General of Health when there is a situation that could put residents at risk.
It&#39;s called a section 31 form. In 2020 there were 260 submissions and in 2021 there were 851.
We are only in September and already this year there have been 2004 submissions - purely because of a lack of staff.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A potential solution has been raised for some of our labour shortage problems - but NZ businesses are reluctant.
We know that 20 percent of all roles can now be done remotely, especially in the likes of the IT sector.
And of those overseas there&#39;s a good chunk who would be keen to work for a New Zealand-based business.
Problem is, businesses here don&#39;t want to hire from overseas, even if they are Kiwis.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Christchurch councillors have given what they describe as the proverbial finger to the Government over housing intensification plans.
They&#39;ve voted against the Government&#39;s directive for new standards which would allow up to three homes of three storeys each on most sections in the city.
The issue they now have, while sending a strong message, is the Government can bowl through with it anyway by appointing a commissioner to force through the changes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description New Zealand’s terrible record when it comes to diagnosing prostate cancer is causing those who receive the diagnosis to lose hundreds of millions in earnings.
Research between the NZIER and Prostate Cancer Foundation found that on average, men who get a late diagnosis lose out on about $12,000 over four years.
While it might not seem like a huge amount, when you realise that almost 60 percent of cases are late diagnoses, it adds up to more than $300 million in reduced earnings over that four year period.</description>

“One being the heating costs have got so high that a number of growers can’t afford to heat their houses anymore, so we don’t get production outside of the main summer period.</description>

She went on to not apologise. She referenced Carmel Sepuloni, who also hadn&#39;t apologised. And by days end, no one seems to have apologised for the Northland cock up.
Not the Prime Minister, who referred questions to Chris Hipkins in yet another sign that she has basically checked out and essentially just lives for the overseas trips.</description>

He says these changes were implemented in other jurisdictions to try to get property off people obviously profiting from criminal activity.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Treasurer Jim Chalmers has put petrol retailers on notice as the government prepares to hike petrol prices by 22 cents a litre at the end of September over “misleading or anti-competitive conduct”.
As motorists prepare for the reintroduction of the full fuel excise on September 29 after a six month reprieve, Dr Chalmers has warned the consumer watchdog the ACCC will “ramp up its activities”.
The warning confirms — as expected — that there will be no extension of the fuel tax relief that was introduced in March as prices soared to an all-time high of 216.</description>

But they&#39;ve also confirmed what conservationists have long warned: these won&#39;t be enough to completely rid the country of possums, rats and stoats estimated to kill some 26 million native birds every year.
The just-published study marks the first strategic assessment of how various predator-busting tools could be deployed across the country at scale over the next 10 to 15 years – but matched to different environments.</description>

Employment law specialist Jennifer Mills told Mike Hosking the rule is legal, but still has some issues.

        <description>Podcast Description No sympathy for big corporates opposing a Government bill limiting the number of tobacco retailers.
Foodstuffs and Z Energy are lobbying against the proposal, which could see a 95 per cent reduction of around 8,000 retailers.
But Cancer Society New Zealand says maintaining thousands of tobacco retailers will hinder the country&#39;s Smokefree 2025 aim.
Chief Executive Lucy Elwood told Mike Hosking widespread availability has normalised the most harmful consumer product in history.</description>

Can they argue the GST treatment on KiwiSaver fees is not a new tax, given they said there would be no new taxes?
Yes they can, because GST is not a new tax.
But are you paying more tax because of the Government&#39;s move on KiwiSaver fees?
Yes you are.

Modelling suggests it will raise fees and mean $103 billion fewer saved in accounts by 2070.

Protestors are meeting in Wellington today for a self-styled &#34;people&#39;s court&#34; six months after their 23-day occupation came to a fiery end in February.
Wellington District Commander Superintendent Corrie Parnell told Mike Hosking they&#39;ve talked with both the Freedom and Rights Coalition and the counter-protest group.
He says they intend to go about their business peacefully and lawfully, and both groups say they don&#39;t want friction between each other.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Chris Hipkins says Gaurav Sharma&#39;s expulsion isn&#39;t pre-determined do you: 1) laugh or, 2) simply not believe him?
For a government that is this under the gun, statements like that don’t help.
Not helping either is the release of the letter from Sharma to the Prime Minister&#39;s office last December, proving this thing has been going on for a while and showing that despite the Prime Minister&#39;s office saying it’s all dealt with and it was all settled, the fact we are where we are, tells us that’s not true.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Government&#39;s defending the time it&#39;s taken to lure more workers here.
It will allow some sectors to pay skilled migrant workers less than the median wage, in a bid to address workplace shortages across the country.
It will also temporarily increase access to the Working Holiday Scheme to address the shortage of casual workers more generally.
Immigration Minister Michael Wood told Mike Hosking they moved as quickly as they could, once the borders opened.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The critical part missed yesterday in the great National tax scandal debate is not whether tax cuts are inflationary; it&#39;s the right of people to hold onto their money.
You can also add it was a storm in a tea cup, given it&#39;s not election year. Until it is, opposition parties shouldn&#39;t really be in the business of announcing policy because not all of us are engaged.
So, here’s some simple economics on tax.</description>

Issue one; they knew those offshore would get the money. So, money was going to people that weren&#39;t in the country, which was one of the Government&#39;s key criteria.

New modelling commissioned by the group Communities 4 Local Democracy suggests stripping councils of control of their assets, isn&#39;t worth it.

The cost-of-living payment is well intentioned, but oh so Labour in its delivery. In other words, it’s the usual wasteful mess dreamed up by a government that time and time again shows how little real-world experience it has.</description>

It follows criticism from his predecessor, Graeme Wheeler.
National Leader Christopher Luxon told Mike Hosking the central bank&#39;s work needs to be reviewed.
He says New Zealand&#39;s been outside inflation targets now for 15 months straight, so an after-action inquiry is a must to learn from the last two years.</description>

It comes in the form of a new paper, co-authored by former governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Graeme Wheeler, and the New Zealand Initiative&#39;s Dr. Bryce Wilkinson.
