NZ Rugby: 3/10
When it comes to the Ranfurly Shield, it's these sorts of examples that damage the reputation of the game, the administration, and running of the game and remind us that for all the greatness of the All Blacks and the Rugby World Cup there is a lot of very provincial, old-world dopey thinking running the machinery.</description></item><item><title>Mike's Minute: What a shabby response to the Ranfurly shield drama | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270378/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:22:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270378/</guid><description>Podcast Description It was like a time warp for me this week watching Brock James and Brad Weber bumble their way through what passed for a press conference, answering, or not answering, questions about the Ranfurly Shield.
The whole way the rugby union has handled it reminds me of some sort of scandal from the 80's or 90's. A bit of hush hush, let's not say too much, let's keep it to ourselves, if we have to we will roll someone out to offer a few half-hearted nondescript one-liners.</description></item><item><title>Steve Taylor: Taumata Arowai Head of Regulatory on the council warnings | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270379/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270379/</guid><description>Podcast Description A warning to councils taking too long to comply with new water supply rules. Water regulator Taumata Arowai has sent a letter to 27 councils informing them they have till mid next year to sort a sufficient protozoa barrier. Regulations took effect last November, but the heat's really come on since Queenstown's cryptosporidium infection outbreak. Head of Regulatory Steve Taylor told Mike Hosking that they have the power to prosecute if compliance orders aren't followed.</description></item><item><title>Peter Beck: Rocket Lab Founder on the space sector election commitments | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270380/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 19:44:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270380/</guid><description>Podcast Description Players in the country's space sector are optimistic over recent election commitments. National and Labour are both promising to grow the aerospace industry, including trialling and testing new technologies National will also appoint New Zealand's first Minister for Space, if elected. Rocket Lab Founder Peter Beck told Mike Hosking that the space industry isn't some future aspiration, it's current and it's booming. Beck says having a minister and a centre of focus to signal space is something we should invest in and is a good thing.</description></item><item><title>Anthony Blundell: Kaipara Kumara managing director on Proper Crisps switching to Australian sweet potatoes due to a shortage | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270381/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 19:22:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270381/</guid><description>Podcast Description A shortage of New Zealand kumara from Kaipara has forced Nelson chip company Proper Crisps to temporarily switch to sweet potato from Australia. It had already opened a sweet potato factory in Yarra Valley in Victoria last year to meet demand across the ditch. Kaipara Kumara managing director Anthony Blundell told Mike Hosking that it's not a major blow to either party. He says that variety of sweet potato isn't too dissimilar to the kumara they grow, so switching to Australia is the best option.</description></item><item><title>Cath O'Brien: Board of Airline Representatives Executive Director on air traffic numbers nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270382/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 18:55:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270382/</guid><description>Podcast Description Despite the sky-high airfares, air traffic numbers are almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Global traffic is now at almost 96% of pre-Covid levels, with August seeing an annual increase of around 28%. August domestic air travel is also up by around 25% on last year, and almost 10% more than 2019. Board of Airline Representatives executive director Cath O'Brien told Mike Hosking that there's still some regional variation. She says while Auckland Airport is at 92% of frequencies back, Christchurch Airport is only around 79% recovered.</description></item><item><title>Geof Nightingale: Tax expert on National's tax policy and the difficulties of conveying complicated policies | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270383/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 18:48:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270383/</guid><description>Podcast Description A tax expert says that National's proposed tax changes demonstrate the challenges of conveying complicated policies to the electorate. The party is defending its policy after it was revealed just 3000 households will reap $250 in tax relief a fortnight.

New research shows that relying on the Emissions Trading Scheme alone to de-carbonise would trigger petrol prices to soar by 60 cents a litre. Massey University Professor Robert McLachlan told Mike Hosking that making the carbon price go so high is unfair on consumers. He says when they looked at the international evidence, they found the ETS does work a bit but it can't reduce emissions alone.</description></item><item><title>Minor Leaders Breakfast with the Green Party's James Shaw | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270386/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:55:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270386/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Green Party's James Shaw joined Newstalk ZB’s Mike Hosking on the Minor Leaders Breakfast for an intense thirty-minute interview, to see if they have what it takes to make a difference in New Zealand.

He told Mike Hosking that this delay is the norm, and it would be almost impossible to get them out on time.</description></item><item><title>Mike's Minute: The debate over the debate | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270390/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 20:45:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270390/</guid><description>Podcast Description Should I have been surprised? The debate around the Press debate has entered day two. If it carries on today that’s day three and that's two days too many. Sure, it's news that a Prime Minister gets ill and can't attend a pre-arranged event. But that’s about it. There is a certain irony that, having spent the past week deciding broadly that debates are a bit of a waste of time, certain players should be wasting energy and going out of their way to scrap over yet another one.</description></item><item><title>Gary Stead: Black Caps coach ahead of the Cricket World Cup match against England | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270391/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 20:33:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270391/</guid><description>Podcast Description The Black Caps have arrived in Ahmedabad for their opening 50-over World Cup cricket match against England tomorrow. They played and won two warm up matches, winning by five wickets against Pakistan and seven runs against South Africa. Coach Gary Stead said the key for the World Cup matches is adapting to what is in front of them. He said there’s been improvement globally, and while he’s sure that there will be upsets throughout the tournament, the goal is to make sure they’re not one of them.</description></item><item><title>Graeme Jarvis: Medicines NZ CEO on ACT's pledge to have the Ministry of Health publish a medicines strategy every two years | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270392/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:55:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270392/</guid><description>Podcast Description The need for a regularly updated medicines strategy is being underlined. ACT's pledging to require the Ministry of Health to publish one every two years. Medicines New Zealand CEO Graeme Jarvis says Pharmac has publicly supported the need for a strategy, and it was also one of the findings of an independent Pharmac review. He says innovation doesn't stand still, so it makes sense to develop a strategy and refresh it frequently.</description></item><item><title>Pollies: MPs Mark Mitchell and Megan Woods on coalitions and forming government | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270393/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:44:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270393/</guid><description>Podcast Description National and Labour are continuing to argue over who's going to rely on who to form a government after next week's election. National's Mark Mitchell told Mike Hosking that Labour will need to make concessions to form a government with the Green Party and Te Pāti Māori. But Labour's Megan Woods says that National and Act will have to submit to the wishes of Winston Peters and New Zealand First.</description></item><item><title>Mike Inglis: Biosecurity NZ Northern Regional Commissioner on the outcome of Auckland Airport's express lane trial | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270394/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:33:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270394/</guid><description>Podcast Description It seems that Auckland Airport's international arrivals express lane trial has been a success so far. Just over 6000 passengers have been processed in the trial attempting to cut down wait-times at the border, which for some reached up to two hours last month. Average processing times from the trial have been close to nine minutes, down from the 13 it took in February without the lane. Biosecurity NZ Northern Regional Commissioner Mike Inglis told Mike Hosking that it's made a huge difference.</description></item><item><title>Andrew Kelleher: JMI Wealth Director ahead of the review of the official cash rate | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270395/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 18:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270395/</guid><description>Podcast Description New Zealand homeowners will find out whether mortgage rates are set to increase again today.

The party wants to implement standardised testing, with University Entrance replacing NCEA Level Three. The B4 School Check would be extended to include education progress, and Early Childhood Education providers that don't contribute to child development risk losing funding or licensing. New Zealand Initiative Research Fellow Michael Johnston told Mike Hosking that one thing he likes is that schools can develop their own curricula, as long as they adhere with core requirements.</description></item><item><title>Daniel Moxon: Formula 1 Reporter on Liam Lawson's performance and his future in racing | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270460/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 23:28:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270460/</guid><description>Podcast Description Kiwi driver Liam Lawson is seemingly set to receive some bad news about his future in Formula 1. Reports have surfaced that AlphaTauri are set to extend under-fire teammate Yuki Tsunoda's contract, likely at the expense of Lawson. Formula 1 Reporter, Daniel Moxon, told Mike Hosking that since they’re trying to fit three very good drivers into two seats, one of them is going to be left on the sideline regardless.</description></item><item><title>Mike's Minute: Thoughts on the leaders' debate | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270461/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 22:30:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270461/</guid><description>Podcast Description So, the debate.
Firstly, I fear I may be wasting your time if you didn't see it. If you didn't, you didn't miss much.
If you did see it you will have been, I assume, bored witless.
If you were a Chris Hipkins fan going in I don't think he did anything to put you off.
Chris Luxon did well because it was his to lose. In fact, given the build up about him being new and so on, he did very well.</description></item><item><title>Pollies: MP's Megan Woods and Mark Mitchell on the leaders’ debate, the prison policy backdown, and misinformation | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270462/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 21:21:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270462/</guid><description>Podcast Description MPs Megan Woods and Mark Mitchell joined the Mike Hosking Breakfast to wrap the week's political news.

How they would do that, I don’t know. It will never come to pass because they need to get 5 percent, be on the right side of the ledger in terms of Government and then even if they were involved in some sort of arrangement, get that policy across the line, which of course would never happen.</description></item><item><title>Kathryn Berkett: Child psychologist on experts saying mandatory school sports can have serious long-term mental health impacts | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654270551/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 22:11:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654270551/</guid><description>Podcast Description It's being suggested forcing children to participate in mandatory school sports can have serious long-term impacts on mental health. They also believe in some cases, it can destroy their relationship with exercise.

The Government, now in full panic mode as they head towards election defeat, rounds up all the stuff they look weak on and then sets about making announcements about how what they have been doing for six years doesn’t count.

At least Hipkins understands in election season, at a time when the Government looks increasingly checked out, pretending what Wood did was a non-event, is a non-starter.</description></item><item><title>Pollies: Andrew Little and Mark Mitchell on Michael Wood, Jan Tinetti and electoral changes | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654271030/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 21:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654271030/</guid><description>Podcast Description Andrew Little and Mark Mitchell joined the Mike Hosking Breakfast to wrap the week's political news.

The central bank has hiked the Official Cash Rate by a further 25-basis points to 5.5 percent, lower than the the 50-basis-point rise some had been expecting.
It's also indicating the OCR won't be raised any further, despite many economists predicting it would be.
Adrian Orr told Mike Hosking all indicators suggest that previous OCR hikes have now constrained spending and reduced inflationary pressure.</description></item><item><title>Cathy Wilson: Early childhood education leader claims the ECE Budget promised a Ferrari but delivered a lemon | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654271093/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 19:52:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654271093/</guid><description>Podcast Description Early childhood education leaders are claiming the ECE Budget promised a Ferrari but delivered a lemon.

The most recent report from the Racing Integrity Board, which is the fourth report into greyhound racing over the past decade, has found that injuries are still trending upwards, the industry has been slow to respond to track safety concerns, and there's an "urgent need" to improve data to understand outcomes for dogs that end up in rehoming programmes.

But National's finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says next year, the Government will collect $48 billion more in tax than it did in 2017.

Economists are now firmly divided on whether the Reserve Bank should keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 5.25 percent tomorrow, or raise it by a further 25 or 50 basis points.
But most economists now expect the OCR to peak higher than expected, due to the inflationary pressure of last week's budget.</description></item><item><title>George Wood: Devonport-Takapuna board member says Waka Kotahi need to review Harbour Bridge closure settings | The Mike Hosking Breakfast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/1654271108/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 19:48:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/1654271108/</guid><description>Podcast Description Between 12:30pm and 7:30pm on Saturday, the Auckland Harbour Bridge was closed five times.

Along with previous comments from Megan Woods and Chris Hipkins we can conclude that some sort of tax attack is coming from this Government as part of their re-election bid.
My gut says their approach will go down in history as one of the most ill-conceived/mad hat ideas of the modern political era.

It all came crashing down, as it was always going to, but with a number of strands as to how it played out.

It spent just $251 on public transport fares in that time, but more than $97,000 on taxis, shuttles and Ubers.

Stats NZ figures show consumer prices have risen 7.2 percent in the year to December, the same increase recorded in the year to September.

They've voted against the Government's directive for new standards which would allow up to three homes of three storeys each on most sections in the city.
