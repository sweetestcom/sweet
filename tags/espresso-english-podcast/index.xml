The most natural choice here is feelings, because we use the plural form when it’s a substitute for the word "emotions" in general.
We use the word feeling, singular, when we’re talking about one specific feeling. It’s usually modified with an adjective - an amazing feeling, a terrible feeling, etc.</description></item><item><title>Than vs. Then + 10 Common Expressions | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740015/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740015/</guid><description>Podcast Description ⭐ Download FREE Lesson PDF + Quiz: https://www.espressoenglish.net/than-then-pdf/ When should we use then vs. than?

Today we're going to practice pronouncing words with 6 and 7 syllables!
Before we begin, two important tips for pronouncing long words:
First, you need to know which syllable is the strong one, so that you stress the right part of the word. I'll show you which syllable to emphasize (you can also check a dictionary).
The other tip is to try it slowly first, then gradually increase your speed until you can say it at a normal speed.</description></item><item><title>10 useful phrases for talking about price | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740098/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740098/</guid><description>Podcast Description How many phrases do you know for talking about price in English?
You can say “it’s expensive” or “it’s a good price” - those phrases are ok, but very basic!
So let's learn 10 more phrases we use to talk about price.
I created two excellent courses to teach you daily life phrases like these - they’re my Everyday English Speaking Courses, levels 1 and 2!
Inside them, you’ll learn common phrases in the context of conversations.</description></item><item><title>Verbs + Body parts = 25 common collocations | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740099/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740099/</guid><description>Podcast Description When you put your shoulders up to say "I don't know"... is that called lifting, raising, or shrugging your shoulders?
When you move your head up and down to say "yes," is that called bowing, nodding, or shaking your head?
You'll learn the answers to these in today's lesson about verb + body part collocations!
To continue learning, make sure to get 1000 Collocations in 10 Minutes a Day.</description></item><item><title>30 different ways to use the word "run" | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740100/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740100/</guid><description>Podcast Description Did you know that the word “run” can mean lots of different things in English?
Today you'll learn 30 different ways to use this simple word!
Whew! That was a lot to learn and a lot to remember. What I suggest is trying to write your own example sentences with each definition or expression we learned today - so you can put it into practice.
A great way to expand your vocabulary further is to join my Vocabulary Builder Courses, which will teach you lots of useful English words - and help you practice them.</description></item><item><title>15 informal phrases with "NO" | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740101/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740101/</guid><description>Podcast Description The word “no” was probably one of the first ones you ever learned in English. Now let’s learn how it’s used in 15 different informal expressions like “no dice, no kidding, no sweat,” and more. I’ll explain what each expression means and give you an example.
Informal expressions are easiest to learn when they’re inside the context of a conversation – and that’s the method I use to teach them inside the Everyday English Speaking Course Level 2.</description></item><item><title>3 different meanings for "vet" | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740102/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 12:00:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740102/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today I’m going to teach you 3 different meanings for the word "vet."
Do you know them all? Let’s find out.
Lots of English words do have multiple meanings, and this is why it’s good to learn words in context, not in isolation or by studying lists.

askt (not ask-ed) pre-pard (not pre-par-ed) It’s a small mistake, but unfortunately it makes it obvious that someone’s not a native English speaker.</description></item><item><title>When do we use "shall" in English? | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740140/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740140/</guid><description>Podcast Description A lot of English learners are curious about the word “shall.”

So today I'll teach you more: You'll learn informal spoken expressions like "No hard feelings," "Join the club," and "Just my luck!" (that last one might be different from what you expect...)

So today I’ll teach you 8 common informal phrases that you might not find in textbooks - and I'll give you examples of situations in which we use them.</description></item><item><title>240 - How to use going to, gonna, gonna go | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740270/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740270/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today's lesson is all about the expression "gonna” and when you CAN and CAN'T use it.

But when I speak, I can't think of the grammar in the moment, or it takes too long to remember the rules. So how can I use grammar correctly when speaking English?"
This is a great question!</description></item><item><title>235 - English phrases explained: Good grief &amp; For goodness' sake | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740275/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740275/</guid><description>Podcast Description When you're studying English, I recommend focusing on learning phrases and not just individual words. When you only study individual words, it's hard to put them together into a phrase - but when you study phrases, then it's much easier for you to use the whole phrase when speaking.
The problem is that sometimes you might hear or see a phrase that doesn't seem to make sense. This often happens with idioms and informal expressions.</description></item><item><title>234 - Important: 4 major English-learning problems | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740276/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740276/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today I'll teach you about some common English-learning mistakes that I’ve observed among the hundreds of students whom I’ve worked with.
This lesson is going to be a little different because it’s not about fixing specific words or phrases; instead, it’s about correcting typical problems that language learners tend to have in the way they approach studying.
In some ways, these are the most important errors, because these habits or thoughts or attitudes are at the foundation of everything you do when you’re working on learning English.</description></item><item><title>233 - Watch out for these spelling mistakes! | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740277/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740277/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today’s lesson is all about spelling mistakes involving adding an extra letter to a word, or accidentally removing a letter from a word.

Another example is the root of the problem – the literal meaning of the word “root” is the part of a plant or tree that is under the soil.</description></item><item><title>073 - Talk to or Talk with? | Espresso English Podcast</title><link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740465/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740465/</guid><description>Podcast Description Today's lesson will teach you the difference between:
