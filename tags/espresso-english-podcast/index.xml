        <description>Podcast Description When do we use difficulty (singular) vs. difficulties (plural)?
I’m going to explain this and also teach you a number of collocations, typical combinations of words, to expand your vocabulary!
Learning collocations improves your English fluency because instead of trying to put a sentence together word by word, trying to think “which verb goes with this noun?” or “which adjective sounds more natural?” – instead, you’ll already know combinations of words that go together.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description A student asked me when we use the word feeling (singular) vs. feelings (plural), like in the sentence “I can certainly understand your feeling / feelings.”
The most natural choice here is feelings, because we use the plural form when it’s a substitute for the word &#34;emotions&#34; in general.
We use the word feeling, singular, when we’re talking about one specific feeling. It’s usually modified with an adjective - an amazing feeling, a terrible feeling, etc.</description>

In this lesson, you will learn how to keep a conversation going - with examples!
If you like learning English from conversations, then you will LOVE my Everyday English Speaking Courses, because each lesson is based on a dialogue. This is a very effective way to learn English phrases in context.
I think some English learners can be a little afraid of having conversations because they’re afraid they’ll have to speak for a long time.</description>

Sometimes the hardest part is simply starting a conversation.
Today you&#39;ll learn 40 conversation starters that native English speakers use in various real life situations – formal or informal, at work, school, or other contexts!
These aren’t especially “deep” conversation starters like you might want to use on a first date, when you’re interested in getting to know someone extremely well. Instead, they are more suited for “small talk” – casual conversation about topics of general interest.</description>

        <title>Difficulty understanding questions in English? | Espresso English Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740057/</link>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740057/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Has this ever happened to you – someone asks you a question in English, and you don’t understand it at ALL?
One reason for the difficulty is that when native English speakers are talking fast, we often change how we pronounce the words at the beginning of questions.
It can be frustrating and embarrassing when you don’t understand a question… but this video will help!
When you know about these pronunciation changes, then you can recognize them when you hear them – and understand questions a lot better.</description>

Download lesson text 👉 https://espressoenglish.lpages.co/long-short-vowels-pdf-audio/ A vowel is a sound we make with our mouth and vocal cords open, without touching our tongue to any other part of our mouth. In vowel sounds the air flows freely (differently from consonants, in which we block the air with our tongue, lips, or teeth).
Vowels in English are represented by the letters A, E, I, O, and U.</description>

        <title>Try pronouncing these SUPER-LONG words! | Espresso English Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740097/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740097/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Are you ready to try pronouncing some SUPER-LONG English words?
Today we&#39;re going to practice pronouncing words with 6 and 7 syllables!
Before we begin, two important tips for pronouncing long words:
First, you need to know which syllable is the strong one, so that you stress the right part of the word. I&#39;ll show you which syllable to emphasize (you can also check a dictionary).
The other tip is to try it slowly first, then gradually increase your speed until you can say it at a normal speed.</description>

        <title>10 useful phrases for talking about price | Espresso English Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740098/</link>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740098/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description How many phrases do you know for talking about price in English?
You can say “it’s expensive” or “it’s a good price” - those phrases are ok, but very basic!
So let&#39;s learn 10 more phrases we use to talk about price.
I created two excellent courses to teach you daily life phrases like these - they’re my Everyday English Speaking Courses, levels 1 and 2!
Inside them, you’ll learn common phrases in the context of conversations.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740099/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description When you put your shoulders up to say &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;... is that called lifting, raising, or shrugging your shoulders?
When you move your head up and down to say &#34;yes,&#34; is that called bowing, nodding, or shaking your head?
You&#39;ll learn the answers to these in today&#39;s lesson about verb + body part collocations!
To continue learning, make sure to get 1000 Collocations in 10 Minutes a Day.</description>

        <title>30 different ways to use the word &#34;run&#34; | Espresso English Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740100/</link>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740100/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Did you know that the word “run” can mean lots of different things in English?
Today you&#39;ll learn 30 different ways to use this simple word!
Whew! That was a lot to learn and a lot to remember. What I suggest is trying to write your own example sentences with each definition or expression we learned today - so you can put it into practice.
A great way to expand your vocabulary further is to join my Vocabulary Builder Courses, which will teach you lots of useful English words - and help you practice them.</description>

        <title>15 informal phrases with &#34;NO&#34; | Espresso English Podcast</title>
        <link>https://swiest.com/en/4005740101/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740101/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description The word “no” was probably one of the first ones you ever learned in English. Now let’s learn how it’s used in 15 different informal expressions like “no dice, no kidding, no sweat,” and more. I’ll explain what each expression means and give you an example.
Informal expressions are easiest to learn when they’re inside the context of a conversation – and that’s the method I use to teach them inside the Everyday English Speaking Course Level 2.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740102/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Today I’m going to teach you 3 different meanings for the word &#34;vet.&#34;
Do you know them all? Let’s find out.
Lots of English words do have multiple meanings, and this is why it’s good to learn words in context, not in isolation or by studying lists.
My Vocabulary Builder Courses make it easy to learn new vocabulary because they teach you “families” of words – each lesson focuses on one topic.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today I want to help you avoid a very common mistake that lots of people make – and that is writing the word “grammar” like this: G-R-A-M-M-E-R.
There’s actually NO “e” in the word grammar; the correct spelling is G-R-A-M-M-A-R.
But when we speak, we pronounce it like “er” – grammer, not gram-MAR – so that’s why people often misspell it with -er. It’s an understandable error.
There are actually lots of words in English that end with -ar or -or in an unstressed syllable, and we pronounce them more like -ER.</description>

Speaking of problems, idioms like these can be a problem when you’re learning English!

My course called 300+ idioms in 30 days will teach you tons of common idioms in a way that’s especially effective because it actually helps you figure out idioms from context, and also put them into practice yourself.</description>

You know how to say it in your native language, but you&#39;re just not sure how to translate it.
This is really annoying because even though you can speak some English, you feel slow and incomplete - you definitely don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re fluent.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today we’re going to do a vocabulary with pictures lesson to help you learn 20 words for shapes in English, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional ones.
You’ll learn both the noun form (the name of the shape itself) and the adjective form (how to describe something else with this shape) – in some cases those are the same, and in other cases they’re different.
Have you ever wanted to say something in English, but you just couldn’t think of the right word?</description>

I challenge you to try writing your own sentences with each of these phrasal verbs – because when you use them yourself, that’s when you really start to remember them better so that they will come out naturally when you speak English.</description>

askt (not ask-ed) pre-pard (not pre-par-ed) It’s a small mistake, but unfortunately it makes it obvious that someone’s not a native English speaker.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The pronunciation of many English words sounds different from the way they appear to be written. Some English words have &#34;disappearing or dropped syllables&#34; - reductions or eliminations of sounds in the middle of the word.
One example is the word favorite - we don&#39;t pronounce it FAV-o-rit with three syllables. Instead, we say it more like FAV-rit - the &#34;o&#34; syllable disappears.
In today&#39;s lesson, you&#39;re going to practice pronouncing some of the most common English words that tend to have dropped syllables.</description>

If you want to take it to the next level, try to use each one of these words in your own sentence.

I think it’s helpful to learn phrasal verbs in context, inside sentences, in situations where we’d really use them.
That’s the strategy we use inside my Phrasal Verbs in Conversation Course. It&#39;s an easy and effective way to learn the phrasal verbs that are so common in English!</description>

One very frustrating thing about the English language is that the pronunciation is irregular. There aren’t strict pronunciation rules that you could memorize and always know exactly how words are pronounced – it’s just not possible.
There ARE some pronunciation patterns… but there are also exceptions to those patterns!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description You probably know that an English word ends in -E, the -E is usually silent; we don’t pronounce it - like in the words date, cheese, fine, spoke, and rude.
But there are a few exceptions!
Many of these words came into English from other languages and so they don’t follow the typical trend of a silent E at the end.
Repeat after me to learn 12 words in which we DO pronounce the final -E.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Hi! It&#39;s day 4 of our Pronunciation Power-Up Mini-Course, and today&#39;s theme is brand names.
Nowadays a lot of brands and companies are really big and well-known – so we’re going to practice pronouncing 50 of the biggest and most famous brand names.
Remember, in your native language, you might pronounce these exact same names differently – because of the different pronunciation rules of your language.
But when you’re in a conversation with an English speaker, you’ll want to modify your pronunciation and say these brand names the same way native English speakers would say them.</description>

I really wish I could do ALL the countries in the world, but unfortunately we don’t have time in this short video – so I just took the top 50 countries by population size.</description>

Remember - in order to get the most benefit out of these lessons, you need to actually SAY the words yourself. Don’t just watch... speak!
Actually, if you want to challenge yourself even more, try listening and repeating with your eyes closed.
Why?
Because sometimes it’s actually better for you to use ONLY your ears, and NOT your eyes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Some English phrasal verbs are easy to understand, like &#34;give away&#34; or &#34;wake up.&#34;

What do these phrasal verbs mean???
Let&#39;s have fun today by learning 10 interesting phrasal verbs!
The problem with English textbooks is that they often teach you only the &#34;basic&#34; phrasal verbs like wake up, turn off, and get out - but there are thousands and thousands of interesting phrasal verbs in English, as you can see from this lesson!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Do you ever use the wrong word in English?
It&#39;s a very common problem - and it affects students at all levels, from beginner to intermediate to advanced.
These mistakes are especially common when the two words appear very similar - like &#34;interfere&#34; and &#34;intervene&#34; or &#34;relation&#34; and &#34;relationship&#34; - or when they seem to have the same meaning, like &#34;problem&#34; and &#34;trouble&#34; or &#34;staff&#34; and &#34;employees.&#34;
Today I&#39;m going to teach you the differences between all these super-confusing words I just mentioned, as well as a few more.</description>

In today&#39;s lesson, I’ll explain 10 idioms for describing strong emotions. I guarantee you&#39;ll learn something new!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After last week&#39;s lesson on common informal phrases, a lot of students e-mailed me saying, &#34;please make more lessons like this!&#34;
So today I&#39;ll teach you more: You&#39;ll learn informal spoken expressions like &#34;No hard feelings,&#34; &#34;Join the club,&#34; and &#34;Just my luck!&#34; (that last one might be different from what you expect...)
Let me know if you have any questions about these phrases - or if you have another phrase that you&#39;re not sure what it means or how to use it.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740269/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description There are lots of little phrases that native English speakers use in daily life. But if you don&#39;t live in an English-speaking country, then you don&#39;t have the chance to hear these expressions - except maybe in movies or TV shows.
So today I’ll teach you 8 common informal phrases that you might not find in textbooks - and I&#39;ll give you examples of situations in which we use them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today&#39;s quick pronunciation tip involves a very common verb: the word &#34;say.&#34; You might be surprised that there&#39;s slightly different pronunciation in the different forms of this word.
In this lesson I’m going to ask you to repeat after me, because the best way to practice pronunciation is for YOU to say the words and sentences out loud, not just watch me say them :-)

        <description>Podcast Description Students often ask me if we can use idioms and slang in professional situations - and the answer is &#34;it depends.&#34;

Today you’ll learn 15 English idioms &amp; phrasal verbs you CAN use at work.

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740274/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Today I want to answer a question that is important for everyone who is studying English. Many of my students say, &#34;I study grammar a lot and I understand it in theory. But when I speak, I can&#39;t think of the grammar in the moment, or it takes too long to remember the rules. So how can I use grammar correctly when speaking English?&#34;
This is a great question!</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740275/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description When you&#39;re studying English, I recommend focusing on learning phrases and not just individual words. When you only study individual words, it&#39;s hard to put them together into a phrase - but when you study phrases, then it&#39;s much easier for you to use the whole phrase when speaking.
The problem is that sometimes you might hear or see a phrase that doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. This often happens with idioms and informal expressions.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740276/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Today I&#39;ll teach you about some common English-learning mistakes that I’ve observed among the hundreds of students whom I’ve worked with.
This lesson is going to be a little different because it’s not about fixing specific words or phrases; instead, it’s about correcting typical problems that language learners tend to have in the way they approach studying.
In some ways, these are the most important errors, because these habits or thoughts or attitudes are at the foundation of everything you do when you’re working on learning English.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Today’s lesson is all about spelling mistakes involving adding an extra letter to a word, or accidentally removing a letter from a word.
There are so many words in English where these errors can happen, but again I’m going to focus on the most common ones.

        <description>Podcast Description Remember that mistakes are an opportunity to learn - and today you&#39;ll learn from the mistakes of other students like you.
Today&#39;s lesson focuses on errors that I and my teaching team have found frequently when correcting students’ homework.
Maybe you&#39;ve made some of these errors in the past, and now you know how to avoid them!
But maybe you&#39;re making different mistakes, and you want someone to check your English to see if anything is incorrect.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In this lesson we’re going to look at 7 common pronunciation mistakes in words with confusing combinations of letters..
A lot of students ask me about rules, like how do we know when the letter e sounds like ee vs. eh, or when the letter g sounds like juh (general) vs. guh (get).
Although there are some trends in English spelling / pronunciation, there are so many complications and exceptions that I’d encourage you NOT to focus on remembering rules.</description>

Two such expressions are &#34;give you peace of mind&#34; and &#34;give someone a piece of your mind&#34; - they sound almost the same, but they are in fact very different.
I hope this lesson has helped make these expressions clear!</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740293/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Today I&#39;m going to teach you three pairs of confusing words that have the prefix IN-. In many words, IN- means the opposite or &#34;not&#34;:
independent = NOT dependent incorrect = NOT correct However, there are some exceptions that might be confusing, and you&#39;ll learn three of them in this lesson: invaluable, infamous, and inflammable.
I hope this lesson has helped clarify the meanings of these confusing words.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740294/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Someone asked me if there&#39;s a difference between finish and finish up. The answer is no - there&#39;s no difference in meaning. Finish up is just more informal.
But is this the case for every verb / phrasal verb? No!
In today&#39;s lesson you&#39;ll learn the small differences between show and show off, follow and follow up, and several more verb and phrasal verb pairs.
There are certainly a lot of little details to remember when it comes to phrasal verbs.</description>

If you ever come across a phrase that you can’t figure out, feel free to e-mail me and ask me what it means, and I’ll do my best to explain it!</description>

One common suggestion given to English learners is to read or watch the news in English. This is a good idea, because you can learn how to talk about current events and relevant topics.
But there’s one BIG problem – If you’re reading or watching the news and there are words or expressions you don’t know, this can make it hard or even impossible to understand everything else.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740300/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description I received a great question from a student:
Is it possible to use ‘to’ followed by the ‘ing’ form?
For example, “I&#39;m looking forward to seeing you.”
Normally we use to + the base form (ex. &#34;I want to order pizza.&#34;) However, there are some specific words in English after which we use to + ING, and I&#39;m going to tell you about them in today&#39;s lesson!
English grammar can be quite difficult with all the rules and exceptions!</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Phrasal verbs are very common in everyday spoken English - and many students ask me about the definitions of phrasal verbs they&#39;ve heard in conversations, TV shows, or movies.
Today I&#39;m going to explain five phrasal verbs that you might not know yet: square away, step up, space out, blow over, and swear off.
If you come across (encounter) a phrasal verb that you can&#39;t understand, please e-mail me and I&#39;ll explain it in a future lesson.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description I want to teach you about a mistake that I often hear students making when speaking. It has to do with the difference between “I like …” and “I’d like …” It’s a very small difference, but it actually changes the meaning of the sentence and the way we use these phrases.

        <description>Podcast Description Today we’re going to practice pronunciation of words ending in -ow.
Make sure to check out my Pronunciation and Shadowing Courses for a lot more pronunciation training, including an evaluation of your English pronunciation.
I noticed a mistake that some of my students are making with this word: ALLOW. They are saying it like “alloe,” but it’s actually pronounced “allow.”
It’s funny, the words low (the opposite of high) and below (which means “under”) have the same “o” sound in “no” – low, below.</description>

In more official situations (such as writing a business report or formal letter), we avoid idioms. However, it is OK to use idioms in e-mails among co-workers as well as in conversations at work.</description>

This means that some people will get “bumped” to a later flight – they can’t go on the flight at the original time, and have to wait for a different flight later.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740464/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description A number of words in English are used metaphorically – with a meaning that is not exactly the same as their literal meaning. Usually they apply a quality of one word to another word.
For example, when we say that something is lightning fast, we are using the quality of lightning (which is almost instantaneous) to describe something that is extremely fast.
Another example is the root of the problem – the literal meaning of the word “root” is the part of a plant or tree that is under the soil.</description>

“I just bought a new computer. Was on sale.”
Every sentence in English needs a subject. In the second sentence, we need to say “It was on sale” – the word “it” functions as the subject, referring to the new computer.

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/4005740506/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Many English learners pronounce each word clearly, to get the pronunciation perfect – but native English speakers don’t do this.
Natural spoken English contains reductions - sounds that change and disappear when spoken at normal speed. This sometimes makes spoken English hard for students to understand.
Doing English pronunciation practice with reductions will help you speak more naturally AND understand spoken English more easily. Listen and repeat!
