to</p><p>keto of intermittent fasting Health</p><p>Nutrition anything that I say is</p><p>definitely not meant to replace</p><p>um any type of synthetic uh medications</p><p>um so just uh</p><p>check with your doctor before</p><p>implementing any of the things we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to talk about so I guess we have a</p><p>huge lineup uh so ask your questions and</p><p>we&rsquo;ll try to get to as many as we can</p><p>indeed and there&rsquo;s evidence of that uh</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to Jay from YouTube please</p><p>discuss the effects of Warfarin on the</p><p>body and what we can do to correct blood</p><p>viscosity naturally</p><p>well it blocks vitamin K1 so it um</p><p>it thins the blood because vitamin K1 is</p><p>something that coagulates and um</p><p>so</p><p>um you know people are given this for</p><p>risk for heart attacks because they have</p><p>maybe heart attack or some type of</p><p>arrhythmia problem or atrial fib and now</p><p>they have to keep the body from clotting</p><p>naturally</p><p>uh too much and so</p><p>um the problem is that you&rsquo;ve there&rsquo;s so</p><p>many foods you can&rsquo;t eat you can do the</p><p>yellow maybe red orange type vegetables</p><p>but how do you get your</p><p>phytonutrients if you can&rsquo;t do these</p><p>leafy greens that you really need it&rsquo;s</p><p>really hard so there are some natural</p><p>things to take to thin the blood like</p><p>for example garlic is one</p><p>um but there&rsquo;s many others as well but</p><p>in fish oils can help and also vitamin E</p><p>in the form of tocatrinals so these are</p><p>things that can naturally thin the blood</p><p>and so um</p><p>of course check with your doctor before</p><p>Switching gears but um I think they have</p><p>some new medications now that you can</p><p>still consume vitamin K because there&rsquo;s</p><p>a different mechanism I don&rsquo;t know too</p><p>much about it but you might want to</p><p>investigate that indeed okay Jay thank</p><p>you Doc and let&rsquo;s the very first person</p><p>today was Laura from YouTube I just</p><p>watched your video on ADHD I&rsquo;m taking</p><p>your electrolyte powder dmae</p><p>binfhotamine how many scoops of your</p><p>powder should I take daily I&rsquo;m also on</p><p>keto and iaf she is just fully involved</p><p>yeah it really depends on what you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to achieve and of course some you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s an enhancement to</p><p>um all your vegetables that you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to get the potassium up</p><p>um but you can take you know</p><p>um one two maybe three</p><p>um but for certain people that are</p><p>trying to deal with something maybe</p><p>really they need to spike up their</p><p>potassium</p><p>um let&rsquo;s say they have gout for example</p><p>maybe they do four</p><p>um but any extra potassium your body</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t need it gets rid of unless you</p><p>have a stage five kidney problem which</p><p>is very rare in which case you have to</p><p>check with your doctor but</p><p>um</p><p>potassium is there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about</p><p>with that but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s the most</p><p>important mineral</p><p>um out of all the minerals and and maybe</p><p>we&rsquo;ll chat about it uh when we talked</p><p>about some of the questions today all</p><p>right very good well uh just as evidence</p><p>of how many people just heard uh your</p><p>discussion on that we&rsquo;d like to say good</p><p>morning to all our viewers joining us</p><p>today from UK Canada Mexico

these</p><p>United States of America so thanks</p><p>everybody all around the world for</p><p>joining amazing and speaking of joining</p><p>we&rsquo;ve also got what we call the green</p><p>room and that incorporates certain</p><p>people and there&rsquo;s one nice guy from</p><p>Kentucky named Willie And Willie</p><p>um is sort of driving around making sure</p><p>that Kentucky college campus is safe and</p><p>and uh and so on so Willie uh why don&rsquo;t</p><p>we get you up uh hang on just a second</p><p>that didn&rsquo;t work okay Willie you&rsquo;re on</p><p>the air with Dr Burr go ahead with your</p><p>one question please okay can you hear me</p><p>perfectly okay all right I have a</p><p>question my wife had uh gastric sleeve</p><p>about three and a half years ago okay</p><p>she&rsquo;s had trouble with her stomach</p><p>burning and a lot of nausea and so she</p><p>goes back and they tell her that they</p><p>run a scope and they said there&rsquo;s maybe</p><p>some bowel in the stomach so there&rsquo;s</p><p>kidneys there&rsquo;s a gallstones in the</p><p>gallbladder so the gallbladder she had</p><p>the gallbladder taken out</p><p>right and there&rsquo;s no it didn&rsquo;t get any</p><p>better so they&rsquo;re still nausea they&rsquo;re</p><p>still burning and I I do your products I</p><p>do intermittent fasting I do apple cider</p><p>vinegar I do I&rsquo;ve lost about 50 pounds</p><p>doing it right so she lost 100 during</p><p>that what she had done so I&rsquo;m trying to</p><p>incorporate my</p><p>to her and when I give her the the stuff</p><p>the vitamins and things like she still</p><p>gets very nausea like she doesn&rsquo;t even</p><p>want to eat she&rsquo;s so nauseated and so I</p><p>still want her to get the nutrients in</p><p>the things but it&rsquo;s hard I don&rsquo;t</p><p>understand what to do is there any way</p><p>you could give me some good advice</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a little difficult</p><p>because when you get this sleeve you</p><p>alter the mechanics of this digestive</p><p>system and this uh first part of the</p><p>small intestine in the stomach</p><p>so um a couple things probably what&rsquo;s</p><p>happening is she&rsquo;s getting um</p><p>this backup of bile which can</p><p>regurgitate and it can just basically</p><p>feel just like an acid reflux but it&rsquo;s a</p><p>bile reflux that comes all the way up</p><p>into the esophagus and it&rsquo;s a very uh</p><p>potent detergent that can actually</p><p>irritate</p><p>um your esophagus so</p><p>um there&rsquo;s a couple things I would do</p><p>um I would do watch try to find my video</p><p>on the gallbladder flushing just to</p><p>manually massage the area underneath the</p><p>ribcage on both sides because</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I recommend for hiatal</p><p>hernia and it&rsquo;ll just create uh some</p><p>relief and uh</p><p>help the flow of things kind of go</p><p>through that area</p><p>but I think she&rsquo;s going to need a little</p><p>bit and you start off with a little bit</p><p>of betaine hydrochloride before sheets</p><p>and then maybe a little gallbladder</p><p>formula after sheets just to help both</p><p>on the acid and then the bile</p><p>um</p><p>what happens is there&rsquo;s a high risk of</p><p>getting um</p><p>deficiencies of especially like B12 when</p><p>you have this</p><p>this um surgery</p><p>um and so</p><p>you know he I think she&rsquo;s going to have</p><p>to kind of find some way to get these</p><p>nutrition uh factors in without creating</p><p>the nausea but the nausea is probably</p><p>coming because of the gallbladder she</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have a gallbladder so now she</p><p>just has one tube and it just drains and</p><p>trickles through</p><p>but she&rsquo;s always going to be deficient</p><p>because she can&rsquo;t concentrate the bile</p><p>so she&rsquo;s probably experiencing bile</p><p>deficiency symptoms that you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>have to just cope with and try to get</p><p>the right amounts</p><p>um but there&rsquo;s um</p><p>you know a lot of us side issues with</p><p>when you get that surgery but you can</p><p>still do fine but I have several videos</p><p>on it um</p><p>but of course um you know she has a lot</p><p>of um</p><p>probably other things that you didn&rsquo;t</p><p>tell me that would help me to figure</p><p>things out but that&rsquo;s what I would do</p><p>initially with what you just told me</p><p>um it&rsquo;s going to be trial and error but</p><p>sounds to me that uh oh tud cup would be</p><p>probably an important one to at least</p><p>stop the regurgitation of the bile</p><p>because it&rsquo;s going to thin the bile and</p><p>allow it to go through these ducts a lot</p><p>easier so</p><p>um I would I would do that</p><p>okay so that uh as far as like her sugar</p><p>like does that have anything to do with</p><p>like the sugar being high like in the</p><p>morning time because she has that</p><p>problem as well well that&rsquo;s because she</p><p>has probably very severe insulin</p><p>resistance and it&rsquo;s not because she&rsquo;s</p><p>eating sugar it&rsquo;s just that her body&rsquo;s</p><p>making sugar because of this insulin</p><p>resistance just hasn&rsquo;t been corrected</p><p>yet so I think with time it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>be corrected and there&rsquo;s things that you</p><p>can do to speed it up like apple cider</p><p>vinegar with water berberine cinnamon</p><p>chromium things like that but um</p><p>definitely watch</p><p>um</p><p>this video that I&rsquo;m going to release on</p><p>insulin coming up because I think it&rsquo;ll</p><p>explain a lot and especially I talk</p><p>about the production of new glucose</p><p>called gluconeogenesis for those people</p><p>that have bad insulin resistance and</p><p>she&rsquo;ll get some information on that as</p><p>well that&rsquo;s great well listen Willie</p><p>thank you so much and we hope that</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get back with us and let us know</p><p>uh how all that goes and we wish your</p><p>wife very well on her pursuit of Greater</p><p>health so uh let&rsquo;s see who are we going</p><p>to move on to now let&rsquo;s go back to the</p><p>internet Sunrise from Facebook how do</p><p>you get rid of calcium deposits does</p><p>that make sense</p><p>yeah it depends where it is I mean is it</p><p>in the joints is it in the arteries</p><p>um the the main thing that comes to mind</p><p>well there&rsquo;s two things one is vitamin</p><p>K2</p><p>so</p><p>um vitamin K2 helps Drive the calcium</p><p>back into the bone and out of the</p><p>arteries and out of the joints and uh</p><p>the best source out of all the sources</p><p>uh</p><p>um would be of course NATO but that&rsquo;s</p><p>pretty disgusting unless you have a</p><p>taste for it and you live in you know</p><p>Asia and you can do that fermented</p><p>soybean but</p><p>for all of us that can&rsquo;t eat that</p><p>um</p><p>like cheese is a really good source like</p><p>raw milk cheese fatty cheese and Munster</p><p>cheese if you can get it from France has</p><p>the highest amount but you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>get sufficient amounts in hard cheeses</p><p>and soft cheeses</p><p>of course the American cheese is not</p><p>going to have it in there so you can</p><p>pretty much I don&rsquo;t even think you can</p><p>call American cheese cheese but you can</p><p>call it a cheese product because I think</p><p>it has less than 50 percent of it cheese</p><p>yeah don&rsquo;t get me started on that Steve</p><p>all right very good well I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>start you what looks to be like a</p><p>medical exam question so here it is Mary</p><p>from YouTube my dad used Knight used to</p><p>use nitrogly glycerin pills back in the</p><p>day my doctor says I have</p><p>hyperlipidemia and need to take a Statin</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking Citrus Bergamot instead my</p><p>cholesterol is at 290 my triglycerides</p><p>are at 88 HDL 72 LDL is 204 and my A1C</p><p>is 5.5 should I be on statins there&rsquo;s a</p><p>mouthful</p><p>there&rsquo;s some natural things that you can</p><p>do for sure vitamin or vitamin B3 in the</p><p>form of niacin would be very potent</p><p>um the other thing would be very potent</p><p>that acts like Statin but with I think</p><p>less side effects is the red yeast</p><p>extract</p><p>very very beneficial you can also do</p><p>NATO kinase which will also help lower</p><p>your cholesterol and even sometimes the</p><p>Tucka can do it as well but</p><p>you know I&rsquo;m gonna release a video on</p><p>something called familial hyper</p><p>cholesterol anemia which is a</p><p>cholesterol problem that&rsquo;s genetic and</p><p>what to do and and actually this is</p><p>probably part of the questions so I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to just zip it right at that point</p><p>and just we&rsquo;ll talk more about it in a</p><p>little bit okay very good speaking of</p><p>question here&rsquo;s our first true falser of</p><p>the day doc</p><p>okay true or false high blood insulin</p><p>which is called hyperinsulinemia</p><p>is really a condition</p><p>of an insulin deficiency</p><p>okay so is that true or false audience I</p><p>know they&rsquo;ll be back on that in two</p><p>seconds</p><p>let&rsquo;s see Richard from Facebook again</p><p>what the best way to uh re-feed that&rsquo;s</p><p>an interesting way of putting it coming</p><p>off a 30-day fast good for you Richard</p><p>do it slow very slow with tiny bounce of</p><p>food not any</p><p>carbohydrates in any concentrated form</p><p>because that can create a a problem with</p><p>potassium</p><p>um but you want to do just a little bit</p><p>a little bit of maybe a little bit of um</p><p>salad or a little bit of uh</p><p>um maybe some an avocado or maybe an egg</p><p>and then wait for a couple hours and</p><p>have a little bit more and then wait for</p><p>a little bit and have a little bit more</p><p>as you ease into this over three days</p><p>because</p><p>um your system has been adapted to</p><p>um not eating so you don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>overdo it because you can create a an</p><p>imbalance</p><p>all right well on the other hand it&rsquo;s</p><p>free French fry Friday at McDonald&rsquo;s so</p><p>um</p><p>um you know you might want to really</p><p>yeah might want to go with the medium</p><p>instead of a large that&rsquo;s good no yeah</p><p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see now</p><p>Harley dog from Facebook shingles on my</p><p>face for a year how do I get rid of that</p><p>I understand that&rsquo;s awful</p><p>yeah</p><p>I did several videos on that I would</p><p>watch the latest version to get the full</p><p>scoop on what you can do</p><p>um with various remedies but um you got</p><p>to realize that shingles virus started</p><p>out as a chickenpox virus</p><p>okay and um it comes out later in life</p><p>out of remission</p><p>um during stress events</p><p>especially like losses or emotional</p><p>stress so that being said you have to do</p><p>everything you can</p><p>to knock out that stressful situation</p><p>and um</p><p>then you&rsquo;re going to see Improvement but</p><p>it&rsquo;s kind of what happens when you have</p><p>this Spike of cortisol</p><p>it paralyzes the immune system and</p><p>allows for these viruses to come out of</p><p>remission and kind of kick you when</p><p>you&rsquo;re down</p><p>so it&rsquo;s all about just strengthening the</p><p>immune system and then getting your</p><p>assistant to a point where</p><p>um it can keep that virus in remission</p><p>foreign</p><p>horse that&rsquo;s an interesting name from</p><p>YouTube I have a friend that just had</p><p>surgery to remove polyps from the</p><p>bladder from the bladder interesting</p><p>they keep coming back what should they</p><p>do is he maybe the intestine there&rsquo;s a</p><p>bladder polyp such a thing</p><p>it could be it could be in the uh</p><p>urinary bladder too</p><p>so I think um what I would do</p><p>um</p><p>polyps are kind of like</p><p>usually your body is trying to</p><p>encapsulate something to protect</p><p>something and um yeah I would go back to</p><p>the basics are you eating the healthy</p><p>version of Keto are you doing things to</p><p>increase your detoxification like</p><p>cruciferous vegetables some people as</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing some like a deep dive in some</p><p>of this genetic stuff</p><p>um have very um</p><p>big problems with their detox genes and</p><p>they tend to hold poisons longer and</p><p>then they could you know develop cysts</p><p>and even polyps more frequently but</p><p>polyps could also you know very rarely</p><p>kind of a form of a tumor could be</p><p>benign</p><p>um it could be malignant but those are</p><p>very rare</p><p>so um the best thing to do is to go back</p><p>to the basics and then eat as if you&rsquo;re</p><p>preventing cancer</p><p>um because I think it&rsquo;s illegal to cure</p><p>cancer in in the United States at least</p><p>is from my knowledge so you don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to do that but if you can prevent it</p><p>that&rsquo;s even better very good it would</p><p>appear Helena from Ireland on YouTube</p><p>I&rsquo;m 50 and have menopause symptoms what</p><p>are your views on bioidentical hormone</p><p>creams</p><p>it comes with the package anytime you</p><p>take um hormones you</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s like why do you um why</p><p>isn&rsquo;t your gland making the hormones and</p><p>you say well I&rsquo;m just age right well</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t your body</p><p>um make enough I like shouldn&rsquo;t the</p><p>backup organs like the adrenals take</p><p>over and make enough if they&rsquo;re strong</p><p>enough but when you start taking</p><p>hormones and you bypass your own</p><p>glandular production</p><p>then the clients don&rsquo;t have to produce</p><p>as much so then you become more and more</p><p>dependent on those hormones which give</p><p>you another problem now you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>constantly having to deal with hormones</p><p>so what would wouldn&rsquo;t a better approach</p><p>be to strengthen the gland like I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about the adrenal gland with</p><p>maybe a desiccated adrenal support or an</p><p>adaptogen like ashwagandha that you can</p><p>actually support that adrenal</p><p>um to then get your gland to produce</p><p>more and also all these sex hormones</p><p>that are produced after especially after</p><p>menopause that are dependent on the</p><p>adrenals</p><p>um need this raw material which is from</p><p>cholesterol so definitely do not start</p><p>to go on a low-fat diet if you&rsquo;re going</p><p>through menopause</p><p>all right very good now listen I want to</p><p>remind everybody that in addition to</p><p>YouTube you can go to this great free</p><p>app for Android uh and on uh Mac systems</p><p>OS so get that for a quick reference to</p><p>all the great videos that Dr Berg has</p><p>mentioned and of course drberg.com will</p><p>lead you through all of his programs and</p><p>so on which millions of people and Steve</p><p>I just want to um sometimes I like I if</p><p>I find a good product</p><p>I will talk about it promote it I&rsquo;m not</p><p>affiliated with these two products I</p><p>want to recommend but I just stumbled on</p><p>two products and I&rsquo;d mentioned one last</p><p>week but this is a pretty good one that</p><p>I&rsquo;d like I&rsquo;m going to tell you why it&rsquo;s</p><p>the it&rsquo;s a company called hom</p><p>okay if you can see that right there huh</p><p>we can hom House of macadamia</p><p>dipped in chocolate what you know what I</p><p>like about this one</p><p>is um these little like treats for like</p><p>a dessert it doesn&rsquo;t have all the extra</p><p>like</p><p>garbage that you see it&rsquo;s like chocolate</p><p>coating okay cocoa butter</p><p>erythritol cocoa powder chicory root</p><p>um</p><p>and then sunflower lecithin and sea salt</p><p>that&rsquo;s it and they&rsquo;re not the rancid</p><p>macadamia nuts that you usually find so</p><p>I like those as a I definitely would</p><p>recommend that um product as a kind of a</p><p>dessert and again I&rsquo;m not getting any</p><p>Kickbacks on this and then the other one</p><p>the way I was looking at is this row</p><p>these ROM sticks right here</p><p>these are actually pork sticks if you</p><p>can see them and you know</p><p>when you get fermented sausage or meat</p><p>it always comes with a lot of sugar and</p><p>so one of the ingredients for this</p><p>because I was really impressed with how</p><p>they treat their animals and how they</p><p>raise these pigs and um</p><p>like pasture raised is actually quite</p><p>fascinating but you know there&rsquo;s a</p><p>little tiny bit of sugar so I actually</p><p>just reached it I said couldn&rsquo;t you just</p><p>make these without sugar and then they</p><p>would be even better and the problem is</p><p>when you try to ferment something you</p><p>have to feed the microbes something some</p><p>carbohydrate so they add a little tiny</p><p>bit of carb and then I says well why</p><p>don&rsquo;t you just do the test and see and</p><p>tell me how much sugar is in there they</p><p>just sent me the report it&rsquo;s less than</p><p>one gram and I&rsquo;m like wow that&rsquo;s cool</p><p>so this has a very tiny tiny tiny bit</p><p>just to feed because the microbes eat</p><p>most of it and there&rsquo;s just a tiny bit</p><p>left so you&rsquo;re talking about like when</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing Keto</p><p>um a maximum of not going over 50 grams</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking about something that has</p><p>0.5 grams</p><p>of sugar so that&rsquo;s so insignificant I</p><p>think it&rsquo;ll be okay to consume as a in</p><p>addition to you know whatever Keto Plan</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing but the Rome sticks uh it&rsquo;s</p><p>another good company I like the way that</p><p>they</p><p>their Farms that&rsquo;s the most important</p><p>thing and they&rsquo;re very transparent so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little shout out to that company</p><p>well it&rsquo;s incredible doc I was bragging</p><p>to those in the green room I said you</p><p>know Dr Berg is not prejudiced in any</p><p>one sort of approach to health or the</p><p>other Western medicine is great this</p><p>that and the other uh but no but you you</p><p>look to what works and does an enormous</p><p>amount of study to find out the things</p><p>that work and don&rsquo;t and there&rsquo;s plenty</p><p>of evidence so there&rsquo;s proof of it he&rsquo;s</p><p>not kicking a gram of sugar there or</p><p>whatever and I think that&rsquo;s great and I</p><p>really I think everyone is in for the</p><p>ethical treatment of animals they&rsquo;re</p><p>delicious but they should be treated</p><p>with respect so that&rsquo;s great to know</p><p>that that product is aiming for that</p><p>okay let&rsquo;s see I bet we&rsquo;ve got an answer</p><p>to one of our questions and we do uh</p><p>quiz question number one it&rsquo;s a true</p><p>falser and it asked high blood insulin</p><p>hyper and salemia I didn&rsquo;t say that</p><p>right but you can do it for us but</p><p>really a condition of insulin deficiency</p><p>okay and</p><p>um with that 55 percent of our</p><p>respondents say it&rsquo;s true in the balance</p><p>which is 45 say ah it&rsquo;s false</p><p>this is a very interesting video I&rsquo;ll</p><p>release on this topic but</p><p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of conflicting</p><p>information in in and confusion in this</p><p>area of insulin because on one hand</p><p>bodybuilders use it as a way to build</p><p>their muscles</p><p>um insulin is even an anti-inflammatory</p><p>yes it&rsquo;s true they use as a nasal spray</p><p>to help you with prevent um dementia so</p><p>if insulin does all these wonderful</p><p>things</p><p>even as an</p><p>um antioxidant why is it considered so</p><p>bad well it&rsquo;s because when you increase</p><p>the insulin you develop</p><p>insulin resistance and that&rsquo;s really the</p><p>missing understanding of this insulin</p><p>resistance Factor where the receptors</p><p>are actually the brain of this whole</p><p>thing and you start blocking The</p><p>receptors you&rsquo;re not getting</p><p>insulin and despite how much you have so</p><p>the more you have the more resistance</p><p>because of this mechanism this feedback</p><p>loop the thermostat is set at exactly at</p><p>70 degrees</p><p>so now what happens is the this</p><p>condition is all those symptoms of this</p><p>terrible condition is really because you</p><p>can&rsquo;t absorb it there&rsquo;s not enough in</p><p>the cell so here you&rsquo;re starving of</p><p>insulin yet you have all this insulin in</p><p>the rest of the body that can&rsquo;t be</p><p>utilized</p><p>um so it&rsquo;s a really interesting</p><p>topic and when you watch the video that</p><p>I released on this</p><p>boy everything will make sense</p><p>everything will make sense all right</p><p>very good Natalie this is an oft asked</p><p>question what&rsquo;s the best time to take</p><p>supplements during omad</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to actually produce another</p><p>video on this because um</p><p>with omad you&rsquo;re not eating right so do</p><p>you eat with meals well you&rsquo;re not</p><p>you&rsquo;re just eat them on an empty stomach</p><p>and you&rsquo;re like well am I going to get</p><p>the full absorption maybe not 100 with</p><p>some of the fat soluble ones but you&rsquo;ll</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get enough</p><p>um you know the only thing I would</p><p>recommend if you&rsquo;re doing the</p><p>electrolyte powder</p><p>um probably don&rsquo;t take that in the later</p><p>part of the day because it can act as a</p><p>you know a fluid release situation and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll be up you&rsquo;re up at night</p><p>urinating too much so take that in the</p><p>early part of the day and then the other</p><p>ones just take when it&rsquo;s convenient</p><p>because</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have food this is one of the</p><p>reasons why quite a few of my products</p><p>have contained in there</p><p>um like coconut oil or MCT oil to</p><p>actually</p><p>help the absorption of this vitamin D or</p><p>K2 and I have some other other ones as</p><p>well so you can do it when you&rsquo;re</p><p>fasting</p><p>all right very good so here&rsquo;s sort of</p><p>off in The Fringe question I like pit</p><p>Muller from YouTube is his handle is</p><p>mozzarella from Buffalo&rsquo;s better for you</p><p>than standard forms of mozzarella</p><p>you know I think it really would depend</p><p>on</p><p>you with the cheese you really have to</p><p>find out</p><p>um where it&rsquo;s produced uh it&rsquo;s there are</p><p>companies in America that produce decent</p><p>trees but</p><p>hands down Europe it has the best cheese</p><p>um in different parts of the world so</p><p>and they do raw and so you really have</p><p>to there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some amazing</p><p>um</p><p>traditional authentic ways of producing</p><p>cheese that have been kept standard for</p><p>for</p><p>hundreds of years</p><p>um but in America we do shortcuts with</p><p>the the parmesan cheese and and I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know about uh Buffalo mozzarella at all</p><p>but I do know there&rsquo;s different parts of</p><p>like Italy and France that just focus on</p><p>this one type of cheese and when I did</p><p>the tours I was just so thoroughly</p><p>impressed with how they do it and the</p><p>quality and the pride that they take so</p><p>the best thing is to you know be able to</p><p>find that some transparency which is not</p><p>really</p><p>easy to find like even if you eat</p><p>if you want to buy some chicken for</p><p>example wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the farm</p><p>actually had videos of their farm so you</p><p>can see their chickens there are certain</p><p>companies this might be hard to believe</p><p>that don&rsquo;t want you to see how they</p><p>raise these chickens I know that&rsquo;s hard</p><p>to believe but you can&rsquo;t see what they</p><p>do and you probably don&rsquo;t want to see</p><p>but um I&rsquo;m definitely um</p><p>uh just like um you know promoting</p><p>Farmers that do a good job and they um</p><p>we want to support those those people to</p><p>because they&rsquo;re doing the hard work and</p><p>they really care about the animals so</p><p>that&rsquo;s really important oh that&rsquo;s</p><p>terrific okay</p><p>botama or botama from Facebook I have</p><p>fibroids that bleed a lot I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>taking your supplements but they have</p><p>moved from my uterus to my cervix poor</p><p>thing help</p><p>well they&rsquo;re on their way out right you</p><p>want um to actually</p><p>um help reduce</p><p>those problems I would recommend</p><p>increasing not only cruciferous but a</p><p>product called dim which is a</p><p>concentrated</p><p>cruciferous product that can help you</p><p>sulforaphane is in the broccoli Sprouts</p><p>microgreens are really good for that</p><p>condition and then just make sure that</p><p>you want to avoid anything that could</p><p>stir up the growth of that those issues</p><p>so um avoid Dairy okay the cheese that I</p><p>just talked about that I just</p><p>recommended and then also any soy</p><p>products of course you&rsquo;re not doing soy</p><p>if you&rsquo;re on my program and then doing a</p><p>periodic prolonged fasting</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would do okay very good</p><p>well another gentleman Jason from Tampa</p><p>Florida he and I were sort of examining</p><p>each other in the green room and decided</p><p>that both of us were Model handsome and</p><p>as evidence of that we&rsquo;re going to bring</p><p>them up right now look at uh Jason</p><p>uh live around the world Jason go here</p><p>with your one question for Dr bird</p><p>absolutely uh yes</p><p>absolutely great by the way on a four to</p><p>five hour feeding window</p><p>um considering narrowing it even more uh</p><p>but it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s just a lot of</p><p>conflicting information so I want to see</p><p>if I can clarify some of that</p><p>um first of all I realized that I was</p><p>breaking my fast a little bit with these</p><p>little true lemon packets I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>if you can see them uh but yeah it</p><p>contains like a small amount of cane</p><p>sugar I just didn&rsquo;t even realize I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been using them for so long only three</p><p>grams but still</p><p>um so it&rsquo;s about 10 calories and I was</p><p>accidentally breaking fast but you know</p><p>I&rsquo;m just kind of wondering like first of</p><p>all is how much does that really matter</p><p>I hear David Sinclair always talking</p><p>about like oh I&rsquo;m snacking on nuts while</p><p>I&rsquo;m fasting so I&rsquo;m like well I don&rsquo;t get</p><p>that but</p><p>um you know overall my goal is you know</p><p>I want to continue to build muscle in</p><p>the gym</p><p>um you know that&rsquo;s important for me but</p><p>you know more important is obviously to</p><p>prioritize My Health and Longevity like</p><p>if it&rsquo;s smaller muscles and I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>live longer and be healthier I&rsquo;m cool</p><p>with that</p><p>um so I think omad&rsquo;s good but it&rsquo;s just</p><p>hard because any trainer nutritionist</p><p>the people I train with are like as soon</p><p>as you get home like pound a bunch of</p><p>food you know eat protein but I&rsquo;m</p><p>working out at 6 a.m and I&rsquo;m feeling</p><p>great all day not breaking fast until 3</p><p>4 P.M sometimes</p><p>um so but then I&rsquo;m practically in one</p><p>sitting consuming all my calories all my</p><p>protein all my supplements you know 2</p><p>000 calories and fatty foods and it&rsquo;s my</p><p>body really able to process all this</p><p>kind of like what you were saying</p><p>earlier in the show about like am I</p><p>absorbing these supplements you know</p><p>well in that fashion or do you think I</p><p>need to maybe adjust my feeding schedule</p><p>somewhat or or is this case is omad not</p><p>best for me just any opinion you have</p><p>would be great yeah I think you&rsquo;re kind</p><p>of in my boat too because I um I</p><p>definitely need to get the calories up</p><p>to prevent the weight loss and I&rsquo;d like</p><p>to do the long fasting I like to do one</p><p>meal a day but it&rsquo;s really hard to</p><p>consume you know 3 000 calories in one</p><p>meal or 3 500 calories so one thing you</p><p>might want to do is there&rsquo;s two things</p><p>that typically don&rsquo;t increase insulin as</p><p>much as other things and that would be</p><p>fat and fiber and they&rsquo;re both um so so</p><p>let&rsquo;s say for example</p><p>you do</p><p>um you eat at six whatever or let&rsquo;s say</p><p>you eat at five</p><p>and you have a lot of your protein your</p><p>fat and then maybe wait an hour</p><p>maybe even two and then do your huge</p><p>salad with the olive oil so that&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of what I do so it&rsquo;s kind of like a one</p><p>and a half meal a day that I can because</p><p>I I just can&rsquo;t do</p><p>10 cups of salad and all the protein and</p><p>all the fat in one meal I just can&rsquo;t do</p><p>that</p><p>um so some people can do that because</p><p>they have a super strong stomach and</p><p>digestive system but I kind of break it</p><p>down so I&rsquo;m almost doing one meal a day</p><p>but</p><p>with minimal damage because of the uh</p><p>there&rsquo;s no spike in uh I mean hardly any</p><p>with her salad you know you&rsquo;re not going</p><p>to spike that and then of course you&rsquo;re</p><p>working out so you want to hit the um</p><p>the volume and the uh intensity</p><p>um pretty hard to keep the muscles in</p><p>check but then really make sure that</p><p>your um your recovery time is good there</p><p>is some this DNA testing is fascinating</p><p>as I&rsquo;m getting into it they even have</p><p>reports on</p><p>exercise based on your DNA which I I</p><p>kind of like it but you can indirectly</p><p>find out what your pattern is just by</p><p>trying different things so for example</p><p>um I do very well with high intensity</p><p>power exercise but not with endurance so</p><p>if I go too long with my hit workouts</p><p>I have so much inflammation that could</p><p>last for for way too long so with you</p><p>you might just want to try different</p><p>things and see what works good and so</p><p>you want to work out to the point where</p><p>you do get sore the next day so your</p><p>muscles are actively growing in that</p><p>recovery phase</p><p>um and then just focus on the quality of</p><p>those those calories but I guess since</p><p>you&rsquo;re dealing with um muscle</p><p>preservation uh and also trying to get</p><p>as much health as possible I would do</p><p>like a one and a half uh meal a day</p><p>okay and were these true lemon packets</p><p>breaking my fast to some degree I I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s much better to just get just</p><p>get lemon juice or a lemon because yeah</p><p>um I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p><p>like any sugar</p><p>um even if it&rsquo;s three grams but I mean I</p><p>could see a like a half of a gram a half</p><p>of a gram you know that&rsquo;s right you were</p><p>talking now we&rsquo;re talking with a real</p><p>insignificant and this would be part of</p><p>the meal not during fasting but when you</p><p>do fasting and you have sugar</p><p>um I I don&rsquo;t like that because because</p><p>what knocks you out of the benefit of</p><p>like autophagy is insulin so now we&rsquo;re</p><p>raising insulin to some degree</p><p>um it&rsquo;s not large but it&rsquo;s still why why</p><p>even mess around if you don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>yep makes sense okay that&rsquo;s terrific now</p><p>back to our who&rsquo;s more handsome contest</p><p>between me and Jason he&rsquo;s younger but I</p><p>have better lighting so I think that uh</p><p>that knocks him out uh knocks him out of</p><p>the park okay thanks for coming on uh</p><p>Jason love to hear back from you uh with</p><p>all your great</p><p>um</p><p>you know</p><p>forward moving in your health so let&rsquo;s</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see what we have here I think</p><p>we asked another</p><p>question did I not bring the next</p><p>question up maybe I didn&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s look</p><p>here uh try that one doc true false sir</p><p>yeah this is a new question okay so true</p><p>or false a potassium deficiency can</p><p>trigger diabetes</p><p>is it true or false</p><p>all right folks dig into that and let&rsquo;s</p><p>go back to social media</p><p>John from YouTube do you have</p><p>recommendations for supplements and diet</p><p>to address early stage prostate cancer</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry John</p><p>well um the best most powerful thing you</p><p>could do right now is to start doing</p><p>fasting</p><p>start doing fasting immediately</p><p>um there&rsquo;s a lot out there other things</p><p>to do there&rsquo;s a protocol if you watch my</p><p>latest video there&rsquo;s a protocol</p><p>nutritional products I do not sell any</p><p>of those you could but we we&rsquo;ve done</p><p>studies I&rsquo;ve actually participated in</p><p>sponsored a study in Europe and with</p><p>huge success with this protocol and I</p><p>explained why it would help you but the</p><p>periodic fasting prolonged fasting is</p><p>going to be the most potent thing that</p><p>you can do</p><p>um with this</p><p>um</p><p>so there&rsquo;s one more little factor I want</p><p>to bring up regarding the cancer there</p><p>are people who get rid of their cancer</p><p>and all of a sudden it comes back and</p><p>then they always ask them well what did</p><p>you change oh I didn&rsquo;t change any of my</p><p>diet it&rsquo;s the same thing</p><p>um I said have you been through any</p><p>stress and then boom yes massive stress</p><p>so the stress will definitely can</p><p>reactivate certain types of cancer</p><p>because what it does to the immune</p><p>system so an another another important</p><p>lesson is to learn from other people</p><p>having problems so you can avoid that</p><p>and really work on your um stress factor</p><p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific okay let&rsquo;s go</p><p>to uh Beth from Facebook which k2d3 uh</p><p>do you recommend I can imagine can K2</p><p>create blood clots</p><p>no no K2 doesn&rsquo;t create blood clots</p><p>um</p><p>uh K1 does it doesn&rsquo;t create blood clots</p><p>it just there&rsquo;s you know people are like</p><p>thinking well well if K1 clots then I</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to get clots so I won&rsquo;t eat</p><p>no no it&rsquo;s going to get to a certain</p><p>point it&rsquo;s going to give you normal</p><p>clotting because you don&rsquo;t want to bleed</p><p>internally if you have a damaged organ</p><p>something like that so K1 is like really</p><p>important as a survival mechanism K2 has</p><p>everything to do with um</p><p>channeling calcium</p><p>but you can also get a lot of energy</p><p>from K2 as well because it helps the</p><p>mitochondria</p><p>um</p><p>so I think I answered that there might</p><p>have been more to that question but um</p><p>all right very good well here&rsquo;s an</p><p>important uh announcement this is from</p><p>Romania Cipher from Romania on YouTube</p><p>our national food is garlic apparently</p><p>it keeps the vampires away and you know</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of any vampire activity</p><p>in Romania at all today so you may have</p><p>a point there so thank you cypher he</p><p>might have something there yeah so</p><p>that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see uh Rosalinda</p><p>from YouTube can I drink hibiscus tea</p><p>while on high blood pressure meds</p><p>I think I think it probably would help</p><p>you because uh hibiscus tea actually can</p><p>help lower your blood sugars which could</p><p>be triggering your</p><p>um high blood pressure</p><p>so you should check that out okay very</p><p>good how far John from Facebook please</p><p>do more videos on treating high</p><p>cholesterol which supplements would you</p><p>recommend to treat it assuming you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have videos on that well I I do</p><p>um I am releasing more videos on the</p><p>topic you really need to do an advanced</p><p>lipid profile to look at the particle</p><p>size okay and you&rsquo;ll see two different</p><p>particle sizes you&rsquo;ll see one which is a</p><p>small dense SD LDL and then you&rsquo;ll see</p><p>another one</p><p>um large buoyant lb LDL and the one that</p><p>you want more of is the large buoyant</p><p>LDL the small dense one um has</p><p>everything to do with your carbohydrate</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing too too much carb and</p><p>refined sugars and things like that but</p><p>if you do keto</p><p>think about this you&rsquo;re mobilizing a lot</p><p>of cholesterol</p><p>this lipo</p><p>protein is there to transport this fat</p><p>and so you know there&rsquo;s a lot of false</p><p>information in this area that uh but I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to try to really clarify in this</p><p>video which I think you&rsquo;re going to like</p><p>because it&rsquo;s another one of those uh</p><p>things that everyone knows for a fact</p><p>but then</p><p>hmm there&rsquo;s uh actually not much data to</p><p>show that it&rsquo;s true</p><p>very good let&rsquo;s see uh this is another</p><p>question that&rsquo;s frequently Asked Rhonda</p><p>from YouTube my gallbladder has been</p><p>ripped out she said removed do I need</p><p>bile salts and your gallbladder formula</p><p>and if so how much</p><p>yeah in addition you need to get in</p><p>another gallbladder you can get them in</p><p>various places they come in different</p><p>materials and I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic</p><p>yeah you want to get um</p><p>a good product that can help support the</p><p>bile that you&rsquo;re missing now how do you</p><p>know you that you took too much well if</p><p>you get</p><p>um</p><p>diarrhea okay that would be indication</p><p>that you don&rsquo;t need any more bile okay</p><p>um how do you know if you need more</p><p>well constipation would tell you if you</p><p>have constipation you need more bile</p><p>salts so that&rsquo;s just a real simple thing</p><p>to kind of determine</p><p>um maybe the dosage or or if you need it</p><p>or not some people have</p><p>um even after surgery they have a nice</p><p>drainage and they have enough</p><p>um but there&rsquo;s a good portion of people</p><p>that don&rsquo;t have enough because they</p><p>don&rsquo;t have that concentration</p><p>unfortunately</p><p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see quiz question</p><p>number two and by the way viewers wanted</p><p>to know what was the specific answer to</p><p>quiz question number one true or false</p><p>and I erased them as I go by so I don&rsquo;t</p><p>even remember what it was do you recall</p><p>what the first question was</p><p>well I think Jason remembers</p><p>um</p><p>do you remember the first question Jason</p><p>um</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember</p><p>all right uh I I think it has to do with</p><p>um</p><p>can a potassium deficiency</p><p>cause diabetes</p><p>we never answered that did we Steve well</p><p>I&rsquo;m ashamed if we didn&rsquo;t I remember</p><p>giving out the answer to number one</p><p>let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;m going to scroll back here</p><p>uh and there should be some little music</p><p>in the background ding dong ding dong</p><p>anyway it did we did 55 said it was true</p><p>and 45 said it was false so at least we</p><p>got answers and we did announce that and</p><p>I remember you chatting about it so uh</p><p>Carrie would you please type that back</p><p>in if you recall it I promise not to</p><p>erase these things as I go along in the</p><p>future but okay so so let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s</p><p>just cover it again okay if we if we</p><p>if we did it already then then it&rsquo;s</p><p>really we&rsquo;re gonna give you more</p><p>information about this but potassium</p><p>um I don&rsquo;t think we covered it but um</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing with potassium</p><p>um</p><p>potassium is needed</p><p>to um protect your kidneys and also</p><p>potassium is intimately involved in the</p><p>storage of the glucose</p><p>but</p><p>a really big cause of diabetes is when</p><p>someone gets on these thiazide diuretics</p><p>all of a sudden they have this um to get</p><p>this diabetes</p><p>but when you take the ACE inhibitors</p><p>sometimes you actually</p><p>um it&rsquo;s protective against diabetes so</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting so why is that what&rsquo;s</p><p>the difference between those two</p><p>medications for blood pressure one uh</p><p>creates a the thighs that creates a</p><p>deficiency of potassium</p><p>and the other one increases the</p><p>potassium retention</p><p>so</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting and potassium has a</p><p>huge effect on insulin so if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have enough potassium you can&rsquo;t generate</p><p>enough insulin so if you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>enough insulin guess what you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to have a lot of blood sugar going on so</p><p>that&rsquo;s diabetes</p><p>so it&rsquo;s really really</p><p>um interesting to look at this from that</p><p>point of view because</p><p>wow if that&rsquo;s true then why don&rsquo;t you</p><p>just take some potassium for your</p><p>diabetes and see what happens or or your</p><p>blood pressure and see what happens and</p><p>I do find a lot of people get rid of</p><p>their blood pressure I mean if you&rsquo;re</p><p>taking a medication like ACE inhibitors</p><p>and the primary mode of function is just</p><p>helping with potassium I like bypass the</p><p>medication and take the potassium and</p><p>see what happens</p><p>I mean just I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just me</p><p>but it just sounds very logical</p><p>um but um yeah so it is true when you&rsquo;re</p><p>low in potassium you can generate um</p><p>um more glucose in the blood because you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have that that insulin to control</p><p>it anymore unfortunately okay very good</p><p>well by the way I&rsquo;m back on track so</p><p>that was quiz question number two and 90</p><p>say it&rsquo;s true and ten percent say it&rsquo;s</p><p>false uh and even though Jason was of</p><p>literally no help at all I discovered</p><p>that I I have the email and here&rsquo;s the</p><p>first question true false or high blood</p><p>insulin hyperinsulimia if I said that</p><p>right is really a condition of insulin</p><p>deficiency yeah</p><p>yeah we covered and I covered that yeah</p><p>I think I covered that</p><p>um</p><p>and that is uh when you have that</p><p>remember I talked about like um it has</p><p>everything to do with um the receptor</p><p>being the brain and that really controls</p><p>the amount of insulin that&rsquo;s penetrates</p><p>into the body</p><p>so um when you get this high level of</p><p>insulin the blood you&rsquo;re really creating</p><p>a deficiency because you&rsquo;re creating</p><p>this resistance</p><p>so that is</p><p>the problem it&rsquo;s kind of like um</p><p>let&rsquo;s say you want to get married right</p><p>and um you want to get your message</p><p>across to your future spouse right and</p><p>you start yelling at her and you&rsquo;re</p><p>really getting your message across but</p><p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re creating resistance on the</p><p>other side</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to end up getting</p><p>married because she&rsquo;s going to think</p><p>you&rsquo;re very weird so I guess that would</p><p>be a kind of a weird analogy to what I</p><p>just said okay Bachelors keep that in</p><p>mind here&rsquo;s the next question</p><p>all right what is the most common</p><p>symptom of a pancreatic enzyme</p><p>deficiency</p><p>okay and we promised to keep track of</p><p>that question</p><p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to the green</p><p>room and in this case we&rsquo;ve got a repeat</p><p>customer Jesse from Worcester if I said</p><p>that right I&rsquo;m very proud when I get</p><p>that weird Town name right uh did I say</p><p>it right Jesse</p><p>you did very good I think we can hear</p><p>you perfectly wow we came through</p><p>finally</p><p>all right um thanks for having me on</p><p>again</p><p>um so my question last last week was</p><p>about H pylori</p><p>um but not H by Lori directly about</p><p>three and a half years ago I started</p><p>waking up with little headaches and I</p><p>first I started getting a lot of GERD</p><p>symptoms burping very gassy</p><p>um and then I started having stomach</p><p>pains and then I started waking up with</p><p>headaches</p><p>um and then I coughed up blood and then</p><p>tested for h pylori so then then it</p><p>turned into</p><p>um waking up gasping choking and then I</p><p>tested positive for sleep apnea I was</p><p>about 215 pounds and in very good shape</p><p>then and then</p><p>um I ended up uh</p><p>um suffering with that with the Sleep</p><p>issue ever since</p><p>um and my weight has fluctuated and I</p><p>also tested for dysbiosis recently</p><p>um and I got reinfected with H pylori</p><p>after eradicating it and I still have</p><p>sleep issues now I I use a CPAP</p><p>um so my question was I never had sleep</p><p>issues until I got H pylori</p><p>um waking up tired exhausted I know I</p><p>have gastritis now</p><p>um and like I said I had dysbiosis on a</p><p>very high level</p><p>um</p><p>so the question I guess would be</p><p>can</p><p>can H pylori induce some sort of sleep</p><p>apnea</p><p>um yeah yeah the connection with that is</p><p>because there&rsquo;s two common symptoms of a</p><p>B12 deficiency weakness and also</p><p>difficulty breathing which could</p><p>definitely be sleep apnea for sure and</p><p>what is the relationship between the</p><p>stomach can be 12 well it&rsquo;s huge if you</p><p>have H pylori we know the pH is not</p><p>right in your stomach and we also know</p><p>that you&rsquo;re probably having a heck of a</p><p>Time absorbing B12</p><p>which can then also throw off your whole</p><p>gut there&rsquo;s a huge connection with that</p><p>because B12 actually helps the diversity</p><p>of these microbes they actually feed</p><p>they actually eat B12 too so um I think</p><p>a good solution for you to start to take</p><p>um not just work on the stomach but take</p><p>methylcobolamine the um a better form of</p><p>a natural form of B12 that can help you</p><p>restore your breathing</p><p>um because it&rsquo;s it controls the nervous</p><p>system and the brain and uh the the also</p><p>the respiratory centers in the brain</p><p>so I think that&rsquo;ll actually as you&rsquo;ll</p><p>start breathing better and you may like</p><p>many other people</p><p>you know might have some genetic uh</p><p>variation that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to</p><p>absorb B12 so I think that would be</p><p>something that I would I would try</p><p>without any testing because</p><p>it&rsquo;s inexpensive and you can just see</p><p>really quickly if that doesn&rsquo;t solve it</p><p>and of course yeah you can then add a</p><p>probiotic and things like that but what</p><p>happens with this H pylori is a little</p><p>sneaky guy it tends to increase the</p><p>ammonia levels and ammonia is very very</p><p>alkaline so it&rsquo;s gonna to survive it</p><p>starts to really mess up your pH of your</p><p>stomach to go up very high and so now</p><p>you&rsquo;re like have a hard time digesting</p><p>and that can create all sorts of issues</p><p>down chain from in the small intestine</p><p>the large intestine so um you know</p><p>definitely if you can take betaine</p><p>hydrochloride do it because we want to</p><p>acidify the stomach so we can get rid of</p><p>that and also sulforaphane as the from</p><p>the micro greens might be very helpful</p><p>as well</p><p>to broccoli broccoli micro greens okay</p><p>all right</p><p>go ahead Jesse just one more we&rsquo;re</p><p>running a little bit of time but quickly</p><p>so treating all of that stuff you think</p><p>could keep because when I do lay down</p><p>and I go to sleep the CPAP seems to help</p><p>on some days and I&rsquo;ve noticed recently</p><p>that I started introducing aloe vera</p><p>that has helped somewhat like lower the</p><p>uh</p><p>um the amount of apnea is per hour uh</p><p>but</p><p>like I said I never had any breathing or</p><p>sleeping issues before having H pylori</p><p>now it&rsquo;s been a nightmare for two and a</p><p>half years but I had a little remission</p><p>when I went on a pretty alkaline uh</p><p>plant-based diet for about a month</p><p>um but then I got that&rsquo;s when I got</p><p>Ridge I got uh</p><p>uh H pylori again because I got food</p><p>poisoning in a foreign country yeah see</p><p>it&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>um without the right pH of your stomach</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to tolerate</p><p>um animal meat very well</p><p>so naturally you know you do more</p><p>plant-based but then the problem is it</p><p>it makes things more alkaline and now we</p><p>don&rsquo;t have that acidic stomach to kill</p><p>off the microbes to keep everything in</p><p>check</p><p>um so it&rsquo;s a really um Balancing Act uh</p><p>between the two you might want to have a</p><p>little bit of Animal product with the</p><p>betaine hydrochloride like a lot of it</p><p>like maybe even nine tablets and then</p><p>um do some of the other things to</p><p>restore</p><p>um</p><p>the balance but uh I guess it&rsquo;s one of</p><p>those things you&rsquo;re going to have to try</p><p>something and see if it doesn&rsquo;t work</p><p>because there&rsquo;s so many other factors</p><p>involved great okay listen Jesse thanks</p><p>so much and keep keep us posted on your</p><p>progress I&rsquo;ve been a little behind on</p><p>the questions but the audience has</p><p>picked it up for us so the third</p><p>question is what&rsquo;s the most common</p><p>symptom of pancreatic enzyme deficiency</p><p>and 68 of our respondents say burping or</p><p>excessive gas 22 say pain or fatigue and</p><p>ten percent say heartburn or</p><p>constipation so doc do we have any</p><p>winners today well all of you are</p><p>correct</p><p>um but it&rsquo;s basically undigested uh</p><p>usually you see unadjusted fat in the</p><p>stool Seattle Rhea it&rsquo;s called and you</p><p>have this um stool that floats and it</p><p>has a very bad odor</p><p>um because what happens is like you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have those enzymes to break down</p><p>the fats so we have all this undigested</p><p>fat that kind of goes down there it just</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t get digested so it creates a lot</p><p>of problems you see that with</p><p>pancreatitis you see that with a lot of</p><p>pancreatic issues but I&rsquo;m going to do a</p><p>complete video on that so you get</p><p>the full knowledge of what happens in</p><p>the stomach if you don&rsquo;t have the enzyme</p><p>like uh pepsin pepsin and then also</p><p>the large intestine the small intestine</p><p>too we&rsquo;ll talk about that all right very</p><p>good here&rsquo;s the next question then we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to Mary and Huntington Beach so uh</p><p>there it is Doc</p><p>okay why would you not want to consume</p><p>salad or vegetables when you have sibo</p><p>small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p><p>all right climb on that and Mary I&rsquo;m</p><p>glad we got you back you said it</p><p>disappeared for a while but here you are</p><p>on with Dr Berg if you&rsquo;re unmuted go</p><p>ahead with your question</p><p>hear me we can yes perfectly oh okay</p><p>yeah I had internet issues all of a</p><p>sudden so I got you back all right</p><p>um good morning Dr Berg I&rsquo;m honored to</p><p>meet you today thank you so much for</p><p>sharing your Stellar information to me</p><p>and all the millions of people in this</p><p>world to take control of our health</p><p>thank you so much okay welcome yeah I&rsquo;m</p><p>so honored to meet you okay um let&rsquo;s see</p><p>I just want to say that uh</p><p>where I wrote this down Okay</p><p>um</p><p>okay the first thing I learned from when</p><p>I found you about two and a half years</p><p>ago just thankfully think right before</p><p>covid</p><p>and the first thing that I learned was</p><p>that the health concerns for um</p><p>long term taking long-term medications</p><p>okay so you know you go to the doctor</p><p>you take what you need to take and but</p><p>it&rsquo;s the long term okay so first thing I</p><p>did because I was on 10 years of anti uh</p><p>antidepressants</p><p>so the first thing I did was sorry I</p><p>started weeding myself off</p><p>uh watched your videos I started Keto</p><p>omed</p><p>um apple cider vinegar and if and so</p><p>uh what happened is that after I weaned</p><p>myself off I got so much energy now I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been walking you know I got no brain fog</p><p>no depression</p><p>um I didn&rsquo;t know I was a zombie for 10</p><p>years I really didn&rsquo;t know that so I</p><p>only take you supplements now and uh</p><p>because I&rsquo;m 70 and proud to say that I T</p><p>I don&rsquo;t take any medications wow so yeah</p><p>and um so yeah thank you so much for</p><p>that</p><p>um uh I want to mention uh</p><p>into a December 2020 I got exposed to</p><p>covid I I couldn&rsquo;t get uh tested but I</p><p>had symptoms of uh for over a year and a</p><p>half I couldn&rsquo;t smell</p><p>well I</p><p>it tastes and smell so I took your sinus</p><p>supplement</p><p>one bottle and I got 85 to 90 percent of</p><p>my smell back so</p><p>I I wanted to try anything and I know I</p><p>want there&rsquo;s another video on um uh</p><p>concerning sinus okay so and by the way</p><p>Mary I&rsquo;m sorry we&rsquo;re kind of running out</p><p>of time if you have a specific question</p><p>if you can hit us with it real quickly</p><p>I&rsquo;m getting to my question okay so I&rsquo;m</p><p>basically healthy but the one thing I</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything gelatin collagen</p><p>silica uh my nails are so thin paper</p><p>thin</p><p>okay okay so let&rsquo;s cover that and uh</p><p>well done and all these other things I</p><p>mean you have to be nowadays you have to</p><p>be really super healthy to be able to</p><p>handle medications take medications</p><p>nowadays</p><p>um because of all the side effects like</p><p>fatigue and you didn&rsquo;t even know until</p><p>you came off of it</p><p>um so um for the nails I think the</p><p>probably the the best thing that I would</p><p>recommend to take would be um</p><p>silica</p><p>in a liquid and then of course you can</p><p>also do other things like biotin</p><p>especially if there&rsquo;s any gut problem</p><p>too that could be blocking your ability</p><p>to use biotin biotin strengthens the</p><p>fingers and nails and and of course the</p><p>trace trace minerals will do it as well</p><p>but silica is a good one let&rsquo;s say you</p><p>do that and it doesn&rsquo;t work which should</p><p>be very rare I would just do more trace</p><p>minerals at this point because the fresh</p><p>measures are the cofactors that allow</p><p>proteins to be formed especially</p><p>collagen and other proteins and so</p><p>but some people um</p><p>they have issues with absorbing those</p><p>minerals so they need more so I would</p><p>just take more of the trace minerals and</p><p>that should help you but that would be</p><p>after the silica</p><p>okay well listen uh Mary I tell you what</p><p>we&rsquo;re so short on time I wish we could</p><p>spend more time with you but we can&rsquo;t</p><p>but we&rsquo;re glad we were able to get you</p><p>back on so maybe come back with us at a</p><p>later date and we will uh address your</p><p>question at that point now we have</p><p>um</p><p>sorry to do that but there we go we have</p><p>uh answers to the next question and it</p><p>asks what is the most common symptom of</p><p>pancreatic enzymes deficiency and the</p><p>audience quickly answered</p><p>ninety percent of them said respondents</p><p>say the fiber actually feeds the sibo or</p><p>candida 10 say it&rsquo;s because the attached</p><p>nutrients cannot be absorbed</p><p>now um</p><p>so that question</p><p>I think we oh I&rsquo;m sorry forgive me</p><p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the correct question see I</p><p>was scared to erase it because I got in</p><p>trouble before why would you not want to</p><p>consume salad or veggies if you have</p><p>sibo which is small intestinal bacterial</p><p>overgrowth the answer still makes sense</p><p>so 90 say fiber actually feeds the sibo</p><p>and 10 say it&rsquo;s because the attached</p><p>nutrients can&rsquo;t be absorbed so there we</p><p>go sorry audience</p><p>yeah so yeah so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s absolutely</p><p>true because you can&rsquo;t um</p><p>you have bacteria that in the wrong</p><p>place it&rsquo;s in the small intestines so</p><p>it&rsquo;s competing it is competing for um</p><p>nutrients</p><p>so if you add</p><p>this food for them they&rsquo;re gonna go oh</p><p>thank you we can eat this and they&rsquo;re</p><p>going to start fermenting fermenting is</p><p>not meant to occur in the small</p><p>intestine just the large so now we have</p><p>fermentation in the wrong place and</p><p>guess what you&rsquo;re going to feel</p><p>I mean the the small intestine is not as</p><p>big as the large intestine so you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to get so much pain and bloating</p><p>when you do salads</p><p>um and fiber that especially like these</p><p>synthetic fibers you&rsquo;re just gonna and</p><p>even like some of the sugar alcohols</p><p>um that totally have different fibers in</p><p>it that are synthetic boy it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>rip up your your colon and make you feel</p><p>terrible and here you are thinking wow</p><p>I&rsquo;m eating healthy I&rsquo;m eating low carb</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing salads</p><p>and I&rsquo;m like why do I feel so bad it&rsquo;s</p><p>because you you have sibo and and you</p><p>need to kind of cut that out for a while</p><p>like to even do carnivore for a couple</p><p>months because um you have bacteria in</p><p>the wrong place but I will release a</p><p>video more comprehensively on how to</p><p>explain why you get it and how to</p><p>resolve it in more detail this next week</p><p>all right good well Terry said one more</p><p>screw up on the questions and I&rsquo;m fired</p><p>so I&rsquo;m going to keep that in mind uh</p><p>however we do have room for one more uh</p><p>question this one is from YouTube for</p><p>the past week my urine has been very</p><p>orange not dark yellow but orange not</p><p>eating carrots at all dehydration or</p><p>liver issues</p><p>well possibly possibly you know I mean</p><p>um are you doing any type of vitamins</p><p>especially the B vitamins that can give</p><p>more of a yellow but sometimes an orange</p><p>um but uh yeah it could be definitely</p><p>liver you know when you try to like</p><p>figure out these problems with just one</p><p>symptom it&rsquo;s really hard because you</p><p>need to you gotta need to know a little</p><p>bit more about what&rsquo;s going on to be</p><p>able to really give some good advice</p><p>um it&rsquo;s like me asking like okay I&rsquo;m</p><p>fatigued why am I fatigued well it could</p><p>be a thousand different reasons so</p><p>um orange urine</p><p>that&rsquo;s a good one that&rsquo;s the new one</p><p>you&rsquo;re very good well listen audience I</p><p>promise to be better behaved on the</p><p>questions next week that we&rsquo;re about out</p><p>of time so uh doc if you oh how about</p><p>this why don&rsquo;t we talk about the great</p><p>um advances we have in
