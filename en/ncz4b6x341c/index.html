<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone I</p>
<p>appreciate you stopping by to uh</p>
<p>interact with uh some of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about today and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of good questions lined up</p>
<p>and of course anything that I say is not</p>
<p>meant to replace any type of chemical</p>
<p>synthetic</p>
<p>you know drugs for something more</p>
<p>natural that has less side effects so</p>
<p>just check with your doctor before</p>
<p>making that substitution God forbid all</p>
<p>right Stephen</p>
<p>all right well we&rsquo;re really excited and</p>
<p>honored to have our first guest out of</p>
<p>the Green Room it&rsquo;s uh Julian and she is</p>
<p>one of the many hard-working hospice</p>
<p>nurses that does such a tough task and</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re glad to have her on hang on</p>
<p>just a moment Julian let me bring I mean</p>
<p>Carrie right I&rsquo;m sorry Harry yes stand</p>
<p>by Carrie and I&rsquo;ve really botched this</p>
<p>up because I didn&rsquo;t even unmute you so</p>
<p>Carrie stand by a minute and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to Fashion this shot for you including</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see Dr Berg forgive me for</p>
<p>doing that what did I do wrong</p>
<p>I tear it Carrie I&rsquo;m not quite sure</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with your shot but please</p>
<p>go ahead with your question for Dr Byrd</p>
<p>okay no blem hi Dr Berg hi hi I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following you for quite a while and um I</p>
<p>must say everything you talk about I</p>
<p>pretty much learned in college uh</p>
<p>genetics and molecular genetics so I</p>
<p>appreciate you</p>
<p>um I do have a question I um have</p>
<p>recently started menopause about oh</p>
<p>maybe six months ago</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve noticed that losing weight</p>
<p>feels</p>
<p>impossible</p>
<p>um in fact I&rsquo;ve tried everything I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried in the past</p>
<p>um cutting cutting calories cutting down</p>
<p>carbs fasting I mean I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve tried it</p>
<p>all and I can&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>um get the ball rolling and I wondered</p>
<p>if you had any advice for me</p>
<p>so do you um where do you tend to hold</p>
<p>the weight is it more in the stomach or</p>
<p>the hips or the butt what what where</p>
<p>does it tend to accumulate</p>
<p>stomach hips thighs that area</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>do you did you um have you been doing</p>
<p>keto before that before menopause or</p>
<p>just kind of like after menopause</p>
<p>I just recently started</p>
<p>um after watching you I started the</p>
<p>healthy keto I actually started the omad</p>
<p>um and I find that you know by the end</p>
<p>of the day I&rsquo;m starving</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s really hard to you know just</p>
<p>have a salad</p>
<p>so uh that tells me right there that</p>
<p>somehow I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re in ketosis</p>
<p>for some weird reason</p>
<p>um do you um can you give me a little</p>
<p>bit more information on like um what you</p>
<p>would eat and how how many meals a day</p>
<p>um well I&rsquo;ve been trying to do one meal</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been trying the sauerkraut uh</p>
<p>last night I had the sauerkraut I had</p>
<p>some hot dogs on it the night before I</p>
<p>had a hamburger with a big salad</p>
<p>um I just find that later in the night</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m craving sweets</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it might be from a habit that I used to</p>
<p>do I used to kind of snack into the</p>
<p>night but it just feels harder than it</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>yeah um here&rsquo;s the thing um did you go</p>
<p>right from multiple meals just to that</p>
<p>one meal a day</p>
<p>yeah okay and how long do you do it for</p>
<p>until you you said well this is a bit</p>
<p>too difficult</p>
<p>probably about four days</p>
<p>yeah and then I and then I tried a</p>
<p>prolonged fast I fasted for about four</p>
<p>days</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m kind of an all or none person</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;m not very patient so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>you know challenge myself as hard as I</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m feeling defeated right now</p>
<p>um and just</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to go</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna switch</p>
<p>your goal for a moment and um okay</p>
<p>the first goal let&rsquo;s just uh</p>
<p>have the first goal being getting rid of</p>
<p>the appetite</p>
<p>in other words get to a point where you</p>
<p>can do this and you&rsquo;re like wow I can go</p>
<p>long periods of time without an appetite</p>
<p>I have no more Cravings that is your</p>
<p>first goal because that is based on like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get healthy lose weight not lose</p>
<p>weight to get healthy</p>
<p>um and so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re really up</p>
<p>against uh probably years of insulin</p>
<p>resistance and so it&rsquo;s like even what</p>
<p>happens is like even though you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating sugar your liver</p>
<p>is uh in this excessive uh</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis it&rsquo;s making sugar from</p>
<p>other things and so here you are like</p>
<p>what is going on I shouldn&rsquo;t be going</p>
<p>through this</p>
<p>um and then so how do we do that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would do two meals a day and I would</p>
<p>add a little bit of a little bit more</p>
<p>fat with the meals yes that&rsquo;s right more</p>
<p>fat saturated fat I would add a little</p>
<p>maybe butter and I would add</p>
<p>um other things with with meat fat why</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um menopause you have this shift</p>
<p>from your ovaries that are gone in</p>
<p>retirement now to the adrenal glands</p>
<p>which are the raw materials cholesterol</p>
<p>we need to to build up more of those uh</p>
<p>hormones that your adrenals now have to</p>
<p>take over the slack</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll actually the extra Fat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help um with the satisfying you</p>
<p>allowing you to go longer without eating</p>
<p>and then I would give it probably two</p>
<p>three probably even four weeks to really</p>
<p>let your body</p>
<p>um adjust and um</p>
<p>adapt to fat burning then you go to one</p>
<p>meal a day</p>
<p>and then watch what happens and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like wow now my body&rsquo;s uh really in</p>
<p>ketosis and you could probably even get</p>
<p>a test to make sure you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>ketosis and then you can um you know add</p>
<p>add some exercise to that and it goes</p>
<p>stronger ketosis but I think just the</p>
<p>transition just needs to be tweaked a</p>
<p>little bit more and especially if you</p>
<p>had a history of doing this with sweets</p>
<p>um does that make sense</p>
<p>it does it just I lost a whole bunch of</p>
<p>weight about six years ago</p>
<p>just by cutting my calories and carbs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not working this time around</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah this happens with a lot of women</p>
<p>that goes go through menopause and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a whole different</p>
<p>um condition</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I think I think um the fact that you</p>
<p>still crave sweets and still hungry</p>
<p>tells me just you&rsquo;re not quite in</p>
<p>ketosis yet now why would that be well</p>
<p>because adrenals need some more support</p>
<p>and that needs to be focused on first so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um because I will tell you this the</p>
<p>results will come once you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in ketosis and how do we</p>
<p>know that well you have no you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry anymore</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of like yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome try that I think uh just shift</p>
<p>your focus and then Watch What Happens</p>
<p>and then one more Point</p>
<p>um some of the superficial factors</p>
<p>called subcutaneous fat which is</p>
<p>different than the visceral fat</p>
<p>um it works a little bit differently in</p>
<p>that you have to really add a lot more</p>
<p>exercise to this so of course don&rsquo;t omit</p>
<p>that as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific well uh Carey um I want</p>
<p>to come in here for a second because Dr</p>
<p>Berg will attest that I have one of the</p>
<p>weakest constitutions on the planet I</p>
<p>have calluses on my left hand from</p>
<p>hanging on the refrigerator door</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just awful and yeah I&rsquo;m not hungry</p>
<p>right now and I won&rsquo;t think of eating</p>
<p>until three o&rsquo;clock and my weak point is</p>
<p>Carrie uh you know in the evening I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more inclined once I eat something then</p>
<p>the engine begins a little bit and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hungry but I don&rsquo;t feel like food at all</p>
<p>right now but my Mantra is nothing after</p>
<p>60 nothing after six well I&rsquo;m hungry I</p>
<p>know so eat tomorrow have a blast you</p>
<p>know beat those great things nothing</p>
<p>after six and the weight falls off me</p>
<p>and then more importantly that once I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come to that discipline it&rsquo;s not hard</p>
<p>after a lifetime of freezer burn Lean</p>
<p>Cuisines and misery trying to lose</p>
<p>weight intermittent fasting in</p>
<p>particular is fantastic and I I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been the best</p>
<p>um you know keto guy but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>question the simple thing is don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>two cups of sugar a day Steve and I</p>
<p>guarantee you you&rsquo;ll feel better so low</p>
<p>carbs and I I may not meet the mark</p>
<p>exactly but low carbs and um</p>
<p>intermittent fasting one meal a day or</p>
<p>maybe two within a two hour three hour</p>
<p>window but but you know it&rsquo;s just a life</p>
<p>changer for me and I&rsquo;ve been down about</p>
<p>45 pounds for the last three years uh</p>
<p>thanks to Dr Berg&rsquo;s uh constant</p>
<p>discipline uh on me and saying you want</p>
<p>to stay on the show well you bet no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kidding but he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>he said I don&rsquo;t want any yeah anyway but</p>
<p>listen that&rsquo;s it so Carrie have faith</p>
<p>keep going and once you get that squared</p>
<p>away you are going to absolutely love</p>
<p>life uh on</p>
<p>um omad and and keto and so on so trust</p>
<p>the process all right Stephen being I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do a I&rsquo;ll release the video on</p>
<p>another a slightly related topic because</p>
<p>um as I&rsquo;m getting into the DNA testing</p>
<p>even my self like I have this there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of a sweet tooth Gene</p>
<p>that I have a problem with so I if I</p>
<p>start</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over I can&rsquo;t just do one it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I have to do the whole thing and um and</p>
<p>then keep going and keep going so as</p>
<p>long as I don&rsquo;t start and so I just I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t give in to things anymore</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have the Cravings but uh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I have a tendency to</p>
<p>uh overdo it big time and so um which is</p>
<p>very ironic because uh if you compare</p>
<p>back then to now it&rsquo;s like a whole</p>
<p>different person yeah well we are</p>
<p>Kindred souls in that in that regard</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s kick off an exciting question</p>
<p>oh wait a minute uh doc let me go to</p>
<p>something else because I didn&rsquo;t load</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really getting F today for uh</p>
<p>being ready for the show so let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Social Media Barber from YouTube please</p>
<p>discuss the importance of food</p>
<p>combination when eating what are the bad</p>
<p>combinations and what are the best</p>
<p>combinations if that makes sense</p>
<p>you know honestly it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>um with this you can combine any way you</p>
<p>want because we&rsquo;re not adding the grains</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s not about food</p>
<p>combining that&rsquo;s not the important</p>
<p>factor but if you wanted to know what</p>
<p>would be the worst combination would be</p>
<p>to add each sugar and protein or sugar</p>
<p>and fat together because you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get something called glycation which is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh the the kind of The Binding of this</p>
<p>protein and this uh making it very</p>
<p>unavailable to you and really creating</p>
<p>um going right into the Diabetic Type</p>
<p>Thing so and that creates a lot of</p>
<p>damage in all your tissues the arteries</p>
<p>the brain the eye it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>glycation so that would be the worst uh</p>
<p>so what combinations would that be let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see what has sugar and fat</p>
<p>ice cream</p>
<p>um which I used to have every night</p>
<p>before bed whole thing of Ben and</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s then what about um sugar and</p>
<p>protein barbecued ribs</p>
<p>so those are those are two things that</p>
<p>are really bad</p>
<p>um but you can actually add</p>
<p>vegetables or salad with with meat how</p>
<p>about that that&rsquo;s a good combination</p>
<p>and uh so as long as your carbs are low</p>
<p>you can do any combination you want all</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re all cued up with the</p>
<p>questions and here&rsquo;s the first one doc</p>
<p>okay which vegetable is highest in</p>
<p>quercetin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you read that I would know how</p>
<p>to pronounce it so the highest in</p>
<p>quercetin all right let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media uh Ingrid from Facebook I</p>
<p>lost 40 pounds on keto</p>
<p>thanks to all your advice question oh</p>
<p>that just jumped up let&rsquo;s see a question</p>
<p>because of our female hormones boy we</p>
<p>just talked about that should we come</p>
<p>off keto for a bit or just a day and</p>
<p>then get back on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this false information about you</p>
<p>should cycle through carbs like for some</p>
<p>reason like if you eat carbs then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reset something or it&rsquo;ll be beneficial</p>
<p>listen you&rsquo;ve already been doing that</p>
<p>probably your whole life and that has</p>
<p>not been successful I can&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>even one reason why you should cycle</p>
<p>through and go back to go back to carbs</p>
<p>I mean what just to fill up your</p>
<p>glycogen Reserve well what what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>going to do you you probably already</p>
<p>have enough glycogen</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you when you actually go on low</p>
<p>carb or even no carb you still your body</p>
<p>can still make sugar uh if it needs it</p>
<p>because certain a couple of tissues in</p>
<p>your body do need a little sugar but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to and you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>consume sugar to do that so you want</p>
<p>your body to make it and but there is no</p>
<p>reason other than some arbitrary made up</p>
<p>idea that we need to cycle through the</p>
<p>sugar for some</p>
<p>reason which is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>good thing</p>
<p>especially since you as soon as you</p>
<p>start that now you&rsquo;re like okay now you</p>
<p>next day your blood sugars are low and</p>
<p>like um I need some more so just a</p>
<p>little bit of something will create more</p>
<p>of that</p>
<p>that problem or more that desire okay</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s talk about who is watching</p>
<p>the show do we have any viewers we</p>
<p>certainly do so we&rsquo;d like to say good</p>
<p>morning to all our viewers joining us</p>

<p>uh Saudi Arabia of course and all across</p>
<p>these United States including Julian who</p>
<p>is one of our traveling sort of</p>
<p>minstrels of health and he&rsquo;s currently</p>
<p>in San Diego and we&rsquo;re glad to have him</p>
<p>back and Julian if you would give us a</p>
<p>30-second intro and then let Dr Berg dig</p>
<p>into it and Julian you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>hey nice to see you Dr Berg I appreciate</p>
<p>all the research you share and do I</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see I had a lot of questions</p>
<p>um recently I did everything you</p>
<p>mentioned about blood pressure</p>
<p>um I forgot the whole list but the</p>
<p>Arginine I was curious if I have to take</p>
<p>margin L-Arginine if I consume a lot of</p>
<p>meat and if um oh I stopped eating kale</p>
<p>uh that worked I think my blood pressure</p>
<p>came down I would eat a pound of kale</p>
<p>every time I eat but</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to do that the rest of</p>
<p>my life uh it&rsquo;s a very bloating</p>
<p>so I replaced it with a bunch of</p>
<p>avocados and cucumbers I was curious on</p>
<p>your thought on those two if that makes</p>
<p>sense okay yeah so I think I think yeah</p>
<p>I hear you it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ours you do have um not very majorly</p>
<p>high oxlets in kale but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other anti-nutrients that some people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t do well</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>um our L-Arginine does tend to increase</p>
<p>the nitric oxide which will help the</p>
<p>arteries and blood pressure and things</p>
<p>like that but</p>
<p>um like why couldn&rsquo;t you eat just a</p>
<p>steak why could you eat some Animal</p>
<p>product and get that Arginine because</p>
<p>that specific amino acid does compete</p>
<p>with other amino acids so it might not</p>
<p>be selectively</p>
<p>absorbed like you want it to create that</p>
<p>effect so it&rsquo;s better to have it on an</p>
<p>empty stomach and not with any other</p>
<p>amino acid</p>
<p>um but then you also said uh what about</p>
<p>other types of vegetables right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um is it cucumber or something like that</p>
<p>yes sir I&rsquo;ll just do</p>
<p>um mostly mostly avocado and then just a</p>
<p>whole cucumber</p>
<p>yeah yeah so you just gotta find out</p>
<p>what what type of vegetables that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bother you and um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I think that&rsquo;s a good good idea</p>
<p>but if you can just also over time</p>
<p>experiment with more variety just to</p>
<p>start</p>
<p>putting a little bit of tension on</p>
<p>feeding these um these microbes a</p>
<p>variety of things that have uh</p>
<p>vegetables that that don&rsquo;t irritate you</p>
<p>yet can actually</p>
<p>um give you more of like a diversified</p>
<p>you know gut microbiome</p>
<p>um but again I don&rsquo;t agree with some of</p>
<p>this new functional fibers that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming out with and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>synthetic fibers and they&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s good for your gut health well</p>
<p>do we know that our microbes want</p>
<p>synthetic fibers versus like fibers that</p>
<p>come from flu this is like a whole</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>field that creates a lot of bloating and</p>
<p>gas in people so especially when they</p>
<p>get into keto treats</p>
<p>again this my goodness it&rsquo;s hilarious uh</p>
<p>my blood pressure went from maybe around</p>
<p>140 to around 120 over 80 which I would</p>
<p>like to get to 110 over 70 optimally but</p>
<p>um as soon as I left the kale</p>
<p>um it went back to 140. but it but the</p>
<p>diastolic stated 80 and the strangest</p>
<p>thing I thought I&rsquo;m eating like six</p>
<p>avocados</p>
<p>you know what that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually normal that&rsquo;s normal your</p>
<p>diastolic should be 80 because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want it actually too low because then um</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have that pressure to push the</p>
<p>blood around like you want it so you</p>
<p>want it just like you know roughly</p>
<p>around 120 or 80. so</p>
<p>um I think you did the right thing the</p>
<p>fact that you um it affect your blood</p>
<p>sugar there could be some type of gut</p>
<p>inflammation going on so just be aware</p>
<p>of the omega-6 fatty acids the vegetable</p>
<p>oils just watch out for those they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>so many different things</p>
<p>um but hey thanks for coming on and good</p>
<p>to seeing you again and enjoy the sunny</p>
<p>weather in San Diego as we&rsquo;re freezing</p>
<p>our butts off up here in the North</p>
<p>yes sir thank you Jillian great to see</p>
<p>you again I tell you what you ought to</p>
<p>see Jillian he&rsquo;s got these huge guns</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in super shape he lives in a van</p>
<p>with his honey and I don&rsquo;t know but you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s the real deal so whatever eats</p>
<p>he fine-tunes it and he looks like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the perfect specimen he must do a</p>
<p>hundred push-ups every hour in that</p>
<p>thing but anyway thank you for coming</p>
<p>back on and uh who knows where we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find Julia next he&rsquo;s in San Diego</p>
<p>currently but he&rsquo;s kind of a nomad and</p>
<p>travels all over and Exhibits his great</p>
<p>health for everyone he passes okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh find out if we have some answers to</p>
<p>our first quiz question and in fact we</p>
<p>do with our Lightning Fast audience the</p>
<p>question was which excuse me vegetable</p>
<p>is highest in curcitin if I said that</p>
<p>right Doc and uh 40 say broccoli Sprouts</p>
<p>25 say onions I love them 15 say cabbage</p>
<p>10 say leafy greens and 10 say</p>
<p>cruciferous of veggies</p>
<p>okay well the answer is onions wow</p>
<p>onions have uh very high levels so um</p>
<p>onions um can give you a lot of</p>
<p>different benefits but this this</p>
<p>compound this natural compound is also</p>
<p>really interesting because it actually</p>
<p>can help with allergies asthma it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anti-cancer it&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>antimicrobial it&rsquo;ll also increase</p>
<p>um this hormone in men called</p>
<p>luteinizing hormones pituitary hormone</p>
<p>which can then increase your</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so stay tuned for more information on</p>
<p>that I will be releasing a video on that</p>
<p>topic wonderful let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>social media with just uh give them all</p>
<p>the love today uh oh wait a minute shout</p>
<p>out to additional viewers joining us</p>
<p>from Bulgaria Tanzania Somalia Thailand</p>
<p>Singapore Puerto Rico Kuwait Malta and</p>
<p>Romania wow is there any place left to</p>
<p>talk about this morning okay Judas</p>
<p>um Judith from Facebook you are amazing</p>
<p>not me Dr Burke she&rsquo;s talking about you</p>
<p>I think I love your videos uh you are so</p>
<p>knowledgeable thank you so thank you for</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s wonderful and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see we talked about the lady that</p>
<p>lost 40 pounds that&rsquo;s fabulous let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh let&rsquo;s see we already talked about</p>
<p>that excuse me so Bob from YouTube I</p>
<p>would like to know about your</p>
<p>Keiko powder did I say that right</p>
<p>c-a-c-a-o</p>
<p>gecko pirate if I use it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the fat in um</p>
<p>chocolate uh chocolate cocoa bean and um</p>
<p>so you know it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many um benefits that</p>
<p>would have for health I think it</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know it could could have some</p>
<p>benefits but uh it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s good fat to</p>
<p>use for various keto desserts and uh</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m experimenting on creating these</p>
<p>keto bricks using cacao powder and some</p>
<p>whey protein and uh so far</p>
<p>um boy that&rsquo;s a chemical a chemistry</p>
<p>project to have to get just right</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um at first it&rsquo;s like it tastes like a</p>
<p>dog biscuit and then now I put too much</p>
<p>sweet in there like some natural you</p>
<p>know sweeteners and then now it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>sweet so I&rsquo;m still working on it give me</p>
<p>some time and I will post that video but</p>
<p>uh especially for people that uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see they&rsquo;re on the run and they want to</p>
<p>make their own bars because all these</p>
<p>these new keto bars are just so filled</p>
<p>with again those functional fibers which</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like dextrin corn fiber tapioca</p>
<p>fiber that type of thing wow well</p>
<p>speaking of fiber I think you said I</p>
<p>want to use it in lemon drink will it</p>
<p>help me stop passing gas and without</p>
<p>being scientific you will eventually</p>
<p>explode if you don&rsquo;t uh pass gas at some</p>
<p>point so is this going to Aid him and uh</p>
<p>over flatulence</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it has that effect</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but since we&rsquo;re on the topic um I will</p>
<p>mention</p>
<p>and when you ferment products right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re fermenting you can even</p>
<p>ferment meat</p>
<p>um like in sausage and those little</p>
<p>sausage uh</p>
<p>what is it called like Slim Jims and</p>
<p>that type of thing you can and they have</p>
<p>to put some type of carbohydrate to feed</p>
<p>the microbes so is that bad or good well</p>
<p>it really depends on what&rsquo;s left over</p>
<p>after the microbes eat it it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like if you have Kombucha tea and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s made with sugar so the</p>
<p>question is how much sugar is left over</p>
<p>like two grams so well that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a lot better than other sweet drinks but</p>
<p>even with the with the meats um there</p>
<p>are some companies that are</p>
<p>really increasing the ingredients but</p>
<p>they have to add some carb for that</p>
<p>microbe and so if</p>
<p>if you can get less than one gram I</p>
<p>think now we&rsquo;re in in the ballpark where</p>
<p>we can deal with that a lot easier so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>completely about the type of sugar it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also about the amount of sugar too so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing traces then that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot better okay very good here&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>question Haley from Facebook will your</p>
<p>electrolyte powder break a fast</p>
<p>no because there&rsquo;s hardly any calories</p>
<p>to it there&rsquo;s just minerals</p>
<p>um and uh so you&rsquo;re not going to really</p>
<p>break a fast you&rsquo;re going to encourage</p>
<p>someone to go longer because one of the</p>
<p>problems with doing fast is your if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already going into a fast with</p>
<p>deficiencies of minerals then that can</p>
<p>affect your your electrolytes and you</p>
<p>can have some issues with the heart and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s one thing and then the other</p>
<p>thing is when you do fasting you</p>
<p>actually release a lot of water that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been retained and so with the loss of</p>
<p>the water comes a loss of electrolytes</p>
<p>so you do need a bit more potassium</p>
<p>magnesium and even sodium when you start</p>
<p>doing fasting as well as the Keto Plan</p>
<p>okay very good uh our first question of</p>
<p>the day which I missed miles from</p>
<p>YouTube can you help me with my keloid</p>
<p>can fasting help heal it or eliminate it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s uh that depends on</p>
<p>how big it is I think it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>improve it I would also add some good</p>
<p>quality Vitamin E oil to rub it into</p>
<p>that keloid to help break down some of</p>
<p>the scarring</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another enzyme called um</p>
<p>seropeptase which I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>jury&rsquo;s still out that may create some</p>
<p>positive things because that also helps</p>
<p>you break down excessive um like um</p>
<p>scarring and fibrosis in certain parts</p>
<p>of your body but these are just things</p>
<p>to look at and just research more to see</p>
<p>if that could work for you okay very</p>
<p>good and Stephanie from YouTube like</p>
<p>this question where do you start when</p>
<p>trying to improve gut health and maybe</p>
<p>add to that doc what do you do to screw</p>
<p>it up</p>
<p>you start with the basics</p>
<p>um you experiment</p>
<p>um I right on my website it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free just download the an eating plan uh</p>
<p>plus I have if you can look under videos</p>
<p>the first video is start here step one</p>
<p>and you start there and then if you</p>
<p>start to have bloating with the amount</p>
<p>of greens that you eat then you back off</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have the excessive</p>
<p>bloating then you can do</p>
<p>um do that program and</p>
<p>um get some benefit from from some of</p>
<p>those vegetables so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I would start it keep it</p>
<p>simple</p>
<p>um and then you can modify it but I lay</p>
<p>out a really good</p>
<p>high quality plan on the website and</p>
<p>also my videos so you can um at least um</p>
<p>piggyback on years and years of trial</p>
<p>and error and experience and experience</p>
<p>of a lot of other people that tried it</p>
<p>and just the refining down to you know</p>
<p>what this is going to work for the</p>
<p>majority of people not everyone but and</p>
<p>then see if it works for you okay if you</p>
<p>want to start here as Dr Berg say then</p>
<p>you should start here and that&rsquo;s by</p>
<p>downloading his free app which is good</p>
<p>on Android or Apple devices so make sure</p>
<p>you put that in your quiver of weapons</p>
<p>to assault all this stuff now look what</p>
<p>happens when you download that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that Alicia from Facebook must</p>
<p>have got the app and other things Dr</p>
<p>Berg you are saving my life I am down</p>
<p>144 pounds since May 6 2022 I have 75</p>
<p>pounds to go thank you with several</p>
<p>exclamation marks so good for you Alicia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wonderful story to hear and uh</p>
<p>any great okay let&rsquo;s see uh Antoinette</p>
<p>from YouTube my sister has been</p>
<p>diagnosed with diverticulitis what would</p>
<p>you recommend for her</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s eating and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any additional information</p>
<p>but I will say if you have inflammation</p>
<p>in your diverticuli in your gut I would</p>
<p>probably do carnivore for a while that</p>
<p>way because we know that the fiber can</p>
<p>create some irritation down there I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe that uh</p>
<p>the fiber has started the whole problem</p>
<p>but I think it left you with the</p>
<p>inability to break down fiber I think</p>
<p>this the whole problem starts uh mainly</p>
<p>by disrupting the microbiome and one</p>
<p>cause could be an antibiotic another</p>
<p>cause could be</p>
<p>omega-6 fatty acids and all the</p>
<p>vegetable oils it could also be the</p>
<p>sugar we eat but um</p>
<p>typically</p>
<p>there has to be some pre-existing</p>
<p>weakness within the gut and then all of</p>
<p>a sudden the whole chain reaction occurs</p>
<p>okay very good now this next question is</p>
<p>specifically for our producer Terry</p>
<p>Cornwell and here it is</p>
<p>okay what is the most potent way to</p>
<p>increase uh the growth of your brain</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>have hope Terry okay I want to grow your</p>
<p>brain because here&rsquo;s the thing as we age</p>
<p>the brain does shrink and that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>atrophy and if a certain part of the</p>
<p>brain shrinks too much then we get</p>
<p>cognitive problems our mood changes so</p>
<p>what is the most the most potent thing</p>
<p>you can do to reverse that process and</p>
<p>expand that brain to a normal brain</p>
<p>regrow it back to normal</p>
<p>okay very good get on that audience and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>um oh poor Colleen from Facebook I have</p>
<p>low ferritin and b12 what is the best</p>
<p>way to increase them because my hair is</p>
<p>falling out</p>
<p>so if we look at the question of iron in</p>
<p>B12 which is related to anemia your</p>
<p>nails the quality of hair what food</p>
<p>would have both iron and b12 and it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be spinach it would be red meat</p>
<p>okay red meat you can also do liver</p>
<p>um but I would have a big huge stake</p>
<p>right now and uh you probably feel a lot</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now also realize that to help you absorb</p>
<p>iron in B12 there also is a stomach</p>
<p>component part that you need to acidify</p>
<p>that stomach that could be a part of the</p>
<p>problem so</p>
<p>um if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>like an ulcer or gastritis then you can</p>
<p>take betaine hydrochloride if you do</p>
<p>then you need to heal the stomach</p>
<p>um with something like um sulforaphane</p>
<p>from broccoli Sprouts or maybe some</p>
<p>some zinc kind of sign things like that</p>
<p>to actually heal it then you you have to</p>
<p>go from there but I have done a lot of</p>
<p>videos on this topic you can dig into it</p>
<p>and learn all about it okay very good</p>
<p>next up from the Green Room is Karen and</p>
<p>she is from Ohio hi Karen unmute</p>
<p>yourself and go ahead with your question</p>
<p>for Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>thank you for giving me this opportunity</p>
<p>and thank you for your dedication to</p>
<p>this work</p>
<p>um I started keto</p>
<p>last March and in the first eight months</p>
<p>I lost 60 pounds</p>
<p>wow but two months in to this I um</p>
<p>was diagnosed with an autoimmune</p>
<p>condition called bolus pymphagoid</p>
<p>and they would I was given a prednisone</p>
<p>injection and steroid cream which helped</p>
<p>to clear it up I&rsquo;m starting to get these</p>
<p>sores again and I don&rsquo;t want to keep</p>
<p>taking prednisone</p>
<p>or even the steroid cream but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what to do</p>
<p>got it now question</p>
<p>um before you had this autoimmune was</p>
<p>there anything that that occurred</p>
<p>uh right before that that may have</p>
<p>triggered that</p>
<p>well to be honest with you I&rsquo;ve also got</p>
<p>R A and hypothyroidism and yes my mother</p>
<p>lives with me I have three brothers that</p>
<p>I have to helped do shopping for none of</p>
<p>them are driving so I&rsquo;ve got a lot on my</p>
<p>plate</p>
<p>um but yeah</p>
<p>okay so yeah because there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>something that uh kind of triggered it</p>
<p>sounds like the stress is really high so</p>
<p>um one thing that you can do</p>
<p>um is start taking something that kind</p>
<p>of mimics prednisone but that is very</p>
<p>virtually no side effects and that would</p>
<p>be the vitamin D in higher amounts</p>
<p>vitamin D3 and higher amounts I would</p>
<p>make sure you take the K2 with it and</p>
<p>magnesium because it&rsquo;ll work better</p>
<p>the other thing that you can do is</p>
<p>probably ashwagandha would be a very</p>
<p>good herb for you and some natural B1</p>
<p>that will actually reduce the stress so</p>
<p>then your immune system</p>
<p>can get back into</p>
<p>alignment from what what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with that but um yeah because you</p>
<p>because you we need to get rid of the</p>
<p>inflammation the slippery slope with</p>
<p>these steroids or the prednisone wow</p>
<p>that um that can affect your weight it</p>
<p>affects everything else so I do</p>
<p>understand I took steroids Prednisone</p>
<p>every year for I don&rsquo;t know how many</p>
<p>years because I had poison ivy every</p>
<p>single year I had to take it and to the</p>
<p>point where it didn&rsquo;t work anymore so um</p>
<p>that created a lot of damage in my body</p>
<p>um so luckily I&rsquo;m not I haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>it this year but um</p>
<p>the point is that that prednisone just</p>
<p>makes your adrenals very very weakened</p>
<p>and then one last thing that I think</p>
<p>will benefit you is the whole desiccated</p>
<p>adrenal</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not biased of my own adrenal product</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re taking these glandulars that</p>
<p>definitely it&rsquo;s kind of like a it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a stronger</p>
<p>um approach against this problem to</p>
<p>really support the adrenals and give it</p>
<p>what it needs to kind of function</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;ll have at that I&rsquo;m already</p>
<p>taking 30 000 D3 and K2 okay for the</p>
<p>last eight months so okay then you need</p>
<p>to um and it&rsquo;s taking care of the ra I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a no ra medication good then I would</p>
<p>I would continue that but I would also</p>
<p>add the B B1 and then as well as the</p>
<p>ashwagandha and then also um</p>
<p>oh good make sure you have a really good</p>
<p>probiotic</p>
<p>and do whatever you can</p>
<p>to lessen this stress situation I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably have to do regular type</p>
<p>of aerobic exercise to get more</p>
<p>um flushing of the cortisol out of your</p>
<p>body and the adrenaline but um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re kind of sounds</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a</p>
<p>hard place and that&rsquo;s a not a good place</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>um for your stress so that kind of keeps</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>you know so anything you could do to</p>
<p>improve that</p>
<p>environment would be therapeutic to your</p>
<p>adrenals</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great well listen thank</p>
<p>you so much Karen and love to hear back</p>
<p>from you on to your progress and if you</p>
<p>want to reduce your stress just watch Dr</p>
<p>Burke he&rsquo;s so mellow and he&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>mellow off the camera he doesn&rsquo;t throw</p>
<p>things around as soon as we go off the</p>
<p>air he&rsquo;s just very relaxed and I think</p>
<p>it must be his diet all right let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on uh to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>another question let&rsquo;s see oh no we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t answer this one okay I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>get with it folks what is the most</p>
<p>potent way to increase a growth of brain</p>
<p>cells specifically in Terry our producer</p>
<p>and the audience</p>
<p>45 percent of them say fasting I agree</p>
<p>45 say exercise five percent say more</p>
<p>sleep and five percent say reduce sugar</p>
<p>intake</p>
<p>well everyone&rsquo;s correct but there is one</p>
<p>very very potent</p>
<p>trigger and that is exercise</p>
<p>exercise and then</p>
<p>um you know exercise if you think about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what exercise does it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>back when when people you know um we had</p>
<p>to hunt for our foods and things like</p>
<p>that uh we were exercising a little bit</p>
<p>more right Steve indeed I mean you</p>
<p>literally had to be running constantly</p>
<p>so our bodies have adapted to that to</p>
<p>the point where if we didn&rsquo;t have food</p>
<p>thus fasting uh we would and it was cold</p>
<p>out and all these other things you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to um</p>
<p>make sure your brain is sharp uh you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t have brain fog so or else you</p>
<p>would die you wouldn&rsquo;t survive so</p>
<p>all the ancestors where your body has</p>
<p>come from have survived from this</p>
<p>adaptation and this this mental acuity</p>
<p>that occurs when you</p>
<p>exercise and when you starve your body</p>
<p>or fast and especially even like cold</p>
<p>therapy too so all these things can be</p>
<p>beneficial to your brains and but if we</p>
<p>reverse that and we have a sedentary</p>
<p>life and we car you know eat constantly</p>
<p>and always have food around us and the</p>
<p>all-you-can-eat buffet and</p>
<p>Steve this might be shocking to you but</p>
<p>you know you food is available even 24</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>there&rsquo;s places you can go to that are</li>
</ol>
<p>open that you can get food</p>
<p>even in the grocery store around the</p>
<p>clock stop it</p>
<p>um I know I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe</p>
<p>but uh we no longer have the uh problem</p>
<p>of food but um now we have the opposite</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>wow all right everybody keep that</p>
<p>refrigerator door closed all right Tony</p>
<p>from Facebook which is better for</p>
<p>controlling cholesterol non-flush or</p>
<p>full flush niacin is that a thing</p>
<p>yeah yeah you want the flush for</p>
<p>cholesterol in fact if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the flesh if you have the non-flush it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t work uh for your cholesterol</p>
<p>problem it works for other things so if</p>
<p>you really want to control uh in a very</p>
<p>powerful way your cholesterol niacin the</p>
<p>regular flushing type is the an utmost</p>
<p>awesome remedy out there</p>
<p>okay we need to help uh Ann who&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>to us from Facebook I have MCAS I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>keto I&rsquo;m dairy free and I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory diet help I feel like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t eat anything</p>
<p>n-e-a-s sorry uh uh MC as in Charlie as</p>
<p>okay and what does that stand for well I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know I tell you what and if you</p>
<p>would you know expand on that a little</p>
<p>bit instead of the acronym or whatever</p>
<p>that is uh we will get back with you but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re stumped with MCAS all right let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>move on until Ann writes back uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Ramesh from Facebook sounds like a</p>
<p>vegetarian how can I get uh how can</p>
<p>vegetarians excuse me here&rsquo;s one get the</p>
<p>right amount of B12</p>
<p>you know plants do not create B12 but</p>
<p>microbes do and uh believe it or not and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not bragging on this but our</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder we just we found</p>
<p>out it was like twice twice the values</p>
<p>of our B12</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s microbial rich and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sterilized it&rsquo;s raw but typically</p>
<p>um just to play it safe you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to take uh B12 as a supplement</p>
<p>and the type you really want</p>
<p>is the methylcobolamine not the</p>
<p>cyanocobolamine you want the natural</p>
<p>type of B12</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s funny about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>vegetables and actually what how they</p>
<p>get their nutrition</p>
<p>um mostly they get it from eating</p>
<p>bacteria</p>
<p>okay they eat bacteria and then in that</p>
<p>bacteria that&rsquo;s where they extract the</p>
<p>nutrition</p>
<p>so a lot of people don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a new thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to know but uh Believe It or Not</p>
<p>apparently plants are not vegan they eat</p>
<p>bacteria interesting who knew okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s our next question</p>
<p>all right what is the best</p>
<p>um exercise to increase the growth of</p>
<p>the brain cell I think we covered that</p>
<p>um you want to tell</p>
<p>you want to well we already covered that</p>
<p>do you have another question Steve oh</p>
<p>did we really I&rsquo;m sorry yeah yeah we</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m sorry this is the we did not</p>
<p>answer this</p>
<p>um what type of exercise that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what this should be uh should we</p>
<p>do to increase the growth of your brain</p>
<p>cells not what should we do so now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the type of all the</p>
<p>different types what would be the best</p>
<p>to do to to get more brain cells okay</p>
<p>and Terry I&rsquo;m not picking on you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>concerned for you I want you to listen</p>
<p>up on this we&rsquo;ll get you into the proper</p>
<p>mode for that and let&rsquo;s move along back</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh Leslie from YouTube this sounds awful</p>
<p>I would like to know what I can do to</p>
<p>reduce or heal scar tissue in the lungs</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t imagine what happened to her</p>
<p>well you know there&rsquo;s obviously been</p>
<p>inflammation that then led to scar</p>
<p>tissue in one of the best ways to</p>
<p>inhibit fibrosis in the lungs is the</p>
<p>tocotrenals tocatrinals that&rsquo;ll also</p>
<p>reduce scar tissue in your liver too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a type of vitamin E newly</p>
<p>discovered</p>
<p>other part of the vitamin E complex I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get the mixed with the</p>
<p>decoferols I would just get the only</p>
<p>like the mixed tocotrinals that&rsquo;s it not</p>
<p>with the added to cofferals because they</p>
<p>do compete and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>powerful it&rsquo;s more powerful than the</p>
<p>regular tocotrinos and especially if you</p>
<p>have fibrosis in the lung and of course</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things you can do too like</p>
<p>that Sarah uh I think it&rsquo;s Sarah peptase</p>
<p>enzyme that also works but I would start</p>
<p>with the vitamin E and go from there</p>
<p>all right very good uh</p>
<p>Savita from uh Facebook has a question</p>
<p>uh he&rsquo;s lost too much weight with</p>
<p>healthy keto if there&rsquo;s such a thing</p>
<p>which has a negative impact on my looks</p>
<p>please address my problem well that that</p>
<p>is a real problem isn&rsquo;t it and people</p>
<p>would kill for that problem but it is a</p>
<p>problem and so what you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>do is you&rsquo;re gonna have to somehow</p>
<p>maintain that two meal a day</p>
<p>but increase the the calories</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to increase the</p>
<p>calories increase more fat calories</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>harder so you could maintain the muscle</p>
<p>and stimulate muscle growth that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the solution</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know yeah you might be doing the 10</p>
<p>cups of salad but there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>calories in that so you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to add you know let me leave a little</p>
<p>bit more protein a little more actually</p>
<p>a lot more fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do and that way your</p>
<p>body will at least at the very minimum</p>
<p>um not tap into your own fat reserve it</p>
<p>will actually</p>
<p>um use it&rsquo;ll you your ketones will come</p>
<p>from the dietary fat that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s uh wrap it up with</p>
<p>our last great contestant from The Green</p>
<p>Room this is Karen from Fort Worth Texas</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to unmute her and she&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>going to ask her one question if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Dr Burke go ahead Karen</p>
<p>Karen can you hear us</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>oh oh dear uh Karen we can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>for some reason so I&rsquo;m going to put you</p>
<p>back on pause for a second and if you</p>
<p>would maybe</p>
<p>I what I see I see there&rsquo;s a uh a mute</p>
<p>button on her end</p>
<p>um so if she could click that</p>
<p>I think that there she goes now say</p>
<p>something Karen</p>
<p>okay can you hear me now I can&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>Steve but I can hear you okay okay great</p>
<p>I can hear you perfectly</p>
<p>okay great uh so thank you for being on</p>
<p>your show I appreciate it</p>
<p>um I am a 65 year old a very healthy</p>
<p>woman</p>
<p>um I have been doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and naturally practicing me in</p>
<p>my whole life</p>
<p>um when intermittent fasting became a</p>
<p>thing it was like oh that&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>um and uh my question to you is is that</p>
<p>I always have high cholesterol it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>high and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ve read a lot about you know</p>
<p>listening to your</p>
<p>um talks about good cholesterol that</p>
<p>cholesterol is produced when something</p>
<p>is deficient in your body so it needs</p>
<p>the cholesterol and so I go into this</p>
<p>debate with my doctor you know and they</p>
<p>say well you need to uh exercise you</p>
<p>need to reduce fatty foods stop fried</p>
<p>foods all of that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t is not relevant to me because I</p>
<p>eat healthy I exercise I&rsquo;m at an ideal</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>and so the doctor wanted me to go get a</p>
<p>CT scan to they have a new one that can</p>
<p>look at the arteries to see if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>blocked and when I I can&rsquo;t go on statins</p>
<p>because it it hurts my body but I have</p>
<p>taken a drug called repatha that is a</p>
<p>non-uh Statin drug and that controls my</p>
<p>cholesterol so my question to you is</p>
<p>being a healthy</p>
<p>woman you know my age and I&rsquo;m if I&rsquo;m off</p>
<p>of any kind of drugs it&rsquo;s way up there</p>
<p>so what is your</p>
<p>take on all this like get on the attack</p>
<p>on that or did they do they do a test to</p>
<p>show that you have a hereditary uh</p>
<p>cholesterol problem is that is it</p>
<p>running the family</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hereditary</p>
<p>um but they didn&rsquo;t do its tests</p>
<p>specifically to see if it&rsquo;s hereditary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there a specific test that they can</p>
<p>do for that yeah yeah they can determine</p>
<p>and just rule that out because let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s pretend that it is because</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re eating healthy and you still</p>
<p>have high cholesterol I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>you have high levels of total</p>
<p>cholesterol or is it more LDL or or</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s any more information on that yes</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let me look uh I think I have it in here</p>
<p>I can tell it quickly</p>
<p>um I think it&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>well ask me another question I can look</p>
<p>it up real quick yeah so did you have</p>
<p>high triglycerides</p>
<p>yes okay did you have high LDL</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay did they ever do an advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile where they looked at the</p>
<p>particle size of the LDL</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need yeah that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you need because that would give us a</p>
<p>lot of great information because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for as a pattern a or pattern B</p>
<p>and basically we&rsquo;re looking at the</p>
<p>difference between the small dents uh</p>
<p>LDL versus the large buoyant LDL those</p>
<p>are um it</p>
<p>chances are when they do that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find that you have the majority</p>
<p>is going to be the large buoyant</p>
<p>um LDL which is non-pathogenic so um</p>
<p>that would be a very very important</p>
<p>another test to be really really</p>
<p>important is um to do a DNA test</p>
<p>to to see if there&rsquo;s any problems with</p>
<p>this Gene called APO</p>
<p>apoe okay and you want to know if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a Poe two three or four</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you want it to be like three or two you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want it to be four if it&rsquo;s a four</p>
<p>then that could be more of a risk factor</p>
<p>of other issues</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just an additional test did</p>
<p>they do this CAC test the coronary</p>
<p>artery calcification test yet</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done that yet I have that</p>
<p>scheduled so that&rsquo;s a good thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good plan yeah that&rsquo;s a good test</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to look at calcium</p>
<p>buildup I I mean if you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>healthy I think that&rsquo;ll be low but it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give you a good it&rsquo;s even it&rsquo;s a better</p>
<p>indication than even the cholesterol</p>
<p>test so I would get the advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile to look at those particle sizes</p>
<p>and then um</p>
<p>is that a blood test</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>and the thing is that you know</p>
<p>here you are eating healthy and you</p>
<p>maybe you probably feel healthy and then</p>
<p>you get in a drug and you probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel healthy so of course I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m I</p>
<p>would just do natural ways to lower</p>
<p>cholesterol for example NATO kinase is a</p>
<p>natural remedy uh red rice extract is a</p>
<p>natural cholesterol remedy niacin is a</p>
<p>natural cholesterol remedy these are</p>
<p>things that virtually have no side</p>
<p>effects but they they act like a Statin</p>
<p>um so and then maybe you just don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>additional</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that to what&rsquo;s already coming with the</p>
<p>meal and then reevaluate because um</p>
<p>I think I think you&rsquo;re 65 very healthy</p>
<p>person and uh you probably have a</p>
<p>hereditary factor and in which case you</p>
<p>need to kind of uh drill down on a</p>
<p>couple other things that other people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>okay thank you Dr Byrd you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>well Karen we hope you come back with us</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve you know tried some of</p>
<p>these things because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>you work so hard at staying healthy and</p>
<p>then you have this buggy thing so please</p>
<p>do get back in touch with us and let us</p>
<p>know how that is all going uh and keep</p>
<p>up the great example okay let&rsquo;s uh hit</p>
<p>another question there you go Dr Burke</p>
<p>okay so what is the best fuel</p>
<p>for preventing seizures</p>
<p>all right climb on it audience let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Junior Joe uh is cod liver oil uh for</p>
<p>reducing inflammation</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sort of it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>best because it&rsquo;s omega-3 plus it gives</p>
<p>you the added benefit that goes beyond</p>
<p>like the fish oils with by giving a</p>
<p>vitamin A in vitamin D so you get the</p>
<p>omega-3 DHA EPA and the vitamin A and</p>
<p>the vitamin D all together in one</p>
<p>package so your grandmother was correct</p>
<p>by giving you this cod liver oil uh</p>
<p>Spoonful each day</p>
<p>um they do back then</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s a really good good source of</p>
<p>Omega three fatty acids and uh</p>
<p>you know I I consume a lot of God never</p>
<p>will</p>
<p>um Steve have you ever had the um cod</p>
<p>liver in the can the wild cod liver in a</p>
<p>can yet I wouldn&rsquo;t touch it with it it</p>
<p>sounds gross no I think you would in</p>
<p>attack you&rsquo;d you would like it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh it doesn&rsquo;t even taste like liver and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the consistency of</p>
<p>pudding huh and it&rsquo;s quite delicious cod</p>
<p>liver in a can it&rsquo;s kind of like another</p>
<p>sardine but way higher in omega-3 and um</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily at the first time</p>
<p>eat the whole thing because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of it&rsquo;s a lot of fat but</p>
<p>maybe half of it</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s quite quite good and you can get</p>
<p>it very easily online and um it&rsquo;s a wild</p>
<p>caught usually oh well I&rsquo;ll give it a</p>
<p>shot and by the way Ann got back with us</p>
<p>MCAS is masked m-a-s-t Mast Cell</p>
<p>Activation Syndrome ever heard of that</p>
<p>okay yeah yeah okay I got it and then</p>
<p>what did she have what did she want to</p>
<p>know about that let me go back up there</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh she said I&rsquo;m on keto I&rsquo;m dairy free</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m on an anti-inflammatory diet</p>
<p>help I feel like I can&rsquo;t eat anything</p>
<p>because of that condition</p>
<p>well I think um that quercetin would be</p>
<p>a good thing to take as a supplement and</p>
<p>of course the onions would be good too</p>
<p>um and then also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know since we have this immune issue</p>
<p>um you need to</p>
<p>beef up no pun intended your vitamin D</p>
<p>and the zinc to probably the most</p>
<p>important nutrients for the immune</p>
<p>system but I would uh start taking more</p>
<p>of each of those right now</p>
<p>okay very good uh quiz number four this</p>
<p>audience is so smart and so fast what is</p>
<p>the best fuel for preventing seizures</p>
<p>and 85 percent of respondents say</p>
<p>ketones or healthy fats 10 say MCT and</p>
<p>five percent say coconut oil</p>
<p>well I think everyone&rsquo;s uh saying the</p>
<p>same thing indirectly but it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ketones and that can come from coconuts</p>
<p>or MCT oil but the ketones are very</p>
<p>interesting because</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>fuel particle has a way of bypassing</p>
<p>one of the Hallmarks for neuron damage</p>
<p>which is um an inability for that nerve</p>
<p>cell to take on glucose anymore because</p>
<p>they have abused it they&rsquo;ve eaten so</p>
<p>many carbs and more so many sugar sugars</p>
<p>that it created this resistance into the</p>
<p>blood-brain barrier so now they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the fuel to the neurons and it dies</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you shrink you shrink so but guess</p>
<p>what ketones come in there as a rescue</p>
<p>they can feed the neurons directly</p>
<p>regardless of how much damage you have</p>
<p>from the sugar they can also act as an</p>
<p>antioxidant and anti-inflammatory they</p>
<p>provide the neurons for more ATP and</p>
<p>energy so it really is the ultimate</p>
<p>solution</p>
<p>um especially for people that are</p>
<p>epileptic or have seizures and</p>
<p>um unfortunately though</p>
<p>some of the children that have epilepsy</p>
<p>um you know they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re put on a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet that I would say is not</p>
<p>uh too healthy it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>a lot of times it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>liquid fat and um you know these recipes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I would I couldn&rsquo;t eat that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even like it&rsquo;s called Uh keto</p>
<p>kale it&rsquo;s like a canned</p>
<p>um thing for these kids that gives a lot</p>
<p>of fat and uh but the quality is crappy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vegetable else</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not looking at the the</p>
<p>quality of ingredients and uh it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just about these macros it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>um the ingredients that&rsquo;s like way more</p>
<p>important and not way more important but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just as important so um no wonder</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s not a lot of kids that can</p>
<p>stick to this program for very long</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty disgusting</p>
<p>okay very good well our producer Terry</p>
<p>got back at me he said hey genius how</p>
<p>about giving them the answer to question</p>
<p>number three which I didn&rsquo;t do which</p>
<p>ironically says what&rsquo;s the best exercise</p>
<p>for uh brain cells to shade tear you got</p>
<p>me on that one</p>
<p>anyway uh he&rsquo;s gonna forgive me yeah he</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s doing a Victory lap yeah it</p>
<p>is but here&rsquo;s what they all said 70 of</p>
<p>our respondents say sprinting or high</p>
<p>intensity exercise 20 say weight</p>
<p>training and 10 say yoga</p>
<p>okay well you know you could be right</p>
<p>depending on the intensity but aerobic</p>
<p>exercise aerobic exercise so yes it is</p>
<p>true that uh this anaerobic high</p>
<p>intensity is really good for other</p>
<p>things and many great things so you</p>
<p>should do it but the aerobic exercise</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing maybe a</p>
<p>fast-paced walk with a lot of breathing</p>
<p>maintaining a little lower cortisol and</p>
<p>stress hormone</p>
<p>um maybe like a bike or a jog that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually really really good for your</p>
<p>brain so I like to I recommend doing a</p>
<p>combination because if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>truly doing high intensity workout you</p>
<p>should get sore right and then you</p>
<p>should have rest the next day unless you</p>
<p>switch your workouts so I always like to</p>
<p>mix it up in fact</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even mix it up I I pretty much</p>
<p>do aerobic every single day and then I</p>
<p>do several times a week I do the</p>
<p>anaerobic which is um higher intensity</p>
<p>stuff but that aerobic is very very</p>
<p>therapeutic to your brain and um you</p>
<p>should just get out there and start</p>
<p>walking and getting more oxygen if you</p>
<p>want more brain cells</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<p>very good well I&rsquo;m jogging in place now</p>
<p>now trying to get that effect</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s slow to come so Sharon from</p>
<p>Facebook my friend has bad neuropathy in</p>
<p>her feet that hurts please help her with</p>
<p>any advice you could offer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very easy one uh chances are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from a high carb diet which</p>
<p>in case you need to get off the carbs</p>
<p>but to to turn things around fast you</p>
<p>take a product called benphotamine okay</p>
<p>benphotamine</p>
<p>um and whatever I would just take four</p>
<p>of those a day</p>
<p>spread them out and if you wanted to</p>
<p>just add one more little thing to it to</p>
<p>speed things up alpha lipoic acid is</p>
<p>another good one for this so the</p>
<p>combination of both of those will be a</p>
<p>no-brainer to help support these nerves</p>
<p>and get the myelin sheath back to where</p>
<p>it should be okay very good our final</p>
<p>question this one a true falser</p>
<p>all right true or false UV as an</p>
<p>ultraviolet radiation has</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory properties</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really putting you on the spot here</p>
<p>audience we&rsquo;ve got about a minute and a</p>
<p>half left or something so knock that out</p>
<p>in the meantime doc let&rsquo;s see do we talk</p>
<p>about how exciting it is for people not</p>
<p>in a contiguous United States to be able</p>
<p>to get your products affordably</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re working on that to expand I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;re getting into India I</p>
<p>think uh pretty soon if not we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already there but if you click down</p>
<p>below and you&rsquo;ll find a better way to</p>
<p>kind of avoid the excessive shipping it</p>
<p>would be to ship overseas from America</p>
<p>okay very good let me find another</p>
<p>question while we&rsquo;re waiting for the</p>
<p>answer uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh now and come on and from Facebook</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to swallow your nutritional</p>
<p>yeast tablets</p>
<p>um you know and I&rsquo;m telling you and</p>
<p>crunch them up eat those suckers you I</p>
<p>chew them I chew them um but yes I</p>
<p>understand then you can just get the</p>
<p>powder we have the flakes you just put</p>
<p>that on your salad uh it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>actually has a nice flavor I like it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s non-fortified so it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>these synthetic things uh 30 of the</p>
<p>population has a um genetic problem with</p>
<p>folic acid and so if they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get these synthetic versions of the B</p>
<p>vitamins like folic acid instead of a</p>
<p>folate or the synthetic version of the</p>
<p>B12 they&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of problems</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to build up as a toxic</p>
<p>type thing but if you get the</p>
<p>nutritional needs without that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it</p>
<p>this is why some people have reactions</p>
<p>to nutritional yeast because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the Fortified version</p>
<p>um but before we answer this last</p>
<p>question Steve as you&rsquo;re getting your</p>
<p>thoughts together I would like to survey</p>
<p>you at home</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>um kind of introducing like a new</p>
<p>channel and growing your own food super</p>
<p>healthy food</p>
<p>um and what I&rsquo;m interested in is to know</p>
<p>uh if you are interested in that number</p>
<p>one and number two why what is the</p>
<p>reason you would be interested in</p>
<p>growing your own food I mean is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>just eat it find healthy food save money</p>
<p>what would be your reason for doing that</p>
<p>if you could comment down below that</p>
<p>would be great just so I I know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like um your intention behind learning</p>
<p>how to grow food right inside your house</p>
<p>wow Laurie and I are really excited</p>
<p>since you brought that up I mean you</p>
<p>know the old victory garden that they</p>
<p>used to have during World War II when</p>
<p>times were tough well guess what</p>
<p>inflation and everything very excited</p>
<p>and plus just you bragging about the</p>
<p>benefits of soil and how much a</p>
<p>difference that can make especially you</p>
<p>know as opposed to hydroponic or all</p>
<p>that stuff so I mean I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that are giddy about it we</p>
<p>certainly are I can&rsquo;t wait to start my</p>
<p>uh Dr Berg victory garden well the</p>
<p>audience has come through with their</p>
<p>Lightning Fast answer true false UV</p>
<p>radiation has anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>properties and</p>
<p>99 say true and there&rsquo;s one holdout who</p>
<p>says false be great if he was right</p>
<p>you know when you think about UV</p>
<p>radiation everyone&rsquo;s trying to avoid it</p>
<p>right because it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>cause melanomas and sunburn and</p>
<p>um all sorts of problems but it does</p>
<p>have an anti-inflammatory effect it does</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this is why they&rsquo;re using it</p>
<p>even as a therapy for like psoriasis</p>
<p>eczema and dermatitis and and</p>
<p>um even Vitiligo which is a lack of</p>
<p>pigment on your skin so it&rsquo;s uh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to create a video on the the</p>
<p>benefits of UV radiation which I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find quite fascinating</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also be talking about the</p>
<p>difference between like UVA versus B</p>
<p>versus C so you really understand it in</p>
<p>a simple way and how it interacts with</p>
<p>your your body and this goes Way Beyond</p>
<p>just the conversion of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the vitamin I mean the UV to to vitamin</p>
<p>D three there&rsquo;s other benefits that go</p>
<p>beyond the vitamin D connection</p>
<p>so with that note I appreciate your</p>
<p>attention your wonderful comments I will</p>
<p>see you next week and also tomorrow with</p>
<p>another video on the YouTube channel</p>
