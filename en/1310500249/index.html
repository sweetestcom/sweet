    <p>The following is a conversation with Tom Brands,</p>
<p>Olympic champion and world champion in freestyle wrestling,</p>
<p>three time NCAA wrestling champion at University of Iowa,</p>
<p>and one of the greatest coaches in the history of wrestling,</p>
<p>leading the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for 15 years,</p>
<p>including in 2021 winning the national championships,</p>
<p>and getting a coach of the year award, his third.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known for his intensity, focus, and mental toughness,</p>
<p>embodying both as a wrestler and coach,</p>
<p>the culture and spirit of Iowa wrestling.</p>
<p>We recorded this conversation almost exactly three years ago</p>
<p>after I attended the University of Iowa</p>
<p>versus Iowa State wrestling meet</p>
<p>in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.</p>
<p>Tom graciously invited me to his home,</p>
<p>where his family, a couple of friends, and me</p>
<p>spent several hours chatting about wrestling and life.</p>
<p>We recorded this brief podcast conversation that evening,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t sure where, how, or whether we&rsquo;ll publish it.</p>
<p>But returning to it now three years later,</p>
<p>I realized just how meaningful that evening was for me.</p>
<p>And even though I was nervous,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even put on my jacket,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a moment I would love to share with others.</p>
<p>The mix of intensity and heartfelt kindness</p>
<p>from Tom and his family</p>
<p>made me want to stay in Iowa forever.</p>
<p>I think I will return there soon enough</p>
<p>because of the amazing people there,</p>
<p>and because Iowa is still, in many ways,</p>
<p>the heart of the indomitable spirit of American wrestling,</p>
<p>a sport I love and to which I&rsquo;m deeply grateful</p>
<p>for humbling me early in life</p>
<p>and helping me and many others</p>
<p>build character through hard work.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Tom Brands.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best motivator for you or for your athletes?</p>
<p>Hatred of losing or love of winning?</p>
<p>For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing.</p>
<p>I was not a guy that was about pageantry.</p>
<p>I was not a guy that was about the parade.</p>
<p>When I wrestled in Atlanta,</p>
<p>I rented a three cylinder Geo with my wife,</p>
<p>drove home and mowed the lawn</p>
<p>because it hadn&rsquo;t been mowed for a month.</p>
<p>And I remember one of our neighbors driving by</p>
<p>and they were like, they did a double take,</p>
<p>like, well, that&rsquo;s the, I thought he was in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Well, I was in Atlanta yesterday.</p>
<p>I just sat on the stand</p>
<p>and got a gold medal put around my neck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I was.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it was the right approach</p>
<p>or the wrong approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what worked for me.</p>
<p>But when you were a kid, you and Terry,</p>
<p>you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about winning then.</p>
<p>So there is the lure of winning,</p>
<p>but what drives you is that,</p>
<p>you know, as you move forward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no reason that you have to settle</p>
<p>for anything but being the best.</p>
<p>And if, it just, it would get to you to the point where</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna happen to me again.</p>
<p>So what, the thing that keeps you up at night</p>
<p>is the losses and that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna happen to me again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thought that keeps you up at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thought that drives you in your training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you do, you know, nine ropes</p>
<p>when Gable says do three ropes and buddy pushups</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re out of here and you do nine</p>
<p>or you do them until you can&rsquo;t do any more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very rare ingredient.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more rare I find it is.</p>
<p>The ingredient of loss feeding,</p>
<p>feeding that, the drive of hard training?</p>
<p>Maybe that because everybody&rsquo;s so worried</p>
<p>about the negative whatever</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting too much pressure on yourself.</p>
<p>So maybe that.</p>
<p>But what I meant was it&rsquo;s when a coach says,</p>
<p>okay, finish with four ropes and, you know,</p>
<p>buddy pushups and four way neck, you know,</p>
<p>I would do 12 or 10.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer about what the coach says.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your own demons that you&rsquo;re trying to exercise out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the few losses you&rsquo;ve had in your life?</p>
<p>Are all of them just melt together</p>
<p>or is there something that stands out in your mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy that remembers my career that well.</p>
<p>I know that I am judged on a very small portion of my life</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s minutes of wrestling matches,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of winning,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some losing in there too.</p>
<p>And, you know, people think they know you because of that</p>
<p>and they think they know you</p>
<p>because they see you in a press conference.</p>
<p>But, you know, to go back to the original question,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know how to answer that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no losses that just that eat at you still.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s opponents that I have learned a great deal from.</p>
<p>I mean, my loss to John Smith in 1991,</p>
<p>US Open was something that I learned a lot about.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about positioning.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about the importance of par terre.</p>
<p>You know, in a certain kind of crazy way,</p>
<p>I learned that I could go with the best guy in the world,</p>
<p>even though it was 14 to four.</p>
<p>And this is when Tech Falls were 15 or 12 points.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get Tech Fall and that wasn&rsquo;t a badge of honor for me.</p>
<p>But I knew I could go with him</p>
<p>because it was one point takedowns.</p>
<p>I scored four takedowns on him.</p>
<p>And I learned that I had to move my feet</p>
<p>and I learned what it meant to move your feet constantly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no break.</p>
<p>John Smith is a very, very intense competitor</p>
<p>that people know that now, six time world Olympic champion.</p>
<p>And I felt that firsthand.</p>
<p>But I did not go in there taking a back seat,</p>
<p>even though the score was very lopsided.</p>
<p>But you knew you could stand with the best of the world.</p>
<p>I knew that this is what this is about.</p>
<p>And you know what, you move your feet</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t give up a lace that&rsquo;s so damn tight</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t feel your calf muscle.</p>
<p>And I had to get ready for the consolation</p>
<p>side of the bracket,</p>
<p>because I believe that was in the semis.</p>
<p>And you just learn from that.</p>
<p>And it was better than learning from a win</p>
<p>over a second ranked senior level guy</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a junior in college.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrestling the best on a stage.</p>
<p>So if you look back, you probably spent tens of thousands</p>
<p>of hours on the mat, spilled sweat, blood,</p>
<p>even tears, maybe, maybe a few times.</p>
<p>So technically or philosophically,</p>
<p>how would you do any of those hours differently?</p>
<p>Just looking back at the tens of thousands of hours.</p>
<p>I would be more, probably in my older age,</p>
<p>I probably would have been more relaxed in my training</p>
<p>and probably would have went another cycle.</p>
<p>If I could do it over again, in 96,</p>
<p>I really thought that when Gable retired,</p>
<p>that I would be the next guy in line.</p>
<p>And I was wrong and that was immature of me.</p>
<p>In terms of the coach.</p>
<p>In terms of the coach, yes.</p>
<p>And I knew that Gable was close.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know when, but it just so happens,</p>
<p>you know, 97 was his record breaking year</p>
<p>and then he retired, but I didn&rsquo;t know how close he was.</p>
<p>But I knew that he had, you know,</p>
<p>he went down with a bad hip injury.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re not gonna.</p>
<p>So what does a relaxed Tom Brands look like?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying you would have been a little more relaxed.</p>
<p>More like where, you know what, I was pretty dang good</p>
<p>and I was getting better every day,</p>
<p>but maybe doing a little bit different, a little bit smarter.</p>
<p>And Terry actually did that going through 2000.</p>
<p>He had to do it.</p>
<p>And he would have been in the, you know,</p>
<p>the funny farm, let alone the, you know, the physical farm,</p>
<p>whatever you want to say, mentally and physically beat up.</p>
<p>But he had to learn to less is more type approach.</p>
<p>And how it came around was, is, you know,</p>
<p>you work hard at feeling good.</p>
<p>You work hard in your recovery.</p>
<p>So even when you&rsquo;re not wrestling hard in that wrestling room,</p>
<p>and looking for the toughest partner to go,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still working hard in your recovery.</p>
<p>And massage could be that.</p>
<p>Stretching could be that.</p>
<p>Things like that, that are more fluffy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you weren&rsquo;t as good at?</p>
<p>The recovery aspect of this?</p>
<p>Never, never.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a place for it with young people.</p>
<p>Because in my opinion, there&rsquo;s so much development to have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much development to have happened.</p>
<p>I mean, when you need to learn wrestling,</p>
<p>you need to be wrestling.</p>
<p>And as you get older, your body won&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>And so to learn wrestling, it&rsquo;s more of a,</p>
<p>probably a relaxed approach.</p>
<p>So if you had to choose between two athletes</p>
<p>who would dominate competition,</p>
<p>one who drills 100,000 reps of a specific take down,</p>
<p>specific technique, or one that spends that time live wrestling?</p>
<p>Both, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>And I like to live wrestling,</p>
<p>I was always wanting to live wrestle,</p>
<p>bring the warm up into the live wrestle, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>But where I got really, really good was a repetition.</p>
<p>And I was disciplined enough to know that the things</p>
<p>that you hate to do in this sport</p>
<p>are the things that make you the very best.</p>
<p>And that is a rare ingredient as I&rsquo;ve gotten older.</p>
<p>And you spend a lot of time communicating that</p>
<p>to younger athletes.</p>
<p>So the thing, if you feel yourself hating something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the thing you should be doing.</p>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>I had a strength coach when I was really young.</p>
<p>He was just a fricking guy that would,</p>
<p>he wore white, like he was almost like a nurse,</p>
<p>nurses clothes.</p>
<p>He wore all white from head to toe.</p>
<p>And he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p>
<p>And his first name was Walt.</p>
<p>And he taught Terry and I to hate the bar away from you</p>
<p>on that last rep when you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s a curl, you hate it up.</p>
<p>And then you do the negative and you hate it down</p>
<p>and you hate that bench up and you hate it.</p>
<p>You look at the bar and you hate it away from you.</p>
<p>So I learned and I was young, I was young.</p>
<p>And I remember being born, my mom&rsquo;s sister lived out there</p>
<p>and we were dropped off to stay out there with our cousins.</p>
<p>And I was born a little bit.</p>
<p>And they always treated us really good.</p>
<p>But this was like the single most bright spot</p>
<p>in a weightlifting, like enlightenment,</p>
<p>even though I lifted weights.</p>
<p>But I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to look good and so you can flex</p>
<p>and look in the mirror or is it for performance?</p>
<p>And this guy was about performance.</p>
<p>And you said repetition.</p>
<p>Do you mean technique?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking repetition, technique, technique, technique,</p>
<p>drill, drill, drill, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish,</p>
<p>hit, hit, hit, drive, finish.</p>
<p>So you believe in that.</p>
<p>I believe in that wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>And I believe that you have to do it on your own.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.</p>
<p>So in the guys today or in yourself,</p>
<p>how often do you see people that grow the belief</p>
<p>of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very rare.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s especially rare.</p>
<p>I mean, you can talk about that as a coach,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s especially rare to bring a guy to that understanding,</p>
<p>but you never stop trying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always trying to reach him.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t have a good performance out there tonight,</p>
<p>but you know what?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t stop communicating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of programs out there</p>
<p>that put their head down when things aren&rsquo;t going their way.</p>
<p>And then as things start going their way,</p>
<p>then they rise with the tide.</p>
<p>There was no difference in the demeanor of our corner.</p>
<p>And we talk about that, that&rsquo;s a philosophy.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re reaching your guys that way.</p>
<p>So go back to your point or your question.</p>
<p>Do you believe in the 10,000 reps?</p>
<p>And yes, I do.</p>
<p>How do you inspire people to do that?</p>
<p>So by example, but communication.</p>
<p>But I mean, in my experience, what I&rsquo;ve seen communicating</p>
<p>the value of repetition and drilling</p>
<p>is a hard thing to communicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very rare to have somebody that goes in there</p>
<p>and will do it on their own.</p>
<p>Do you have young guys that step up and do that?</p>
<p>We do, and it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>And the guys that do it on their own</p>
<p>and have done it on their own</p>
<p>are the guys that are in that lineup and doing well.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you talk about</p>
<p>getting to that next level,</p>
<p>a lot of times what held you back</p>
<p>was I did everything the coach asked of me and nothing more.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, you can be a great guy for a coach as an athlete,</p>
<p>and you did everything that coach asked,</p>
<p>but you did nothing more.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really looking for the guys</p>
<p>that go way beyond what the coach says.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want guys that are looking at their watch</p>
<p>running out of the room when practice is over.</p>
<p>We want guys that know what they have to get done,</p>
<p>and they might leave early,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not looking at their watch.</p>
<p>They might be done early.</p>
<p>They might be, we might be on a whole different path,</p>
<p>and this guy just excuses himself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all about that.</p>
<p>We are not autocrats.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an internal engine in there.</p>
<p>Is that something you&rsquo;re born with,</p>
<p>or is that something you can develop?</p>
<p>I think you are born with it.</p>
<p>You develop it also,</p>
<p>and I think that there has to be comfort,</p>
<p>and I go back to communication,</p>
<p>that young people are comfortable enough to communicate</p>
<p>that I need to take the day off.</p>
<p>So what do you mean by communication?</p>
<p>Or I need to do something different.</p>
<p>Communication, exactly.</p>
<p>So letting athletes be part of their own development.</p>
<p>Communication to me is letting them know</p>
<p>what they need to do to get themselves in contention</p>
<p>to be the starting quarterback,</p>
<p>and then to give them boosts and compliments</p>
<p>when they earn them,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have time to waste with lies and cheating.</p>
<p>And when I say cheating,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about when they cheat themselves,</p>
<p>and so those become very direct conversations,</p>
<p>and the conversation starts like this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to waste, and neither do you,</p>
<p>and so why are we wasting our time?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I mean by that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a conversation about your accountability.</p>
<p>If you look in the mirror and you&rsquo;re accountable,</p>
<p>then we aren&rsquo;t taking the time to go through this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already on our way to solving the problem.</p>
<p>Problem can&rsquo;t be solved without that understanding.</p>
<p>And that has to do with symptoms</p>
<p>that you see in the wrestling room.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something where the fire&rsquo;s not quite there.</p>
<p>That has to do with mental, emotional,</p>
<p>spiritual, physical, everything.</p>
<p>Everything that you know about.</p>
<p>You know, I had a boss,</p>
<p>and our athletic director is a great athletic director,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a great athlete,</p>
<p>and our athletic director is a great athletic director,</p>
<p>and he gives us everything we need to be successful,</p>
<p>but I had a boss, his name was Fred Mims,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t think anybody could be better than him,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden this Gene Taylor guy came in,</p>
<p>and then he was pretty doggone good too,</p>
<p>and he actually was just like Fred</p>
<p>and maybe even a little bit more current,</p>
<p>and then he ended up taking a job at Kansas State</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s the athletic director now,</p>
<p>and then this lady, Barbara Burke, comes in,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t think anybody could be better</p>
<p>than Gene Taylor or Fred Mims,</p>
<p>and this Barbara Burke, she&rsquo;s better than both of them,</p>
<p>and the reason why is because she&rsquo;s a problem solver.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t waste time.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s direct, and she&rsquo;s a problem solver,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>You need problem solvers.</p>
<p>So on the flip side of problems and technique and repetition,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a thing called toughness, mental toughness,</p>
<p>something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general</p>
<p>is a little bit known for.</p>
<p>So how do you train mental toughness as a coach?</p>
<p>You train mental toughness by putting them in situations</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re willing to go through</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t think they can make it,</p>
<p>and then they go through it,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden those berries are down.</p>
<p>Does that have to do with physical usually exhaustion,</p>
<p>the four reps on the ropes?</p>
<p>It has to do with that,</p>
<p>and it has to do with understanding why we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>And sometimes understanding why we&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>might not come for months, but there&rsquo;s blind faith,</p>
<p>and we have a heavyweight in the room right now,</p>
<p>this young guy that he&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t necessarily understand it.</p>
<p>He asks a lot of questions, but he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been here four months now,</p>
<p>four and a half months now,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s getting better every day.</p>
<p>So mental toughness too is a matter of repetition.</p>
<p>Mental toughness is a matter of repetition</p>
<p>and having an open mind and being extremely accountable,</p>
<p>and not only accountable that when you maybe,</p>
<p>when something doesn&rsquo;t go your way,</p>
<p>that you look in the mirror and own it,</p>
<p>but accountable to the point of view that,</p>
<p>you know what, I gotta get tough in this situation</p>
<p>right here, right now,</p>
<p>and this is what&rsquo;s gonna make or break me.</p>
<p>And I talked about my own career being defined by,</p>
<p>you know, a couple of minutes on the mat,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re gonna be defined.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna be defined.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So people are gonna talk about you,</p>
<p>so you might as well have them talking about</p>
<p>how doggone tough you are.</p>
<p>What about, we live in a world now,</p>
<p>I have often in my own work,</p>
<p>I hear about this concept of work life balance</p>
<p>or overtraining.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been one of the hardest workers ever on the mat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve coached some of the hardest workers ever.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to over train, train too much?</p>
<p>How big of a concern is it?</p>
<p>I think peaking and burnout are frames of mind</p>
<p>or burnout is a like you let things probably</p>
<p>get to the point where you could have arrested them</p>
<p>with a good frame of mind.</p>
<p>But peaking is a frame of mind</p>
<p>and you have to know, be able to read,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a lot of it.</p>
<p>And the individual athlete also has to know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a frame of mind.</p>
<p>And so when you have a coach that&rsquo;s reading that the right way</p>
<p>and you have an athlete that is knowing that</p>
<p>when zero hour comes that you&rsquo;re gonna be ready to go</p>
<p>and knowing that there&rsquo;s light at the end of the tunnel</p>
<p>if you feel like you&rsquo;re burning that candle at both ends,</p>
<p>light&rsquo;s coming at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>So you think about Gable and that whole dream</p>
<p>of being carried off the mat because you worked so hard.</p>
<p>And again, do you think it&rsquo;s possible to overtrain?</p>
<p>So you said it&rsquo;s mental.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s possible to overtrain</p>
<p>if you have a lot of distractions.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking at your watch running out of the room,</p>
<p>then yeah, that frame of mind</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna lend itself to excellency.</p>
<p>And the thing is, is we have to accomplish</p>
<p>what we need to get accomplished to get better every day.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t kind of accomplish what you need to accomplish.</p>
<p>You have to accomplish it.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in that mindset,</p>
<p>then the clock is irrelevant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no place for a clock in the wrestling room.</p>
<p>And maybe a clock that times a match,</p>
<p>but it may be a clock.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re student athletes here,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why we encourage when you schedule your classes</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have a class that comes right up to practice time</p>
<p>or starts as a night class and it starts at 5.30.</p>
<p>Go to get the 6.30 class or the seven o clock.</p>
<p>So you leave it all behind your heart,</p>
<p>your passion is completely in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>When you walk in that wrestling room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no distractions and it&rsquo;s never eternal.</p>
<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s eternal is death.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes guys come in there and they wig out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an hour and 25 minutes,</p>
<p>or an hour and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>You have to be willing to go as long as it takes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clock.</p>
<p>Again, wrestlers are some of the hardest,</p>
<p>some of the toughest people in all of sports,</p>
<p>but weight cutting often breaks people.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your thought on weight cutting,</p>
<p>both nutrition wise, mental wise?</p>
<p>How do you approach and think of it as a coach</p>
<p>in your own career too?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of discipline and it&rsquo;s a lot of discipline</p>
<p>during a very uncomfortable time period</p>
<p>that really doesn&rsquo;t last that long,</p>
<p>but it feels like it lasts long and it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>But once you shrink your body down</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re hydrated, you&rsquo;ll get through it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a little hungry, but you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re hydrated, once you break that sweat,</p>
<p>your energy depletion goes away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve practiced that.</p>
<p>You come in and you&rsquo;re yawning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re starting to shrink your body down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that time of year where,</p>
<p>hey, I gotta get my body shrunk down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re dehydrated, you are dead in the water.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re hungry and hydrated,</p>
<p>when you break that sweat&hellip;</p>
<p>Have people gotten better with that over the years,</p>
<p>over the past few decades?</p>
<p>I think that coaches, science is better.</p>
<p>I think that coaches communicate it.</p>
<p>I think they always have.</p>
<p>I think the bottom line is,</p>
<p>is having the energy to implement that</p>
<p>and taking a guy by the hand when he doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s new in your program and he&rsquo;s essential</p>
<p>and or he&rsquo;s unwilling to and not disciplined enough</p>
<p>because when you take him by the hand enough,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t learn that discipline.</p>
<p>This is a fact.</p>
<p>This is an important aspect of wrestling, buddy.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not just go and show up for the match.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not about just making weight either.</p>
<p>You gotta be able to make weight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the warm up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the process, getting ready to wrestle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lifestyle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When did you first start believing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to win Olympic gold?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I found out I got really addicted</p>
<p>to wrestling really, really fast, started late.</p>
<p>But looking back at my life,</p>
<p>wrestled my whole life with my twin brother.</p>
<p>And when Terry and I would fight, it was wrestling</p>
<p>and it was to maim.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re trying to maim me,</p>
<p>I better be tough because if I roll over</p>
<p>and expect you to scratch my belly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to maim me, I won&rsquo;t lose my head.</p>
<p>And Tom and Terry Brands, there was no alpha male.</p>
<p>And when it was on, it was on for real.</p>
<p>What do you mean there&rsquo;s no alpha male?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s both?</p>
<p>There are a lot of twins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dominant twin.</p>
<p>Oh, a lot of them.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Very few times is there a situation</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going to win every time in everything</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s thinking the same exact way.</p>
<p>And Terry used to describe it like when we used</p>
<p>to get interviewed a lot about our careers.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;d be like you grabbing a steering wheel</p>
<p>and me grabbing a steering wheel and fighting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it was like when you would wrestle him</p>
<p>or fight him.</p>
<p>And so I had that benefit.</p>
<p>So when did I know?</p>
<p>Well, I got addicted to wrestling really, really fast</p>
<p>in fifth grade and started to research it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why and talked about the Olympics</p>
<p>and put it in my head and remember said something</p>
<p>about being an Olympic champion in fifth grade.</p>
<p>And somebody made fun of me and I got in a fight</p>
<p>in the playground.</p>
<p>And I remember getting pulled in,</p>
<p>getting in trouble for that.</p>
<p>And the people that got me in trouble for that</p>
<p>were smart enough to not rake me over the coals,</p>
<p>but they researched or they actually found out</p>
<p>what the fight was about.</p>
<p>And I was distraught.</p>
<p>I was really emotional, like crying</p>
<p>or whatever you want to say.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to admit that too many times.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t because I got beat up or got my nose bloodied</p>
<p>or got punched in the face or broke my arm</p>
<p>or there was any pain.</p>
<p>It was because they stomped on my dream and they doubted me.</p>
<p>And so I fought for that.</p>
<p>And that was a lesson.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of doubters.</p>
<p>And one thing we talk about as a staff is our staff</p>
<p>has to be lockstep in that hallway, in our offices.</p>
<p>And when you deviate outside of that, that is heresy.</p>
<p>So everybody has to be on board,</p>
<p>confident that you&rsquo;re going to be number one in the country.</p>
<p>When we go forward and we go put our public foot forward,</p>
<p>there is a decision.</p>
<p>We are unified and there is no backbiting.</p>
<p>And we have great people right now.</p>
<p>And we hadn&rsquo;t had that before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had detractors in our Hawkeye Wrestling Club.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had guys that would go out and get rolled up</p>
<p>in ankle laces and not be able to walk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had guys that would go out and get rolled up in ankle laces</p>
<p>and not care in our club.</p>
<p>And we got Brandon Sorensen,</p>
<p>who got rolled up by James Green last night.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Because I know it means a lot to him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t roll over.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t quit because he was on the consolation side of a bracket.</p>
<p>And so when you have that and then you have,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a disagreement, it&rsquo;s behind closed doors.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re moving forward.</p>
<p>And when you have people that when they&rsquo;re meeting your fans</p>
<p>and your supporters, you know, they&rsquo;re talking the right way</p>
<p>with the right message.</p>
<p>And anything that&rsquo;s cattywonk is to that,</p>
<p>you got to be careful there.</p>
<p>You got to be careful there.</p>
<p>So that in terms of affirmation, in terms of really believing</p>
<p>as a team, as an individual, believing that you&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>in the world, did you, I&rsquo;m sure you had detractors.</p>
<p>You had people that continued after fifth grade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably where my hatred of losing trumps</p>
<p>my love for winning because I wanted to shove it up</p>
<p>their rear end bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the thing is, is we maintain a high level</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s very few programs.</p>
<p>Oklahoma State, Ohio State now, Penn State.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s four programs that try to win</p>
<p>a national title every year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And these other teams, they get up and they got a good team</p>
<p>and they get up and they get going.</p>
<p>And then when things don&rsquo;t go well, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do it next year.</p>
<p>Or this is a down year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re three years out.</p>
<p>So no matter what you&rsquo;re fighting for first.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t won and you say, well, even one in eight years.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But look at our results are better than anybody out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s besides Penn State.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of our mentality and because we have great people.</p>
<p>Ryan Morningstar, Bobby Telfer, Terry Brands,</p>
<p>our medical team, even our strength coach,</p>
<p>Quinn Holland, we&rsquo;re all on the same page.</p>
<p>And when I send something, I hit it immediately.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to waste.</p>
<p>There will not be dissension in that hallway.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s in together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Can you take me through the day when you&rsquo;re going for the 62 kg gold?</p>
<p>What did you eat?</p>
<p>Drink?</p>
<p>What did you think?</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Um, I have a routine that, you know, I had a routine as a competitor</p>
<p>that I could run through right now.</p>
<p>Um, it was a lot of self talk, very, very positive self talk.</p>
<p>Visualization.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Visualization, um, self talk.</p>
<p>Um, and, and that&rsquo;s how I was able to relax and getting ready for</p>
<p>matches my whole life.</p>
<p>Learned that very early age at a camp and a developmental camp</p>
<p>at a young age, Terry and I did.</p>
<p>And, um, I can tell you what I ate and I can tell you what I did to</p>
<p>relax and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Um, what you have to do is you have to find that piece.</p>
<p>And I just know that when I was getting ready for the finals match,</p>
<p>I had gone back to my room.</p>
<p>I had my relaxed material, you know, and I was able to relax</p>
<p>because I prepared for it.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;m right on this, but just looking at the insane bracket</p>
<p>you had to go through, you had to beat, just to get to the finals,</p>
<p>it had to be three world champions, eventually world champ.</p>
<p>I mean, Dave, and you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk about that and nobody else does either, but everybody</p>
<p>talks about it in their own career.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re making my head big, but yeah, I had a road, I had a road.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That is the hardest bracket I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of Olympic champions.</p>
<p>That is the hardest bracket I&rsquo;ve seen of any champion.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m confused on this, but it seemed like a really tough day for you.</p>
<p>Did you have, did you know the bracket ahead of time?</p>
<p>Did you know who you faced?</p>
<p>You see the draw and it&rsquo;s a two day tournament.</p>
<p>So psychology comes into it as much as physical shape, you know,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s those, you got to sleep, you know, the night before</p>
<p>after the weigh in, then you got to sleep again that next night</p>
<p>after your semi final match is going to be in the morning.</p>
<p>You know, and then you have to go back and rest because your final</p>
<p>matches in Intel, whatever time it was.</p>
<p>And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that you just talked about,</p>
<p>that visualization and self talk, that&rsquo;s what helps you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your routine.</p>
<p>And was there any doubt, any fear, any, anything there?</p>
<p>The fear is the type of fear.</p>
<p>And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today.</p>
<p>Jack Dempsey talked about fear and the fear of losing is what motivates</p>
<p>him to try to take his opponent&rsquo;s head off.</p>
<p>He was a boxer and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So fear of competition, fear of screwing up, fear of, oh, I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But that little fear that, you know what, there&rsquo;s somebody out there</p>
<p>that thinks that, you know what, they&rsquo;re going to, they&rsquo;re going to revel in my,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to, they&rsquo;re going to, they&rsquo;re going to eat it up in my misery.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to love, they&rsquo;re going to be thriving because I fail.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to let that happen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re identical twin brother, Terry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been at him, like you said, your whole life, and you&rsquo;re both some of the</p>
<p>greatest wrestlers of all time.</p>
<p>You won the gold medal.</p>
<p>He won the bronze medal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned, you know, all that really matters is the six minutes or,</p>
<p>you know, just a few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to find your whole career.</p>
<p>So how do you think about that thin line, the tragic line, and how do you</p>
<p>think about that line, the tragic line at the Olympic level between winning and</p>
<p>losing?</p>
<p>I think you come to peace that in the end, when it&rsquo;s over, that you did the</p>
<p>best you could.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the case with Terry.</p>
<p>He has a career credentials are better than mine internationally.</p>
<p>You know, he won two world championships.</p>
<p>I won one and he won an Olympic bronze medal.</p>
<p>And, you know, I won an Olympic gold medal, but I only won one.</p>
<p>The thing is, is that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s important anyway.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is, is that when it&rsquo;s all over, you know, how do you look</p>
<p>back on it?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re kind of like, well, you just said that you made sure that you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going to leave anything undone.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>There were tournaments where I did leave things undone.</p>
<p>And so how do you come back from that?</p>
<p>Well, Terry never came back from 2000 because he retired.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>Duplicate and exceed when you&rsquo;re communicating to these young athletes.</p>
<p>And because of that experience, that makes Terry a better coach.</p>
<p>Because of, you know, 1995, that makes me a better coach.</p>
<p>You know, realizing that there are certain things that unraveled in that</p>
<p>year that I could have controlled looking back on it.</p>
<p>And when you have that perspective, you can communicate.</p>
<p>So what control is there?</p>
<p>Can you control everything?</p>
<p>How big of a role is luck?</p>
<p>Control how you react to an injury, control that.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t have any control over it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, you know, you have whatever and whatever happened, but relax.</p>
<p>And you learn to deal with injuries better because of that.</p>
<p>You have that experience that you let this thing maybe get the best of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>And, you know, Terry put a lot of demons to rest with that bronze medal.</p>
<p>So becoming an Olympic medalist, a few demons could relax.</p>
<p>Well, a little, he will never admit that.</p>
<p>And he probably isn&rsquo;t truthful.</p>
<p>And I should, I&rsquo;m speaking for him, but he&rsquo;s truthful when he says that.</p>
<p>But if I look at it and bronze sucks, but if I look at it, he did put some</p>
<p>demons to rest and I&rsquo;m proud of him for it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something there that is a consolation in the fact that he won the consolation medal.</p>
<p>The consolation medal sucks, but there is a consolation that he won the consolation medal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough medal to win, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But do you see the Shakespearean tragedy of it all that the line between winning and losing?</p>
<p>So you often say that, you know, winning is everything, but it feels like, especially</p>
<p>at the Olympic level, or you talk about NCAA finals or that tournament, you know, a split</p>
<p>second miss move can result in a loss where you dominated all the way up to there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where your psychology comes in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the repetition and all of the self talk and visualization</p>
<p>and the physical shape and everything comes together.</p>
<p>And so that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And tonight, we got beat twice, actually three times, and we out wrestled those.</p>
<p>We lost three matches and we out wrestled the guy for six minutes and 30 seconds, or</p>
<p>one match went to overtime.</p>
<p>And if our guys can move forward with the right perspective, I&rsquo;m confident that they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;d take our guy over their guy any day, any day, because our guys</p>
<p>get up for every match.</p>
<p>And now we got a lot to work on.</p>
<p>A lot to work on.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>I can say all that and I&rsquo;ll take our guy and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But what are they going to do tonight in their meal?</p>
<p>What are they going to do tonight in their rest?</p>
<p>What are they going to do tomorrow in their recovery on their own, necessarily?</p>
<p>What are they going to do Monday?</p>
<p>Great wrestlers can use their imagination with a win that they&rsquo;re not satisfied with</p>
<p>and go forward as if it was a loss.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still easier to go forward with that win.</p>
<p>But they can, they don&rsquo;t just, oh, I won, I&rsquo;m fine, goes on.</p>
<p>But then when they lose the exact same way that they could have lost before, then they</p>
<p>go off the deep end.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when they lose.</p>
<p>They could have lost before, then they go off the deep end and then that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to make the change in their life.</p>
<p>And we talked about that to our team tonight.</p>
<p>And the mature, rare ingredient is, is guys that can get better even with success like</p>
<p>it was a loss without beating themselves up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>You often talk about Iowa&rsquo;s focus on creating individual champions like Spencer Lee.</p>
<p>Can you explain the philosophy of focusing on individuals versus the team?</p>
<p>I think that we need to put them both together and the individual impacts the team.</p>
<p>And, you know, we haven&rsquo;t done that since 2010 and we need to do a better job of putting</p>
<p>10 weight classes out there that contribute to the team.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not 10, then it&rsquo;s nine.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not nine, it can&rsquo;t be four, you know?</p>
<p>And that takes a lot of pride and it takes a lot of, you know, where the coach is on</p>
<p>top of it.</p>
<p>And, you know, you&rsquo;re not just working on the easy things, the glaring things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on everything.</p>
<p>What do you mean by everything?</p>
<p>So, the‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s just some, you know, there&rsquo;s ideas that when you&rsquo;re a coach that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there beneath the surface and you got to find them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where communication comes in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about, yeah, we got to move forward.</p>
<p>Well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, I know what that means.</p>
<p>But how many guys really know what that means in their program?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so many levels of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said before that winning is everything and that means people lose.</p>
<p>Most people lose, you know, there&rsquo;s really in whatever the context is only one winner.</p>
<p>In many parts of our world today, outside of wrestling, that concept, the brutal honesty</p>
<p>of that is uncomfortable for people.</p>
<p>So, how do you think about this very philosophical, difficult concept of, you know, there only</p>
<p>being one winner, that winning is everything, this kind of really painful idea?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s a bad thing to have that mentality.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Akutukov, I remember a story I read about him.</p>
<p>He comes to mind.</p>
<p>You know, Sargush, I remember when he lost in London and I remember the look on his face.</p>
<p>And those are some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport, freestyle wrestling.</p>
<p>And, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what works for you.</p>
<p>You can talk about being at peace with your results and that the approach is and the journey</p>
<p>is what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>But, and that&rsquo;s great and that relaxes some champions and that makes some champions really,</p>
<p>really tick, but not everybody.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And if that wigs you out and that really makes you uptight, then go the other route.</p>
<p>You have to find what works for you.</p>
<p>And that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lazy, forget it, forget it.</p>
<p>So, you and Terry, but in general, how do you find the line between extremely physical,</p>
<p>extreme physical wrestling and rough wrestling or angry wrestling?</p>
<p>So, to which degree has anger, whether it&rsquo;s in your wrestling room these days or in your</p>
<p>own career, entered wrestling?</p>
<p>Do you see it as a tool that can be used in the wrestling match?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a balance or not even a balance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of balance in the wrestling world.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a balance or not even a balance, there&rsquo;s a line that you go up to and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cross it.</p>
<p>Sportsmanship is everything.</p>
<p>You can get dinged for points.</p>
<p>You can get thrown out of tournaments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rules with flagrant misconduct where you&rsquo;re kicked out of the match, other team</p>
<p>gets the points and then you have to sit the next meet.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s very serious.</p>
<p>The NCAA sends a message, a very serious message about sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, we talk about that.</p>
<p>The other thing with wrestling is there&rsquo;s rules in wrestling.</p>
<p>These guys that are tough guys outside of the rules, that&rsquo;s what you want in your opponent.</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re frustrated.</p>
<p>You got to be a tough guy inside the rules of the sport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more honorable than cold cocking somebody and knocking them out.</p>
<p>So, yeah, anger doesn&rsquo;t mean breaking the rules.</p>
<p>But I mean, you know, a lot of people know you just watching you as a coach.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit of passion there.</p>
<p>Well, come and do what you&rsquo;re doing tonight.</p>
<p>I mean, break bread with me in my kitchen and see how big of a jackass I am.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re a pretty nice guy.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not asking for that necessarily, but thanks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, you know what, as a coach, I mean, okay, come spend a month in our program and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see really what kind of people we are.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a stigma out there because they are very threatened by our program.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody else that threatens the sport of wrestling like we do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a legend to Iowa wrestling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one of the most intimidating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a legend to John Smith.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>They get up for John Smith.</p>
<p>They get up for Oklahoma State.</p>
<p>They get up for Penn State.</p>
<p>My question is, okay, I&rsquo;ll answer it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer it this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example in my coaching career.</p>
<p>I coached at Virginia Tech for 22 months.</p>
<p>We recruited the number one recruiting class.</p>
<p>We got the administration to change 100% 180 how they looked at wrestling.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>And because of how serious we were and because we weren&rsquo;t idiots,</p>
<p>we were able to do that with our administration.</p>
<p>But my point is this, we tried to win.</p>
<p>We tried to win, even at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a stepping stone for me.</p>
<p>It ended up being one quickly and looking back on it.</p>
<p>I was a fool to think that I&rsquo;d be there for 20 years.</p>
<p>But you believed you would be.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So do you remember a time that you really pushed yourself to your limits?</p>
<p>So Gable talks about having to be carried off the mat.</p>
<p>Have you really found that level?</p>
<p>I said something about that too in a book and I think I was mistaken.</p>
<p>A book and I think I was misquoted one time.</p>
<p>And actually it was Gable&rsquo;s quote.</p>
<p>And I was trying to make the point that Gable&rsquo;s quote was like this.</p>
<p>And they were making it like it was my own words.</p>
<p>I think it was a first wrestling tough book, but it&rsquo;s a good book.</p>
<p>But the story is Gable&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anybody that has done that besides him.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very rare quality.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve definitely been in that nirvana level of, you know, you could go all day long.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, you have to shoot me to stop me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a balance because you&rsquo;re not going hard with and holding your breath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, it&rsquo;s a relaxed and like you got a guy cornered and who&rsquo;s most dangerous?</p>
<p>Well, the guy that&rsquo;s cornered.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where you relax, I&rsquo;m not bum rushing him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relaxed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still moving, fake and very fluid.</p>
<p>Guy falls down his face.</p>
<p>I run around behind him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s offense.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to just grunt to the leg and call that offense.</p>
<p>Offense is a in and out, smooth.</p>
<p>Now you sound like a Russian wrestler.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re the best in a certain light, looking at the history of wrestling.</p>
<p>Wrestling is much bigger than folk style, freestyle, Greco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one of the oldest forms of combat period.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been cave drawings 15,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Do you ever see, so you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, uh, one of the great coaches of all time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now focused on a particular rule style right now, but do you ever see wrestling</p>
<p>as bigger than all of the, this, you know, as, as, uh, one of the pure combats?</p>
<p>I do, and we&rsquo;re raising $20 million for a facility to make it the best facility on the planet.</p>
<p>We have a vision to build the best facility on planet earth and put the best wrestlers in it.</p>
<p>And that is bigger than wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the university of Iowa and our donors are doing it for the university of Iowa, but it is</p>
<p>about the value of wrestling to me.</p>
<p>Also, there is so much value to wrestling blind, blind people don&rsquo;t play football.</p>
<p>They wrestle blind people, don&rsquo;t play basketball.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe they do, but it&rsquo;d be very difficult.</p>
<p>They can wrestle.</p>
<p>Wrestling is a field sport.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ball.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just two guys or two girls and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And, and you, I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to say you can&rsquo;t because somebody will get a hold of this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get an email or a letter that says, you said blind people can&rsquo;t play baseball and blah, blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that blind people can wrestle very effectively.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wrestled with, with my eyes shut.</p>
<p>I mean, was honest about it too.</p>
<p>And it was, I was effective.</p>
<p>So why, why was I able to be effective?</p>
<p>Because wrestling is a, is a, is a sport that you, you can overcome a lot, your demons that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re overcoming, they&rsquo;re not limited with whether I&rsquo;m blind or not.</p>
<p>The demons that are overcoming are inside you.</p>
<p>You have to overcome those demons from within.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the future of Iowa wrestling look like with this facility and this momentum you have now</p>
<p>and this great group of guys you have now?</p>
<p>We have a good young group of guys and, um, you know, there is a lot of buzz in the program.</p>
<p>And probably hasn&rsquo;t been this much buzz for quite some time.</p>
<p>And our job is to, you know, be relaxed and be focused and not get caught up in the buzz.</p>
<p>Um, but we have to put it together and we have a catalyst Spencer Lee, but he&rsquo;s going to have to,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to have to get better.</p>
<p>And we have some other catalysts as well that are, um, you know, going to help us in the future.</p>
<p>Um, but they got to get better.</p>
<p>And so all this stuff about independence and accountability and, you know, being able to</p>
<p>get better every day under duress and not knowing that you&rsquo;re getting better, but you are, you know,</p>
<p>you know what that, you know what I mean by that?</p>
<p>Like the great thing about Gabo was wrestling for him was, is you were getting better and</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know you were getting better.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, just like you said, uh, grow from success.</p>
<p>So even you, you never allow yourself to think that you&rsquo;re, that you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re getting good.</p>
<p>All of a sudden you do something in the practice room that you&rsquo;ve been working on and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you hit it and it&rsquo;s like, it was automatic.</p>
<p>And then that, you know, yeah, that multiplies success.</p>
<p>And so if I may say, so you&rsquo;re a bit of a man of the Bible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, where do you go, what do you go to the Bible for your faith, strength, love, patience?</p>
<p>I talked about things that you can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>You turn them over.</p>
<p>So the biggest thing for me is I got to turn over the things that I can&rsquo;t control, turn them over</p>
<p>to that power and I&rsquo;m going to be a lot better off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why I&rsquo;m not in the funny farm because very competitive to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very serious that we, we know that these young wrestlers come to school here to be the</p>
<p>best that they can be and to accomplish goals that like me, when I was young, they&rsquo;ve set out</p>
<p>to accomplish and they chose Iowa to do that.</p>
<p>So we have to deliver.</p>
<p>And because of that, um, peace with God, you know, it&rsquo;s peer, it&rsquo;s a peer motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a peer motivation and it&rsquo;s a peer platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not doing this for my ego.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not corrupt people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not liars and cheaters.</p>
<p>And so often that gets in the way of a decent person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you&rsquo;re a good person and God helps you be that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re serious about wrestling.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So a couple more questions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of family in wrestling?</p>
<p>You mentioned your wife, who I read, uh, turned you down when you asked her for a phone number,</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s in the phone book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty smooth.</p>
<p>Her story of that is that she didn&rsquo;t want me to have to remember the number.</p>
<p>And I say at this point, and I say, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>And I remember it very clearly like, Hey, it&rsquo;s in the phone book.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, she&rsquo;s blowing me off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But luckily here&rsquo;s the thing with family.</p>
<p>I mean, we, we have great people in our program.</p>
<p>We have great parents.</p>
<p>We have a culture of parents that that&rsquo;s part of the buzz.</p>
<p>And this class that you see wrestling right now, that&rsquo;s been here a year now,</p>
<p>um, Lee, Mirren, Costello, Warner, and then Lugo was a transfer and I&rsquo;m forgetting somebody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget anybody, but, um, these parents are phenomenal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different parental culture.</p>
<p>Um, so the Kemmerer&rsquo;s dad is the same and, and, um, so there&rsquo;s a lot of good there.</p>
<p>And that, that&rsquo;s a big, that&rsquo;s a big, a big move because how we talk to parents, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk to parents to get along with them.</p>
<p>We talk to parents to help them understand, you know, where we&rsquo;re at with their sons.</p>
<p>And when you can have a direct conversation with a parent who helping his son or her son,</p>
<p>the mom helping her son to be accountable and to own it, then you can get a lot accomplished.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re solving problems.</p>
<p>Like I talked about earlier, um, that&rsquo;s part of the family.</p>
<p>The other part of the family is the coaches, um, are like family.</p>
<p>The other part of the family is the coaches, uh, significant others and wives are part</p>
<p>of the family.</p>
<p>And we fed, you know, we fed 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and wives and their</p>
<p>children here at Thanksgiving, and that equals 70 people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So family means administration.</p>
<p>Gary Varda, my, my athletic director gives us everything that we need to be successful.</p>
<p>And he has an open mind for, for the sport of wrestling and wrestling is important in</p>
<p>Iowa.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a no brainer, but not if you&rsquo;re not a wrestling guy, but he sees we do it</p>
<p>the right way.</p>
<p>And so the commitment is there from him.</p>
<p>If we were doofuses, you know, he, the commitment wouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>So family is, everybody&rsquo;s all in, I mean, it&rsquo;s from the wrestlers to the family.</p>
<p>It goes back to what I said earlier about our people.</p>
<p>Our people are great.</p>
<p>Ryan Morty Star is great.</p>
<p>Bobby Telford is great.</p>
<p>Bobby Telford took over for a guy named Ben Burhow, who is great.</p>
<p>Our medical team is great.</p>
<p>Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, Jesse Donaworth, our athletic trainer is great.</p>
<p>Terry Brands is great.</p>
<p>Mariah Stickley and, and Elise Owens, our managers are great.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s a manager as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re hardworking young women.</p>
<p>Our rest, our Hawkeye Wrestling Club is, is where it needs to be in terms of how they</p>
<p>help in their role.</p>
<p>And now we have four women in there and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And, you know, at least one of their dads is super involved with us.</p>
<p>But, and so it&rsquo;s, one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned is that you have to have that.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that, then you have to address it quickly.</p>
<p>And those outliers, you know, let&rsquo;s solve that problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it out in the open here.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re, you know, if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, it&rsquo;s not going to work out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Next year.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;d be legal, but I&rsquo;d have to check with our compliance and, you</p>
<p>know, they&rsquo;d have to vet you.</p>
<p>You could come, you can come and see what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>This room is full.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I&rsquo;ll be back next year then.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>In 2014, I watched this video four years ago of you competing in, I believe, your first</p>
<p>swim meet against your brother, Terry.</p>
<p>And you came out victorious.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, did you cheat?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>I had researched this thing because I&rsquo;m, that&rsquo;s how I am.</p>
<p>You practiced.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I researched it.</p>
<p>In swimming, if you flinch on that starter block, it&rsquo;s a false start.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t twitch a finger and because they would be doing that to get their buddy to</p>
<p>move or the guy next to him, you know?</p>
<p>So you have to be rock solid.</p>
<p>Well, when we went, Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>And so I was like, no, no, no, false start, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t hear me.</p>
<p>It was already in the water.</p>
<p>And so he took off like a bat out of you know where for the end of the pool and couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear me and got to the end of the pool and it was a down and back.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a hard thing to do with a guy with no body fat.</p>
<p>And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end of the pool and he was like,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s, where&rsquo;s he at?</p>
<p>Cause he didn&rsquo;t see me.</p>
<p>And so we stopped him and then he came back and then we went another one and I beat him.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s the only time that, you know, I would say that he was tuckered out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why.</p>
<p>And, um, I&rsquo;ll also say this, we did a time where we timed my race, the one I won, and</p>
<p>then we timed his first down to the wall.</p>
<p>And then we timed his, the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the</p>
<p>way back and he&rsquo;d beat me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only time.</p>
<p>The way back and he&rsquo;d beat me now.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for being a, that&rsquo;s pretty honest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty honest.</p>
<p>Accountable.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Person.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you something else.</p>
<p>Getting in those shorts, those swim trunks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>They are tight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So is there, outside of wrestling, is there a thing that Terry got the better of you?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess this could count as one, uh, that you&rsquo;re still really bitter about that</p>
<p>you need to avenge.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s past.</p>
