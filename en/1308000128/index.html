    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to the All In podcast. We&rsquo;re back. Thanks to Freeberg and Saks</p>
<p>for moderating the show into the lowest ratings in its history.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on. Please give the keyboard warriors that are their bot armies some</p>
<p>respite here. They tried their best. They just did. It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I think the ratings of the last episode must be a result of Google downranking us as a result of</p>
<p>our honesty about not wanting to get more boosters. Saks, you&rsquo;re on the Brigadoon track.</p>
<p>Because somebody at Google, some lower level functionary, to push a button.</p>
<p>Push a button. To shadow ban. I mean, visibility filter us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything except the moderation skills of the two Davids.</p>
<p>Yeah, no way it&rsquo;s the moderator turning it into Fox Sunday.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be that.</p>
<p>The reaction I got from our COVID vaccine discussion was, hey, pretty fair and balanced.</p>
<p>Not in a joking way, but actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, the warning on YouTube was pretty benign, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, if you want COVID information, click here. Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about the market data. The Fed raised 25 basis points. The market</p>
<p>obviously has ripped since then. The jobs data this morning was crazy. We added 517</p>
<p>jobs, more than 2x December, and well above the estimates of 188,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The Fed, I think, is starting to realize they can obviously impact inflation and slow down</p>
<p>speculative assets, but they&rsquo;re having a very hard time with the labor market. Obviously,</p>
<p>labor participation actually is growing. We&rsquo;ve talked about that many times here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bumped up to 62.4%. We all know it peaked at like maybe 69%</p>
<p>during the 2000 time period. Wage growth, though,</p>
<p>continuing to slow. So that is some good news there.</p>
<p>And obviously, risk on assets are ripping the last couple of days.</p>
<p>Tramont, what&rsquo;s your take on where we are with the market and the Fed&rsquo;s action,</p>
<p>which people are starting to believe will be another 25 basis point hike and then maybe</p>
<p>staying high for the rest of the year? Did you hear their comments? You think dovish?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on the market?</p>
<p>I watched Powell&rsquo;s speech, and it was really amazing because</p>
<p>in December, he was extremely hawkish. And he was basically like, listen, we&rsquo;re going to keep rates</p>
<p>higher than you like and longer than you want. And that was pretty clear. And the markets reacted.</p>
<p>And then not but 35, 40 days later, he essentially said we have 225 basis point hikes left to go.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going to try to stick the landing essentially. And even though the rest of the</p>
<p>language in his entire speech, and the press conference, if you read it in the absence of</p>
<p>his body language, so if you just read the transcript would seem very hawkish as well.</p>
<p>But the reality was, he basically capitulated. And then the market essentially said, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the end of this thing. And we&rsquo;ve talked about this before, but markets tend to bottom</p>
<p>six to nine months before it&rsquo;s clear that you could have done this. And so we&rsquo;re a little bit</p>
<p>off to the races in the short term. It&rsquo;s compounded by a couple of other factors.</p>
<p>One is that at the end of last year, so many people were tax loss harvesting, which means</p>
<p>if you had some gain somewhere else, you sold some things that were losing money so that you</p>
<p>could net the two together. You saw a lot of stocks, Tesla was probably the poster child for</p>
<p>this trade all the way down to like $108 a share, and it&rsquo;s effectively doubled in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Right? So everybody tax loss harvested, everybody degrossed, nobody was really owning anything.</p>
<p>And then when Powell basically said, we&rsquo;re mostly done. There&rsquo;s been so much systematic buying right</p>
<p>now that nobody&rsquo;s really well positioned. To me, this is very similar and eerily reminiscent of</p>
<p>the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. And if you guys remember, at the end of 2018, October,</p>
<p>November, December, the markets just fell. And part of it was Powell&rsquo;s going to raise rates,</p>
<p>inflation is getting out of control, etc, etc. And then we got all this data that said China</p>
<p>may be entering a real period of malaise. And Powell capitulated, again, trying to stick the</p>
<p>landing. And long story short, he didn&rsquo;t. That was a head fake, and the markets just ripped higher.</p>
<p>Then we went into the COVID pandemic, and all of that stuff happened. So</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re about to replay a little bit of that, at least in the next 30 to 90 days,</p>
<p>the pain trade is to go up. So that&rsquo;s probably where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Fed Fund rates chart from 2000. And into the 2008 recession. And you see just,</p>
<p>you know, to Jamal&rsquo;s point in 2019, that little step up to 2%. And then this dramatic step up</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been on up to four and a half or so. Sachs, is this where the Fed pauses,</p>
<p>you think they cut? And what overall effect is this going to have on</p>
<p>venture capital in the startup market, which is super important to us?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in the whipsaw economy here. Just a month ago, sentiment was incredibly negative.</p>
<p>On the show, we were predicting for the year that we were looking at the Fed Funds rate going from</p>
<p>four and a half percent to say five and a half percent to 50 point increases. The belief was</p>
<p>that we were going to have a recession later this year. I think that was pretty much consensus.</p>
<p>And now three weeks later, you had a situation in which we got a couple of really good inflation</p>
<p>reports. So all of a sudden, the consensus changed to, we&rsquo;re not going to need to raise rates,</p>
<p>you know, to five and a half percent, maybe we only get one or two more quarter point</p>
<p>rates. And the market just ripped on the belief that inflation was in the rear view mirror,</p>
<p>the problem had been licked, and now we can just kind of move forward. And the Fed seemed to confirm</p>
<p>that just yesterday with a quarter point rate increase. And now today, we have this wild</p>
<p>jobs report with over half a million new jobs, the expectation was only 100,000.</p>
<p>And so now all of a sudden, people are wondering, well, wait a second, does this mean that labor</p>
<p>costs are going to go back up, that the economy is overheating, and now the Fed&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>to raise more. So I would say literally from week to week, we&rsquo;re being whipsawed between expectations</p>
<p>of whether inflation has been conquered or not, whether the economy is going to have a recession</p>
<p>or not. And I think probably where we&rsquo;re sitting at this moment is, you&rsquo;d have to say that the</p>
<p>risks of inflation returning are slightly higher, but the risks of a recession are slightly lower,</p>
<p>because with this kind of jobs report, better chance of having a soft landing here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard, in other words, Sachs, to have a recession,</p>
<p>if people are employed, if people are employed.</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re down to 3.4%. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>50 year low.</p>
<p>Right. So I just think that we&rsquo;re in a highly volatile economy, and it&rsquo;s very hard to predict</p>
<p>the future. I&rsquo;d say that relative to where we were a month ago, you&rsquo;d have to say that the</p>
<p>odds of us having a soft landing this year are quite a bit better than they were just a few weeks</p>
<p>ago. All right, Freeberg, when we look at this employment picture, it does seem people are going</p>
<p>back to work. Seems maybe indicative of people blew through their savings. We talked about this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been harping on and on, previous episodes, I&rsquo;ve had people doing personal debt, buy now,</p>
<p>pay later. Is a possible thesis here that people YOLOed for so long, post pandemic,</p>
<p>Coachella, vacations, etc. That maybe they whipped through their savings,</p>
<p>it seems like we&rsquo;ve burned off a trillion in savings or something like that, and the debt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going up. So now people maybe need to go back to work, and they&rsquo;re finally capitulating and</p>
<p>taking jobs. Do you think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually happening here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would classify that. I mean, there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of this stuff is on the</p>
<p>margin. The one challenge, you know, Larry Summers has been harping on since last spring,</p>
<p>all the way through the summer and the fall. And, you know, in multiple kind of interviews and</p>
<p>publications he&rsquo;s done, he&rsquo;s the ex US Treasury Secretary, obviously, brilliant economist,</p>
<p>that the US needs to have a five to 6% jobless rate for five years, in order for us to really</p>
<p>get to the inflation rate target of two to 3% or below 2%. And so, you know, the economists</p>
<p>and the macro guys that are tracking their jobs report today are the I think the indication is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not there yet. And that the implication of a tight job market is wages go up and wages go up,</p>
<p>inflation goes up and because companies need to charge more because they have to pay more to get</p>
<p>talent. And this obviously continues to support the escalatory spiral that drives inflation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, the, you know, kind of downside to the jobs report today, that I think a lot of</p>
<p>folks are watching the Fed mentioned over and over again, deflation. So any impact there,</p>
<p>Chamath, you think we&rsquo;re going to see prices start to crater? And what impact would that have</p>
<p>on the market? I think Sachs is right. I think the the marginal risk here is is for this website.</p>
<p>So we have a period now which is disinflationary. But the problem is, if the stock market keeps</p>
<p>going up, and all of a sudden we have less restrictive monetary conditions, then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be back at the same place we were before, which is money sloshing around into all kinds of</p>
<p>risky assets, or more money, you know, there&rsquo;s still an enormous amount of money sitting on the</p>
<p>sidelines that has to come into the market now if this thing keeps going higher. So we&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>delicate moment. And if we reignite inflation, because all of a sudden, more companies have</p>
<p>more liquidity that they can tap, right, more money, they can raise more money as a result</p>
<p>that they can spend. Because we don&rsquo;t have this first inflationary cycle under control,</p>
<p>there could be a risk that that we reignite inflation. And so then, then they have to</p>
<p>capitulate, the Fed has to capitulate again and start another hiking cycle. So I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>complicated moment. I think all of the smart money in Wall Street that I talked to up until this</p>
<p>point, they forecasted like this period would be choppy. And the second half of the year would be</p>
<p>really robust and like you needed to be super long and things were going to be incredible.</p>
<p>And when I talked to them this week, they&rsquo;re like, Oh, God, we weren&rsquo;t positioned for this,</p>
<p>we had no risk going into this, we&rsquo;re going to be forced buyers. There&rsquo;s a bunch of companies</p>
<p>that are whispering that they want to go public now. Oh, really? The big banks have been calling</p>
<p>around trying to book build quietly for some IPOs. And so if they try to kind of crack this</p>
<p>capital markets open, I think there&rsquo;s again, the marginal risk will be that we do whipsaw</p>
<p>sex when you say book build, you mean trying to see if you&rsquo;ll get some early takers to buy equity</p>
<p>in an IPO, perhaps even in a company like stripe that&rsquo;s been sitting on the sideline.</p>
<p>So not stripe, they&rsquo;re in a complicated moment. But when they call to book build,</p>
<p>they basically say, Hey, listen, XYZ company, quiet filed, look at the s one, what do you think,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the price, blah, blah, blah. And they&rsquo;re trying to get an indication of whether you&rsquo;d want</p>
<p>to be in the IPO book. So I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of those testing the waters that are now</p>
<p>starting again, would there be an appetite in your mind for an IPO in the second quarter of</p>
<p>like a stripe type company, but you know, I don&rsquo;t know what the other candidates are the lead</p>
<p>candidates, but tribe is one people talk about most, the thing that we have to think about is</p>
<p>like, most of the market are not people, right? Most of the market are computers and algorithms</p>
<p>and ETFs. It&rsquo;s an extremely formulaic buying model. Do you have components of an index,</p>
<p>those represent certain percentages, you have to own those percentages to be relevant as that index.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this reinforced buying loop, as well as a reinforced selling loop, right?</p>
<p>So when things start moving, those folks have to just systematically move money in</p>
<p>all the humans know that. So the humans tend to front run all the computers,</p>
<p>and they basically are the ones that sell into these guys. And then that&rsquo;s what inflates these</p>
<p>prices. Similarly, on the way down humans try to front run it by being short into that stuff.</p>
<p>So we could see the capital markets open, even if we don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s actually the worst scenario,</p>
<p>because now you have all this money going into a fewer number of names.</p>
<p>That sort of explains Facebook has doubled in in 3060 days. Yeah, it was about Tesla,</p>
<p>Tesla has doubled in 30, you know, 3060 days, a lot of the tech stocks, like high beta stocks</p>
<p>that we are all, you know, helping to build, those companies have just absolutely ripped 60 to 100%.</p>
<p>These are not healthy and normal moves. And so the question is what happens if</p>
<p>inflation somehow, all of a sudden pokes itself back up right now, it doesn&rsquo;t look like it is.</p>
<p>And Powell was clear. And it&rsquo;s true. We&rsquo;re in a deflation. He said deflation 11 times during his</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very clear about his use of language.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why the market rips. I mean, basically, that was all part of a narrative</p>
<p>where inflation is on its way out, we&rsquo;ve licked that problem. And that&rsquo;s what the market was</p>
<p>pricing in. And I think now the question is, in light of today&rsquo;s jobs report, is that actually</p>
<p>true or not? And I&rsquo;m sorry, disinflation, not deflation, disinflation. Yeah. So I think,</p>
<p>you know, one way to one way to look at this is, Jake, how you showed the chart of the Fed</p>
<p>funds rate. Another chart is the yield curve. We just pull up the yield curve for a second.</p>
<p>This is the yield on US Treasuries on you know, our T bills. And one way to look at this is as</p>
<p>a prediction market of where the market thinks interest rates are going, because the Fed sets</p>
<p>the rate for the Fed funds rate, which is the overnight rate of lending to banks, but they do</p>
<p>not set the rate of, you know, three months, six months, bonds, 10 year bonds, and so on.</p>
<p>The market does because the market trades those bonds, and it imputes a yield that the market</p>
<p>requires to want to hold those bonds. So what&rsquo;s interesting is that if you view the yield curve</p>
<p>as a, again, as a prediction market, it tells you at any given time, what the collective wisdom is</p>
<p>of the market. Now, this thing is fluctuating, moving all the time. So that collective wisdom</p>
<p>is changing. But where things are today, it&rsquo;s pretty interesting. It looks like what the market</p>
<p>is saying is that within the next six months, the rate peaks at 4.75%. So Nick, if you just want to</p>
<p>hold the mouse on the six month dot, you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s 4.76%. So basically, the market is predicting</p>
<p>we get maybe one more quarter point, roughly, not much. And then if you go to the two-year,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at 4.09%, so a little over 4%. So what the market is actually predicting is that over the</p>
<p>next two years, we&rsquo;re actually going to get a 50 basis point decrease from the Fed. And then if you</p>
<p>go to, say, the five-year or the 10-year, we&rsquo;re at 3.5%. So the market is basically saying that</p>
<p>long-term rates are going to stabilize at 3.5%. We&rsquo;re not going back to the abnormal</p>
<p>zero interest rate policy or ZERP that they had for 10 years. 3.5% will be the long-term stable</p>
<p>cost of money. But you can see that the market, the prediction market, thinks that the Fed has</p>
<p>done enough to combat inflation because the Fed funds rate now basically is where the bond market</p>
<p>thinks it should be. And in fact, the bond market thinks it&rsquo;s coming down over the next two years.</p>
<p>But coming down to what would be 3.5%, in a world that we&rsquo;ve lived in for largely over the 14 years</p>
<p>of this bull run, the majority of that was at close to zero or zero.</p>
<p>Right. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re never going back to the bubble of 2021, where SaaS companies</p>
<p>were trading at 100 times ARR. We&rsquo;re going to go back to an environment like a more normal one,</p>
<p>where valuations are more like the 2017 valuation, something like that. By the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 3.5% is not a bad&hellip; It&rsquo;s still a great deal. Still a great deal if you got your mortgage at</p>
<p>that. If you listen to Buffett, Buffett&rsquo;s teacher, this guy, Ben Graham, in Ben Graham&rsquo;s book, the</p>
<p>way that he would look at a stock, and obviously, look, things have changed, but the way that he</p>
<p>would look at a stock is he would look at that risk-free rate, he would double it. And then</p>
<p>the inverse of that is the maximum price to earnings ratio that he would pay for a stock,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s the trade off is if you can get more than two times the risk-free rate,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s worth owning a company. What that means is that if you take 3.5% as a terminal rate,</p>
<p>the right PE is around 14 for the S&amp;P 500. Right now, the S&amp;P 500 trades at 22 times PE,</p>
<p>which would mean that we are 50% overvalued. Now that again, that&rsquo;s a Benjamin Graham model. And I</p>
<p>think the world has pretty cleanly moved away from it. But there&rsquo;s probably some rooting in</p>
<p>that intellectual framework that&rsquo;s still valuable. And to your point, David, it just</p>
<p>reinforces that man, we need to start to learn a new regime here. Because when rates are not zero,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of excess that you can&rsquo;t support. Because the alternative trade offs</p>
<p>for investors are plentiful, you know, and plowing money into a money losing startup becomes less</p>
<p>attractive. And to just give people some background, that&rsquo;s the intelligent investor was</p>
<p>that book, I believe, and he was talking about value investing, which is, hey, what&rsquo;s the earning</p>
<p>per share? What&rsquo;s the ratio? What&rsquo;s the PE? And that&rsquo;s something that growth and momentum</p>
<p>investing has been the opposite of and this is a could be, I think you wrote a blog post about this</p>
<p>Chamath, sort of the regime change. If you look at the Googles, the Facebooks, the apples,</p>
<p>Amazons is a little bit of an exception here, those companies printed money, they had profits,</p>
<p>they built up large cash reserves. We look at the next cohort of companies, Airbnbs, Coinbases,</p>
<p>Ubers, etc. They focus on the top line growth, much like the Amazon, which was a very obscure</p>
<p>approach. Correct? Chamath in the history of this,</p>
<p>Nick, do you want to just throw up this chart, we did a little analysis over here. And it was just</p>
<p>basically looking back 60 years of company formation, we looked at all of the 100 most</p>
<p>valuable public company startups, and we index that to the 10 year interest rate.</p>
<p>So what are we looking at here, Chamath with this chart?</p>
<p>So basically, we went back from 1960 onwards. So basically, you know, 63 years. And what this</p>
<p>shows you is the 100 most valuable public technology companies, then the size of the</p>
<p>circle here is their market cap. And then it&rsquo;s overlaid on top of the 10 year interest rate,</p>
<p>as well as gray bars for recessions. So what is this graphic meant to illustrate? Well,</p>
<p>it just was for us to study, is there a correlation between the value of companies?</p>
<p>And what the interest rates were what the economy was doing at the time. And to your point, Jason,</p>
<p>the trend is pretty starkly made on this chart, which is that if you are a company that was</p>
<p>founded in a period of austerity, you had the ability in general to build a much larger company</p>
<p>than that, which was founded in a period of wealth and excess. Right? So when you look at</p>
<p>when rates were sort of approaching zero or were zero, there was a lot of really successful</p>
<p>companies, they&rsquo;re listed here in the in the light gray on the right. But none of those things</p>
<p>really represent the success that these other companies had. That&rsquo;s the first interesting</p>
<p>takeaway. The second interesting takeaway, though, from this has nothing to do with rates per se.</p>
<p>But it is that when rates intersect with the emergence of huge technology trends.</p>
<p>So in the case of the 1970s, it was the PC revolution. In the case of the late 1990s,</p>
<p>it was the internet revolution, those two things, which required enormous</p>
<p>progress in both physical infrastructures, so atoms, as well as software infrastructure bits,</p>
<p>when you put those two things together, those also created big companies. And so,</p>
<p>if you add that all up, the point is that whenever you see huge tectonic shifts in technology,</p>
<p>combined with periods of austerity, that&rsquo;s when the gargantuan dollars are made.</p>
<p>So in the 1970s, companies like Microsoft and Apple from the get go had to be profitable.</p>
<p>Right. And in the absence of one very important round of financing that Amazon was able to close.</p>
<p>The next big wad of companies were founded again in rising rates where they just had to get</p>
<p>profitable or find a way to be positive free cash flow, or have positive working capital</p>
<p>faster than anybody else. So these are like really interesting trends that I think just</p>
<p>say that as rates creep back up. And if we can intersect that with some improvements in technology</p>
<p>over the next five to 10 years that we&rsquo;ve all talked about, it could be a real boon for startups</p>
<p>and startup investing. It would mean people are a little more resilient, a little more hardcore to</p>
<p>use a term free bird. What are your thoughts on this analysis by social capital? It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s probably two ways you could interpret this one is in an era of excess</p>
<p>capital, all the capital gets competed away. And so you pay more salaries, you have, it&rsquo;s harder to</p>
<p>get high quality talent, you make a lower margin, etc, etc. It&rsquo;s much more kind of competitive on</p>
<p>the ground. And then another one is just obviously kind of like evolutionary fitness. When there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>less capital investors are more selective. I think what might make this era a little bit different</p>
<p>than the past is just the amount of terms dry powder sitting on the sidelines right now. So the</p>
<p>total VC capital raised last year, I think was a record high. That means there&rsquo;s a lot more cash</p>
<p>that needs to kind of be deployed in the next 12 to 36 months than has ever been deployed in the</p>
<p>history of venture. If that holds true. So that may be kind of a counterbalancing effect here</p>
<p>where it may take three years before that effect plays out, where there&rsquo;s more of a dearth of</p>
<p>capital. It&rsquo;s certainly the case that institutional investors, endowments, pension funds, traditional</p>
<p>family office LPs and venture funds are making far fewer commitments this year to new funds,</p>
<p>as I think we all know, and that tightening will play out in the venture funds that will get raised</p>
<p>for this vintage, the next vintage and so on. And so maybe that that kind of evolutionary</p>
<p>fitness concept starts to play out later. And sizing and sizing and sizing. I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also this like, you know, we talked about this on our text screen, but the venture business of the</p>
<p>last 15 years. Everyone since 2008, everyone&rsquo;s been trained. And all the younger people that</p>
<p>have come up and are now partners and running the firms on an environment of momentum investing,</p>
<p>rather than fundamental investing. And so there is also a question of how fit the investors are</p>
<p>for a market space, where valuations are flat, or descending, or the decision whether or not</p>
<p>to invest is no longer driven by who else is investing and how much is the company growing</p>
<p>and how much is their valuation going up. But it&rsquo;s much more about kind of the fundamental performance</p>
<p>of the business. Does this match what you&rsquo;re seeing on the ground sacks?</p>
<p>Are people being more dogmatic, pragmatic? Are the capital allocators really</p>
<p>sharpening the knives and looking at these businesses a different way?</p>
<p>Is it actually hit the streets?</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a record amount of money venture capital has raised over the last,</p>
<p>you know, couple of years, but it&rsquo;s going to be deployed much more slowly and carefully</p>
<p>over the next, say, three or four years than it was over the previous few years. So divide</p>
<p>that amount of money by three or four, because the pace of deployment is going to go way down.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think people are going to be more careful. They&rsquo;re going to take longer to make</p>
<p>decisions. I think it&rsquo;s going to be much, much harder for new funds to get started. All of the,</p>
<p>you know, hype around, you know, solo capitalists and, you know, all these, you know, seed funds and</p>
<p>micro VCs and all this kind of stuff. I think a lot of that&rsquo;s going to get washed away. I think</p>
<p>in hindsight, a lot of that was a product of the bubble. And yeah, I think you&rsquo;re going to be in</p>
<p>for a period of some retrenchment in VC. And I think that&rsquo;s good. I mean, I think to the point</p>
<p>of Chamath&rsquo;s study that, you know, that the counterintuitive finding in his study was that</p>
<p>great companies are created during times when we&rsquo;re not in a bubble and capital is sloshing</p>
<p>around everywhere, but when you&rsquo;re in a environment of moderate capital availability.</p>
<p>And I think the point is that we all have to be under some stress, right? That&rsquo;s what evolution</p>
<p>requires is, you know, if an ecosystem or an organism is not under stress, they have no</p>
<p>pressure to evolve and become fitter and compete. And I think that&rsquo;s what makes our industry and</p>
<p>our ecosystem very adaptive over time is that it&rsquo;s constantly, you know, it does face survival</p>
<p>pressures, but over the last several years, all the survival pressures were taken away because</p>
<p>anybody could raise money. And there was always another bridge available. There was always some</p>
<p>extension and there was no some convertible to be done. There was no reckoning. You know,</p>
<p>a lot of these companies just seem to, you know, get another 12 months of runway and other founders</p>
<p>learn so many bad habits during that period of time and so much entitlement and excess built up</p>
<p>in the system during that time. And I think now we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re seeing that a lot of that is working</p>
<p>its way out. I mean, just look at the Facebook results the other day. Let&rsquo;s talk about Facebook</p>
<p>as an example, because here you have a company where the stock over the past year had been</p>
<p>pounded. It was like down over 50% and the market did not like its</p>
<p>answers around the capital investments it was making. And then Brad Gerson, our friend</p>
<p>wrote that letter encouraging them to get much more efficient. And then they did that</p>
<p>and they basically started doing some riffs and basically just getting much more efficient</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re doing and specifically taking out layers and layers of middle management.</p>
<p>I mean, that was really the big thing. So they kind of took a page out of Elon&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>in terms of what Elon had done at Twitter. I mean, not nearly to that extent,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think they needed to, but they targeted this idea of we have too many layers</p>
<p>in the company, too many mid level managers, and the stock ripped just was it like up 2025%.</p>
<p>Yeah. And they&rsquo;re up to, I actually bought it based the day they had the layoffs,</p>
<p>I put in a buy order, and it was closed at $94. And now it&rsquo;s at 193.</p>
<p>And FedEx, of all places, is laying off 10% of its offers, officers and directors. So the idea</p>
<p>now is, hey, in the senior ranks, what is the inefficiency there? How do we get more doers,</p>
<p>more people who actually are building or operating the companies to take the reins and get rid of</p>
<p>this, as you&rsquo;re saying, middle management, this waste that companies have.</p>
<p>Let me tell you specifically the problem that builds up in these companies</p>
<p>is that everybody wants to be a manager. And so you can&rsquo;t just come at this problem by saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to increase the number of reports that each manager has from five to 10. That doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. Because let me tell you what happens is that every individual contributor who&rsquo;s a star</p>
<p>thinks that their career advancement requires them to manage a team. So what happens is you</p>
<p>take that star I see, and then you create a team around them. So that person then hires</p>
<p>five people to manage. And those five people are not a star. Yeah, they stop working, they just</p>
<p>start managing. Well, maybe you get like 20% more production out of that six person unit than you</p>
<p>would have just out of the star, but you&rsquo;re spending five times more money. So it makes</p>
<p>no sense. And the problem is it cascades. So that I see becomes a manager, they hire five people,</p>
<p>then those five people, one of them&rsquo;s a star and says, well, I want to be a manager.</p>
<p>And all the organizational pressure is to keep building more and more teams, and more and more</p>
<p>layers. Here&rsquo;s the quote from Mark Zuckerberg to illustrate your point from a recent all hands</p>
<p>meeting. I don&rsquo;t think you want a management structure that&rsquo;s just managers managing managers,</p>
<p>managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work. Yes, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem of infinite delegation. Every like star builds a team around them to delegate the</p>
<p>work, but then they hire a team to delegate the work to and pretty soon the most junior</p>
<p>interns in the company are doing all the work and all the best people are just managing. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a huge problem. And I think that I&rsquo;d say that a lot of CEOs don&rsquo;t quite understand</p>
<p>the problem because they think that all they have to do is increase the number of reports</p>
<p>that managers have. It&rsquo;s not, you also have to reduce the number of layers in the company.</p>
<p>And just the ultimate example of this, just to put a point on it was at Twitter, what we saw</p>
<p>is that when Elon went in to basically do a riff at Twitter, the first question he asked</p>
<p>in the engineering department is who&rsquo;s checked in code. And they looked at the code repository</p>
<p>and over 50% of the engineering department had not checked in code in months. And you want to</p>
<p>know the reason for that is because the engineers were told that if you want to be a manager in this</p>
<p>company, you don&rsquo;t code, managers don&rsquo;t code, only ICs code. And no one wants to be an IC,</p>
<p>no one ambitious wants to be an IC, they all want to get promoted. So it all gets</p>
<p>Explained what an IC is?</p>
<p>Just individual contributor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the whole thing turned upside down because of this idea that again,</p>
<p>ambitious people want to be managers and managers don&rsquo;t do the real work.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s like cowboys who don&rsquo;t know how to ride horses. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dangerous precedent to set. What are your takeaways Chamath from what happened at Facebook</p>
<p>when you look at it and the pressure that was put on the ripping of the stock, even though they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>down 2% year over year in terms of advertising revenue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy on my team sent me this chart. He did a pretty detailed</p>
<p>technical analysis of Facebook. Nick, can you please put that image up there. So basically,</p>
<p>this shows</p>
<p>This is really technical.</p>
<p>This is the first time Facebook mentioned the word metaverse in q2 of 21. On the earnings call,</p>
<p>they mentioned it 20 times. And the gray line here is a stock price. So as they kept mentioning</p>
<p>it, the stock price just, you know, react. But q q4 of 22 was the first time that the word</p>
<p>efficiency exceeded the word metaverse. And you saw and you saw the stock price rip up. So what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened at Facebook is really interesting, because I think it transitioned to what&rsquo;s generally called</p>
<p>an X growth company, which means that people are now looking at a business that has essentially</p>
<p>gotten to its peak size. And now what they&rsquo;re looking at is its ability to generate cash flow,</p>
<p>the cash flow generation or cash flow yield of the business was like three and a half percent.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re making enormous cuts, both in capex as well as headcount over time, they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>their expenses under control. And all of that should drive up their cash free cash flow yield.</p>
<p>And so I think why people got very excited is there are very few x growth stocks that you can</p>
<p>own, that can just compound and crunch ginormous amounts of money. And these guys are in an</p>
<p>incredible position to do it, you know, more than 100 plus billion dollars of revenue. And if you</p>
<p>get these costs under control and get efficient, get the employee base down to 30 or 40,000 over</p>
<p>time, this is a thing that just spits out just ginormous amounts of cash. And so</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s value investing and Warren Buffett, that means the earnings per share go way up.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, like, like, the Facebook PE is quite modest, actually. Now, I actually</p>
<p>put back in stock based comp, and its PE is about 11. So still reasonable. If you go back to the to</p>
<p>the Ben Graham analysis, this is a company that perfectly meets that criteria of like,</p>
<p>you can buy it at a PE, that&rsquo;s basically two times the risk free rate. And so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an incredible stock now that you can own. Because if they keep grinding out all of these kind of</p>
<p>free cash flow gains, man, they&rsquo;ll just they&rsquo;ll just have enormous amounts of money, they already</p>
<p>announced a $40 billion buyback. You know, the thing to keep in mind is Apple had a moment like</p>
<p>this. And when Apple went x growth, they did the brilliant thing, which is they said, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to borrow heavily. And we&rsquo;re going to return cash. I may have posted this in the group chat to you</p>
<p>guys. By 2025, Apple will have exceeded $1 trillion of cash distributions. I mean, that is just nuts.</p>
<p>Is that include buybacks in cash distributions,</p>
<p>buybacks and dividends. And so Facebook now you can credibly see a path where Facebook could</p>
<p>chunk out hundreds of billions of dollars of, of total shareholder value returned over the</p>
<p>next four or five years. And so, you know, for value investors, it&rsquo;s somewhat of a kind of a</p>
<p>no brainer. I mean, nothing&rsquo;s a no brainer, but yeah, really, really attractive value fundamentals</p>
<p>right now. I mean, you did see Warren Buffett buying Apple, I think it&rsquo;s his largest position,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see him probably do the same with Facebook. There was an interesting mass extinction</p>
<p>event tweet that went on that&rsquo;s related to all of this Tom Loverio, a GP general partner at IVP,</p>
<p>which is a venture firm tweeted the following thread, there is a mass extinction event coming</p>
<p>for early and mid stage companies late 23 and 24. But make the 2008 financial crisis look quaint</p>
<p>for startups below I explain when, how and why. And we&rsquo;ll start to offer some detailed advice,</p>
<p>basically four and five, four in five early stage startups, he claims have less than 12 months of</p>
<p>runway, according to a Q4 survey of 450 founders by January ventures. He sees late 2324 when this</p>
<p>will all come home to roost Mark Suster from upfront ventures, friend of the pod reply with</p>
<p>the following precisely our internal analysis 5000 seed 2.5 million raised or above a and b</p>
<p>companies with three different categories funded in the last four years, we estimate 50% will go</p>
<p>out of business. loss ratios in the last seven years have been artificially low due to excess</p>
<p>capital as we just discussed previously with the never ending bridge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before, if you look back over 40 years of venture capital,</p>
<p>the average top core top fund distributes 1.6 or 1.7 x the capital they raise.</p>
<p>Even though now we&rsquo;ve gone through a period where people have shown these</p>
<p>unbelievable markups, right tbp is the total value of paid in capital.</p>
<p>distributions have not really budged that much distributions are still modest, they&rsquo;re below 2x.</p>
<p>And so we have to go through what&rsquo;s called mean reversion, right, we have to go back to the</p>
<p>historic statistical average, which means that a 50 to 60% mortality rate seems pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>By the way, in the.com bubble, that&rsquo;s what we went through, you know, in 2001 to 2005,</p>
<p>we had a 50% mortality rate at the seed stage. I mean, you kind of expect 70% to go out series a</p>
<p>maybe a little bit less free, but what are you seeing on the streets? You&rsquo;re investing in</p>
<p>startups? Yeah, look, I think that there&rsquo;s is there an opportunity, by the way, also in here?</p>
<p>So what are you seeing? But is there an opportunity in this group of this cohort of companies, which</p>
<p>seem to be upside down and or in a tsunami right now, this cohort of companies, I think,</p>
<p>generally, is overburdened with feature orientation and short term ism more than you would see in an</p>
<p>era of reduced capital rather than excess capital. And what I mean by that is a lot of companies</p>
<p>built a business or built a product that allowed them to show traction in the market faster.</p>
<p>And typically, those products that are easier kind of paths to market end up being features,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t end up being platforms. So it&rsquo;s very hard to become a big business or to become a</p>
<p>scaling business, or to differentiate in a competitive market. That&rsquo;s a generalized,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very general statement. But I think, you know, when you miss out on the platform play,</p>
<p>you start betting as an investor on a lot of the derivative plays that look like the real big</p>
<p>company look like the platform. I mean, think about how many companies try to look like some</p>
<p>iteration of Stripe, or tried to look like some iteration of Uber, or tried to look like some</p>
<p>iteration of, you know, name your big kind of behemoth. And as a result, you get all these</p>
<p>sort of feature ish platform plays that have maybe a niche, or some kind of, you know, narrow kind of</p>
<p>market opportunity, they got funded, those those businesses obviously aren&rsquo;t going to have the same</p>
<p>valuation multiples of the winners in the market. And now, and they burnt a lot of money to</p>
<p>demonstrate growth, because so much of investing over the last 15 years has been momentum investing.</p>
<p>And so they try to grow, then they try to get a higher valuation, investors plan more money in.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is that so many of these series BCD and E companies have a true market value.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a valueless company. But the true market value of them is probably less than the</p>
<p>total preference stack of the capital that&rsquo;s gone in. So there&rsquo;s a way let me Yeah, let me</p>
<p>just make sure people understand. I&rsquo;ll just describe it. Yeah. So when investors invest,</p>
<p>they have preferred stock, so they have a right to get their money back. So they let&rsquo;s say a 1x</p>
<p>liquidation preference, they invest $100 million. The company is worth 300. So they own 25% of the</p>
<p>company after they invest, but they have a right to that $100 million. First, before common</p>
<p>shareholders get paid. The problem now is that a lot of those companies may be worth less than 100.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not worth 400 anymore, they&rsquo;re worth 100. And you can see this play out in the public</p>
<p>markets with that that data set I shared with you guys a few weeks ago, over two thirds of</p>
<p>companies now that have gone public since 2020 are worth less than the capital that they have</p>
<p>raised as in the venture market. So if they were still private, they would be worth less than their</p>
<p>preference stack. And that&rsquo;s where these companies start to unravel. Because now the investors have</p>
<p>to totally recap the company, the founders don&rsquo;t want to have all of their common wiped out now</p>
<p>they own nothing. And there ends up being a very ugly scenario that happens with the board at that</p>
<p>point on how do we wind this thing down? How do we recap it? What&rsquo;s going to happen? And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually where everyone starts to run for the hills, the founders one or more of the founders</p>
<p>leave and so on. I have a question for you. So you mentioned this earlier, which I think was a</p>
<p>really important point, but we didn&rsquo;t really touch it. Do you think there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a reckoning inside of venture firms about recalibrating general partners?</p>
<p>100% I mean, look, and why sorry, just explain why. Yeah. So I think what&rsquo;s happened is over</p>
<p>the last 15 years to become a successful venture investor, you&rsquo;ve gotten into the hot deals,</p>
<p>the deals were and hot deals, the valuations are typically climbing up. And, you know, when the</p>
<p>valuations climb up, that&rsquo;s an indicator that the company is doing well, and you should invest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the model for operating in the last 15 years. But the truth is that maybe just because</p>
<p>the valuations have gone up, and more money has gone in doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great business, or as Jamal points out, that you ultimately get a positive net return on that</p>
<p>investment down the road, and that windows now closed. So the the investors that have been</p>
<p>trained jet, this is such a generalization. And I hate saying it because we have so many</p>
<p>good smart friends that work in venture. But generally speaking, there are a lot of folks</p>
<p>who have come up who have been trained on this momentum investing model. And it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>day trading, the stocks are going up, let&rsquo;s all put money into the stock going up. Instead of</p>
<p>having a more fundamental approach to is there real cash generation potential and scalability</p>
<p>and platform ability of this company. And as a result, you&rsquo;re going to have to see I think the</p>
<p>junior partners that have come up and done well in this market.</p>
<p>Can I build on your point?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;ve, they&rsquo;ve done well on paper, but they haven&rsquo;t done well on distribution. So</p>
<p>maybe that Chamath becomes the well, so you decide who&rsquo;s a good venture capitalist, which of these</p>
<p>companies actually returned capital at a peak market?</p>
<p>Well, I think Freeberg is really onto something. And he mentioned this before. So I got curious</p>
<p>about this. And I went into pitch book. And my team and I looked at all of the people,</p>
<p>the humans in our business, that have generated more than a billion dollars in distributions on</p>
<p>a given deal. And there&rsquo;s 20 that have done that in our industry. Like, there&rsquo;s people that have</p>
<p>made hundreds of millions of dollars once or twice, but there&rsquo;s 20 people that have made more than a</p>
<p>billion dollars more than once, okay. And if you look at a single one came up through the ranks as</p>
<p>a pure engineer or product manager, right, everybody to a one is extremely commercial in</p>
<p>their background and their operating experience. Very few percentages of them were actually</p>
<p>founders, a huge percentage of them were trained in banks and other places. So non traditional,</p>
<p>quote, unquote roles for what this current crop of GPS look like, because we went through a phase</p>
<p>where if you were a VP of product, or a VP of design, or a VP of engineering at a well known</p>
<p>startup, that was the most obvious onboarding into a venture firm. But if you just look back at the</p>
<p>data, that cohort of people has actually never made money, again, according to pitch book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really fascinating counterintuitive takeaway, which is that, and by the way, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so interesting about that is Pat Grady, I think had a tweet, and it just sums it up so cleanly,</p>
<p>because he just hired somebody from CO2. And the tweet was something to the effect of this guy</p>
<p>is the most commercial guy we&rsquo;ve ever seen something like that. And I thought that was</p>
<p>so interesting, because that is exactly what our heuristical analysis of this data was as well.</p>
<p>Commercial people in venture are the ones that make the money.</p>
<p>So you look at a Fred Wilson, Michael Moritz, Danny,</p>
<p>Bill Gurley, they were investment analysts, I can share your list markets before they</p>
<p>became venture investors, or Mike Moritz, who was a who was a journalist,</p>
<p>which is a journalist is just an analyst. It&rsquo;s another if you&rsquo;re a good journalist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another word for analyst. Yeah,</p>
<p>it was really, really interesting looking at that list. So like, you know, there are people in</p>
<p>there like Jim Getz, Alfred Lynn, Danny Reimer, Jan hammer, Fenton. So if you look at all of</p>
<p>these folks that are just tier one people, and we know all of them, the one common thread amongst</p>
<p>all those folks is that unbelievably commercial and so Jason in a in a moment like this, where</p>
<p>you have to really hold the entrepreneurs feet to the fire or be their partner to make extremely</p>
<p>hard decisions, you have to have the ability to be respected by them in those moments where you can</p>
<p>force a very difficult decision. And then separately, if you have to basically force</p>
<p>liquidity so that you prioritize your limited partners, how do you do that while still managing</p>
<p>the relationship with the entrepreneur? How do you know that you just need to cut your losses</p>
<p>and get out? These are very difficult trade offs that I think folks haven&rsquo;t been trained in doing</p>
<p>to David&rsquo;s point. So it&rsquo;ll be really interesting few years to see how these organizations</p>
<p>I think this goes, this goes to sax&rsquo;s point about, hey, the ecosystem, if it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s cantankerous, if there&rsquo;s sand in the oyster, it could make the pearl.</p>
<p>If you have a, you know, a congenial relationship with, you know, your product manager, VC and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s champagne and caviar and and high fiving, maybe that&rsquo;s not as good as having a</p>
<p>Bill Gurley, a Michael Moritz and having a foil maybe who is putting pressure on the management</p>
<p>team, hey, we need to hit these numbers, freeberg and then sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think one one counter argument here may be that there is this friggin title wave</p>
<p>of AI companies. And there is this incredible amount of lubricant in the dry powder that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sitting on the side of the, of the market right now that all these venture funds raised in the</p>
<p>last two years, that is going to lubricate all these AI companies into every vertical in every</p>
<p>market. So every company is wrapped up in an AI cloak, like a magic invisibility cloak, every</p>
<p>AI company has got an AI hat and a badge and a tattoo now or every company is being rewritten</p>
<p>as an AI company. And the money wants to find its way into AI and it wants to rewrite industry with</p>
<p>every industry with AI. So I think similar to what we saw with mobile, and the social web,</p>
<p>you know, going back 10 or 15 years, we&rsquo;re seeing kind of this AI wrapper and this AI technology</p>
<p>enabler, rewrite the possibility of every vertical, and the VCs have capital more capital</p>
<p>than they had 15 years ago, or 10 years ago, or even seven years ago. So there is this counter</p>
<p>narrative, which may be that the game, the game goes on, the band continues to march on the current</p>
<p>crop dies out. But there&rsquo;s immediately a new crop waiting right behind it. Or what happens is the</p>
<p>herd dies, and everyone runs to the back of the right and gets recapitalized. Because I can tell</p>
<p>you every startup I know that&rsquo;s not going well, everyone&rsquo;s talking about leaving to go do an AI</p>
<p>company. And I think they&rsquo;re ready to write money. I think you&rsquo;re I think you&rsquo;re right about</p>
<p>that. I think the question is, the actual person making the check, will they be more or less likely</p>
<p>and at least what history would tell you is that we&rsquo;ve hired an entire generation of people</p>
<p>that and this is clear do not map to the people in our industry that have actually generated</p>
<p>returns. So you&rsquo;re right, they may take this money and misallocated into these companies</p>
<p>that are just, you know, rebranding themselves. But that just goes and further proves that there</p>
<p>is a type of person that hasn&rsquo;t been recruited into these venture firms yet. That was the first</p>
<p>generation that made all the money. I think it&rsquo;s always been the case that there is some difference</p>
<p>between the background of the VCs and the backgrounds of founders. I mean, you guys</p>
<p>mentioned Gurley and Moritz, like we said, Moritz was a journalist who had written a book about</p>
<p>Apple. He wasn&rsquo;t technical per se. And Gurley was a investment analyst on Wall Street before</p>
<p>he then made the transition into VC. And as we both know, they&rsquo;re like legendary VCs.</p>
<p>You know, I think the what you want to see in a VC, I think the background matters a little bit</p>
<p>less than, you know, like, how curious are they? How good are they about learning a new area? How</p>
<p>good are they at being like a heat seeking missile? I mean, basically, just like zeroing in on,</p>
<p>like, what is the hot space? And specifically, what is the best company within that space,</p>
<p>and somehow figuring that out, being able to assess a founder, you know, that&rsquo;s like a very</p>
<p>subjective thing. So I think there&rsquo;s lots of qualifications that you want to see in a VC.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time, I do think that if AI is the next wave, and the next sort of platform</p>
<p>opportunity, as we all think it is, I do think that places more of an emphasis on technical</p>
<p>skills. And I was, I was literally just having this conversation at craft that, gee, maybe the</p>
<p>next hire, we should make a craft should be someone who&rsquo;s really deep technically. So they</p>
<p>can, you know, help go deeper on technical due diligence of AI companies, they&rsquo;ve never made</p>
<p>money. What&rsquo;s that? They&rsquo;ve never made money in the history of our business, who those people,</p>
<p>that archetype of hire has never done that on behalf of well, he&rsquo;s in biotech and life sciences,</p>
<p>they have the best investors usually saying he&rsquo;s saying a technical hire who worked in the trenches</p>
<p>at a company is not as fit. No, has not in the past has not in the past gotten DPI. Whereas</p>
<p>somebody who is more commercial to analyze a business, the ideal person is going to be able</p>
<p>to get returns. Right, right. So look, I think, you know, the ideal person would be someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>formerly a great investor, but also has some technical background and some technical chops.</p>
<p>We also have a team approach at craft. So if you have someone who&rsquo;s very technical, they can just</p>
<p>diligence the technical aspects of the deal. Somebody else can be responsible for, you know,</p>
<p>making an assessment of the founders, how we&rsquo;ve solved this is we have a group of third party</p>
<p>individuals that we work with, that we keep on retainer that we compensate. And whenever we need</p>
<p>to do deep technical diligence, we partner with them to do that work with us. And what it allows</p>
<p>us to do is get the best of their technical thinking, without also putting them in a</p>
<p>position of trying to adjudicate whether this company is good or not. What I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>understand is, what is this technical edge? And can I understand the boundaries of that,</p>
<p>but I still keep the investment decision to myself and my partners, because otherwise,</p>
<p>the difficulty is, in my experience, deeply, deeply technical people are extremely good at</p>
<p>diligence, but generally are poor at making investment decisions, because there&rsquo;s a part</p>
<p>of their brain that flips on, which is like, I could do it better, or I could do it this way,</p>
<p>or I could do it that way. And I think like that anchoring bias can be very dangerous. And you</p>
<p>almost want to be a little dumbed down from that depth of knowledge, because you either find</p>
<p>everything that is like not worth doing, and then you can miss a market. Or you miss the thing that</p>
<p>is good enough, because you&rsquo;re like, Oh, well, I would have done x, y, and z in a different way.</p>
<p>So we kind of like use them, but we keep them at arm&rsquo;s length so that they never feel the pressure</p>
<p>of having to actually decide on our behalf, how the money should be spent. Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, the number one thing we&rsquo;re doing at this early stage is training our founders,</p>
<p>I know this sounds crazy, on accounting best practices, and pricing best practices. And</p>
<p>we literally have founders who have never made a plan I&rsquo;m talking about at the seed stage,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know accounting. And so we are running for seed stage startups, and I&rsquo;m kicking myself</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t do it two years ago or three years ago, but better late than never, on how to just</p>
<p>maintain their books and understand operations and the the operational lack of discipline in</p>
<p>the market. I&rsquo;m seeing series A and series B companies that literally don&rsquo;t understand their</p>
<p>own accounting. And so when we start talking to their accountants, there is a huge gap between</p>
<p>what the accountants think of this business and what the founders think of these businesses.</p>
<p>And founders think they have more revenue than they have or less revenue. They&rsquo;re really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know how to calculate their runway in an honest way. And so there is back to your point,</p>
<p>Chamath about on the on the venture side of the business, a lot of product focus,</p>
<p>a lot of operational focus, there&rsquo;s not enough focus on just the bottom line.</p>
<p>The reason that happened is what Friedberg said before, which is like somebody would build</p>
<p>something, there was a little bit of momentum. And you&rsquo;d have to go and present these bona fides</p>
<p>to these entrepreneurs to get into the deal. And so vent what venture firms thought was the right</p>
<p>bona fide to present as oh, I built XYZ product at this other company, right? And they thought</p>
<p>that that edge could get you into a deal, maybe, but it could turn out that that was the wrong</p>
<p>company to be in in the first place. And so you just missed an entire generation of value creation</p>
<p>because it happened sort of off piste off the trail. Like, yeah, you really do need to understand</p>
<p>fundamentally, because we&rsquo;re talking about public markets here, the Facebook analogy,</p>
<p>what is the ultimate earnings? What is the ultimate cash that is going to get thrown off</p>
<p>this business? And that&rsquo;s what the whole industry needs to, I think, pivot to and just that needs to</p>
<p>be the operating principle. You guys know how much money Facebook, Amazon, Google and Microsoft</p>
<p>raised combined total before they went public. That&rsquo;s very small. I mean, Google is minuscule,</p>
<p>less than a quarter billion dollars. Unbelievable. Yeah. All the inefficiency is extraordinary. And</p>
<p>then on top of this inefficiency, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re seeing this, they were all profitable</p>
<p>when they went public. On top of all this inefficiency is a dependence on venture debt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re seeing this sacks, but the amount of focus on adding debt to</p>
<p>unprofitable companies over the last five years has been just extraordinary. I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood the venture debt model or really how it works. I feel like it&rsquo;s a category</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Say more. I mean, well, I mean, explain it to people what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand how it makes sense for lenders or for founders. To be honest,</p>
<p>I think the whole industry doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. For founders, I don&rsquo;t like it because</p>
<p>the money has to be paid back, right? It&rsquo;s debt. So founders take in this venture debt,</p>
<p>thinking like it&rsquo;s an equity round, but without dilution with some warrants. And they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize, well, wait a second, we got to pay this back in a year or a year and a half out of the</p>
<p>next round they do. But that creates an overhang on the next round because the new VCs coming in,</p>
<p>they want their money to go into the company, not paying off a bank. So it actually makes the next</p>
<p>round less attractive. The other thing about it is that the lender is not getting an equity reward,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t want to take equity risk. They may be getting a nice</p>
<p>coupon. They might be getting 9% or something like that, which sounds high for debt, but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>taking true equity risk in the company. So the last thing they want to do is be your last six</p>
<p>months of runway, right? They want to be your first six months of runway and then get paid off</p>
<p>on the back end. And I think a lot of founders think, oh, well, I&rsquo;ll take this money and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>extend my runway from 18 months to two years. But what will happen in that last six months is all</p>
<p>of a sudden the bank will come to you and say, no, no, no, no. You have this or that material</p>
<p>adverse condition. It&rsquo;s called a Mac out. And there&rsquo;s all these terms that founders don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand because it&rsquo;s highly legalistic. Covenants, yeah.</p>
<p>Covenants. And so all of a sudden, the founders find themselves with a lot less flexibility</p>
<p>in that last six months to a year. Either a covenant gets triggered that makes them pay</p>
<p>back the money immediately, or their business flexibility goes way down because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consulting with their bank about everything. All of this is coming home to roost right now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a terrible deal for founders. And I think that even for the lenders, I mean,</p>
<p>I guess I assume that these banks know their business better than I do, but</p>
<p>I think that the reason I don&rsquo;t trust it as a category from a lender point of view or from</p>
<p>an investor point of view is that all the data about defaults over the last five to 10 years</p>
<p>happened in this free-flowing zero interest rate environment. And so the startup mortality rates</p>
<p>were artificially low because it was so easy to raise. So yeah, venture debt makes sense in an</p>
<p>environment in which founders are generally able to raise the next round and then pay back the</p>
<p>venture debt. But let&rsquo;s say that that tweet storm you mentioned, Jason, can you bring that back on</p>
<p>the screen? I actually think this tweet storm is basically correct. I&rsquo;ve referred to on this show</p>
<p>before that I think one of the things that built up during this bubble is latent startup mortality.</p>
<p>So many startups that should have died from not being able to raise next round</p>
<p>live because they&rsquo;re able to raise money. And what this tweet storm is predicting is that</p>
<p>the second half of 2023 and then 24, you&rsquo;re going to have a huge crunch where all these companies</p>
<p>have to go out and raise, they&rsquo;ve been waiting. So they&rsquo;re all going to get to the point where</p>
<p>their cash is so low, they have to go out and raise. And now all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be confronted with the new market conditions. I wonder how many of them have venture debt as an</p>
<p>overhang. And those ones, yeah. And they&rsquo;re going to find they have less runway than they thought,</p>
<p>because again, those banks, they are going to try and collect the debt before the startup</p>
<p>runs out of money, not when it runs out of money. Catch two falling knives, basically.</p>
<p>Exactly. So, look, I just wonder, what I don&rsquo;t trust is whether the return models on venture</p>
<p>debt that were created over the last five to 10 years will be a good predictor of what the returns</p>
<p>will be in the next five, 10 years, when a lot of the mortality that should have happened in the</p>
<p>past now happens in the future. I mean, then, and Sachs, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also starting to see really gnarly term sheets, people foreclosing on businesses,</p>
<p>people offering, like literally had a term sheet come in, like, we&rsquo;re going to forgive the last</p>
<p>note and take this business over for $1. And everybody gets wiped out. The amount of bad</p>
<p>feelings that you have to go through, even if there is a core business to freebirds point</p>
<p>earlier, hey, they raised 100 million, but there&rsquo;s a $50 million business in here that people would</p>
<p>love to invest in, who wants to go through the hand wringing the negotiation, the toxicity</p>
<p>of a recap. It&rsquo;s an extremely hard process to go through. Are you going through any recaps right</p>
<p>now, Sachs? And what is the, what is the approach of the firm in terms of dealing with these kinds</p>
<p>of situations? Do you even want to start that discussion up? Or is it too painful?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think for most of our companies, we&rsquo;re at the recap or restructuring stage. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the ones that aren&rsquo;t going well, people still have a fair amount of cash</p>
<p>in the bank. And we&rsquo;ve been beating the drums for literally a year.</p>
<p>What about new opportunities and new opportunity comes to you, it&rsquo;s one of these overhang companies</p>
<p>that wants to restructure, would you even engage that? Or is it just too hard?</p>
<p>I looked at seven at the end of last year, and I tried to reprice three of them.</p>
<p>And every single one was able to get a convert done away from us.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>we tried to find a market clearing price for this equity, but nobody wants it to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too much money on the sideline. And people are willing to give them a lifeline</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t force them to come to hard terms with what the reality of the moment is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that. We&rsquo;re not quite there yet. And I think the reason why that that tweet</p>
<p>you posted, got some traction is it&rsquo;s saying, listen, the crunch is going to happen second</p>
<p>half of 2023 and 2024. That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to see the down rounds. That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see the restructuring, the recaps, and all the rest of it. And look, I&rsquo;m sure like every VC firm</p>
<p>is going to be a player in that. But yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be a lot of miserable work.</p>
<p>This is when you&rsquo;re going to see people&rsquo;s true colors when when when you have to recap a company.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s when you can really start to see how crappy it was in 2003 to be here.</p>
<p>Remember 2003?</p>
<p>Painful.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was lucky to raise 500k on a $3 million.</p>
<p>Oh my god, like 2004. Like what a brutal year.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of that. I think the next 18 months,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say the next two years, there&rsquo;s gonna be pretty rough for a lot of companies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just that they didn&rsquo;t cut enough. I mean, we&rsquo;ve been beating on the drums for a year</p>
<p>for companies to length of their runway. And some did to some extent, but many didn&rsquo;t do enough,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to get caught in this crunch. Can we just go to that chart that Brad put out?</p>
<p>I think that what a lot of founders don&rsquo;t quite understand still, is that things are just never</p>
<p>going back to 2021. I think a lot of founders listening to the top of the show, where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about inflation is under control, they see the market rally, Facebook&rsquo;s up 25%, they may be</p>
<p>thinking, okay, we just have to weather the storm for six months or a year, and then everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back to normal. And I think what&rsquo;s important to understand is that the market did bottom out about</p>
<p>a month ago, and is up pretty nicely. If you see here, this is the SAS index, it&rsquo;s the median</p>
<p>enterprise value divided by next 12 months revenue. And it was really beaten down about</p>
<p>at the end of the year, at the end of last year, coming into this year. Yeah, it was like,</p>
<p>it was like four to five X multiples of next 12 months revenue for SAS companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the way up to 6.1 now. So, you&rsquo;re talking about 20% to 50% rally for a lot of</p>
<p>companies, which is huge. We&rsquo;re still below the long-term median, which is just under eight.</p>
<p>Okay. But what people need to understand is that even if we revert all the way to the mean</p>
<p>of eight, which I think at some point we will, that&rsquo;s still well below the bubble of 21,</p>
<p>where they got to 16. So, even if things continue to inflate, valuations will still</p>
<p>never quite be where they were in 2021. And if you think it&rsquo;s getting back to 12,</p>
<p>or 16, it&rsquo;s not happening. For high growth companies, for high growth companies,</p>
<p>in 2021, you were in the public markets, you were seeing multiples of 30 to 35 times.</p>
<p>Now those companies are maybe at eight to 10, or 12.</p>
<p>I think the reliable way that we can look at this for the future is that we&rsquo;re never going to see</p>
<p>these kinds of multiples again, unless rates are zero, and all kinds of tourist capital</p>
<p>need to find a home to escape 0% returns in every other asset class. But if even the</p>
<p>safest asset class now will give you three and a half, 4%, this is probably the new normal for</p>
<p>quite a long time. And we&rsquo;re going to be back in that early 2000s kind of mindset, which takes</p>
<p>a lot of hard work to build value around.</p>
<p>We talked about the sort of whipsaw economy. And there&rsquo;s a lot of mixed inflation data.</p>
<p>I think founders need to understand that there&rsquo;s a bifurcation, what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the tech ecosystem is not necessarily what&rsquo;s happening in the overall economy.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem is clearly going through a reset and a recession. Job cuts are now the rule,</p>
<p>valuations are much lower. Whereas in the overall economy, we saw a job support</p>
<p>today of over 500,000 new jobs. So the fact of the matter is that even if the overall economy</p>
<p>avoids a recession, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that things are just going to bounce back.</p>
<p>Tech is a depression slash recession. Best case is recession.</p>
<p>Tech is a boom bust cycle. And we had a phenomenal 10 years of boom. Now we&rsquo;re in a bust.</p>
<p>And so I would just like tell founders, you know, look, it&rsquo;s good if we have a soft landing</p>
<p>in the economy, I wouldn&rsquo;t assume that that&rsquo;s going to happen. I still think there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good chance of recession later this year. But it almost doesn&rsquo;t matter for you. What matters</p>
<p>is your business and the capital availability for startups, which is fundamentally different</p>
<p>and will remain different than it was in 2021. Freiburg, you were talking in the chat about</p>
<p>Donnie enterprises and Hindenburg doing the short research and publishing it.</p>
<p>Stock has just absolutely gotten clobbered. They were trading at gosh, 4100 was the</p>
<p>52 week high, and this thing has just cratered in the last five days.</p>
<p>I mean, I think explain what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the story that the conversation I thought it would be interesting for us to have</p>
<p>is the role that these short seller research analysts play in driving efficient markets by</p>
<p>identifying perhaps things that the market broadly is missing. Particularly, given that a few weeks</p>
<p>ago, we were all kind of talking about the FTX debacle, and how no one was doing their diligence</p>
<p>and no one was digging in and no one was kind of revealing publicly what was going on inside of</p>
<p>that business that ultimately caused significant losses. You know, the claims made by Hindenburg</p>
<p>is that this company Adani, which is founded and run by a guy named Gautam Adani. He started the</p>
<p>company like I think 3035 years ago, and he&rsquo;s built this thing into this, you know, the sprawling</p>
<p>empire, as people would say, where he&rsquo;s owns ports, he owns mining companies, he owns energy</p>
<p>transmission businesses, he&rsquo;s got a whole green energy business. And he&rsquo;s taken a bunch of these</p>
<p>companies, and he&rsquo;s floated them publicly. So they&rsquo;re all kind of publicly traded. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>degree of interrelatedness between all these businesses. It reminds me a lot of I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>if any of you guys remember, I keep a Tista out of Brazil. You guys remember this guy, where, you</p>
<p>know, he kind of built the sprawling empire, very kind of broadly diversified industrial conglomerate</p>
<p>with, you know, lots of different kind of segments and used a lot of leverage, a lot of debt to grow</p>
<p>the business, and a lot of interrelated inter party transactions. And ultimately, the whole</p>
<p>thing kind of came crashing down. And that this Adani business, it&rsquo;s super technical and super</p>
<p>complicated, all the kind of accounting shenanigans that Hindenburg is claiming has been going on,</p>
<p>and capital markets shenanigans that they&rsquo;re claiming have been going on with this business,</p>
<p>but their kind of report, which I think is like 400 pages long, has caused the responses for pages,</p>
<p>their responses long to get the markets shrugged off the response that he put out, didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>care. And they kept kept selling the stocks off. So it&rsquo;s like seven or eight publicly traded</p>
<p>companies, all of which are just getting decimated. Look, I don&rsquo;t have any strong opinion on this</p>
<p>business. I you know, I kind of skimmed through the thing. But you know, it really made me question</p>
<p>like how such a big call it accounting or capital markets fraud if it really is that can go on,</p>
<p>and how much of a role these sorts of players play in the market, whether you guys think that</p>
<p>this is a good thing in the market to have these short seller reporters out there, you know, doing</p>
<p>this analysis publishing it, Jason, by the way, you called out Nick Nicola, Nicola, the electric</p>
<p>car company, as you know, Hindenburg put out that Nicola report, not tanked, right, they claimed it</p>
<p>was all fraud, etc. And then the thing got destroyed was Trevor Milton got convicted.</p>
<p>Right. And so I mean, I guess, do you guys think that these guys have a have a positive role net</p>
<p>net in the market, in kind of identifying and calling out this stuff, because we all have</p>
<p>friends that are on the wrong side of short sellers, and they complain about it. And it can</p>
<p>be really difficult to grow and build a business when people Ilan had these guys literally claiming</p>
<p>he was running a fraud for years and years. And it was an intense amount of scrutiny. Because when</p>
<p>the trap when the stock was less trafficked in when we were in it in 2015, and 16 and 17. That</p>
<p>was the constant reframe and Ilan was constantly batting back folks like this, who would make</p>
<p>claims. And the way that these guys are allowed to operate is because they use the First Amendment</p>
<p>and say we have the right to say this stuff. I think that shorting falls into two buckets. One</p>
<p>is you use it as a hedging instrument. So when we talk about spread trades, like long Google,</p>
<p>short Facebook, or long Facebook, short Google, you should be allowed to short I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very reasonable thing to do. I think the the question is, if you were on the inside of a</p>
<p>company and you say XYZ is happening, for example, Trevor Milton, and it causes the stock to go up,</p>
<p>and it turns out to be fraudulent, he&rsquo;s held accountable. The question is, should there be</p>
<p>the same responsibility for people on the outside, who if they have enough distribution, can say the</p>
<p>exact opposite of XYZ is happening. In this case, XYZ is not happening, which then causes the stock</p>
<p>to go down. Because what the business model of these short sellers is, write a document,</p>
<p>it looks very polished and very credible, put on some positions, then put the document out.</p>
<p>If the stock goes down, you close it out. In my opinion, I think that short sellers are really</p>
<p>important part of a well functioning market or the ability to short. But what I would like to do is</p>
<p>take an extra step, which is, you should hold these folks accountable the same way you&rsquo;d hold</p>
<p>an insider accountable, which is almost to the effect of like, when you put out this screed,</p>
<p>if you make money from it, it should sit in escrow, and the SEC should actually adjudicate</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s true or not. So in the case of Hindenburg and Nikola, they shorted the stock,</p>
<p>they put out a report, it turned out they were right, all that money is completely well earned.</p>
<p>Now, what if this Adani thing turns out to be not true, or true, nobody knows right now, except 50%</p>
<p>of the market cap has already been wiped out. So that&rsquo;s where things I think are, are in a bit of</p>
<p>a gray area. The last thing I&rsquo;ll say is that if you look at in the developing world, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very gray line between some of the leading entrepreneurs in these governments, because</p>
<p>these entrepreneurs are doing the work of some of these governments, whether it&rsquo;s I keep a Tista</p>
<p>in Brazil in one moment, right around natural resources, or Adani and Ambani in India, or a lot</p>
<p>of the people that have made a lot of money in China, or the people that are making money and</p>
<p>in developing markets, Turkey, Russia, etc. The government uses very talented entrepreneurs to go</p>
<p>and concentrate capital to develop infrastructure progress. We did that in America in the 1800s as</p>
<p>well. So that&rsquo;s where I think, you know, you have to also balance it because his response was</p>
<p>basically like this is an attack on India. And in a way, you can see where he&rsquo;s coming from,</p>
<p>right? Because he&rsquo;s building ports and roads and bridges. And he&rsquo;s like, without this stuff,</p>
<p>how is India supposed to even exist in the 21st century? That&rsquo;s a reasonable claim. So I agree</p>
<p>with you, Friedberg. I don&rsquo;t know whether the report is right or not. But this extra step of</p>
<p>actually having the SEC actually tell us what the answer is, I think would be a very important</p>
<p>improvement to how this kind of stuff works. The other improvement that the SEC has been</p>
<p>proposing in rule 13 F dash two, is that people would need to disclose their short positions,</p>
<p>this proposed rule would require institutional investment managers, I&rsquo;m reading from the SEC</p>
<p>website managers exercising investment discretion over short positions, meaning specific,</p>
<p>specified thresholds to report on the proposed form SHO information related to end of month</p>
<p>short positions and certain data. That is a no brainer, that should absolutely pass.</p>
<p>aggregate the resulting data by security, thereby maintaining thereby maintaining</p>
<p>confidentially of the reporting managers. Yeah. And publicly disseminating the data</p>
<p>to all investors, this new data would supplement the short sell data.</p>
<p>I think this relates to overlanding of stock, right? I mean, this is less about like, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing what, and it&rsquo;s much more about, are we kind of creating critical fail points in the system</p>
<p>by seeing over leverage and over lending in certain</p>
<p>well, there should also be some rules about the spreading of fear, uncertainty and doubt that</p>
<p>that happened with Tesla q, I mean, paradoxically, you know, thousands of</p>
<p>know, but people that but that&rsquo;s an anonymous accounts, you know, that&rsquo;s an example of people</p>
<p>essentially lying in public, yes, try to get the stock to move. And Tesla&rsquo;s not a fraud. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>real company. I mean, there was a car of the year while this was going on. But there was a real</p>
<p>delivery to that company, right to employees that got spooked to partners that may have gotten</p>
<p>the pressure, you know, we saw this the pressure on Elon in those periods of time. And he was,</p>
<p>he was like on the knife&rsquo;s edge, where there was the potential where the company may not have been</p>
<p>able to finance its cash flow needs because of those Tesla q guys. And so it&rsquo;s not to say that</p>
<p>the Tesla q guys can&rsquo;t say it. But they should be forced at some level to prove it. If you can</p>
<p>create crazy stuff. I posted a link by the way, for anybody that&rsquo;s interested in reading this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person called Carson block who&rsquo;s being investigated. Yes, because he may have pushed the</p>
<p>boundaries of how short sellers do this. It&rsquo;s a really fascinating read in the Atlantic for</p>
<p>anybody who wants to read it. But this is sort of where the short selling thing can a little bit go</p>
<p>awry. And it&rsquo;s the title of this is the man who moves markets. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite a quite a</p>
<p>really interesting read if you&rsquo;re interested in in how all of this stuff works. All right,</p>
<p>everybody, that&rsquo;s the all in podcast for February, third and fourth for Saks, Friedberg and Chamath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jake out of the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator. We&rsquo;ll see you next week.</p>
<p>Oh man, we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
