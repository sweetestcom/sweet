    <p>The following is a conversation with David Newman.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the Apollo Program Professor at MIT</p>
<p>and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA</p>
<p>and has been a principal investigator</p>
<p>on four space flight missions.</p>
<p>Her research interests are in aerospace</p>
<p>biomedical engineering, investigating human performance</p>
<p>in varying gravity environments.</p>
<p>She has designed and engineered and built</p>
<p>some incredible space suit technology,</p>
<p>namely the BioSuit that we talk about in this conversation.</p>
<p>Due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts,</p>
<p>we only had about 40 minutes together.</p>
<p>And in true engineering style, she said,</p>
<p>I talk fast, you pick the best questions, let&rsquo;s get it done.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating conversation</p>
<p>about space exploration and the future of spacesuits.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Deva Newman.</p>
<p>You circumnavigated the globe on boat,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s look back in history.</p>
<p>500 years ago, Ferdinand Magellan&rsquo;s crew</p>
<p>was first to circumnavigate the globe,</p>
<p>but he died, which I think people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like halfway through, and so did 242 of the 260 sailors</p>
<p>that took that three year journey.</p>
<p>What do you think it was like for that crew at that time</p>
<p>heading out into the unknown to face probably likely death?</p>
<p>Do you think they were filled with fear, with excitement?</p>
<p>Probably not fear, I think in all of exploration,</p>
<p>the challenge and the unknown, so probably wonderment.</p>
<p>And then just when you really are sailing the world&rsquo;s oceans,</p>
<p>you have extreme weather of all kinds.</p>
<p>When we were circumnavigating, it was challenging,</p>
<p>a new dynamic, you really appreciate Mother Earth,</p>
<p>you appreciate the winds and the waves,</p>
<p>so back to Magellan and his crew,</p>
<p>since they really didn&rsquo;t have a three dimensional map</p>
<p>of the globe, of the Earth when they went out,</p>
<p>just probably looking over the horizon thinking,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s there, what&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>So I would say the challenge that had to be really important</p>
<p>in terms of the team dynamics and that leadership</p>
<p>had to be incredibly important, team dynamics,</p>
<p>how do you keep people focused on the mission?</p>
<p>So you think the psychology, that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably echoes of that in the space exploration</p>
<p>stuff we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>So the psychology of the dynamics between the human beings</p>
<p>on the mission is important?</p>
<p>Absolutely, for a Mars mission, it&rsquo;s lots of challenges,</p>
<p>technology, but since I specialize</p>
<p>in keeping my astronauts alive, the psychosocial issues,</p>
<p>the psychology of psychosocial team dynamics, leadership,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re all people, so that&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always a huge impact, one of the top three,</p>
<p>I think, of any isolated, confined environment,</p>
<p>any mission that is really pretty extreme.</p>
<p>So your Twitter handle is devaexplorer,</p>
<p>so when did you first fall in love with the idea</p>
<p>of exploration?</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s a great question, you know, maybe as long</p>
<p>as I can remember, as I grew up in Montana</p>
<p>in the Rocky Mountains and Helena in the capital,</p>
<p>and so literally, you know, Mount Helena was my backyard,</p>
<p>was right up there, so exploring, being in the mountains,</p>
<p>looking at caves, just running around,</p>
<p>but always being in nature, so since my earliest memories,</p>
<p>I, you know, think of myself as kind of exploring</p>
<p>the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up.</p>
<p>So exploration is not limited to any domain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just anything, so the natural domain of any kind,</p>
<p>so going out to the woods into a place you haven&rsquo;t been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all exploration.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah, I have a pretty all encompassing</p>
<p>definition of exploration.</p>
<p>So what about space exploration?</p>
<p>When were you first captivated by the idea</p>
<p>that we little humans could venture out into the space,</p>
<p>into the great unknown of space?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great year to talk about that,</p>
<p>the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11,</p>
<p>as I was alive during Apollo,</p>
<p>and specifically Apollo 11, I was five years old,</p>
<p>and I distinctly remember that, I remember that humanity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I probably didn&rsquo;t know their names at the time,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,</p>
<p>and never forget Michael Collins in orbit,</p>
<p>you know, those three men, you know,</p>
<p>doing something that just seemed impossible,</p>
<p>seemed impossible a decade earlier, even a year earlier,</p>
<p>but so the Apollo program really inspired me,</p>
<p>and then I think it actually just taught me to dream,</p>
<p>to any impossible mission could be possible</p>
<p>with enough focus, and I&rsquo;m sure you need some luck,</p>
<p>but you definitely need the leadership,</p>
<p>you need the focus of the mission,</p>
<p>so since an early age, I thought,</p>
<p>of course, people, it should be interplanetary,</p>
<p>of course, people, we need people on Earth,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have people exploring space as well.</p>
<p>So that seemed obvious, even at that age, of course.</p>
<p>It opened it up, before we saw men on the moon,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me at all, but once we understood</p>
<p>that yes, absolutely, astronauts, that&rsquo;s what they do,</p>
<p>they explore, they go into space,</p>
<p>and they land on other planets or moons.</p>
<p>So again, maybe a romanticized philosophical question,</p>
<p>but when you look up at the stars,</p>
<p>knowing that, you know, there&rsquo;s at least 100 billion</p>
<p>of them in the Milky Way galaxy, right,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re really a small speck in this giant thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the visible universe,</p>
<p>how does that make you feel about our efforts here?</p>
<p>I love the perspective, I love that perspective,</p>
<p>I always open my public talks</p>
<p>with a big Hubble Space Telescope image,</p>
<p>looking out into, you mentioned just now,</p>
<p>the solar system, the Milky Way,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s really important to know</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just a small, pale, blue dot,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really fortunate, we&rsquo;re on the best planet by far,</p>
<p>life is fantastic here.</p>
<p>That we know of, you&rsquo;re confident</p>
<p>this is the best planet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the best planet,</p>
<p>the best planet that we know of.</p>
<p>I mean, I searched my researches, you know,</p>
<p>in mission worlds, and when will we find life?</p>
<p>I think actually probably the next decade,</p>
<p>we find probably past life,</p>
<p>probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>You think there was once life on Mars,</p>
<p>or do you think there&rsquo;s currently?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago,</p>
<p>feel pretty confident there was life on Mars,</p>
<p>just because then it had an electromagnetic shield,</p>
<p>it had an atmosphere, has wonderful gravity level,</p>
<p>three HGs, fantastic, you know, you&rsquo;re all super human,</p>
<p>we can all slam dunk a basketball,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll find past, no, fossilized,</p>
<p>probably the evidence of past life on Mars.</p>
<p>Currently, that&rsquo;s okay, we need the next decade,</p>
<p>but the evidence is mounting for sure.</p>
<p>We do have the organics, we&rsquo;re finding organics,</p>
<p>we have water, seasonal water on Mars.</p>
<p>We used to just know about the ice caps,</p>
<p>you know, North and South Pole,</p>
<p>now we have seasonal water.</p>
<p>We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.</p>
<p>We really need to dig down into the soil,</p>
<p>because everything on the top surface is radiated,</p>
<p>but once we find down, will we see any life forms?</p>
<p>Will we see any bugs?</p>
<p>I leave it open as a possibility,</p>
<p>but I feel pretty certain that past life,</p>
<p>or fossilized life forms, we&rsquo;ll find.</p>
<p>And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,</p>
<p>these beautiful moons of other planets,</p>
<p>since we know they have water,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking for some simple search for life,</p>
<p>follow the water, carbon based life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only life we know.</p>
<p>There could be other life forms that we don&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to search for them, because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So in our search for life in the solar system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely search, follow the water,</p>
<p>and look for the building blocks of life.</p>
<p>So you think in the next decade,</p>
<p>we might see hints of past life, or even current life?</p>
<p>I think so, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Pretty optimistic.</p>
<p>I love the optimism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty optimistic.</p>
<p>Do humans have to be involved,</p>
<p>or can this be robots and rovers and?</p>
<p>Probably teams, I mean, we&rsquo;ve been at it,</p>
<p>on Mars in particular, 50 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been exploring Mars for 50 years, great data, right?</p>
<p>Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.</p>
<p>Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to know,</p>
<p>because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield.</p>
<p>We know about the water on Mars.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been studying 50 years with our robots,</p>
<p>we still haven&rsquo;t found it.</p>
<p>So I think once we have a human mission there,</p>
<p>we just accelerate things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always humans and our rovers and robots together.</p>
<p>But we just have to think that 50 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been looking at Mars, and taking images,</p>
<p>and doing the best science that we can.</p>
<p>People need to realize Mars is really far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to get to.</p>
<p>You know, this is extreme, extreme exploration.</p>
<p>We mentioned Magellan first,</p>
<p>or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,</p>
<p>which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.</p>
<p>Mars is a different ball game.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s eight months to get there,</p>
<p>year and a half to get home.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really extreme.</p>
<p>The harsh environment in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>But the kind of organisms we might be able to see</p>
<p>hints of on Mars are kind of microorganisms perhaps.</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, and remember that humans,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of, you know, we&rsquo;re hosts, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a big leap</p>
<p>from the viruses and the bacteria to us humans?</p>
<p>Put another way, do you think on all those moons,</p>
<p>beautiful, wet moons that you mentioned,</p>
<p>you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the hope, but you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the scientific evidence for that now.</p>
<p>I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing</p>
<p>is much more compelling again,</p>
<p>because we have the building blocks of life now.</p>
<p>When that life turns into intelligence, that&rsquo;s a big unknown.</p>
<p>If we ever meet,</p>
<p>do you think we would be able to find a common language?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t met yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so far, I mean, do physics just play a role here?</p>
<p>Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.</p>
<p>I mean, even the couple dozen Earth like planets</p>
<p>that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.</p>
<p>These are very Earth like.</p>
<p>They look like they have all the building blocks.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to get there.</p>
<p>The only thing is they&rsquo;re 10 to 100 light years away.</p>
<p>So scientifically, we know they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>We know that they&rsquo;re habitable.</p>
<p>They have, you know, everything going from, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, we call them in the Goldilocks zone,</p>
<p>not too hot, not too cold,</p>
<p>just perfect for habitability for life.</p>
<p>But now the reality is if they&rsquo;re 10 at the best</p>
<p>to 100 to thousands of light years away,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>But I just can&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re not the only ones.</p>
<p>So absolutely life, life in the universe,</p>
<p>probably intelligent life as well.</p>
<p>Do you think there needs to be fundamental revolutions</p>
<p>in how we, the tools we use to travel through space</p>
<p>in order for us to venture outside of our solar system?</p>
<p>Or do you think the ways, the rockets,</p>
<p>the ideas we have now, the engineering ideas we have now</p>
<p>will be enough to venture out?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Right now, you know, cause again, speed of light is a limit.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a warp speed warp drive</p>
<p>to explore our solar system, to get to Mars,</p>
<p>to explore all the planets.</p>
<p>Then we need a technology push,</p>
<p>but technology push here is just advanced propulsion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if I could get humans to Mars</p>
<p>and say, you know, three to four months, not eight months.</p>
<p>I mean, half the time, 50% reduction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great in terms of safety and wellness of the crew.</p>
<p>Orbital mechanic, but physics rules,</p>
<p>you know, orbital mechanics is still there.</p>
<p>Physics rules, we can&rsquo;t defy physics.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So invent a new physics.</p>
<p>I mean, look at quantum, you know,</p>
<p>look at quantum theory.</p>
<p>So you never know.</p>
<p>Exactly, I mean, we are always learning.</p>
<p>So we definitely don&rsquo;t know all the physics that exist too,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re, we still have to, it&rsquo;s not science fiction.</p>
<p>You know, we still have to pay attention to physics</p>
<p>in terms of our speed of travel for space flight.</p>
<p>So you were the deputy administrator of NASA</p>
<p>and during the Obama administration,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a current Artemis program</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working on a crewed mission to the moon</p>
<p>and then perhaps to Mars.</p>
<p>What are you excited about there?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this program?</p>
<p>What are the biggest challenges do you think</p>
<p>of getting to the moon, of landing to the moon once again,</p>
<p>and then the big step to Mars?</p>
<p>Well, I love, you know, the moon program now, Artemis.</p>
<p>It is definitely, we&rsquo;ve been in low earth orbit.</p>
<p>I love low earth orbit too,</p>
<p>but I just always look at it as three phases.</p>
<p>So low earth orbit where we&rsquo;ve been 40 years,</p>
<p>so definitely time to get back to deep space,</p>
<p>time to get to the moon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to do on the moon.</p>
<p>I hope we don&rsquo;t get stuck on the moon for 50 years.</p>
<p>I really want to get to the moon, spend the next decade,</p>
<p>first with the lander, then humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot to explore,</p>
<p>but to me it&rsquo;s a big technology push.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only three days away.</p>
<p>So the moon is definitely the right place.</p>
<p>So we kind of buy down our technology.</p>
<p>We invest in specifically habitats, life support systems.</p>
<p>So we need suits.</p>
<p>We really need to understand really how to live off planet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been off planet and low earth orbit,</p>
<p>but still that&rsquo;s only 400 kilometers up, 250 miles, right?</p>
<p>So we get to the moon.</p>
<p>It really is a great proving ground for the technologies.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in deep space, radiation becomes a huge issue</p>
<p>and to keep our astronauts well and alive.</p>
<p>And I look at all of that investment for moon exploration</p>
<p>to the ultimate goal, the horizon goals we call it,</p>
<p>to get people to Mars.</p>
<p>But we just don&rsquo;t go to Mars tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>We really need a decade on the moon, I think,</p>
<p>investing in the technologies, learning,</p>
<p>making sure the astronauts are, their health,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re safe and well,</p>
<p>and also learning so much about in situ research utilization,</p>
<p>ISRU, in situ resource utilization is huge</p>
<p>when it comes to exploration for the moon and Mars.</p>
<p>So we need a test bed.</p>
<p>And to me, it really is a lunar test bed.</p>
<p>And then we use those same investments</p>
<p>to think about getting people to Mars in the 2030s.</p>
<p>So developing sort of a platform</p>
<p>of all the kind of research tools of all the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the resource utilization, can you speak to that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so ISRU for the moon, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go to the South Pole and it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>We have images of it.</p>
<p>Of course, we know there&rsquo;s permanently shaded areas</p>
<p>and like by Shackleton crater,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s areas that are permanently in the sun.</p>
<p>Well, it seems that there&rsquo;s a lot of water ice,</p>
<p>water that&rsquo;s entrapped in ice and the lunar craters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first place you go.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s water and when you wanna try to,</p>
<p>it could be fuel, life support systems.</p>
<p>So you kind of, again, you go where the water is.</p>
<p>And so when the moon is kind of for resources utilization,</p>
<p>but to learn how to,</p>
<p>can we make the fuels out of the resources</p>
<p>that are on the moon?</p>
<p>We have to think about 3D printing, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to bring all this mass with you.</p>
<p>You have to learn how to literally live off the land.</p>
<p>We need a pressure shell.</p>
<p>We need to have an atmosphere for people to live in.</p>
<p>So all of that is kind of buying down the technology,</p>
<p>doing the investigation, doing the science.</p>
<p>What are the basically called lunar volatiles?</p>
<p>What is that ice on the moon?</p>
<p>How much of it is there?</p>
<p>What are the resources look like?</p>
<p>To me, that helps us, that&rsquo;s just the next step</p>
<p>in getting humans to Mars.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s cheaper and more effective</p>
<p>to sort of develop some of these difficult challenges,</p>
<p>like solve some of these challenges,</p>
<p>practice, develop, test, and so on on the moon.</p>
<p>Absolutely. That is on Mars.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And people are gonna love to, you know,</p>
<p>you get to the moon, you get to,</p>
<p>you have a beautiful Earthrise.</p>
<p>I mean, you have the most magnificent view of Earth</p>
<p>being off planet.</p>
<p>So it just makes sense.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna have thousands, lots of people,</p>
<p>hopefully tens of thousands in low Earth orbit,</p>
<p>because low Earth orbit is a beautiful place to go</p>
<p>and look down on the Earth,</p>
<p>but people wanna return home.</p>
<p>I think the lunar explorers</p>
<p>will also wanna do round trips</p>
<p>and, you know, be on the moon, three day trip,</p>
<p>explore, do science, also because the lunar day</p>
<p>is 14 days and lunar nights, also 14 days.</p>
<p>So in that 28 day cycle, you know,</p>
<p>half of it is in light, half of it&rsquo;s in dark.</p>
<p>So people would probably wanna do, you know,</p>
<p>couple of week trips, month long trips,</p>
<p>not longer than that.</p>
<p>What do you mean by people?</p>
<p>People, explorers.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, astronauts are gonna be civilians</p>
<p>in the future too.</p>
<p>Not all astronauts are gonna be government astronauts.</p>
<p>Actually, when I was at NASA, we changed,</p>
<p>we actually got the law changed to recognize astronauts</p>
<p>that are not only government employees,</p>
<p>you know, NASA astronauts</p>
<p>or European Space Agency astronauts</p>
<p>or Russian Space Agency that astronauts,</p>
<p>because of the big push we put on the private sector,</p>
<p>that astronauts essentially are gonna be astronauts.</p>
<p>You get over 100 kilometers up</p>
<p>and think once you&rsquo;ve done orbital flight,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re an astronaut.</p>
<p>So a lot of private citizens are gonna become astronauts.</p>
<p>Do you think one day you might step foot on the moon?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be good to go to the moon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give that a shot.</p>
<p>Mars, I&rsquo;m gonna, it&rsquo;s my life&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>to get the next generation to Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s you or even younger than you,</p>
<p>you know, my students generation</p>
<p>will be the Martian explorers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just working to facilitate that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not gonna be me.</p>
<p>Hey, the moon&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot tough.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s still a really tough mission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extreme mission, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for exploration, but doable,</p>
<p>but again, before Apollo,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t think getting humans to the moon was even possible.</p>
<p>So we kind of made that possible, but we need to go back.</p>
<p>We absolutely need to go back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities</p>
<p>that we need to get there.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had that, you know,</p>
<p>since the Apollo days, since Saturn five.</p>
<p>So now we have three options on the board.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fantastic.</p>
<p>NASA has its space launch system.</p>
<p>SpaceX is gonna have its heavy capability</p>
<p>and Blue Origin is coming along too with heavy lifts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty fantastic from where I sit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Apollo program professor.</p>
<p>Today I have zero heavy lift launch capability.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait, just in a few years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have three different heavy lift launch capabilities.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty exciting.</p>
<p>You know, your heart is perhaps with NASA,</p>
<p>but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts of SpaceX</p>
<p>and the innovative efforts there</p>
<p>from the sort of private company aspect?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, remember that the investments in SpaceX</p>
<p>is government funding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s NASA funding, it&rsquo;s US Air Force funding,</p>
<p>just as it should be,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re betting on a company who is moving fast,</p>
<p>has some new technology development.</p>
<p>So I love it.</p>
<p>So when I was at NASA,</p>
<p>it really was under our public private partnerships.</p>
<p>So necessarily the government needs to fund</p>
<p>these startups.</p>
<p>Now, SpaceX is no longer a startup,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s been at it for 10 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had some accidents, learned a lot of lessons,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s great because it&rsquo;s the way you move faster.</p>
<p>And also some private industry folks,</p>
<p>some private businesses will take a lot more risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also really important for the government.</p>
<p>What do you think about that culture of risk?</p>
<p>I mean, sort of NASA and the government</p>
<p>are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a bit more of a culture of caution and safety</p>
<p>and sort of this kind of solid engineering.</p>
<p>And I think SpaceX as well has the same kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It has a little bit more of that startup feel</p>
<p>where they take the bigger risks.</p>
<p>Is that exciting for you to see,</p>
<p>seeing bigger risks in this kind of space?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And the best scenario is both of them working together</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really important lessons learned,</p>
<p>especially when you talk about human space flight,</p>
<p>safety, quality assurance.</p>
<p>These things are the utmost importance,</p>
<p>both aviation and space, you know,</p>
<p>when human lives are at stake.</p>
<p>On the other hand, government agencies,</p>
<p>NASA can be European Space Agency, you name it,</p>
<p>they become very bureaucratic, pretty risk averse,</p>
<p>move pretty slowly.</p>
<p>So I think the best is when you combine the partnerships</p>
<p>from both sides.</p>
<p>Industry necessarily has to push the government,</p>
<p>take some more risks.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re smart risk</p>
<p>or actually gave an award at NASA for failing smart.</p>
<p>Failing smart, I love that.</p>
<p>You know, so you can kind of break open the culture,</p>
<p>say, no, look at Apollo, that was a huge risk.</p>
<p>It was done well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always a culture of safety, quality assurance,</p>
<p>you know, engineering, you know, at its best.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, you want to get things done</p>
<p>and you have to also get them,</p>
<p>you have to bring the cost down.</p>
<p>You know, for when it comes to launch,</p>
<p>we really have to bring the cost down</p>
<p>and get the frequency up.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what the newcomers are doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really pushing that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about the most exciting time</p>
<p>that I can imagine for space flight.</p>
<p>Again, a little bit, it really is the democratization</p>
<p>of space flight, opening it up,</p>
<p>not just because of the launch capability,</p>
<p>but the science we can do on a CubeSat.</p>
<p>What you can do now for very,</p>
<p>those used to be, you know, student projects</p>
<p>that we would go through, conceive, design, implement,</p>
<p>and think about what a small satellite would be.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re the most, you know,</p>
<p>these are really advanced instruments,</p>
<p>science instruments that are flying on little teeny CubeSats</p>
<p>that pretty much anyone can afford.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a, there&rsquo;s every nation,</p>
<p>you know, every place in the world can fly a CubeSat.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a CubeSat?</p>
<p>Oh, CubeSat is a, this is called 1U.</p>
<p>CubeSats we measure in terms of units.</p>
<p>So, you know, just in terms of, I put my,</p>
<p>both my hands together, that&rsquo;s one unit, two units.</p>
<p>So little small satellites.</p>
<p>So CubeSats are for small satellites.</p>
<p>And we actually go by mass as well.</p>
<p>You know, a small satellite might be a hundred kilos,</p>
<p>200 kilos, all well under a thousand kilos.</p>
<p>CubeSats then are the next thing down from small sats.</p>
<p>You know, basically, you know,</p>
<p>kilos, tens of kilos, things like that.</p>
<p>But kind of the building blocks,</p>
<p>CubeSats are fantastic design,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of modular design.</p>
<p>So I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat and, you know,</p>
<p>but what if I have a little bit more money and payload,</p>
<p>I can fly three of them</p>
<p>and just basically put a lot more instruments on it.</p>
<p>But essentially think about something</p>
<p>the size of a shoe box, if you will.</p>
<p>You know, that would be a CubeSat.</p>
<p>And how do those help empower you in terms of doing size,</p>
<p>in terms of doing experiments?</p>
<p>Oh, right now there&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>back to private industry, Planet, the company,</p>
<p>is, you know, flying CubeSats</p>
<p>and literally looking down on Earth</p>
<p>and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will,</p>
<p>of Earth every day, every 24 hours,</p>
<p>covering the entire Earth.</p>
<p>So in terms of Earth observations,</p>
<p>in terms of climate change,</p>
<p>in terms of our changing Earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s revolutionizing because they&rsquo;re affordable.</p>
<p>We can put a whole bunch of them up.</p>
<p>Telecoms, we&rsquo;re all, you know, on our cell phones</p>
<p>and we have GPS, we have our telecoms,</p>
<p>but those used to be very expensive satellites</p>
<p>providing that service.</p>
<p>Now we can fly a whole bunch of modular CubeSats.</p>
<p>So it really is breakthrough in terms of modularity,</p>
<p>as well as cost reduction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one exciting set of developments.</p>
<p>Is there something else that you&rsquo;ve been excited about,</p>
<p>like reusable rockets, perhaps,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen in the last few years?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the reusability you had,</p>
<p>and the reusability is awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just the best.</p>
<p>Now we have to remember, the shuttle was a reusable vehicle.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which, and the shuttle is an amazing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s narrow space engineer.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, the shuttle is still,</p>
<p>this is the most gorgeous, elegant,</p>
<p>extraordinary design of a space vehicle.</p>
<p>It was reusable, it just wasn&rsquo;t affordable.</p>
<p>But the reusability of it was really critical</p>
<p>because we flew it up, it did come back.</p>
<p>So the notion of reusability, I think absolutely.</p>
<p>Now what we&rsquo;re doing with we, you know,</p>
<p>the Global We, but with SpaceX and Lord Jim,</p>
<p>setting the rockets up, recovering the first stages,</p>
<p>where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And just seeing the control,</p>
<p>you know, being in control and dynamic as a person,</p>
<p>just seeing that rocket come back and land.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It never gets old, it&rsquo;s exciting every single time</p>
<p>you look at it and say, that&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>To me, the landing is where I stand up,</p>
<p>start clapping, just the control.</p>
<p>Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms,</p>
<p>and hitting that landing, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gymnastics for rocket ships,</p>
<p>but to see these guys stick a landing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just wonderful.</p>
<p>So every time, like I say, every time I see,</p>
<p>you know, the reusability and the rockets coming back</p>
<p>and landing so precisely, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>So it is actually, that&rsquo;s a game changer.</p>
<p>We are in a new era of lower costs</p>
<p>and the higher frequency.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the world, not just NASA,</p>
<p>many nations are really upping their frequency of launches.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done a lot of exciting research,</p>
<p>design, engineering on spacesuits.</p>
<p>What does the spacesuit of the future look like?</p>
<p>Well, if I have anything to say about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a very, it&rsquo;ll be a very tight fitting suit.</p>
<p>We use mechanical counter pressure</p>
<p>to pressurize right directly on the skin.</p>
<p>Seems that it&rsquo;s technically feasible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still at the research and development stage.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a flight system, but technically it&rsquo;s feasible.</p>
<p>So we do a lot of work in the materials.</p>
<p>You know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the patterning we need?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our patents are in, the patterning,</p>
<p>kind of how we apply.</p>
<p>This is a third of an atmosphere.</p>
<p>Just to sort of take a little step back,</p>
<p>you have this incredible biosuit where it&rsquo;s tight fitting,</p>
<p>so it allows more mobility and so on.</p>
<p>So maybe even to take a bigger step back,</p>
<p>like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?</p>
<p>Sure, so start from the beginning.</p>
<p>A spacesuit is the world&rsquo;s smallest spacecraft.</p>
<p>So I really, that&rsquo;s the best definition I can give you.</p>
<p>Right now we fly gas pressurized suits,</p>
<p>but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.</p>
<p>So then you take all those systems</p>
<p>and you shrink them around a person,</p>
<p>provide them with oxygen to breathe,</p>
<p>scrub out their carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>you know, make sure they have pressure.</p>
<p>They need a pressure environment to live in.</p>
<p>So really the spacesuit is a shrunken,</p>
<p>you know, spacecraft in its entirety,</p>
<p>has all the same systems.</p>
<p>Communication as well, probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, communications, exactly.</p>
<p>So you really, thermal control,</p>
<p>little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection,</p>
<p>but thermal control, humidity, you know, oxygen debris.</p>
<p>So all those life support systems,</p>
<p>as well as the pressure protection.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an engineering marvel, you know,</p>
<p>the spacesuits that have flown</p>
<p>because they really are entire spacecraft,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the small spacecraft that we have around a person,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very massive,</p>
<p>but 140 kilos is the current suit,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not mobility suits.</p>
<p>So since we&rsquo;re going back to the moon and Mars,</p>
<p>we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve kind of flipped the design paradigm.</p>
<p>I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,</p>
<p>and if we can map that motion,</p>
<p>I want to give you full flexibility,</p>
<p>you know, move your arms and legs.</p>
<p>I really want you to be like a Olympic athlete,</p>
<p>an extreme explorer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to waste any of your energy,</p>
<p>so we take it from the human design.</p>
<p>So I take a look at humans, we measure them, we model them,</p>
<p>and then I say, okay, can I put a spacesuit on them</p>
<p>that goes from the skin out?</p>
<p>So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking</p>
<p>that spacecraft around the person,</p>
<p>say, here&rsquo;s how humans perform,</p>
<p>can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve come up with,</p>
<p>a mechanical counter pressure, some patterning,</p>
<p>and that way it could be order of magnitude less</p>
<p>in terms of the mass,</p>
<p>and it should provide maximum mobility for moon or Mars.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s mechanical counter pressure?</p>
<p>Like how the heck can you even begin</p>
<p>to create something that&rsquo;s tight fitting</p>
<p>and still doesn&rsquo;t protect you from the elements and so on</p>
<p>and the whole, the pressure thing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge, it&rsquo;s a big design challenge</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working on it for.</p>
<p>So you can either put someone in a balloon,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way to do it, that&rsquo;s conventional,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only thing we&rsquo;ve ever formed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>That means the balloon that you fill with gas?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a gas pressurized suit.</p>
<p>If you put someone in a balloon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a third of an atmosphere</p>
<p>to keep someone alive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the current system is.</p>
<p>So depending on what units you think,</p>
<p>in 30 kilopascals, 4.3 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>So much less than the pressure that&rsquo;s on Earth.</p>
<p>You can still keep a human alive with 0.3</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s alive and happy.</p>
<p>Alive and happy.</p>
<p>And you mix the gases.</p>
<p>June, we&rsquo;re having this chat</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re at one sea level in Boston, one atmosphere.</p>
<p>But a suit. Oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
<p>Oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
<p>And you put a suit, if we put someone to a third</p>
<p>of an atmosphere, so for mechanical counter pressure now,</p>
<p>so one way is to do it with a balloon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we currently have.</p>
<p>Or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.</p>
<p>I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.</p>
<p>Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere.</p>
<p>So if I put that pressure, a third of an atmosphere on you,</p>
<p>I just have to do it consistently,</p>
<p>across all of your body and your limbs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be a gas pressurized helmet.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make sense to shrink wrap the head.</p>
<p>See the blue mangrove, that&rsquo;s a great, it&rsquo;s a great act.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need to, there&rsquo;s no benefits</p>
<p>of like shrink wrapping the head.</p>
<p>You put, you know, a gas pressurized helmet</p>
<p>because the helmet then, the future of suits,</p>
<p>you asked me about, the helmet just becomes</p>
<p>your information portal.</p>
<p>So it will have augmented reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll have all the information you need.</p>
<p>Should have, you know, the maps that I need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the moon.</p>
<p>Okay, well, hey, smart helmet.</p>
<p>Then show me the map, show me the topography.</p>
<p>Hopefully it has the lab embedded too.</p>
<p>If it has really great cameras,</p>
<p>maybe I can see with that regolith.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just lunar dust and dirt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that made out of?</p>
<p>We talked about the water.</p>
<p>So the helmet then really becomes this information portal</p>
<p>is how I see kind of the IT architecture of the helmet</p>
<p>is really allowing me to, you know,</p>
<p>use all of my modalities of an explorer that I&rsquo;d like to.</p>
<p>So cameras, voiceover, images, if it were really good,</p>
<p>it would kind of be, would have lab capabilities as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,</p>
<p>comes from the mechanical pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Now, what aspect, when I look at Biosuit,</p>
<p>just the suits you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.</p>
<p>Is that a small part of it too?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, because the teams that we work with,</p>
<p>of course, I&rsquo;m an engineer, there&rsquo;s engineering students,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s design students, there&rsquo;s architects.</p>
<p>So it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,</p>
<p>all those things we pay attention to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just an engineering solution.</p>
<p>It really is a much more holistic, it&rsquo;s a suit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a suit, you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dressed in a suit now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a warm fitting.</p>
<p>So we really have to pay attention to all those things.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the design team that we work with.</p>
<p>And my partner, Geetraati, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re partners in this in terms of,</p>
<p>he comes from an architecture, industrial design background.</p>
<p>So bringing those skills to bear as well.</p>
<p>We team up with industry folks who are in, you know,</p>
<p>athletic performance and designers.</p>
<p>So it really is a team</p>
<p>that brings all those skills together.</p>
<p>So what role does this space suit play</p>
<p>in our longterm staying in Mars,</p>
<p>sort of exploring the,</p>
<p>doing all the work that astronauts do,</p>
<p>but also perhaps civilians one day,</p>
<p>almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars?</p>
<p>What role does a space suit play there?</p>
<p>So you always need life support system, pressurized habitat.</p>
<p>And I like to say, we&rsquo;re not going to Mars to sit around.</p>
<p>So you need a suit.</p>
<p>You know, even if you land and have the lander,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going there to stay inside.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for darn sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going there to search for the evidence of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to Mars.</p>
<p>So you need a lot of mobility.</p>
<p>So for me, the suit is the best way</p>
<p>to give the human mobility.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always still going to need rovers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need robots.</p>
<p>So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.</p>
<p>Some people are going to,</p>
<p>some of the suite of explorers are humans,</p>
<p>but many are going to be robots, smart systems,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together</p>
<p>make the best exploration team.</p>
<p>So let me ask, I love artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve also saw that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the movie</p>
<p>Space Odyssey, 2001 Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>Let me ask the question about HAL 9000.</p>
<p>That makes a few decisions there</p>
<p>that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.</p>
<p>Do you think, from a high philosophical question,</p>
<p>do you think HAL did the right thing</p>
<p>of prioritizing the mission?</p>
<p>I think our artificial intelligence</p>
<p>will be smarter in the future.</p>
<p>For a Mars mission, it&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>that the reality is for a Mars mission,</p>
<p>we need fully autonomous systems.</p>
<p>We will get humans, but they have to be fully autonomous.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really important,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important concept</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not going to be a mission control on Earth.</p>
<p>20 minute time lag,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way you&rsquo;re going to control it.</p>
<p>So fully autonomous,</p>
<p>so people have to be fully autonomous as well,</p>
<p>but all of our systems as well.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the big design challenge.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we test them out on the moon as well.</p>
<p>When we have a, okay, a few second,</p>
<p>three second time lag, you can test them out.</p>
<p>We have to really get autonomous exploration down.</p>
<p>You asked me earlier about Magellan.</p>
<p>Magellan and his crew, they left, right?</p>
<p>They were autonomous.</p>
<p>You know, they were autonomous.</p>
<p>They left and they were on their own</p>
<p>to figure out that mission.</p>
<p>Then when they hit land, they have resources,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in situ resource utilization</p>
<p>and everything else they brought with them.</p>
<p>So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.</p>
<p>Again, back to the moon, it&rsquo;s more the testing ground,</p>
<p>the proving ground with technologies.</p>
<p>But when we get to Mars, it&rsquo;s so far away</p>
<p>that we need fully autonomous systems.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s where, again, AI and autonomy come in,</p>
<p>a really robust autonomy,</p>
<p>things that we don&rsquo;t have today yet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re on the drawing boards,</p>
<p>but we really need to test them out</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re up against.</p>
<p>So fully autonomous meaning like self sufficient.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a role for the human in that picture.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a time when AI systems,</p>
<p>beyond doing fully autonomous flight control</p>
<p>will also help or even take mission decisions</p>
<p>like Hal did?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re gonna be designed by humans.</p>
<p>I think as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.</p>
<p>I mean, we might be on Earth,</p>
<p>we might be in orbit on Mars,</p>
<p>maybe the systems of landers down on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>we are right now just on Earth based systems,</p>
<p>AI systems that are incredibly capable</p>
<p>and training them with all the data that we have now,</p>
<p>petabytes of data from Earth.</p>
<p>What I care about for the autonomy and AI right now,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re applying it in research</p>
<p>is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s not for Mars to me today.</p>
<p>Right now AI is to eyes on Earth,</p>
<p>all of our space data, compiling that using supercomputers</p>
<p>because we have so much information and knowledge</p>
<p>and we need to get that into people&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s the educational issue with climate</p>
<p>and our changing climate.</p>
<p>Then we need to change human behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggie.</p>
<p>So this next decade, it&rsquo;s urgent</p>
<p>we take care of our own spaceship, which is spaceship Earth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s to me where my focus has been for AI systems,</p>
<p>using whatever&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>kind of imagining also what the future situation is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the satellite imagery of Earth of the future.</p>
<p>If you can hold that in your hands,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be really powerful.</p>
<p>Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth</p>
<p>and for us to live in balance with Earth?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>And kind of start with the ocean systems.</p>
<p>So oceans to land to air and kind of using</p>
<p>all the space data.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge role for artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,</p>
<p>using the data.</p>
<p>It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.</p>
<p>Do you think in a weird, dark question,</p>
<p>do you think human species can survive</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t become interplanetary</p>
<p>in the next century or a couple of centuries?</p>
<p>Absolutely we can survive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Mars is option B actually.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s all about saving spaceship Earth</p>
<p>and humanity.</p>
<p>I simply put, Earth doesn&rsquo;t need us,</p>
<p>but we really need Earth.</p>
<p>All of humanity needs to live in balance with Earth</p>
<p>because Earth has been here a long time</p>
<p>before we ever showed up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be here a long time after.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of how do we wanna live</p>
<p>with all living beings, much more in balance</p>
<p>because we need to take care of the Earth</p>
<p>and right now we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the urgency.</p>
<p>And I think it is the next decade</p>
<p>to try to live much more sustainably,</p>
<p>live more in balance with Earth.</p>
<p>I think the human species has a great long optimistic future,</p>
<p>but we have to act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s urgent.</p>
<p>We have to change behavior.</p>
<p>We have to realize that we&rsquo;re all in this together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one blue bubble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for humanity.</p>
<p>So when I think people realize that we&rsquo;re all astronauts,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the great news is everyone&rsquo;s gonna be an astronaut.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all astronauts of spaceship Earth.</p>
<p>And again, this is our mission.</p>
<p>This is our mission to take care of the planet.</p>
<p>And yet as we explore out from our spaceship Earth here</p>
<p>out into the space,</p>
<p>what do you think the next 50, 100, 200 years</p>
<p>look like for space exploration?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>So I think that we&rsquo;ll have lots of people,</p>
<p>thousands of people, tens of thousands of people,</p>
<p>who knows, maybe millions in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a place that we&rsquo;re gonna have people</p>
<p>and actually some industry, manufacturing, things like that.</p>
<p>That dream I hope we realize, getting people to the moon.</p>
<p>So I can envision a lot of people on the moon.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a great place to go.</p>
<p>Living or visiting?</p>
<p>Probably visiting and living.</p>
<p>If you want to, most people are gonna wanna come back</p>
<p>to Earth, I think.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;ll be some people and it&rsquo;s not such a long,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good view, it&rsquo;s a beautiful view.</p>
<p>So I think that we will have many people</p>
<p>on the moon as well.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be some people, you told me, wow,</p>
<p>hundreds of years out.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have people, we&rsquo;ll be interplanetary for sure</p>
<p>as a species.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll be on the moon.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll be on Mars.</p>
<p>Venus, no, it&rsquo;s already a runaway greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>So not a great place for science.</p>
<p>Jupiter, all within the solar system,</p>
<p>great place for all of our scientific probes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see so much in terms of human physical presence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be exploring them.</p>
<p>So we live in our minds there because we&rsquo;re exploring them</p>
<p>and going on those journeys.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really our choice in terms of our decisions</p>
<p>of how in balance we&rsquo;re gonna be living here on the Earth.</p>
<p>When do you think the first woman, first person will step on Mars?</p>
<p>Ah, step on Mars?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna do everything I can</p>
<p>to make sure it happens in the 2030s.</p>
<p>2030s.</p>
<p>Say mid, 20, mid 20, 2025, 2035, we&rsquo;ll be on the moon.</p>
<p>And hopefully with more people than us.</p>
<p>But first with a few astronauts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be global, international folks.</p>
<p>But we really need those 10 years, I think, on the moon.</p>
<p>And then so by later in the decade, in the 2030s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have all the technology and know how,</p>
<p>and we need to get that human mission to Mars done.</p>
<p>We live in exciting times.</p>
