all the problems with chronic inflammation and there&amp;rsquo;s quite a few let&amp;rsquo;s start with the artery okay the inside of the artery has this little lining of cells called the endothelial cells and when you expose that layer of the inside of your artery to things that cause inflammation or oxidation or free radical damage like sugar having a high sugar level or omega-6 oils especially or other things like tobacco smoke or alcohol whatever you create irritation you create chronic inflammation and from that condition you can get a clot because the proteins start to get become sticky you can then get a stroke or heart attack and this also makes the artery thicker and more rigid leading to high blood pressure also the inflammation on the inside of the artery causes a healing effect where the body comes in with a band-aid with cholesterol with calcium and scar tissue okay so then you get an atherosclerotic plaque that can build up in the artery and also cause a heart attack one really really good thing to prevent and reverse this is get on the healthy ketogenic diet and do intermittent fasting okay and also take something called tocotrienols which is a type of vitamin e that&amp;rsquo;s very powerful to help heal and protect the inside of the artery from becoming damaged and inflamed also omega-3 fatty acids like cod liver oil or fish oils are very very important now let&amp;rsquo;s go to asthma which is a condition where your lungs are involved there&amp;rsquo;s inflammation vitamin d3 is the best antidote for that this is why kids with asthma if they&amp;rsquo;re on the sun find great relief with breathing if they have asthma now arthritis there&amp;rsquo;s two major types i want to talk about number one is the degenerative joint disease where you just have wear and tear on the in the joints and the inflammation that can develop from that is just from irritation in the joints because you lost collagen cartilage connective tissue one of the best remedies for that that i found is stinging nettle root and it seems to work really good for that condition shifting gears an autoimmune condition there&amp;rsquo;s quite a few where your body is attacking itself creating inflammation this usually starts in the gut there&amp;rsquo;s also usually stress involved i found personally there&amp;rsquo;s a link between a major loss which shocks the adrenal system and the immune system and allows this condition to progress one of the best remedies for this would be getting on a low carb diet the healthy keto diet and regular intermittent fasting and a lot of vitamin d for this condition many times you need to do higher amounts of vitamin d starting with like 30 or 40,000 IUs of vitamin d on a regular basis and this seems to greatly improve this condition because vitamin d3 is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories all right next point is stress that activates cortisol to the point where you either have a cortisol resistant situation where even though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of cortisol going through your body which normally is anti-inflammatory it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because the receptors are downgraded so it&amp;rsquo;s ineffective or it&amp;rsquo;s a situation where you have a low amount of cortisol because the adrenals are burnt out as in addison&amp;rsquo;s disease in this situation one of the best remedies is to support the adrenal directly as well as take vitamin d3 vitamin d3 is not really even a vitamin it is a hormone and it acts like cortisol but without the side effects so cortisol really is an anti-inflammatory but if it&amp;rsquo;s not working you get inflammation just think about any condition any medical condition involving inflammation whether it&amp;rsquo;s just from having an autoimmune disease or some skin problem or pain in your back what do they use prednisone what&amp;rsquo;s prednisone it&amp;rsquo;s a synthetic version of cortisol all right so shifting gears now we have diabetes which is a state of high blood sugars which creates a lot of inflammation in the body and this is because high levels of sugar in the blood act like steel wool or sandpaper to the inside of the arteries the inside of the kidneys on the nerves in the eyes and it creates inflammation what is the best antidote well reducing the carbohydrates and reducing the sugar in the diet and doing intermittent fasting all right next point is just junk food in general okay refined foods what&amp;rsquo;s lacking refined foods is the antioxidants okay and the nutrients that act like antioxidants that then allow more oxidation and free radicals to create more damage in your dna and the tissues and so you just need to avoid refined foods and eat foods high in nutrients and naturally high in antioxidants all right next point would be infections let&amp;rsquo;s say you had some bacterial infection that you have a tooth infection that can create inflammation in different places in your body even in your heart which is actually quite fascinating and in your joints there are people that have arthritis that&amp;rsquo;s all stemming from a tooth infection okay i&amp;rsquo;ve done a video on this and you can check it out people that have chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia usually have some type of infection in their body it could be either virus like an epstein-barr virus or it could be lyme or it can be some other virus that is going in remission in outer emission triggered by stress or age or whatever the best remedy for this is to reduce your stress as much as possible and take things that are anti-microbial like garlic oregano thyme and herbs that actually can put these viruses back into remission i&amp;rsquo;ve done videos on that i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about cancer which is an interesting topic in relationship to inflammation cancer tends to follow inflammation it tends to go into areas of your body that are inflamed this is why cancer tends to show up in areas of old injury which is very interesting i&amp;rsquo;ve done a video on this and so there&amp;rsquo;s definitely associations between inflammation and cancer increased risk of getting cancer with high levels of inflammation probably because it&amp;rsquo;s connected with higher levels of maybe viruses or carcinogens or damage in the body does inflammation directly cause cancer we&amp;rsquo;re not sure it could but we don&amp;rsquo;t know yet but we do know there are carcinogens and there&amp;rsquo;s also anti-cancer foods there are certain things in foods especially phytonutrients for example that have powerful anti-cancer effects that can help you prevent cancer and then if you have cancer it can actually help you kill cancer too i&amp;rsquo;ve done videos on this the other very important thing to do if you have cancer is fasting fasting probably has the most potent effect over cancer of anything because when you fast you turn on all sorts of anti-cancer genes and you can even put a cancer gene that&amp;rsquo;s active into an inactive state when you do fasting and fasting directly has a potent effect over chronic inflammation if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel and you want more information about that check out the video down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today

chronic inflammation and there&rsquo;s quite a few  </p><p>let&rsquo;s start with the artery okay the inside 
of the artery has this little lining of  </p><p>cells called the endothelial cells and when you 
expose that layer of the inside of your artery  </p><p>to things that cause inflammation or oxidation 
or free radical damage like sugar having a high  </p><p>sugar level or omega-6 oils especially or other 
things like tobacco smoke or alcohol whatever  </p><p>you create irritation you create chronic 
inflammation and from that condition you  </p><p>can get a clot because the proteins start to get 
become sticky you can then get a stroke or heart  </p><p>attack and this also makes the artery thicker 
and more rigid leading to high blood pressure  </p><p>also the inflammation on the inside of the 
artery causes a healing effect where the  </p><p>body comes in with a band-aid with cholesterol 
with calcium and scar tissue okay so then you  </p><p>get an atherosclerotic plaque that can build 
up in the artery and also cause a heart attack  </p><p>one really really good thing to prevent and 
reverse this is get on the healthy ketogenic diet  </p><p>and do intermittent fasting okay and also take 
something called tocotrienols which is a type of  </p><p>vitamin e that&rsquo;s very powerful to help heal and 
protect the inside of the artery from becoming  </p><p>damaged and inflamed also omega-3 fatty acids like 
cod liver oil or fish oils are very very important  </p><p>now let&rsquo;s go to asthma which is a condition where 
your lungs are involved there&rsquo;s inflammation  </p><p>vitamin d3 is the best antidote for that this 
is why kids with asthma if they&rsquo;re on the sun  </p><p>find great relief with breathing if they have 
asthma now arthritis there&rsquo;s two major types i  </p><p>want to talk about number one is the degenerative 
joint disease where you just have wear and tear on  </p><p>the in the joints and the inflammation that can 
develop from that is just from irritation in the  </p><p>joints because you lost collagen cartilage 
connective tissue one of the best remedies  </p><p>for that that i found is stinging nettle root and 
it seems to work really good for that condition  </p><p>shifting gears an autoimmune condition there&rsquo;s 
quite a few where your body is attacking itself  </p><p>creating inflammation this usually starts in 
the gut there&rsquo;s also usually stress involved  </p><p>i found personally there&rsquo;s a link between a 
major loss which shocks the adrenal system  </p><p>and the immune system and allows this condition to 
progress one of the best remedies for this would  </p><p>be getting on a low carb diet the healthy keto 
diet and regular intermittent fasting and a lot  </p><p>of vitamin d for this condition many times 
you need to do higher amounts of vitamin d  </p><p>starting with like 30 or 40,000 IUs of 
vitamin d on a regular basis and this seems to  </p><p>greatly improve this condition because vitamin d3 
is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories  </p><p>all right next point is stress that activates 
cortisol to the point where you either have a  </p><p>cortisol resistant situation where even though 
there&rsquo;s a lot of cortisol going through your  </p><p>body which normally is anti-inflammatory it 
doesn&rsquo;t work because the receptors are downgraded  </p><p>so it&rsquo;s ineffective or it&rsquo;s a situation where 
you have a low amount of cortisol because the  </p><p>adrenals are burnt out as in addison&rsquo;s disease 
in this situation one of the best remedies is  </p><p>to support the adrenal directly as well as take 
vitamin d3 vitamin d3 is not really even a vitamin  </p><p>it is a hormone and it acts like cortisol but 
without the side effects so cortisol really is  </p><p>an anti-inflammatory but if it&rsquo;s not working you 
get inflammation just think about any condition  </p><p>any medical condition involving inflammation 
whether it&rsquo;s just from having an autoimmune  </p><p>disease or some skin problem or pain in your back 
what do they use prednisone what&rsquo;s prednisone  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a synthetic version of cortisol all right 
so shifting gears now we have diabetes which is  </p><p>a state of high blood sugars which creates a lot 
of inflammation in the body and this is because  </p><p>high levels of sugar in the blood act like steel 
wool or sandpaper to the inside of the arteries  </p><p>the inside of the kidneys on the nerves 
in the eyes and it creates inflammation  </p><p>what is the best antidote well reducing the 
carbohydrates and reducing the sugar in the diet  </p><p>and doing intermittent fasting 
all right next point is just  </p><p>junk food in general okay refined foods what&rsquo;s 
lacking refined foods is the antioxidants  </p><p>okay and the nutrients that act like antioxidants 
that then allow more oxidation and free radicals  </p><p>to create more damage in your dna and the tissues 
and so you just need to avoid refined foods and  </p><p>eat foods high in nutrients and naturally high 
in antioxidants all right next point would be  </p><p>infections let&rsquo;s say you had some bacterial 
infection that you have a tooth infection  </p><p>that can create inflammation in different 
places in your body even in your heart  </p><p>which is actually quite fascinating and in your 
joints there are people that have arthritis  </p><p>that&rsquo;s all stemming from a tooth infection okay 
i&rsquo;ve done a video on this and you can check it  </p><p>out people that have chronic fatigue syndrome 
or fibromyalgia usually have some type of  </p><p>infection in their body it could be either virus 
like an epstein-barr virus or it could be lyme  </p><p>or it can be some other virus that is going in 
remission in outer emission triggered by stress  </p><p>or age or whatever the best remedy for this is to 
reduce your stress as much as possible and take  </p><p>things that are anti-microbial like garlic 
oregano thyme and herbs that actually can  </p><p>put these viruses back into remission i&rsquo;ve 
done videos on that i&rsquo;ll put a link down  </p><p>below now let&rsquo;s talk about cancer which is an 
interesting topic in relationship to inflammation  </p><p>cancer tends to follow inflammation it tends to 
go into areas of your body that are inflamed this  </p><p>is why cancer tends to show up in areas of old 
injury which is very interesting i&rsquo;ve done a video  </p><p>on this and so there&rsquo;s definitely associations 
between inflammation and cancer increased risk  </p><p>of getting cancer with high levels of inflammation 
probably because it&rsquo;s connected with higher levels  </p><p>of maybe viruses or carcinogens or damage in 
the body does inflammation directly cause cancer  </p><p>we&rsquo;re not sure it could but we don&rsquo;t know 
yet but we do know there are carcinogens  </p><p>and there&rsquo;s also anti-cancer foods there are 
certain things in foods especially phytonutrients  </p><p>for example that have powerful anti-cancer 
effects that can help you prevent cancer  </p><p>and then if you have cancer it can 
actually help you kill cancer too  </p><p>i&rsquo;ve done videos on this the other very important 
thing to do if you have cancer is fasting  </p><p>fasting probably has the most potent effect 
over cancer of anything because when you fast  </p><p>you turn on all sorts of anti-cancer genes and 
you can even put a cancer gene that&rsquo;s active  </p><p>into an inactive state when you do fasting 
and fasting directly has a potent effect  </p><p>over chronic inflammation if you&rsquo;re new to my 
channel and you want more information about that  </p><p>check out the video down below hey before 
you go real quick i have a course entitled  </p><p>how to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a 
free course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what 
about strengthening your immune system  </p><p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show 
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you  </p><p>can tolerate and resist your environment much 
better by strengthening your own immune system  </p><p>i put a link down in the description right down
