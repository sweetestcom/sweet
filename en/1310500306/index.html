    <p>Let me ask you to this question,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s bell curve or any research</p>
<p>on race differences,</p>
<p>can that be used to increase the amount of racism</p>
<p>in the world, can that be used to increase</p>
<p>the amount of hate in the world?</p>
<p>My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs</p>
<p>of hate and racism that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with scientific knowledge of the data</p>
<p>that speak against that,</p>
<p>that no, I don&rsquo;t want to give racist groups</p>
<p>a veto power over what scientists study.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Richard Heyer</p>
<p>on the science of human intelligence.</p>
<p>This is a highly controversial topic,</p>
<p>but a critically important one</p>
<p>for understanding the human mind.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in not shying away</p>
<p>from difficult topics like this,</p>
<p>and instead, let us try to navigate it</p>
<p>with empathy, rigor, and grace.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching this on video now,</p>
<p>I should mention that I&rsquo;m recording this introduction</p>
<p>in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m safe and happy and life is beautiful.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description, and now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Richard Heyer.</p>
<p>What are the measures of human intelligence,</p>
<p>and how do we measure it?</p>
<p>Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.</p>
<p>In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence</p>
<p>is just being smart, how well you reason,</p>
<p>how well you figure things out,</p>
<p>what you do when you don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions</p>
<p>of how people use the word intelligence.</p>
<p>If you wanna do research on intelligence,</p>
<p>measuring something that you can study scientifically</p>
<p>is a little trickier, and what almost all researchers</p>
<p>who study intelligence use is the concept</p>
<p>called the G factor, general intelligence,</p>
<p>and that is what is common, that is a mental ability</p>
<p>that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the origin of the term G factor,</p>
<p>by the way, such a funny word</p>
<p>for such a fundamental human thing?</p>
<p>The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman,</p>
<p>and he noticed, this is like, boy,</p>
<p>more than 100 years ago, he noticed that</p>
<p>when you tested people with different tests,</p>
<p>all the tests were correlated positively,</p>
<p>and so he was looking at student exams and things,</p>
<p>and he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially,</p>
<p>and when he used it to look at student performance</p>
<p>on various topics, he found all the scores</p>
<p>were correlated with each other,</p>
<p>and they were all positive correlations,</p>
<p>so he inferred from this that there must be</p>
<p>some common factor that was irrespective</p>
<p>of the content of the test.</p>
<p>And positive correlation means if you do well</p>
<p>on the first test, you&rsquo;re likely to do well</p>
<p>on the second test, and presumably,</p>
<p>that holds for tests across even disciplines,</p>
<p>so not within subject, but across subjects,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s where the general comes in,</p>
<p>something about general intelligence.</p>
<p>So when you were talking about measuring intelligence</p>
<p>and trying to figure out something difficult</p>
<p>about this world and how to solve the puzzles</p>
<p>of this world, that means, generally speaking,</p>
<p>not some specific test, but across all tests.</p>
<p>Absolutely right, and people get hung up on this</p>
<p>because they say, well, what about the ability</p>
<p>to do X, isn&rsquo;t that independent?</p>
<p>And they said, I know somebody who&rsquo;s very good at this</p>
<p>but not so good at this, this other thing.</p>
<p>And so there are a lot of examples like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a general tendency, so exceptions</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t disprove, your everyday experience</p>
<p>is not the same as what the data actually show.</p>
<p>And your everyday experience, when you say,</p>
<p>oh, I know someone who&rsquo;s good at X, but not so good at Y,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t contradict the statement of about,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not so good, but he&rsquo;s not the opposite.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not a negative correlation.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re not, our anecdotal data,</p>
<p>I know a guy who&rsquo;s really good at solving</p>
<p>some kind of visual thing, that&rsquo;s not sufficient</p>
<p>for us to understand actually the depths</p>
<p>of that person&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>So how, this idea of G factor,</p>
<p>how much evidence is there, how strong,</p>
<p>you know, given across the decades that this idea</p>
<p>has been around, how much has it been held up</p>
<p>that there is a universal sort of horsepower</p>
<p>of intelligence that&rsquo;s underneath all of it,</p>
<p>all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing</p>
<p>in the depths of the human mind that&rsquo;s a universal,</p>
<p>stable measure of a person&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>You used a couple of words in there, stable and.</p>
<p>We have to be precise with words?</p>
<p>I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.</p>
<p>We can, there&rsquo;s a lot about research in general,</p>
<p>not just intelligence research that is poetic.</p>
<p>Science has a punetic aspect to it.</p>
<p>Good scientists are very intuitive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just, hey, these are the numbers.</p>
<p>You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.</p>
<p>When it comes to intelligence research,</p>
<p>you asked how well has this general concept held up?</p>
<p>And I think I can say without fear</p>
<p>of being empirically contradicted,</p>
<p>that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.</p>
<p>Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal,</p>
<p>psychology, we all know there&rsquo;s a replication crisis</p>
<p>in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn&rsquo;t replicate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all true.</p>
<p>There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying</p>
<p>the existence of this general factor.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some things about it.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s universal</p>
<p>that you find it in all cultures.</p>
<p>The way you find it, step back one step,</p>
<p>the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.</p>
<p>What battery?</p>
<p>You choose.</p>
<p>Take a battery of any mental tests you want,</p>
<p>give it to a large number of diverse people,</p>
<p>and you will be able to extract statistically</p>
<p>the commonality among all those tests.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done by a technique called factor analysis.</p>
<p>People think that this may be a statistical artifact</p>
<p>of some kind, it is not a statistical artifact.</p>
<p>What is factor analysis?</p>
<p>Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data</p>
<p>and look at the correlation among the different test scores</p>
<p>and then find empirically the clusters of scores</p>
<p>that go together.</p>
<p>And there are different factors.</p>
<p>So if you have a bunch of mental tests,</p>
<p>there may be a verbal factor,</p>
<p>there may be a numerical factor,</p>
<p>there may be a visual spatial factor,</p>
<p>but those factors have variance in common with each other.</p>
<p>And that is the common,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s common among all the tests</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what gets labeled the G factor.</p>
<p>So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests</p>
<p>and you extract a G factor from it,</p>
<p>that factor usually accounts for around half of the variance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the single biggest factor, but it&rsquo;s not the only factor,</p>
<p>but it is the most reliable, it is the most stable,</p>
<p>and it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to change the G factor with training</p>
<p>or drugs or anything else.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how to increase the G factor.</p>
<p>Okay, you said a lot of really interesting things there.</p>
<p>So first, I mean, just to get people used to it</p>
<p>in case they&rsquo;re not familiar with this idea,</p>
<p>G factor is what we mean.</p>
<p>So often there&rsquo;s this term used IQ,</p>
<p>which is the way IQ is used,</p>
<p>they really mean G factor in regular conversation.</p>
<p>Because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence</p>
<p>and what we mean by intelligence,</p>
<p>we mean general intelligence and general intelligence</p>
<p>in the human mind from a psychology,</p>
<p>from a serious rigorous scientific perspective</p>
<p>actually means G factor.</p>
<p>So G factor equals intelligence,</p>
<p>just in this conversation to define terms.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s this stable thing called G factor.</p>
<p>You said, now factor, you said factor many times,</p>
<p>means a measure that potentially could be reduced</p>
<p>to a single number across the different factors</p>
<p>you mentioned.</p>
<p>And what you said, it accounts for half, halfish.</p>
<p>Accounts for halfish of what?</p>
<p>Of variance across the different set of tests.</p>
<p>Set of tests, so if you do for some reason</p>
<p>well on some set of tests, what does that mean?</p>
<p>So that means there&rsquo;s some unique capabilities</p>
<p>outside of the G factor that might account for that.</p>
<p>And what are those?</p>
<p>What else is there besides the raw horsepower,</p>
<p>the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?</p>
<p>There are test taking skills.</p>
<p>There are specific abilities.</p>
<p>Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things,</p>
<p>mathematical concepts, even simple arithmetic.</p>
<p>Some people are much better than others.</p>
<p>You might know people who can memorize,</p>
<p>and short term memory is another component of this.</p>
<p>Short term memory is one of the cognitive processes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most highly correlated with the G factor.</p>
<p>So all those things like memory,</p>
<p>test taking skills account for variability</p>
<p>across the test performances.</p>
<p>But so you can run, but you can&rsquo;t hide</p>
<p>from the thing that God gave you.</p>
<p>The genetics, so that G factor,</p>
<p>science says that G factor&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Each one of us have.</p>
<p>Each one of us has a G factor.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Some have more than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting uncomfortable already.</p>
<p>Well, IQ is a score, and IQ, an IQ score</p>
<p>is a very good estimate of the G factor.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t measure G directly, there&rsquo;s no direct measure.</p>
<p>You estimate it from these statistical techniques.</p>
<p>But an IQ score is a good estimate, why?</p>
<p>Because a standard IQ test is a battery</p>
<p>of different mental abilities.</p>
<p>You combined it into one score,</p>
<p>and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,</p>
<p>even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.</p>
<p>Because again, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>to all these mental abilities.</p>
<p>So a good IQ test, and I&rsquo;ll ask you about that,</p>
<p>but a good IQ test tries to compress down that battery</p>
<p>of tests, like tries to get a nice battery,</p>
<p>the nice selection of variable tests into one test.</p>
<p>And so in that way, it sneaks up to this G factor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another interesting thing about G factor.</p>
<p>Now you give, first of all, you have a great book</p>
<p>on the neuroscience of intelligence.</p>
<p>You have a great course, which is when I first learned,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a great teacher, let me just say.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Your course at the teaching company,</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m saying that correctly.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Brain.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Brain is when I first heard</p>
<p>about this G factor, this mysterious thing</p>
<p>that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine</p>
<p>a light on, we&rsquo;re trying to sneak up on.</p>
<p>So the fact that there&rsquo;s this measure,</p>
<p>a stable measure of intelligence, we can&rsquo;t measure directly.</p>
<p>But we can come up with a battery test</p>
<p>or one test that includes a battery</p>
<p>of variable type of questions that can reliably</p>
<p>or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating idea.</p>
<p>So for me as an AI person, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating there&rsquo;s something stable like that</p>
<p>about the human mind, especially if it&rsquo;s grounded in genetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both fascinating that as a researcher</p>
<p>of the human mind and all the human psychological,</p>
<p>sociological, ethical questions that start arising,</p>
<p>it makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But truth can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I get that a lot about being uncomfortable</p>
<p>talking about this.</p>
<p>Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which battery of tests you use.</p>
<p>So there are countless tests.</p>
<p>You can take any 12 of them at random,</p>
<p>extract a G factor and another 12 at random</p>
<p>and extract a G factor and those G factors</p>
<p>will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, so it is a ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t depend on the content of the test</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>It is general among all those tests of mental ability.</p>
<p>And tests of mental, mental abilities include things like,</p>
<p>geez, playing poker.</p>
<p>Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.</p>
<p>Your skill at anything that requires reasoning</p>
<p>and thinking, anything, spelling, arithmetic,</p>
<p>more complex things, this concept is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures,</p>
<p>you get the same thing.</p>
<p>So this says something interesting about the human mind</p>
<p>that as a computer is designed to be general.</p>
<p>So that means you can, so it&rsquo;s not easily made specialized.</p>
<p>Meaning if you&rsquo;re going to be good at one thing,</p>
<p>Miyamoto Musashi has this quote, he&rsquo;s an ancient warrior,</p>
<p>famous for the Book of Five Rings in the martial arts world.</p>
<p>And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly,</p>
<p>you will see it in everything.</p>
<p>Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize</p>
<p>to everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting quote.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting thing about the human mind.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the G factor reveals.</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s the difference,</p>
<p>if you can elaborate a little bit further</p>
<p>between IQ and G factor?</p>
<p>Just because it&rsquo;s a source of confusion for people.</p>
<p>And IQ is a score.</p>
<p>People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.</p>
<p>But IQ has a more technical meaning</p>
<p>for people who work in the field.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an IQ score, a score on a test</p>
<p>that estimates the G factor.</p>
<p>And the G factor is what&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>among all these tests of mental ability.</p>
<p>So if you think about, it&rsquo;s not a Venn diagram,</p>
<p>but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it,</p>
<p>but the G factor would be really at the core,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s common to everything.</p>
<p>And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order</p>
<p>of people on the score.</p>
<p>And this is what makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This is where there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy</p>
<p>about whether IQ tests are biased</p>
<p>toward any one group or another.</p>
<p>And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,</p>
<p>but they also have a technical aspect of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not so easy to explain.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about the fascinating</p>
<p>and the difficult things about all of this.</p>
<p>So by the way, when you say rank order,</p>
<p>that means you get a number and that means one person,</p>
<p>you can now compare.</p>
<p>Like you could say that this other person</p>
<p>is more intelligent than me.</p>
<p>Well, what you can say is IQ scores</p>
<p>are interpreted really as percentiles.</p>
<p>So that if you have an IQ of 140</p>
<p>and somebody else has 70,</p>
<p>the metric is such that you cannot say</p>
<p>the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart</p>
<p>as a person with an IQ of 70.</p>
<p>That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.</p>
<p>Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence,</p>
<p>but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relative to other people.</p>
<p>So relative to other people,</p>
<p>somebody with an IQ score of 140</p>
<p>is in the upper less than 1%,</p>
<p>whereas somebody with an IQ of 70</p>
<p>is two standard deviations below the mean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different percentile.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s similar to like in chess,</p>
<p>you have an ELO rating that&rsquo;s designed to rank order people.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s twice one person.</p>
<p>If your ELO rating is twice another person,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re twice as good at chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stable in that way,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to do these kinds of comparisons.</p>
<p>But so what can we say about the number itself?</p>
<p>Is that stable across tests and so on, or no?</p>
<p>There are a number of statistical properties of any test.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called psychometric properties.</p>
<p>You have validity, you have reliability,</p>
<p>reliability, there are many different kinds of reliability.</p>
<p>They all essentially measure stability.</p>
<p>And IQ tests are stable within an individual.</p>
<p>There are some longitudinal studies</p>
<p>where children were measured at age 11.</p>
<p>And again, when they were 70 years old</p>
<p>and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.</p>
<p>This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test</p>
<p>on every single child age 11 in the whole country.</p>
<p>And they did.</p>
<p>And those records were discovered in an old storeroom</p>
<p>at the University of Edinburgh by a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,</p>
<p>and has done a lot of research</p>
<p>on the people who are still alive today</p>
<p>from that original study,</p>
<p>including brain imaging research, by the way.</p>
<p>It really, it&rsquo;s a fascinating group of people</p>
<p>who are studied.</p>
<p>Not to get ahead of the story,</p>
<p>but one of the most interesting things they found</p>
<p>is a very strong relationship</p>
<p>between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality.</p>
<p>So that, you know,</p>
<p>in the 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates</p>
<p>and they could get death records from everybody.</p>
<p>And Scotland has universal healthcare for everybody.</p>
<p>And it turned out if you divide the people</p>
<p>by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles</p>
<p>and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,</p>
<p>the, I know this is in the book,</p>
<p>I have the graph in the book,</p>
<p>but there are essentially twice as many people alive</p>
<p>in the highest IQ quartile than in the lowest IQ quartile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true in men and women.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So it makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Now, why this is the case is not so clear</p>
<p>since everyone had access to healthcare.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot, and we&rsquo;ll talk about it, you know,</p>
<p>just the sentences you used now</p>
<p>could be explained by nature or nurture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of science that starts to then dig in</p>
<p>and investigate that question.</p>
<p>But let me linger on the IQ test.</p>
<p>How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?</p>
<p>Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.</p>
<p>What makes a good IQ test question</p>
<p>that sneaks up on this G factor measure?</p>
<p>Well, your question is interesting</p>
<p>because you want me to give examples of items</p>
<p>that make good items.</p>
<p>And what makes a good item is not so much its content,</p>
<p>but its empirical relationship to the total score</p>
<p>that turns out to be valid by other means.</p>
<p>So for example, let me give you an odd example</p>
<p>from personality testing.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a personality test</p>
<p>called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, MMPI.</p>
<p>Been around for decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about this test recently</p>
<p>because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to that.</p>
<p>But they had psychologists.</p>
<p>I have not been paying attention to it.</p>
<p>They had psychologists on the stand,</p>
<p>and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m learning so much from this trial.</p>
<p>They did different battery of tests</p>
<p>to diagnose personality disorders.</p>
<p>Apparently there&rsquo;s that systematic way of doing so,</p>
<p>and the Minnesota one is one of the ones</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s the most science on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of great papers,</p>
<p>which were all continuously cited on the stand,</p>
<p>which is fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>Sorry, a little bit of attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, this is interesting because you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around for decades.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of scientific research</p>
<p>on the psychometric properties of the test,</p>
<p>including what it predicts with respect</p>
<p>to different categories of personality disorder.</p>
<p>But what I wanna mention is the content</p>
<p>of the items on that test.</p>
<p>All of the items are essentially true false items.</p>
<p>True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.</p>
<p>True or false, I think Lincoln</p>
<p>was a better president than Washington.</p>
<p>But what of all these, what does that have to do?</p>
<p>And the point is the content of these items,</p>
<p>nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything,</p>
<p>but empirically they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technique of choosing items for a test</p>
<p>that is called dust bowl empiricism.</p>
<p>That the content doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>but for some reason when you get a criterion group</p>
<p>of people with this disorder and you compare them</p>
<p>to people without that disorder,</p>
<p>these are the items that distinguish,</p>
<p>irrespective of content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard concept to grasp.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But from, because I consider myself part psychologist</p>
<p>because I love human robot interaction,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Half of that problem is a psychology problem</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a human.</p>
<p>So designing these tests to get at the questions</p>
<p>is the fascinating part.</p>
<p>Like how do you get to,</p>
<p>like what does dust bowl empiricism refer to?</p>
<p>Does it refer to the final result?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s the test is dust bowl empiricism.</p>
<p>But how do you arrive at the battery of questions?</p>
<p>I presume one of the things,</p>
<p>now again, I&rsquo;m going to the excellent testimony</p>
<p>in that trial, they explain it,</p>
<p>because they also, they explain the tests.</p>
<p>That a bunch of the questions are kind of</p>
<p>make you forget that you&rsquo;re taking a test.</p>
<p>Like it makes it very difficult for you</p>
<p>to somehow figure out what you&rsquo;re supposed to answer.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s called social desirability.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re getting a little far afield</p>
<p>because I only wanted to give that example</p>
<p>of dust bowl empiricism.</p>
<p>When we talk about the items on an IQ test,</p>
<p>many of those items in the dust bowl empiricism method</p>
<p>have no face validity.</p>
<p>In other words, they don&rsquo;t look like they measure anything.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Whereas most intelligence tests,</p>
<p>the items actually look like they&rsquo;re measuring</p>
<p>some mental ability.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s one of the.</p>
<p>So you were bringing that up as an example</p>
<p>as what it is not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to go too far afield on it.</p>
<p>Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast.</p>
<p>So I should mention that.</p>
<p>Far afield.</p>
<p>Yeah, so anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>So they feel the questions look like</p>
<p>they pass the face validity test.</p>
<p>And some more than others.</p>
<p>So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.</p>
<p>If I, one of the subtests on a standard IQ test</p>
<p>is general information.</p>
<p>Let me just think a little bit</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to give you the actual item.</p>
<p>But if I said, how far is it between Washington DC</p>
<p>and Miami, Florida?</p>
<p>Within 500 miles plus or minus.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s not a fact most people memorize,</p>
<p>but you know something about geography.</p>
<p>You say, well, I flew there once.</p>
<p>I know planes fly for 500 miles.</p>
<p>You know, you can kind of make an estimate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also seems like it would be very cultural,</p>
<p>you know, so there&rsquo;s that kind of general information.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s vocabulary test.</p>
<p>What does regatta mean?</p>
<p>And I choose that word because that word was removed</p>
<p>from the IQ test because people complained</p>
<p>that disadvantaged people would not know that word</p>
<p>just from their everyday life.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s another example</p>
<p>from a different kind of subtest on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s regatta, by the way?</p>
<p>Regatta is a.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m disadvantaged.</p>
<p>A sailing competition, a competition with boats.</p>
<p>Not necessarily sailing, but a competition with boats.</p>
<p>Yep, yep, I&rsquo;m probably disadvantaged in that way.</p>
<p>Okay, excellent, so that was removed anyway you were saying.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s another subtest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna repeat a string of numbers,</p>
<p>and when I&rsquo;m done, I want you to repeat them back to me.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Okay, seven, four, two, eight, one, six.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way too many.</p>
<p>Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.</p>
<p>Okay, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Now the actual test starts with a smaller number,</p>
<p>like two numbers, and then as people get it right,</p>
<p>you keep going, adding to the string of numbers</p>
<p>until they can&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, but now try this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say some numbers, and when I&rsquo;m done,</p>
<p>I want you to repeat them to me backwards.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>Okay, now, so I gave you some examples</p>
<p>of the kind of items on an IQ test.</p>
<p>General information, I can&rsquo;t even remember all,</p>
<p>general information, vocabulary, digit span forward</p>
<p>and digit span backward.</p>
<p>Well, you said I can&rsquo;t even remember them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question for me.</p>
<p>What does memory have to do with GFactor?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let&rsquo;s hold on.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just talk about these examples.</p>
<p>Now, some of those items seem very cultural,</p>
<p>and others seem less cultural.</p>
<p>Which ones do you think, scores on which subtest</p>
<p>are most highly correlated with the GFactor?</p>
<p>Well, the intuitive answer is less cultural.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated,</p>
<p>and it turns out that digit span backwards</p>
<p>is highly correlated.</p>
<p>How do you figure?</p>
<p>Now you have decades of research to answer the question,</p>
<p>how do you figure?</p>
<p>Right, so now there&rsquo;s good research that gives you</p>
<p>intuition about what kind of questions get at it,</p>
<p>just like there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually used for research in semi autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>like whether humans are paying attention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a body of literature that does end back test,</p>
<p>for example, we have to put workload on the brain</p>
<p>to do recall, memory recall, and that helps you</p>
<p>kind of put some work onto the brain</p>
<p>while the person is doing some other task,</p>
<p>and does some interesting research with that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s loading the memory,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s like research around stably</p>
<p>what that means about the human mind,</p>
<p>and here you&rsquo;re saying recall backwards</p>
<p>is a good protector.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transformation.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to do some,</p>
<p>like you have to load that into your brain,</p>
<p>and not just remember it, but do something with it.</p>
<p>Right, here&rsquo;s another example of a different kind of test</p>
<p>called the Hick paradigm, and it&rsquo;s not verbal at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little box, and there are a series of lights</p>
<p>arranged in a semi circle at the top of the box,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a home button that you press,</p>
<p>and when one of the lights goes on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a button next to each of those lights,</p>
<p>you take your finger off the home button,</p>
<p>and you just press the button</p>
<p>next to the light that goes on,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s a very simple reaction time.</p>
<p>Light goes on, as quick as you can, you press the button,</p>
<p>and you get a reaction time</p>
<p>from the moment you lift your finger off the button</p>
<p>to when you press the button where the light is.</p>
<p>That reaction time doesn&rsquo;t really correlate</p>
<p>with IQ very much, but if you change the instructions,</p>
<p>and you say three lights are gonna come on simultaneously,</p>
<p>I want you to press the button next to the light</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s furthest from the other two.</p>
<p>So maybe lights one and two go on,</p>
<p>and light six goes on simultaneously.</p>
<p>You take your finger off,</p>
<p>and you would press the button by light six.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that reaction time to a more complex task.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really hard.</p>
<p>Almost everybody gets it all right,</p>
<p>but your reaction time to that</p>
<p>is highly correlated with the G factor.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>So reaction time, so there&rsquo;s a temporal aspect to this.</p>
<p>So what role does time?</p>
<p>Speed of processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the speed of processing.</p>
<p>Is this also true for ones that take longer,</p>
<p>like five, 10, 30 seconds?</p>
<p>Is time part of the measure with some of these things?</p>
<p>Yes, and that is why some of the best IQ tests</p>
<p>have a time limit, because if you have no time limit,</p>
<p>people can do better,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t distinguish among people that well.</p>
<p>So that adding the time element is important.</p>
<p>So speed of information processing,</p>
<p>and reaction time is a measure</p>
<p>of speed of information processing,</p>
<p>turns out to be related to the G factor.</p>
<p>But the G factor only accounts for maybe half</p>
<p>or some amount on the test performance.</p>
<p>For example, I get pretty bad test anxiety.</p>
<p>Like I was never, I mean,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t enjoy tests.</p>
<p>I enjoy going back into my cave and working.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed homework way more than tests,</p>
<p>no matter how hard the homework is,</p>
<p>because I can go back to the cave</p>
<p>and hide away and think deeply.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about being watched</p>
<p>and having a time limit that really makes me anxious,</p>
<p>and I can just see the mind not operating optimally at all.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying underneath there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a G factor, there&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>No question, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>Boy.</p>
<p>And if you get anxious taking the test,</p>
<p>many people say, oh, I didn&rsquo;t do well,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m anxious.</p>
<p>I hear that a lot.</p>
<p>Say, well, fine, if you&rsquo;re really anxious during the test,</p>
<p>the score will be a bad estimate of your G factor.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean the G factor isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re essentially intelligence tests.</p>
<p>They are highly G loaded.</p>
<p>Now, the people who make the SAT don&rsquo;t wanna mention that.</p>
<p>They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing,</p>
<p>but to call it an intelligence test</p>
<p>is really beyond the pale.</p>
<p>But in fact, it&rsquo;s so highly correlated,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a reasoning test.</p>
<p>SAT is a reasoning test,</p>
<p>a verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a reasoning test, it has to be related to G.</p>
<p>But if people go in and take a standardized test,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s an IQ test or the SAT,</p>
<p>and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever,</p>
<p>the score is not going to be a good estimate of their G.</p>
<p>If they retake the test when they&rsquo;re not anxious</p>
<p>or less anxious or don&rsquo;t have a fever,</p>
<p>the score will go up, and that will be a better estimate.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t say their G factor increased</p>
<p>between the two tests.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So the question is how wide of a battery of tests</p>
<p>is required to estimate the G factor well?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ll give you as my personal example,</p>
<p>I took the SAT in, I think it was called the ACT,</p>
<p>where I was two, also, I took SAT many times.</p>
<p>Every single time, I got it perfect on math.</p>
<p>And verbal, the time limit on the verbal</p>
<p>made me very anxious.</p>
<p>I did not, I mean, part of it,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t speak English very well.</p>
<p>But honestly, it was like you&rsquo;re supposed to remember stuff,</p>
<p>and I was so anxious.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m reading, I&rsquo;m sweating, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know that feeling you have when you&rsquo;re reading a book</p>
<p>and you just read a page and you know nothing</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;ve read because you zoned out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same feeling of like, I can&rsquo;t, I have to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, nope, read and understand.</p>
<p>And that anxiety is like, and you start seeing</p>
<p>like the typography versus the content of the words.</p>
<p>Like that was, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because I know that what they&rsquo;re measuring,</p>
<p>I could see being correlated with something.</p>
<p>But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance</p>
<p>sure plays a factor.</p>
<p>And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a broader discussion</p>
<p>about like standardized testing, how you sneak up,</p>
<p>how you get at the fact that I&rsquo;m super anxious</p>
<p>and still nevertheless measure some aspect</p>
<p>of my ontology.</p>
<p>I wonder, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can say to that,</p>
<p>that time limit sure is a pain.</p>
<p>Well, let me say this.</p>
<p>There are two ways to approach the very real problem</p>
<p>that you say that some people just get anxious</p>
<p>or not good test takers.</p>
<p>By the way, part of testing is you know the answer,</p>
<p>you can figure out the answer or you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the answer, there are many reasons</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know the answer at that particular moment.</p>
<p>You may have learned it once and forgotten it.</p>
<p>It may be on the tip of your tongue</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re anxious about the time limit.</p>
<p>You may never have learned it.</p>
<p>You may have been exposed to it,</p>
<p>but it was too complicated and you couldn&rsquo;t learn it.</p>
<p>I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here.</p>
<p>But for an individual to interpret your scores</p>
<p>as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score</p>
<p>has to take into account various things</p>
<p>that would affect your individual score.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why decisions about college admission</p>
<p>or anything else where tests are used</p>
<p>are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.</p>
<p>And I think people are, college admissions</p>
<p>letting go of that very much.</p>
<p>Oh yes, yeah.</p>
<p>But what does that even mean?</p>
<p>Because is it possible to design standardized tests</p>
<p>that do get, that are useful to college admissions?</p>
<p>Well, they already exist.</p>
<p>The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects</p>
<p>of success at college.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>So maybe you could speak to this.</p>
<p>The correlation across the population versus individuals.</p>
<p>So our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,</p>
<p>wow, it&rsquo;s still, there&rsquo;s tragic cases</p>
<p>where innocent people go to jail,</p>
<p>but you try to avoid that.</p>
<p>And the same way with testing,</p>
<p>it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s statistically unlikely.</p>
<p>So it really comes down to which piece of information</p>
<p>maximizes your decision making ability.</p>
<p>So if you just use high school grades, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But you will miss some people</p>
<p>who just don&rsquo;t do well in high school,</p>
<p>but who are actually pretty smart,</p>
<p>smart enough to be bored silly in high school,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>and their high school GPA isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>So you will miss them in the same sense</p>
<p>that somebody who could be very able and ready for college</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t do well on their SAT.</p>
<p>This is why you make decisions</p>
<p>with taking in a variety of information.</p>
<p>The other thing I wanted to say,</p>
<p>I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,</p>
<p>statistically for groups,</p>
<p>there are many people who have a disparity</p>
<p>between their math score and their verbal score.</p>
<p>That disparity, or the other way around,</p>
<p>that disparity is called tilt.</p>
<p>The score is tilted one way or the other.</p>
<p>And that tilt has been studied empirically</p>
<p>to see what that predicts.</p>
<p>And in fact, you can&rsquo;t make predictions</p>
<p>about college success based on tilt.</p>
<p>And mathematics is a good example.</p>
<p>There are many people,</p>
<p>especially non native speakers of English</p>
<p>who come to this country,</p>
<p>take the SATs, do very well on the math</p>
<p>and not so well on the verbal.</p>
<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re applying to a math program,</p>
<p>the professors there who are making the decision</p>
<p>or the admissions officers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wait so much to score on verbal,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a non native speaker.</p>
<p>Well, so yeah, you have to try to,</p>
<p>in the admission process, bring in the context.</p>
<p>But non native isn&rsquo;t really the problem.</p>
<p>I mean, that was part of the problem for me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the anxiety was, which it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Oh boy, reducing yourself down to numbers.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a painful truth.</p>
<p>That same anxiety that led me to be,</p>
<p>to struggle with the SAT verbal tests</p>
<p>is still within me in all ways of life.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s not anxiety.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s something, like personality</p>
<p>is also pretty stable.</p>
<p>Personality is stable.</p>
<p>Personality does impact the way you navigate life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we should say that the G factor in intelligence</p>
<p>is not just about some kind of number on a paper.</p>
<p>It also has to do with how you navigate life.</p>
<p>How easy life is for you in this very complicated world.</p>
<p>So personality&rsquo;s all tied into that</p>
<p>in some deep fundamental way.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;ve hit the key point</p>
<p>about why we even want to study intelligence.</p>
<p>And personality, I think, to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my interest, is more on intelligence.</p>
<p>I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of another story</p>
<p>how I got kind of shifted from personality research</p>
<p>over to intelligence research.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just a number.</p>
<p>Intelligence is not just an IQ score.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an SAT score.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what those numbers reflect about your ability</p>
<p>to navigate everyday life.</p>
<p>It has been said that life is one long intelligence test.</p>
<p>And who can&rsquo;t relate to that?</p>
<p>And if you doubt, see, another problem here</p>
<p>is a lot of critics of intelligence research,</p>
<p>intelligence testing, tend to be academics</p>
<p>who, by and large, are pretty smart people.</p>
<p>And pretty smart people, by and large,</p>
<p>have enormous difficulty understanding</p>
<p>what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75.</p>
<p>It is a completely different everyday experience.</p>
<p>Even IQ scores of 85, 90.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a popular television program, Judge Judy.</p>
<p>Judge Judy deals with everyday people</p>
<p>with everyday problems, and you can see the full range</p>
<p>of problem solving ability demonstrated there.</p>
<p>And sometimes she does it for laughs,</p>
<p>but it really isn&rsquo;t funny because people who are,</p>
<p>there are people who are very limited</p>
<p>in their life navigation, let alone success,</p>
<p>by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught.</p>
<p>We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts.</p>
<p>You know, the United States military,</p>
<p>which excels at training people,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a better organization</p>
<p>in the world for training diverse people,</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t take people with IQs under,</p>
<p>I think, 83 is the cutoff, because they have found</p>
<p>they are unable to train people with lower IQs</p>
<p>to do jobs in the military.</p>
<p>So one of the things that G Factor has to do is learning.</p>
<p>Absolutely, some people learn faster than others.</p>
<p>Some people learn more than others.</p>
<p>Now, faster, by the way, is not necessarily better,</p>
<p>as long as you get to the same place eventually.</p>
<p>But, you know, there are professional schools</p>
<p>that want students who can learn the fastest</p>
<p>because they can learn more or learn better.</p>
<p>Or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas</p>
<p>about why you select people with the highest scores.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing funnier, by the way,</p>
<p>to listen to a bunch of academics</p>
<p>complain about the concept of intelligence</p>
<p>and intelligence testing, and then you go</p>
<p>to a faculty meeting where they&rsquo;re discussing</p>
<p>who to hire among the applicants.</p>
<p>And all they talk about is how smart the person is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that, we&rsquo;ll sneak up to that in different ways,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about reducing a person</p>
<p>to a number that in part is grounded</p>
<p>to the person&rsquo;s genetics that makes people very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But nobody does that.</p>
<p>Nobody in the field actually does that.</p>
<p>That is a worry that is a worry like,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t wanna call it a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a legitimate worry,</p>
<p>but it just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Now, I had a professor in graduate school</p>
<p>who was the only person I ever knew</p>
<p>who considered the students only by their test scores.</p>
<p>And later in his life, he kind of backed off that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, so we&rsquo;ll jump around,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to it, but I tend to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had like political discussions with people</p>
<p>and actually my friend Michael Malice, he&rsquo;s an anarchist.</p>
<p>I disagree with him on basically everything</p>
<p>except the fact that love is a beautiful thing in this world.</p>
<p>And he says this test about left versus right,</p>
<p>whatever, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the test is,</p>
<p>but he believes, the question is,</p>
<p>do you believe that some people are better than others?</p>
<p>Question is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Do you believe some people are better than others?</p>
<p>And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a poetic question, it&rsquo;s an ambiguous question, right?</p>
<p>Like people wanna maybe the temptation</p>
<p>to ask better at what, better at like sports and so on.</p>
<p>No, to me, I stand with the sort of defining documents</p>
<p>of this country, which is all men are created equal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a basic humanity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about tests of intelligence.</p>
<p>Just knowing that some people are different,</p>
<p>like the science of intelligence that shows</p>
<p>that some people are genetically</p>
<p>in some stable way across a lifetime,</p>
<p>have a greater intelligence than others,</p>
<p>makes people feel like some people are better than others.</p>
<p>And that makes them very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And I, maybe you can speak to that.</p>
<p>The fact that some people are more intelligent than others</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s, cannot be compensated</p>
<p>through education, through anything you do in life.</p>
<p>What do we do with that?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a lot there.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really talked about the genetics of it yet.</p>
<p>But you are correct in that it is my interpretation</p>
<p>of the data that genetics has a very important influence</p>
<p>on the G factor.</p>
<p>And this is controversial, and we can talk about it,</p>
<p>but if you think that genetics,</p>
<p>that genes are deterministic, are always deterministic,</p>
<p>that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.</p>
<p>But we know now in the 21st century</p>
<p>that many genes are not deterministic,</p>
<p>that are probabilistic,</p>
<p>meaning their gene expression can be influenced.</p>
<p>Now, whether they&rsquo;re influenced only</p>
<p>by other biological variables or other genetic variables</p>
<p>or environmental or cultural variables,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the controversy comes in.</p>
<p>And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.</p>
<p>But to go to the question about better, are people better?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero evidence that smart people are better</p>
<p>with respect to important aspects of life,</p>
<p>like honesty, even likability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know many very intelligent people</p>
<p>who are not terribly likable or terribly kind</p>
<p>or terribly honest.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said?</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;ve recently reread</p>
<p>for the second time, I guess that&rsquo;s what the word reread</p>
<p>means, the rise and fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>which is, I think, the best telling</p>
<p>of the rise and fall of Hitler.</p>
<p>And one of the interesting things about the people that,</p>
<p>how should I say it?</p>
<p>Justified or maybe propped up the ideas</p>
<p>that Hitler put forward is the fact</p>
<p>that they were extremely intelligent.</p>
<p>They were the intellectual class.</p>
<p>They were like, it was obvious that they thought</p>
<p>very deeply and rationally about the world.</p>
<p>So what I would like to say is one of the things</p>
<p>that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities</p>
<p>in the history of humanity have been committed</p>
<p>by very intelligent people.</p>
<p>So that means that intelligence</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you a good person.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a G factor for intelligence.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a G factor for goodness.</p>
<p>The Nietzschean good and evil,</p>
<p>of course that&rsquo;s probably harder to measure</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a subjective thing</p>
<p>what it means to be good.</p>
<p>And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing</p>
<p>because how do we know?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s independent, whatever it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s independent of intelligence.</p>
<p>So I agree with you about that.</p>
<p>But let me say this.</p>
<p>I have also asserted my belief</p>
<p>that more intelligence is better than less.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean more intelligent people are better people</p>
<p>but all things being equal,</p>
<p>would you like to be smarter or less smart?</p>
<p>So if I had a pill, I have two pills.</p>
<p>I said, this one will make you smarter,</p>
<p>this one will make you dumber.</p>
<p>Which one would you like?</p>
<p>Are there any circumstances</p>
<p>under which you would choose to be dumber?</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very nuanced and interesting question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been books written about this, right?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll return to the hard questions,</p>
<p>the interesting questions,</p>
<p>but let me ask about human happiness.</p>
<p>Does intelligence lead to happiness?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So, okay, so back to the pill then.</p>
<p>So when would you take the pill?</p>
<p>So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110,</p>
<p>you start going through the quartiles</p>
<p>and is it obvious?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there diminishing returns</p>
<p>and then it starts becoming negative?</p>
<p>This is an empirical question.</p>
<p>And so that I have advocated in many forums</p>
<p>more research on enhancing the G factor.</p>
<p>Right now there have been many claims</p>
<p>about enhancing intelligence with,</p>
<p>you mentioned the NBAC training,</p>
<p>it was a big deal a few years ago, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Data is very clear, it does not work.</p>
<p>Or doing like memory tests, like training and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t impact your G factor.</p>
<p>It was very popular a couple of decades ago</p>
<p>that the idea that listening to Mozart</p>
<p>could make you more intelligent.</p>
<p>There was a paper published on this</p>
<p>with somebody I knew published this paper,</p>
<p>and intelligence researchers never believed it for a second.</p>
<p>Been hundreds of studies, all the meta analyses,</p>
<p>all the summaries and so on,</p>
<p>show that there&rsquo;s nothing to it, nothing to it at all.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t it be something,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be world shaking</p>
<p>if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t really talked about yet,</p>
<p>but IQ scores and the G factor</p>
<p>is thought to be a normal distribution,</p>
<p>and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter?</p>
<p>Even a half a standard deviation would be world shaking,</p>
<p>because there are many social problems,</p>
<p>many, many social problems that are exacerbated</p>
<p>by people with lower ability to reason stuff out</p>
<p>and navigate everyday life.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a threshold.</p>
<p>So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting</p>
<p>of the normal distribution</p>
<p>may not be the optimal way of shifting.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s better to,</p>
<p>whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions</p>
<p>is like really pushing the lower up</p>
<p>versus trying to make the people</p>
<p>at the average more intelligent.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that if in fact</p>
<p>there was some way to increase G,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,</p>
<p>we should only give it to people at the lower end.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just intuitively I can see</p>
<p>that life becomes easier at the lower end if it&rsquo;s increased.</p>
<p>It becomes less and less,</p>
<p>it is an empirical scientific question,</p>
<p>but it becomes less and less obvious to me</p>
<p>that more intelligence is better.</p>
<p>At the high end, not because it would make life easier,</p>
<p>but it would make whatever problems you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>more solvable.</p>
<p>And if you are working on artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous potential for that to improve society.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>So at whatever problems you&rsquo;re working on, yes.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the problem of the human condition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s love, there&rsquo;s fear,</p>
<p>and all of those beautiful things</p>
<p>that sometimes if you&rsquo;re good at solving problems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to create more problems for yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>So ignorance is bliss is a thing.</p>
<p>So there might be a place,</p>
<p>there might be a sweet spot of intelligence</p>
<p>given your environment, given your personality,</p>
<p>all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And that becomes less beautifully complicated</p>
<p>the more and more intelligent you become.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a question for literature,</p>
<p>not for science perhaps.</p>
<p>Well, imagine this.</p>
<p>Imagine there was an IQ pill</p>
<p>and it was developed by a private company</p>
<p>and they are willing to sell it to you.</p>
<p>And whatever price they put on it,</p>
<p>you are willing to pay it</p>
<p>because you would like to be smarter.</p>
<p>But just before they give you a pill,</p>
<p>they give you a disclaimer form to sign.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold us,</p>
<p>you understand that this pill has no guarantee</p>
<p>that your life is going to be better</p>
<p>and in fact it could be worse.</p>
<p>Well, yes, that&rsquo;s how lawyers work.</p>
<p>But I would love for science to answer the question</p>
<p>to try to predict if your life</p>
<p>is going to be better or worse</p>
<p>when you become more or less intelligent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating question</p>
<p>about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.</p>
<p>Some of the things we see as bugs</p>
<p>might be actually features,</p>
<p>may be crucial to our overall happiness</p>
<p>as our limitations might lead to more happiness than less.</p>
<p>But again, more intelligence is better at the lower end.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s less arguable</p>
<p>and fascinating if possible to increase.</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s virtually no research</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on a neuroscience approach</p>
<p>to solving that problem.</p>
<p>All the solutions that have been proposed</p>
<p>to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem</p>
<p>are essentially based on the blank slate assumption</p>
<p>that enriching the environment, removing barriers,</p>
<p>all good things by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against any of those things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no empirical evidence</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to improve the general reasoning ability</p>
<p>or make people more employable.</p>
<p>Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to the question of intelligence and happiness.</p>
<p>There are many profound aspects of that story.</p>
<p>It was a film that was very good.</p>
<p>The film was called Charlie</p>
<p>for the younger people who are listening to this.</p>
<p>You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something,</p>
<p>but it was a story about a person</p>
<p>with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure</p>
<p>in the brain and he slowly became a genius.</p>
<p>And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating story really.</p>
<p>That goes in contrast to the basic human experience</p>
<p>that each of us individually have,</p>
<p>but it raises the question of the full range of people</p>
<p>you might be able to be given different levels</p>
<p>of intelligence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the normal distribution.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994,</p>
<p>written by psychologist Richard Herrnstein</p>
<p>and political scientist Charles Murray.</p>
<p>Why was this book so controversial?</p>
<p>This is a fascinating book.</p>
<p>I know Charles Murray.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many conversations with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is the book about?</p>
<p>The book is about the importance of intelligence</p>
<p>in everyday life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the book is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an empirical book.</p>
<p>It has statistical analyses of very large databases</p>
<p>that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent</p>
<p>are correlated to all kinds of social problems</p>
<p>and social benefits.</p>
<p>And that in itself is not where the controversy</p>
<p>about that book came.</p>
<p>The controversy was about one chapter in that book.</p>
<p>And that is a chapter about the average difference</p>
<p>in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.</p>
<p>And these are the terms that were used in the book</p>
<p>at the time and are still used to some extent.</p>
<p>And historically, or really for decades,</p>
<p>it has been observed that disadvantaged groups</p>
<p>score on average lower than Caucasians</p>
<p>on academic tests, tests of mental ability,</p>
<p>and especially on IQ tests.</p>
<p>And the difference is about a standard deviation,</p>
<p>which is about 15 points, which is a substantial difference.</p>
<p>In the book, Herrnstein and Murray in this one chapter</p>
<p>assert clearly and unambiguously</p>
<p>that whether this average difference</p>
<p>is due to genetics or not, they are agnostic.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Moreover, they assert they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>because you wouldn&rsquo;t treat anybody differently</p>
<p>knowing if there was a genetic component or not</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a group average finding.</p>
<p>Every individual has to be treated as an individual.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make any assumption</p>
<p>about what that person&rsquo;s intellectual ability might be</p>
<p>from the fact of a average group difference.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very clear about this.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, people took away,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna choose my words carefully</p>
<p>because I have a feeling that many critics</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t actually read the book.</p>
<p>They took away that Herrnstein and Murray were saying</p>
<p>that blacks are genetically inferior.</p>
<p>That was the take home message.</p>
<p>And if they weren&rsquo;t saying it, they were implying it</p>
<p>because they had a chapter that discussed</p>
<p>this empirical observation of a difference.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t this horrible?</p>
<p>And so the reaction to that book was incendiary.</p>
<p>What do we know about from that book</p>
<p>and the research beyond about race differences</p>
<p>and intelligence?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the most incendiary topic in psychology.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed that.</p>
<p>Anybody who even discusses it is easily called a racist</p>
<p>just for discussing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become fashionable to find racism</p>
<p>in any discussion like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>The short answer to your question is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been very little actual research</p>
<p>on this topic since 19&hellip;</p>
<p>Since the bell curve.</p>
<p>Since the bell curve, even before.</p>
<p>This really became incendiary in 1969</p>
<p>with an article published by an educational psychologist</p>
<p>named Arthur Jensen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take a minute and go back to that</p>
<p>to see the bell curve in a little bit more</p>
<p>historical perspective.</p>
<p>Arthur Jensen was a educational psychologist</p>
<p>at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>I knew him as well.</p>
<p>And in 1969 or 68, the Harvard Educational Review</p>
<p>asked him to do a review article</p>
<p>on the early childhood education programs</p>
<p>that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.</p>
<p>This was before the federally funded Head Start program.</p>
<p>Head Start had not really gotten underway</p>
<p>at the time Jensen undertook his review</p>
<p>of what were a number of demonstration programs.</p>
<p>And these demonstration programs were for young children</p>
<p>who were around kindergarten age.</p>
<p>And they were specially designed to be</p>
<p>cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,</p>
<p>do all the things that people thought would</p>
<p>minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.</p>
<p>There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists</p>
<p>that the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity</p>
<p>due to racism, due to all negative things in the society.</p>
<p>And if you could compensate for this, the gap would go away.</p>
<p>So early childhood education back then was called</p>
<p>literally compensatory education.</p>
<p>Jensen looked at these programs.</p>
<p>He was an empirical guy.</p>
<p>He understood psychometrics.</p>
<p>And he wrote a, it was over a hundred page article</p>
<p>detailing these programs</p>
<p>and the flaws in their research design.</p>
<p>Some of the programs reported IQ gains</p>
<p>of on average five points,</p>
<p>but a few reported 10, 20 and even 30 point gains.</p>
<p>One was called the miracle in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>That investigator went to jail ultimately</p>
<p>for fabricating data.</p>
<p>But the point is that Jensen wrote an article that said,</p>
<p>look, the opening sentence of his article is classic.</p>
<p>The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, we have tried compensatory education</p>
<p>and it has failed.</p>
<p>And he showed that these gains were essentially nothing.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really document empirically any gains at all</p>
<p>from these really earnest efforts to increase IQ.</p>
<p>But he went a step further, a fateful step further.</p>
<p>He said, not only have these efforts failed,</p>
<p>but because they have had essentially no impact,</p>
<p>we have to reexamine our assumption</p>
<p>that these differences are caused by environmental things</p>
<p>that we can address with education.</p>
<p>We need to consider a genetic influence,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a genetic influence</p>
<p>on this group difference.</p>
<p>So you said that this is one of the more controversial works</p>
<p>ever in science. I think it&rsquo;s the most infamous paper</p>
<p>in all of psychology, I would go on to say.</p>
<p>Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy</p>
<p>on this question, skimpy and controversial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been controversial,</p>
<p>but it was even skimpy and controversial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a long story that I go into a little bit</p>
<p>in more detail in the book, Neuroscience of Intelligence.</p>
<p>But to say he was vilified is an understatement.</p>
<p>I mean, he couldn&rsquo;t talk at the American</p>
<p>Psychological Association without bomb threats</p>
<p>clearing the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Campus security watched him all the time.</p>
<p>They opened his mail.</p>
<p>He had to retreat to a different address.</p>
<p>This was one of the earliest kinds,</p>
<p>this is before the internet</p>
<p>and kind of internet social media mobs.</p>
<p>But it was that intense.</p>
<p>And I have written that overnight,</p>
<p>after the publication of this article,</p>
<p>all intelligence research became radioactive.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to talk about it.</p>
<p>Nobody was doing more research.</p>
<p>And then the bell curve came along.</p>
<p>And the Jensen controversy was dying down.</p>
<p>I have stories that Jensen told me about his interaction</p>
<p>with the Nixon White House on this issue.</p>
<p>I mean, this was like a really big deal.</p>
<p>It was some unbelievable stories,</p>
<p>but he told me this, so I kind of believe these stories.</p>
<p>Nonetheless.</p>
<p>25 years later.</p>
<p>All this silence, basically, saying,</p>
<p>nobody wants to do this kind of research.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much pressure, so much attack</p>
<p>against this kind of research.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people</p>
<p>that decide to dive right back in.</p>
<p>I wonder how much discussion that was.</p>
<p>Do we include this chapter or not?</p>
<p>Murray has said they discussed it,</p>
<p>and they felt they should include it.</p>
<p>And they were very careful in the way they wrote it,</p>
<p>which did them no good.</p>
<p>So, as a matter of fact, when the bell curve came out,</p>
<p>it was so controversial.</p>
<p>I got a call from a television show called Nightline.</p>
<p>It was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel.</p>
<p>We had this evening show, I think it was on late at night.</p>
<p>Talked about news.</p>
<p>It was a straight up news thing.</p>
<p>And a producer called and asked if I would be on it</p>
<p>to talk about the bell curve.</p>
<p>And I said, she asked me what I thought</p>
<p>about the bell curve as a book.</p>
<p>And I said, look, it&rsquo;s a very good book.</p>
<p>It talks about the role of intelligence in society.</p>
<p>And she said, no, no, what do you think</p>
<p>about the chapter on race?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want you to talk about.</p>
<p>I remember this conversation.</p>
<p>I said, well, she said, what would you say</p>
<p>if you were on TV?</p>
<p>And I said, well, what I would say is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not at all clear if there&rsquo;s any genetic component</p>
<p>to intelligence, any differences.</p>
<p>But if there were a strong genetic component,</p>
<p>that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>And complete silence on the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>And she said, well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And I said, well, if it&rsquo;s the more genetic</p>
<p>any difference is, the more it&rsquo;s biological.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s biological, we can figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>I see, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>She said, would you say that on television?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I said, no.</p>
<p>And so that was the end of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for more like biology is within the reach</p>
<p>of science and the environment is a public policy,</p>
<p>is social and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>From your perspective, whichever one you think</p>
<p>is more amenable to solutions in the short term</p>
<p>is the one that excites you.</p>
<p>But you saying that is good, the truth of genetic differences,</p>
<p>no matter what, between groups is a painful, harmful,</p>
<p>potentially dangerous thing.</p>
<p>So let me ask you to this question,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s bell curve or any research</p>
<p>on race differences, can that be used to increase</p>
<p>the amount of racism in the world?</p>
<p>Can that be used to increase the amount of hate</p>
<p>in the world?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this a lot, not as a scientist,</p>
<p>but as a person.</p>
<p>And my sense is there is such enormous reservoirs</p>
<p>of hate and racism that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with scientific knowledge of the data,</p>
<p>that speak against that.</p>
<p>That no, I don&rsquo;t wanna give racist groups a veto power</p>
<p>over what scientists study.</p>
<p>If you think that the differences, and by the way,</p>
<p>virtually no one disagrees that there are differences</p>
<p>in scores, it&rsquo;s all about what causes them</p>
<p>and how to fix it.</p>
<p>So if you think this is a cultural problem,</p>
<p>then you must ask the problem,</p>
<p>what do you want to change anything about the culture?</p>
<p>Or are you okay with the culture?</p>
<p>Cause you don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s appropriate</p>
<p>to change a person&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>So are you okay with that?</p>
<p>And the fact that that may lead to disadvantages</p>
<p>in school achievement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question.</p>
<p>If you think it&rsquo;s environmental,</p>
<p>what are the environmental parameters that can be fixed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Lead in paint, lead in water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an environmental toxin that society</p>
<p>has the means to eliminate, and they should.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to sort of try and define some insights</p>
<p>and conclusion to this very difficult topic.</p>
<p>Is there been research on environment versus genetics,</p>
<p>nature versus nurture, on this question</p>
<p>of race differences?</p>
<p>There is not, no one wants to do this research.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s hard research to do.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&rsquo;s a minefield.</p>
<p>No one wants to spend their career on it.</p>
<p>Tenured people don&rsquo;t want to do it, let alone students.</p>
<p>The way I talk about it,</p>
<p>well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,</p>
<p>I want to say one more thing about Jensen.</p>
<p>He was once asked by a journalist straight out,</p>
<p>are you a racist?</p>
<p>His answer was very interesting.</p>
<p>His answer was, I&rsquo;ve thought about that a lot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve concluded it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Now, I know what he meant by this.</p>
<p>The guts to say that, wow.</p>
<p>He was a very unusual person.</p>
<p>I think he had a touch of Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome,</p>
<p>to tell you the truth,</p>
<p>because I saw him in many circumstances.</p>
<p>He would be canceled on Twitter immediately</p>
<p>with that sentence.</p>
<p>But what he meant was he had a hypothesis,</p>
<p>and with respect to group differences,</p>
<p>he called it the default hypothesis.</p>
<p>He said, whatever factors affect individual intelligence</p>
<p>are likely the same factors that affect group differences.</p>
<p>It was the default.</p>
<p>But it was a hypothesis.</p>
<p>It should be tested, and if it turned out</p>
<p>empirical tests didn&rsquo;t support the hypothesis,</p>
<p>he was happy to move on to something else.</p>
<p>He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s an empirical question,</p>
<p>we should look at it, and let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>The scientific method cannot be racist,</p>
<p>from his perspective.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the scientists,</p>
<p>if they follow the scientific method,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they believe.</p>
<p>And if they are biased, and they consciously</p>
<p>or unconsciously bias the data,</p>
<p>other people will come along to replicate it,</p>
<p>they will fail, and the process over time will work.</p>
<p>So let me push back on this idea.</p>
<p>Because psychology to me is full of gray areas.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve observed about psychology,</p>
<p>even replication crisis aside,</p>
<p>is that something about the media,</p>
<p>something about journalism,</p>
<p>something about the virality of ideas in the public sphere,</p>
<p>they misinterpret, they take up things from studies,</p>
<p>willfully or from ignorance, misinterpret findings,</p>
<p>and tell narratives around that.</p>
<p>I personally believe, for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that broadly about science,</p>
<p>but for me, it&rsquo;s my responsibility to anticipate</p>
<p>the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>So I thought about this a lot,</p>
<p>because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>and those cars, people die in cars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that have written me letters saying emails,</p>
<p>nobody writes letters, I wish they did,</p>
<p>that have blood on my hands,</p>
<p>because of things that I would say positive or negative,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s consequences.</p>
<p>In the same way, when you&rsquo;re a researcher of intelligence,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you might get emails,</p>
<p>or at least people might believe</p>
<p>that a finding of your study is going to be used</p>
<p>by a large number of people</p>
<p>to increase the amount of hate in the world.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some responsibility on scientists,</p>
<p>but for me, I think there&rsquo;s a great responsibility</p>
<p>to anticipate the ways things will be misinterpreted,</p>
<p>and there, you have to, first of all,</p>
<p>decide whether you want to say a thing at all,</p>
<p>do the study at all, publish the study at all,</p>
<p>and two, the words with which you explain it.</p>
<p>I find this on Twitter a lot, actually,</p>
<p>which is, when I write a tweet,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m usually just doing it so innocently,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write it, it takes me five seconds to write it,</p>
<p>or whatever, 30 seconds to write it,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll think, all right, I close my eyes open,</p>
<p>and try to see how will the world interpret this,</p>
<p>what are the ways in which this will be misinterpreted,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll sometimes adjust that tweet to see,</p>
<p>yeah, so in my mind, it&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s my mind from which this tweet came,</p>
<p>but you have to think, in a fresh mind that sees this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s spread across a large number of other minds,</p>
<p>how will the interpretation morph?</p>
<p>I mean, for a tweet, it&rsquo;s a silly thing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>but for a scientific paper and study and finding,</p>
<p>I think it matters.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are on that,</p>
<p>because maybe for Jensen, the data&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>This is a scientific process that&rsquo;s been carried out,</p>
<p>if you think the data was polluted by bias,</p>
<p>do other studies that reveal the bias,</p>
<p>but the data&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a poet, I&rsquo;m not a literary writer,</p>
<p>what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just presenting you the data.</p>
<p>What do you think on that spectrum?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of a scientist?</p>
<p>The reason I do podcasts,</p>
<p>the reason I write books for the public</p>
<p>is to explain what I think the data mean</p>
<p>and what I think the data don&rsquo;t mean.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do very much on Twitter other than to retweet</p>
<p>references to papers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s my role to explain these,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re complicated, they&rsquo;re nuanced.</p>
<p>But when you decide not to do a scientific study</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, or not to publish a result</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re afraid the result could be harmful</p>
<p>or insensitive, that&rsquo;s not an unreasonable thought.</p>
<p>And people will make different conclusions</p>
<p>and decisions about that.</p>
<p>I wrote about this, I&rsquo;m the editor</p>
<p>of a journal called Intelligence,</p>
<p>which publishes scientific papers.</p>
<p>Sometimes we publish papers on group differences.</p>
<p>Those papers sometimes are controversial.</p>
<p>These papers are written for a scientific audience.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not written for the Twitter audience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t promote them very much on Twitter.</p>
<p>But in a scientific paper,</p>
<p>you have to now choose your words carefully also,</p>
<p>because those papers are picked up by non scientists,</p>
<p>by writers of various kinds,</p>
<p>and you have to be available to discuss what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re not saying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are successful at having a good conversation</p>
<p>like we are today, that doesn&rsquo;t start out pejorative.</p>
<p>Other times I&rsquo;ve been asked to participate in debates</p>
<p>where my role would be to justify race science.</p>
<p>Well, you can see you start out.</p>
<p>That was a BBC request that I received.</p>
<p>I have so much, it&rsquo;s a love hate relationship,</p>
<p>mostly hate with these shallow journalism organizations.</p>
<p>So they would want to use you</p>
<p>as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate</p>
<p>as to like there is raised differences between groups</p>
<p>and make that into debate and put you in a role of&hellip;</p>
<p>Justifying racism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking me to do.</p>
<p>Courses like educating about this field</p>
<p>of the science of intelligence, yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna say one more thing</p>
<p>before we get off the normal distribution.</p>
<p>You also asked me what is the science after the bell curve?</p>
<p>And the short answer is there&rsquo;s not much new work,</p>
<p>but whatever work there is supports the idea</p>
<p>that there still are group differences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arguable whether those differences</p>
<p>have diminished at all or not.</p>
<p>And there is still a major problem</p>
<p>in underperformance for school achievement</p>
<p>for many disadvantaged and minority students.</p>
<p>And there so far is no way to fix it.</p>
<p>What do we do with this information?</p>
<p>Is this now a task?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll talk about the future</p>
<p>on the neuroscience and the biology side,</p>
<p>but in terms of this information as a society</p>
<p>in the public policy, in the political space,</p>
<p>in the social space, what do we do with this information?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this.</p>
<p>The first step is to have people interested in policy</p>
<p>understand what the data actually show</p>
<p>to pay attention to intelligence data.</p>
<p>You can read policy papers about education</p>
<p>and using your word processor,</p>
<p>you can search for the word intelligence.</p>
<p>You can search a 20,000 word document in a second</p>
<p>and find out the word intelligence does not appear anywhere.</p>
<p>In most discussions about what to do about achievement gaps,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about test gaps,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about actual achievement gaps in schools,</p>
<p>which everyone agrees is a problem,</p>
<p>the word intelligence doesn&rsquo;t appear among educators.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, in California,</p>
<p>there has been tremendous controversy</p>
<p>about recent attempts to revise the curriculum</p>
<p>for math in high schools.</p>
<p>And we had a Stanford professor of education</p>
<p>who was running this review assert</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as talent, mathematical talent.</p>
<p>And she wanted to get rid of the advanced classes in math</p>
<p>because not everyone could do that.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this has been very controversial,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve retreated somewhat,</p>
<p>but the idea that a university professor</p>
<p>was in charge of this who believes</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no talent, that it doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>this is rather shocking,</p>
<p>let alone the complete absence of intelligence data.</p>
<p>By the way, let me tell you something</p>
<p>about what the intelligence data show.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take race out of it.</p>
<p>Even though the origins of these studies</p>
<p>were a long time ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blocking on the name of the report,</p>
<p>the Coleman report was a famous report about education.</p>
<p>And they measured all kinds of variables about schools,</p>
<p>about teachers,</p>
<p>and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome.</p>
<p>And they found the most predictive variables</p>
<p>of education outcome were the variables</p>
<p>the student brought with him or her into the school,</p>
<p>essentially their ability.</p>
<p>And that when you combine the school</p>
<p>and the teacher variables together,</p>
<p>the quality of the school, the funding of the school,</p>
<p>the quality of the teachers, their education,</p>
<p>you put all the teacher and school variables together,</p>
<p>it barely accounted for 10% of the variance.</p>
<p>And this has been replicated now.</p>
<p>So the best research we have shows that school variables</p>
<p>and teacher variables together account</p>
<p>for about 10% of student academic achievement.</p>
<p>Now, you wanna have some policy</p>
<p>on improving academic achievement,</p>
<p>how much money do you wanna put into teacher education?</p>
<p>How much money do you wanna put into the quality</p>
<p>of the school administration?</p>
<p>You know who you can ask?</p>
<p>You can ask the Gates Foundation,</p>
<p>because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, because they&rsquo;re measurement people,</p>
<p>they wanna know the data,</p>
<p>they found it had no impact at all.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve kind of pulled out of that kind of program.</p>
<p>So, oh boy.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, this is me talking, but there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Just the two of us.</p>
<p>Just the two of us, but I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>some funny and ridiculous things,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re surely not approving of it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a movie called Clerks.</p>
<p>You probably&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it, I&rsquo;ve seen it, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a funny scene in there where a lovely couple</p>
<p>are talking about the number</p>
<p>of previous sexual partners they had.</p>
<p>And the woman says that,</p>
<p>I believe she just had a handful,</p>
<p>like two or three or something like that sexual partners,</p>
<p>but then she also mentioned that she&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that called?</p>
<p>Fallacia, what&rsquo;s the scientific?</p>
<p>But she went, you know, gave a blow job</p>
<p>to 37 guys, I believe it is.</p>
<p>And so that has to do with the truth.</p>
<p>So sometimes, knowing the truth</p>
<p>can get in the way of a successful relationship</p>
<p>of love of some of the human flourishing.</p>
<p>And that seems to me that&rsquo;s at the core here,</p>
<p>that facing some kind of truth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not able to be changed</p>
<p>makes it difficult to sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Is limiting as opposed to empowering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the concern.</p>
<p>If you sort of test for intelligence</p>
<p>and lay the data out,</p>
<p>it feels like you will give up on certain people.</p>
<p>You will sort of start bidding people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, this person is like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s focus on the average people</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s focus on the very intelligent people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the concern.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a kind of intuition</p>
<p>that if we just don&rsquo;t measure</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t use that data,</p>
<p>that we will treat everybody equal</p>
<p>and give everybody equal opportunity.</p>
<p>If we have the data in front of us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re likely to misdistribute</p>
<p>the amount of sort of attention we allocate,</p>
<p>resources we allocate to people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the concern.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a realistic concern,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a misplaced concern</p>
<p>if you wanna fix the problem.</p>
<p>If you wanna fix the problem,</p>
<p>you have to know what the problem is.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to the bell curve,</p>
<p>not the bell curve, but the normal distribution.</p>
<p>Yes, 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,</p>
<p>which means they&rsquo;re very hard.</p>
<p>If you have an IQ under 85,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to find gainful employment</p>
<p>at a salary that sustains you</p>
<p>at least minimally in modern life, okay?</p>
<p>Not impossible, but it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>16% of the population of the United States</p>
<p>is about 51 or 52 million people with IQs under 85.</p>
<p>This is not a small issue.</p>
<p>14 million children have IQs under 85.</p>
<p>Is this something we wanna ignore?</p>
<p>Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,</p>
<p>you know, when you have people with IQs under 85,</p>
<p>and you have achievement in school or achievement in life?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap there.</p>
<p>This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,</p>
<p>if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end,</p>
<p>that would have a big impact.</p>
<p>If I could maybe, before we talk about the impact on life</p>
<p>and so on, some of the criticisms of the bell curve.</p>
<p>So Steven Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve</p>
<p>rests on four incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>It would be just interesting to get your thoughts</p>
<p>on the four assumptions, which are,</p>
<p>intelligence must be reducible to a single number,</p>
<p>intelligence must be capable of rank ordering people</p>
<p>in a linear order,</p>
<p>intelligence must be primarily genetically based,</p>
<p>and intelligence must be essentially immutable.</p>
<p>Maybe not as criticisms, but as thoughts about intelligence.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.</p>
<p>On Steven Jay Gould?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He wrote that in what, about 1985, 1984?</p>
<p>His views were overtly political, not scientific.</p>
<p>He was a scientist,</p>
<p>but his views on this were overtly political,</p>
<p>and I would encourage people listening to this,</p>
<p>if they really want to understand his criticisms,</p>
<p>they should just Google what he had to say,</p>
<p>and Google the scientific reviews of his book,</p>
<p>The Mismeasure of Man,</p>
<p>and they will take these statements apart.</p>
<p>They were wrong, not only were they wrong,</p>
<p>but when he asserted in his first book</p>
<p>that there was no biological basis essentially to IQ,</p>
<p>by the time the second edition came around,</p>
<p>there were studies of MRIs showing that brain size,</p>
<p>brain volume were correlated to IQ scores,</p>
<p>which he declined to put in his book.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning a lot today.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know actually the extent of his work.</p>
<p>I was just using a few little snippets of criticism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There was a battle here.</p>
<p>He wrote a book, Mismeasure of Man,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s missing a lot of the scientific grounding.</p>
<p>His book is highly popular in colleges today.</p>
<p>You can find it in any college bookstore</p>
<p>under assigned reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly popular.</p>
<p>The Mismeasure of Man?</p>
<p>Yes, highly influential.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m undereducated about this.</p>
<p>So is this the book basically criticizing the ideas in the book?</p>
<p>Yeah, where those four things came from.</p>
<p>And it is really a book that was really taken apart point by point</p>
<p>by a number of people who actually understood the data.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t modify anything.</p>
<p>Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic,</p>
<p>like I said, I believe the impact of the work,</p>
<p>because it is misinterpreted, has to be considered.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just going to be scientific discourse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be political discourse,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be debates,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be politically motivated people</p>
<p>that will use messages in each direction,</p>
<p>make something like the bulk of the enemy</p>
<p>or the support for one&rsquo;s racist beliefs.</p>
<p>And so I think you have to consider that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler</p>
<p>to justify a lot of his beliefs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler</p>
<p>or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil.</p>
<p>But there is a balance there.</p>
<p>So I understand.</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling</p>
<p>or interesting or challenging to you from a scientific perspective?</p>
<p>There were factual criticisms about the nature of the statistics</p>
<p>that were used, the statistical analyses.</p>
<p>These are more technical criticisms.</p>
<p>And they were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles</p>
<p>where he took all the criticisms and spoke to them.</p>
<p>And people listening to this podcast</p>
<p>can certainly find all those online.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Murray went on to write some additional books,</p>
<p>two in the last couple of years, one about human diversity</p>
<p>where he goes through the data refuting the idea that race</p>
<p>is only a social construct with no biological meaning.</p>
<p>He discusses the data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good discussion.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to agree with it.</p>
<p>But he presents data in a cogent way.</p>
<p>And he talks about the critics of that.</p>
<p>And he talks about their data in a cogent, nonpersonal way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very informative discussion.</p>
<p>The book is called Human Diversity.</p>
<p>He talks about race.</p>
<p>And he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.</p>
<p>And more recently, he&rsquo;s written what</p>
<p>might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality</p>
<p>where he talks about this again.</p>
<p>So he can certainly defend himself.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need me to do that.</p>
<p>But I would urge people who have heard</p>
<p>about him and the bell curve and who</p>
<p>think they know what&rsquo;s in it, you are likely incorrect.</p>
<p>And you need to read it for yourself.</p>
<p>But it is, scientifically, it&rsquo;s a serious subject.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult subject.</p>
<p>Ethically, it&rsquo;s a difficult subject.</p>
<p>Everything you said here, calmly and thoughtfully,</p>
<p>is difficult. It&rsquo;s difficult for me</p>
<p>to even consider that G factor exists.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean from like that somehow G factor is inherently</p>
<p>racist or sexist or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s difficult in the way</p>
<p>that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult.</p>
<p>That we are limited by our biology is difficult.</p>
<p>And at least from an American perspective,</p>
<p>you would like to believe that everything</p>
<p>is possible in this world.</p>
<p>Well, that leads us to what I think</p>
<p>we should do with this information.</p>
<p>And what I think we should do with this information</p>
<p>is unusual.</p>
<p>Because I think what we need to do</p>
<p>is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular</p>
<p>biology of learning and memory.</p>
<p>Because one definition of intelligence</p>
<p>is based on how much you can learn</p>
<p>and how much you can remember.</p>
<p>And if you accept that definition of intelligence,</p>
<p>then there are molecular studies going on now,</p>
<p>and Nobel Prizes being won on molecular biology</p>
<p>or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.</p>
<p>Now, the step those researchers, those scientists</p>
<p>need to take when it comes to intelligence</p>
<p>is to focus on the concept of individual differences.</p>
<p>Intelligence research has individual differences</p>
<p>as its heart because it assumes that people</p>
<p>differ on this variable.</p>
<p>And those differences are meaningful</p>
<p>and need understanding.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychologists who have morphed</p>
<p>into molecular biologists studying learning and memory</p>
<p>hate the concept of individual differences historically.</p>
<p>Some now are coming around to it.</p>
<p>I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner</p>
<p>for his work on memory.</p>
<p>And I asked him about individual differences.</p>
<p>And he said, don&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll set us back 50 years.</p>
<p>But I said, don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the key, though, to understand?</p>
<p>Why can some people remember more than others?</p>
<p>He said, you don&rsquo;t want to go there.</p>
<p>I think the 21st century will be remembered</p>
<p>by the technology and the science that</p>
<p>goes to individual differences.</p>
<p>Because we have now data.</p>
<p>We have now the tools to much, much better</p>
<p>to start to measure, start to estimate,</p>
<p>not just on the sort of through tests and IQ test type</p>
<p>of things, sort of outside the body kind of things,</p>
<p>but measuring all kinds of stuff about the body.</p>
<p>So yeah, truly go into the molecular biology,</p>
<p>to the neurobiology, to the neuroscience.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about life.</p>
<p>How does intelligence correlate with or lead to</p>
<p>or has anything to do with career success?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And is there any data?</p>
<p>You had an excellent conversation</p>
<p>with Jordan Peterson, for example.</p>
<p>Is there any data on what intelligent</p>
<p>means for success in life?</p>
<p>Success in life.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous amount of validity data</p>
<p>that looked at intelligence test scores and various measures</p>
<p>of life success.</p>
<p>Now, of course, life success is a pretty broad topic.</p>
<p>And not everybody agrees on what success means.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s general agreement on certain aspects of success</p>
<p>that can be measured.</p>
<p>Including life expectancy, like you said.</p>
<p>Life expectancy.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s life success.</p>
<p>Life expectancy, I mean, that is such an interesting finding.</p>
<p>But IQ scores are also correlated to things like income.</p>
<p>Now, OK, so who thinks income means you&rsquo;re successful?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that income is one empirical measure</p>
<p>in this culture that says something</p>
<p>about your level of success.</p>
<p>You can define success in ways that</p>
<p>have nothing to do with income.</p>
<p>You can define success based on your evolutionary natural</p>
<p>selection success.</p>
<p>But for variables, and even that, by the way,</p>
<p>is correlated to IQ in some studies.</p>
<p>So however you want to define success, IQ is important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only determinant.</p>
<p>People get hung up on, well, what about personality?</p>
<p>What about so called emotional intelligence?</p>
<p>Yes, all those things matter.</p>
<p>The thing that matters empirically,</p>
<p>the single thing that matters the most</p>
<p>is your general ability, your general mental intellectual</p>
<p>ability, your reasoning ability.</p>
<p>And the more complex your vocation,</p>
<p>the more complex your job, the more G matters.</p>
<p>G doesn&rsquo;t matter in a lot of occupations</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t require complex thinking.</p>
<p>And there are occupations like that, and G doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Within an occupation, the G might not matter so much.</p>
<p>So that if you look at all the professors at MIT</p>
<p>and had a way to rank order them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ceiling effect is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>That, you know.</p>
<p>Also, when you get past a certain threshold,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s impact on wealth, for example,</p>
<p>or career success, however that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defined in each individual discipline.</p>
<p>But after a certain point, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Actually, it does matter in certain things.</p>
<p>So for example, there is a very classic study</p>
<p>that was started at Johns Hopkins when</p>
<p>I was a graduate student there.</p>
<p>And I actually worked on this study at the very beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the study of mathematically and scientifically</p>
<p>precocious youth.</p>
<p>And they gave junior high school students</p>
<p>age 11 and 12 the standard SAT math exam.</p>
<p>And they found a very large number of students</p>
<p>scored very high on this exam.</p>
<p>Not a large number.</p>
<p>I mean, they found many students when</p>
<p>they cast the net to all of Baltimore.</p>
<p>They found a number of students who</p>
<p>scored as high on the SAT math when</p>
<p>they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen.</p>
<p>And they said, gee, now this is interesting.</p>
<p>What shall we do now?</p>
<p>And on a case by case basis, they</p>
<p>got some of those kids into their local community college</p>
<p>math programs.</p>
<p>Many of those kids went on to be very successful.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s a 50 year follow up of those kids.</p>
<p>And it turns out these kids were in the top 1%.</p>
<p>So everybody in this study is in the top 1%.</p>
<p>If you take that group, that rarefied group,</p>
<p>and divide them into quartiles so that you have the top 25%</p>
<p>of the top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%,</p>
<p>you can find unmeasurable variables of success.</p>
<p>The top quartile does better than the bottom quartile</p>
<p>in the top 1%.</p>
<p>They have more patents.</p>
<p>They have more publications.</p>
<p>They have more tenure at universities.</p>
<p>And this is based on, you&rsquo;re dividing them</p>
<p>based on their score at age 12.</p>
<p>I wonder how much interesting data</p>
<p>is in the variability in the differences.</p>
<p>So but that&rsquo;s really, oh, boy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, I don&rsquo;t know, somehow painful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s so painful that that G</p>
<p>factor is so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.</p>
<p>This is interesting that you find that painful.</p>
<p>Do you find it painful that people with charisma</p>
<p>are very successful, can be very successful in life,</p>
<p>even though having no other attributes other than they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>famous and people like them?</p>
<p>Do you find that painful?</p>
<p>Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.</p>
<p>So one of the things, again, this</p>
<p>is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial.</p>
<p>But one of the things the psychologist, the personality</p>
<p>psychologist, he can maybe speak to this</p>
<p>because he had an interest in this for a time,</p>
<p>is she was saying that personality, technically</p>
<p>speaking, is the thing that doesn&rsquo;t change over a lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know if she was actually</p>
<p>implying that you&rsquo;re born with it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a trait.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trait that&rsquo;s state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trait that&rsquo;s relatively stable over time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s generally correct.</p>
<p>So to the degree your personality</p>
<p>is stable over time, yes, that too is painful.</p>
<p>Because what&rsquo;s not painful is the thing,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m fat and out of shape, I can</p>
<p>exercise and become healthier in that way.</p>
<p>If my diet is a giant mess and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>resulting in some kind of conditions</p>
<p>that my body is experiencing, I can fix that</p>
<p>by having a better diet.</p>
<p>That sort of my actions, my willed actions</p>
<p>can make a change.</p>
<p>If charisma is part of the personality that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that</p>
<p>is stable, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s painful too.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, oh shit, I&rsquo;m stuck with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stuck with this.</p>
<p>Well, and this pretty much generalizes</p>
<p>to every aspect of your being.</p>
<p>This is who you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to deal with it.</p>
<p>And what it undermines, of course,</p>
<p>is a realistic appreciation for this,</p>
<p>undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country</p>
<p>that if you work hard, you can be anything you want to be,</p>
<p>which has morphed from the original idea</p>
<p>that if you work hard, you can be successful.</p>
<p>Those are two different things.</p>
<p>And now we have if you work hard,</p>
<p>you can be anything you want to be.</p>
<p>This is completely unrealistic.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>Now, you can work hard and be successful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>I could work very hard, and I am not</p>
<p>going to be a successful theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not.</p>
<p>That said, I mean, we should, because we</p>
<p>had this conversation already, but it&rsquo;s good to repeat.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>a theoretical physicist is not judgment</p>
<p>on your basic humanity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re turning again to the all men, which means</p>
<p>men and women are created equal.</p>
<p>So again, some of the differences</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about in quote unquote success, wealth,</p>
<p>number of whether you win a Nobel Prize or not,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t put a measure on your basic humanity</p>
<p>and basic value and even goodness of you</p>
<p>as a human being.</p>
<p>Because your basic role and value in society</p>
<p>is largely within your control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some of these measures that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to remember this.</p>
<p>One question about the Flynn effect.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Are humans getting smarter over the years, over the decades,</p>
<p>over the centuries?</p>
<p>The Flynn effect is James Flynn, who passed away about a year</p>
<p>ago, published a set of analyses going back</p>
<p>a couple of decades when he first noticed this,</p>
<p>that IQ scores, when you looked over the years,</p>
<p>seemed to be drifting up.</p>
<p>Now, this was not unknown to the people who make the test</p>
<p>because they renorm the test periodically</p>
<p>and they have to renorm the test periodically</p>
<p>because what 10 items correct meant</p>
<p>relative to other people 50 years ago</p>
<p>is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today.</p>
<p>People are getting more things correct.</p>
<p>Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points.</p>
<p>IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade.</p>
<p>This is not a personal effect.</p>
<p>This is a cohort effect.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not for an individual, but.</p>
<p>The world, how do you explain?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>And this has presented intelligence researchers</p>
<p>with a great mystery.</p>
<p>Two questions.</p>
<p>First, is it effect on the 50% of the variance that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the G factor or on the other 50%?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s evidence that it is a G factor effect.</p>
<p>And second, what on earth causes this?</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t this mean intelligence and G factor</p>
<p>cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection</p>
<p>is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been used to try to undermine the idea</p>
<p>that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence.</p>
<p>But certainly, it can be the Flynn effect</p>
<p>can affect the nongenetic aspects of intelligence</p>
<p>because genes account for maybe 50% of the variance.</p>
<p>Maybe higher, could be as high as 80% for adults,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say 50% for discussion.</p>
<p>So the Flynn effect, it&rsquo;s still a mystery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a mystery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out.</p>
<p>I told you before I edited a journal on intelligence,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m starting to see papers now on really</p>
<p>the latest research on this.</p>
<p>I think most people who specialize</p>
<p>in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect</p>
<p>are coming to the view based on data</p>
<p>that it has to do with advances in nutrition and health care.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also evidence that the effect is slowing down</p>
<p>and possibly reversing.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>So how would nutrition and health,</p>
<p>so nutrition would still be connected to the G factor.</p>
<p>So nutrition as it relates to the G factor,</p>
<p>so the biology that leads to the intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That would be the claim.</p>
<p>Like the hypothesis being tested by the research.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence from infants</p>
<p>that nutrition has made a difference.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable connection.</p>
<p>But does it negate the idea that there&rsquo;s a genetic influence?</p>
<p>Not logically at all.</p>
<p>But it is very interesting.</p>
<p>So that if you take an IQ test today but you take the score</p>
<p>and use the tables that were available in 1940,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to wind up with a much higher IQ number.</p>
<p>So are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago?</p>
<p>No, but we might be able to solve problems a little better.</p>
<p>And make use of our G because of things like Sesame Street</p>
<p>and other curricula in school.</p>
<p>More people are going to school.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of factors here to disentangle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that there&rsquo;s not clear answers yet.</p>
<p>That as a population, we&rsquo;re getting smarter.</p>
<p>When you just zoom out, that&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>As a population, we&rsquo;re getting smarter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to see what the effects of that are.</p>
<p>I mean, this raises the question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned it many times but haven&rsquo;t clearly addressed it,</p>
<p>which is nature versus nurture question.</p>
<p>So how much of intelligence is nature?</p>
<p>How much of it is nurture?</p>
<p>How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>All of it is genetics.</p>
<p>No, all of it is nature and nurture.</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?</p>
<p>Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question</p>
<p>is framed that way, it can&rsquo;t be answered because nature and nurture are not two independent</p>
<p>influences.</p>
<p>They interact with each other.</p>
<p>And understanding those interactions is so complex that many behavioral geneticists say</p>
<p>it is today impossible and always will be impossible to disentangle that, no matter</p>
<p>what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic informatics.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still, to push back on that, that same intuition from behavioral geneticists</p>
<p>would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super complex.</p>
<p>Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome.</p>
<p>But because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just</p>
<p>one study, but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that</p>
<p>whatever interactions between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be</p>
<p>studied, and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;ll do this exact question because doesn&rsquo;t the stability of the G factor give</p>
<p>you at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?</p>
<p>Yes, I think it&rsquo;s clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness</p>
<p>of your cortex, that it&rsquo;s correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain, that identical</p>
<p>twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores.</p>
<p>These are all important observations that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a biological basis.</p>
<p>And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so obvious.</p>
<p>Well indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is environment interacting</p>
<p>with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?</p>
<p>Well some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception</p>
<p>through adulthood, or at least through the childhood, that that so called hardware that</p>
<p>you are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think,</p>
<p>but it is probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment</p>
<p>and other factors like that, including chance.</p>
<p>That chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during gestation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, hey, it&rsquo;s pre programmed.</p>
<p>So there is push back on the concept that genes provide a blueprint, that it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>more fluid.</p>
<p>Well, but also, yeah, so there&rsquo;s a lot, a lot, a lot happens in the first few months</p>
<p>of development.</p>
<p>So in nine months inside the mother&rsquo;s body and in the few months afterwards, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of fascinating stuff, like including chance and luck, like you said, how things</p>
<p>connect up.</p>
<p>The question is afterwards in your plasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is</p>
<p>relative to the environment, how much that affects the G factor, but that&rsquo;s where the</p>
<p>whole conclusions of the studies that we&rsquo;ve been talking about is that seems to have less</p>
<p>and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.</p>
<p>As yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, by my view, and I&rsquo;m not an expert</p>
<p>on this, I mean, genetics is a highly technical and complex subject.</p>
<p>I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation</p>
<p>of this is that there is a genetic blueprint, more or less, and that has a profound influence</p>
<p>on your subsequent intellectual development, including the G factor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say things can&rsquo;t happen to, I mean, if you think of that genes provide</p>
<p>a potential, fine, and then various variables impact that potential, and every parent of</p>
<p>a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.</p>
<p>This is why you buy educational toys.</p>
<p>This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.</p>
<p>This is why you do all these things, because you want your baby to be as healthy and as</p>
<p>smart as possible, and every parent will say that.</p>
<p>Is there a case to be made, can you steel man the case, that genetics is a very tiny</p>
<p>component of all of this, and the environment is essential?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component.</p>
<p>I think the data support the idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say component, I say influence, a very important influence, and the environment is a lot less</p>
<p>than people believe.</p>
<p>Most people believe environment plays a big role.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m asking you is, can you see where what you just said, it might be wrong?</p>
<p>Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say, you</p>
<p>know what, the intuition, the studies so far, like reversing the directions.</p>
<p>So one of the cool things we have now more and more is we&rsquo;re getting more and more data,</p>
<p>and the rate of the data is escalating because of the digital world.</p>
<p>So when you start to look at a very large scale of data, both on the biology side and</p>
<p>the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive things about society.</p>
<p>We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge cases and</p>
<p>they become like the norm, that we&rsquo;ll have a complete shift in our, like you&rsquo;ll see G</p>
<p>factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens and in later life.</p>
<p>So is it any case you can make or for where your current intuitions are wrong?</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s a good question because I think everyone should always be asked what evidence</p>
<p>would change your mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working</p>
<p>on any aspect of science.</p>
<p>I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by now.</p>
<p>It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early childhood education,</p>
<p>all these things that have been earnestly tried in well funded, well designed studies</p>
<p>would show some effect, and they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What if the school, the way we&rsquo;ve tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do</p>
<p>better?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everybody said at the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everybody said to Jensen.</p>
<p>He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier.</p>
<p>Maybe we need not do prekindergarten, but pre, prekindergarten.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always an infinite, well, maybe we didn&rsquo;t get it right.</p>
<p>But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would</p>
<p>have worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level</p>
<p>at 0.05 on some means.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I, that&rsquo;s the kind of evidence that would change my mind.</p>
<p>Population level interventions like schooling that you would see like this actually has</p>
<p>an effect.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And when you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when</p>
<p>those adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don&rsquo;t correlate with the IQ scores of their</p>
<p>adoptive parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents</p>
<p>whom they&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>I mean, these are important, these are powerful observations.</p>
<p>And it would be convincing to you if the reverse was true.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That would be more.</p>
<p>And there is some data on adoption that indicates that the adopted children are moving a little</p>
<p>bit more toward their adoptive parents.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s to me the overwhelming, I have this concept called the weight of evidence where</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t interpret any one study too much.</p>
<p>The weight of evidence tells me genes are important.</p>
<p>But what does that mean?</p>
<p>What does it mean that genes are important?</p>
<p>Knowing that gene expression, genes don&rsquo;t express themselves in a vacuum, they express</p>
<p>themselves in an environment.</p>
<p>So the environment has to have something to do with it, especially if the best genetic</p>
<p>estimates of the amount of variants are around 50 or even if it&rsquo;s as high as 80%, it still</p>
<p>leaves 20% of non genetic.</p>
<p>Now maybe that is all luck.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s all chance.</p>
<p>I could believe that, I could easily believe that.</p>
<p>But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions and nothing works, including</p>
<p>memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing computer games, none of</p>
<p>that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.</p>
<p>Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?</p>
<p>Yes, and there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents IQ and</p>
<p>the environment.</p>
<p>High IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition</p>
<p>to the genes, it&rsquo;s that environment.</p>
<p>So there are all these interactions that, think about the number of books in a household.</p>
<p>This was a variable that&rsquo;s correlated with IQ and, well, why?</p>
<p>Especially if the kid never reads any of the books, it&rsquo;s because more intelligent people</p>
<p>have more books in their house.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re more intelligent and there&rsquo;s a genetic component to that, the child will</p>
<p>get those genes or some of those genes as well as the environment.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child.</p>
<p>So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to get rid of the</p>
<p>SAT test, oh, the SAT score is highly correlated with the social economic status of the parents.</p>
<p>So all you&rsquo;re really measuring is how rich the parents are.</p>
<p>Okay, well, why are the parents rich?</p>
<p>And so the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright make more money,</p>
<p>they can afford homes in better neighborhoods so their kids get better schools.</p>
<p>Now the kids grow up bright.</p>
<p>Where in that chain of events does that come from?</p>
<p>Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design where you look at siblings</p>
<p>that have the same biological parents and so on, you can&rsquo;t really disentangle all that.</p>
<p>Most studies of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed</p>
<p>design.</p>
<p>So any conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause</p>
<p>of the IQ is a stretch.</p>
<p>And where you do find genetically informative designs, you find most of the variance in</p>
<p>your outcome measures are due to the genetic component.</p>
<p>And sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn&rsquo;t add very</p>
<p>much variance to predict what&rsquo;s going on beyond the genetic variance.</p>
<p>So when you actually look at it in some, and there aren&rsquo;t that many studies that have genetically</p>
<p>informed designs, but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.</p>
<p>Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between fertility or the number</p>
<p>of kids that you have and G factor?</p>
<p>So you know, the kind of conventional wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status</p>
<p>or something like that are having fewer children.</p>
<p>I just loosely hear these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is there data that you&rsquo;re aware of in one direction or another on this?</p>
<p>Strange questions always get strange answers.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?</p>
<p>The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family, the</p>
<p>firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that those studies hold up over time.</p>
<p>And of course what you see also is that families where there are multiple children, four, five,</p>
<p>six, seven, you know, really big families, the social economic status of those families</p>
<p>usually in the modern age is not that high.</p>
<p>Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly.</p>
<p>But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility, but I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s some data to that, but I&rsquo;m not current on that.</p>
<p>How would that be explained?</p>
<p>That would be in a nurture.</p>
<p>Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment, I mean, and this is why</p>
<p>this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that there are a lot of gray</p>
<p>areas and no definitive answers.</p>
<p>This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions</p>
<p>you get, not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated.</p>
<p>And the idea that we have people on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the</p>
<p>Big Bang, that&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, we</p>
<p>can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear to me.</p>
<p>I think we overemphasize.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very humbling statement.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a very human centric, egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super complicated,</p>
<p>but biology is a tricky one to unravel.</p>
<p>Consciousness, what is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real fundamental</p>
<p>problems of the human brain, and therefore I think they must be related.</p>
<p>Yeah, heart problems like walk together, holding hands kind of idea.</p>
<p>You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain</p>
<p>imaging trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off</p>
<p>when someone loses consciousness?</p>
<p>And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained?</p>
<p>And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire, who was really brilliant</p>
<p>at this.</p>
<p>These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography</p>
<p>long before fMRI.</p>
<p>And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain, and the harder the brain</p>
<p>was working, the more sugar it would take up, and then you could make a picture of glucose</p>
<p>use in the brain.</p>
<p>And he was amazing.</p>
<p>He managed to do this in normal volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they</p>
<p>were going into surgery.</p>
<p>He managed all the human subjects requirements on this research, and he was brilliant at</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>And what we did is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions.</p>
<p>On one occasion, he gave them enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy.</p>
<p>And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anesthetized them.</p>
<p>And he would say, Mike, can you hear me, and the person would say, uh, yeah.</p>
<p>And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition.</p>
<p>So same person.</p>
<p>And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off.</p>
<p>He subsequently tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution, and you</p>
<p>could do it in real time as the person went under and then regain consciousness where</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t do that with PET.</p>
<p>You had to have three different occasions.</p>
<p>And the results were absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>We did this with different anesthetic drugs, and different drugs impacted different parts</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>So we were naturally looking for the common one, and it seemed to have something to do</p>
<p>with the thalamus.</p>
<p>And consciousness, this was actual data on consciousness, actual consciousness.</p>
<p>What part of the brain turns on?</p>
<p>What part of the brain turns off?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so clear.</p>
<p>But maybe has something to do with the thalamus.</p>
<p>The sequence of events seemed to have the thalamus in it.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Are some people more conscious than others?</p>
<p>Are there individual differences in consciousness?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean it in the psychedelic sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean it in the political consciousness sense.</p>
<p>I just mean it in everyday life.</p>
<p>Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others?</p>
<p>And are those the people we might actually label more intelligent?</p>
<p>Now the other thing I was looking for is whether the parts of the brain we were seeing in the</p>
<p>anesthesia studies were the same parts of the brain we were seeing in the intelligence</p>
<p>studies.</p>
<p>Now, this was very complicated, expensive research.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really have funding to do this.</p>
<p>We were trying to do it on the fly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anybody has pursued this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m retired now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone on to other things.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts, a lot</p>
<p>more imaging studies now of consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not up on them.</p>
<p>But basically the question is which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution,</p>
<p>spatial and temporal way, which part of the brain lights up when you&rsquo;re doing intelligence</p>
<p>tasks and which parts of the brain lights up when you&rsquo;re doing consciousness tasks and</p>
<p>see the interplay between them, try to infer, that&rsquo;s the challenge of neuroscience, without</p>
<p>understanding deeply, looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole</p>
<p>thing works.</p>
<p>Well, imagine this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple question.</p>
<p>Does it take more anesthetic drug to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is</p>
<p>140 than a person with an IQ of 70?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting way to study it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if the answer to that is a stable yes, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>So I tried to find out and I went to some anesthesiology textbooks about how you dose</p>
<p>and they dose by weight.</p>
<p>And what I also learned, this is a little bit off subject, anesthesiologists are never</p>
<p>sure how deep you are.</p>
<p>And they usually tell by poking you with a needle and if you don&rsquo;t jump, they tell the</p>
<p>surgeon to go ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s literally true, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are.</p>
<p>It has to do with the same kind of measurements that you were doing with the consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t lose my train of thought.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find in the textbooks anything about dosing by intelligence.</p>
<p>I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I said, can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as</p>
<p>a proxy for IQ?</p>
<p>Because if someone&rsquo;s gone to graduate school, that tells you something.</p>
<p>You can make some inference as opposed to someone who didn&rsquo;t graduate high school.</p>
<p>Can we do a chart review?</p>
<p>And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose.</p>
<p>And no, he said, no.</p>
<p>So to this day, the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone</p>
<p>under if they have a high IQ or less, or less?</p>
<p>It could go either way.</p>
<p>Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of intelligence found the unexpected result</p>
<p>of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t how much a brain area lit up.</p>
<p>How much it lit up was negatively correlated to how well they did on the test, which led</p>
<p>to the brain efficiency hypothesis, which is still being studied today.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain information processing</p>
<p>is more related to intelligence than just more activity.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;ll be interesting, again, this is the total hypothesis, how much in the relationship</p>
<p>between intelligence and consciousness, it&rsquo;s not obvious that those two, if there&rsquo;s correlation,</p>
<p>they could be inversely correlated.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be funny?</p>
<p>If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor plus the G factor equals one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice trade off, you get a trade off, how deeply you experience the world versus</p>
<p>how deeply you&rsquo;re able to reason through the world.</p>
<p>What a great hypothesis.</p>
<p>Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from</p>
<p>an AI perspective, I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve thought about machines, but there&rsquo;s the famous</p>
<p>Turing test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation</p>
<p>of intelligence that Alan Turing proposed.</p>
<p>Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to think that a machine is a human</p>
<p>that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing for humans.</p>
<p>If I can fool you that I&rsquo;m intelligent, then that&rsquo;s a good test of intelligence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting test, because maybe charisma can be very useful there, and you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.</p>
<p>Anyway, all that to say is what are good tests of intelligence for machines?</p>
<p>What do you think it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?</p>
<p>I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly</p>
<p>reach the limits of my knowledge and imagination.</p>
<p>When Alexa first came out, and I think there was a competing one, well, there was Siri</p>
<p>with Apple, and Google had Alexa.</p>
<p>No, no, Amazon had Alexa.</p>
<p>Amazon had Alexa.</p>
<p>Google has Google Home.</p>
<p>Google has something.</p>
<p>I proposed to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each, and then ask</p>
<p>it questions from the IQ test.</p>
<p>But it became apparent that they all searched the internet, so they all can find answers</p>
<p>to questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you said to Alexa, I&rsquo;m going to repeat these numbers backwards to</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done it.</p>
<p>So one answer to your question is you&rsquo;re going to try it right now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Yes, Siri.</p>
<p>So it would actually probably go to Google search, and it will be all confusing kind</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>It would fail.</p>
<p>Well, then I guess there was a test that it would fail.</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s not, that has to do more with the language of communication versus</p>
<p>the content.</p>
<p>So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn&rsquo;t speak English, and the test was administered</p>
<p>in English, that&rsquo;s not really the test of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that, because I happen to know how those are programmed, those are very hard</p>
<p>coded, and there&rsquo;s definitely a lack of intelligence there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like IQ tests, there&rsquo;s a guy, an artificial intelligence researcher,</p>
<p>Francois Chollet, he&rsquo;s at Google, he&rsquo;s one of the seminal people in machine learning.</p>
<p>He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.</p>
<p>Oh, I haven&rsquo;t heard that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just like to know about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually email you this, because it&rsquo;d be very interesting for you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get much attention, because people don&rsquo;t know what to do with it, but it deserves</p>
<p>a lot of attention, which is, it basically does a pattern type of tests, where you have</p>
<p>to do, you know, one standard one is, you&rsquo;re given three things, and you have to do a fourth</p>
<p>one, that kind of thing, so you have to understand the pattern here.</p>
<p>And for that, it really simplifies to, so the interesting thing is, he&rsquo;s trying not</p>
<p>to achieve high IQ, he&rsquo;s trying to achieve like, pretty low bar for IQ.</p>
<p>Things that are kind of trivial for humans, and they&rsquo;re actually really tough for machines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just seeing, playing with these concepts of symmetry, of counting, like if I give you</p>
<p>one object, two objects, three objects, you&rsquo;ll know the last one is four objects, you can</p>
<p>like count them, you can cluster objects together, it&rsquo;s both visually and conceptually, we can</p>
<p>do all these things with our mind, that we take for granted, the objectness of things.</p>
<p>You can like, figure out what spatially is an object and isn&rsquo;t, and we can play with</p>
<p>those ideas, and machines really struggle with that, so he really cleanly formulated</p>
<p>these IQ tests, I wonder what like, that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>a very low IQ, but that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of formulation, like okay, we want to be able</p>
<p>to solve this, how do we solve this, and he does it as a challenge, and nobody&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>able to, it&rsquo;s similar to the Alexa prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational</p>
<p>challenge, nobody&rsquo;s been able to do well on his, but that&rsquo;s an interesting, those kinds</p>
<p>of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all the ability of the human mind</p>
<p>to play with concepts, and to formulate concepts out of novel things, so like, things we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen before, we&rsquo;re able to use that, I mean that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve talked to a few people</p>
<p>that design IQ tests, sort of online, they write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some</p>
<p>questions from them, and they spoke to the fact that we can&rsquo;t really share questions</p>
<p>with you, because part of the, like first of all, it&rsquo;s really hard work to come up with</p>
<p>questions, it&rsquo;s really, really hard work, it takes a lot of research, but it also takes</p>
<p>a lot, it&rsquo;s novelty generating, you&rsquo;re constantly coming up with really new things, and part</p>
<p>of the point is that they&rsquo;re not supposed to be public, they&rsquo;re supposed to be new</p>
<p>to you when you look at them, it&rsquo;s interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness</p>
<p>of the problem, at least a part of what makes the problem hard is that you&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>it before.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what&rsquo;s called crystallized intelligence,</p>
<p>which is your knowledge of facts, you know things, but can you use those things to solve</p>
<p>a problem, those are two different things.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to, because we spoke, I don&rsquo;t want to miss opportunity to</p>
<p>talk about this, we spoke about the neurobiology, about the molecular biology of intelligence,</p>
<p>do you think one day we&rsquo;ll be able to modify the biology of, or the genetics of a person</p>
<p>to modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence, we started this conversation</p>
<p>by talking about a pill you could take, do you think that such a pill would exist?</p>
<p>Metaphorically, I do, and I am supremely confident that it&rsquo;s possible because I am supremely</p>
<p>ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology, and so I have written that the nightmares</p>
<p>of neurobiologists, understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the</p>
<p>synaptic level, that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve.</p>
<p>So some people, you have to be undaunted, I mean yeah, this is not easy, look we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still trying to figure out cancer, it was only recently that they figured out why aspirin</p>
<p>works, you know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history</p>
<p>of science, is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.</p>
<p>And seem impossible at the time.</p>
<p>And so one of the things you look at, at companies like Neuralink, you have brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines measuring but</p>
<p>also sending signals to the human mind, and you start to wonder what that has, what impact</p>
<p>that has on the G factor.</p>
<p>Modifying in small ways or in large ways the functioning, the mechanical, electrical, chemical</p>
<p>functioning of the brain.</p>
<p>I look at everything about the brain, there are different levels of explanation.</p>
<p>On one hand you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry, and then you</p>
<p>have neurons, and then you have dendrites, and then you have synapses, and then you have</p>
<p>the neurotransmitters, and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals, and then you</p>
<p>have all the things that influence neurotransmitters, and then you have the individual differences</p>
<p>among people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated, but 51 million people in the United States have IQs under 85 and</p>
<p>struggle with everyday life.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that motivate people to take a look at this?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that you have to remember that the science</p>
<p>of intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition.</p>
<p>The thing that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world</p>
<p>is perhaps loosely correlated, but is not dependent entirely on intelligence.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I certainly agree with that.</p>
<p>So for anyone sort of listening, I&rsquo;m still not convinced that more intelligence is always</p>
<p>better if you want to create beauty in this world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t say more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty.</p>
<p>I just said all things being equal, more is better than less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s sort of that I just want to sort of say because a lot to me, one of</p>
<p>the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create beautiful things, and so I just</p>
<p>want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what some IQ test says.</p>
<p>At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people and to also inspire</p>
<p>us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college, whether they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about career or they&rsquo;re thinking about a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give whether they want to pursue psychology or biology or engineering</p>
<p>or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t advise anybody on that level of what their passion is, but I can say if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interested in psychology or if you&rsquo;re interested in science and the science around the big</p>
<p>questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness, we haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from.</p>
<p>If you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, you are trying to develop</p>
<p>a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.</p>
<p>So it could well be that the so called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>trying to develop a drug for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to do, right, yeah, just like you said.</p>
<p>What will that drug do in a college student that doesn&rsquo;t have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease?</p>
<p>So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in science</p>
<p>to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions.</p>
<p>And the most important thing I can tell you if you&rsquo;re going to be in kind of a research</p>
<p>environment is you got to follow the data where the data take you.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t decide in advance where you want the data to go.</p>
<p>And if the data take you to places that you don&rsquo;t have the technical expertise to follow,</p>
<p>like you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to become a molecular biologist now.</p>
<p>But I know people who are, and my job is to get them interested to take their expertise</p>
<p>into this direction.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s not so easy.</p>
<p>And if the data takes you to a place that&rsquo;s controversial, that&rsquo;s counterintuitive in</p>
<p>this world, no, I would say it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to still push forward boldly,</p>
<p>but to communicate the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with</p>
<p>the greater breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science, of the impact of the</p>
<p>results.</p>
<p>One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between</p>
<p>pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people&rsquo;s sensitivities, the</p>
<p>legitimate sensitivities, somehow.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say how.</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>And this is&hellip;</p>
<p>This sense, somehow, and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, you said big questions, the biggest, or one of the biggest, we already</p>
<p>talked about consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about the why.</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re not going to tell me?</p>
<p>This is very&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to wait for your next book.</p>
<p>The meaning of life.</p>
<p>We do the best we can to get through the day.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just a finite number of the days.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of the finiteness of it?</p>
<p>I think about it more and more as I get older.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of these human things, that it is finite, we all know it.</p>
<p>Most of us deny it and don&rsquo;t want to think about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning, you try to do the rational thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited</p>
<p>and you want to get things done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I am on that.</p>
<p>It is just one of those things that&rsquo;s always in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s uncommon.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s just like G factor and intelligence, it&rsquo;s a hard truth that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And sometimes you kind of walk past it and you don&rsquo;t want to look at it, but it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, you can&rsquo;t escape it.</p>
<p>And the thing about the G factor and intelligence is everybody knows this is true on a personal</p>
<p>daily basis.</p>
<p>Even if you think back to when you were in school, you know who the smart kids were.</p>
<p>When you are on the phone talking to a customer service representative, that in response to</p>
<p>your detailed question is reading a script back to you and you get furious at this.</p>
<p>Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person a moron?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not listening to me.</p>
<p>Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people who they think are not at their</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just common because that&rsquo;s the way human beings are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way life is.</p>
<p>But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence.</p>
<p>We have a poor, and we&rsquo;re not always a great, our judgment of human character of other people</p>
<p>is not as good as a battery of tests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where bias comes in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where our history, our emotions, all of that comes in.</p>
<p>So, you know, people on the internet, you know, there&rsquo;s such a thing as the internet</p>
<p>and people on the internet will call each other dumb all the time.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the worry here is that we give up on people.</p>
<p>We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small number of interactions as if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hopeless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just in their genetics.</p>
<p>But I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should</p>
<p>not have compassion for our fellow man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what the science does say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not opposite of what the science says.</p>
<p>Everything I know about psychology, everything I&rsquo;ve learned about intelligence, everything</p>
<p>points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat people as individuals respectfully</p>
<p>and with compassion.</p>
<p>Because through no fault of their own, some people are not as capable as others.</p>
<p>And you want to turn a blind eye to it, you want to come up with theories about why that</p>
<p>might be true, fine.</p>
<p>I would like to fix some of it as best I can.</p>
<p>And everybody is deserving of love.</p>
<p>Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting warmed up here.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know you can go for another many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time,</p>
<p>this is an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you&rsquo;ve given with the New York Science of</p>
<p>Intelligence.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s a difficult topic, it&rsquo;s a topic that&rsquo;s controversial</p>
<p>and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly and in that nuanced way, just thank</p>
<p>you for everything you do.</p>
<p>And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence, of consciousness.</p>
<p>Well thank you for asking me.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing like good conversation on these topics.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Haier.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>It is not that I&rsquo;m so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
