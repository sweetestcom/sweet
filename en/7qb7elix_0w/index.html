<p>change this battery I you know I knew</p>
<p>this was going to happen sooner or later</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s technology but uh you know love it</p>
<p>or hate it</p>
<p>and uh once again so let&rsquo;s see so they</p>
<p>are really digging into this so audience</p>
<p>in this little time we want you to try</p>
<p>to respond as quickly as as possible and</p>
<p>yes let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s go to social media and you can</p>
<p>certainly talk about it so Mr valgaard</p>
<p>from YouTube what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about glutamine glutamine versus</p>
<p>glucosamine or</p>
<p>glutathione did I say that right doc</p>
<p>glutathione and glucosamine</p>
<p>uh yeah hang on let me uh let me get</p>
<p>that again</p>
<p>uh what are your thoughts about</p>
<p>glutamine versus</p>
<p>glucosamine or</p>
<p>glutathione did I say that right there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three of them he&rsquo;s curious about it</p>
<p>three different molecules glutathione is</p>
<p>the major antioxidant for the liver and</p>
<p>uh you need selenium as a byproduct a</p>
<p>lot of people don&rsquo;t have enough of that</p>
<p>so um your body actually can make it uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called endogenously Uh you can take</p>
<p>it as a supplement if you want but it</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s one thing and then you have</p>
<p>glucosamine is good for the joints</p>
<p>especially if you have arthritis things</p>
<p>like that and so then you also said one</p>
<p>more what was the other one Steve okay</p>
<p>the last one was glutathione if I said</p>
<p>that right</p>
<p>glutathione and glutamine and what was</p>
<p>the other one there I think oh and</p>
<p>glucosamine glucosamine sulfate is for</p>
<p>the joints</p>
<p>glutathione is um is good for the liver</p>
<p>that is antioxidant and then</p>
<p>um you have glutamine which is an amino</p>
<p>acid which is a precursor for</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s one of the amino acids that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>precursor for many different types of</p>
<p>proteins in the body and that&rsquo;s one that</p>
<p>cancer can consume as well and so this</p>
<p>is why there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>thing out there called Don which blocks</p>
<p>glutamine and uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the cancer protocol that</p>
<p>sea free talks about</p>
<p>um and I think there&rsquo;s also an inhibitor</p>
<p>of a natural Dawn inhibitor it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>dawn but it&rsquo;s an inhibitor of that you</p>
<p>can have in green tea that has some bit</p>
<p>of a</p>
<p>action of inhibiting that amino acid so</p>
<p>cancer can consume it wonderful well wow</p>
<p>that was a mouthful and thank you Mr</p>
<p>valgaard for that interesting uh</p>
<p>question and I hope that helped you and</p>
<p>audience thank you for being so Johnny</p>
<p>on the spot when we were having a little</p>
<p>technical difficulties and dug into the</p>
<p>first question which asked what is the</p>
<p>most common mineral deficiency in the</p>
<p>world and our audience sixty percent of</p>
<p>them say it&rsquo;s potassium 20 say magnesium</p>
<p>and the final 20 say that it is zinc</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s right doc</p>
<p>unfortunately no one&rsquo;s right this time</p>
<p>iron deficiency worldwide so that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>iron deficiency and</p>
<p>um a couple reasons for it but um</p>
<p>iron is the bioavailable type of iron</p>
<p>that you would get is in like animal</p>
<p>products especially red meat</p>
<p>um a lot of women are anemic they&rsquo;re low</p>
<p>in iron because of menstruation but um</p>
<p>you also have if you consume a lot of</p>
<p>cereal or bread or pasture grains you</p>
<p>have this phytic acid that can also</p>
<p>block iron</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>iron is the number one</p>
<p>in fact like six and a half percent of</p>
<p>all of your enzymes in your body need</p>
<p>iron it&rsquo;s not just for your hemoglobin</p>
<p>the carry oxygen it&rsquo;s for a lot of</p>
<p>different things so</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re not consuming animal</p>
<p>products</p>
<p>um you have to watch out for being</p>
<p>deficient in iron</p>
<p>on the flip side if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a male and you</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t menstruate them obviously</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>conditions that uh</p>
<p>you can have too much iron so you have</p>
<p>to be careful about getting too much</p>
<p>iron and uh if you have that problem</p>
<p>because our bodies have a hard time</p>
<p>getting rid of iron anyway so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming a lot of iron especially in</p>
<p>supplements or other other things</p>
<p>um cookware things like that that can</p>
<p>create a lot of problems for you</p>
<p>especially in the liver and so you can</p>
<p>probably pick that up on a DNA test as</p>
<p>well all right that&rsquo;s great and you know</p>
<p>audience I didn&rsquo;t know the audience the</p>
<p>answer to that either and Shucks if we</p>
<p>knew the answer to every question then</p>
<p>we would never learn anything so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nice to be stumped once in a while and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;re going to perform</p>
<p>even more marvelously as we move forward</p>
<p>uh and let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;ve got I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to bring you on yet Danny but Danny is a</p>
<p>is a principal or owner of a school in</p>
<p>Chicago and his his feed is kind of</p>
<p>jumping off and on and I know he&rsquo;s busy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably got the paddle already for</p>
<p>the day no I don&rsquo;t think they do that</p>
<p>anymore but I sure got a lot of them and</p>
<p>I deserved every one of them anyway</p>
<p>Danny I am going to try right now and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if you would unmute yourself</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t get you on the</p>
<p>air to answer your question go ahead</p>
<p>Danny</p>
<p>are we good we&rsquo;re good go ahead with</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>okay first off Dr Berg I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>watching your show for a while I&rsquo;m one</p>
<p>of the biggest fans and you changed my</p>
<p>life this is one of the best days of my</p>
<p>life I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>show with you but I appreciate</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re doing for the world</p>
<p>with your your podcast</p>
<p>um and and I am uh part owner of the</p>
<p>action Institute I have the number one</p>
<p>hair school in Virginia and my question</p>
<p>is before I became a business owner I</p>
<p>was a professional athlete and a hard</p>
<p>thing for professional athletes is to</p>
<p>make the transition we we consume a lot</p>
<p>of calories</p>
<p>um we have a extreme uh intense workout</p>
<p>regimen once you retire and I retired in</p>
<ol start="2015">
<li>it&rsquo;s been pretty difficult so uh</li>
</ol>
<p>when I when I saw you on social media uh</p>
<p>I decided to try it fast and I tried it</p>
<p>for five days straight successfully</p>
<p>um and I took some vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>along with that like I said athletes are</p>
<p>extreme so I never did it fast before</p>
<p>and I just go to five days cold turkey</p>
<p>which is amazing</p>
<p>um and I got through it um I was</p>
<p>extremely</p>
<p>um energetic I got so much work done I</p>
<p>even exercised three days doing that</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>but after the fast maybe three weeks</p>
<p>because I was taking some supplements</p>
<p>um I I developed the kidney stone and it</p>
<p>was extremely painful uh it was a</p>
<p>calcium buildup and my and my kidneys so</p>
<p>I flushed it out with a bunch of water</p>
<p>um but my question would be how does a</p>
<p>professional athlete make the transition</p>
<p>to a a fasting lifestyle and a keto</p>
<p>friendly lifestyle safely without having</p>
<p>the risk of a keto uh kit</p>
<p>kidney stones</p>
<p>especially especially since um you know</p>
<p>one of the the most common type of</p>
<p>kidney stone is called a calcium oxalate</p>
<p>Stone and so um there&rsquo;s a couple factors</p>
<p>that make up the stone uh one is the</p>
<p>consumption of</p>
<p>food that has a lot of oxalates in it so</p>
<p>you want to avoid those foods and</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s in like almonds it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very high in almonds and almond flour</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a lot of Keto products it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also high in spinach which everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like pushing spinach on you</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s also high in um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>chocolate and even the sugar-free</p>
<p>chocolate it&rsquo;s in high in kiwis so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing avoiding those foods</p>
<p>but the other thing too is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible to get a kidney stone unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a super concentrated urine in in</p>
<p>your bladder or your kidneys so one</p>
<p>solution is to make sure you have at</p>
<p>least two and a half liters of fluid a</p>
<p>day I do not think it&rsquo;s even possible to</p>
<p>get a kidney stone if you have that much</p>
<p>fluid in your body it&rsquo;s not that much</p>
<p>but just make sure you drink more if you</p>
<p>add the lemon water in there that lemon</p>
<p>has citrates and the citrates combine</p>
<p>and block those that kidney stone from</p>
<p>forming so you put in like a good</p>
<p>you know you can do the juice of one</p>
<p>lemon or a couple tablespoons of lemon</p>
<p>just put that in your water several</p>
<p>times a day drink enough water that</p>
<p>right there should handle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your potential for getting kidney stone</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s say for example you were at a</p>
<p>restaurant and you had some spinach some</p>
<p>steamed spinach if you have some cheese</p>
<p>with that or dairy that calcium will</p>
<p>block block the oxalates so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to protect you but being an</p>
<p>athlete what happened is you developed</p>
<p>very large mitochondria you have a huge</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>uh Source now and then when people are</p>
<p>athletes and then they they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>operate at that level they have a lot of</p>
<p>extra energy that they need to sometimes</p>
<p>use or else they have sleeping problems</p>
<p>down the road so you have to mean some</p>
<p>type of exercise to kind of drain out</p>
<p>some of that energy that you built up</p>
<p>because your body is at a certain</p>
<p>capacity but I think um doing the</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um and the keto lifestyle with exercise</p>
<p>going forward is going to be the best</p>
<p>thing if you also do uh if you add in</p>
<p>that the next thing which I just did is</p>
<p>the cold immersion therapy now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking it to the next level so uh anyway</p>
<p>that was my long version of how to</p>
<p>prevent kidney stones on keto</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great thank you Danny I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad we got a clean shot out of your</p>
<p>internet and I get a produced a sports</p>
<p>show for 19 years a lot of Hall of</p>
<p>Famers from basketball and football and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think many people realize first</p>
<p>off the people that make it to that</p>
<p>level are one in a million and a</p>
<p>combination of discipline and and</p>
<p>god-given talent and determination and</p>
<p>gruesome level of physical fitness to</p>
<p>keep up in that kind of shape it makes</p>
<p>it look a little easy on the Gridiron</p>
<p>but man that&rsquo;s a lot of work and you</p>
<p>know they pay a heavy toll oftentimes</p>
<p>you know at the end of their career one</p>
<p>of the most poignant things in a sports</p>
<p>show is when we watch the guests try to</p>
<p>get up out of the chair after the</p>
<p>interview and sometimes that was a</p>
<p>painful process especially the people up</p>
<p>on the line anyway thank you so much</p>
<p>Danny and best luck in your your school</p>
<p>there and let&rsquo;s move on to the second</p>
<p>question and Doc this time you can read</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>okay true or false beta carotene is</p>
<p>vitamin A</p>
<p>is that true or is that false</p>
<p>seems fairly simple chew onto that</p>
<p>audience okay let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media so uh Patsy what a great name from</p>
<p>Facebook I have lost 90 pounds that is</p>
<p>tremendous in a year thanks to you I</p>
<p>have a problem with thinning hair I have</p>
<p>been talking uh I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking your hair formula but is there</p>
<p>anything else that I can do so</p>
<p>congratulations on that 90 pounds but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get her a full name back</p>
<p>well you know this relates to the next</p>
<p>question on my quiz</p>
<p>so I think what I&rsquo;m going to do I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to reserve that question if you</p>
<p>can come give me another question I want</p>
<p>to reserve that for because I&rsquo;m what</p>
<p>will happen is I&rsquo;ll ask the quiz and</p>
<p>everyone will hear the answer so just go</p>
<p>Fair hang in there because I have</p>
<p>something on this this one really Point</p>
<p>related to hair loss all right well</p>
<p>Patsy that&rsquo;s exciting you got a question</p>
<p>crafted all around your issues so you</p>
<p>stand by in the meantime Lilia from</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>is it safe to transition to keto while</p>
<p>in the first trimester of pregnancy</p>
<p>the only thing you need to watch out for</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in pregnant is to maybe not</p>
<p>do a lot of</p>
<p>strict fasting right but as far as the</p>
<p>type of foods I highly recommend the</p>
<p>healthy version of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>not just keto which is low carb because</p>
<p>you want those those quality</p>
<p>carbohydrate quality calories you you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need more carbs when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant in fact you can put the</p>
<p>infinite risk of getting problems with</p>
<p>diabetes and blood sugar problems and</p>
<p>insulin resistance it starts early on so</p>
<p>the most important time</p>
<p>to eat healthy is while you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>and then when you&rsquo;re breastfeeding and</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re going to breastfeed</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>then you actually can</p>
<p>give that</p>
<p>that child a chance to not develop</p>
<p>allergies and have a very strong immune</p>
<p>system a lot of the microbes that</p>
<p>fortify the gut you giving are in the</p>
<p>breast milk and not to mention all the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um support for like colostrum for the</p>
<p>immune system very very important</p>
<p>um versus the</p>
<p>infant formulas which they&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>out now which is I can&rsquo;t even believe</p>
<p>the ingredients in there sugar you know</p>
<p>terrible things so anyway</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I hope that answered that I think you</p>
<p>probably did okay so uh the question</p>
<p>number two is already answered and it</p>
<p>was a true false or Bader carotene is a</p>
<p>vitamin A</p>
<p>and uh 80 of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false uh and twenty percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true how they doing</p>
<p>if you if you um just take a look at</p>
<p>Vitamin A</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;ll say oh yeah there&rsquo;s uh Mass</p>
<p>amounts of vitamin A and spinach and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s massive amounts of vitamin A and</p>
<p>kale for example and I used to say that</p>
<p>as well but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been corrected and the thing is</p>
<p>that um beta-carotene is not the same as</p>
<p>Vitamin A it&rsquo;s a pre vitamin A thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a um it turns into Vitamin A but</p>
<p>only small amounts it&rsquo;s not the active</p>
<p>form of vitamin A so you can consume</p>
<p>beta-carotene from carrots it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily mean you&rsquo;re getting a lot of</p>
<p>the true retinol and retinol is um</p>
<p>very very good for many things but the</p>
<p>point is that</p>
<p>if you also do a genetic test which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing in a lot of people there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>certain percentage of those people that</p>
<p>have a very oh even a worse time of</p>
<p>converting beta-carotene into Vitamin A</p>
<p>so vitamin A the best foods for vitamin</p>
<p>A the active form would be egg yolks</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>animal products</p>
<p>cheese milk products things like that</p>
<p>even better</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to get a lot better</p>
<p>vitamin A and vitamin A is good for the</p>
<p>immune system it&rsquo;s good for the skin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for your sinuses it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>good for your vision at night when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving so you can see in the</p>
<p>dark</p>
<p>very important though for your skin</p>
<p>health and if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p>
<p>vitamin A you&rsquo;re going to notice that um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get kind of a a flaky</p>
<p>skin it could be a red skin it could be</p>
<p>thicker skin it really messes up the</p>
<p>skin in many different areas so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s so if you&rsquo;re deficient you</p>
<p>know you can end up with like really</p>
<p>poor skin so I think um</p>
<p>I may have just answered another one of</p>
<p>the questions on our quiz unfortunately</p>
<p>so Steve you need to start asking me</p>
<p>questions that are not related to the</p>
<p>quiz all right I&rsquo;m making you probably</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t identify that I&rsquo;m making a note uh</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s see now here&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting don&rsquo;t ask from YouTube so we</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t no this person&rsquo;s handle is don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ask and there&rsquo;s certain penalties for</p>
<p>that sometimes but we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>ahead and let you ask it anyway don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ask from YouTube please talk about the</p>
<p>pros and cons of taking creatine</p>
<p>on keto</p>
<p>well I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>help you</p>
<p>um with uh if you want to build some</p>
<p>muscle mass and have some energy while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s when I would recommend</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and um will it knock you out of ketosis</p>
<p>not of any significant level</p>
<p>um like if you were to take a protein</p>
<p>powder that would especially whey</p>
<p>protein powder but creatine is a little</p>
<p>bit different that&rsquo;ll actually that can</p>
<p>help um to a certain degree build a</p>
<p>little bit more muscle mass while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working out and give you a little more</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>but your body actually makes it and it</p>
<p>also comes from food</p>
<p>all right well uh concerning uh thing</p>
<p>from Rita at Facebook I&rsquo;m 69 and have</p>
<p>been diagnosed with ALS how much benefit</p>
<p>would I get from intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be massive if you combine</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>this is ALS is an autoimmune disease</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>if you were to do higher amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin D and I&rsquo;m talking about probably</p>
<p>40 or 50 000 IUS a day</p>
<p>and maybe you want to do that every</p>
<p>other day just to kind of keep it</p>
<p>sporadic sometimes you get better</p>
<p>absorption if you&rsquo;re not taking it so</p>
<p>consistently all the time maybe you take</p>
<p>a little bit more one day less another</p>
<p>day and then if you combine intermittent</p>
<p>I mean sorry just fasting prolonged</p>
<p>fasting I think those two combined would</p>
<p>be very very beneficial</p>
<p>to that disease so those those are the</p>
<p>two things I would recommend</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very good and we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>forget just who&rsquo;s listening to the show</p>
<p>and as usual every week we&rsquo;d like to</p>

<p>Qatar Cyprus and all across the United</p>
<p>States I tell you what a Terry our</p>
<p>producer I bet he hates the level of</p>
<p>viewership that you get Dr Burke because</p>
<p>his fingers must be swollen from typing</p>
<p>that in every week Terry hang in there</p>
<p>and thanks for all your efforts on that</p>
<p>so and thanks everybody of course</p>
<p>everyone in our Green Room uh that we</p>
<p>already had Danny on and then um you</p>
<p>know people from all over the United</p>
<p>States as Terry pointed out let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to social media with Facebook Gary</p>
<p>asked have you seen any studies about</p>
<p>using oxygen while cold plunging wow</p>
<p>what a setup I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any benefits to using oxygen with cold</p>
<p>exposures</p>
<p>you know I haven&rsquo;t but I have uh looked</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>um using CO2</p>
<p>with um cold therapy now you can</p>
<p>what happened you need a certain amount</p>
<p>of CO2 to get the oxygen in the cell</p>
<p>sometimes when you have too much pure</p>
<p>oxygen it can prevent the oxygen from</p>
<p>going in the cells because you need that</p>
<p>balance but there are certain certain</p>
<p>types of oxygen baths that are very</p>
<p>therapeutic because the goal is to kind</p>
<p>of for a lot of people is to get more</p>
<p>oxygen in your cells right but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>as simple as that it does take that</p>
<p>additional CO2 to help it go as far into</p>
<p>the cell as possible</p>
<p>when the cells that</p>
<p>um your your mitochondria when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually working uh the mitochondria</p>
<p>needs oxygen to work and if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have oxygen</p>
<p>it has a backup uh system to generate</p>
<p>energy and so it starts fermenting</p>
<p>things like in cancer when you damage</p>
<p>the mitochondria</p>
<p>it has a plan B to survive so it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>normal cell then starts converting over</p>
<p>into a cancer cell that doesn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>oxygen it can live without oxygen it has</p>
<p>no um</p>
<p>it can live forever it keeps reproducing</p>
<p>it it doesn&rsquo;t produce a lot of energy so</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean as far as efficiency goes so it</p>
<p>basically starts hogging up all your</p>
<p>sugar especially if you&rsquo;re consuming a</p>
<p>lot of sugar and um so</p>
<p>you know people think well I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to give the body oxygen to fix the</p>
<p>cancer well that may help in a certain</p>
<p>area but you really need to fix the</p>
<p>deeper thing which is the mitochondrial</p>
<p>damage and that really boils down to</p>
<p>you know understanding what foods heal</p>
<p>the body not focusing on trying to win</p>
<p>the war against cancer but preventing it</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s why a lot of my videos</p>
<p>might sound simple I keep talking about</p>
<p>the same message over and over and over</p>
<p>again but really establishing them a</p>
<p>diet that uh heals your body on a</p>
<p>regular basis uh is going to be the best</p>
<p>strategy so you can then avoid the the</p>
<p>Battle of a disease in general so many</p>
<p>people they say how do I get myself out</p>
<p>of this battle</p>
<p>it would have been a lot easier to</p>
<p>prevent the battle</p>
<p>my wife&rsquo;s words doc okay we&rsquo;ll go back</p>
<p>to our green room and Martine from</p>
<p>Canada now listen she&rsquo;s got a long list</p>
<p>written down I saw it but she&rsquo;s promised</p>
<p>to uh only give you a question in 30</p>
<p>seconds uh one question 30 seconds but I</p>
<p>I told her that you&rsquo;re going to dig out</p>
<p>of her what you need to know so enough</p>
<p>of my intro but Martine you&rsquo;re on notice</p>
<p>for one question 30 seconds go</p>
<p>go ahead Martin hi Dr Burke thank you</p>
<p>for this crisis eye doctor bird thank</p>
<p>you for this Priceless opportunity uh</p>
<p>for all your teaching it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>appreciated I&rsquo;m on keto since the last</p>
<p>three years I lost 40 pounds I&rsquo;m 62</p>
<p>years old now I&rsquo;ve just been diagnosed</p>
<p>with a subclinic hyperthyroidism due to</p>
<p>a multinodular goiter which a small</p>
<p>nodule called Art nodule seems to be</p>
<p>taking over</p>
<p>uh I&rsquo;m taking actually few natural</p>
<p>products to up to help calming down my</p>
<p>thyroid bottle weed lemon balm</p>
<p>electrolyte selenium vitamin C choline</p>
<p>design potassium magnesium and vitamin B</p>
<p>complex</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following your precious list of</p>
<p>ketos pro</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>now I I did some research and</p>
<p>cheese meat eggs have iodine so I cut</p>
<p>down on those not to have more much more</p>
<p>iodine for my thyroid now my question is</p>
<p>should I change my diet to leaf green</p>
<p>only</p>
<p>for a while to help me out</p>
<p>despite every other</p>
<p>products I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>yeah so this is a situation where um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s Graves is it do they</p>
<p>diagnose with Graves disease and</p>
<p>autoimmune hyperthyroidism no no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>goiter</p>
<p>the right thing by avoiding</p>
<p>um iodine because you have a</p>
<p>hyperthyroid it&rsquo;s working too much and</p>
<p>more iodine is going to create more of a</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um the other thing is that uh</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s really interesting about this</p>
<p>is you have a nodule a lot of times you</p>
<p>can get rid of a nodule by taking iodine</p>
<p>but not in your case you might want to</p>
<p>take things that potentially can block</p>
<p>iodine to a certain degree and the</p>
<p>cruciferous Foods would be the family of</p>
<p>things to start increasing beef up your</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables a little bit more</p>
<p>no pun intended but the other thing</p>
<p>um is a</p>
<p>make sure you avoid anything with bile</p>
<p>salts or the gallbladder formula because</p>
<p>that actually speeds up the thyroid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for a hypothyroid but not good for</p>
<p>a hyper</p>
<p>um and then the other thing is to uh I</p>
<p>think the only thing that I hear that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing you took the B complex</p>
<p>but you might benefit from a natural B1</p>
<p>just to vitamin B1 and probably a little</p>
<p>bit higher amounts so whatever it says</p>
<p>in the bottle take twice as much but B1</p>
<p>is really good for a hyperthyroid</p>
<p>situation and the last point I want to</p>
<p>make about this hyperthyroid especially</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>just developed it usually just something</p>
<p>that causes it and a there is a factor</p>
<p>of stress and I have no idea if you had</p>
<p>that but I do know that you could have a</p>
<p>stress-induced hyperthyroid problem that</p>
<p>came after some type of stress so if</p>
<p>that was the case I would do whatever I</p>
<p>can to resolve that</p>
<p>all right perfect thank you doctor that</p>
<p>is so wonderful you kept your promise</p>
<p>you went through that list quickly and</p>
<p>one question and that was just terrific</p>
<p>thanks for representing uh Canada so</p>
<p>wonderfully Quebec and um</p>
<p>to be specific all right let&rsquo;s go to the</p>
<p>next question on the list doctor and</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>out of all the vitamins which one is the</p>
<p>most important for the skin</p>
<p>so you think you may have given a hint</p>
<p>is that the one I think I think I have</p>
<p>given a hint all right well audience you</p>
<p>have little excuse on this one so I hope</p>
<p>you had your ears on and then let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>um social media just tons of great</p>
<p>questions here Rita from YouTube to</p>
<p>frozen vegetables have the same</p>
<p>nutritional content as fresh vegetables</p>
<p>slightly lower slightly lower but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a good amount of nutrition</p>
<p>and frozen vegetables so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely better than heating the</p>
<p>vegetables too much</p>
<p>but Frozen like even when you um when</p>
<p>you do freeze drying you retain you</p>
<p>actually have to freeze the thing and</p>
<p>then you basically take out the water</p>
<p>and they do it under under low pressures</p>
<p>and you preserve</p>
<p>almost everything like the enzymes the</p>
<p>vitamins other proteins and even the</p>
<p>microbes that are in that vegetable as a</p>
<p>because a lot of plants if they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sterilized to have microbes that are</p>
<p>beneficial to us so um</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not going to be that</p>
<p>much of a difference</p>
<p>if you freeze them okay can you give us</p>
<p>a hint so frozen broccoli I love it when</p>
<p>do you go past the point of you know</p>
<p>healthy cooking it or steaming it I mean</p>
<p>when when does it become damaging to</p>
<p>heat it up I don&rsquo;t eat a frozen broccoli</p>
<p>spear</p>
<p>if we take a look at</p>
<p>um vitamins and enzymes</p>
<p>um that are in these these Foods they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very susceptible to heat</p>
<p>and oxygen</p>
<p>and Light</p>
<p>so it really depends on like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain vitamins and enzymes that are</p>
<p>more susceptible to heat than other</p>
<p>things and at certain temperatures they</p>
<p>survive</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have all those facts or figures</p>
<p>but I will say something very</p>
<p>interesting about this</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s take the nutrient omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids right DHA and EPA</p>
<p>I was in the assumption that if you</p>
<p>heated it up it would kill them but</p>
<p>apparently they survive a good amount of</p>
<p>heat and even the heat that they would</p>
<p>use to make the sardines or not make</p>
<p>them but process sardines they have to</p>
<p>heat them up to pretty high temperatures</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the amounts but</p>
<p>I actually did a test on the Omega-3s</p>
<p>and some</p>
<p>some sardines and I found that there</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>Sky High I was surprised so apparently</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain nutrients that can</p>
<p>survive heat and cold thank goodness</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see now oh</p>
<p>Quincy boy the audience is lightning</p>
<p>fast today and they&rsquo;ve already gotten</p>
<p>through what you guessed they might uh</p>
<p>with this question of all the vitamins</p>
<p>which one is the most important for the</p>
<p>skin uh but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not a quorum</p>
<p>here 65 percent of respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vitamin A 15 say it&rsquo;s vitamin C 15 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vitamin E and five percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vitamin D is in doggy so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>over the place</p>
<p>well the answer is vitamin A vitamin A</p>
<p>uh protects protects the skin against a</p>
<p>lot of things against it turning into</p>
<p>some something that is not really good</p>
<p>skin so it&rsquo;s a very very uh important</p>
<p>vitamin in both external skin and</p>
<p>internal skin like all the lining of</p>
<p>your sinuses your throat your esophagus</p>
<p>your colon all needs vitamin A so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really important thing and like I said</p>
<p>before you can get vitamin A and eggs</p>
<p>egg yolks</p>
<p>um animal products organ Meats</p>
<p>especially</p>
<p>seafood and Dairy</p>
<p>all right so here&rsquo;s one Sophie from</p>
<p>YouTube is it possible to be a vegan and</p>
<p>do healthy keto we&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch</p>
<p>of folks in India that would probably be</p>
<p>interested in that comment and elsewhere</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s possible it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>difficult because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more difficult to get your carbs</p>
<p>down get your protein higher consume the</p>
<p>biovaluable type of protein and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also like that you have the B12 so you</p>
<p>have to you have to take certain</p>
<p>supplements you have to try to get your</p>
<p>protein from various sources maybe you</p>
<p>can get it from nuts but</p>
<p>um and then maybe you get some from</p>
<p>nutritional yeast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing but it&rsquo;s just a little</p>
<p>bit more difficult to get um</p>
<p>certain nutrients you could probably get</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids from algae but I</p>
<p>think one</p>
<p>neglected source of nutrition for a</p>
<p>vegan would be spirulina</p>
<p>because spirulina</p>
<p>I mean the Nassau&rsquo;s research that</p>
<p>extensively and it&rsquo;s like great protein</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amino acids it has chlorophyll has</p>
<p>almost every vitamin so it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you know maybe you&rsquo;re just drinking</p>
<p>a shake or something and</p>
<p>um get the benefit of the spirulina</p>
<p>interesting okay Carrie from Facebook</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on drinking</p>
<p>carrot juice</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have good thoughts about that I</p>
<p>did it at one time in my life</p>
<p>um I turned orange but it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking so much sugar without the fiber</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna definitely spike your</p>
<p>blood sugars and it&rsquo;s not of course</p>
<p>equivalent to eating</p>
<p>uh you know or drinking uh soda or fruit</p>
<p>juice but you&rsquo;re still getting a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of juice with some</p>
<p>good nutrition too but the fiber is gone</p>
<p>so I would</p>
<p>recommend consuming the fiber with the</p>
<p>carrot juice as in a whole carrot</p>
<p>all right there you have it well I love</p>
<p>these questions for me it is ones that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to ask bird lover from YouTube</p>
<p>how much vitamin C can we take safely on</p>
<p>a daily basis maybe to follow that up</p>
<p>how much is good for you</p>
<p>the normal um rdas for vitamin C are</p>
<p>roughly about 7 70. 70 milligrams</p>
<p>um but if you get your vitamin C</p>
<p>naturally</p>
<p>um you can I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>limit</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s like like sauerkraut raw</p>
<p>sauerkraut not the pasteurized stuff or</p>
<p>the stuff this process has to say raw</p>
<p>um one cup of that is 700 milligrams</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah 10 times the normal amount but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry about that but when</p>
<p>people take ascorbic acid as Vitamin C</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking one part of the vitamin C</p>
<p>complex they might take</p>
<p>grams like thousands of milligrams</p>
<p>and even with a certain cancer therapy</p>
<p>down in Mexico you can go down there and</p>
<p>get injected with a hundred thousand</p>
<p>milligrams of uh vitamin C I&rsquo;m like just</p>
<p>massive amounts for cancer therapy which</p>
<p>um it may work but there is some side</p>
<p>effects that come with too much ascorbic</p>
<p>acid one diarrhea second one you may</p>
<p>have problems with your spider veins</p>
<p>uh or even hemorrhoids because in nature</p>
<p>vitamin C comes in a complex you have</p>
<p>the bioflavonoids things like that to</p>
<p>protect you</p>
<p>um against certain things so</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my answer I&rsquo;m sticking to it all</p>
<p>right very good uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to the green room and uh Danny from</p>
<p>George has been extraordinarily patient</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t made any bad faces or anything</p>
<p>like that so here he is and Danny as you</p>
<p>as you recall one question 30 seconds</p>
<p>hit it</p>
<p>try to mute yourself</p>
<p>all right Steve just to correct my name</p>
<p>is Rick I&rsquo;m from Alaska Georgia</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed and delighted I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>personally be able to tell you how</p>
<p>grateful I am that I discovered you</p>
<p>honor about May 6 this year</p>
<p>seven days later my wife and I embarked</p>
<p>on the max living advanced</p>
<p>plan</p>
<p>30-day diet</p>
<p>and it was just at the same time that I</p>
<p>I ordered my first batch of Dr Berg</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>B1</p>
<p>D3 and K2</p>
<p>magnesium curcumin natural yeast and</p>
<p>yesterday I ordered the</p>
<p>benthamophene or you know I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>trying to get these words right</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>again the background</p>
<p>three years with chiropractor and that</p>
<p>Max living Association</p>
<p>taking supplements like D3 and curcumin</p>
<p>and all but I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;m comparing labels</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so again grateful for you my</p>
<p>question is is there as a newbie with</p>
<p>you is there any chance of like</p>
<p>taking too much of a specific item like</p>
<p>a B1 and I&rsquo;ve taken your recommended</p>
<p>daily dose but I know there&rsquo;s B1 which I</p>
<p>think is a little different</p>
<p>subcategory of B1 in the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>early guy you know just</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is there any</p>
<p>overdosing of vitamins okay so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>um not if you&rsquo;re taking something in the</p>
<p>normal complex like for example when you</p>
<p>take nutritional yeast it&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the B complex you&rsquo;re taking all the bees</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s more natural than taking a</p>
<p>very individual uh one vitamin now when</p>
<p>we get into like even</p>
<p>B1 if you&rsquo;re getting a natural version</p>
<p>versus a synthetic you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>run any problems with that in fact</p>
<p>a lot of the therapeutic benefits from</p>
<p>B1 occur with higher amounts of those</p>
<p>individual vitamins</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but there is a problem like um</p>
<p>and even like um you&rsquo;re taking I think</p>
<p>if I can d d D3 well what I did is I put</p>
<p>the cofactors that come with that</p>
<p>vitamin to allow it to work better so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that but</p>
<p>like vitamin K2 and magnesium and zinc</p>
<p>and B6 so I really designed</p>
<p>the nutritional</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the neutral nutritional products to</p>
<p>prevent</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>problems of deficiency</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that</p>
<p>at all I mean let&rsquo;s just take um</p>
<p>toxicity of vitamins</p>
<p>that topic like let&rsquo;s just take vitamin</p>
<p>D you would have to consume</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of international</p>
<p>units of vitamin D to potentially take</p>
<p>create a Toxic effect but you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>take those over months so that would</p>
<p>just be like you would never do that so</p>
<p>in reality</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t have to worry about taking</p>
<p>too much right now the real problem is</p>
<p>not taking in or just being deficient in</p>
<p>in nutrition at all I recently um did an</p>
<p>experiment and I&rsquo;m doing a lot of</p>
<p>experiments I&rsquo;m going to do more videos</p>
<p>on this and I I really have um attention</p>
<p>on our food supply so I went to the</p>
<p>store I bought some regular a pork chop</p>
<p>and um from the store and sent it in the</p>
<p>lab and to do a whole analysis on the</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals and then I sent in</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>a pork chop from an animal that was</p>
<p>actually more free-range it got a chance</p>
<p>to really get out of the pen and eat</p>
<p>healthier and I just got the results</p>
<p>back from just the minerals the minerals</p>
<p>were like three x higher and across the</p>
<p>board so</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have certain minerals</p>
<p>especially like trace minerals like zinc</p>
<p>manganese</p>
<p>what happens is like you can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>um make your Chemistry work</p>
<p>the enzymes don&rsquo;t work so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dependent on these trace minerals and</p>
<p>all the proteins not just your hair and</p>
<p>your nails but all the chemistry don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work without these they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>cofactors these minerals so</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re finding the food supply has</p>
<p>less and less and less of these</p>
<p>basic minerals so people are wondering</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re having problems with various</p>
<p>reasons because the food is just hard to</p>
<p>find food that has nutrition and this is</p>
<p>why I think supplementation is important</p>
<p>but then to make sure that supplement is</p>
<p>in in the right form that comes from</p>
<p>nature either a food concentrate or a</p>
<p>natural</p>
<p>vitamin so as a newbie I think</p>
<p>the most important thing to do now is to</p>
<p>implement that healthy keto so that way</p>
<p>you have the wide range and then kind of</p>
<p>substitute different things that you</p>
<p>might be deficient in and then then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll give you a good start and then</p>
<p>you could have more time to do a deep</p>
<p>dive on learning more and more as you</p>
<p>get into it</p>
<p>well Rick I think you&rsquo;re thank you Dr</p>
<p>Burke thank you okay Rick thanks so much</p>
<p>and welcome to the world of Dr Berg</p>
<p>products and all that I know you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>uh spectacular results I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>okay all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>next to the last question doc</p>
<p>okay so what is the most common cause of</p>
<p>kidney disease on planet Earth out of</p>
<p>all the causes of kidney disease like</p>
<p>end-stage kidney disease what would be</p>
<p>the most common reason for that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rooting for your audience speaking</p>
<p>of the audience let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media sauna from YouTube please give us</p>
<p>guidance on how to increase collagen</p>
<p>production</p>
<p>yeah and not I mean by having sufficient</p>
<p>amount of um protein and a good source</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not just taking uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>any any any old protein but like a</p>
<p>quality protein and the best protein to</p>
<p>get those amino acids would be eggs fish</p>
<p>meats that are high quality so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing collagen is also dependent on</p>
<p>vitamin C as well so without vitamin C</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to make collagen</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>and also you need zinc two to make make</p>
<p>collagen which is collagen is not just</p>
<p>um in your skin it&rsquo;s in the joints it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the uh</p>
<p>the connective tissue like the tendons</p>
<p>fascia ligaments</p>
<p>you have collagen in your bones</p>
<p>so um collagen is an important thing and</p>
<p>you definitely need to have um but</p>
<p>vitamin C is a good one</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but without vitamin C also vitamin C</p>
<p>also affects your adrenals too which is</p>
<p>not nothing to do with collagen but</p>
<p>I think vitamin C if you take Vitamin C</p>
<p>you can kill two birds with one stone it</p>
<p>works on a lot of different things</p>
<p>adrenal stress collagen support and</p>
<p>preventing symptoms like scurvy which is</p>
<p>the bleeding gums and spider veins</p>
<p>all right very good and as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>mentioned there&rsquo;s tons of good news we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to spend the whole hour</p>
<p>talking about it because there&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>questions however Teresa from Facebook</p>
<p>you are a godsend I&rsquo;ve lost 62 pounds</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>so no complaints at all out of Theresa</p>
<p>so thank you for that and let&rsquo;s see now</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go back to the Green Room</p>
<p>for last but not least Hyacinth from</p>
<p>Toronto an area that you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with let me unmute her and I assume that</p>
<p>you are also unmuted go ahead please</p>
<p>high sense with your one question in 30</p>
<p>seconds</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re still muted dear</p>
<p>muted</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>hello hi I&rsquo;m so excited to be on this</p>
<p>live chat so I&rsquo;m 62 years old uh in</p>
<p>menopause I&rsquo;ve tried your intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and it&rsquo;s been over a month now</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve not even lost a single pound I</p>
<p>do have a lot of bloating I do have a</p>
<p>lot of water retention and of course I</p>
<p>only take herbal supplements I&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>holistic nutritionist so my diet is</p>
<p>really clean I exercise but my weight</p>
<p>loss is a huge huge problem</p>
<p>so I have a question can you tell me</p>
<p>what your last meal was</p>
<p>my last meal was at 7 30 last night</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who I just had a simple chicken</p>
<p>soup that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>okay and then what did you eat just</p>
<p>before that</p>
<p>um I just had some I just had an apple</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not doing the keto I plan</p>
<p>to do it but because I&rsquo;m lactose</p>
<p>intolerant I can&rsquo;t really have cheese</p>
<p>that much okay so here&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend I would recommend um</p>
<p>implementing uh the no Dairy version of</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet so just kind of do</p>
<p>the program without the dairy because</p>
<p>the apples like even even myself when I</p>
<p>do apples there&rsquo;s a lot of fructose in</p>
<p>there boy I will burp I mean not burp I</p>
<p>will bloat I will feel bloated from that</p>
<p>very easily but if you do the ketogenic</p>
<p>plan with low sugars and you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to do dairy you don&rsquo;t even have to do</p>
<p>nuts</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to finally lose</p>
<p>weight because</p>
<p>keto is all about</p>
<p>um cutting down the carbs so you can</p>
<p>reduce your insulin and then the</p>
<p>presence of that insulin fat burning</p>
<p>cannot occur unfortunately</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um I think the combination I think you</p>
<p>mentioned you know intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but adding that keto in there is going</p>
<p>to be a huge help with your digestion</p>
<p>and finally losing the weight but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all really dependent on the level of</p>
<p>carbs that you&rsquo;re doing you got to keep</p>
<p>them under</p>
<p>50 grams but you know what if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vegetable carbohydrates don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about even counting anything just eat as</p>
<p>many of those as you can we want you to</p>
<p>eat more but these hidden things are a</p>
<p>problem if you really wanted to do a</p>
<p>good test</p>
<p>to find out</p>
<p>just to prove this point get an A1c</p>
<p>and they might even have a home test you</p>
<p>can get an A1c</p>
<p>that really gives you an average of your</p>
<p>blood sugars for three months</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>if a person does good on Monday and</p>
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday but the rest of</p>
<p>the week they don&rsquo;t do good that&rsquo;ll show</p>
<p>up on that test because it&rsquo;s an average</p>
<p>and shows up how much carbs and sugar</p>
<p>and it needs to be like below like 5.5</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I would want mine and a lot</p>
<p>of times it&rsquo;s like in the sixes</p>
<p>sometimes even seven and then that</p>
<p>explains why you&rsquo;re not losing weight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s those cheap days or there&rsquo;s times</p>
<p>you ate carbohydrates that unfortunately</p>
<p>prevents you from losing weight and this</p>
<p>is what happens with some people that</p>
<p>might might do intermittent fasting but</p>
<p>maybe not keto and they don&rsquo;t really see</p>
<p>the full benefits so</p>
<p>um bite the bullet get on keto and call</p>
<p>us back next week and then give us the</p>
<p>good results I will thank you so much</p>
<p>thank you very much sure thank you hi</p>
<p>synth from Toronto we appreciate that</p>
<p>and wish you all the best in your</p>
<p>persistence toward health</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see uh we have another</p>
<p>answer from the audience and they were</p>
<p>asked what is the most common cause of</p>
<p>kidney disease</p>
<p>and 72 percent say it&rsquo;s caused by high</p>
<p>levels of carbs and sugar or diabetes 18</p>
<p>say insulin resistance and 10 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caused by the evil alcohol</p>
<p>so uh the most common cause is diabetes</p>
<p>which is high carbs and insulin</p>
<p>resistance so whoever said that is</p>
<p>correct and there&rsquo;s other causes that</p>
<p>are not as common but they are causes</p>
<p>like side effect from prednisone or</p>
<p>certain medications that a person is on</p>
<p>or maybe some</p>
<p>some poisoning from some chemicals but</p>
<p>diabetes is at the top of the list and</p>
<p>so many people are on the kidney</p>
<p>transplant list</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and what they don&rsquo;t realize is that um</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a stage</p>
<p>one or two or even sometimes a stage</p>
<p>three they don&rsquo;t realize that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reversible</p>
<p>if they get the right foods and I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to release the video on that this</p>
<p>next week but there is a point of no</p>
<p>return if you actually wait too long</p>
<p>then it could be too long but I think</p>
<p>even even if you are on dialysis I would</p>
<p>at least try</p>
<p>to reverse it to see how far you can get</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen people being successful</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>stay tuned for that video it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be very interesting all right doc last</p>
<p>question for the day here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>can stress actually cause disease</p>
<p>okay well yes or no we don&rsquo;t know how Dr</p>
<p>Berg goes away with it because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>just high stress you can tell it just</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t calm down at all so Dr Berger</p>
<p>concluding an example oh yeah you know I</p>
<p>I guess um while we&rsquo;re on this uh this</p>
<p>last question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>somehow um the the first lady who asked</p>
<p>about the hair loss what else can I do</p>
<p>and this kind of ties in a little bit of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your hair is protein</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s made through a lot of different</p>
<p>biochemical reactions that are all</p>
<p>proteins and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in order to activate</p>
<p>these biochemical reactions and and</p>
<p>enzymes you need cofactors and the</p>
<p>biggest cofactors especially for hair</p>
<p>is there are certain trace minerals so</p>
<p>we have zinc</p>
<p>we have iron</p>
<p>we have selenium all three of those very</p>
<p>very important here so if you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>me what else I would do I would actually</p>
<p>take more trace minerals and give it a</p>
<p>little bit of time and see what happens</p>
<p>with your hair</p>
<p>all right good luck with that wonderful</p>
<p>recap there let&rsquo;s see uh Sarah from</p>
<p>Facebook my daughter is on keto for</p>
<p>epilepsy and her Physicians are trying</p>
<p>to get her off of it because her high</p>
<p>calcium levels in her kidneys speak of</p>
<p>the Devils they are combating her</p>
<p>acidosis with baking soda can you</p>
<p>recommend any alternatives to keep her</p>
<p>on keto</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really get acidosis unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s almost impossible and then</p>
<p>you and even if you are a diabetic type</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>and then you still have insulin to</p>
<p>regulate it so to prevent this</p>
<p>ketoacidosis so I&rsquo;m not saying you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it because maybe you do have type 1</p>
<p>diabetes which means that you need to</p>
<p>take your insulin to regulate that but</p>
<p>um ketoacidosis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know baking soda because of the pH</p>
<p>but also one thing about um</p>
<p>um that you could take as a good remedy</p>
<p>is more or enough B1 B1 tends to really</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>any type of problem with something</p>
<p>called lactate or lactic acid</p>
<p>so that helps to kind of get rid of that</p>
<p>in the body but you have to take a good</p>
<p>amount of it but take a natural version</p>
<p>of that the problem that I see with a</p>
<p>lot especially the kids that are doing</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet the standard</p>
<p>ketogenic diet for epilepsy is they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the healthy version of it so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of I mean digestive</p>
<p>problems low quality type fats and oils</p>
<p>that are like I would not even eat if I</p>
<p>were you so</p>
<p>I started this project I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>finished it and maybe I created a video</p>
<p>on it I think I did</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to do the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and if you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you have epilepsy and then the only</p>
<p>difference</p>
<p>only tweaked to that the current dot</p>
<p>that I recommend is that you want your</p>
<p>ratio</p>
<p>like four to one you want four times as</p>
<p>much fat to one protein so basically you</p>
<p>just need to increase more fat</p>
<p>so we can get more more into ketosis</p>
<p>um if you complement that by a good</p>
<p>amount of salads like I always recommend</p>
<p>then now we have the alkaline</p>
<p>countering some of the acidity from all</p>
<p>the ketones from the fat</p>
<p>so I think a combination of</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet with some</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and making sure</p>
<p>that you do a little more fat I think</p>
<p>that would be a solution</p>
<p>to this uh problem that you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>up against</p>
<p>all right very good final question of</p>
<p>the day ask can stress actually cause</p>
<p>disease and ta-da a hundred percent of</p>
<p>respondents say yes stress can in fact</p>
<p>cause illness how do we do if our final</p>
<p>question Dr Berg it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s totally true</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting because</p>
<p>how does stress cause</p>
<p>actual ulcers or viruses coming out of</p>
<p>remission or an immune susceptibility or</p>
<p>even an autoimmune disease how could</p>
<p>stress actually or even cancer that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just kind of strange right you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>taking necessarily a poison you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating pure sugar</p>
<p>or are you well chronic stress</p>
<p>mobilizes a lot of glucose and it it</p>
<p>also converts it causes your body to</p>
<p>make a lot of sugar</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re basically when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through stress you&rsquo;re eating sugar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a different pathway it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>stress pathway it&rsquo;s called flight or</p>
<p>fight you know you need that quick</p>
<p>energy but then it it comes back on you</p>
<p>but yeah so there&rsquo;s a lot of diseases</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna release a video on</p>
<p>this pretty much</p>
<p>all the diseases that come from eating</p>
<p>too much sugar also are the same</p>
<p>diseases that occur when you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>chronic stress just because the nature</p>
<p>of what it does to glucose</p>
<p>also stress paralyzes your immune system</p>
<p>to the point where</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can you&rsquo;re very susceptible to</p>
<p>getting infections</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I mean an average person has to actively</p>
<p>and aggressively do things to keep</p>
<p>stress out of their body</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t just avoid it because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible but</p>
<p>exercise going for long walks doing</p>
<p>physical work around the house</p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s a great book I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have in front of me but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by a coach</p>
<p>who trained um uh some of the top</p>
<p>athletes and he because of him he helped</p>
<p>37 athletes get World Records</p>
<p>and I think if I&rsquo;m not mistaken in</p>
<p>sprinting events or track and field</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>you know what his uh secret was Steve</p>
<p>are you ready for this drumroll</p>
<p>it was basically being calm during these</p>
<p>events to be as totally relaxed actually</p>
<p>trained as athletes on actively relaxing</p>
<p>so relaxing their body they had to</p>
<p>practice relaxing like all the tension</p>
<p>in their body and you know if the</p>
<p>tensions in the jaw and the mouth and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s before the event and during the</p>
<p>event a lot of these athletes when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re running they would relax their</p>
<p>hands to be relaxed and you see this a</p>
<p>lot with top athletes that are very</p>
<p>successful</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re just really relaxed and calm</p>
<p>versus the other ones that are kind of</p>
<p>uptight and they might end up hurting</p>
<p>themselves when they start doing some</p>
<p>athletic event but I will release a</p>
<p>video on that topic as well but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of a</p>
<p>um a concept of changing your viewpoint</p>
<p>not just during exercise but in just</p>
<p>running in life and when you eat and</p>
<p>everything you do just to try to</p>
<p>maintain a low stress attitude</p>
<p>um and I think for your health it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be important why because stress</p>
<p>causes disease so</p>
<p>all right Glenn from YouTube is Coke</p>
<p>Zero okay for type 2 diabetic it</p>
<p>indicates it contains no sugar</p>
<p>what is the sweetener is it sucralose</p>
<p>what is what what sweetener do they use</p>
<p>in that I&rsquo;m not sure I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>the blue stuff it&rsquo;s not Splenda it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other one oh aspartame yeah</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s going to affect your gut</p>
<p>microbiome</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not to mention the phosphoric acid in</p>
<p>that coke the phosphoric acid is not</p>
<p>good for your bones and it could be</p>
<p>caffeine in there and also the caramel</p>
<p>coloring it creates a little bit of a</p>
<p>glycation which is kind of makes your uh</p>
<p>proteins in your blood kind of sticky so</p>
<p>other than that I think it&rsquo;s perfectly</p>
<p>fine that&rsquo;s great by the way we would</p>
<p>like to as always remind the audience</p>
<p>that they can download this great Dr</p>
<p>Berg app it&rsquo;s now available on Apple and</p>
<p>also on the other operating system so uh</p>
<p>make sure you download that it&rsquo;s a just</p>
<p>a vast wealth of knowledge in your</p>
<p>pocket so that is terrific and um so</p>
<p>what else you got doc</p>
<p>well I think we had two minutes but now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re down to one minute left</p>
<p>do we do do we want to just uh wrap up</p>
<p>or do we want to add some words of</p>
<p>wisdom or do you have one glass question</p>
<p>Steve so why don&rsquo;t we do one last</p>
<p>question and we&rsquo;ll uh introduce that</p>
<p>call that out with music let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>and we did the collagen Grace uh</p>
<p>oh here we go this is a an important</p>
<p>question Grace from Facebook what do you</p>
<p>recommend to Aid with constipation</p>
<p>constipation either probably increase</p>
<p>or decrease your fiber</p>
<p>vegetables usually you you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you um sometimes you have</p>
<p>too much fiber and that can constipate</p>
<p>you and the other thing is bile salts</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re lacking bile that will</p>
<p>constipate you because biolubricates the</p>
<p>colon you also have B1 if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in B1 you can you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the peristalsis and then the last cause</p>
<p>would be a problem with the</p>
<p>um a probiotic you need more uh Flora or</p>
<p>good bacteria in your gut to be able to</p>
<p>eliminate properly on that note Steve</p>
<p>have a wonderful weekend we&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>next week and thank you for attending</p>
<p>this show</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
