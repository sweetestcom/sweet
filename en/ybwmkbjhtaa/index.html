I&rsquo;m having a video up I</p><p>mean a picture up right now we&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>look at the progression of where he came</p><p>from where he is now because people</p><p>wanted to know</p><p>is he still maintaining his way how was</p><p>he doing so I think it&rsquo;s been like 3</p><p>years now right oh yeah</p><p>3 years of Socktober 6 since I started</p><p>awesome first of all they&rsquo;re not gonna</p><p>believe that you were 600 pounds right</p><p>exactly</p><p>but you were 600 pounds yeah 610 yeah</p><p>Wow</p><p>let me just can I just recap on your how</p><p>you got that big because you know like</p><p>you weren&rsquo;t born 600 pounds how did you</p><p>end up being 600 pounds um just I was I</p><p>was always like 375 most of my life and</p><p>then I kind of quit working at a really</p><p>physical job and I moved to a city and I</p><p>had a more sedentary job and it&rsquo;s this</p><p>slowly kind of crept on and crept on</p><p>over about a 8-year period 10 year</p><p>period and the problem was I got so big</p><p>then I was like oh I&rsquo;m gonna try</p><p>tomorrow and then 3 4 years later you</p><p>know it just it just happened and then</p><p>all of a sudden I made a decision to</p><p>start and then I lost and capped it off</p><p>and it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve tried like yeah as I told</p><p>you before trying to lose it all those</p><p>other ways it never worked you know</p><p>until I started Aikido and it&rsquo;s probably</p><p>been you know the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever</p><p>done and it&rsquo;s been pretty easy actually</p><p>to do it and you also did in a minute</p><p>fasting - right I&rsquo;ve been doing</p><p>intermittent fasting now for a year and</p><p>3 months I have one meal a day I&rsquo;m a 23</p><p>while I may be 23 and a half I have one</p><p>meal a day and that&rsquo;s it</p><p>okay yeah so so here you are 600 pounds</p><p>it seems to me that if you&rsquo;re 600 pounds</p><p>literally I can&rsquo;t imagine how your knees</p><p>would feel walking going up stairs going</p><p>on an airport singing in a plane like</p><p>times it&rsquo;s just like a whole different</p><p>different experience I can&rsquo;t imagine</p><p>what was it like</p><p>it was tough like I was for 600 pounds I</p><p>was fairly mobile but like going up and</p><p>down stairs it was tough going into</p><p>sitting in a booth summer if it was a</p><p>booth instead of a chair or chairs with</p><p>arms and then of course the plane I had</p><p>to have the arm up and then it&rsquo;s the</p><p>poor guy sitting beside me right so it</p><p>was tough everything you kind of had to</p><p>plan out your your challenge right it</p><p>was everything was logistics or she</p><p>couldn&rsquo;t sit there be there it was tough</p><p>what did you ever notice people looking</p><p>at you pointing to you or anything like</p><p>that that was probably my worst one that</p><p>can supermarkets you know everybody</p><p>would look at you and they were kind of</p><p>sneer but it was a little kids they</p><p>would like point to their moms like look</p><p>how fat that boy look how fat that man</p><p>is mom and then of course their moms to</p><p>be embarrassed but there was a lot of</p><p>that because you didn&rsquo;t really realize</p><p>how big you were until you see picture</p><p>you&rsquo;re standing beside somebody else and</p><p>then you don&rsquo;t when you&rsquo;re that big you</p><p>don&rsquo;t think well I&rsquo;m not that big that&rsquo;s</p><p>not that bad so I wanna I want to dig</p><p>into what you just said there because I</p><p>suspected that you haven&rsquo;t really</p><p>confronted or face yourself in the</p><p>mirror you&rsquo;re probably going around</p><p>thinking okay you know you&rsquo;re probably</p><p>not looking at the mirror yourself</p><p>inspecting right now no no it&rsquo;s when you</p><p>get beside somebody and then somebody</p><p>points out then you&rsquo;re like okay I gotta</p><p>take a look at this and then you kind of</p><p>brush it off and there&rsquo;s lots of denial</p><p>when you&rsquo;re that big it&rsquo;s like</p><p>everything else like oh I don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>problem I don&rsquo;t have and then you</p><p>actually really do that&rsquo;s just amazing</p><p>cuz I did have one gal she was very</p><p>large and she the reason what got her to</p><p>change as she saw a shadow of herself</p><p>and she didn&rsquo;t recognize a shadow I&rsquo;m</p><p>like I mean don&rsquo;t you look in the mirror</p><p>like she didn&rsquo;t happen just didn&rsquo;t see</p><p>it just kind of block that out so wow I</p><p>always knew it was there but I was like</p><p>oh yeah tomorrow I can get on it</p><p>tomorrow start I can do it tomorrow and</p><p>but then you kind of get into routine as</p><p>like tomorrow turns into a month turns</p><p>into six months turns into a year yeah</p><p>and you know it&rsquo;s always a tough thing</p><p>because you&rsquo;ve tried like I tried like</p><p>all the JT craves the diet standards</p><p>like all the stuff I could possibly read</p><p>that you know the low fat stuff it never</p><p>worked I could last maybe a week or two</p><p>and then I couldn&rsquo;t do it and as I told</p><p>you before is Joe Rogan that&rsquo;s how I</p><p>kind of got on</p><p>kyoya&rsquo;s watch his podcast and it was</p><p>something intriguing and then I kind of</p><p>got onto Jimmy Moore I got on to you and</p><p>I did my research for like a month like</p><p>I found out the beginning September and</p><p>I started doing my research I got onto</p><p>you and then Stephanie this three you</p><p>basically got me started and then I</p><p>started doing keto and then once I</p><p>started it was just the most amazing</p><p>thing and it was easy and I could stay</p><p>on it you know one month turned into two</p><p>months to three months and I started</p><p>sleeping you know the weight started</p><p>coming off and it was pretty pretty easy</p><p>so easy because you you weren&rsquo;t hungry</p><p>or because you could eat fatty foods I</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t hungry the biggest thing was the</p><p>first two three weeks yeah I had you</p><p>know the keto flu or I was going through</p><p>the withdrawals it was a little tough</p><p>but then after that I was you know</p><p>eating the three meals a day I was</p><p>having the bacon the eggs you know I was</p><p>eating pretty good food so it was really</p><p>easy and I was dropping weight pretty</p><p>good but my problem at the beginning was</p><p>I was reading too many books really you</p><p>know up to fat have all this fat I was</p><p>taking MCT oil and I was adding all that</p><p>stuff on and it was then after about</p><p>probably six months I wasn&rsquo;t losing that</p><p>much well I was losing weight but not as</p><p>much as I thought it was should be</p><p>that&rsquo;s right I told you I reached out to</p><p>Tristan then you just had on and I</p><p>actually hired him as my keto coach and</p><p>he basically turned me around and said</p><p>hey cut out all that extra fat that mc2</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just eat natural food have that the</p><p>fat in your hamburger you know start</p><p>cutting some of your meals down don&rsquo;t do</p><p>what they&rsquo;re seeing just get really</p><p>simple and eat whole food so once I did</p><p>that that&rsquo;s when I really shot down like</p><p>I shot down real then I stole it again</p><p>and I started watching you and you</p><p>started talking about internet fasting</p><p>that&rsquo;s where I started you know a year</p><p>and a half ago May and then I really</p><p>jumped my last big done because I was</p><p>having a little bit of problems again</p><p>with the three meals a day you know</p><p>doing here the two meals a day then I</p><p>really got down an intimate fasting and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing that now for a year and</p><p>a half and I wouldn&rsquo;t do one mill and I</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t even eat two meals a day now</p><p>it&rsquo;s so easy and like traveling and</p><p>going to friends I have one meal a day</p><p>and sometimes they don&rsquo;t eat that meal</p><p>if I&rsquo;m too busy</p><p>and I go two days how much how much do</p><p>you weigh now I&rsquo;m down to 248 it&rsquo;s been</p><p>kind of a weird year I was 264 last year</p><p>in our interview I got down to 248 but I</p><p>dropped a couple close sizing and waist</p><p>sizes but I&rsquo;m actually I have a scale</p><p>that imma keep an eye on my like you</p><p>know my body fat and my muscle</p><p>I gained 18 pounds of muscle on this</p><p>last year so it&rsquo;s kind of a it&rsquo;s been a</p><p>weird year I haven&rsquo;t lost like a ton of</p><p>weight but I&rsquo;m still happy I lost you</p><p>know down to 248 but I&rsquo;ve actually put</p><p>on a lot of muscle so I always wanted to</p><p>get down at 225 but I think I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>kind of be in this area this 242 248 I</p><p>do have a few more pounds Liz but it</p><p>hasn&rsquo;t slowing down for me but I keep</p><p>going up through my muscle every month</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing 2 pounds to a pound of muscle</p><p>because I&rsquo;ve been working out five days</p><p>a week doing a lot of weights Wow so</p><p>this whole thing about weight near the</p><p>end kind of gotta throw it aside go on</p><p>your clothing size like that&rsquo;s a big one</p><p>for me I went from a 3x now I&rsquo;m down to</p><p>an extra-large 2x depends are closed I</p><p>went from a 40 38 waist ill at 36 38 and</p><p>just the whole shape of your body has</p><p>changed so you know everybody&rsquo;s worried</p><p>about the scale I don&rsquo;t you know in this</p><p>last year I just don&rsquo;t really care about</p><p>it I kind of know I feel clothing size</p><p>but I&rsquo;m gaining weight I know it&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of funny we&rsquo;re all trying to lose weight</p><p>but I&rsquo;m gaining I&rsquo;m getting the right</p><p>kind of weight in muscle yeah did they</p><p>ever do an ultrasound or any type of</p><p>test that that you detected a fatty</p><p>liver back then I know I&rsquo;ve never did</p><p>any tests I&rsquo;m actually going my doctor</p><p>right now of my cholesterol my LDLs a</p><p>little high and I keep trying he&rsquo;s</p><p>trying to put me back on statins but my</p><p>HDL super high so I&rsquo;ve talked him into</p><p>sending me to a cardiologist to get</p><p>those tests that we talked about to get</p><p>that done so I&rsquo;m actually just in the</p><p>process of gonna go to a cardiologist</p><p>who can in Canada here can run those</p><p>tests we don&rsquo;t we have free medical here</p><p>so my doctor&rsquo;s gonna send me to</p><p>cardiologist to get attempts for the LDL</p><p>because I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>want to go on statins you know you know</p><p>I I&rsquo;m in really good health now and I</p><p>know what you&rsquo;ve explained it many times</p><p>so is a lot of people you know I have</p><p>like a 1.57 HDL and my LDL is four point</p><p>seven he&rsquo;s concerned I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m not</p><p>worried about it I&rsquo;m like is it which</p><p>size is it he&rsquo;s like oh I can&rsquo;t tell you</p><p>because the tests that I do I can&rsquo;t do</p><p>it so I got to go to a cardiologist</p><p>he&rsquo;ll run those other blood tests that</p><p>the lifted chest or whatever those are</p><p>called so I don&rsquo;t yeah we do so you know</p><p>no we&rsquo;re gonna we were just talking to</p><p>Dave Feldman is the cholesterol guru</p><p>he&rsquo;s coming to the summit and he&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>be we&rsquo;re just going through how we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna educate people on this because</p><p>it&rsquo;s a good point that keeps coming up</p><p>and I think it comes up because we&rsquo;re</p><p>obviously in in um you know brainwashed</p><p>into thinking cholesterol is bad but</p><p>here&rsquo;s some really interesting this</p><p>observations on cholesterol and and why</p><p>it might be high when you&rsquo;re keto it&rsquo;s</p><p>basically has to do with energy delivery</p><p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s all it has to do with</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing to do with anything else</p><p>but I just just got from Iver Cummings</p><p>who&rsquo;s also coming this research thing</p><p>that he sent me that totally concludes</p><p>that LDL cholesterol and total</p><p>cholesterol do not in any way shape or</p><p>form contribute to heart disease heart</p><p>attacks zero and so I have this paper</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna release it at release it at</p><p>the summit so well it didn&rsquo;t help us</p><p>here my doctor there was just an article</p><p>put out a probably on face book on all</p><p>the news that some big cardiologists</p><p>said that keto is terrible for us and</p><p>we&rsquo;re all gonna have heart attacks so he</p><p>brought that article up to me I said I&rsquo;m</p><p>not going on statins I&rsquo;ve been off it</p><p>forever</p><p>I&rsquo;ve never felt better you know he&rsquo;s a</p><p>little dip formula with your age and</p><p>when you we do the 10 here you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>at the 10% risk I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;ll take my</p><p>chances then he&rsquo;s like how about we go</p><p>into an agreement I&rsquo;ll send you the</p><p>cardiologist let him decide so that&rsquo;s</p><p>how I said okay if you want to send me</p><p>to another specialist yeah because they</p><p>don&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;ve lost all this</p><p>weight</p><p>in this time I actually had to show my</p><p>doctor pictures doesn&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done it he doesn&rsquo;t know how I eat once a</p><p>day he still can you know the doctors</p><p>are confused and yeah you know they&rsquo;re</p><p>on the old way so yeah the the more</p><p>educated they are the more educated they</p><p>are in the wrong information the more</p><p>the harder is to unfix their fixed ideas</p><p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost like that&rsquo;s why I</p><p>like working with younger doctors</p><p>doctors that are more open and there&rsquo;s</p><p>quite a few of them is a huge movement</p><p>of Doc&rsquo;s that are actually going into</p><p>more Quito so okay so now I have a</p><p>question like when you were when you</p><p>weighed 600 pounds did you have a</p><p>tremendous amount of food or did you</p><p>have a moderate amount of food but it</p><p>was mainly carbohydrates well what did</p><p>you eat ah I eat a lot of sandwiches I</p><p>was big into the breads and the deli</p><p>meats and then pizza and chips okay I</p><p>think that quite a bit but I didn&rsquo;t eat</p><p>a lot during the day what my worst thing</p><p>is I would get home from work and then I</p><p>would have way too much I never was big</p><p>into sugar so yeah I was I was a carb</p><p>guy you know they had to work sweets the</p><p>pizza I&rsquo;m single I&rsquo;m not married so I</p><p>would order food in or I would go buy</p><p>the stuff I liked and yeah I eat too</p><p>much because it was a comfort thing as</p><p>icky the worst thing was for me is like</p><p>you&rsquo;re working in you&rsquo;re busy and I&rsquo;m</p><p>just and you get home and you really</p><p>crave that and you want it so you want</p><p>so bad so you eat it but after you&rsquo;re</p><p>done eating to say that Pizza you feel</p><p>so shitty you&rsquo;re so down it&rsquo;s like that</p><p>whole mood side in crash like I know I</p><p>should have done this I should have went</p><p>to the gym I&rsquo;m no tomorrow I&rsquo;m not gonna</p><p>have this pizza and I went on that</p><p>battle for two years three years and</p><p>people have used to tell me you&rsquo;re</p><p>depressed but I didn&rsquo;t think I was the</p><p>best sons get up every day going to work</p><p>they&rsquo;re like you know you need to</p><p>smarten up so there&rsquo;s but my biggest</p><p>issue that I was having near the end my</p><p>I had water attention in my lower legs</p><p>and I died is probably my biggest</p><p>problem and too nowadays since I had</p><p>such bad water retention in my lower</p><p>legs they you know they would swell they</p><p>were like the redness I do have a skin</p><p>issue from that so my skin is fairly</p><p>weak so if I actually bump my</p><p>and my skin kind of peels like an onion</p><p>and there&rsquo;s nothing really we can do</p><p>about it it heals but I do have a little</p><p>bit after all of a sudden I have the</p><p>skin but I also have my lower shins</p><p>where I had the water retention that</p><p>skins never really gonna come back I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been told because of just the water</p><p>attention and your skin down there so</p><p>that was my worst thing and still I do</p><p>have quite a bit of a skin issue still</p><p>because you know I was in a deck so now</p><p>it&rsquo;s never gonna go away I&rsquo;ve been to a</p><p>couple Plastic Surgeons they tell me the</p><p>operations are huge like you know</p><p>they&rsquo;re gonna do like the upside down</p><p>tea cut it like it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re out for</p><p>six weeks they have drains in for me I&rsquo;m</p><p>happy with what I look like I do have</p><p>the skin but hey it&rsquo;s a reminder to</p><p>never get back there right I&rsquo;m not gonna</p><p>go do it it&rsquo;s $100,000 I have to do five</p><p>operations there&rsquo;s five different</p><p>operations to get rid of all the skin</p><p>and then you have all the scars I met an</p><p>age now I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m not gonna do it</p><p>cuz I don&rsquo;t want to be out for two years</p><p>no and it&rsquo;s a major operation so at the</p><p>end of the day it doesn&rsquo;t bother me you</p><p>know I&rsquo;ve been happy with it I kept had</p><p>this full year to go back and forth I&rsquo;ve</p><p>seen some specialists and you know I</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a pretty</p><p>major operation yeah yeah I could</p><p>imagine that well the positive note when</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing in a minute fasting like</p><p>you are that will improve some of it</p><p>over time yeah if you could actually do</p><p>periodic prolonged fasting let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p><p>say like every few months you go to 72</p><p>hours what will happen is like you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see even more change for</p><p>the skin because the amount of recycling</p><p>of the damaged proteins your body will</p><p>start sucking some of that back so that</p><p>will improve if you wanted to do that</p><p>yeah I do that like without even trying</p><p>because sometimes I go home or I&rsquo;m on a</p><p>trip somewhere and there&rsquo;s no food I</p><p>like all this it&rsquo;s you know it gets to</p><p>be eight o&rsquo;clock at night and I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>ate that day oh the skipping go to the</p><p>next night and eight o&rsquo;clock you know to</p><p>me I can go and I can go that far people</p><p>don&rsquo;t you know and I still work oh the</p><p>thing is I do pretty good like I do 45</p><p>minutes a pretty hard way today and I do</p><p>at least 35 minutes of cardio I do you</p><p>know cardio I do that five days a week</p><p>and you know I&rsquo;m getting little bit</p><p>older but like I&rsquo;ve had really good</p><p>gains and I&rsquo;m only I checked out my</p><p>protein because you guys are always</p><p>asking me I&rsquo;m doing about 50 grams a day</p><p>of protein between you know my hamburger</p><p>and say it&rsquo;s some cheese on it I do that</p><p>every day I kind of beat on a type of</p><p>guy that has five days we&rsquo;ve had a ton</p><p>of the same ish meal what I have</p><p>increased though is my salad I used to</p><p>have a smaller square cell and now I</p><p>have the one big one so and I&rsquo;m doing</p><p>more of a power greens I was always</p><p>eating kale now I&rsquo;m doing one called an</p><p>organic power mix it&rsquo;s just got arugula</p><p>spinach kale and some chars in it and I</p><p>have one of those everyday religiously</p><p>Lions so that&rsquo;s what I eat I you know</p><p>pretty simple if I go to a restaurant</p><p>you&rsquo;ll have a Caesar salad or a</p><p>hamburger no bun but you know I&rsquo;m down</p><p>to one meal at a half-hour a day and you</p><p>know I you know a couple times a day</p><p>twice a day which I didn&rsquo;t even feel</p><p>good so you know because you&rsquo;re opening</p><p>an event or something but 99% of the</p><p>time I&rsquo;m down to one meal half hour the</p><p>15 minutes it takes me to eat that meal</p><p>and that&rsquo;s all I have it and that&rsquo;s at</p><p>the end of the day I don&rsquo;t interfere I</p><p>don&rsquo;t eat in the morning I don&rsquo;t eat to</p><p>like 7:30 8 o&rsquo;clock at night after my</p><p>old day is done because I don&rsquo;t have</p><p>time and you know I&rsquo;ve never felt better</p><p>I guess probably the the biggest thing I</p><p>can tell people is intermittent fasting</p><p>is probably the only secret to this</p><p>whole to this whole like business that</p><p>we do but it takes a little bit of</p><p>determination and it takes a little bit</p><p>of skill but once you get on it and your</p><p>grocery bill goes down like I spend next</p><p>nothing on money and food like people go</p><p>out and they order all this stuff and I</p><p>you know I I I don&rsquo;t spend more than a</p><p>hundred $125 a month on food and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p><p>6 foot tall I&rsquo;m 47 years old and I eat a</p><p>pretty nice meal every day I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>so incredible incredible this is this is</p><p>good data an average person who&rsquo;s not</p><p>overweight in their lifetime</p><p>Toomes 56 tons of food and I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about the guy that&rsquo;s doing three meals</p><p>two snacks so I think I think we&rsquo;re</p><p>bodies really don&rsquo;t need as much as food</p><p>as we think but the cool thing is like</p><p>you&rsquo;re not doing low calories per se</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually having just roti</p><p>you&rsquo;re having a good meal yeah so</p><p>everyone says like hawking of the same</p><p>kind of stuff so i&rsquo;ll do two hamburger</p><p>patties that I make you know by hand and</p><p>I cook those at kind of mash them up</p><p>then I put some shredded cheese on it I</p><p>put some I use Frank&rsquo;s hot sauce and</p><p>then I put my spices on and have that on</p><p>top I put that back in the microwave</p><p>melt the cheese on top I have that last</p><p>so I have my big salad first I put my</p><p>spices on there add my olive oil mix</p><p>dressing I eat that first I&rsquo;m feeling</p><p>pretty full after that salad and then I</p><p>have my nice tasty hot meal at the end</p><p>and I&rsquo;m full and I&rsquo;m always satisfied in</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s like how can you be the same</p><p>thing every day just about well by the</p><p>time you go to eat your meal at you know</p><p>after 23 hours it looks pretty good to</p><p>you yes they see and that&rsquo;s all you need</p><p>because I know I need to have that salad</p><p>I need to have the nutrients and I</p><p>actually enjoy the salad for some reason</p><p>like why don&rsquo;t you cook like broccoli</p><p>why don&rsquo;t you just like to me doing all</p><p>those extra recipes you might get in a</p><p>habit of eating too much and you don&rsquo;t</p><p>really need it tell me that&rsquo;s really</p><p>that&rsquo;s all right</p><p>I&rsquo;m a sink I&rsquo;m a single guy I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>don&rsquo;t have time to sit there and cook</p><p>all these fancy they make keto meals and</p><p>the biggest thing that I&rsquo;ve had this</p><p>last year to go on besides this I&rsquo;ve</p><p>actually inspired quite a few people</p><p>that I know probably 10 to 15 Wow that</p><p>have done keto in the last year and I</p><p>don&rsquo;t really preach to them about you</p><p>know I tell them kind of how to start</p><p>out they ask me a lot of questions and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had people lose over a hundred</p><p>pounds sixty-five pounds</p><p>they&rsquo;ve never done better but people</p><p>don&rsquo;t believe me like my sister I was</p><p>just back home and she&rsquo;s been trying for</p><p>a year on Weight Watchers she&rsquo;s lost 5</p><p>pounds over the whole year I was home a</p><p>month ago and she&rsquo;s already down just</p><p>about 15 pounds she cannot believe it</p><p>and she&rsquo;s eating food that she never</p><p>would have ate on Weight Watchers and</p><p>now her other friends in her little</p><p>Weight Watchers group they&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>Iquitos so they kind of put Weight</p><p>Watchers aside and getting on keto</p><p>because you know for girls this little</p><p>tougher but I just but their problem is</p><p>they&rsquo;re eating a little too much the</p><p>beginning so I said why do you have to</p><p>have two for meatballs have two</p><p>meatballs I try to see everybody just</p><p>start cutting back your food</p><p>you can&rsquo;t just be open on keto to eat</p><p>five hamburgers ten pieces of bacon</p><p>salad you have to have portion control</p><p>and you don&rsquo;t need a left food you&rsquo;ll</p><p>feel fine so I didn&rsquo;t yeah I think I</p><p>think especially when you&rsquo;re doing in a</p><p>minute fasting like I tell people to do</p><p>it together in initial stages they know</p><p>they&rsquo;re not gonna go for a period of</p><p>time with eating and the mental thought</p><p>is like oh my I better eat as much as I</p><p>can because I&rsquo;m not gonna survive I&rsquo;m</p><p>like and then I&rsquo;ll listen you do it and</p><p>I&rsquo;m like well I&rsquo;m okay with this but the</p><p>problem is if you eat too much you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna be so freaking stuffed you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna feel comfortable you you can have</p><p>a decent meal because think about it</p><p>what you&rsquo;re burning is you&rsquo;re burning</p><p>also your own fat and that&rsquo;s part of the</p><p>meal between the meals any look big one</p><p>that people don&rsquo;t discuss enough is the</p><p>insulin when you eat a a meal I try to</p><p>tell this to the people that I&rsquo;ve helped</p><p>there&rsquo;s a credit people reach out to me</p><p>if you eat food you&rsquo;re I always telling</p><p>you have four to five hours after you</p><p>even put a bite full of know like you</p><p>know absolute just fat your insulins</p><p>gonna go up so you can&rsquo;t lose weight so</p><p>if you think you can eat this and have</p><p>another you know fat bomb or another</p><p>snack you&rsquo;re never gonna lose weight you</p><p>have to like my success runs like how</p><p>did you lose 340 pounds in two years</p><p>well I found a solution you need that a</p><p>whole bit of time where there&rsquo;s no food</p><p>in your body where that&rsquo;s how you lose</p><p>this weight you only meet that one meal</p><p>a day but I tell people don&rsquo;t go crazy</p><p>maybe do an eight hour eating window do</p><p>and then go down to a six hour and then</p><p>get down to a four hour and then if you</p><p>can&rsquo;t get really good get down to that</p><p>half hour just have one meal a day and</p><p>you you have to get rid of that insulin</p><p>in your body you&rsquo;re never gonna lose</p><p>weight it&rsquo;s a huge one yeah tonight I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing a webinar on in a minute fasting</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about a couple</p><p>things</p><p>related to what you just said which is</p><p>how much your insulin can within 24</p><p>hours of fasting your insulin drops by</p><p>70% so you drop in this insulin that is</p><p>the switch that allows you to now tap</p><p>into your own fat</p><p>get rid of inflammation and like even</p><p>like the swelling in your ankles that</p><p>was from all the starches and stuff it</p><p>was basically a severe probably a</p><p>vitamin b1 deficiency and that the heart</p><p>was working harder where but the other</p><p>thing is the diff when you when people</p><p>do keto sometimes they don&rsquo;t do enough</p><p>vegetables and this is what happens</p><p>they&rsquo;ll do well because they&rsquo;re dropping</p><p>insulin but then they&rsquo;ll plateau and one</p><p>of the reasons is because they don&rsquo;t</p><p>have the diversity of microbes in the</p><p>gut to make things like butyric acid and</p><p>these other things that help you take</p><p>you to one step further they&rsquo;ll they</p><p>help you with your blood sugars they</p><p>help with digestion I mean even</p><p>overweight people have a completely</p><p>different profile of microbes than</p><p>thinner people so I&rsquo;m on the same</p><p>wavelength is what you&rsquo;re talking about</p><p>since salad is the probably the most</p><p>important like and I&rsquo;m trying to get my</p><p>people that I&rsquo;m kind of coaching helping</p><p>out I&rsquo;m like you need to eat this big</p><p>salad first they&rsquo;re like I take five</p><p>white folds and I&rsquo;m full I&rsquo;m like just</p><p>trust me need it and eat it more it&rsquo;ll</p><p>be the best thing for you because the</p><p>protein is what I need for muscles and</p><p>it&rsquo;s giving me my little taste but I</p><p>actually enjoy the bigger salad and I</p><p>switched out about six months ago and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had better success I&rsquo;m feeling way</p><p>more satiated satisfied and having</p><p>double the salad and it you know it just</p><p>helps more and like everyone&rsquo;s like cool</p><p>you know your guts feel better your mood</p><p>feels better and it&rsquo;s weird doubling the</p><p>salad not the protein the protein</p><p>actually makes me feel worse then</p><p>doubling that salad and I mix I was</p><p>always straight on kale for so long but</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to find straight organic kale</p><p>salads yeah she cut it stuff so I they</p><p>have this thing called I found a really</p><p>good one power greens and it&rsquo;s got</p><p>everything in it I&rsquo;ve been happy on that</p><p>I still take a little bit of my vitamin</p><p>regimen see I still do my potassium and</p><p>my magnesium and my multivitamins and a</p><p>few of those I do that every day but you</p><p>know the secret is and I still got some</p><p>fat to lose but you know the really</p><p>weird thing in this last year is I&rsquo;ve</p><p>seen some people I go home and I&rsquo;ve only</p><p>lost 14 pounds us last year ish but</p><p>they&rsquo;re like holy God you got skinny</p><p>like they&rsquo;ve really noticed it for some</p><p>reason</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t lost a lot of weight I lost</p><p>way more weight in the past but this</p><p>last year</p><p>I&rsquo;m cuz I&rsquo;ve gone down in sizes but I&rsquo;ve</p><p>gained some muscle people are really</p><p>starting to notice now that you&rsquo;re</p><p>skinnier than the normal person I&rsquo;ve</p><p>never had that in the past I guess you</p><p>would say there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p><p>noticing now even guys at work I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>seen in a two weeks or like quite you&rsquo;re</p><p>looking skinnier and only I may be a</p><p>loss like a powder it&rsquo;s kind of a weird</p><p>one you know that sort of been seeing a</p><p>lot of it this year a lot of a lot more</p><p>people have noticed I&rsquo;ve lost a lot less</p><p>weight this year but you&rsquo;re kind of</p><p>shifting your body I don&rsquo;t know what it</p><p>is it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s become position a</p><p>couple things that happened with your</p><p>liver has to your body has to eat up all</p><p>that fat from the liver and even the</p><p>pancreas before you can truly get rid of</p><p>insulin resistance so you have a lot of</p><p>metabolic things happening internally</p><p>that are probably a priority it&rsquo;s like</p><p>rebuilding protein structures cellular</p><p>protein apparatuses versus just dumping</p><p>the excess energy which is fat so your</p><p>body has its own priority of what it</p><p>does and as long as you&rsquo;re shrinking</p><p>you&rsquo;re feeling good don&rsquo;t take it as a</p><p>loss one point I want to bring up with</p><p>the protein which I&rsquo;m in a total</p><p>agreement this is one thing we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to talk about at the summit is that I&rsquo;m</p><p>not going to kind of get off into two to</p><p>tactical but too much protein actually</p><p>makes your life a little bit shorter</p><p>because you&rsquo;re actually it puts a lot of</p><p>waste into the liver and things like</p><p>that yeah so people actually live longer</p><p>if they have the right amount of protein</p><p>not nothingjust</p><p>and in the formula dye use now which is</p><p>basically like I knew you like your size</p><p>probably about 50 50 55 grams of protein</p><p>per day which is yeah that&rsquo;s just like</p><p>that&rsquo;s eight ounces okay so per day and</p><p>if you have that much and don&rsquo;t go crazy</p><p>with too much you actually live longer</p><p>and especially new internment</p><p>fascinating you live a lot longer so</p><p>it&rsquo;s</p><p>really important especially with</p><p>longevity let&rsquo;s see what that big thing</p><p>that everybody tells me and so like if</p><p>you&rsquo;re working out you you know you</p><p>should be gaining muscle like I you know</p><p>kept track because there&rsquo;s some comments</p><p>made last year on your thing they&rsquo;re</p><p>like well if you&rsquo;re doing this and this</p><p>but I really kept track of the muscle</p><p>and I have gained quite a bit of muscle</p><p>it should I know because I&rsquo;m getting way</p><p>stronger but you don&rsquo;t need a lot of</p><p>this food and I have a lot of energy I</p><p>work all day you know I work around home</p><p>you know and then I go to the gym every</p><p>night and I still got I come home from</p><p>the gym I&rsquo;m more energized like if I</p><p>don&rsquo;t tell myself I got to eat I</p><p>probably forget about it cuz I&rsquo;m even</p><p>more pumped after working out so this</p><p>whole thing of you need all this food</p><p>for energy you need all this other stuff</p><p>once you get yourself converted over and</p><p>you can stick to the intimate fasting</p><p>like I just put a scare so you know the</p><p>biggest thing I&rsquo;ve been finding and all</p><p>these articles that are coming out</p><p>against us and say I think sugar</p><p>companies are after us I think the carb</p><p>companies are after us I think the</p><p>doctors at risk I keep saying no my</p><p>doctor keeps telling me to go on statins</p><p>I&rsquo;m like no way like you know so the</p><p>threat to a very large industry and I&rsquo;m</p><p>surprised we don&rsquo;t actually hear more</p><p>because think about how much money is</p><p>tied in with carbs oh it&rsquo;s hard you go</p><p>to a supermarket like I try to ruler I</p><p>try and find a few things I&rsquo;m trying to</p><p>you know I test take people shopping to</p><p>show them how to read stuff and how to</p><p>do stuff and you know this is a tough</p><p>one out there that&rsquo;s me I&rsquo;m a simple</p><p>kind of guy like I&rsquo;ll tell people if you</p><p>want really good success long-term is</p><p>stay simple find a few good things you</p><p>like and stay simple don&rsquo;t go to these</p><p>keto books sorry P no people and have</p><p>all these elaborate meals cuz you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna end up eating too much you don&rsquo;t</p><p>know your portion size and you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>eat too much yeah good point</p><p>very good point yeah I agree I&rsquo;ll keep</p><p>it simple I mean what I eat I mean I&rsquo;m</p><p>like I throw some salad in a bowl</p><p>I&rsquo;ll have today I&rsquo;ll be having a</p><p>hamburger and maybe it&rsquo;s some nuts</p><p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m doing so it&rsquo;s</p><p>like dr. burr once you create a video</p><p>I&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s too boring it&rsquo;s just you</p><p>so I&rsquo;m the exact same way I get that</p><p>from my family and my friends endow me</p><p>they just shake their head at me and</p><p>like I am worse</p><p>despite that I had ever been satisfied</p><p>with the meal I have and I&rsquo;m excited to</p><p>eat that meal there&rsquo;s no issue about</p><p>being bored anymore</p><p>now now I know it&rsquo;s a great way well</p><p>Stephen I really appreciate you doing</p><p>this follow-up because now people can</p><p>see that no you didn&rsquo;t gain the weight</p><p>back</p><p>you&rsquo;re continuously progress it is</p><p>working versus the Biggest Loser program</p><p>which you know that doesn&rsquo;t really work</p><p>well do another one a year later here</p><p>and how great it&rsquo;s gonna do you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m having more success this</p><p>last year I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this this last</p><p>year more than I&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed</p><p>anything because I&rsquo;ve been at a smaller</p><p>size my workouts again better I can I&rsquo;ll</p><p>tell people I can shop close on a</p><p>regular rack I can you know I can fit in</p><p>any seat I don&rsquo;t worry like you said at</p><p>the beginning I don&rsquo;t worry about a</p><p>booth I&rsquo;m like let&rsquo;s go sit let&rsquo;s get on</p><p>that plane see that&rsquo;s all fly economy</p><p>you know right so it&rsquo;s you know and I&rsquo;m</p><p>traveling a lot more you know</p><p>socializing more so the whole thing of</p><p>where I was three years ago almost dead</p><p>to where I am now and then the life</p><p>ahead of me that I have and especially</p><p>then I&rsquo;m at fasting yeah you know mrs.</p><p>Soto this is so huge well done Stephen</p><p>so thank thanks yeah thank you thank
