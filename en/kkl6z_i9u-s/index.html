the</p><p>original question and someone else asked</p><p>so um so she did</p><p>keto because there was a lot of body</p><p>problems there was inflammation in the</p><p>liver and there was um</p><p>a virus in the liver and and so she did</p><p>it and she did great and then</p><p>um</p><p>then she kind of like</p><p>went and did</p><p>went back to some of the other things</p><p>that she was eating um and then it came</p><p>back</p><p>so i just told her that</p><p>um</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re not out of the</p><p>woods yet especially when you get to</p><p>viruses of the liver</p><p>you know the question is some of these</p><p>viruses are really hard to</p><p>completely eliminate from the body</p><p>unless you get your body into some</p><p>hardcore autophagy autophagy is the</p><p>recycling of</p><p>old damaged proteins</p><p>when you do fasting</p><p>and you can also eliminate certain viral</p><p>or pathogens with autophagy but you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to do some you know</p><p>three or four days of fasting here and</p><p>there and and start to go that route but</p><p>in the meantime you want to go back to</p><p>the irregular</p><p>original keto plan that you started with</p><p>but you have to do it longer and just</p><p>stay on track unfortunately your body</p><p>just needs your body is telling you</p><p>don&rsquo;t go off the program</p><p>because there&rsquo;s so much benefit so and</p><p>then the best thing for the liver is the</p><p>milk thistle</p><p>that&rsquo;s the one that you want to</p><p>really um grow in your backyard it&rsquo;s</p><p>probably already growing there as a weed</p><p>it&rsquo;s all over the place and then you can</p><p>take it</p><p>dry it out make your own tinctures</p><p>that&rsquo;s the best getting it from the wild</p><p>so you know it&rsquo;s really good</p><p>i&rsquo;m going to be doing a video</p><p>today on stinging nettle root</p><p>which</p><p>i&rsquo;m going to be showing you i&rsquo;m growing</p><p>it it&rsquo;s</p><p>one of the most awesome</p><p>weeds</p><p>has no side effects but unbelievable for</p><p>arthritis pain gout rheumatoid osteo</p><p>i mean</p><p>and a lot of other things so i will be</p><p>talking about that but</p><p>um</p><p>now the original question was that uh</p><p>someone was consuming</p><p>um</p><p>the normal fat that&rsquo;s on the ketogenic</p><p>diet but that was irritating the</p><p>gallbladder because there&rsquo;s some stones</p><p>so</p><p>in that case</p><p>what you want to do is just consume the</p><p>fat that is normally in</p><p>protein it comes along with the protein</p><p>so don&rsquo;t try to go low fat but just</p><p>don&rsquo;t add fat and unfortunately the nuts</p><p>and peanut butter are very high in</p><p>omega-6 so that can irritate the bile</p><p>ducts</p><p>and then take some bile salts i</p><p>recommend the gallbladder formula but</p><p>you can take any any type</p><p>i am biased in my own products slightly</p><p>but</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>dairy is inflammatory for some people as</p><p>well</p><p>so that&rsquo;s something i would watch out</p><p>for but</p><p>the low carb diet the benefits</p><p>that&rsquo;s really what makes</p><p>keto keto it&rsquo;s low carb</p><p>it&rsquo;s not the high fat that makes a keto</p><p>so you can always adjust the fats</p><p>okay there you go so steve hopefully uh</p><p>people can hear me and um i know my</p><p>image is frozen but maybe it&rsquo;s maybe</p><p>it&rsquo;s not on on youtube i have no idea</p><p>youtube looks good i&rsquo;m watching it and</p><p>you&rsquo;re moving away in fact uh why don&rsquo;t</p><p>we try to catch up and here&rsquo;s our first</p><p>question and i guess you can&rsquo;t see it so</p><p>i&rsquo;ll read it for you which area of your</p><p>skin on your body has the most friendly</p><p>microbes so audience</p><p>dig into that</p><p>and uh yeah let me let me clarify that</p><p>for everyone so if you they&rsquo;ve done an</p><p>experiment on checking the microbial</p><p>life on the external part of your body</p><p>we know most of the microbes are in the</p><p>gut but also it&rsquo;s on the skin but what</p><p>part of your skin what what area of the</p><p>body has</p><p>a i mean a massive amount of microbes</p><p>compared to other parts that&rsquo;s the first</p><p>question</p><p>interesting question okay let&rsquo;s try to</p><p>go</p><p>uh now who are you speaking with it</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t latrice was it she was on with us</p><p>no it was uh</p><p>and uh there was another person it might</p><p>have been latrice okay and latrice was</p><p>starting and guess what we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>try to kick off that conversation again</p><p>so latrice uh asked dr berg your</p><p>original question</p><p>my question was just because um</p><p>i mean i&rsquo;ve done</p><p>intermittent fasting before but</p><p>i know that i was becoming insulin</p><p>resistant just by you know but i hadn&rsquo;t</p><p>been diagnosed full-blown being diabetic</p><p>because i&rsquo;ve kind of been you know on</p><p>and off i guess intermittent fasting but</p><p>i have some gallbladder issues and i</p><p>noticed that when i eat more fat it</p><p>irritates my gallbladder</p><p>and i was just trying to figure out if</p><p>whether or not um</p><p>like how how do i</p><p>incorporate the fat in my diet if it&rsquo;s</p><p>irritating my gallbladder because i have</p><p>two teeny tiny gall stones um that you</p><p>know wasn&rsquo;t worth removing my</p><p>gallbladder for uh right and that my</p><p>gallbladder looked healthy so you know</p><p>yeah</p><p>that that pain that discomfort that you</p><p>have</p><p>um if you really understand what&rsquo;s</p><p>happening is there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s um</p><p>probably not even in the gallbladder</p><p>itself it&rsquo;s in the bile ducts that the</p><p>tubes and so there&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>like probably backing up and putting</p><p>pressure because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s thicker</p><p>so um we have a combination of what the</p><p>bile that&rsquo;s going through there as well</p><p>as like the cholesterol so um the way to</p><p>solve this is to increase more bile and</p><p>things that</p><p>will act like bile like choline you</p><p>should be taking choline through the day</p><p>and bile salts with your meals on an</p><p>empty stomach to the point</p><p>where you&rsquo;re getting a nice flow like a</p><p>river that&rsquo;s flowing through those ducts</p><p>and so there&rsquo;s no more pain</p><p>you may need more than the average</p><p>person and then you just avoid the nuts</p><p>the peanut butter right now and</p><p>unfortunately the dairy</p><p>but</p><p>the saturated fat that comes in meat all</p><p>meats um</p><p>if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s in a moderate amount</p><p>should actually stimulates more</p><p>production of aisle it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going to worsen things</p><p>what will worsen things is if you add</p><p>like</p><p>uh coconut oil or</p><p>um</p><p>vegetable oils especially</p><p>fried foods because it&rsquo;s omega-6</p><p>but like fatty fish from salmon will not</p><p>aggravate the gallbladder at all</p><p>so</p><p>um yeah the omega-6 fatty acids will not</p><p>um</p><p>so it&rsquo;s really the omega uh</p><p>i&rsquo;m sorry the omega-3 won&rsquo;t omega-6 and</p><p>unfortunately like i&rsquo;ll give you an</p><p>example of omega-6 that&rsquo;s very</p><p>irritating the corn oil and they use</p><p>that in frying and all sorts of things</p><p>the soy oil it&rsquo;s in salad dressings</p><p>right and then we have the canola salad</p><p>dressings and pretty much every</p><p>restaurant that you go to is going to</p><p>have these omega-6 fatty acids that are</p><p>very inflammatory and then</p><p>the fat in chicken is more omega-6 too</p><p>but in</p><p>beef pork lamb</p><p>no there&rsquo;s a if you have them grass-fed</p><p>it&rsquo;s definitely it&rsquo;s a higher in omega-6</p><p>and then fish and seafood that should</p><p>not aggravate your your gallbladder</p><p>okay</p><p>eggs are good too</p><p>okay and i do notice that salmon does</p><p>aggregate baby is what is cooked with</p><p>so</p><p>yeah yes it really is yeah so just you</p><p>know have the salad the salmon and and</p><p>see if that bothers you and um</p><p>i think another thing that would be</p><p>really good for you is the apple cider</p><p>vinegar with the meal with i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>with in your water</p><p>with some betaine hydrochloride because</p><p>that&rsquo;ll acidify your stomach and you&rsquo;ll</p><p>just you&rsquo;ll just digest better</p><p>okay yep i do that already</p><p>oh awesome</p><p>awesome you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>sure</p><p>well that&rsquo;s great well thanks for your</p><p>patience latrice i&rsquo;m glad we got through</p><p>to you and dr berg as i was saying</p><p>before we got cut off the uh</p><p>social medias are live with questions</p><p>but there&rsquo;s also so many accolades and</p><p>great hearts and thumbs up for dr berg</p><p>and i thought i&rsquo;d read a few marty says</p><p>wish you were my doctor</p><p>even though i don&rsquo;t see mine and i think</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably a sentiment shared with</p><p>a lot of folks they just don&rsquo;t see a</p><p>reason to go there oftentimes they don&rsquo;t</p><p>really get a lot of attention and so on</p><p>to get more attention from you through</p><p>youtube etc and ekram says amazing wish</p><p>i could talk to you well folks you can</p><p>as you just saw that</p><p>latrice was on with dr berg fill out an</p><p>application go to dr berg.com and be</p><p>part of our live show every friday and</p><p>then finally anis along with so many</p><p>others loves you dr berg so you know you</p><p>got some friends out there</p><p>and let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go to</p><p>uh</p><p>our quiz question and the quiz question</p><p>asked</p><p>which area of your skin on your body has</p><p>the most friendly microbes and you gave</p><p>a little</p><p>example of that and from that 40 percent</p><p>of the respondents say the hands are</p><p>arms 20 say the feet</p><p>or soles of the feet 20 percent say the</p><p>scalp and 20 say the forehead or the</p><p>face any winners</p><p>yes it&rsquo;s actually the bottom of the foot</p><p>primarily the heel</p><p>the heel</p><p>has the most</p><p>microbes and i&rsquo;m talking about also</p><p>friendly fungus i&rsquo;m trying to educate</p><p>people on the</p><p>um</p><p>so they&rsquo;re not so germaphobic because</p><p>without these microbes</p><p>your skin becomes raw and red and</p><p>irritated so</p><p>don&rsquo;t try to sterilize your body so much</p><p>to the point where you kill off all</p><p>these microbes because they&rsquo;re helping</p><p>you they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re um there to defend</p><p>and protect</p><p>and uh they&rsquo;re part of your immune</p><p>system so um</p><p>you know i&rsquo;ll be releasing a video on</p><p>that topic very soon but</p><p>yeah these microbes are</p><p>are really amazing and they um</p><p>if you try to kill them they&rsquo;re not just</p><p>bad germs they&rsquo;re good germs if you</p><p>change the environment of your skin or</p><p>your body um the bad guys turn i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>the good guys turn into the bad guys so</p><p>they flip under stress</p><p>and they become pathogenic</p><p>and they create problems for us so um we</p><p>can&rsquo;t live without them</p><p>they digest all of our fiber that we</p><p>can&rsquo;t digest so we appreciate that we</p><p>provide a home and they give us b</p><p>vitamins and other other type of</p><p>protection</p><p>it&rsquo;s called a symbiotic relationship um</p><p>you know you have to</p><p>live with</p><p>these other microbes right</p><p>or else</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t tolerate them then you&rsquo;ll</p><p>have problems absolutely well you know</p><p>as a child of the 50s and 60s none of us</p><p>had shoes on in the summer and we were</p><p>tromping over everything and polio was a</p><p>rich person&rsquo;s disease all the kids on</p><p>the street with dirt on their face and</p><p>dirt on their heels uh seemed to survive</p><p>it but the rockefellers and so on and</p><p>our own uh president roosevelt had uh</p><p>polio so uh there&rsquo;s a lot of good uh</p><p>junk in uh</p><p>junk</p><p>so keep applying it as dr berg said all</p><p>right why don&rsquo;t we try to catch up here</p><p>and let&rsquo;s go to the next question dr</p><p>berg you&rsquo;re probably looking at the old</p><p>feed that stopped can you see yourself</p><p>or see this question yet if not i&rsquo;ll</p><p>read it for you</p><p>uh why don&rsquo;t you read it for me steve</p><p>very good okay which area oh i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>all right what is the average daily</p><p>sitting time for a person in the u.s how</p><p>long do we stay on our keisters</p><p>and yeah so so uh obviously obviously</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s sitting down right now well</p><p>take a wild guess</p><p>uh of</p><p>how much time we an average person sits</p><p>okay so let&rsquo;s see what you guys have to</p><p>say about that</p><p>all right terrific and a slightly</p><p>truncated list but here&rsquo;s the folks that</p><p>are now watching us and they&rsquo;re joining</p><p>us from the uk canada poland russia</p><p>belgium france india pakistan mexico</p><p>denmark algeria trinidad egypt germany</p><p>the netherlands chile the czech republic</p><p>saudi arabia norway nigeria and i&rsquo;m sure</p><p>many more and of course all across these</p><p>united states so thank you so much and</p><p>we see you on social media and we are</p><p>trying to um keep up with that let&rsquo;s see</p><p>steve from facebook uh no association i</p><p>have been intermittent fasting since the</p><p>first of the year i&rsquo;m 70 and feel super</p><p>just need to lose that last 10 pounds</p><p>how can you get there dog</p><p>it&rsquo;s always the hardest because your</p><p>body um</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t like</p><p>it&rsquo;s counterintuitive it likes to</p><p>survive and and getting rid of something</p><p>is not survival your body likes to</p><p>retain fat because it&rsquo;s a survival</p><p>mechanism right so you&rsquo;re going to have</p><p>to bend the</p><p>bend the physical universe by doing</p><p>either longer fasting</p><p>or cutting your carbs lower and lower</p><p>and lower or adding a lot more exercise</p><p>because that last bit is like just think</p><p>of it like</p><p>your body&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of</p><p>something that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re trying to help</p><p>your body</p><p>so you&rsquo;re going to have to do things</p><p>that are even more extreme</p><p>to take that last</p><p>few pounds off unfortunately i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>um that&rsquo;s what you have to do so</p><p>well that&rsquo;s true there you go</p><p>okay fg from youtube uh can you offer</p><p>any guidance for oh got protein ura and</p><p>kidney</p><p>disease protein urine yeah kidney</p><p>disease and your protein the urine um</p><p>what you have to do is</p><p>believe it or not there&rsquo;s some</p><p>there&rsquo;s some great data on</p><p>on fasting but</p><p>you know here&rsquo;s the problem i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what stage you&rsquo;re at if you&rsquo;re stage</p><p>five and you&rsquo;re on kidney dialysis</p><p>that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p><p>that you&rsquo;re going to have to really</p><p>consult your doctor on that but i will</p><p>say that there&rsquo;s some</p><p>fascinating data it&rsquo;s been</p><p>you know there&rsquo;s been this idea that you</p><p>can&rsquo;t you like potassium is toxic to the</p><p>kidneys and so stay away from potassium</p><p>but</p><p>and then it was like well if you have</p><p>stage five cancer</p><p>kidney disease you can&rsquo;t have potassium</p><p>and now they&rsquo;re saying</p><p>um even if you do have advanced kidney</p><p>potassium is protective if it&rsquo;s from</p><p>food so i would really try to get your</p><p>nutrition from food</p><p>because think about what&rsquo;s happening if</p><p>you have protein in the urine that means</p><p>that your body is</p><p>not reabsorbing this protein and</p><p>recycling the protein so now</p><p>there&rsquo;s like holes in the bucket it&rsquo;s</p><p>just going through</p><p>and so it&rsquo;s showing up in</p><p>the blood because the blood</p><p>the kidneys are filters of your blood</p><p>so um</p><p>again it&rsquo;s going back to the healthiest</p><p>version of keto you can do with the help</p><p>of your doctor to make sure that you&rsquo;re</p><p>not eating too much of certain things</p><p>but um you know you can&rsquo;t get away if</p><p>you have bad kitties you can&rsquo;t get away</p><p>with just regular foods you can&rsquo;t get</p><p>away with uh uh foods that are just</p><p>conventional you have to do</p><p>organic</p><p>uh you know</p><p>stuff that you raise in your own garden</p><p>because you got to step it way way up</p><p>you can&rsquo;t afford to go off the program</p><p>you have to be very very strict and i</p><p>think that&rsquo;s the way to pull out of this</p><p>and i&rsquo;m going to tell you quickly this</p><p>this guy who was a patient came to see</p><p>me</p><p>he&rsquo;s a</p><p>veterinarian and</p><p>he was on kidney dialysis and he came to</p><p>my office for three days for some help</p><p>and</p><p>we got him on the right program</p><p>and it was a little bit dangerous and</p><p>risky for him to come out like that</p><p>because</p><p>he was kind of doing this in between his</p><p>sessions well anyway to make a long</p><p>story short</p><p>he got really really strict he did very</p><p>well</p><p>and uh guess what he survived</p><p>to the point where his doctor did not</p><p>even continue to recommend</p><p>the um</p><p>um the</p><p>the procedure where you actually are the</p><p>kidney dialysis anymore so</p><p>that was like a miracle and uh it just</p><p>tells us that</p><p>if your diet is good</p><p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of things that can</p><p>happen that can go beyond just</p><p>the traditional medical care and and the</p><p>doctor didn&rsquo;t have any experience in</p><p>that but he was shocked to find out that</p><p>wow we don&rsquo;t need to do that anymore</p><p>so it&rsquo;s a combination of super healthy</p><p>keto with</p><p>really good fasting</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s fantastic well speaking of</p><p>microbiomes i&rsquo;m not sure if this is</p><p>janet from youtube my partner has a bad</p><p>yeast infection on his body it&rsquo;s</p><p>incredibly itchy what do you suggest</p><p>they do now i suggest a new partner doc</p><p>do you have any other recommendations</p><p>for janet um yeast yeast</p><p>lives in fungus and candida</p><p>live on sugar</p><p>so i would dramatically reduce your</p><p>sugar</p><p>and i would also get um</p><p>my liquid</p><p>probiotic</p><p>and take a little bit and dilute it</p><p>maybe by just put a teaspoon in water</p><p>and dilute it and put that on your skin</p><p>because that way you can actually put</p><p>this friendly microbe</p><p>on</p><p>on the body you see the the bacteria in</p><p>your body curb or keep in check</p><p>the fungus and yeast this is why when</p><p>you go on a</p><p>you know like some antibiotics you end</p><p>up with a yeast infection because you</p><p>kill off your bacteria antibiotics don&rsquo;t</p><p>kill yeast fungus</p><p>mold</p><p>and</p><p>candida they don&rsquo;t kill that so you just</p><p>wipe off you wipe up the bacteria and</p><p>then you get these overgrowths and</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re eating sugar so you</p><p>you really want to cut out all the sugar</p><p>if you want to kill off yeast or candida</p><p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific and by the way</p><p>for our global audience we are going to</p><p>stay on the air for at least an extra 15</p><p>minutes to make up for our beginning</p><p>shortfall so we&rsquo;re going to get to your</p><p>questions we&rsquo;re going to get to</p><p>everybody in the green room we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to get all the quizzes and that&rsquo;s and</p><p>and so on so speaking of quizzes</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s get the next one here</p><p>oh yes</p><p>what is the average daily sitting time</p><p>for a person in the u.s sixty percent uh</p><p>say eight to ten hours</p><p>thirty percent say 11 to 15 hours</p><p>and 10 say more than 15 hours</p><p>are they under something doc okay</p><p>the answer is between 12 and 15 hours</p><p>that&rsquo;s incredible that blew me away</p><p>that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s the majority</p><p>of the day</p><p>it&rsquo;s amazing you know and i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m guilty</p><p>um you know i didn&rsquo;t even realize how</p><p>many hours i spent</p><p>sitting</p><p>and so what happens that tends to</p><p>shorten your</p><p>your uh your thigh muscles your quad</p><p>muscles</p><p>and your flexors basically uh on the</p><p>body internally and and then that kind</p><p>of throws off your um</p><p>your back so your back is constantly in</p><p>a protective spasm tightness and it&rsquo;s</p><p>underneath a lot of back pain which</p><p>actually is my video today so the</p><p>sitting is a killer and that is um</p><p>if you sit a lot what you need to do is</p><p>probably set your alarm</p><p>every</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know every few hours to get up</p><p>and stretch and stretch your thigh</p><p>muscle out so if you go to my</p><p>youtube channel when we&rsquo;re done here and</p><p>i show you the best stress for that that</p><p>would be good but</p><p>um yeah you have to counter it because</p><p>unfortunately you know we have to sit um</p><p>and then at night when we&rsquo;re sitting</p><p>again and during the day you might sit</p><p>so we pretty much spend way too much</p><p>time sitting so um</p><p>you have to</p><p>counter that that problem</p><p>well i&rsquo;m countering it with nutritional</p><p>yeast a constant stream of those are</p><p>going into my mouth uh but not so fun is</p><p>divesh from youtube his mom has stage</p><p>four cancer</p><p>uh please share some advice on what she</p><p>can do i assume of course he&rsquo;s talking</p><p>about diet</p><p>watch my video i watch my all my videos</p><p>on cancer</p><p>uh i talk i give some great advice and</p><p>then um of course i&rsquo;m not going to make</p><p>any claims</p><p>but these are just things that you</p><p>should be educated in there was a</p><p>gentleman</p><p>a success story he was stage four</p><p>terminal they sent him home to go home</p><p>and die and guess what he&rsquo;s still living</p><p>and guess what he doesn&rsquo;t have cancer in</p><p>his body anymore he started his own</p><p>youtube channel and you should watch it</p><p>and you&rsquo;ll see his link if you watch all</p><p>my my videos but</p><p>um there&rsquo;s a lot to be said about cancer</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of protocols right now</p><p>some of you have helped</p><p>fund some cancer research that we&rsquo;re</p><p>doing</p><p>in europe right now</p><p>and uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the reason why it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>short study is because we wanted to do</p><p>it long enough to see how long these</p><p>mice survive with this protocol which is</p><p>a great</p><p>amazing</p><p>um</p><p>protocol based on a brilliant</p><p>uh</p><p>scientist in</p><p>in france uh in his data that he&rsquo;s not</p><p>just an md but he&rsquo;s a has his phd in</p><p>biochemistry and he</p><p>he&rsquo;s an older gentleman that doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>do that anymore but he gave us</p><p>some amazing data that i&rsquo;ve shared on</p><p>other youtube channels of</p><p>of a protocol</p><p>of a new strategy that literally causes</p><p>the cancer cell</p><p>to not be able to reproduce their their</p><p>membranes</p><p>and so</p><p>unfortunately the diet for um</p><p>once you have cancer is going to be</p><p>different than the diet that you would</p><p>consume to prevent cancer</p><p>all of you that don&rsquo;t have cancer that</p><p>are watching</p><p>should be right now</p><p>on the diet that prevents cancer you</p><p>should actively and aggressively do that</p><p>and that just happens to be the healthy</p><p>version of the ketogenic diet with</p><p>in a minute fasting</p><p>interesting well here&rsquo;s a little side</p><p>note april from youtube dr berg my dog</p><p>is barking because he hears your dog</p><p>barking so charlie is sending them all</p><p>sorry about that i</p><p>unfortunately there&rsquo;s nothing i can do</p><p>about that oh well that&rsquo;s not a</p><p>criticism we know he&rsquo;s out there chasing</p><p>ponies and having fun so that adds a</p><p>little bit of farm flavor to the whole</p><p>thing</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see where are we now so uh</p><p>chanel from youtube thanks dr burb my</p><p>fibroids shrunk because of your videos</p><p>thank you from india</p><p>so that&rsquo;s great oh i hate those fibroids</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome that is awesome</p><p>i have videos on on fibroids if anyone</p><p>wants to get more information</p><p>well that is fantastic and so is our</p><p>next question so which country has the</p><p>lowest rates of breast cancer and why is</p><p>that which country has the lowest rates</p><p>of breast cancer and</p><p>why is our next question audience and</p><p>let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t go back to our</p><p>green room and vivian from stormy</p><p>amsterdam</p><p>is has a question for you and vivian</p><p>unmute yourself and you&rsquo;re on with dr</p><p>bird</p><p>i think i i did answer that if i&rsquo;m not</p><p>mistaken you correct me well we have two</p><p>vivian&rsquo;s one from virginia vivian did we</p><p>answer your question</p><p>right i did answer both of them before</p><p>i&rsquo;m not sure</p><p>okay you know what probably not on the</p><p>air do you want to uh recap uh vivian&rsquo;s</p><p>question</p><p>uh for vivian</p><p>that was the person with the with the</p><p>liver</p><p>um that had liver enzymes and uh</p><p>um</p><p>you know she was doing great and then</p><p>she kind of went off the main program</p><p>and then we just told her get back on</p><p>the main program just because it takes</p><p>time to especially if liver liver&rsquo;s</p><p>involved it does take about</p><p>three years of consistency um so it&rsquo;s</p><p>all about this</p><p>you know that&rsquo;s been the hardest thing</p><p>for people is to stay consistent uh</p><p>especially even with exercise so um i</p><p>think</p><p>if you learn from my mistake it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you know to the point where</p><p>if i go off this program i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p><p>survive very well so i like to survive</p><p>so um i made it</p><p>doable</p><p>and um</p><p>you know so just follow some of the</p><p>advice that i give you and you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll</p><p>you&rsquo;ll do fine</p><p>absolutely let me see</p><p>here doc oh uh why don&rsquo;t we go to one i</p><p>don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve talked to and that is</p><p>usman and he&rsquo;s from birmingham uk</p><p>england and i&rsquo;ve been today</p><p>oh</p><p>i&rsquo;ve said my name oh you did well</p><p>uh yeah</p><p>oh okay well why don&rsquo;t you vivian would</p><p>you</p><p>kick it off for us</p><p>i have a few very very short</p><p>questions um about the omad do i need to</p><p>eat every day at the same time</p><p>or can it also be</p><p>one time i i have a few hours earlier</p><p>you know that&rsquo;s a really good question i</p><p>think um</p><p>you want to mimic</p><p>what our bodies were designed to do</p><p>so</p><p>way back</p><p>in the day</p><p>um we didn&rsquo;t eat</p><p>at a regular time did we we ate when</p><p>there&rsquo;s food so if you could mimic that</p><p>eat whenever you feel like you need to</p><p>eat that and stagger it that would be</p><p>actually better than actually having a</p><p>consistent time</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing omad one meal</p><p>a day</p><p>i think</p><p>you&rsquo;d be more flexible with that um</p><p>yeah because the body gets used to it</p><p>and uh</p><p>it would actually help help things</p><p>can i do this</p><p>how long do you do omad you do that for</p><p>just as long as you want to be healthy</p><p>and then you can go back to</p><p>eating six meals a day</p><p>okay and and the key to an uh</p><p>intermitting fasting is that for life</p><p>oh yeah you could say that yeah might be</p><p>good for life feels long again as long</p><p>as you want to be healthy um okay</p><p>yeah</p><p>and there&rsquo;s another thing i take one</p><p>glucosamine tablet a day</p><p>on advice of my</p><p>chinese</p><p>doctor</p><p>for my joints</p><p>does it harm the keto in the ear no no</p><p>none of these herbs</p><p>are</p><p>are that harmful now</p><p>that&rsquo;s a really good one and uh yeah not</p><p>a problem at all um you can continue to</p><p>take those um</p><p>yeah because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re from nature</p><p>so</p><p>i wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it</p><p>okay and can i drink black coffee with</p><p>almond milk</p><p>yes you can</p><p>preferably organic preferably organic</p><p>but yes you can</p><p>okay and then</p><p>one more question</p><p>i eat white cheeses</p><p>okay but i thought um that when you are</p><p>in keto that you were not supposed to</p><p>use</p><p>dairy because it&rsquo;s from the cow</p><p>so it&rsquo;s</p><p>me well keto is low carb right</p><p>keto is low carb so you don&rsquo;t want to do</p><p>milk but</p><p>when you turn milk into cheese</p><p>guess what the microbes in the cheese</p><p>eat up all the carbs</p><p>so it&rsquo;s higher in protein it&rsquo;s very low</p><p>in carbs so cheese is low carb</p><p>yeah</p><p>okay yeah i know</p><p>okay so there&rsquo;s no no harm and there&rsquo;s</p><p>another question i have two things i</p><p>have a very dry skin</p><p>and it looks like my my face is like a</p><p>dry out apple so i i drink enough so i</p><p>don&rsquo;t know what i&rsquo;m doing wrong</p><p>well i think</p><p>and thank you again for your one</p><p>question but i think what you should do</p><p>is you should probably um</p><p>work on your fats to make sure you have</p><p>enough</p><p>fats but it&rsquo;s not just about fat it&rsquo;s</p><p>about the digestion of fat through the</p><p>gallbladder if there&rsquo;s not enough bile</p><p>bile in your gallbladder then what</p><p>happens is that your skin gets dried out</p><p>and so</p><p>if you go back to</p><p>like that when i talk about my book</p><p>compare what you&rsquo;re eating to what&rsquo;s in</p><p>my book and see what you&rsquo;re missing um</p><p>it&rsquo;s probably not liquid it&rsquo;s probably</p><p>more of the the healthy fats that you&rsquo;re</p><p>missing</p><p>uh and even like the omega-3 fatty acids</p><p>and i talk about them in my book a lot</p><p>so also search out my uh video on dry</p><p>skin because uh you&rsquo;ll get more</p><p>information on that too</p><p>well all right thank you so much vivian</p><p>thank you vivian and i</p><p>i don&rsquo;t believe it she does not look</p><p>like a dried out apple she looks</p><p>terrific from amsterdam to great weather</p><p>and so on so we have an answer to our</p><p>third question of the day and the</p><p>question asked which country has the</p><p>lowest rates of breast cancer and why is</p><p>that</p><p>well the audience thought that 35 of</p><p>them say africa 25 say italy in other</p><p>parts of europe 20 say india and 10 say</p><p>japan i&rsquo;m sticking with japan</p><p>you know japan is uh at the top of the</p><p>list and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s i mean it&rsquo;s close</p><p>with some of these other countries too</p><p>but japan is the highest but did they</p><p>tell you why steve</p><p>well uh i know i it&rsquo;s diet related they</p><p>did not but i think it&rsquo;s diet related</p><p>i think you&rsquo;re right on that um one</p><p>thing the japanese consume</p><p>these especially women is uh higher</p><p>amounts of</p><p>iodine okay</p><p>in this seek help</p><p>because they have a lot of seaweed and</p><p>um</p><p>and uh in their diet in fact</p><p>you know um the rdas</p><p>for</p><p>iodine is like 145 micrograms in a you</p><p>know in the</p><p>u.s they consume 100 times that</p><p>and guess what</p><p>iodine is a wonderful protector against</p><p>excessive amounts of</p><p>estrogen that is harmful and can cause</p><p>breast cancer and ovarian cancer and</p><p>uterus cancer</p><p>so um</p><p>there when you eat consume more</p><p>diet related iodine you&rsquo;re more</p><p>protected against</p><p>uh the overdose of estrogen and even</p><p>cancer so um</p><p>how do you get that you know well guess</p><p>what you can do the seaweed which i know</p><p>a lot of you just love seaweed or you</p><p>can do the shellfish or</p><p>fish</p><p>i i think that&rsquo;s probably the thing that</p><p>you can focus on is ocean fish that</p><p>gives you a lot more iodine and there&rsquo;s</p><p>some iodine and maybe some eggs and even</p><p>dairy but the problem is</p><p>the soils are so depleted unless you</p><p>consume food that is</p><p>close to the shoreline of an ocean</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to get it so um</p><p>again</p><p>make mental note of this i&rsquo;m going to</p><p>release a video very soon</p><p>on how to do a home test</p><p>take you a few</p><p>well take about an hour to figure out if</p><p>you&rsquo;re deficient in iodine and if you</p><p>are</p><p>guess what you need to start consuming</p><p>more fish</p><p>or start to consume more</p><p>seek help</p><p>interesting okay victor from youtube has</p><p>been doing intermittent fasting 16-8 as</p><p>well as the keto diet now i find i have</p><p>to fast longer to see results does the</p><p>body build resistance to ketogenesis</p><p>um</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just like anything</p><p>else</p><p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say resistance against it but</p><p>it gets used to it and that last</p><p>that last bit of weight definitely takes</p><p>a lot more work to come off but um</p><p>um i think it&rsquo;s uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s important to</p><p>um stay consistent and let your body go</p><p>through whatever it needs to go compared</p><p>to what a lot some people do not a lot</p><p>of people but</p><p>they they then have this idea that they</p><p>need to do carb cycling because you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do keto forever whatever</p><p>so they start doing cycling so they have</p><p>these</p><p>once a week you just carb day and they</p><p>carve out</p><p>but there&rsquo;s been some studies on that</p><p>that show that that&rsquo;s not beneficial it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t help you to</p><p>carve out you&rsquo;ve been doing carb out</p><p>your whole life and so adding more</p><p>carbs just</p><p>brings you backwards it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>um</p><p>is it okay to do occasional poisons well</p><p>no it doesn&rsquo;t help the body</p><p>but</p><p>all that sugar refined carbs does you no</p><p>good it&rsquo;s not beneficial</p><p>all right keep that in mind on to our</p><p>next question which mineral is behind</p><p>the feeling of weakness while fasting</p><p>boy we don&rsquo;t want to take that one</p><p>does the audience know what it is i&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry what mineral deficiency is behind</p><p>the weakness when you do fasting ah okay</p><p>when you feel weak when you&rsquo;re fasting</p><p>there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s missing</p><p>that you&rsquo;re deficient in that i want to</p><p>see if you guys know what that one thing</p><p>is</p><p>okay it&rsquo;s not a mineral causing it but</p><p>the lack of a mineral causing it so</p><p>that&rsquo;s a lack of a mineral that&rsquo;s what</p><p>we are looking for and let&rsquo;s see what</p><p>else do we have here okay and this is an</p><p>oft-asked question george from youtube</p><p>can i eat nuts on keto and what if if so</p><p>what are the best</p><p>yes you can but again if you too much</p><p>you can irritate your gallbladder</p><p>i think the the best nut</p><p>is the um you know of course make sure</p><p>you do organic because they really they</p><p>douse these with</p><p>you know pesticides especially peanuts</p><p>because it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not an actual nut</p><p>it&rsquo;s a legume and it&rsquo;s in this soft</p><p>shell underneath the in the soil so you</p><p>can imagine just soaks up all these</p><p>pesticides um so one of the best nuts</p><p>that i recommend</p><p>uh is the walnut because the omega-3 but</p><p>then the um i like the pecans</p><p>i love pecans</p><p>and because it&rsquo;s fatty and it&rsquo;s really</p><p>um</p><p>it&rsquo;s a good ratio of fat to protein</p><p>so i would go with the walnut</p><p>and the pecan</p><p>and there&rsquo;s other nuts too but the</p><p>problem with the</p><p>almonds is that they&rsquo;re they are high in</p><p>oxalate so if you&rsquo;re prone to kidney</p><p>stones or arthritis</p><p>that might not be a good choice</p><p>pistachios are also good as well</p><p>but</p><p>here&rsquo;s the other thing too i mean it&rsquo;s a</p><p>pain in the butt to germinate these nuts</p><p>and seeds but to soak them in water</p><p>overnight and then to put them in a</p><p>dehydrator would be the ultimate thing</p><p>you could do because you&rsquo;ll find the</p><p>digestibility goes up and boy the taste</p><p>goes up so</p><p>um</p><p>that just that&rsquo;s just some extra stuff</p><p>that if you</p><p>have the time to do it go for it all</p><p>right that&rsquo;s terrific and we had the</p><p>lovely linda w on our cue but she fell</p><p>off somehow but thanks to our message</p><p>board we got a question and she wants to</p><p>know what&rsquo;s a good regimen for digestion</p><p>if you well we just talked about</p><p>gallbladder but if you don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>gallbladder</p><p>that was her second question so</p><p>yeah if you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p><p>then you&rsquo;re good to go so then you don&rsquo;t</p><p>worry about that problem now you really</p><p>need the gallbladder and the gallbladder</p><p>is like this organ that is a little</p><p>pouch and that stores and concentrates</p><p>bile so if you don&rsquo;t have it that means</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be lacking the the</p><p>concentration bile to</p><p>to be able to help you</p><p>extract some of these fat soluble</p><p>vitamins vitamin a e d e and k</p><p>and omega 3 fatty acids so</p><p>the diet you should be in now is a diet</p><p>that</p><p>has some additional um help</p><p>like purify bile salts i recommend</p><p>gallbladder my gallbladder formula and</p><p>yes i am totally biased on that 100</p><p>um</p><p>but</p><p>also</p><p>taking more</p><p>of these</p><p>nutrients maybe in a supplement form the</p><p>vitamin d3 right k2 the vitamin e</p><p>um so you have to take more so it can be</p><p>digested</p><p>um because</p><p>you may show over time a deficiency</p><p>like</p><p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in vitamin a you&rsquo;ll</p><p>notice like at night your your vision is</p><p>is worse and worse and worse</p><p>um with the vitamin e it could be</p><p>showing up in the heart as chest pain or</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing rock climbing high</p><p>altitude</p><p>out of oxygen because vitamin d gives</p><p>you more oxygen it&rsquo;s a real powerful</p><p>um</p><p>support especially to the muscle</p><p>of the heart</p><p>also</p><p>vitamin um</p><p>let&rsquo;s see</p><p>k2 you may be building up calcification</p><p>in the arteries or the joints as</p><p>arthritis and then if you&rsquo;re lacking k1</p><p>you may have a problem with excessive</p><p>amount of bruising</p><p>or you bleed easily</p><p>so these are all just like indicators</p><p>that you know you need more support with</p><p>the bile cells and omega-3 if you&rsquo;re</p><p>deficient in that you might get achy</p><p>joints and arthritis</p><p>all right well i think i know the answer</p><p>to this but latrice in richmond</p><p>is juicing and she wants to know if she</p><p>can do that while on uh intermittent</p><p>fasting and keto worried about the sugar</p><p>i think she probably should be</p><p>from fruits especially if you do</p><p>anything like carrot juice apple juice</p><p>beet juice if you&rsquo;re gonna do juicing um</p><p>on</p><p>keto</p><p>make it like like vegetable like</p><p>juice you know kale</p><p>celery</p><p>greens</p><p>but don&rsquo;t add anything to sweeten it</p><p>i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>yeah sorry you put that to bed christina</p><p>from youtube i fought utis all my life</p><p>and i still get them at 60.</p><p>i only have half of a thyroid and i take</p><p>meds for that i have arthritis and my</p><p>urine is always cloudy help</p><p>you need to go right to the basics and</p><p>really compare what you&rsquo;re doing to what</p><p>you should be doing based on my book</p><p>okay</p><p>and then you&rsquo;ll find out what you need</p><p>to do but</p><p>after you start doing healthy keto</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to find that your kidneys</p><p>are going to be cleaner i mean the</p><p>filtering is going to be cleaner your</p><p>urine is going to be better just tells</p><p>me that your diet isn&rsquo;t correct now i</p><p>can tell you a certain remedy to take</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p><p>but unless you get the basic eating</p><p>corrected</p><p>it&rsquo;s kind of like expensive urine just</p><p>kind of goes right through you so</p><p>i&rsquo;m opposed</p><p>people taking</p><p>vitamins or nutrition if they&rsquo;re not</p><p>correcting</p><p>their basic diet that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s something that i would highly</p><p>recommend that you consider at least</p><p>trying</p><p>once in a blue</p><p>all right dr berg just hit the cough</p><p>button on behalf of charlotte i</p><p>basically had to quickly pause because</p><p>this</p><p>dog outside um</p><p>is sparking but now</p><p>he&rsquo;s chilled out well we&rsquo;re all charmed</p><p>by him and we have answers to quiz</p><p>question number four which asks which</p><p>mineral or lack of mineral is behind the</p><p>feeling of weakness while fasting</p><p>and</p><p>55 said magnesium 40 say potassium and a</p><p>measly 5 say</p><p>selenium okay it&rsquo;s sodium</p><p>sodium</p><p>salt</p><p>salt salt sea salt that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m going</p><p>to recommend if you feel weak</p><p>when you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>either keto and especially fasting</p><p>intermittent fasting</p><p>take more salt and your energy will come</p><p>straight up and vertical and i&rsquo;m not</p><p>talking about energy i&rsquo;m sorry your</p><p>strength</p><p>your you&rsquo;ll feel stronger you will feel</p><p>less weak</p><p>um</p><p>so make mental note of that steve okay</p><p>and we should make middle note of this</p><p>kamenzi from youtube and many others</p><p>according to terry love your beard makes</p><p>you look sexy so there you have it</p><p>karen just said i heard that</p><p>well i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a question</p><p>you need to answer well karen i tell you</p><p>got nothing to worry about</p><p>uh because you&rsquo;re absolutely gorgeous</p><p>now let&rsquo;s see bulky xenia i can&rsquo;t</p><p>believe that&rsquo;s their name from youtube</p><p>can i have hibiscus tea while fasting</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s a really good one uh it&rsquo;s a</p><p>it has antimicrobial properties</p><p>antioxidant properties anti and</p><p>anti-inflammatory properties so yeah</p><p>that</p><p>that would be a great tea any of the</p><p>herbal teas are really good um but just</p><p>watch the ones with caffeine get the</p><p>ones that are naturally decaffeinated</p><p>herbal teas it can help you fast and it</p><p>can give you phytonutrients that uh can</p><p>help you speed up autophagy and increase</p><p>autophagy which is the recycling of</p><p>you know</p><p>old proteins</p><p>so yeah for sure</p><p>all right well that&rsquo;s great and you know</p><p>i had the pleasure of going to</p><p>birmingham england once gorgeous town</p><p>and that&rsquo;s where our next uh participant</p><p>in the green room is coming from and</p><p>usman</p><p>from birmingham is on with dr berg and</p><p>go ahead with your one question usman</p><p>hi guys can you hear me</p><p>yes perfectly yeah perfect so dr berg my</p><p>question would be in regards to</p><p>intermittent fasting and omad</p><p>so when would a person uh following this</p><p>diet</p><p>like i am start to realize that it&rsquo;s</p><p>starting to plateau and kind of like</p><p>not be as effective</p><p>so usually um</p><p>i will lose a lot of weight at the start</p><p>and then it goes slow so i just want to</p><p>know um</p><p>what are the signs for this and</p><p>um what could i do to overcome this</p><p>like a like a plateau type thing is that</p><p>what you&rsquo;re saying yes so you know</p><p>it starts a little bit slower than usual</p><p>yeah yeah okay um i whatever you know at</p><p>first when you do this um you really you</p><p>will lose a lot of water weight and</p><p>sometimes you lose fat uh and then you</p><p>might you might ebb and flow get better</p><p>and worse better or more proven less</p><p>improvement over time</p><p>but the fact the indicators to look at</p><p>um</p><p>are not necessarily weight loss</p><p>it would be more of um</p><p>the most important indicator would be a</p><p>lack of appetite so if you if your</p><p>appetite is gone and it&rsquo;s like really</p><p>going away and you have no cravings</p><p>especially</p><p>that means you are on track it&rsquo;s working</p><p>fine and when you do omad</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing a good amount of fasting</p><p>and so that means the amount of ketones</p><p>that you&rsquo;re going to generate</p><p>are going to be like at least three</p><p>times more than if you just eat a</p><p>ketogenic diet</p><p>so that&rsquo;s good so you&rsquo;re going more into</p><p>deep</p><p>ketosis and you&rsquo;re getting the benefits</p><p>and i want to talk about the benefits</p><p>you know you have some weight loss and</p><p>then</p><p>brain regeneration and healing</p><p>protein</p><p>repair</p><p>like your muscles start going from</p><p>atrophy to building</p><p>better mood so your mood goes up</p><p>so you become</p><p>more</p><p>happy you&rsquo;re less depressed less anxiety</p><p>and so we have brain improvements we</p><p>have immune improvements we have weight</p><p>loss improvements um</p><p>more energy so so you want to look at</p><p>all these factors to know</p><p>you know if you just go by weight loss</p><p>and you just stop losing weight you may</p><p>think it&rsquo;s not working but your body</p><p>has to get healthy</p><p>first before it starts losing weight</p><p>so</p><p>okay</p><p>how can we speed it up</p><p>um well we&rsquo;re just going to</p><p>now we&rsquo;re going to do something a little</p><p>more radical and now it&rsquo;s like okay</p><p>let&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m gonna do a</p><p>a two day fast</p><p>all right next week i&rsquo;m gonna try a</p><p>three day fast and you start doing it</p><p>like that and that&rsquo;s when you really</p><p>start kicking in high gear and getting</p><p>even better results you can also look at</p><p>what you eat on that meal is it is the</p><p>carbs low enough</p><p>we can also add some exercise we can</p><p>also try to reduce the stress by</p><p>spending more time outside in nature</p><p>things like that</p><p>you can also try to</p><p>get an extra hour of sleep these are all</p><p>just things that you can speed it up but</p><p>i think the thing that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>probably</p><p>work the best and produce the biggest</p><p>benefit which is</p><p>might be the hardest is to do the</p><p>periodic prolonged fasts</p><p>48 hours or 72 hours</p><p>but that can give you some really good</p><p>benefits</p><p>just uh lastly um for example if i was</p><p>to get to my ideal weight</p><p>would it be sensible than to go to two</p><p>meals or just stick to one meal a day</p><p>for</p><p>a long time but those two years would be</p><p>healthy it wouldn&rsquo;t be um unhealthy</p><p>meals</p><p>good question and i know in england they</p><p>probably don&rsquo;t use a lot of sugar in the</p><p>in the diet in the food so you&rsquo;re safe</p><p>on that</p><p>and again that was more dry sense of</p><p>humor but i would</p><p>i would play it by ear and you hit your</p><p>ideal weight</p><p>and then just play it by ear see what</p><p>happens when you do two males how do you</p><p>feel does the weight come back can you</p><p>maintain it</p><p>um</p><p>i think i would just</p><p>cross that bridge when you get there</p><p>because you have flexibility and</p><p>um</p><p>yeah i would i would just play it by ear</p><p>you can probably</p><p>you know go to two meals and see how</p><p>that i see how you do or add more fat to</p><p>that big meal once one meal a day</p><p>yeah</p><p>thank you dr burke sure no problem</p><p>gusman thank you and yes uh indeed in</p><p>england they call french fries chips and</p><p>they got chips on every corner</p><p>uh</p><p>i&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re fried in some</p><p>really healthy oils as well so i think</p><p>we&rsquo;re good on that that&rsquo;s right</p><p>absolutely</p><p>so anyway usman thank you so much and uh</p><p>you know it sounds like you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>survive all this</p><p>so let&rsquo;s see what do we have here hedy</p><p>from youtube</p><p>which of your products couch i&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>folks i just dropped that right on my</p><p>keyboard how did that sound doc</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see hedy from youtube which of</p><p>your products would help with sickle</p><p>cell anemia could you please do a video</p><p>on how to address sickle cell anemia</p><p>well i think i would take um um</p><p>the best i will do a video on that but i</p><p>think the best thing is something to</p><p>support your blood and the best blood</p><p>support product i have would be the</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder that&rsquo;s because</p><p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s like a liquid</p><p>natural blood of a plant it&rsquo;s</p><p>chlorophyll and it&rsquo;s the chemistry of</p><p>chlor of your blood is similar to</p><p>chlorophyll but with the substitution of</p><p>the magnesium versus the iron that we</p><p>have that&rsquo;s red</p><p>so</p><p>that chlorophyll</p><p>in the wheatgrass juice powder is raw</p><p>it&rsquo;s in a dormant state you just add</p><p>water</p><p>it is</p><p>it&rsquo;s fascinating because it&rsquo;s part of</p><p>the floral uh the photosynthesis which</p><p>is a basically the</p><p>solar panel</p><p>they&rsquo;re solar panels these plants and</p><p>they they convert the sunlight</p><p>to all these wonderful uh chemicals</p><p>that</p><p>give us all these great health benefits</p><p>so chlorophyll is a</p><p>great blood</p><p>builder and supporter</p><p>and nutrient enhancer</p><p>so that&rsquo;s really good um and you take</p><p>like um</p><p>yeah like one little scoop is equivalent</p><p>to like a whole tray of wheatgrass juice</p><p>now steve since we&rsquo;re on talking about</p><p>wheatgrass i have to diverge to um</p><p>i&rsquo;m growing instead of wheatgrass i&rsquo;m</p><p>growing barley grass</p><p>in a separate</p><p>small little</p><p>barn that we made</p><p>for</p><p>our animals</p><p>and so what we found was that uh</p><p>you can sprout barley seeds about six</p><p>inches</p><p>and the animals just eat it up like it&rsquo;s</p><p>a candy it&rsquo;s like the</p><p>these cattle are like uh sharks that</p><p>just eat up this they call it fodder but</p><p>it&rsquo;s a barley seed which is really</p><p>similar to um the wheatgrass</p><p>and so</p><p>here i am i have a product wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder in them and also now i can</p><p>give it to the animals and they eat the</p><p>the roots the grass everything and the</p><p>sheep and the goats love it and the pigs</p><p>will eat that like</p><p>it&rsquo;s candy so it&rsquo;s really healthy for</p><p>them and</p><p>so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing and i will be</p><p>creating some videos on that because</p><p>it&rsquo;s a very interesting</p><p>new less expensive way of feeding</p><p>animals and to spike the nutrition as</p><p>well</p><p>wow yummy indeed by the way i was being</p><p>very generous with your time dr berger</p><p>you got a few more minutes to help us</p><p>get through these last questions</p><p>yes that is terrific okay and here&rsquo;s a</p><p>question from youtube jmj wants to know</p><p>uh about your new face cream uh you know</p><p>how it works and how it can help extreme</p><p>mature dry skin talk about that product</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p><p>you know karen my wife she just loves it</p><p>because it&rsquo;s uh</p><p>there&rsquo;s these facial creams are so i was</p><p>just sick and sick and vital that just</p><p>the chemicals that they use they just</p><p>it&rsquo;s the they use the cheapest</p><p>ingredients so we have a product that</p><p>has some like some seriously high</p><p>quality essential oils and without the</p><p>chemicals</p><p>the petroleum-based chemicals and so</p><p>when you put this stuff on your face</p><p>it&rsquo;s like a whole different</p><p>thing what you have to realize is that</p><p>your skin is like a sponge even if you</p><p>put it on your hands or your any part of</p><p>your skin it goes right in goes ends up</p><p>in the liver so why would you want to</p><p>put</p><p>chemicals and mineral oils and things</p><p>like that</p><p>that are petroleum-based</p><p>um</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to put anything on your</p><p>skin that has that so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a real</p><p>quality and that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m i i really</p><p>want to focus on is</p><p>quality food and i&rsquo;m talking about</p><p>nutrient dense</p><p>quality things you put on your body on</p><p>your hair things like that</p><p>versus the the chemicals that are are</p><p>bombarded with so</p><p>um</p><p>yeah this cream is is pretty uh pretty</p><p>cool stuff and</p><p>karen loves it and you should try and</p><p>see if it helps you</p><p>that&rsquo;s wonderful okay last question the</p><p>audience has been so quick i think we</p><p>can pull it off which nutrient</p><p>deficiency is indicated by a missing</p><p>half moon in the fingernail called a</p><p>lunula like lunar i guess so uh anyway</p><p>why don&rsquo;t you guys jump on that</p><p>really quickly</p><p>and then uh yeah so that on your finger</p><p>i&rsquo;m not flipping you off uh steve but</p><p>there&rsquo;s that little um half moon there</p><p>if that&rsquo;s missing</p><p>what does that tell us as far as what</p><p>what you</p><p>you&rsquo;re missing in your in your nutrition</p><p>interesting</p><p>okay here we go uh a fruit but one that</p><p>i think you can have esp</p><p>from social media wants to know if lemon</p><p>juice is uh you can use it on an</p><p>extended fast</p><p>yes yes because the lemon juice has the</p><p>citrate and citrate reduces the</p><p>oxalates</p><p>in your body and also helps your ph uh</p><p>it helps give you</p><p>like i even recommend um</p><p>it helps with um</p><p>vitamin c</p><p>bioflavonoids especially if you take the</p><p>whole lemon</p><p>and you blend it with water and maybe a</p><p>little</p><p>electrolyte powder or maybe even some</p><p>stevia and you blend that</p><p>and you drink that down when you&rsquo;re</p><p>fasting you&rsquo;ll get a nice shot of some</p><p>serious natural vitamin c with all the</p><p>other</p><p>complex component wonderful</p><p>phytonutrients the bioflavonoids the</p><p>phenols and</p><p>it&rsquo;ll help it boost your energy and it</p><p>just</p><p>you know people i think a lot of people</p><p>are deficient in vitamin c subclinically</p><p>and don&rsquo;t even know it because they</p><p>don&rsquo;t consume enough leafy greens and uh</p><p>um</p><p>so where they&rsquo;re getting their vitamin c</p><p>you know um</p><p>lemons are a good source um especially</p><p>the outer part of the lemon or the or</p><p>even the like the rind</p><p>interesting well that&rsquo;s really good</p><p>listen uh you know people love your</p><p>products and now they&rsquo;re available</p><p>internationally in the uk where usman&rsquo;s</p><p>from russia europe singapore united arab</p><p>immigrants is there any sort of new news</p><p>in that front dock</p><p>uh no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the same news as always</p><p>um</p><p>we&rsquo;re still available in different parts</p><p>of the country if you i think we&rsquo;ll</p><p>leave a link down below if you are in</p><p>another part of the world um we may be</p><p>able to</p><p>uh speed up a shipment and decrease the</p><p>the shipping costs because of the you</p><p>know coming from the us is a bit</p><p>you know expensive</p><p>all right let&rsquo;s see uh</p><p>oh we have more handsome stuff sorry</p><p>karen i&rsquo;m gonna put that on but uh</p><p>anyway we&rsquo;re waiting for oh here it is</p><p>so the final question and that question</p><p>asked</p><p>which nutrient deficiency is indicated</p><p>by that little half moon that dr bird</p><p>just described and 35 percent of our</p><p>respondents say zinc is missing</p><p>uh 30 say got to have some more calcium</p><p>25 say magnesium and 10 say iodine</p><p>okay i&rsquo;m going to give you a hint steve</p><p>see if you could pick this up all right</p><p>all right i&rsquo;m going to see if you can</p><p>guess it the hint is um</p><p>this vitamin has cobalt in it</p><p>so what vitamin is missing</p><p>what vitamin is cobalt</p><p>my goodness a vitamin i&rsquo;d say magnesium</p><p>no</p><p>zinc how about b12 b12 i mean</p><p>methionocobolamine cobalt it&rsquo;s a b12 i</p><p>knew that that is efficiency if your</p><p>mission if you&rsquo;re low in b12 you won&rsquo;t</p><p>have those little</p><p>those little moons on your your</p><p>fingernails so</p><p>um now you have a way of knowing if</p><p>you&rsquo;re deficient and then i will be</p><p>releasing a video</p><p>uh on a do-it-yourselfer to see if</p><p>you&rsquo;re low in um iodine as well so stay</p><p>tuned for that as well so that&rsquo;ll be a</p><p>good one interesting well the whole</p><p>audience was wrong including me so we&rsquo;re</p><p>all wrong on that front what a way to</p><p>end the show but doc i think we&rsquo;ve done</p><p>all of our homework</p><p>so any closing thoughts</p><p>so i just appreciate all of your</p><p>attention i i&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re</p><p>enjoying the videos and um</p><p>thank you for your</p><p>wonderful attention i will see you</p><p>tomorrow morning released at six o&rsquo;clock</p><p>in the morning with the next video</p><p>eastern standard time have a good one</p><p>see you next week as
