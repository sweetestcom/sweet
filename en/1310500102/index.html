    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Pressfield,</p>
<p>author of several powerful nonfiction</p>
<p>and historical fiction books, including The War of Art,</p>
<p>a book that had a big impact on my life</p>
<p>and the life of millions of people</p>
<p>whose passion is to create in art, science, business,</p>
<p>sport, and everywhere else.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic,</p>
<p>including Turning Pro, Do the Work,</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and The Warrior Ethos.</p>
<p>Also, his books Gets a Fire about the Spartans</p>
<p>and the Battle of Thermopylae, The Lionsgate, Tides of War,</p>
<p>and others are some of the best</p>
<p>historical fiction novels ever written.</p>
<p>As some of you know, I don&rsquo;t shy away</p>
<p>from taking on a big, difficult challenge.</p>
<p>One of the hardest for me and for millions of others</p>
<p>is the discipline of staring at an empty page every day,</p>
<p>pushing on to think deeply, to create,</p>
<p>despite the millions of excuses that fill the head.</p>
<p>In his work, Stephen has articulated this struggle</p>
<p>better than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>

<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>I recently considered renaming this podcast</p>
<p>but decided against it.</p>
<p>AI is my passion, and in some sense,</p>
<p>this podcast is not as much about AI</p>
<p>but more about a journey of an AI researcher</p>
<p>struggling to explore the human mind,</p>
<p>the physics of our universe,</p>
<p>and the nature of human behavior,</p>
<p>intelligence, consciousness, love, and power.</p>
<p>I will continue to return home to the technical,</p>
<p>computer science, machine learning,</p>
<p>engineering, math, programming,</p>
<p>but also venture out to talk to people</p>
<p>who had a big impact on my life</p>
<p>outside the technical fields.</p>
<p>Writers like Steven Pressfield and Stephen King,</p>
<p>musicians like Tom Waits,</p>
<p>political leaders like, well, you know who,</p>
<p>and even athletes.</p>
<p>I hope you join me on this journey.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been binging on this podcast.</p>
<p>Jordan is a great human being.</p>
<p>He gets the best out of his guests,</p>
<p>dives deep, calls them out when it&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>and makes the whole thing fun to listen to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban,</p>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary Kasparov, and many more.</p>
<p>I just finished listening to his recent conversation</p>
<p>with Mick West about debunking conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>This topic can be both fascinating and frustrating</p>
<p>on both sides, but in this conversation,</p>
<p>Jordan thread the needle beautifully,</p>
<p>and so it turned out to be a great listen.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on ledgers started</p>
<p>around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar created over 200 years ago,</p>
<p>and the first decentralized cryptocurrency</p>
<p>released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency&rsquo;s still very much</p>
<p>in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still aiming to,</p>
<p>and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store</p>
<p>or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Steven Pressfield.</p>
<p>Modern society in many ways dreams</p>
<p>of creating universal peace,</p>
<p>and yet war has molded civilization</p>
<p>as we know it throughout its history.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start at the high philosophical level.</p>
<p>If you could imagine a world without war,</p>
<p>how would that world be different?</p>
<p>Perhaps put another way, what purpose has war served?</p>
<p>Why do we fight?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re basically the same creatures internally</p>
<p>that we were in the cave, right?</p>
<p>In tribal society, back for however many,</p>
<p>you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of years,</p>
<p>which means that we&rsquo;re in the dynamic in our mind</p>
<p>is a kind of an us versus them dynamic</p>
<p>where our tribe is the people,</p>
<p>and everybody else are whatever, you know?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s changed one iota over the centuries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of how one might sublimate</p>
<p>that urge to compete.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a martial artist, you know,</p>
<p>a great part of your day I&rsquo;m sure is dedicated</p>
<p>to reaching that place of total commitment</p>
<p>and in the face of competition,</p>
<p>in the face of adversity, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is, I think, natural and great for the human race</p>
<p>on an individual basis.</p>
<p>So the hope that I have, if there is any hope,</p>
<p>personally, I don&rsquo;t think the human race</p>
<p>is gonna be around very long,</p>
<p>but would be in sports</p>
<p>or in other kind of sublimated activities</p>
<p>where people can act out their need for conquest</p>
<p>or aggression or so forth,</p>
<p>but at the same time relate to their opponents</p>
<p>as human beings, and when the game is over,</p>
<p>you know, you embrace your competitors, stuff like that.</p>
<p>So you think war was inevitable, it&rsquo;s a part of human nature</p>
<p>as opposed to a force, a creative force in society</p>
<p>that served a benefit.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure it has benefited, you know,</p>
<p>spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like that,</p>
<p>but I think the urge to conquest,</p>
<p>if you think about Alexander the Great</p>
<p>or Julius Caesar or Napoleon or anybody like that,</p>
<p>or even individual, or if we even think about</p>
<p>one of the plants that we&rsquo;re looking at right outside,</p>
<p>I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way,</p>
<p>it would take over, you know, the whole hillside.</p>
<p>And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>there were, who knows, over the face of the earth,</p>
<p>hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan,</p>
<p>you know, Asia, Europe, wherever,</p>
<p>and every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering</p>
<p>his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that.</p>
<p>That seems to be a universal human imperative,</p>
<p>at least in the male of the species.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>The war is just a realization of that imperative.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve about Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>about the Six Day War in 67 in Israel,</p>
<p>against Egypt, Jordan, Syria.</p>
<p>What war, not just out of those, but in general,</p>
<p>do you think has been most transformative for the world?</p>
<p>Well, these are great questions, Lex.</p>
<p>Tough, easy ones, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols,</p>
<p>because I certainly, from what little I know,</p>
<p>I think that was a very,</p>
<p>their conquests were very transformative,</p>
<p>bringing cultures in a horrible, bloody way together.</p>
<p>But gosh, what&rsquo;s then the most transformative?</p>
<p>Maybe the Roman conquest,</p>
<p>establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture.</p>
<p>Maybe Alexander the Great&rsquo;s wars</p>
<p>that united east and west, at least for a minute.</p>
<p>So building of empire.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense, so there&rsquo;s wars,</p>
<p>I mean, the Six Day War is not about building empires.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about deeply held religious, cultural conflict</p>
<p>and holding the line, holding the border.</p>
<p>And then there is conquests, like the Mongols,</p>
<p>that, what is it, some large percentage of the population</p>
<p>is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right?</p>
<p>So that has transformative effects.</p>
<p>And then World War II, I mean, personally,</p>
<p>and my family and so on, had transformative effects.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, Lex.</p>
<p>Why are you, what are you trying to get at</p>
<p>with these questions?</p>
<p>What is this kind of the theme that you&rsquo;re aiming at?</p>
<p>Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>and he said everything is great about war</p>
<p>except the killing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a romantic notion of war.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s a romantic notion of being a warrior,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a romantic notion of war</p>
<p>that somehow there&rsquo;s a creative force to it,</p>
<p>that because we fight, out of that fighting comes culture,</p>
<p>comes music and art, and more and more desire to create</p>
<p>with the societies that win.</p>
<p>And to me, war is not just, hey, I have a stick</p>
<p>and I want your land.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some kind of, like it has echoes of the creative force</p>
<p>that makes humans unique to other animals.</p>
<p>Like, war is, it can&rsquo;t be just four people</p>
<p>or 10 people or 100 people.</p>
<p>You have to have thousands of people agreeing,</p>
<p>usually thousands or more, for something so deeply</p>
<p>that you would be willing to risk your own life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a romantic notion to that.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;ve written so well and passionate</p>
<p>about some of these, I wanted to see,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have any answers,</p>
<p>I wanted to untangle that.</p>
<p>If there is a reason we fight that&rsquo;s more than just anger</p>
<p>and hate and a way to conquer.</p>
<p>Well, let me take it from a completely different side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that I, in writing about war,</p>
<p>am really that interested in war per se.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in the metaphor.</p>
<p>I think for me, I&rsquo;m really writing about my own internal</p>
<p>war and the war against myself and against my own resistance,</p>
<p>my own negativity, all of those things</p>
<p>that spirituality would be the opposite of.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not really an expert on war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like talking to Jim Mattis</p>
<p>or to Victor Davis Hanson or whatever. To me, the human being,</p>
<p>we are spiritual beings in a physical envelope.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an automatic terrible tension within that.</p>
<p>And which creates a war inside ourselves.</p>
<p>So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army</p>
<p>standing up to, whatever, 10 to one odds</p>
<p>or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me</p>
<p>of the fight we&rsquo;re fighting inside ourselves.</p>
<p>For me, the six day war was, as you know,</p>
<p>my feeling was it was about a return from exile.</p>
<p>It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment</p>
<p>of the state of Israel, which had never really</p>
<p>been completed because the holiest places</p>
<p>of the Jewish people were in the hands of their enemies.</p>
<p>So now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great&rsquo;s conquests,</p>
<p>I think, were a whole other different scenario</p>
<p>where the metaphor was that Alexander&rsquo;s father, Philip,</p>
<p>I think created the First Nation, capital N Nation,</p>
<p>and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys</p>
<p>who were mountain men and basically barbarians,</p>
<p>Macedonians, and by creating this army</p>
<p>and this dream of conquering the world,</p>
<p>which Alexander took to the, you know, really enacted,</p>
<p>he gave them a way of rising out of themselves,</p>
<p>of transcending themselves, not just individually,</p>
<p>but as a people.</p>
<p>So that would go along with what you&rsquo;re saying, Lex,</p>
<p>of a certain creativity to it.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s not, for whatever,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just realizing this as I&rsquo;m answering this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s interesting to me</p>
<p>about these stories.</p>
<p>And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae,</p>
<p>that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war.</p>
<p>That was a sort of a willingly going to one&rsquo;s own death</p>
<p>for a greater cause, just like, to me,</p>
<p>the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group</p>
<p>what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual,</p>
<p>a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that answers your question,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how I see it.</p>
<p>I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak</p>
<p>to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time,</p>
<p>and I decline because I don&rsquo;t really feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m a spokesman for the warrior class</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s interesting about it to me.</p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t you just say, with war as a metaphor,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all essentially, in various ways, warriors?</p>
<p>If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes,</p>
<p>and think of our life at least as males,</p>
<p>and the earliest archetypes that kick in</p>
<p>are the youth and the wanderer and the student</p>
<p>and that kind of thing, and then at some point</p>
<p>around age 15 to 20, whatever,</p>
<p>the warrior archetype kicks in,</p>
<p>and we want to play football, we want to do martial arts,</p>
<p>we want to join the special forces,</p>
<p>we want to hang out with our buddies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our great bond, we want to test ourselves</p>
<p>against adversity and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But at some point, that archetype,</p>
<p>we move beyond that archetype,</p>
<p>and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And then there are many archetypes beyond that</p>
<p>towards the end.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in the warrior archetype,</p>
<p>but not to the be all and end all of everything else.</p>
<p>In my book, The Virtues of War, have you read that?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a character named Telamon,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a long story,</p>
<p>but when he&rsquo;s with Alexander&rsquo;s army,</p>
<p>and when they arrive in India,</p>
<p>he becomes fascinated by the gymnosophists,</p>
<p>the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis.</p>
<p>And he says to Alexander that these guys</p>
<p>are warriors beyond what we are, even though they do nothing</p>
<p>because they are inside their own selves all day long.</p>
<p>If we go to the Six Day War,</p>
<p>you write about, in Lionsgate,</p>
<p>you write about the Six Day War in Israel.</p>
<p>I think of the wars you&rsquo;ve written about</p>
<p>as the one we&rsquo;re still in many ways in the midst of today.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?</p>
<p>The Israeli Palestinian conflict?</p>
<p>I mean, today it&rsquo;s the Israeli Palestinian conflict,</p>
<p>but it echoes of the same conflict</p>
<p>in that part of the world with Israel.</p>
<p>What is, in your sense, the nature of that conflict?</p>
<p>What can we learn about society</p>
<p>and human nature from that conflict?</p>
<p>That is one of the hottest conflicts</p>
<p>that still goes on today.</p>
<p>Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate</p>
<p>about the Six Day War, I wrote in the introduction</p>
<p>that this was not gonna be a multi sided story.</p>
<p>I was taking it entirely, I&rsquo;m a Jew,</p>
<p>I identify with the Israeli people,</p>
<p>I was gonna see it entirely from their side.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably not what you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>but to me, the Six Day War and that whole,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a piece of land that&rsquo;s holy</p>
<p>to at least three religions and probably more.</p>
<p>And from the Jewish point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where the state of Israel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where David founded Jerusalem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>where Moses came and brought the people.</p>
<p>So to me, the Six Day War was about,</p>
<p>as I said, a return from exile,</p>
<p>from diaspora after 2000 years.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view</p>
<p>or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole other scenario.</p>
<p>Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways,</p>
<p>but religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity.</p>
<p>I mean, again, what is a Jew?</p>
<p>Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion</p>
<p>or is it somebody of a certain race</p>
<p>that race arose in a certain place?</p>
<p>Same thing as a Muslim.</p>
<p>What is a Muslim?</p>
<p>Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?</p>
<p>Or did they arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity?</p>
<p>Because if we landed from Mars,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we?</p>
<p>Just looking at them,</p>
<p>you could easily mix them and you&rsquo;d never know.</p>
<p>And the specifics of the faith</p>
<p>is not necessarily the thing that defines a person.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So you could be, like many are,</p>
<p>secular Jew living in Israel</p>
<p>and still have a strong bond.</p>
<p>Definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>In fact, almost all of the Jews,</p>
<p>the fighters that I spoke to from the Six Day War</p>
<p>were secular and it really was not</p>
<p>a religious thing with them</p>
<p>as much as it was a national thing.</p>
<p>So having spent time in Israel,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s the world where military conflict is directly felt</p>
<p>as opposed to maybe if we look at the US</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s distant and far away?</p>
<p>How is that world different?</p>
<p>How are the people different?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different, as you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Israel, actually.</p>
<p>Oh, you haven&rsquo;t? I haven&rsquo;t felt it.</p>
<p>Ah, well, you should definitely go.</p>
<p>I mean, here in the United States,</p>
<p>where when an incident like Charlottesville comes up,</p>
<p>where people are chanting,</p>
<p>Jews will not replace us, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>the impulse in the Jewish community is to think of,</p>
<p>well, how can we reach out to the other side?</p>
<p>How can we show them that we are human beings like they are</p>
<p>and show them that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of distant from war.</p>
<p>From, if you&rsquo;re in Israel,</p>
<p>like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now,</p>
<p>you would be a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever.</p>
<p>You would not just be working at MIT or whatever.</p>
<p>And I would be in the army too.</p>
<p>And so from their point of view,</p>
<p>they say all those people who hate us,</p>
<p>can I curse on this?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Can I curse on this thing?</p>
<p>Fuck them, we&rsquo;ll kill them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll kill them.</p>
<p>If they dared to cross the line,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s their whole different point of view.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s actually a healthier point of view.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, so let me ask the hard question is,</p>
<p>well, maybe it&rsquo;s an impossible question is,</p>
<p>how do we resolve that conflict?</p>
<p>In Israel and?</p>
<p>In Israel or?</p>
<p>Anywhere?</p>
<p>Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US</p>
<p>and say, F you and the people, yeah.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my, I think that the only way that two warring sides</p>
<p>or two sides that are opposed to one another</p>
<p>can ever really come together</p>
<p>is when there&rsquo;s mutual respect,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get just more water.</p>
<p>I got it, I got this.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s mutual respect</p>
<p>and they can see each other as equals</p>
<p>and when there&rsquo;s mutual fear, you know,</p>
<p>where one side says, we don&rsquo;t dare cross the line</p>
<p>with this other side,</p>
<p>and the other side says the same thing.</p>
<p>I think then you can kind of reach across that thing</p>
<p>and say, okay, we&rsquo;ll stay here, you stay here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll mingle in cultural ways</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have interchange, you know, winter marriage,</p>
<p>da, da, da, da, da, da.</p>
<p>But as soon as one side has no power,</p>
<p>as the Jewish people have had no power</p>
<p>throughout the diaspora forever, right?</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s just a human nature.</p>
<p>You can see it in Trump</p>
<p>and what he does to any vulnerable minority, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming him alone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>So I do think that that idea of like, fuck you,</p>
<p>if you cross the line, we&rsquo;ll kill you,</p>
<p>is really a good way, is a good place to start from.</p>
<p>Because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table</p>
<p>and say, you know, what do we have in common?</p>
<p>How can we, we want to raise our children.</p>
<p>You want to raise your children.</p>
<p>How can we do this in a way that we&rsquo;re not hurting each other?</p>
<p>So you kind of said that you need to arrive at a balance,</p>
<p>some kind of balance of power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you haven&rsquo;t spoken to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s deeply rooted hatred of the other.</p>
<p>So is there no way to alleviate that hatred?</p>
<p>Or is that, I mean, what role does love and hate come?</p>
<p>I think that hatred can go away.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at even now</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t seen this in person,</p>
<p>but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis</p>
<p>are collaborating in certain things, you know,</p>
<p>by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran.</p>
<p>I do think that even really long, long, longstanding</p>
<p>hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old,</p>
<p>can go away under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>In a, on what time scale?</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>do people have to die?</p>
<p>Do generations have to die and pass away</p>
<p>and new generations come up with less hate?</p>
<p>Or can a single individual learn to not hate?</p>
<p>I think a single individual can learn to not hate</p>
<p>because it certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem to,</p>
<p>over thousands of years, doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>You know, we keep thinking that that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re in a real spiritual realm here</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a realm of, you know, Buddha, Jesus, whatever,</p>
<p>something like that, that where, you know,</p>
<p>a true change of soul happens.</p>
<p>But I do think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the future of warfare?</p>
<p>Especially with what many people see as the expansion</p>
<p>of the military industrial conflict.</p>
<p>To what, do you, I know you&rsquo;re not a military historian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking more as a metaphor.</p>
<p>And do you see us as people continuing to fight?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a really great question, Alex,</p>
<p>because I think now with social media, TV, movies,</p>
<p>all of these things that create empathy across cultures,</p>
<p>it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think,</p>
<p>to totally demonize the other,</p>
<p>the way it was in previous wars.</p>
<p>I also think, I don&rsquo;t really see an appetite</p>
<p>for people wanting to go to war these days.</p>
<p>And in a way, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s so fat and lazy</p>
<p>and so concerned with how many clicks they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>that, you know, whereas I know at the start of World War I,</p>
<p>both the younger generations were eager to go to war.</p>
<p>You know, I think it was insane,</p>
<p>but it was that sort of warrior archetype</p>
<p>that we were talking about before that,</p>
<p>that generational testosterone eros thing.</p>
<p>Whereas nowadays, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to say there&rsquo;s not gonna be another war</p>
<p>because there always are,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of hard to imagine people</p>
<p>getting off their ass these days to do anything.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny that you mentioned social media</p>
<p>as a place for empathy, sure.</p>
<p>But in a sense, it&rsquo;s a place for war as well.</p>
<p>For hatred, yeah, true.</p>
<p>For hatred.</p>
<p>And perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s somewhat less harmful than murder.</p>
<p>And so it kind of dissipates sort of the hatefuls.</p>
<p>You get the hate out at a less,</p>
<p>on a daily basis and thereby never boils up</p>
<p>to a point where you want to kill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a really weird thing that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know if anybody really understands,</p>
<p>like with video games where kids are acting out</p>
<p>these incredible horror things, right?</p>
<p>But you know that if they cut their finger,</p>
<p>they would like freak out, you know?</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t think that many of the people</p>
<p>that are hateful on social media,</p>
<p>if they were face to face with the person, they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sort of two mental spheres</p>
<p>happening at the same time.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how that plays out.</p>
<p>Maps to the actual military,</p>
<p>how that actually maps to military conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you in the United States have a draft, for example,</p>
<p>how the populace would respond different than they did</p>
<p>in previous generations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they certainly would.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Another question, not sure if you&rsquo;ve thought about it,</p>
<p>but I work on building artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>In our community, many people are worried</p>
<p>about AI being used in war.</p>
<p>So automating the killing process with drones</p>
<p>and in general, it&rsquo;s being used more and more.</p>
<p>I should recuse myself on that one.</p>
<p>I really haven&rsquo;t thought about that one.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t thought about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather ask you what you think about it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting, I mean,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so fundamentally different</p>
<p>from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae.</p>
<p>It means just if we talk about the difference between a gun</p>
<p>and a sword.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you one little anecdote.</p>
<p>There was a Spartan king, I don&rsquo;t know which one it was,</p>
<p>but at one point they showed him a new invention</p>
<p>and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone</p>
<p>at a range of 200 yards.</p>
<p>And the king wept and said, alas, valor is no more.</p>
<p>Because their point of view of war,</p>
<p>it was highly ritualized, as you know,</p>
<p>and the code of honor was that you were not supposed</p>
<p>to be able to kill another person</p>
<p>unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed.</p>
<p>And any other way of doing that,</p>
<p>even bow and arrow was considered less than manly</p>
<p>and less than honorable.</p>
<p>And maybe we should go back to that</p>
<p>because at least it makes the stakes real and true.</p>
<p>Not that we could.</p>
<p>Not that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>You were in the Marine Corps,</p>
<p>so we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve written about, many of them.</p>
<p>So let me ask a personal question.</p>
<p>Have you, sort of as a writing and in general,</p>
<p>have you thought about what it takes to kill a person</p>
<p>if you yourself could do it in the war?</p>
<p>I have thought about it, yeah.</p>
<p>And how that would make you feel?</p>
<p>Of course, one never knows.</p>
<p>I certainly, I have not been in combat.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t killed anybody.</p>
<p>But I would imagine in the real world</p>
<p>that it would change you utterly forever.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t help but identify</p>
<p>with the person that you&rsquo;ve just killed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s another human being.</p>
<p>And I mean, I have a hard time killing a spider.</p>
<p>So I would imagine that it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that warriors understand and nobody else understands.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve spoken with many.</p>
<p>How, I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken with people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve seen military combat in Israel.</p>
<p>What, have they been able to articulate</p>
<p>the experience of killing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of just what I said.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m even thinking of one pilot</p>
<p>that I interviewed over there</p>
<p>who was strafing a tank in his Mustang</p>
<p>and saw, at really low altitude,</p>
<p>and saw what his bullets did to the guy</p>
<p>and could see his face and everything like that,</p>
<p>which is even one remove or more removes</p>
<p>from an infantryman, what an infantryman does.</p>
<p>And he said that same thing that I said,</p>
<p>that it just changes you and you can never say it,</p>
<p>never look at the world or look at anything</p>
<p>the same way again.</p>
<p>And when that happens at scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds.</p>
<p>That changes entire societies.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>At least it, but the problem is</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t change the politicians back home.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How important is mortality, finiteness,</p>
<p>the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?</p>
<p>So, killing and war really emphasizes that,</p>
<p>but in general, the fact that this thing ends.</p>
<p>It does?</p>
<p>It does, and uh.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>And on a serious note,</p>
<p>do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you meditate on your own mortality</p>
<p>when you think about the work you do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another great question, Lex.</p>
<p>I actually, I&rsquo;m 75, and I just was having,</p>
<p>I had breakfast in New York a few months ago</p>
<p>with a friend of mine who&rsquo;s like my exact same age.</p>
<p>And I said to him, I said,</p>
<p>Nick, do you ever think about mortality?</p>
<p>And he said, every fucking minute of every day.</p>
<p>And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too.</p>
<p>But actually, I always have, I think.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, the fact of mortality</p>
<p>gives meaning to life, you know?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why we want to create.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we want to make a mark of some kind.</p>
<p>Or, and the other aspect of it is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s on the other side of that mortality?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer in previous lives.</p>
<p>So I sort of, and I,</p>
<p>the question I&rsquo;ve never been able to answer</p>
<p>among many, many others is like, why are we even here?</p>
<p>Why are we in the flesh?</p>
<p>You know, I sort of, I like to believe that God</p>
<p>or some force is, we&rsquo;re on some kind of journey, but I&rsquo;m not sure why,</p>
<p>why we were put in this world where the ground rules are,</p>
<p>if you think about animal life,</p>
<p>that you cannot live from one day to the next</p>
<p>without killing and eating some other form of life.</p>
<p>I mean, what a demented thing, you know?</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t we just have a solar panel on our head</p>
<p>and, you know, be friends with everybody?</p>
<p>So I sort of, I don&rsquo;t get what that was all about,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of the big issue.</p>
<p>Have you read to Ernest Becker&rsquo;s Denial of Death, for example?</p>
<p>Is Ernest Becker&rsquo;s a philosopher that said that the death,</p>
<p>that the fear of death is really the primary driver</p>
<p>of everything we do.</p>
<p>So Freud had what the?</p>
<p>Right, I would agree with that.</p>
<p>So to you, you&rsquo;ve always thought about your,</p>
<p>even your own mortality.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely.</p>
<p>And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect</p>
<p>of what you were talking about?</p>
<p>Like that we kind of, what&rsquo;s your sense</p>
<p>that we had previous lives?</p>
<p>In what, have you thought concretely</p>
<p>or is it a lot of it kind of is?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve thought concretely about it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very clear when you see children,</p>
<p>young kids, or even dogs and cats,</p>
<p>that they come into the world with personalities, you know,</p>
<p>and three kids in a family are gonna be completely different</p>
<p>and completely their own person.</p>
<p>And that person that they are doesn&rsquo;t change over life.</p>
<p>And I, you know, there&rsquo;s one of the things that I did in my book</p>
<p>The Artist&rsquo;s Journey is that there were certain things</p>
<p>where I tracked or just listed in order,</p>
<p>like all of Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s albums</p>
<p>or all of Philip Roth&rsquo;s books, you know,</p>
<p>kind of a body of work throughout over, you know,</p>
<p>a period of 30, 40, 50 years, you know.</p>
<p>And you can see that there&rsquo;s a theme running through all</p>
<p>of those things, that it&rsquo;s completely unique to that person.</p>
<p>Nobody else could have written Philip Roth&rsquo;s books</p>
<p>or Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s songs.</p>
<p>And you can even see sort of a destiny there.</p>
<p>So I ask myself, well, where did that come from?</p>
<p>What, it seems to be a continuation of something that was,</p>
<p>that happened before, and that will lead to something else</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a calling, a destiny in there already.</p>
<p>This gets back to the muse and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s almost like the, there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it a God, it&rsquo;s passing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like sampling parts of a previous human</p>
<p>that has lived and putting those into the new one.</p>
<p>Sampling is probably a pretty good word.</p>
<p>Taking some of the good, well, you can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>all the good parts because the bad parts</p>
<p>is what makes the person.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re taking it all together.</p>
<p>Okay, this is humans only, or does it pass around</p>
<p>from animals in your view?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s above my pay grade, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So, okay, so you talk about the muse</p>
<p>as the source of ideas maybe.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve gotten a few glimpses of her in your writing,</p>
<p>tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her?</p>
<p>Where does she reside?</p>
<p>What does she look like?</p>
<p>I mean, you can look at it many different ways, right?</p>
<p>The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way, right?</p>
<p>They created gods that were like human beings.</p>
<p>But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective,</p>
<p>Jewish mysticism, you could say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the soul, the neshama, right?</p>
<p>That the soul is above us on a higher plane,</p>
<p>our own, your soul, my soul,</p>
<p>and is trying to reach down to us and communicate with us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying simultaneously to reach up to it</p>
<p>through prayer or through, if you&rsquo;re a writer or an artist,</p>
<p>you know, when you sit down at the keyboard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re entering into a kind of prayer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re entering into a different state</p>
<p>of an altered consciousness to some extent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening yourself, opening the pipeline,</p>
<p>or turning on the radio to tune into</p>
<p>the cosmic radio station.</p>
<p>And another way of looking at it, this is an,</p>
<p>did you ever see the movie City of Angels?</p>
<p>The visual of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen it, yep.</p>
<p>And right, the visual of the movie sort of was</p>
<p>Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon.</p>
<p>And as she&rsquo;s operating on somebody,</p>
<p>suddenly Nicolas Cage in this long duster coat,</p>
<p>like Jesse James, appears right next to her</p>
<p>in the operating room, and he&rsquo;s an angel.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s waiting to take out the soul</p>
<p>of the patient on the operating table.</p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t see him, she&rsquo;s totally unaware of him.</p>
<p>And so is everybody else in the operating room,</p>
<p>except maybe the guy who&rsquo;s about to die,</p>
<p>who suddenly sees him.</p>
<p>But I kind of believe that there are beings like that,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t like that, it&rsquo;s a force,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a consciousness, it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that are right here, right now.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to communicate to us.</p>
<p>And like through a membrane,</p>
<p>like tapping on that window over there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like right out there.</p>
<p>And they carry the future.</p>
<p>They are everything that is in potential.</p>
<p>All the works that you will do, Lex,</p>
<p>your startup, whatever else you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they know that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming up with those ideas, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Those things are appearing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in.</p>
<p>I mean, in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses appear,</p>
<p>along with the human antagonists</p>
<p>on the battlefield all the time, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be, you know, Homer flashes to Olympus</p>
<p>and then back to the real world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a thing where one Aphrodite,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say wants to help Paris.</p>
<p>And so she says, well, I will appear to him in a dream.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll take the form of his brother</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say, bump, bump, bump, bump.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s creatures, beings on one dimension,</p>
<p>as the Greeks saw it, communicating with,</p>
<p>and I believe that that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>in one, whatever analogy you want to use.</p>
<p>That communication, to which degree</p>
<p>do you play the role in that communication?</p>
<p>As opposed to sitting at the computer,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a writer, and staring at the blank page</p>
<p>and putting in the time and waiting.</p>
<p>So if, in your view, are these creatures</p>
<p>basically waiting to tell you about your future?</p>
<p>Or is there choice?</p>
<p>How many possible futures are there?</p>
<p>How many possible ideas are there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s basically, yes, there are alternatives,</p>
<p>you know, degrees within it.</p>
<p>But if you look at Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s albums,</p>
<p>how much could he have done really differently?</p>
<p>Yeah, he would, you can just see</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole impetus going through the whole thing.</p>
<p>And nothing was going to shake him off that, you know?</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe the river could have been different,</p>
<p>could have been called something else,</p>
<p>but he was dealing with certain issues.</p>
<p>His conscious self was dealing with certain issues</p>
<p>that were really out of his control.</p>
<p>He was drawn, he was called to it, right?</p>
<p>Nothing could stop him.</p>
<p>And so it is sort of a partnership, I think,</p>
<p>the creative process, between the creative impulse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from some other place,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s coming from deep within us</p>
<p>is another way to look at it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like if we are acorns</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re growing into oaks.</p>
<p>So the conscious artist,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s sitting there at the keyboard or whatever,</p>
<p>is applying his or her consciousness to that,</p>
<p>but is also going into opening themselves</p>
<p>to the unconscious or to this other realm,</p>
<p>whatever that is.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly songwriters for a million years</p>
<p>have said, you know, a song just came into their head,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>A poem, just all they had to do was write.</p>
<p>But then, you ever see that thing where,</p>
<p>of Keats&rsquo;s notes for a thing of beauty is a joy forever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like covers an entire page,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know, he&rsquo;s crossing this out</p>
<p>and that out, and he has to go.</p>
<p>His consciousness is, his conscious mind is working on it.</p>
<p>But, so I do think it&rsquo;s a partnership.</p>
<p>And I think that, I know when I was first starting out</p>
<p>as a writer, I worked in advertising,</p>
<p>and I tried to do novels that I could never do.</p>
<p>I was like, really unskilled at getting to that,</p>
<p>tuning into that station.</p>
<p>I just, I beat my brains out and was unable to do it,</p>
<p>you know, except in,</p>
<p>because I was sort of trying too hard,</p>
<p>it was sort of like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind</p>
<p>trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts</p>
<p>driving you crazy.</p>
<p>But over time, you know, knock wood,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of gotten better at it.</p>
<p>And I can sort of let go of those,</p>
<p>that part of me that&rsquo;s trying so hard.</p>
<p>And so these angels can speak a little more easily</p>
<p>through the membrane.</p>
<p>Can you put into words the process of letting go</p>
<p>and clearing that channel of communication?</p>
<p>What does it take?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another great question.</p>
<p>For me, it just took, it took probably 30 years.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even, I guess I would liken it to meditation,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m not a meditator.</p>
<p>But it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things</p>
<p>in the world to just sit still and stop thinking, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard to put into words.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why these teachers of meditation</p>
<p>use tricks and koans and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But for me, at least, I think it was just a process</p>
<p>of years of years and years of trying,</p>
<p>and finally beating my head in the wall.</p>
<p>And finally, little by little giving up</p>
<p>the beating of the head.</p>
<p>But there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any trick.</p>
<p>Everybody wants a hack these days.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there is a hack.</p>
<p>If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s watching you down there,</p>
<p>beating your head in the wall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a Marine going through an obstacle course,</p>
<p>or a martial artist trying to learn,</p>
<p>like Uma Thurman doing the casket deal,</p>
<p>trying to make that little four inch punch, you know?</p>
<p>The muse or the goddess is just sort of watching,</p>
<p>going, it&rsquo;s Lex, he&rsquo;s trying, he&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna come back in another couple of months</p>
<p>and see if he&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And finally, she&rsquo;ll say, all right, he&rsquo;s had it,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s paid his dues, I&rsquo;m gonna give it to him.</p>
<p>So, the hard work and the suffering, yeah.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also, being Russian, in wrestling and martial arts,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re big into drilling technique.</p>
<p>I was also just even getting at,</p>
<p>certainly there&rsquo;s no shortcut.</p>
<p>But is there a process?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, that can be, the process of practice.</p>
<p>So you had two.</p>
<p>One, you had an example of meditation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially the practice of meditation.</p>
<p>Is you sitting here?</p>
<p>I think a lot of drill, I think,</p>
<p>is a good way to look at it too.</p>
<p>But what are you drilling?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just sitting and?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing, you know?</p>
<p>Just writing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing, then you&rsquo;re looking at what you wrote,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hitting moments when it flows, you know?</p>
<p>And then your other hitting moments</p>
<p>where you just can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to, from the moments where it flowed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to come back and look at it and say,</p>
<p>what did I do?</p>
<p>How did that happen?</p>
<p>Where was my mind, you know?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s just a process of over and over</p>
<p>and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier.</p>
<p>And did you always, when you read something you write,</p>
<p>did you always have a pretty good radar</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s good and not after it&rsquo;s written?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think I do now.</p>
<p>But no, it was always really hard</p>
<p>for me to know what was good.</p>
<p>I mean, do you edit, the process of editing</p>
<p>is the process of looking at what you&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>and improving it.</p>
<p>Are you a better writer or an editor?</p>
<p>How often do you edit?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another great question.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Cause I do think that in writing,</p>
<p>the real process of looking at it</p>
<p>is the process that an editor does</p>
<p>rather than what a writer does.</p>
<p>The gentleman I was just talking to on the phone</p>
<p>is my editor, Sean Coyne,</p>
<p>who was the guy who bought Gates of Fire</p>
<p>when he was an editor at Doubleday.</p>
<p>And who basically when I finish a book, I give it to him.</p>
<p>And he gives me, you know,</p>
<p>editing doesn&rsquo;t really mean like crossing out commas.</p>
<p>It really means looking at the overall work</p>
<p>and saying, does it work?</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t work, why doesn&rsquo;t it work?</p>
<p>Is there something wrong here?</p>
<p>You know, like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge,</p>
<p>you know, and one span was out of whack, you know,</p>
<p>you could, and I think a really skilled editor,</p>
<p>which Sean is, understands what makes a story tick.</p>
<p>And he also has the perspective that I&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>in something I&rsquo;ve wrote, cause I&rsquo;m so close to it,</p>
<p>to say, you know, this isn&rsquo;t working and that is working.</p>
<p>What kind of advice has he given you?</p>
<p>Is it like layout?</p>
<p>Like this story doesn&rsquo;t flow correctly.</p>
<p>Like you shouldn&rsquo;t start at this point.</p>
<p>Or does he even sit back at a higher level and say,</p>
<p>I see what you&rsquo;re doing, but you could do better.</p>
<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But a lot of it is about genre</p>
<p>and kind of the defining what genre you&rsquo;re working in.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna get up here to just bring something over here</p>
<p>for the camera.</p>
<p>This was one where Sean tore this down</p>
<p>and made me start from scratch.</p>
<p>And what the specifics of it were really,</p>
<p>this is a supernatural thriller.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the genre.</p>
<p>Sort of like Rosemary&rsquo;s Baby or The Exorcist.</p>
<p>And what he showed me was that I had violated</p>
<p>certain conventions of the genre.</p>
<p>And you just can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be, it has to be done the right way.</p>
<p>And so he pointed out certain things to me.</p>
<p>So he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a tough job of editor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, he was sort of born to do that.</p>
<p>He just kind of glommed onto it.</p>
<p>But since he was his first job publishing</p>
<p>cat thrillers, cat detective books,</p>
<p>he studied how it works, what makes a story work,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so he really, he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I think any really successful writer,</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re utterly brilliant on their own,</p>
<p>has gotta have a great editor behind them.</p>
<p>But you yourself edit as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself.</p>
<p>Everything you see in my blog posts</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s about the craft of writing</p>
<p>is me trying to teach myself the rules</p>
<p>so that, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same in martial arts</p>
<p>or anything else, right?</p>
<p>You try to not be dependent on that other person</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so painful to make those mistakes.</p>
<p>You really feel like, ah, I wish I could get it right</p>
<p>the first time the next time I do it.</p>
<p>Well, in research, we go through that.</p>
<p>In research more than writing,</p>
<p>so what you do is a little more solitary.</p>
<p>In research, there&rsquo;s usually two, three, four people</p>
<p>working on something together and we write a paper.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that painful process of where you write it down</p>
<p>and then you share it with other.</p>
<p>And not only do they criticize the writing,</p>
<p>they criticize the fundamental aspects</p>
<p>of the approach you&rsquo;ve taken.</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly like they would say you&rsquo;re attacking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asking the wrong questions, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s extremely painful, especially when you,</p>
<p>well, yes, painful and helpful,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s disagreement and so on.</p>
<p>And through that comes out a better product.</p>
<p>And if you want to still have an ego,</p>
<p>but you also want to silence it every once in a while,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>In your book, The War of Art,</p>
<p>you talk about resistance, what the capital R,</p>
<p>as the invisible force in this universe of ours</p>
<p>that finds a way to prevent you from starting</p>
<p>or doing the work.</p>
<p>Where do you think resistance comes from?</p>
<p>Why is there a force in our mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts</p>
<p>with laziness, excuses, and so on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another great question.</p>
<p>I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the yetzer hurrah, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a force that if this up here is your soul</p>
<p>of Neshama trying to talk to you, us down here,</p>
<p>the yetzer hurrah is this negative force in the middle.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not the only one that ever thought about this.</p>
<p>But, and I don&rsquo;t know if anybody really knows the answer,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s my answer.</p>
<p>I think that there are two places</p>
<p>where we as human beings can see our identity.</p>
<p>One is the ego, the conscious ego,</p>
<p>and the other is the greater self.</p>
<p>And the self in the Jungian sense,</p>
<p>the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious</p>
<p>and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground,</p>
<p>which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.</p>
<p>And I think, and the ego is just this little dot</p>
<p>inside this bigger self.</p>
<p>And the ego has a completely different view of life</p>
<p>from the self.</p>
<p>The ego believes, I&rsquo;m gonna give you a long answer here.</p>
<p>No, perfect.</p>
<p>The ego believes that death is real.</p>
<p>The ego believes that time and space are real.</p>
<p>The ego believes that each one of us</p>
<p>is separate from the other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m separate from you.</p>
<p>If I could punch you in the face and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me,</p>
<p>it would only hurt you.</p>
<p>And in the ego&rsquo;s world, the dominant emotion is fear</p>
<p>because we were all made of flesh.</p>
<p>We can all die.</p>
<p>We can all be hurt.</p>
<p>We can all be ruined.</p>
<p>So we are protecting ourselves</p>
<p>and even our desire to create,</p>
<p>as we were talking about before,</p>
<p>comes out of that fear of death.</p>
<p>The self, on the other hand,</p>
<p>the greater self that butts up against the divine ground</p>
<p>believes that death is not real,</p>
<p>that time and space are not real,</p>
<p>that the gods travel swift as thought.</p>
<p>And the ego also believes that,</p>
<p>I mean, the self believes that there&rsquo;s no difference</p>
<p>between you and me, that we&rsquo;re all one.</p>
<p>If I hurt you, I hurt myself, karma, right?</p>
<p>And in the world of the self, of the greater self,</p>
<p>the dominant emotion is love, not fear.</p>
<p>Now, so I think that, I&rsquo;ll go farther back here,</p>
<p>a long way to answer your question.</p>
<p>When Jesus died on the cross,</p>
<p>or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives</p>
<p>at Thermopylae, they were acting</p>
<p>according to the rules of the self.</p>
<p>Death is not real.</p>
<p>No difference between you and me.</p>
<p>Time and space are not real.</p>
<p>Predominant emotion is love.</p>
<p>So, in my opinion,</p>
<p>we as conscious human vessels</p>
<p>are in a struggle between these two things,</p>
<p>the ego and the self.</p>
<p>To me, resistance is the voice of the ego saying,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fearful voice,</p>
<p>because if, when we identify with the self,</p>
<p>we move our consciousness over to the self</p>
<p>as artists or scientists opening ourselves up</p>
<p>to the cosmic dimension, to the other forces,</p>
<p>the ego is tremendously threatened by that.</p>
<p>Because if we&rsquo;re in that space, that head space,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need the ego anymore.</p>
<p>So I think resistance is a voice of the ego</p>
<p>trying to keep control of us.</p>
<p>In a way, I&rsquo;ll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably a very good example, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a zero sum world for him,</p>
<p>and for anybody that&rsquo;s in that.</p>
<p>And the opposite of that would be somebody</p>
<p>like Martin Luther King or Gandhi.</p>
<p>Gandhi, yep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, of course, why they all wind up</p>
<p>getting assassinated.</p>
<p>Because that voice, that ego, is hanging on to itself</p>
<p>and feels so threatened by,</p>
<p>I could talk more about this if you want to.</p>
<p>No, for sure, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s interesting why the fear is attached</p>
<p>to the ego.</p>
<p>I really like this dichotomy of ego and self</p>
<p>and that struggle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, ego has a, the self obsession of it.</p>
<p>Why fear is such a predominant thing?</p>
<p>Why is resistance trying to undermine everything?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fear, it&rsquo;s out of fear.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about the whole thing in terms of stories.</p>
<p>In a story, the villain is always resistance,</p>
<p>is always the ego.</p>
<p>The hero is always, of course, always is not everything,</p>
<p>but you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Pretty much represents kind of the self.</p>
<p>If you think about the alien on the spaceship,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the ultimate kind of villain.</p>
<p>It keeps changing form, right?</p>
<p>First it goes on the guy&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>then it pops out of his chest,</p>
<p>but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing</p>
<p>to destroy, you know?</p>
<p>And just like the ego, just like resistance.</p>
<p>And maybe alien is a bad example</p>
<p>because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight</p>
<p>on the same terms as the alien,</p>
<p>but maybe a better example might be</p>
<p>something like Casablanca,</p>
<p>where in the end, the Humphrey Bogart character</p>
<p>has to, acting, operating out of the self,</p>
<p>has to give up his selfish dream</p>
<p>of going off with Ingrid Bergman,</p>
<p>Neil Salon, the love of his life,</p>
<p>and instead, you know, puts her on the plane to Lisbon</p>
<p>while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>but in almost every story,</p>
<p>the villain is the ego, is resistance, is fear,</p>
<p>is that zero sum thing.</p>
<p>And in almost every story,</p>
<p>the hero is someone that is willing to make a sacrifice</p>
<p>to help others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s letting go of that fear</p>
<p>is what leads to productivity and to success.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>this is probably the answer is either obvious or impossible,</p>
<p>but do you think there&rsquo;s an evolutionary advantage</p>
<p>to resistance?</p>
<p>Like, what would life look like without resistance?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another great question.</p>
<p>I think, I also believe that resistance, like death,</p>
<p>gives meaning to life.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t have it, it&rsquo;s gonna be, you know,</p>
<p>what would we be?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be in the Garden of Eden,</p>
<p>picking fruit and just happy and stupid, you know?</p>
<p>And I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden</p>
<p>is really about this kind of thing, you know,</p>
<p>where Adam and Eve decide to sort of take matters</p>
<p>into their own hands and acquire knowledge</p>
<p>that until then, God had said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only one that&rsquo;s got that knowledge.</p>
<p>And of course, once they have acquired that knowledge,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re cast out into the world you and I live in now,</p>
<p>where they do have to deal with that fear</p>
<p>and they do have to deal with all that stuff.</p>
<p>The human condition.</p>
<p>The human condition and the meaning and the purpose comes</p>
<p>from the resistance being there</p>
<p>and the struggle to overcome it.</p>
<p>To overcome it, right.</p>
<p>And also the other aspect of it is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even like it&rsquo;s an actual force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all here, right?</p>
<p>So the sort of,</p>
<p>in a way, it&rsquo;s sort of a surrender to it, you know?</p>
<p>You know, or it&rsquo;s just a sort of like turning on the light</p>
<p>in a dark thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>But not quite because it&rsquo;s never really.</p>
<p>Because it comes back again tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s been, maybe recently, but in general,</p>
<p>maybe in your life, what&rsquo;s been the most relentless</p>
<p>or one of the more relentless sources of resistance</p>
<p>to you personally?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about writing for me</p>
<p>and evolving within my own body of work, you know?</p>
<p>It never goes away, it never gets any less.</p>
<p>Do you have particular excuses,</p>
<p>particular justifications that come out?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s always the same.</p>
<p>Well, I would say it&rsquo;s always the same,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really not because resistance is so protean,</p>
<p>you know, it keeps changing form.</p>
<p>And as you move to hopefully a higher level,</p>
<p>resistance gets a little more nuanced</p>
<p>and a little more subtle trying to fake you out.</p>
<p>But I think you learn that it&rsquo;s always there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always gonna have to face it, so.</p>
<p>I mean, your battle is sitting down</p>
<p>and writing to some number of words to a blank page.</p>
<p>Do you have a process there with this battle?</p>
<p>Do you have a number of hours that you put in?</p>
<p>Do you sit down?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely a believer</p>
<p>that even though this battle is fought</p>
<p>on the highest sort of spiritual level,</p>
<p>that the way you fight it is on the most mundane,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s like martial arts, must be the same way.</p>
<p>I mean, I go to the gym first thing in the morning</p>
<p>and I sort of am rehearsing myself.</p>
<p>The gym is called resistance training, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working against resistance, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna go, I don&rsquo;t wanna get out of bed,</p>
<p>I hate that, but I&rsquo;m sort of fortifying myself</p>
<p>to be ready for the day.</p>
<p>And like I said, over Knockwood, over years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not as hard for me as it used to be.</p>
<p>The real resistance, I think, for me,</p>
<p>and I think this is true for anybody,</p>
<p>is the question of sort of what&rsquo;s the next idea?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next book?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next project that you&rsquo;re gonna work on?</p>
<p>And when I ask that question, I&rsquo;m asking it of the muse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of saying, what do you want me,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m asking it of my unconscious.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re looking at Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s albums,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of, well, what&rsquo;s the next album?</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s on Broadway.</p>
<p>That was a great idea, right?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d that come from, you know?</p>
<p>But, and then for him, what&rsquo;s after that, you know?</p>
<p>Because that body of work is already alive.</p>
<p>It already exists inside us,</p>
<p>kind of like a woman&rsquo;s biological clock,</p>
<p>and we have to serve it.</p>
<p>And we have to, otherwise it&rsquo;ll give us cancer, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that if anybody has cancer</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take its revenge on us.</p>
<p>So the next resistance to me is sort of,</p>
<p>or a big aspect of it is, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>You know, when I finish the book I&rsquo;m working on now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m gonna do next.</p>
<p>And I see at the same time you have a kind of,</p>
<p>you have a sense that there&rsquo;s a Bruce Springsteen</p>
<p>single line of albums.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s already known somewhere in the universe</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to do next, is the sense you have.</p>
<p>In a sense, yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s predetermined, you know?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to believe that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.</p>
<p>Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing for sure.</p>
<p>It was always going to be that one thing.</p>
<p>But really, in reality, it&rsquo;s a distribution.</p>
<p>It could be any number of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s alternate realities.</p>
<p>Alternate realities, yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not that far apart.</p>
<p>I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write</p>
<p>a Joni Mitchell song, you know?</p>
<p>No matter how hard he tries.</p>
<p>But he still went on Broadway.</p>
<p>I mean, he still did that,</p>
<p>which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re being, in retrospect,</p>
<p>it all makes sense. I think it is</p>
<p>a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a next sort of evolution for him.</p>
<p>Why not take his music to there, you know?</p>
<p>In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you pull it off, especially.</p>
<p>Do you visualize yourself completing the work?</p>
<p>Like, Olympic athletes visualize getting the gold medal.</p>
<p>Do you, you know, they go through,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s actually a really,</p>
<p>you can learn something from athletes on that,</p>
<p>is years out,</p>
<p>certainly two, three years out,</p>
<p>some people do much longer,</p>
<p>every day, you visualize how the day</p>
<p>of the championship will go down to,</p>
<p>I mean, everything, down to how will it feel</p>
<p>to stand on the podium and so on.</p>
<p>Do you do anything like that</p>
<p>in how you approach writing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s always in the moment.</p>
<p>Because, yeah, it is in the moment, I think.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s such a mystery.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s different from sports.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t know the destiny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no gold medal at the end.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In fact, I would like to think that</p>
<p>as soon as you finish one,</p>
<p>the next day you&rsquo;re on the other.</p>
<p>And in fact, hopefully you&rsquo;ve already started the other.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already, you know, 100 pages into the other</p>
<p>when you finish the first one.</p>
<p>But it is a, it is a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a journey, it&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is a,</p>
<p>in fact, I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous to think that way.</p>
<p>To think, oh, this, I&rsquo;m gonna win the Oscar, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>For the creative process, it might be dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous?</p>
<p>Because I kind of know where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the ego.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ego.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re giving yourself over to the ego.</p>
<p>You know, I keep saying this myself.</p>
<p>My job, I&rsquo;m a servant of the muse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there to do what she tells me to do.</p>
<p>And if I suddenly think, oh, I&rsquo;m really,</p>
<p>I just wanna, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>the muse doesn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>And, you know, and she&rsquo;s on another dimension from me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to square that, because I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to square that with the,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a meditation to visualizing success</p>
<p>in the athletic realm, to where it focuses,</p>
<p>it removes everything else away,</p>
<p>to where you focus on this particular battle.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And in sports, the ego serves a more important role,</p>
<p>I think, than it does in writing.</p>
<p>And the ego, there&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Well, let me, when you say that,</p>
<p>I know what you mean, Lex, and I do think there is</p>
<p>a sort of a, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting to watch interviews</p>
<p>with Steph Curry, who&rsquo;s such, obviously such a nice guy,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got such tremendous self confidence,</p>
<p>you know, that it, but it doesn&rsquo;t border on ego so much</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s worked so hard for it, you know?</p>
<p>But he knows, so he has visualized.</p>
<p>He has visualized maybe not so much winning, you know,</p>
<p>as just him being the best he can be,</p>
<p>him being in the flow, you know,</p>
<p>doing his thing that he knows he can do.</p>
<p>And I do think in the creative world,</p>
<p>yeah, there is a sort of a thing like that,</p>
<p>where you, where, and, you know,</p>
<p>a choreographer or a filmmaker or whatever</p>
<p>might be, do an internal thing where they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I can make an Oscar winning movie.</p>
<p>I can direct this movie.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m banishing these thoughts</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not good enough.</p>
<p>I can do that.</p>
<p>I can edit it.</p>
<p>I can score it.</p>
<p>I can, you know, bump it, bump it, bump.</p>
<p>But, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really ego.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the process in a good way,</p>
<p>like an athlete does that.</p>
<p>So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes</p>
<p>come with, and you think it&rsquo;s possible to,</p>
<p>as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself?</p>
<p>I do think so, you know, that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>when John Lennon sat down to write a song,</p>
<p>he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>I think, because the great artists I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re haunted by self doubt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that resist, I mean, the confidence.</p>
<p>Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even beyond the self,</p>
<p>within the self, above the self doubt.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the bigger picture of the self belief, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m freaking out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m worried that I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to do it.</p>
<p>But, you know, I know I can do this.</p>
<p>Yeah, and when you look at,</p>
<p>when you take a bigger picture of it.</p>
<p>So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely?</p>
<p>No, because you&rsquo;re with your characters.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>So you really put yourself in the world.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you know, I&rsquo;ve written about this before</p>
<p>that I used to, my desk used to face a wall</p>
<p>instead of seeing, and people would say,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t you wanna look out the window?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m in here, I mean, I&rsquo;m seeing, you know,</p>
<p>the Spartans, I&rsquo;m seeing, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>And the characters that are on the page,</p>
<p>or that you create, are not accidents, you know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming out of some issue,</p>
<p>some deep issue that you have.</p>
<p>Whether you realize it or not,</p>
<p>you might not realize it till 20 years later,</p>
<p>or somebody explains it to you.</p>
<p>So your characters are kind of fascinating to you.</p>
<p>And their dilemmas are fascinating to you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also trying to come to grips with them,</p>
<p>you know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly,</p>
<p>you know, and you really wanna see them more clearly.</p>
<p>So yeah, no, it&rsquo;s not lonely at all.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m more lonely sometimes later,</p>
<p>going out to dinner with some people</p>
<p>and actually talking to people.</p>
<p>Do you miss the characters after it&rsquo;s over?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have affection for them,</p>
<p>kind of like children that have gone off to college</p>
<p>and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Definitely, I have affection for them, even the bad guys.</p>
<p>Maybe especially the bad guys.</p>
<p>Especially the bad guys.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that writers, even successful writers,</p>
<p>are often not tough minded enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that in the post,</p>
<p>that you have to be a professional</p>
<p>in the way you handle your emotions.</p>
<p>You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer.</p>
<p>So what do you think makes a warrior?</p>
<p>Is a warrior born or trained in the realm,</p>
<p>in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing,</p>
<p>in the creative process?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re born to some extent.</p>
<p>You have the gift, like you might have the gift</p>
<p>as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do,</p>
<p>but the training is the big thing.</p>
<p>90% training, 10%, 10% genetics.</p>
<p>And, you know, I use another analogy other than warrior</p>
<p>as far as writer, and that&rsquo;s like to be a mother.</p>
<p>If you think about, if you&rsquo;re a writer</p>
<p>or any creative person, you&rsquo;re giving birth to something,</p>
<p>right, you&rsquo;re carrying a new life inside you.</p>
<p>And in terms of bravery,</p>
<p>if your child, your two year old child</p>
<p>is underneath a car that&rsquo;s coming down the street,</p>
<p>the mother&rsquo;s gonna like stop a Buick,</p>
<p>you know, with her bare hands.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way to think about</p>
<p>how a writer has to think about,</p>
<p>or any creative person has to think about,</p>
<p>I think, what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>what this child, this new creation</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re bringing forth.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the hard work that&rsquo;s underlying that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just, a couple weeks ago, talked to,</p>
<p>just happened to be in the same room,</p>
<p>both gave talks, Arianna Huffington.</p>
<p>I did this conversation with her.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know much about her before then,</p>
<p>but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books</p>
<p>and been promoting a lifestyle</p>
<p>where she basically, she created the Huffington Post,</p>
<p>and she gave herself like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>20 hours a day just obsessed with her work.</p>
<p>And then she fainted, passed out,</p>
<p>and kind of, there was some health issues.</p>
<p>And so she wrote this book saying that, you know, sleep,</p>
<p>basically you wanna establish a lifestyle</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice health,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s productive but doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice health.</p>
<p>She thinks that you can have both,</p>
<p>productivity and health.</p>
<p>Criticizing Elon Musk, who I&rsquo;ve also spoken with,</p>
<p>for working too hard,</p>
<p>and thereby sacrificing, you know,</p>
<p>being less effective than he could be.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to get this balance between health</p>
<p>and obsessively working at something</p>
<p>and really working hard.</p>
<p>So what Arianna is talking about makes sense to me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a little bit torn.</p>
<p>To me, passion and reason do not overlap much</p>
<p>or at all sometimes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being too Russian,</p>
<p>but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health</p>
<p>or sleep or diet or any of that.</p>
<p>And hard work is hard work,</p>
<p>and everything else can go to hell.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re really focused on whether it&rsquo;s writing a book,</p>
<p>it should, everything should just go to hell.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on this balance?</p>
<p>How important is health for productivity?</p>
<p>How important is it to sort of get sleep and so on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the health side.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a period of my life</p>
<p>when I was just, I had no obligations</p>
<p>and I was just living in a little house</p>
<p>and just working nonstop, you know?</p>
<p>But even then I would get up in the morning</p>
<p>and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast every day,</p>
<p>and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was.</p>
<p>But although I was still doing like 18 hours a day,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m definitely, I kind of think of it</p>
<p>sort of like an athlete does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed</p>
<p>to winning championships and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But he has his family, he sees his family,</p>
<p>you know, the family is always there.</p>
<p>He, I&rsquo;m sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff,</p>
<p>gets his sleep, you know, gets the training,</p>
<p>you know, the whatever a trainer does to him</p>
<p>for his knees and his ankles and whatever.</p>
<p>So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s operating at a high level.</p>
<p>So I do think I&rsquo;m from that kind of the health school.</p>
<p>The good thing about being a writer</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t work very many hours a day.</p>
<p>You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to work more than that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how people do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of people do 10, 12, I don&rsquo;t know how they do it.</p>
<p>So that gives you a lot of other time to do it.</p>
<p>Optimize your health.</p>
<p>Yeah, to optimize your health.</p>
<p>Because you need to, you&rsquo;re in training, you know?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really, you&rsquo;re burning up a lot of B vitamins</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re working here, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, but.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a Russian thing with you, Lex.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not even a Russian thing.</p>
<p>It also may be youth, you know?</p>
<p>At 35, you can be crazy.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the thing, they keep telling me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll be added still at a later time too.</p>
<p>I think it has to do with the career choice too.</p>
<p>I think writing is almost, from everything I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do it</p>
<p>more than a few hours really well.</p>
<p>When you start to get into certain disciplines,</p>
<p>like with Elon Musk and me, engineering disciplines,</p>
<p>that really there&rsquo;s a lot more non muse time needed.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>So the crazy hours that you often are talking about</p>
<p>have to be done, and it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s still the two, three hours of muse time</p>
<p>needed for truly genius ideas,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I certainly struggle with.</p>
<p>But yeah, I hear you loud and clear on the health.</p>
<p>So what does a perfect day look like for you</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about writing?</p>
<p>An hour by hour schedule of a perfect day.</p>
<p>I get up early, I go to the gym,</p>
<p>I have breakfast with some friends of mine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s early by the way?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, like how early?</p>
<p>3.15.</p>
<p>A.M.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking really early.</p>
<p>Really early.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m crazy early, it&rsquo;s ridiculously early.</p>
<p>But, and I haven&rsquo;t done that always,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m on now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in bed, like when I&rsquo;m with my nephews</p>
<p>that are like four years old and three years old,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in bed before them.</p>
<p>Okay, you got a beat.</p>
<p>You wake up, sorry, you said exercise first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what does that look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s exercise for you?</p>
<p>You go out to the gym?</p>
<p>I go to the gym.</p>
<p>I have a trainer, I have a couple of guys</p>
<p>that I work out with, and I&rsquo;ll, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe an hour, maybe a little more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a little warmup before stretching afterwards,</p>
<p>take a shower, go have breakfast.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an intense kind of a thing</p>
<p>that I definitely don&rsquo;t wanna do that&rsquo;s hard, you know?</p>
<p>So you feel like you&rsquo;ve accomplished something, first thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big accomplishment of the day.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s not like so hard</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m completely exhausted, you know?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll come home and handle whatever correspondence</p>
<p>and stuff has to be done, and then I work</p>
<p>for maybe three hours, and then I just sort of crash.</p>
<p>The office is closed, I turn the switch,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about the work at all.</p>
<p>Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards?</p>
<p>After work, once the office is closed.</p>
<p>But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing?</p>
<p>Something like that, yeah.</p>
<p>Something like that, okay.</p>
<p>You listen to music?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you have anything?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just me, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>but somebody could do it a million different ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, you know, the,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve also, of most, of many writers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really, but like I&rsquo;ve read Stephen Kington writing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve optimized this conversation</p>
<p>with the muse you&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>Not optimized, but you&rsquo;ve at least thought about it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s, can you say a little bit more</p>
<p>about the trivialities of that process,</p>
<p>of the, like you said, facing the wall?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, do you have little rituals?</p>
<p>You mean like the granular aspect of it?</p>
<p>The granular aspects, yeah.</p>
<p>Is there?</p>
<p>I do have little rituals, I do have all kinds of,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not even gonna tell you about.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But the one thing,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna like talk about this too much</p>
<p>because it sort of jinxes things, I think,</p>
<p>but the one thing I do try to do is when I sit down,</p>
<p>I immediately get into it, first, second.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sit and fuck around with anything.</p>
<p>I immediately try to get into it as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>The other thing is that writing a book</p>
<p>or screenplay or anything like that</p>
<p>is a process of multiple drafts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first draft</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re most with the muse,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going through the blank page.</p>
<p>Like right now I&rsquo;m on, I don&rsquo;t know what,</p>
<p>the fifth or sixth, seventh draft</p>
<p>of the thing I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got pages already written</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m kind of reading them afresh</p>
<p>as I go through the story.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not quite where I am now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite a deep muse scenario, partly it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also sort of bouncing back and forth</p>
<p>between the different,</p>
<p>between the right brain and the left brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of looking at it</p>
<p>and trying to evaluate it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going into it</p>
<p>and try to change it a little bit.</p>
<p>And when, do you know,</p>
<p>sit down and get right into it,</p>
<p>do you know the night before</p>
<p>of what that starting point is?</p>
<p>I always try to stop.</p>
<p>And I learned this,</p>
<p>I think Hemingway wrote about this</p>
<p>or John Steinbeck or one of the,</p>
<p>or maybe both of them,</p>
<p>to always stop when you kind of know what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not at a facing a chasm, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so and afterwards when you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>the office is closed.</p>
<p>The office is closed,</p>
<p>I let the muse take care of it, you know?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a very unhealthy thing</p>
<p>to worry about it or think about any creative process.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, like on a long walk later, think about?</p>
<p>Yeah, then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t be like obsessing about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because actually on walks,</p>
<p>sometimes things will pop in your head, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll go, oh, I should change that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not your ego doing it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the deeper level.</p>
<p>Okay, so how does the day end?</p>
<p>So go. In terms of writing?</p>
<p>So yeah, the writing, well no,</p>
<p>the writing, the office door closes</p>
<p>and then the rest of the day just do whatever the hell.</p>
<p>Maybe go out to dinner,</p>
<p>my girlfriend is not here now,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in New York working,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make dinner or whatever.</p>
<p>Go out to dinner, something like that,</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ll read something, nothing heavy.</p>
<p>And I go to bed pretty early,</p>
<p>and the gym is a big thing for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll already, sort of probably like with you</p>
<p>with martial arts, the night before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be visualizing what I have to do the next day</p>
<p>and getting myself psyched up for that.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just conk out like a light</p>
<p>and wake up at the crack of dawn.</p>
<p>Okay, so looking out into the future,</p>
<p>this year, next few years,</p>
<p>what do you think the muse has in store for you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can ever know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably something along the same,</p>
<p>I really believe there&rsquo;s that exercise</p>
<p>where they say to you,</p>
<p>visualize yourself five years in the future</p>
<p>and write a letter from that person to yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in that at all</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think you can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a line out of Africa</p>
<p>that God made the world round</p>
<p>so that we couldn&rsquo;t see too far ahead.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t know as a writer or as a person,</p>
<p>I never knew, my first book was A Legend of Bag of Ants.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t, before that happened,</p>
<p>I had no clue that I was gonna be writing anything like that</p>
<p>on that subject, anything at all, no clue,</p>
<p>until it just sort of came.</p>
<p>And then when that was done,</p>
<p>people said, well, you gotta write another one.</p>
<p>I had no idea what it was,</p>
<p>which was gonna be Gates of Fire, no clue.</p>
<p>So if somebody had sat me down at the start of that</p>
<p>and asked the question,</p>
<p>I would have been crazy to have said it.</p>
<p>So I just hope as the future unfolds,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m open to it.</p>
<p>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>in saying that we look forward to what that future looks like.</p>
<p>Stephen, thank you so much for talking today, it was fun.</p>
<p>You got the best job in the world going around</p>
<p>talking to people that you wanna talk to</p>
<p>and that they will talk to you.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>Hey, thank you for the great questions you made me think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly a bunch of questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never ever answered before.</p>
<p>Awesome, thank you so much.</p>
<p>So thanks a lot, great.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Stephen Pressfield.</p>
<p>Are you paralyzed by fear?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>Fear is good.</p>
<p>Like self doubt, fear is an indicator.</p>
<p>Fear tells us what we have to do.</p>
<p>Remember one rule of thumb,</p>
<p>the more scared we are of a work or a calling,</p>
<p>the more sure we can be that we have to do it.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
