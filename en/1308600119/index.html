    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Sarah Gottfried.</p>
<p>Dr. Sarah Gottfried is an obstetrician gynecologist</p>
<p>who did her undergraduate training in bioengineering</p>
<p>at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
<p>She then completed her medical training</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>and she currently is a clinical professor</p>
<p>of integrative medicine and nutritional sciences</p>
<p>at Thomas Jefferson University.</p>
<p>She has also been a clinician treating men and women</p>
<p>in various aspects of hormone health and longevity</p>
<p>for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>She is an expert in not just traditional medicine</p>
<p>as it relates to hormones and fertility,</p>
<p>but also nutritional practices,</p>
<p>supplementation, and behavioral practices,</p>
<p>and combining all of that expertise</p>
<p>in order to help women navigate every aspect</p>
<p>and dimension of their hormones, longevity, and vitality,</p>
<p>ranging from puberty to young adulthood,</p>
<p>adulthood, perimenopause, and menopause.</p>
<p>And nowadays, she&rsquo;s also treating men across the lifespan</p>
<p>in terms of longevity, vitality, and hormone health.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried shares an enormous amount of information</p>
<p>and tools that women can apply toward their hormone health,</p>
<p>fertility, vitality, and longevity.</p>
<p>We discussed the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>which many people have heard about,</p>
<p>but Dr. Gottfried points out the specific needs</p>
<p>that women have in terms of managing their gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways that that influences things</p>
<p>like estrogen levels and metabolism,</p>
<p>testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone, and much more.</p>
<p>We also discussed nutrition and exercise.</p>
<p>We touch on how the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>play a particularly important role</p>
<p>in managing female hormone health.</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried points out why women have particular needs</p>
<p>when it comes to essential fatty acids</p>
<p>and how best to obtain those essential fatty acids</p>
<p>for hormone health.</p>
<p>We also discuss exercise,</p>
<p>and she offers some surprising information</p>
<p>about the types and ratios of resistance training</p>
<p>to cardiovascular training that women ought to use</p>
<p>in order to maximize their hormone health.</p>
<p>We also talk a lot about the digestive system.</p>
<p>This was a surprising aspect of the conversation</p>
<p>I did not anticipate.</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried shared with us, for instance,</p>
<p>that women suffer from digestive issues</p>
<p>at more than 10 times the frequency that do men.</p>
<p>And fortunately, that there are tools specific to women</p>
<p>that they can use in order to overcome</p>
<p>those digestive issues,</p>
<p>and that in overcoming those digestive issues,</p>
<p>they can overcome many of the related hormone issues</p>
<p>that so many women face.</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried also shares with you tremendous knowledge</p>
<p>about the specific types of tests, not just blood tests,</p>
<p>but also urine and microbiome tests that women can use</p>
<p>in order to really get a clear understanding</p>
<p>of their hormone status, not just of present,</p>
<p>but also where the trajectory of their hormones</p>
<p>is taking them.</p>
<p>So we have an avid discussion about puberty,</p>
<p>about young adulthood, adulthood, perimenopause,</p>
<p>and how best to manage and navigate perimenopause</p>
<p>and menopause, including a discussion</p>
<p>about hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>In addition to her academic and clinical expertise,</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried has authored many important books</p>
<p>on nutrition, hormones, and supplementation</p>
<p>as it relates to women and to people generally.</p>
<p>The two books that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>and that we provided links to in the show note captions</p>
<p>are Women, Food, and Hormones, and The Hormone Cure.</p>
<p>I read The Hormone Cure and found it</p>
<p>to be tremendously interesting and informative,</p>
<p>not just in terms of teaching me about female hormone health</p>
<p>and various treatments for female hormone health,</p>
<p>but also as a man trying to understand</p>
<p>how the endocrine system interacts with mindset,</p>
<p>nutrition, and supplementation more generally.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend The Hormone Cure</p>
<p>for anybody interested in hormones and hormone health</p>
<p>and Women, Food, and Hormones in particular for women.</p>
<p>Although again, both books are going to be</p>
<p>strongly informative for women wishing to optimize</p>
<p>their hormone health, vitality, and longevity.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Roka.</p>
<p>Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>I spent a lifetime working on the biology</p>
<p>of the visual system, and I can tell you</p>
<p>that your visual system has to contend</p>
<p>with an enormous number of challenges</p>
<p>in order for you to be able to see clearly.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you go from a very brightly lit area</p>
<p>to a dim lit area, your visual system has to make</p>
<p>all sorts of adjustments that allow you</p>
<p>to still see your environment.</p>
<p>Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were built</p>
<p>with the biology of the visual system in mind.</p>
<p>So no matter what environment you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>And they have terrific aesthetics,</p>
<p>an enormous number of choices in terms of aesthetic.</p>
<p>So unlike a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses</p>
<p>out there that only give you the option</p>
<p>to wear the ones that make you look like a cyborg,</p>
<p>they have those options, but they also have</p>
<p>a lot of options with aesthetics</p>
<p>that you would be perfectly comfortable wearing</p>
<p>to work or to dinner or anywhere else.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Roka glasses,</p>
<p>you can go to roka.com, that&rsquo;s R-O-K-A.com,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>And as many of you know, I&rsquo;m not a fan</p>
<p>of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,</p>
<p>there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this and has designed</p>
<p>different nootropics in order to bring your brain</p>
<p>into specific states for specific types of work.</p>
<p>So for instance, for creative work</p>
<p>or to engage with more focus</p>
<p>or to give you more energy for cognitive or physical work.</p>
<p>So with Thesis, they&rsquo;ll design custom nootropics for you</p>
<p>that will allow you more focus,</p>
<p>better task switching, more creativity, and so on.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be sure to include only the ingredients</p>
<p>that you want and not the ingredients that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than a year now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer for me.</p>
<p>I like the clarity formula prior</p>
<p>to long bouts of cognitive work</p>
<p>or the energy formula prior to physical workouts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try your own personalized</p>
<p>nootropic starter kit, go online</p>
<p>to TakeThesis.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take a brief three-minute quiz</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s TakeThesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>To find the supplements we discuss</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that</p>
<p>the library of those supplements is constantly expanding.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Sarah Gottfried.</p>
<p>Dr. Gottfried, Sarah, welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you, so happy to be here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m delighted and very excited to ask you</p>
<p>about an enormous number of topics.</p>
<p>You are expert in so many things.</p>
<p>So the challenge for me is going to be</p>
<p>to constrain this walk as it were,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping that we can touch on</p>
<p>a great number of things today.</p>
<p>The first of which is really about hormones</p>
<p>and female hormones in particular.</p>
<p>And I have a question which is,</p>
<p>is it ever informative for a woman regardless of age</p>
<p>to know something about her mother&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>perhaps even her grandmother&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>vis-a-vis hormones?</p>
<p>Not just pregnancy challenges with,</p>
<p>or ease with pregnancy and child,</p>
<p>rearing childbirth, this sort of thing,</p>
<p>but what sorts of conversations</p>
<p>should women be having with themselves</p>
<p>and with family members to get a window</p>
<p>into what their specific needs might be?</p>
<p>Love this question.</p>
<p>So my work is really at the interface</p>
<p>between genetics and empowerment.</p>
<p>So your question gets to both.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s essential that you understand</p>
<p>what your grandmother went through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d even say your great-grandmother,</p>
<p>depending on longevity in your family.</p>
<p>So I grew up with my great-grandmother, I get that.</p>
<p>And especially your mother.</p>
<p>So I would probably start first with trauma</p>
<p>and intergenerational trauma,</p>
<p>because I think that affects the endocrine system so hugely,</p>
<p>especially cortisol signaling,</p>
<p>but the broader pine system,</p>
<p>psychoimmunoneuroendocrine system.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, if I think about the stages,</p>
<p>the life cycle that a woman goes through,</p>
<p>if you think about puberty,</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know how genetically determined</p>
<p>the age of puberty is.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s a lot of environmental influences,</p>
<p>like toxins can affect it.</p>
<p>But pregnancy, the age at which you start</p>
<p>to go through perimenopause menopause,</p>
<p>many of those have a genetic component.</p>
<p>So with pregnancy, I mean, you can certainly think</p>
<p>the shape of the pelvis,</p>
<p>your ability to have a vaginal birth.</p>
<p>Some of that is genetically determined.</p>
<p>I mean, you do have the sperm donor affecting some of that.</p>
<p>But in my family, for instance,</p>
<p>we have no cesarean sections.</p>
<p>So everyone goes through this process</p>
<p>of a relatively easy vaginal birth.</p>
<p>I was a forceps baby, but for the most part,</p>
<p>you can find out about that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s certain female conditions</p>
<p>that have a very strong component genetically,</p>
<p>most of which run in my family.</p>
<p>So that includes endometriosis, fibroids.</p>
<p>I just had a hysterectomy.</p>
<p>I had 50 plus fibroids and polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p>And of those three, how frequent are those?</p>
<p>And maybe I can constrain the question a little bit</p>
<p>by saying today&rsquo;s discussion I imagine is gonna be heard</p>
<p>by men and women of all sorts of ages.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll direct the question a little bit</p>
<p>toward at what age should these discussions start?</p>
<p>We always imagine that women in their 30s and 40s</p>
<p>and 50s and onward should be getting certain tests</p>
<p>and addressing things like ovarian reserve</p>
<p>and other sorts of things.</p>
<p>But maybe we could march through and just say</p>
<p>for a woman in her teens who&rsquo;s already hit puberty,</p>
<p>what sorts of biomarkers,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re blood-based or phenotyping,</p>
<p>the outward appearance of,</p>
<p>should those young women be paying attention to?</p>
<p>Likewise for women in their 20s, 30s,</p>
<p>maybe we could take it more or less by decade</p>
<p>starting at puberty.</p>
<p>Assuming that woman hits puberty sometime,</p>
<p>what between what is it now?</p>
<p>The average in the US is somewhere</p>
<p>between 12 and 16 years old.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>No, you do not.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>I love to be wrong, so.</p>
<p>So it used to be 12 to 16.</p>
<p>I would say 50 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been moving younger.</p>
<p>And we think some of that is related to toxin exposure</p>
<p>as I mentioned, but I was 10 when I went through puberty.</p>
<p>So, well, I should say menarche</p>
<p>and I started growing breasts much before that.</p>
<p>So I think now I&rsquo;m gonna step away</p>
<p>from the science for a moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do that pretty fluidly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll try to call it out.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also a huge influence from stress</p>
<p>and like the development of the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>So going back to the science,</p>
<p>the issue in teenage years</p>
<p>is that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis,</p>
<p>and I like to think of it broader.</p>
<p>So stay with me.</p>
<p>Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal,</p>
<p>gonadal of recent women, testes of men,</p>
<p>thyroid, gut axis.</p>
<p>So that to me is the control system.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of expressing my bioengineering side here.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s great to include the other organs</p>
<p>and tissue systems of the body,</p>
<p>because as we both know that the narrow definition</p>
<p>of just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be just that, right?</p>
<p>No. It can&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>No. Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>So if you look at the main sex hormones</p>
<p>in a young woman who&rsquo;s in her teenage years,</p>
<p>the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal gonadal part of that</p>
<p>is not fully mature.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re more likely to skip periods,</p>
<p>especially under stress.</p>
<p>They have a lot of influences.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t get well-established</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re done with adolescence.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m told that adolescence now</p>
<p>is till like age 25 to 26.</p>
<p>I heard that and I was like, I&rsquo;ve got two daughters.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, that&rsquo;s a really long time.</p>
<p>Not just psychologically defined or biopsychosocial?</p>
<p>Mostly psychologically defined.</p>
<p>I heard that from a psychologist.</p>
<p>So biomarkers you asked about.</p>
<p>In your teenage years, what I think is really interesting</p>
<p>is to look at cortisol.</p>
<p>To look at the dance between estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>in those years is less helpful,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a lot of variability</p>
<p>due to the immaturity of the system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got someone who&rsquo;s got really regular periods,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably better to do some benchmarking at that age.</p>
<p>But generally I find that benchmarking</p>
<p>is best performed in your 20s or 30s.</p>
<p>Are periods not that regular in terms of duration</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>when the menstrual cycle first sets in?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>So I was like clockwork every 28 days</p>
<p>until I had my hysterectomy in August.</p>
<p>Same thing with my daughters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two daughters.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s 17, the other&rsquo;s 23.</p>
<p>For a lot of women, they&rsquo;re not regular.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the whole piece of oral contraceptives</p>
<p>and other forms of contraception</p>
<p>where you have no idea what the normal cycle is.</p>
<p>And I hope we&rsquo;ll have some time</p>
<p>to talk a little bit about oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>because I think it is,</p>
<p>this is now opinion again and not science,</p>
<p>I think it is the number one endocrinopathy</p>
<p>that is iatrogenic for women.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about oral contraceptives</p>
<p>in the social media space</p>
<p>and also questions about IUDs quite a lot.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>In particular, copper IUDs, non-hormonal IUDs.</p>
<p>So we will definitely touch on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an IUD crusader,</p>
<p>so I just want to give you that warning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fan, do I have that right?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re anti-IUD?</p>
<p>I am a huge fan.</p>
<p>Which IUDs in particular?</p>
<p>So I like copper because it&rsquo;s non-hormonal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as effective as getting your tubes tied.</p>
<p>Who would have thought?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that toxic to the sperm mobility,</p>
<p>is that how it works?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my understanding of it,</p>
<p>is that it basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like more or less an electric fence to the sperm cap</p>
<p>and just, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Electric fence is a bit of a harsh analogy,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll work with that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>to have something that can last for 10 years</p>
<p>so that you really have complete autonomy</p>
<p>and sovereignty over your sexual life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s profound.</p>
<p>And to not get all those downstream risks</p>
<p>that are associated with the birth control pill.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s important to know about it,</p>
<p>I know this is a sidebar,</p>
<p>women who use the copper IUD</p>
<p>have the highest satisfaction rate</p>
<p>of anyone on contraceptives.</p>
<p>The highest satisfaction rate.</p>
<p>And yet, it is the least used</p>
<p>of all forms of contraception.</p>
<p>Now, my favorite is vasectomy,</p>
<p>but short of vasectomy,</p>
<p>I think the IUD is a really great choice.</p>
<p>There are some risks associated with it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s risk-free,</p>
<p>but I love the IUD.</p>
<p>And I love it for younger women too,</p>
<p>because it used to be that</p>
<p>when I went through my training,</p>
<p>which was 30 years ago,</p>
<p>we were told, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put it in someone who hasn&rsquo;t had a baby.</p>
<p>And that is patriarchal messaging.</p>
<p>But getting back to your original question,</p>
<p>which is about biomarkers per decade,</p>
<p>in your 20s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you want to do some base casing</p>
<p>with estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really helpful</p>
<p>to know about this tango.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re from Argentina, or your father is.</p>
<p>I have Argentine lineage.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My grandparents did tango into their late 80s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my late 40s and I still haven&rsquo;t started.</p>
<p>So I suppose there&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>It might be time for you to look at that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it might be a factor in their longevity.</p>
<p>Did they have good healthspan?</p>
<p>Not just lifespan?</p>
<p>And my grandfather smoked cigarettes daily,</p>
<p>remained mentally sharp until he died in his late 90s,</p>
<p>but almost burned down their apartment several times</p>
<p>falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t recommend anyone smoke, by the way.</p>
<p>But it was coffee, mate, red meat, and cigarettes,</p>
<p>and they lived into their 90s.</p>
<p>That side of my family has the genetic advantage.</p>
<p>The other side, less so.</p>
<p>But in any event, tango is a 2023 goal.</p>
<p>It has been every year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hold you accountable to that.</p>
<p>Okay, will do.</p>
<p>And there will be no YouTube video of me doing tango.</p>
<p>At least not initially.</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss, actually, a phenomenal podcaster, as we know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bad-ass tango.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bad-ass tango dancer.</p>
<p>I know this through various sources.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this tango between estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>is incredibly important.</p>
<p>You wanna have the right lead,</p>
<p>you wanna have the right follow between the two hormones.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m stepping away from my science hat.</p>
<p>But what happens a lot of the time</p>
<p>is that estrogen dominates in that tango.</p>
<p>And when that happens, it sets you up</p>
<p>for greater risk of fibroids, endometriosis, breast pain,</p>
<p>probably in association with the microbiome</p>
<p>and the oestrobilome.</p>
<p>Can you familiarize me with the oestrobilome?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to know that I don&rsquo;t recognize the term.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the oestrobilome is the set of microbes</p>
<p>in, and their DNA, their DNA mostly,</p>
<p>in the gut microbiome, that set of microbes in their DNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the, if you look at the totality,</p>
<p>the subset of particular bacteria modulate estrogen levels.</p>
<p>So a lot of this work was spearheaded by Martin Glaser.</p>
<p>And what we know is that there are some women</p>
<p>who have an oestrobilome that makes them have a greater risk</p>
<p>of certain estrogen-mediated conditions</p>
<p>like breast cancer, endometrial cancer,</p>
<p>and in men, prostate cancer.</p>
<p>So the oestrobilome is incredibly important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of attention paid to it,</p>
<p>but I always think in terms of my patients,</p>
<p>could this be someone who&rsquo;s got a faulty oestrobilome</p>
<p>and we need to adjust it with some of the microbiome</p>
<p>modulating nutrients, nutraceuticals that we have</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re less likely to have that tango</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not working with estrogen and progesterone.</p>
<p>So getting back to the biomarkers,</p>
<p>if you gave me an unlimited budget,</p>
<p>which I kind of have with some of my clients</p>
<p>that I work with now, what I would wanna know</p>
<p>is estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,</p>
<p>and I want the timing right for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wanna know about DHEA</p>
<p>and sort of the whole androgen pathway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wanna know about the metabolites of estrogen</p>
<p>because some of them are protective and very helpful.</p>
<p>Others are a bit like Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I mean, they are just like causing all kinds of problems</p>
<p>in your body, increasing the risk of quinones,</p>
<p>like DNA damage,</p>
<p>and potentially an increased risk of breast cancer,</p>
<p>although that data I think is mixed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to know about their stool.</p>
<p>So I wanna know about the microbiome.</p>
<p>So the best that we have right now is to look</p>
<p>when we do stool testing, and I do a lot of stool testing.</p>
<p>We can look at things like beta-glucuronidase.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with BG?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with it as a term.</p>
<p>And so for those listening, very often,</p>
<p>not always when you hear an ACE, A-S-E,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with an enzyme.</p>
<p>So we can take a stab there.</p>
<p>And it sounds like it&rsquo;s somehow involved</p>
<p>in glucose metabolism of some sort, or is it?</p>
<p>Glucuronidase, so it&rsquo;s involved in,</p>
<p>when you produce estrogen in the body,</p>
<p>this is like the simplified version,</p>
<p>but when you produce estrogen, you are meant to use it,</p>
<p>like send it to the receptors where it&rsquo;s meant to go,</p>
<p>and then lose it.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t wanna keep recirculating estrogen</p>
<p>like bad karma, and that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>with people who have high beta-glucuronidase.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this enzyme that&rsquo;s produced by three bacteria</p>
<p>in particular in the gut.</p>
<p>And I see a lot of men and women</p>
<p>who have elevated beta-glucuronidase,</p>
<p>and then they have some estrogen dominance related to that.</p>
<p>Is that the total reason?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know, but it&rsquo;s one of the drivers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the levers.</p>
<p>And it can be detected from a microbiome,</p>
<p>aka stool sample.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And in terms of blood testing or various tests</p>
<p>for these other biomarkers,</p>
<p>getting estrogen, testosterone, and other ratios,</p>
<p>I realized people have different means, financial means,</p>
<p>but in general, people wanting to do a blood test,</p>
<p>it sounds like they&rsquo;re going to need to do it.</p>
<p>Women will need to do it</p>
<p>at different stages of their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>If they had to pick one,</p>
<p>either in the follicular phase or in the luteal stage</p>
<p>of their ovarian menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>excuse me, ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>when would you suggest they do that,</p>
<p>if they had to pick one?</p>
<p>So if you forced me to pick one,</p>
<p>I would say probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her 20s.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re focused right now on that decade.</p>
<p>So for most women, they&rsquo;ve got a menstrual cycle date</p>
<p>that averages out at 28 days.</p>
<p>So this is about a week before they start their period.</p>
<p>For women who are more regular, it&rsquo;s harder to do that.</p>
<p>As women get older, and we&rsquo;ll talk about this in a moment,</p>
<p>usually the cycle gets a little shorter.</p>
<p>So as they start to decline in their progesterone production,</p>
<p>their period gets a little closer together.</p>
<p>Like mine before August was about every 26 days.</p>
<p>So at that point, you want to test sooner, like day 19, 20.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about blood tests.</p>
<p>So a blood test is the cheapest thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually what&rsquo;s covered by insurance.</p>
<p>But my preference would be to do dried urine.</p>
<p>I like to use saliva for cortisol.</p>
<p>I like to use dried urine so that I get metabolomics</p>
<p>in addition to the levels of these hormones.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m forced to, I&rsquo;ll use blood testing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the gold standard</p>
<p>for all of these hormones that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not as comprehensive.</p>
<p>And as you know, it&rsquo;s a quick little snapshot</p>
<p>while the needle&rsquo;s in your vein for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah, the salivary cortisol makes sense to me</p>
<p>because my understanding is that you get free cortisol,</p>
<p>which is the active cortisol.</p>
<p>You said with urine, you&rsquo;re also getting the metabolites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then for blood testing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting sort of a crude window into the averages.</p>
<p>A static total level.</p>
<p>So let me go back and say one other thing about biomarkers.</p>
<p>A big part of the testing that I do</p>
<p>in phenotyping my patients, I practice precision medicine.</p>
<p>So I like to almost start with nutritional testing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a teenager.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some NBA players that are 19, 20, 21.</p>
<p>So maybe those count, but those are men, obviously.</p>
<p>But for nutritional testing,</p>
<p>that would be potentially a helpful thing to do</p>
<p>in your 20s.</p>
<p>Becomes less important as you get older</p>
<p>and you develop more micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>But micronutrients play a huge role</p>
<p>in terms of hormone production.</p>
<p>Magnesium.</p>
<p>Magnesium is hugely involved</p>
<p>in the way that you get rid of estrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>So micronutrient testing,</p>
<p>what I usually do is a combination of blood and urine.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m looking at all of the micronutrients</p>
<p>that we can measure</p>
<p>that have some clinical scientific basis behind them.</p>
<p>If I could do that for a teenager,</p>
<p>I think it might be helpful</p>
<p>because I recently gave a lecture</p>
<p>on breast cancer risk reduction.</p>
<p>Another quick sidebar.</p>
<p>And I was sad to find that intake of vegetables,</p>
<p>polyphenols, is such an important predictor</p>
<p>of future risk of breast cancer,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re 50, 60 plus.</p>
<p>And the most important time is when you&rsquo;re a teenager.</p>
<p>Now I have one daughter that eats vegetables.</p>
<p>She loves them.</p>
<p>And I have another daughter who eats food that&rsquo;s beige.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to get her to eat</p>
<p>the volume of vegetables,</p>
<p>five colors a day, which is what I do.</p>
<p>And if you have evidence</p>
<p>that you could show a 17-year-old</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve got micronutrient gaps,</p>
<p>I think that would be a motivator</p>
<p>for them to eat differently</p>
<p>at a time when it&rsquo;s so critical.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s 25 years in the future</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna potentially change this arc that they&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>What do you do for a young woman</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t like vegetables</p>
<p>or is not somehow able or willing</p>
<p>to get those five colors a day of vegetable</p>
<p>to help support the microbiome?</p>
<p>Are supplements a useful tool in that case?</p>
<p>What other sorts of tools,</p>
<p>behavioral or otherwise, are useful?</p>
<p>Such a good question.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m gonna invoke Rob Knight at UCSD.</p>
<p>So I think his gut project</p>
<p>has really been helpful</p>
<p>in terms of understanding</p>
<p>what kind of modulators are gonna be important.</p>
<p>So what I try to get that person to do,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see many teens anymore</p>
<p>other than MBA players,</p>
<p>what I try to get them to do is to have a smoothie.</p>
<p>Very hard to get them to have a smoothie every day.</p>
<p>But if I could get them to have a smoothie</p>
<p>three times a week</p>
<p>and to throw some of these vegetables in,</p>
<p>that makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that makes a difference</p>
<p>in terms of microbiome change.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be blending up broccoli or kale.</p>
<p>Cauliflower.</p>
<p>So cauliflower is great.</p>
<p>Even they&rsquo;re putting things into the smoothie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you can get a teenager to do that,</p>
<p>but they often will use,</p>
<p>like I have them do steamed broccoli that&rsquo;s in the freezer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got very little taste.</p>
<p>So that they could do that in a chocolate smoothie.</p>
<p>They could add some greens.</p>
<p>I like greens.</p>
<p>Powders are super convenient.</p>
<p>So that with kind of a taste that they like,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s chocolate,</p>
<p>which is what most of my clients want,</p>
<p>or vanilla with berries and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So that can go a long way if you don&rsquo;t like vegetables.</p>
<p>And short of that, I would say some supplements,</p>
<p>but I would say that&rsquo;s a distant second to making a smoothie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got one patient that I have to mention</p>
<p>because he took this to the extreme.</p>
<p>So he is a retired physicist professor at UCSD.</p>
<p>He found out that his microbiome was a hot mess</p>
<p>and developed autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>And so he became hell bent like only a physicist could</p>
<p>on changing his microbiome.</p>
<p>And he dramatically shifted it</p>
<p>by having a smoothie every day</p>
<p>with 57 vegetables and fruits in it.</p>
<p>57 independent.</p>
<p>57 independent.</p>
<p>So, I mean, this just warms my heart,</p>
<p>the way that he did this.</p>
<p>But he would go to the farmer&rsquo;s market,</p>
<p>he would just get a bunch of this, a bunch of that,</p>
<p>and he would go home, make the smoothie,</p>
<p>and then stick it in the freezer</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;d have a serving every day.</p>
<p>And he became a completely different person</p>
<p>based on this microbiome change.</p>
<p>His autoimmune disease is in remission.</p>
<p>He dropped a huge amount of weight.</p>
<p>He went from being kind of this phenotype</p>
<p>that I know you know well</p>
<p>of a professor, high-performing, traveling around the world</p>
<p>on so many boards, so much innovation,</p>
<p>so many great ideas, supercomputer guy,</p>
<p>to being someone who gets up in the morning,</p>
<p>gets in his hot tub, exercises for like one</p>
<p>to two hours a day, and then does a little work.</p>
<p>Like he completely shifted the way that he lives</p>
<p>and his microbiome shift.</p>
<p>Who knows what&rsquo;s the chicken and what&rsquo;s the egg there?</p>
<p>But he had a huge change in his physiology.</p>
<p>Glucose went from being quite high,</p>
<p>and he tracks all of this, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like on a Jupiter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And retired, I suppose, might have had.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s retired, but he&rsquo;s got the longest time series</p>
<p>of anyone I know.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s tracked his glucose and insulin</p>
<p>going back 20 years.</p>
<p>So he can show you, okay,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I started having my smoothie,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how my glucose and insulin changed</p>
<p>as a result of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains</p>
<p>a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals</p>
<p>that make sure that all of my foundational</p>
<p>nutritional needs are met.</p>
<p>And it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Is there a case for, I&rsquo;ll say young women,</p>
<p>but young women and men using over-the-counter probiotics</p>
<p>as a way to enhance the microbiome?</p>
<p>This is something I hear about a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that excessive doses of capsule probiotics</p>
<p>can give a brain fog-like condition.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t use capsule probiotics</p>
<p>unless I feel like my system&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under a significant amount of stress,</p>
<p>in which case I might add that in for brief periods of time,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;ve just taken antibiotics for a period of time.</p>
<p>Do you ever recommend that the college student</p>
<p>or the high school student</p>
<p>that she or he take capsule probiotics,</p>
<p>assuming that they&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say three to five servings of vegetables per day,</p>
<p>either in smoothie form or some other form?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on supplementing probiotics?</p>
<p>It sounds like such a simple question.</p>
<p>It is such a complex answer,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we really have the answer.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you the way that I approach it.</p>
<p>I look for randomized trials to support my use of probiotics.</p>
<p>And frankly, I&rsquo;m underwhelmed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen some data,</p>
<p>if I invoke my MBA players for a moment,</p>
<p>almost every player I&rsquo;ve tested</p>
<p>has increased intestinal permeability.</p>
<p>They just have such a high training load,</p>
<p>probably mediated by cortisol,</p>
<p>very high glucoses when they drain,</p>
<p>that they have increased intestinal permeability.</p>
<p>So those tight junctions in their intestine become loose.</p>
<p>They develop a lot of inflammation as a result of that.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re a professional MBA player</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making 20 million a year,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t want a lot of inflammation.</p>
<p>You want a little bit to like help your muscles recover,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want it to be adding to problems</p>
<p>when you develop an injury.</p>
<p>So this is leaky gut.</p>
<p>Leaky gut.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love that term, but yeah, we&rsquo;ll use it here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a particular probiotic</p>
<p>that is helpful in athletes with leaky gut.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of specificity and randomized trial</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>The rest of it, I think there&rsquo;s support</p>
<p>if you find help from it.</p>
<p>As you described, if you take a course of antibiotics,</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I would question whether you need them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a time and a place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been instances where they&rsquo;ve been prescribed</p>
<p>and I took them, mostly in the past.</p>
<p>I was in college.</p>
<p>They seemed like they kind of gave them out.</p>
<p>You had a sinus infection, they give you antibiotics.</p>
<p>Yeah, the worst treatment ever.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you&rsquo;re coming off of antibiotics,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good time to do</p>
<p>what we call replacement dose probiotics.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s far more interesting is prebiotics.</p>
<p>I think the data is much better for prebiotics</p>
<p>and the selective use of polyphenols.</p>
<p>How would a person in their teens and 20s</p>
<p>or any age for that matter,</p>
<p>know whether or not they have nutritional deficiencies?</p>
<p>What is the best way to analyze</p>
<p>if one is getting enough magnesium?</p>
<p>And for that matter,</p>
<p>what is going to be the best way to test the microbiome?</p>
<p>You said stool sample,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come right back with the same question I asked</p>
<p>about a blood test.</p>
<p>What time of day?</p>
<p>When during the month?</p>
<p>To establish a baseline.</p>
<p>So this would be prior to embarking on 97 vegetables</p>
<p>or how many per day.</p>
<p>I was only 57.</p>
<p>Well, I love the idea that you&rsquo;re telling us,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gathering correctly,</p>
<p>is that yes, there&rsquo;s a case for probiotics,</p>
<p>but for the typical person, regardless of age,</p>
<p>eating more vegetables or drinking more vegetables</p>
<p>as the case may be,</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial for the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>perhaps without the need to go test</p>
<p>whether or not one is making a certain number</p>
<p>of estrogen related metabolites or not.</p>
<p>Just that that&rsquo;s a great starting place,</p>
<p>eat or consume more vegetables.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>But if one wants to analyze their gut microbiome,</p>
<p>are there good tests available to the general public?</p>
<p>This has been, I&rsquo;m not going to name companies,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been tracking this over the years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never been clear to me that we know</p>
<p>what constituents of the gut microbiome are best.</p>
<p>We know that dysbiosis is bad</p>
<p>and we know that diversity of the microbiome is good.</p>
<p>We hear this, but no one&rsquo;s ever told me</p>
<p>that you want a particular ratio</p>
<p>of one microbiota to another</p>
<p>in a way that has made any sense to me, at least.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a microbiologist,</p>
<p>but whereas with testosterone in men,</p>
<p>we hear, okay, you want your free testosterone</p>
<p>to be about 2% of your total, perhaps.</p>
<p>With women, women are going to have more testosterone</p>
<p>than estrogen on average,</p>
<p>but still less than men when you look at testosterone,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But you can get some crude measures.</p>
<p>But for the microbiome,</p>
<p>it just seems like long lists of microbiota</p>
<p>for which I just get dizzy.</p>
<p>If you just wrote out a bunch of I&rsquo;s and L&rsquo;s and S&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d kind of halfway,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a bit the same information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to poke at that field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful field,</p>
<p>but they haven&rsquo;t told me what my microbiota</p>
<p>ought to look like.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a healthy microbiome chart?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, the best we have is Rob Knight&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>but even that is limited in terms of,</p>
<p>can I tell you that a woman in her 20s</p>
<p>should have this particular pattern with her microbiome?</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So let me go to your first question</p>
<p>because I think you just asked about sex.</p>
<p>Your first question is about nutritional testing.</p>
<p>What I like to do with nutritional testing</p>
<p>is run a panel that&rsquo;s looking at antioxidants,</p>
<p>so like vitamin A, vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid,</p>
<p>plant-based antioxidants,</p>
<p>because you can measure that in the blood.</p>
<p>I like to look at some of the key vitamins,</p>
<p>especially the B vitamin range,</p>
<p>because as you probably know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got particular genetic polymorphisms,</p>
<p>you might be less likely to be absorbing</p>
<p>the right level of vitamin B9, folate, vitamin B12, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also looking, going back to the antioxidants,</p>
<p>at glutathione,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s such an important lever</p>
<p>when it comes to detoxification,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t talked about yet.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m looking at some of the minerals.</p>
<p>Magnesium is really the most important,</p>
<p>and we know that somewhere around 70 to 80% of Americans</p>
<p>are deficient in magnesium.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the lowest hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I would be curious, for instance, like with magnesium,</p>
<p>if that number of people are deficient,</p>
<p>does that mean that that number of people</p>
<p>should be targeting their nutrition</p>
<p>towards foods that contain magnesium</p>
<p>and or supplementing with magnesium?</p>
<p>And if so, what forms of magnesium?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about Mag 3 and 8 for sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Mag Citrate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many forms.</p>
<p>It can be a little bit of overwhelming to people.</p>
<p>So any detail and sourcing, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Great, so first, in terms of testing,</p>
<p>what I prefer to do is to mention more than one lab</p>
<p>and more than one brand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m speaking mostly from experience.</p>
<p>So for testing, I do a lot of Genova neutrovalves.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, they developed an at-home test.</p>
<p>Normally with a neutrovalve, you have to get your blood drawn</p>
<p>and you have to do a urine sample.</p>
<p>So a lot of people can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The great thing about this test is your insurance</p>
<p>usually pays for most of it.</p>
<p>And so the copay is about $150.</p>
<p>So during the pandemic,</p>
<p>they developed another test called metabolomics,</p>
<p>which does much of the same testing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a finger prick.</p>
<p>So most of my patients prefer that.</p>
<p>In fact, they haven&rsquo;t gone back to the neutrovalve.</p>
<p>Second lab is SpectraCell.</p>
<p>I use SpectraCell occasionally.</p>
<p>I find it not quite as easy</p>
<p>in terms of fitting into my practice,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got friends and mentors like Mark Houston,</p>
<p>who does a lot of kind of precision</p>
<p>cardiometabolic health.</p>
<p>He thinks SpectraCell is the best test out there.</p>
<p>So you asked about magnesium.</p>
<p>You have to measure red blood cell magnesium,</p>
<p>like whole blood.</p>
<p>And with deficiency, it&rsquo;s interesting with supplementation.</p>
<p>For my patients who tend toward constipation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s frankly about 80% of the women</p>
<p>that I take care of.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious as to why that is.</p>
<p>I can guess, diet, stress.</p>
<p>Patriarchy, rage.</p>
<p>So psycho-</p>
<p>That they may not know about.</p>
<p>So pine, the-</p>
<p>The pine system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Psychology, immunology,</p>
<p>neural and endocrine factors combined, is that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then I would say there&rsquo;s another factor</p>
<p>which is being female is a health hazard.</p>
<p>So we have twice the rate of depression, insomnia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got three to four X increased risk</p>
<p>of multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got five to eight times</p>
<p>the risk of thyroid dysfunction.</p>
<p>So if you just look at that,</p>
<p>and you look at subtle preclinical thyroid dysfunction,</p>
<p>a huge number of the women that I take care of,</p>
<p>well, let me back off.</p>
<p>A large number of the women that I take care of</p>
<p>have thyroid dysfunction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contributing to constipation.</p>
<p>And if we go back to that control system,</p>
<p>the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal,</p>
<p>thyroid, genital, gut axis,</p>
<p>and they have a lot of perceived stress</p>
<p>together with this borderline thyroid function</p>
<p>that no mainstream medicine doctor</p>
<p>has told her is a problem.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;s got a problem with the tango</p>
<p>between estrogen and progesterone.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to tend toward constipation.</p>
<p>Women have a lot more constipation than men.</p>
<p>The gut is about 10 feet longer in women compared to men.</p>
<p>We should talk about some sex and gender differences</p>
<p>and define those.</p>
<p>And they are much more likely to have a torturous colon.</p>
<p>And the way you know that is you get a colonoscopy</p>
<p>and they tell you,</p>
<p>yeah, it was really hard to get in there</p>
<p>and do what we need to do.</p>
<p>As a brief tangent,</p>
<p>but I think this is the time to ask,</p>
<p>at what age now do physicians insist</p>
<p>their female patients get colonoscopies?</p>
<p>For men, I think the age used to be 50.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s getting ratcheted back to 45 or 40.</p>
<p>Again, these are recommendations, not requirements,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re pretty strong recommendations</p>
<p>depending on where you live, et cetera.</p>
<p>For women, how early do you think</p>
<p>they should get a colonoscopy to explore</p>
<p>for possible polyps and or colon cancer?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve always operated with is 50.</p>
<p>The way that I answer that</p>
<p>is to go to the U.S. Preventative Task Force rating</p>
<p>to determine based on their synthesis of the data</p>
<p>what age is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>Has it changed as you just described for men</p>
<p>from 50 to younger?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we should fact check that.</p>
<p>All these additional health hazards for women,</p>
<p>you mentioned some of the,</p>
<p>you broadly mentioned psychological impact, right?</p>
<p>And of course these things are all related,</p>
<p>psychology, immunology.</p>
<p>And one of the, I think, wonderful things</p>
<p>about neuroscience and science in general and medicine</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s now an understanding</p>
<p>that all the organs are connected to one another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a network.</p>
<p>And that the microbiome sits at a key node</p>
<p>within that network.</p>
<p>And I think most people accept that now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That seems to be a theme that,</p>
<p>at least in the last 10 years, is really wonderful</p>
<p>because certainly for neuroscience,</p>
<p>it was thought that unless it&rsquo;s in the cranial vault,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not neural, which is ridiculous</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of nervous system outside the skull.</p>
<p>But in any case-</p>
<p>Can I interrupt for a second?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re right that there&rsquo;s an understanding</p>
<p>about the network effect.</p>
<p>But I think that as much as I love mainstream medicine</p>
<p>and I trained in it and I&rsquo;m so grateful for my education,</p>
<p>I still think it is a silo-based way</p>
<p>of taking care of patients.</p>
<p>So even if there&rsquo;s an understanding of the network effect</p>
<p>more at the science level,</p>
<p>or as you described in neuroscience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still, if you are a woman</p>
<p>who has constipation, fatigue,</p>
<p>maybe an autoimmune condition,</p>
<p>feel stressed out all the time,</p>
<p>feel like your hormones are out of whack,</p>
<p>you get sent to the gastroenterologist</p>
<p>for the constipation,</p>
<p>you get sent to the rheumatologist</p>
<p>for your autoimmune issues,</p>
<p>you maybe get sent to an endocrinologist</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got thyroid problems,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s very little collaboration between these groups.</p>
<p>So even though there&rsquo;s an understanding</p>
<p>of the network effect in real life, it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go deeper down that path</p>
<p>because you point out something really important.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve mentioned constipation a few times.</p>
<p>Can we view constipation as a serious enough symptom</p>
<p>that it warrants an immediate intervention?</p>
<p>That is, does it flag or signal problems</p>
<p>that are severe enough that that should be the issue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dealt with for anybody that&rsquo;s experiencing it?</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of an odd topic for many people</p>
<p>because they think, oh, bowel movements,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that kind of pre-adolescent humor around this,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m hearing you say is that constipation</p>
<p>is far more common in women,</p>
<p>and it signals a general set of many problems occurring.</p>
<p>Does that mean that women should address constipation?</p>
<p>And if so, what&rsquo;s the best way to address constipation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love this question because you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>can we have a quick little meta conversation?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing something that I knew you would do,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re teaching me something,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re changing,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a social genomics thing happening</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re changing my thought about this.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I think for me, when I hear that there&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about a phenotype,</p>
<p>constipation is a phenotype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that people generally don&rsquo;t wear a T-shirt</p>
<p>explaining it to people,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;m guessing anything to do with sexual health,</p>
<p>bowel health, urology, people just don&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>for all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p>And those reasons are probably so obvious</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not even worth discussing,</p>
<p>also because we won&rsquo;t change them</p>
<p>except by talking about them.</p>
<p>So if you say women are far more constipated</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s signaling a larger set of problems,</p>
<p>then my immediate thought is,</p>
<p>well, will relieving constipation,</p>
<p>pun intended retroactively,</p>
<p>will that assist in a great number of issues</p>
<p>and or will it get them down the road</p>
<p>of thinking about those other issues more specifically?</p>
<p>Like, do I need more magnesium</p>
<p>or should I be putting vegetables in my smoothie?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious about constipation as a target</p>
<p>for intervention that then opens up</p>
<p>a bunch of other discussions,</p>
<p>because there are these certain nodes</p>
<p>in the mental health, physical health space</p>
<p>that when someone, like we talk a lot,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure, do I think it&rsquo;s magic?</p>
<p>No, but I think that if someone&rsquo;s getting themselves</p>
<p>into a cold shower once a day,</p>
<p>it opens up a number of questions about themselves</p>
<p>and reveals a number of things to themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how do I buffer stress?</p>
<p>What sorts of levels of control do I actually have?</p>
<p>And on and on.</p>
<p>So perhaps not the best example, but-</p>
<p>Some of us hate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Right, which is probably-</p>
<p>And we have like a gene that makes us stress out</p>
<p>like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe with cold exposure.</p>
<p>Which I would argue makes it very likely</p>
<p>that even 10 seconds of cold exposure</p>
<p>gets you the effect that you want.</p>
<p>As opposed to someone who adores cold exposure</p>
<p>like a penguin, needs a lot more cold exposure</p>
<p>for it to have the adaptive response.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my way of gumbing through that quite,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re quite correct.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s answer this question.</p>
<p>The constipation issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is how you&rsquo;re changing</p>
<p>the way I think about this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re asking, okay,</p>
<p>instead of looking at constipation</p>
<p>as a constellation of symptoms,</p>
<p>what about if you just used it on its own</p>
<p>as sort of a key indicator or signal</p>
<p>of dysfunction with the pine network</p>
<p>or maybe something broader?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it makes me think of a few things.</p>
<p>It makes me, you&rsquo;re also changing this book</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m writing on autoimmunity and trauma.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>So women experience more trauma than men.</p>
<p>This is well-established.</p>
<p>If you look at the ACE studies that were done</p>
<p>by the CDC and Kaiser in 1998,</p>
<p>we know that men for the most part,</p>
<p>middle-aged men have about 50% of them</p>
<p>experience significant trauma</p>
<p>as defined by the ACE questionnaire.</p>
<p>Women are at 60%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty durable since 1998.</p>
<p>So women have more.</p>
<p>They have different forms of abuse,</p>
<p>much more likely to have sexual abuse.</p>
<p>They have a different HPA response than men.</p>
<p>Their perceived stress tends to be higher,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m generalizing for a population.</p>
<p>Side note, in precision medicine, we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We do medicine for the individual,</p>
<p>not the population, not medicine for the average.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the physiology of a female,</p>
<p>I think that constipation and that need to like control</p>
<p>and restrain and hold things in,</p>
<p>you know, tighten the anal sphincter,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the physiology.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m veering away from the science,</p>
<p>but I do think that it is a really important signal</p>
<p>to pay a lot of attention to.</p>
<p>Now, you also asked about microbiome testing.</p>
<p>Should we do that or do you have one?</p>
<p>I have a couple more questions about constipation.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d ask this many questions</p>
<p>about constipation, but now I&rsquo;m fascinated.</p>
<p>By the way, also this morning,</p>
<p>I taught medical students at Stanford</p>
<p>about the fact that we are basically a series of tubes.</p>
<p>So you talked about the anal sphincter.</p>
<p>We are a set of sphincters from one end to the other.</p>
<p>I mean, we are a set of tubes,</p>
<p>a nervous system being one of those tubes.</p>
<p>And I think in Eastern medicine,</p>
<p>they talk about the various locks</p>
<p>between those tubes and chambers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not without coincidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some real wisdom there, of course.</p>
<p>Wait, did you just talk about energetic anatomy?</p>
<p>More or less.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say the word chakras, but I might in passing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the bondas that you are questioning.</p>
<p>The bondas, right, are the sphincters, right?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>So what defines constipation?</p>
<p>I mean, in other words, let&rsquo;s think about the healthy,</p>
<p>rather than think about the unhealthy,</p>
<p>how many bowel movements should a woman</p>
<p>or a man have per day, assuming,</p>
<p>and this is where it gets tricky</p>
<p>because some people are doing time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Some people are eating more.</p>
<p>Some people are eating more fiber, more bulk,</p>
<p>larger meal at the end of the day,</p>
<p>a larger meal at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>We will never be able to sort out all those variables,</p>
<p>but on average, how many bowel movements</p>
<p>and is timing during the day</p>
<p>for bowel movements at all informative?</p>
<p>What works for you?</p>
<p>Well, when I&rsquo;m asleep,</p>
<p>generally I don&rsquo;t want a bowel movement.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to be like most people, right?</p>
<p>Well, sleep is primary for you.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>I always assumed that morning time</p>
<p>was a healthy time for bowel movements.</p>
<p>And I think almost everybody, babies included,</p>
<p>recognize the feeling of being lighter and more energetic</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve evacuated their colon.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that I&rsquo;m obsessed</p>
<p>with Jungian and Freudian psychology</p>
<p>that the first thing we learn</p>
<p>when we come into this world, right,</p>
<p>is that we want something,</p>
<p>we feel some sort of autonomic arousal stress,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s food or warmth</p>
<p>or the need to have a bowel movement.</p>
<p>And one of the first things that parents learn</p>
<p>is how to recognize that,</p>
<p>not by the odor coming from the diaper,</p>
<p>but by the look on the baby&rsquo;s face or their agitation.</p>
<p>Agitation signals the need for some sort of relief, right?</p>
<p>Temperature relief, food relief,</p>
<p>evacuating the bowel relief.</p>
<p>So my understanding is that as autonomic arousal</p>
<p>increases in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>ideally after a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>that bowel movements become more likely,</p>
<p>unless that arousal becomes so great</p>
<p>that then people feel so quote-unquote locked up</p>
<p>because of the balance of the autonomic features.</p>
<p>So early day, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>and again in the second half of the day,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m totally guessing,</p>
<p>and certainly not having to wake</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are my best guesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So I would agree with that.</p>
<p>When I was at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>and UCSF for residency,</p>
<p>I was taught that constipation</p>
<p>is having a bowel movement less frequently</p>
<p>than once every three days.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever laughed out loud</p>
<p>on this podcast as a consequence</p>
<p>of textbook medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Is that ridiculous?</p>
<p>Well, that sounds like, and here pun intended,</p>
<p>that sounds like the conclusion of some very-</p>
<p>Constipated person. Emotionally</p>
<p>and in other ways, constipated individuals.</p>
<p>And again, this might seem like an odd conversation,</p>
<p>but the discussion around constipation</p>
<p>is present in psychological literature</p>
<p>because of this relationship to the autonomic system.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a metaphor in literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial.</p>
<p>So you spoke to a number of different threads</p>
<p>that I think are important here.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the definition that I learned.</p>
<p>And I heard that and I was like,</p>
<p>hell no, that doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone I know.</p>
<p>And I spent a lot of time,</p>
<p>especially in medical school and in my internship,</p>
<p>where you rotate on medicine,</p>
<p>disimpacting women, like older women who come in</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t had a bowel movement in a month.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, that is not nice for anybody.</p>
<p>Believe me, I became a scientist and a physician</p>
<p>for a number of reasons, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So my definition of constipation</p>
<p>as a Western, mostly white girl,</p>
<p>is that if you&rsquo;re not having a bowel movement</p>
<p>every single morning</p>
<p>and you have a feeling of complete evacuation,</p>
<p>anything less than that is constipation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I define it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in India and you&rsquo;re eating food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a fair amount of microbes in it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less sanitary, I&rsquo;m using that word</p>
<p>as carefully as I can.</p>
<p>Generally, they have a bowel movement after every meal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve got a different microbiome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re exposed to different microbes.</p>
<p>Here in the US, I would say once a day.</p>
<p>You also spoke to something very important,</p>
<p>which is the balance</p>
<p>between the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>rest and digest and poop,</p>
<p>versus the sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>kind of the on button, you know,</p>
<p>fight, flight, freeze, spawn.</p>
<p>So I think for those of us</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve got issues with autonomic balance,</p>
<p>it can lead to constipation.</p>
<p>And I like that constipation could be pulled out</p>
<p>and kind of writ larger as an important signal.</p>
<p>What sorts of tools do you recommend people use</p>
<p>to relieve constipation?</p>
<p>In eating more fiber,</p>
<p>it sounds like reducing stress is going to be a huge one.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What are your favorite stress reduction tools?</p>
<p>I like to divide these into real time tools.</p>
<p>So big proponent of like physiological sighing,</p>
<p>real time, you know, these sorts of things,</p>
<p>but things that can really lower the baseline</p>
<p>on stress overall to facilitate constipation</p>
<p>and other broad indicators of health.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a fan of lowering stress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of lowering perceived stress.</p>
<p>And I think the distinction is really important.</p>
<p>I learned when I was in my 30s</p>
<p>that I was a massive stress case and I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>It was just sort of, I think I, through residency,</p>
<p>through working 120 hours a week,</p>
<p>I just was so accustomed and sort of-</p>
<p>That was 120, not under 20 folks.</p>
<p>Yeah, not unusual in medicine.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve changed training</p>
<p>so that you work no more than 80 hours a week now,</p>
<p>but that was before my time.</p>
<p>So I became accustomed</p>
<p>to a massive amount of cortisol, massive.</p>
<p>And I would say I&rsquo;ve spent the past 20 years</p>
<p>really working on perceived stress to find,</p>
<p>I think all of us need an a la carte menu</p>
<p>of what is most effective.</p>
<p>So what works for me now at my age is different</p>
<p>than the TM I did as a college student,</p>
<p>transcendental meditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than the,</p>
<p>I became a certified yoga teacher when I was in my 30s.</p>
<p>That is very effective for a lot of people.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough for my matrix.</p>
<p>I do holotropic breath work.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read it,</p>
<p>but I saw that you just had a paper in cell on your sign.</p>
<p>And it made me think like,</p>
<p>teach me how to sigh, teach me how to sigh.</p>
<p>Can you say a little bit about that?</p>
<p>Like, how do you do it?</p>
<p>Yeah, very briefly,</p>
<p>that study was we wanted to find</p>
<p>a minimal effective dose intervention.</p>
<p>Yeah, five minutes.</p>
<p>So I just wanted, yeah, so five minutes a day.</p>
<p>We needed to figure out what people do every day.</p>
<p>And we were monitoring subjective mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also biometrics remotely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a nice study.</p>
<p>Which biometrics?</p>
<p>HRV, nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>Cortisol?</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>So this was done during the pandemic,</p>
<p>more than a hundred subjects.</p>
<p>The advantage was that we got data 24 hours a day</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re pinging us in their data.</p>
<p>Wearing-</p>
<p>HRV 24?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So that was nice.</p>
<p>Resting heart rate,</p>
<p>subjective mood, we would get in touch with them daily.</p>
<p>So when people were swapped between groups,</p>
<p>like any good study,</p>
<p>but five minutes a day of sort of standard, if you will,</p>
<p>forgive me, meditations or just sitting,</p>
<p>no instructions about how to breathe,</p>
<p>just focusing on closing their eyes</p>
<p>and focusing on focusing.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Another group did box breathing.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations.</p>
<p>The duration of each of those inhales and holds</p>
<p>was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance.</p>
<p>So somewhere between three and eight seconds,</p>
<p>depending on how well they regulate to carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Another group did cyclic sighing.</p>
<p>So this would be double inhale through the nose.</p>
<p>So big inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>followed by a, to lungs, empty exhale.</p>
<p>That second inhale after the first big long inhale</p>
<p>through the nose is really important</p>
<p>because it makes sure that all the collapsed avioli lungs</p>
<p>snap open.</p>
<p>And then the exhale, you offload a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very similar to holotropic breath work.</p>
<p>Yes, not unlike holotropic breath work,</p>
<p>little bit pranayama-ish,</p>
<p>but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active.</p>
<p>And then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>which is a lot like tummo, aka Wim Hof-ish breathing,</p>
<p>different than Wim Hof breathing.</p>
<p>So this would be, so very active inhales and exhales.</p>
<p>Every 25 cycles of inhale, exhale, that would be one cycle.</p>
<p>Long exhale, hold lungs empty, 15 to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>then repeat for about five minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone did that for five minutes.</p>
<p>And what we found was that the cyclic sighing</p>
<p>led to the greatest improvements in mood around the clock,</p>
<p>not just around the practice or during the practice,</p>
<p>as well as lowered resting heart rate,</p>
<p>improvements in sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you got it published in Cell, that&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were very fortunate.</p>
<p>I think that thankfully the reviewers and editors</p>
<p>understood that these minimal intervention things</p>
<p>hopefully are gonna be of use to people.</p>
<p>So useful to people.</p>
<p>I mean, how often do you read a paper like that</p>
<p>that could offer a behavior change</p>
<p>that is so easy to implement?</p>
<p>I mean, I love that question.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So what about, did you tell them not to drink</p>
<p>because alcohol has such a huge effect on HRV?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in this case,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t tell them to alter anything else</p>
<p>about their behavior.</p>
<p>Just hoping it was background</p>
<p>kind of across the same allegory.</p>
<p>Yes, and some were Stanford students,</p>
<p>others were from the general population.</p>
<p>Any frat boys that were drinking heavily?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Well, during the pandemic,</p>
<p>I think alcohol intake went way up across the board.</p>
<p>I mean, if I had a magic wand,</p>
<p>I would ask that people either not drink</p>
<p>or drink two drinks per week maximum.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s my understanding of the literature.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the WHOOP data with alcohol?</p>
<p>No, but we have a collaboration with WHOOP</p>
<p>through that paper.</p>
<p>And it certainly disrupts patterns of nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>In particular, from my understanding,</p>
<p>that first phase of sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to the massive growth hormone release</p>
<p>that we all really need and want in that person.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t measure growth hormone?</p>
<p>We did not.</p>
<p>No, the second iteration of this study</p>
<p>will certainly include free cortisol by saliva.</p>
<p>A hormone panel?</p>
<p>Yeah, a hormone panel.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m beginning to think that we should also</p>
<p>be asking people how often they&rsquo;re going to the bathroom</p>
<p>and what time of day.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, this thing around constipation is super interesting.</p>
<p>And I think that plus blood markers,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m very excited to learn</p>
<p>that urine contains additional markers</p>
<p>that could be informative.</p>
<p>So yeah, it was a fun study,</p>
<p>not easy study to do with that number of subjects.</p>
<p>Takes a lot of training for your research assistants.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a big group.</p>
<p>It was nine people in our group and three clinicians</p>
<p>and a lot of phone calls and a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>And thank you to the subjects</p>
<p>who served as the real life guinea pigs.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that stress,</p>
<p>I think people are starting to appreciate</p>
<p>that there are ways that they can relieve their stress</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t only fall under the categories</p>
<p>of vacation and meditation.</p>
<p>But I want to say that meditation</p>
<p>is obviously a wonderful tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a tool not unlike any other tool</p>
<p>that is great for some people and less great for others.</p>
<p>Well, certainly it&rsquo;s a great tool</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got such a scientific basis behind it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many things on this a la carte menu.</p>
<p>Sex, orgasm, connection, feeling heard and seen and loved.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier that all these stress factors,</p>
<p>you said patriarchy, right?</p>
<p>But I think what, if I may,</p>
<p>at risk of just strengthening that statement,</p>
<p>I mean, that to me is signaling a bunch of other factors</p>
<p>around, as you said, like keeping things in</p>
<p>what do you think explains, let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>Because I think that that&rsquo;s likely to have raised</p>
<p>a certain flag in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>Like, what exactly is she talking about?</p>
<p>Are you talking about less opportunity?</p>
<p>Are you talking about less opportunity to vocalize?</p>
<p>Are you talking about less opportunity</p>
<p>to vocalize and be heard?</p>
<p>I mean, I realize that there are an infinite number</p>
<p>of variables, but given that it sounds like</p>
<p>a really strong input to the system,</p>
<p>what I mean by that is that psychology</p>
<p>is influencing biology.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that these power dynamics,</p>
<p>structures and dynamics are impacting it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to, let&rsquo;s hear your thoughts on that</p>
<p>because I hate to let a flag like that go by</p>
<p>without fleshing it out.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Never waste a good flag.</p>
<p>Well, and let&rsquo;s preface it by just saying that</p>
<p>like people will have different opinions on this</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>And like with the discussion about constipation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about what people aren&rsquo;t willing to talk about</p>
<p>when it comes to health.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>So we might need to talk about patriarchy on part two,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you some material that I&rsquo;ve been working with.</p>
<p>I started, I did not even understand the existence</p>
<p>of patriarchy until I was a bioengineering undergraduate.</p>
<p>At MIT, I should mention.</p>
<p>Which has always had a bit of a male,</p>
<p>a skewed male in terms of faculty numbers.</p>
<p>Well, my-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true at most universities.</p>
<p>True, well, my postdoc advisor was the late Ben Barris,</p>
<p>who was a female to male transition, transgender.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>First transgender member</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>one of my closest friends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he died of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>We were very, very close.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually making a documentary about Ben.</p>
<p>But Ben, this is interesting,</p>
<p>Ben went to MIT because he wanted to be around a lot of men.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lesser known fact.</p>
<p>But then he was a very strong advocate for women.</p>
<p>He went as Barbara when he was Barbara.</p>
<p>And by the way, he&rsquo;s given me permission to share all this.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Prior to his death,</p>
<p>I recorded a lot of conversations with Ben.</p>
<p>I only ever knew him as Ben, by the way.</p>
<p>But when he was at MIT, he was identified female.</p>
<p>And he later talked about the intense suppression,</p>
<p>oppression, literally is how he described it.</p>
<p>Especially given that he was performing so well.</p>
<p>Yes, so you just defined patriarchy.</p>
<p>You did it yourself.</p>
<p>Couple things.</p>
<p>When I was in bioengineering,</p>
<p>I took a women&rsquo;s studies class.</p>
<p>And it was all about teaching undergraduates</p>
<p>about the existence of patriarchy.</p>
<p>Which I would define maybe at its simplest as power over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying men are patriarchy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying something very different, which is power over.</p>
<p>Let me correct one thing that she said.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to MIT as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m from, I was in Alaska</p>
<p>and I went to the University of Washington</p>
<p>for bioengineering.</p>
<p>In Seattle.</p>
<p>In Seattle.</p>
<p>I dropped out of a graduate program in bioengineering</p>
<p>to go to the Harvard-MIT program</p>
<p>for health sciences and technology in Boston.</p>
<p>Thanks for that clarification.</p>
<p>University of Washington, also wonderful place.</p>
<p>I have many, many, many, many, many,</p>
<p>wonderful close colleagues there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible place, especially for vision science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially good for engineering, bioengineering.</p>
<p>But yeah, so my MD is jointly between MIT and Harvard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the oldest, maybe largest,</p>
<p>although Harvard says this a lot,</p>
<p>program for biomedical engineers</p>
<p>and MD-PhDs, Physician Scientist Training Program.</p>
<p>Great, thanks for that clarification.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna blame the internet for this one.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>We need to send our Wikipedia editors out.</p>
<p>I think LinkedIn is correct.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Well, Wikipedia editors, note,</p>
<p>get out there and make the correction.</p>
<p>Now you heard it.</p>
<p>So stress that is,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really talking about is systemic stress</p>
<p>in the body as a consequence, excuse me,</p>
<p>of systemic stress of environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s particular forms of it.</p>
<p>I would say this also relates to white privilege.</p>
<p>It relates to racism.</p>
<p>And when you look at kind of the way that systems,</p>
<p>including my beloved MIT,</p>
<p>the way that they&rsquo;re set up is that might makes right.</p>
<p>And generally the people that are the strongest,</p>
<p>big men, strong men,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who tend to be the most successful.</p>
<p>So for people who are BIPOC,</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t have white privilege,</p>
<p>for women, it&rsquo;s a different experience.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m using patriarchy as kind of a umbrella here,</p>
<p>but it connects to many other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids and hormones and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate</p>
<p>and indeed optimal for you.</p>

<p>I want to use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to A, keep this in mind as we turn to a question</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t close the hatch on earlier</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s my fault,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m now clear on the fact</p>
<p>that a woman in her late teens, early 20s</p>
<p>ought to know something about her testosterone,</p>
<p>estrogen, thyroid, cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Should start at least thinking about her microbiome.</p>
<p>Should be thinking about how many bowel movements</p>
<p>and the timing of those bowel movements per day, really.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m assuming that what I just described</p>
<p>is also true for women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s,</p>
<p>on up to hundreds.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, but I would say</p>
<p>that there are differential opportunities by decade.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s circled it back</p>
<p>to teenagers and testosterone</p>
<p>because I think if you know, for instance,</p>
<p>in your teenage years that you have high androgens</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve got this potential phenotype</p>
<p>way into the future that you may not even notice.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you notice you&rsquo;ve got a few extra hairs</p>
<p>on your chin or something.</p>
<p>If you know that your testosterone is elevated</p>
<p>or some other androgen, it might change the arc</p>
<p>of how you take care of yourself.</p>
<p>So I think that could be very helpful in your teenage years.</p>
<p>In your 20s, for people who are a stress case like me,</p>
<p>so age 27 on the wards at UCSF,</p>
<p>if I had known that I was such a high cortisol person,</p>
<p>I think I would have done things differently.</p>
<p>I would have changed my behavior.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know because I didn&rsquo;t base case these,</p>
<p>but your testosterone can decline starting in your 20s,</p>
<p>kind of depending on how much stress your matrix is under.</p>
<p>So for women that can start as early as 28,</p>
<p>usually your testosterone declines by about 1% per year.</p>
<p>What level of testosterone do you like to see in a woman</p>
<p>once she&rsquo;s post, let&rsquo;s say after age 25,</p>
<p>what kind of range is healthy?</p>
<p>I know what the reference range is only</p>
<p>because I know one could look it up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it off the top of my head admittedly.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s a kind of a nice reference point there?</p>
<p>So the way I tend to describe this on podcasts</p>
<p>is the top half of the normal range.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So that I think is a good benchmark.</p>
<p>You know, for PCOS, generally it&rsquo;s much higher than that.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve seen patients with PCOS</p>
<p>where their total testosterone is 100 to 200.</p>
<p>Do they always have peripheral manifestations of that?</p>
<p>A little bit of hair, the skin plaques I&rsquo;ve heard about,</p>
<p>you know, so darkened skin plaques.</p>
<p>Irregular periods.</p>
<p>Irregular periods.</p>
<p>Is that, you know, I get a lot of questions about PCOS.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re the first person we&rsquo;ve had on this podcast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really qualified to talk about PCOS in a real way.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re talking about too many androgens,</p>
<p>cysts on the ovary, irregular ovarian, excuse me,</p>
<p>I keep saying that, ovulatory slash menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>What are some other indicators?</p>
<p>And do you recommend that women</p>
<p>start taking androgen blockers or, I mean,</p>
<p>how does, it seems to be a lot of PCOS out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing about it a lot.</p>
<p>So glad you asked about this.</p>
<p>So PCOS is one of those really poorly understood conditions</p>
<p>that gets, it kind of flies below the radar</p>
<p>until a woman wants to get pregnant</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s got some other issue</p>
<p>that drives her to a physician.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is a syndrome, right?</p>
<p>So polycystic ovary syndrome,</p>
<p>sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome,</p>
<p>and syndromes don&rsquo;t necessarily fit together</p>
<p>into a really clear diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>So in this instance,</p>
<p>there are three different criteria that we look for.</p>
<p>So cysts on the ovaries,</p>
<p>having clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism.</p>
<p>So that could be hirsutism, acne, other things,</p>
<p>and then usually irregular periods.</p>
<p>And the way that that&rsquo;s defined,</p>
<p>at least by the latest criteria,</p>
<p>is having a period every 35 days or less.</p>
<p>So typical cycle length, 28 days, 35 days,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re skipping a period here and there.</p>
<p>So those are the criteria that we use to diagnose PCOS.</p>
<p>There are about four different systems out there</p>
<p>in the literature for diagnosing PCOS,</p>
<p>which is where it starts to get confusing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some women who have no cysts on their ovaries,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve got hirsutism,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got irregular periods.</p>
<p>Could you define hirsutism?</p>
<p>Hirsutism is increased hair growth,</p>
<p>usually in places that you don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>So for women, it can be, you know, kind of male pattern.</p>
<p>They might notice it on their breasts, on their chest.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, of course, a familial quality to that.</p>
<p>Like I was just looking at a paper last night,</p>
<p>looking at Israelis and how much hirsutism they have,</p>
<p>and whether this is related to CAG repeats</p>
<p>on the androgen receptor.</p>
<p>Do they get, not Israelis,</p>
<p>but do women who might have PCOS experience</p>
<p>androgenic alopecia, so hair loss,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the quote unquote male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s androgen pattern baldness</p>
<p>as opposed to male,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about testosterone, DHT related.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, this is where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna invoke clinical experience</p>
<p>rather than what I&rsquo;ve seen in the literature.</p>
<p>Women definitely can have some androgenic alopecia.</p>
<p>I tend to see it later in life.</p>
<p>But this is an important point,</p>
<p>because we think of PCOS as, you know,</p>
<p>I was just talking about it in teenage years.</p>
<p>Like, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to know</p>
<p>that you have this phenotype and you&rsquo;re at risk</p>
<p>for all the things that people are at risk for?</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t talked about glucose and insulin yet.</p>
<p>We should.</p>
<p>What we know is that PCOS is not just a problem</p>
<p>in terms of irregular periods</p>
<p>and then difficulty getting pregnant.</p>
<p>So those are mostly problems in your 20s, 30s, early 40s,</p>
<p>but it is a massive risk factor</p>
<p>for cardiometabolic disease as you get older.</p>
<p>So many people tend to pigeonhole PCOS</p>
<p>as a problem of reproductive age.</p>
<p>We have to be thinking of it</p>
<p>over the entire female life cycle.</p>
<p>And I would say it&rsquo;s even more important</p>
<p>to consider it over the age of 50,</p>
<p>you know, average age of menopause is 51 to 52,</p>
<p>because we know that that elevated testosterone,</p>
<p>the high androgens, are probably the greatest</p>
<p>cardiometabolic driver of disease for women with PCOS.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Now, one other thing I wanna mention,</p>
<p>and I still have my notes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna talk about microbiome testing,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such a fun subject.</p>
<p>What I was taught to do,</p>
<p>again, saying this with so much love</p>
<p>for the people who have taught me how to do medicine.</p>
<p>What I was taught to do is that</p>
<p>if you have a woman with PCOS,</p>
<p>you make the diagnosis, you measure her testosterone,</p>
<p>you see if she has acne, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>You ask that woman one question.</p>
<p>Do you wanna get pregnant or not?</p>
<p>So then you have these women with PCOS</p>
<p>who get started on a birth control pill</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t wanna get pregnant.</p>
<p>If they wanna get pregnant,</p>
<p>then you help them get pregnant</p>
<p>by addressing some of these PCOS issues,</p>
<p>like maybe you give them Clomid,</p>
<p>or you do something to make them ovulate more frequently.</p>
<p>That is the way that most conventional medicine</p>
<p>approaches this, and it does women a gigantic disservice.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;m speaking into</p>
<p>is the gender gap that exists.</p>
<p>So my feeling is that the research money</p>
<p>that goes into women&rsquo;s health is abysmal</p>
<p>compared to what goes into men&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s changing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a huge lack of awareness</p>
<p>of sex and gender differences</p>
<p>when it comes to the way that we construct</p>
<p>clinical trials and other experiments.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve sat on NIH review panels</p>
<p>for more than a decade now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a regular standing member,</p>
<p>which is only to say that I see the research</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s being proposed.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s required, no grant will get funded</p>
<p>without sex as a biological variable.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m, by the way, folks,</p>
<p>this is sex, biological sex, the noun, not sex, the verb.</p>
<p>Both are super interesting, obviously.</p>
<p>But when we say sex as a biological variable,</p>
<p>meaning even if it&rsquo;s a study on mice-</p>
<p>Where did that start, though?</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t start that long ago.</p>
<p>It must&rsquo;ve been, I think we can thank,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to misattribute here.</p>
<p>I think we can thank Francis Collins</p>
<p>for insisting on this.</p>
<p>Amen, Francis.</p>
<p>And Bernadine Healy.</p>
<p>Bernadine Healy has done so much to help us,</p>
<p>but she made the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative,</p>
<p>which I hope we&rsquo;ll get to, which is a hot mess.</p>
<p>So confusing, the data that came out of that.</p>
<p>Yes, and these trials are long,</p>
<p>and so the data are only now starting to emerge.</p>
<p>So just to be clear, I mean, I have a question</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think is going to take us off track,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to pose this question as a hypothesis</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s likely to be a little bit of a,</p>
<p>not a barbed wire question,</p>
<p>but maybe like a prickly question when people first hear it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s posed as a hypothesis.</p>
<p>You mentioned some of the psychosocial stress issues</p>
<p>based on, at the organizational level,</p>
<p>institutional level, societal level,</p>
<p>maybe right down to the family and just life,</p>
<p>that are biasing health outcomes for the worse</p>
<p>in female populations, okay?</p>
<p>You refer to it as the patriarchy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to make sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re both talking about the same thing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s non-exhaustive, I realize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a subset of the issues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hearing there&rsquo;s a lot more PCOS,</p>
<p>which is hyperandrogenization of the ovary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, you mentioned it,</p>
<p>excess testosterone, which females naturally</p>
<p>have more testosterone than they do estrogen anyway,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking about elevated levels.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a hypothesis.</p>
<p>One hypothesis would be that the increased androgens</p>
<p>and the PCOS are a consequence</p>
<p>of the psychosocial conditions that are,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say forcing,</p>
<p>but are biasing the need for females</p>
<p>to think, behave, react, act in certain ways</p>
<p>to survive, let alone thrive.</p>
<p>Is that a, I don&rsquo;t say this</p>
<p>for any kind of political correctness hypothesis.</p>
<p>This is a, in my, this would be a fun, interesting,</p>
<p>and I think important study to run, right?</p>
<p>Depending on stress and the conditions,</p>
<p>the specific type of stress,</p>
<p>do females underproduce or overproduce androgens,</p>
<p>or is it a neutral effect?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>I love this question.</p>
<p>So let me just paraphrase the last part of it</p>
<p>to make sure I got it.</p>
<p>It sounds like what you&rsquo;re asking is,</p>
<p>could PCOS or at least some phenotypes of PCOS</p>
<p>be a response to what I&rsquo;m calling patriarchy?</p>
<p>And then you add a second part to it,</p>
<p>which is, do healthy women,</p>
<p>like what is their production of testosterone like?</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes, and with the acknowledgement,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re the expert here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the physician, clinician, and expert in hormones,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, but with the understanding</p>
<p>that absolute levels of hormones are interesting,</p>
<p>but perhaps not as interesting</p>
<p>as the ratios of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re talking about excess testosterone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really not talking about,</p>
<p>oh, women making a lot of testosterone</p>
<p>because frankly, they already make a lot.</p>
<p>Then most people weren&rsquo;t aware of that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that women make more testosterone</p>
<p>than estrogen.</p>
<p>And we need it.</p>
<p>Right, and so it&rsquo;s not saying</p>
<p>that testosterone in women is bad</p>
<p>or is always a reaction to the environment,</p>
<p>but when it becomes super physiological or hyper elevated</p>
<p>is I could imagine all sorts of social conditions</p>
<p>that would create that, so in males and females,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re talking about PCOS</p>
<p>and females in particular.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love for you to speculate.</p>
<p>Should we run the study?</p>
<p>We should totally run the study</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>I suspect that you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>It may not explain all of the women with PCOS</p>
<p>because as I mentioned, there&rsquo;s a lot of different phenotypes</p>
<p>but I think it could explain a significant portion.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re almost, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>if we look at the gene environment interface,</p>
<p>this environmental influence of having,</p>
<p>being someone who&rsquo;s got power over you,</p>
<p>if PCOS was a response to that,</p>
<p>the way that we treat it would be completely different.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, I wanna be careful</p>
<p>not to dismiss the suffering and experience</p>
<p>of women with PCOS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of women with PCOS in my family</p>
<p>and it is, there&rsquo;s so much pain and suffering,</p>
<p>especially if you wanna have a baby</p>
<p>and you try for years and you just can&rsquo;t ovulate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I read a paper recently</p>
<p>and maybe we could cite this,</p>
<p>that compares the phenotype of a woman with PCOS</p>
<p>to a man who is hypoandrogenic.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting way to look at this</p>
<p>because the thread we haven&rsquo;t talked about with PCOS</p>
<p>is the role of insulin and glucose.</p>
<p>So for some of the phenotypes of PCOS,</p>
<p>the problem is hyperinsulinemia,</p>
<p>high insulin in the blood,</p>
<p>is driving those theca cells in the ovaries</p>
<p>to overproduce testosterone.</p>
<p>These women are insulin insensitive,</p>
<p>so more insulin&rsquo;s being cranked out</p>
<p>and the cells in the ovary are therefore</p>
<p>making more androgen.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like to say insulin resistant?</p>
<p>Oh, I can, I don&rsquo;t have a problem saying insulin resistant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a little bit outside the lane lines</p>
<p>of my expertise, so I was trying to use that.</p>
<p>What is the correct nomenclature</p>
<p>so that we can make sure we&rsquo;re on course?</p>
<p>Well, what I like about insulin insensitive,</p>
<p>the way that she just said it,</p>
<p>is that I think that offers people a way in</p>
<p>and I love to do that in terms of messaging.</p>
<p>Insulin resistance starts to lose people</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t really get what that means</p>
<p>at a receptor level.</p>
<p>I think I say insulin insensitive</p>
<p>because when people hear insulin sensitive,</p>
<p>it almost sounds like a bad thing,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually what you want.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s how I defaulted to insulin insensitive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your insulin?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m due for a blood test.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m due for a blood test.</p>
<p>I had blood work done about eight months.</p>
<p>Can I interpret it?</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always experimenting with different supplements</p>
<p>and different behavioral regimens</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve kept charts since I was 19.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re like my patient.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sort of obsessed by this</p>
<p>and I would say everybody, if you can afford it,</p>
<p>and at the time, actually, I had to save up,</p>
<p>insurance wouldn&rsquo;t cover it,</p>
<p>get some basic blood work done</p>
<p>so that you have a reference point.</p>
<p>Do it as soon as possible</p>
<p>because even, we&rsquo;ve been talking about these women</p>
<p>over the life cycle.</p>
<p>I wish I knew what my insulin was when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>I wish I knew what my fasting insulin was.</p>
<p>I really wish I knew my postprandial insulin</p>
<p>like in my teenage years, in my 20s, in my 30s.</p>
<p>Well, I knew it at my 30s, starting at 35.</p>
<p>Are you a fan of continuous glucose monitors?</p>
<p>The hugest, most gigantic fan of CGMs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any tool that I&rsquo;ve ever used in medicine</p>
<p>change behavior the way that CGMs do.</p>
<p>Wow, why do you think they are so effective</p>
<p>at changing behavior?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried one and I really liked it.</p>
<p>I learned that in the sauna, my insulin,</p>
<p>my blood glucose goes up probably by a bit of dehydration.</p>
<p>I learned what kind of foods work for me, which don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I thought it was fascinating.</p>
<p>I learned how every behavior you could possibly imagine,</p>
<p>use your imagination, impacts blood glucose.</p>
<p>It was totally fascinating to me,</p>
<p>including how two wake-ups during the middle of the night</p>
<p>versus one versus none impacted blood glucose</p>
<p>the next morning.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>For a data junkie like me, it was like, I was in heaven.</p>
<p>Why do you think they are so effective</p>
<p>in changing behavior?</p>
<p>Is it because of that, that people can see</p>
<p>that real-time control, like scan in and like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s the sandwich glucose?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s many things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s generally the enchantment</p>
<p>of learning about your own chemistry and biology.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I think for me, what I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>I feel like doctors are basically marketers,</p>
<p>like a sacred marketing.</p>
<p>Our job as a physician is to convince people</p>
<p>to do something that we think is good for them</p>
<p>based on the best science, but we can&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>here, why don&rsquo;t you fill this prescription for OCGM?</p>
<p>You have to market it.</p>
<p>You have to say, I think this completely changes</p>
<p>the way that you approach your prediabetes.</p>
<p>I think this could dramatically affect</p>
<p>your risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so worried about that your mother has.</p>
<p>So our job as physicians is to be that sacred marketer.</p>
<p>So CGMs are one of my tools that I think are so crucial.</p>
<p>So enchantment, number two, yeah, it&rsquo;s the real-time effect.</p>
<p>So if you go get your glucose and insulin measured,</p>
<p>or maybe you do like a two-hour glucose challenge test</p>
<p>where you look at glucose and insulin</p>
<p>at the fasting point one hour later,</p>
<p>two hours later, or more frequently,</p>
<p>that does not have the same kind of behavior effect</p>
<p>as having continuous data where you can say,</p>
<p>okay, I drove to see you, Andrew, from my place in Berkeley,</p>
<p>and it was stressful, it was torrentially raining,</p>
<p>and I know my glucose was elevated.</p>
<p>I think really understanding what the mediators are</p>
<p>of your glucose control is essential.</p>
<p>Now, that said, it&rsquo;s also kind of a later effect.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d rather know your insulin,</p>
<p>and we know from the Whitehall study</p>
<p>that insulin, especially postprandial insulin,</p>
<p>fasting insulin too, can change years and years</p>
<p>before you get a change in glucose.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s more for prediabetes and diabetes.</p>
<p>So I think those are the main reasons</p>
<p>why I think it&rsquo;s such an important tool.</p>
<p>Third thing is it democratizes data, which you do too.</p>
<p>I mean, incredible how you do that with your podcast.</p>
<p>But I think one of the most hopeful and exciting things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m seeing right now in the health space</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re going from this patriarchal relationship</p>
<p>where doctors hold the power</p>
<p>and are the gatekeepers of data</p>
<p>to patients and clients having much more access</p>
<p>to that enchantment about their own chemistry</p>
<p>and their own biology.</p>
<p>So to me, that is so exciting.</p>
<p>Like for me to be able to, I&rsquo;ve got probably 100 patients</p>
<p>that are in a data stream with me</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re looking at their glucose,</p>
<p>and I can, I mean, I&rsquo;m on sabbatical,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not doing this so much anymore,</p>
<p>but I can call a patient, be like,</p>
<p>why is your glucose so high?</p>
<p>Like, what did you do?</p>
<p>Oh, it was my birthday.</p>
<p>I had a piece of birthday cake.</p>
<p>Like that kind of collaboration</p>
<p>that also is teaching the patient</p>
<p>to be their own clinician.</p>
<p>To me, that is a loop of benevolence and integrity</p>
<p>that I think is essential to creating health.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a disease care system.</p>
<p>We need the democratization of data</p>
<p>to become a health-based system.</p>
<p>Amen to that a million times over.</p>
<p>We share that sentiment.</p>
<p>I can tell it at a deep level.</p>
<p>I think the pandemic actually assisted in,</p>
<p>well, it harmed many things,</p>
<p>but it assisted in people&rsquo;s understanding</p>
<p>that no magic fairy, nor the government,</p>
<p>nor anyone was gonna arrive at their door</p>
<p>with a kit of things to make them healthy</p>
<p>that provide sunlight, movement, sleep,</p>
<p>and all the various aspects of nutrition.</p>
<p>No, nothing, nothing that everyone has to have access to</p>
<p>first and foremost,</p>
<p>and then implement those things as best they can.</p>
<p>Speaking of which,</p>
<p>and kind of circling back to this idea</p>
<p>of people in their late teens, 20s, 30s, and onward,</p>
<p>if you had a magic wand</p>
<p>and you could give two or three don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>or to make it personal,</p>
<p>if you could go back in time and erase certain behaviors,</p>
<p>what would the don&rsquo;ts category be?</p>
<p>You can tell us more than two or three,</p>
<p>but if the goal is to maximize vitality and longevity,</p>
<p>and those are not always parallel to one another,</p>
<p>certainly not the same thing, sometimes orthogonal,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say fertility being a proxy</p>
<p>for vitality and longevity.</p>
<p>I think people will sometimes forget this,</p>
<p>that fertility isn&rsquo;t just about people</p>
<p>who wanna conceive children.</p>
<p>It can serve as a proxy for vitality and longevity.</p>
<p>So what would you like to see patients,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s focus first on female patients,</p>
<p>but if it extends to male patients as well,</p>
<p>what would you like to see them not do or do far less of?</p>
<p>I really like that.</p>
<p>So I would say a few things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just headline them and then we can go into detail.</p>
<p>Number one, sleep.</p>
<p>I do wanna diverge from you a little bit on some things,</p>
<p>but sleep is probably not one of them.</p>
<p>No, well, feel free.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re the one that worked 120 hours a week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not sleeping much then.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine unless you lived in a different reality</p>
<p>than I do.</p>
<p>And there are times in my career</p>
<p>where I was pulling all-nighters and sleep deprived.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it, but I did it.</p>
<p>I hope you don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>No longer, if I can avoid it,</p>
<p>but there were years, many years where it was like,</p>
<p>all right, here we go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m quite adept at it for one cycle,</p>
<p>but two nights I kind of start to fall apart.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So I would say sleep, alcohol, high perceived stress.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to talk about maybe the data on telomeres</p>
<p>and what we know.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d like to see people get enough sleep.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t just-</p>
<p>Yeah, not all of these are concordant.</p>
<p>So not enough sleep, too much alcohol,</p>
<p>too much perceived stress, eating the wrong foods,</p>
<p>toxic relationships and isolation.</p>
<p>And then number six,</p>
<p>not moving enough or not moving and exercising</p>
<p>in a way that really fits with your body.</p>
<p>Can we start with that one actually?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Just cause it&rsquo;s such a, and then work backwards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think nowadays people appreciate the need</p>
<p>for quote unquote cardio.</p>
<p>I know that the exercise physiologists cringe</p>
<p>and dissolve into a puddle of tears when I say that,</p>
<p>but getting the heart rate up over some period of time</p>
<p>longer than 10 minutes</p>
<p>in order to generate cardiovascular health circulation.</p>
<p>So, and resistance training of some kind, maybe flexibility.</p>
<p>What do you mean by body phenotype and exercise?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speak from personal experience.</p>
<p>So what I did through,</p>
<p>I mean, I gave up my twenties to medicine.</p>
<p>And during that time, I occasionally got to the gym,</p>
<p>you know, at UCSF on Parnassus, you could go to the gym.</p>
<p>And then as soon as your beeper went off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re back into the hospital.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t exercise much.</p>
<p>I had, do you remember Nordic tracks?</p>
<p>I had a Nordic track in my house and that was like it.</p>
<p>What I believe, because for me,</p>
<p>the primary outcome that I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>is cardiometabolic health.</p>
<p>So when it comes to exercise,</p>
<p>what I really feel,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna be at a population level,</p>
<p>I feel that about a third cardio,</p>
<p>two thirds resistance training</p>
<p>is based on my synthesis of the literature,</p>
<p>the best combination.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>as you described with your sign study,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a minimal effective dose,</p>
<p>which for a population is about 150 minutes.</p>
<p>I think most of us need a lot more than that per week,</p>
<p>but I think, you know, for me,</p>
<p>because I have a phenotype that produces a lot of insulin,</p>
<p>kind of depending on how I&rsquo;m on my game,</p>
<p>I have a lot of glucose.</p>
<p>So I have to exercise a lot more to dispose that glucose.</p>
<p>So I think you then have to move from medicine</p>
<p>for the population or prescriptions for the population</p>
<p>to what works for the individual.</p>
<p>I think that recommendation is fantastic.</p>
<p>I think resistance training, well, let me put it this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither a trainer nor a physician,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen in family members that were doing,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say a lot of cardio, but just cardio,</p>
<p>that when they add resistance training,</p>
<p>everything in terms, including their biomarkers,</p>
<p>have improved dramatically.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is in particular for female members of my family.</p>
<p>Well, one of the mediators that I think is important,</p>
<p>especially for people who do what I call chronic cardio,</p>
<p>which is what I did, is cortisol.</p>
<p>So we know that runners, especially marathon runners,</p>
<p>people who do a lot of cardio</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do much resistance training,</p>
<p>they tend to have much high cortisol levels.</p>
<p>And you can buffer that with vitamin C.</p>
<p>Vitamin C can decrease the effect,</p>
<p>but chronic cardio doesn&rsquo;t always serve people.</p>
<p>So quick personal example.</p>
<p>When I first started measuring hormone panels in myself,</p>
<p>I went to my physician and I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 35, I&rsquo;ve had one kid, I wanna have another kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been so exhausted in my life.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;m pushing a rock up the hill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this belly fat that I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna have sex with my husband.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>What can we do about this?</p>
<p>And he offered a birth control pill and an antidepressant.</p>
<p>So I left him and I went to the lab</p>
<p>and I ran a hormone panel,</p>
<p>and my cortisol was three times what it should have been.</p>
<p>My insulin was in the 20s, I was fasting.</p>
<p>My glucose was 105.</p>
<p>My thyroid was mildly abnormal.</p>
<p>My progesterone was low.</p>
<p>And that set me on this course of realizing</p>
<p>that what I was doing as a physician,</p>
<p>taking care especially of women,</p>
<p>was not getting to some of these root causes</p>
<p>that are so essential.</p>
<p>And I would say, I had to start first with cortisol.</p>
<p>At that time, I was running four miles,</p>
<p>three times a week, four times a week.</p>
<p>That was just racing my cortisol further.</p>
<p>So that was not the right exercise for me.</p>
<p>I needed more adaptive exercise.</p>
<p>I started doing Pilates, more yoga.</p>
<p>That helped to lower my cortisol.</p>
<p>I mean, it started me on changing the way</p>
<p>I was managing perceived stress</p>
<p>and it also changed my supplement regimen.</p>
<p>Can we talk about that?</p>
<p>With the moment you said lowering cortisol,</p>
<p>thought of the two supplements that come to mind</p>
<p>are ashwagandha, which I think can potently reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard some recommendations about cycling it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always wondered about time of day</p>
<p>for ashwagandha intake because sort of,</p>
<p>quote unquote, want cortisol elevated</p>
<p>in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>We know you do not want cortisol peaking later in the day.</p>
<p>No, you do not.</p>
<p>Interferes with sleep.</p>
<p>Interferes with sleep.</p>
<p>And then the other supplement is rhodiola rosacea.</p>
<p>Do I, am I pronouncing that correctly?</p>
<p>Yeah, so rhodiola is very effective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown in multiple randomized trials</p>
<p>to lower cortisol.</p>
<p>So that could be very effective.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your dose?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking it recently, by the way,</p>
<p>and I made a huge mistake.</p>
<p>I like to make the mistakes first</p>
<p>so then my audiences don&rsquo;t make them.</p>
<p>As I was taking it, I heard it was an adaptogen.</p>
<p>So I thought, oh, I&rsquo;ll take it before resistance training.</p>
<p>But of course you want the cortisol peak</p>
<p>during resistance training</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to set in motion the adaptive response.</p>
<p>So I started taking it later in the day</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really improved.</p>
<p>I would say my late day, second half of the day cognition,</p>
<p>this is subjective, to be fair.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;m in a more even plane of attention</p>
<p>in the second half of the day.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re describing an NF1 experiment, which is-</p>
<p>Anecdata.</p>
<p>Well, it is not anecdotal.</p>
<p>So I was taught at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>that the hierarchy of evidence starts at the lowest</p>
<p>with expert opinion, case studies,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got cohort studies,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got observational data that&rsquo;s prospective,</p>
<p>then you have randomized trial.</p>
<p>But the highest quality evidence of all</p>
<p>is the NF1 experiment, where you serve as your own control.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re describing with rhodiola,</p>
<p>I would frame that as an NF1 experiment</p>
<p>where you have a washout period</p>
<p>and you compare before and after.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to measure some other metrics</p>
<p>to see if there&rsquo;s an effect, including your cortisol.</p>
<p>So rhodiola has been shown in multiple randomized trials</p>
<p>to reduce cortisol.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think is super effective</p>
<p>is phosphatidylserine, PS for short.</p>
<p>Fish oil also more modestly reduces cortisol.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is interesting.</p>
<p>So in my first book, The Hormone Cure,</p>
<p>which I read, by the way.</p>
<p>You did? I did.</p>
<p>I was hoping that was the one you read.</p>
<p>I did, I read it and it&rsquo;s spectacular.</p>
<p>And I thought going into it, I had this like,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s just call it what it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of male bias.</p>
<p>Like, is there gonna be anything in here for me?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t have ovaries and you know,</p>
<p>is this gonna be, and it was immensely informative.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have very fond recollections</p>
<p>of the walks I took listening to it.</p>
<p>And then I own the print version too.</p>
<p>So I like to switch back and forth.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a superb book for anyone to read.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I so appreciate that.</p>
<p>So in chapter four, you may or may not remember</p>
<p>that Ashwagandha, at least the time that I wrote that book,</p>
<p>Ashwagandha&rsquo;s data is not great,</p>
<p>but lack of proof is not proof against.</p>
<p>So with Ashwagandha, most of the data comes</p>
<p>from thousands of years of using it in Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s considered, again, not my science hat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s considered a double adaptogen</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s potentially helpful</p>
<p>when you are a high cortisol phenotype,</p>
<p>like I was, like I sometimes still am, or low cortisol.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found that in my patients,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ll give you one exception.</p>
<p>So Ashwagandha is mostly based on animal studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not as much human data,</p>
<p>but it is used a ton in integrative medicine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one supplement that I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>to be incredibly helpful for people</p>
<p>who tend to have high cortisol at night,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called a Cortisol Manager.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by Integrative Therapeutics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a second supplement manufacturer</p>
<p>that makes something similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their number one selling supplement</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so effective.</p>
<p>Is it a cocktail of several things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of phosphatidylserine and Ashwagandha.</p>
<p>Tell me more about phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>I am familiar with it for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been mentioned by some guests</p>
<p>that were on the Tim Ferriss podcast long ago</p>
<p>for other reasons, I think related to sleep.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s another reason why you like it.</p>
<p>But before we move on from rhodiola,</p>
<p>is there a dosage of rhodiola rosacea that you-</p>
<p>So I would refer people to my book</p>
<p>because the randomized trials</p>
<p>and the doses that were used are in there.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t remember with rhodiola,</p>
<p>although I took it this morning to prepare it</p>
<p>to be with you.</p>
<p>We can look it up and put a show note caption</p>
<p>so people can link it.</p>
<p>I can remember the dose with phosphatidylserine</p>
<p>because I take that regularly.</p>
<p>So 400 to 800 milligrams is the typical dose for PS.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that</p>
<p>in the randomized trials that were done,</p>
<p>400 milligrams was more effective than 800 milligrams.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that for several supplements</p>
<p>that the lower dose was more effective.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what those were.</p>
<p>And so when you say PS,</p>
<p>you were referring to, by the way, folks, not PCOS,</p>
<p>just because scientists and clinicians are familiar with,</p>
<p>and military, very familiar with acronyms,</p>
<p>phosphatidylserine, PS, so 400 to 800 milligrams,</p>
<p>400 being more effective,</p>
<p>taken later in the day or early day?</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>It depends on when your cortisol is high.</p>
<p>So for me, I tend to, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the pattern for cortisol?</p>
<p>Typically it rises to its peak</p>
<p>30 to 60 minutes after you get up.</p>
<p>Then it has this gradual kind of asymptotic decline</p>
<p>until you go to bed.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone like me who peaks like way crazy high,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that anymore, but that&rsquo;s what I used to do.</p>
<p>I needed phosphatidylserine in the morning.</p>
<p>For people who are high at night,</p>
<p>who have what&rsquo;s known as a flat cortisol pattern</p>
<p>or a inverted pattern, you wanna take it at night.</p>
<p>And the flat pattern, just quick sidebar,</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s associated with a number of conditions</p>
<p>that most mainstream physicians don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>So a flat pattern where it&rsquo;s low in the morning</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s high at night is associated with anxiety,</p>
<p>depression, decreased survival from breast cancer.</p>
<p>That was studied at Stanford by David Spiegel.</p>
<p>He was my close, even collaborator,</p>
<p>even on the breathwork study that we just did.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s our associate chair of psychiatry now.</p>
<p>So a wonderful human being has been a guest on this podcast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now fantasizing about a conversation</p>
<p>that includes a panel of incredible minds</p>
<p>like you and David from the clinical side.</p>
<p>So in any case, yeah, the late shifted cortisol, not good.</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>And it seems to have the worst immune downstream issues</p>
<p>of any of the cortisol patterns.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really important to know about</p>
<p>because it then maps to things like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to PTSD.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the pattern we see like in vets</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve got PTSD as well as others.</p>
<p>It maps to auto-immunity.</p>
<p>It maps to fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>I was told that one in 12 people have our heterozygous,</p>
<p>so one mutant copy or hypomorphic for some mutation</p>
<p>in adrenal related genes,</p>
<p>so congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>And if so, that means that one in 12 people walking around</p>
<p>are cranking out far too much cortisol</p>
<p>or not enough cortisol or the cortisol system</p>
<p>is already skewed in a direction</p>
<p>that makes life more challenging</p>
<p>at the levels we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Did I hear that correctly?</p>
<p>Because that one in 12 is not a small number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a small number.</p>
<p>It fits with what I see clinically.</p>
<p>I mean, I wanna see that data just to see</p>
<p>what does that mean?</p>
<p>And could you modulate it with environmental influences?</p>
<p>But it certainly fits with what I see.</p>
<p>I was taught once again in mainstream medicine</p>
<p>that in terms of adrenal function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very binary how most clinicians think about it.</p>
<p>You either have Addison&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t make enough cortisol</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got Cushing&rsquo;s or Cushingoid pattern</p>
<p>and you make too much cortisol</p>
<p>and anything in the middle is normal.</p>
<p>And my experience is that, hell no,</p>
<p>like there are those of us like me</p>
<p>who make a lot of cortisol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have Cushing&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve got one of these.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a mutant gene.</p>
<p>I would call it more of a vulnerable gene.</p>
<p>So maybe I have one of those.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s part of the reason why</p>
<p>I make two to three times what I should be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of certain groups of individuals</p>
<p>from within the military sector</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a more frequent occurrence</p>
<p>of some mutation in CH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Not necessarily two copies,</p>
<p>which if people look that up, they&rsquo;re gonna go,</p>
<p>oh, wow, there&rsquo;s all these phenotypes.</p>
<p>But sort of hypomorphic type things,</p>
<p>less than or too much cortisol.</p>
<p>And they are very good at staying up</p>
<p>multiple days per night, multiple nights in the series.</p>
<p>So they can pull all-nighters very easily.</p>
<p>They can push harder when most people would quit.</p>
<p>And everyone thinks, well, that&rsquo;s a great phenotype to have,</p>
<p>but guess what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they hyperproduce cortisol.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I think if we were to panel medical students</p>
<p>and graduate students,</p>
<p>and you were to look at who&rsquo;s pulling excessively long hours,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s stressed out a lot,</p>
<p>even outside of academia and medicine,</p>
<p>and pushing, pushing, pushing really hard.</p>
<p>I think the ability to push and not crash,</p>
<p>we think of it as adaptive,</p>
<p>but in some sense it&rsquo;s maladaptive over a series of years,</p>
<p>which is sort of what you described earlier.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s such a good point because,</p>
<p>in some ways you wanna select for that</p>
<p>in certain professions,</p>
<p>like in the military, like in medicine.</p>
<p>But I would wonder for those folks</p>
<p>about the downstream consequences</p>
<p>of producing so much cortisol.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s gotta be detrimental for their health</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>And you see that.</p>
<p>But even the data shows that if you&rsquo;re someone like me</p>
<p>who makes a lot of cortisol, higher rates of depression,</p>
<p>like 50% of people with major depression</p>
<p>have high cortisol levels, higher rates of suicide.</p>
<p>Much more metabolic dysfunction.</p>
<p>We know that trauma, as an example,</p>
<p>maps to an increased risk of glucose metabolism issues.</p>
<p>And certainly high cortisol does that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of the jobs of cortisol</p>
<p>is to manage a glucose.</p>
<p>And it kind of sets you up for this one number five,</p>
<p>which is toxic relationships.</p>
<p>Someone who hyperproduces cortisol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to live with someone like that.</p>
<p>I would say people that have this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it biological resilience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always adaptive</p>
<p>because you can stay in bad circumstances longer.</p>
<p>The ability to crash,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not suicide or life destroying</p>
<p>or long arc of pause and the requirement</p>
<p>to take two years off from work or school or something.</p>
<p>The ability to keep pressing on is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>I want to make sure in staying within this conversation,</p>
<p>because you mentioned phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>we talked about rhodiola rosacea.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about ashwagandha.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also talked about omega-3s and fish oil in particular.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know your favorite sources of these.</p>
<p>I think nowadays there&rsquo;s more general acceptance</p>
<p>that getting these essential fatty acids is important.</p>
<p>Do you have a threshold level of sort of grams?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve encouraged podcast listeners</p>
<p>to consider, depending on what they&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>to try and get a gram of EPA or more per day.</p>
<p>Does that seem excessive?</p>
<p>And what are the real data on EPAs?</p>
<p>Because then the cardiovascular experts</p>
<p>always hit back and say,</p>
<p>oh, no, it&rsquo;s not good for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>And then you go,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s better than antidepressants and other studies.</p>
<p>And they go, no.</p>
<p>So I feel like if you really want to make your life difficult,</p>
<p>if you want to raise your cortisol,</p>
<p>you go on Twitter and you say something positive</p>
<p>about omega-3s and fish oil.</p>
<p>And you learn a lot.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on omega-3s?</p>
<p>I take a lot of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is where I personalize.</p>
<p>I think some people need more than others.</p>
<p>And what I do is I measure your level.</p>
<p>So this gets back to nutritional testing.</p>
<p>So for you, I would suggest an OmegaQuant</p>
<p>or one of my favorite cardiometabolic panels</p>
<p>is to do a Cleveland Heart Lab.</p>
<p>So I think they give me the most reliable information,</p>
<p>not just for lipids and subclasses and NMR fractionation,</p>
<p>but it also gives me an insulin resistance score.</p>
<p>It gives me levels of omega-3s.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide links to these different sites</p>
<p>so that people-</p>
<p>But one quick thing about that,</p>
<p>the whole story is not omega-3s and taking fish oil.</p>
<p>So the work of Charlie Serhan at the Brigham</p>
<p>is showing that the way that we resolve inflammation,</p>
<p>our understanding of it is really,</p>
<p>I think, in the learning to crawl stage.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the omega-3-6 pathway in the body,</p>
<p>fish oils can help kind of push the reactions</p>
<p>in a particular direction,</p>
<p>but typically they&rsquo;re not enough</p>
<p>for the resolution of inflammation.</p>
<p>Now, what most people do, including my MBA players,</p>
<p>is they pop an ibuprofen or something like that</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve got inflammation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got lots of other side effects</p>
<p>that are not so good for you.</p>
<p>And we know in terms of the resolution of inflammation</p>
<p>that taking something like ibuprofen</p>
<p>reduces the amplitude of inflammation by about 50%,</p>
<p>but then it potentially blocks</p>
<p>the complete resolution of inflammation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these new supplements</p>
<p>called specialized pro-resolving mediators.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different supplement companies</p>
<p>that make them.</p>
<p>And that combined with fish oil</p>
<p>seems to be the best combination.</p>
<p>And what I do for athletes who&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>kind of the normal aches and pains</p>
<p>of the training load they have</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll combine a little aspirin,</p>
<p>small dose, just like 81 milligrams</p>
<p>or two of those, baby aspirin,</p>
<p>together with fish oil</p>
<p>plus specialized pro-resolving mediators.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some that are NSF,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re certified for sports.</p>
<p>But the dose, I would say with my patients,</p>
<p>some of them only need 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>your gram that you mentioned for the population.</p>
<p>Some of them need six grams together with SPMs.</p>
<p>So I think it has to be personalized.</p>
<p>How young is it okay for people</p>
<p>to start taking omega-3s?</p>
<p>For instance, young women in their teens,</p>
<p>in their 20s and their 30s,</p>
<p>young guys in their 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>should they take fish oil?</p>
<p>Assuming they&rsquo;re not going to get anything tested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the college student</p>
<p>who is really into biomarkers</p>
<p>and that sort of thing will go do some of this.</p>
<p>But many people won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but they want to do the right thing.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll try and drink a little less.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won&rsquo;t smoke or vape.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t smoke or vape.</p>
<p>The idea that vaping is, okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we had this whole episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad.</p>
<p>So bad for everything we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end that chapter.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So just, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully they&rsquo;ll try and avoid those things.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;ll avoid hard drugs.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;ll avoid getting any STIs.</p>
<p>If they do, they&rsquo;ll resolve them quickly, hopefully.</p>
<p>So, but they might say, oh, well, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to, you know, take some magnesium</p>
<p>or take some phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>buffer my cortisol, eat some vegetables.</p>
<p>Should they consider taking fish oil</p>
<p>as a kind of across the board inoculatory thing?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to rank order these.</p>
<p>I would say fish oil, yes.</p>
<p>I think a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>as a general recommendation is good,</p>
<p>but I also have a food first philosophy.</p>
<p>So my preference would be that they&rsquo;re having salmon</p>
<p>or some kind of smash fish,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting that as the primary source</p>
<p>of their omega-3s.</p>
<p>And then the days that they don&rsquo;t have fish,</p>
<p>I recommend it probably twice a week</p>
<p>that they take fish oil.</p>
<p>Then I would put magnesium next,</p>
<p>since so many people are deficient.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d probably put vitamin D.</p>
<p>How many IU of vitamin D per day?</p>
<p>Well, you keep asking me this, like for the population.</p>
<p>Well, let me put it this way.</p>
<p>For the lazy person or, and this is an or, not an and,</p>
<p>or the person who just doesn&rsquo;t have the finances</p>
<p>to go get levels measured.</p>
<p>Because, you know, our audience is a huge range.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got people who can have tons of disposable income</p>
<p>that listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>We have people that have no disposable income.</p>
<p>So 1,000 to 2,000 international units.</p>
<p>But my, you know, what I do is I dose to a serum level</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s between about 50 and 90.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And so I have a vitamin D receptor snip.</p>
<p>And so I need to take about 5,000 a day</p>
<p>to get to what I need.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s some supplements that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they need.</p>
<p>So you mentioned phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>For someone who&rsquo;s a college student</p>
<p>and their cortisol is completely normal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re wasting their money on PS.</p>
<p>They might need it later, but they don&rsquo;t need it now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make sure that we circle back to birth control.</p>
<p>In particular, oral contraceptive birth control.</p>
<p>And we should touch on IUDs perhaps a little bit more.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts on sort of</p>
<p>pure estrogen birth control?</p>
<p>This is what I learned when I was in college</p>
<p>is that birth control is basically tonic estrogen.</p>
<p>So constantly taking estrogen, estrogen.</p>
<p>Women are taking estrogen</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t get the estrogen priming of progesterone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting any ovulation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve known women that have been taking oral,</p>
<p>or that took oral contraception as like estrogen pills</p>
<p>basically for five, 10, 15 years.</p>
<p>Are there long-term consequences of this</p>
<p>as it relates to pregnancy, PCOS, menopause?</p>
<p>If so, what are some of those consequences?</p>
<p>What are your concerns?</p>
<p>What do you like about oral contraceptives?</p>
<p>What do you dislike about them?</p>
<p>I like how balanced you ask that question.</p>
<p>So women who take oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re describing like 10 years or longer,</p>
<p>we call those Olympic oral contraceptive users.</p>
<p>In terms of benefit, I think that,</p>
<p>especially when they first came out and even now,</p>
<p>it gives women reproductive choice and that&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>As you may know,</p>
<p>our reproductive choice has been declining recently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big fan in that regard,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got a lot of data to show both the risks</p>
<p>and also the benefits of it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll speak first into the benefits</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna get on a soapbox a little bit</p>
<p>about the risks.</p>
<p>So we know that it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about this idea of incessant ovulation</p>
<p>that is not good for the female body.</p>
<p>So if you look at, for instance,</p>
<p>women who are nuns,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t take oral contraceptives</p>
<p>and they have a period every single month</p>
<p>of their reproductive lives,</p>
<p>they have a greater risk of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>So if you look then at women who have several babies</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got a period of time when they&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not ovulating</p>
<p>and then they breastfeed for some period of time,</p>
<p>they have a lower risk of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>So oral contraceptives help with reducing ovulation</p>
<p>and reducing risk.</p>
<p>We know that if you take the oral contraceptive</p>
<p>for about five years,</p>
<p>it reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 50%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s significant because we&rsquo;re so poor</p>
<p>at diagnosing ovarian cancer early.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no method that&rsquo;s really effective.</p>
<p>We use CA-125 and ultrasound screening,</p>
<p>especially in women who are at greater genetic risk.</p>
<p>But even that, often we diagnose it in a later stage.</p>
<p>Maybe just because that statement is gonna highlight</p>
<p>for a number of people,</p>
<p>the question of what are some of the earliest symptoms</p>
<p>that people can recognize without a blood test?</p>
<p>So is ovarian cancer, is it gonna be pain?</p>
<p>So the problem is the symptoms are so vague</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so nonspecific.</p>
<p>One of the most common symptoms is bloating.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already talked about constipation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about how women have this longer GI track.</p>
<p>And so bloating is a really common experience</p>
<p>for most women.</p>
<p>You can have bulk symptoms,</p>
<p>feeling like your lower belly is kind of pressed out.</p>
<p>So the way that we inform women</p>
<p>in terms of watching for this</p>
<p>is to get regular gynecologic exams</p>
<p>for women who are at high risk</p>
<p>or they have, for instance, an ultrasound for some reason</p>
<p>and it shows a mass that we&rsquo;re concerned about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way to triage that</p>
<p>in terms of what kind of evaluation that they need.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a situation where you might get a blood test</p>
<p>called the CA-125.</p>
<p>Yeah, the problem is the symptoms are so vague.</p>
<p>It could be, it depends on how big the tumor is,</p>
<p>how much bulk you have, what it&rsquo;s pressing on.</p>
<p>So if taking estrogen</p>
<p>and thereby reducing the frequency of ovulation</p>
<p>lowers the risk of ovarian cancer,</p>
<p>should women that are,</p>
<p>even women who are not sexually active,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not actively trying to get pregnant</p>
<p>or avoid getting pregnant,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re not sexually active,</p>
<p>then the probability of conceiving</p>
<p>unless they go through some IUI or some other route</p>
<p>is very low, as far as I know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was taught in high school anyway.</p>
<p>Would they be wise to suppress ovulation</p>
<p>for periodically using hormone-based contraception</p>
<p>just so that they can offset the risk of ovarian cancer?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very rational question.</p>
<p>And I would say that&rsquo;s what mainstream medicine</p>
<p>has had at its back to recommend oral contraceptives,</p>
<p>not just for women who are seeking contraception,</p>
<p>but for acne, for painful periods,</p>
<p>for really kind of the drop of a hat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re prescribing oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was taught to do.</p>
<p>But there are so many consequences.</p>
<p>And I think the issue here is more about consent</p>
<p>because in OB-GYN,</p>
<p>and I started out as a board-certified OB-GYN,</p>
<p>and I now mostly see men,</p>
<p>but I was taught as an OB-GYN</p>
<p>to convince women to go on the oral contraceptive.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of that is pharmaceutical influence.</p>
<p>So maybe we could talk about the risks</p>
<p>and why the answer is no to your question.</p>
<p>As we do that, could I just ask,</p>
<p>is the so-called ring,</p>
<p>it used to be called the NuvaRing,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a brand name,</p>
<p>but when I was in college,</p>
<p>there was all this discussion about the ring</p>
<p>by both men and women for reasons</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t belong on the podcast.</p>
<p>Use your imagination, folks.</p>
<p>So the ring, obviously, it&rsquo;s not oral hormone contraception,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hormone-based, right?</p>
<p>The ring is releasing estrogen locally</p>
<p>as opposed to taking it orally.</p>
<p>But would you slot it under what you&rsquo;re about to tell us</p>
<p>in terms of the concerns?</p>
<p>So we have less data about the ring.</p>
<p>So the oral contraceptive is two hormones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ethanol estradiol,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a progestin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the normal progesterone that your body makes,</p>
<p>that your ovaries make and your adrenals make.</p>
<p>It is a synthetic form of progesterone.</p>
<p>And it is the same progestin, similar,</p>
<p>same class that was shown to be dangerous and provocative</p>
<p>in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a fan of progestins.</p>
<p>I do not recommend them for any woman</p>
<p>unless the consequence of not taking them</p>
<p>is surgery or some other,</p>
<p>unless it gives them some freedom in some way.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like progestins.</p>
<p>The NuvaRing is estrogen plus progestin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s released transdermally through the vagina.</p>
<p>So given the way that it&rsquo;s delivered to the vagina,</p>
<p>the doses are lower than what&rsquo;s taken orally.</p>
<p>But in terms of some of the risks</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to talk about,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know about much of the data.</p>
<p>We think that it&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a spectrum of risk,</p>
<p>and the NuvaRing is a little more towards the middle</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;m talking about with oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>Are you ready for that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m ready for the risks.</p>
<p>Okay, so like with almost any pharmaceutical,</p>
<p>the oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients.</p>
<p>So magnesium, there&rsquo;s certain vitamin Bs that are depleted.</p>
<p>It also affects the microbiome.</p>
<p>That data is not as strong,</p>
<p>but there seems to be some effect,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also an increased risk</p>
<p>of inflammatory bowel disease in autoimmune condition.</p>
<p>It increases inflammatory tone.</p>
<p>So the studies that I&rsquo;ve seen increase</p>
<p>one of the markers of inflammatory tone,</p>
<p>high-sensitivity CRP, by about two to three X.</p>
<p>It seems to make the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</p>
<p>more rigid so that you can&rsquo;t kind of roll with the punches</p>
<p>and wax and wane in terms of cortisol production</p>
<p>the way that you can off the birth control pill.</p>
<p>It can affect thyroid function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of the slide that I have</p>
<p>that has like 10 problems associated</p>
<p>with the oral contraceptive,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I can remember right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very helpful, and it makes me wonder whether or not,</p>
<p>if on the one hand, oral contraceptives are protective</p>
<p>in women against ovarian cancer,</p>
<p>but then they have these other issues.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s one other I want to mention.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Anytime you take oral estrogen,</p>
<p>it raises sex hormone-binding globulin,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve talked to other podcast guests about this.</p>
<p>Kyle, I think.</p>
<p>Sex hormone-binding globulin, I think of as a sponge</p>
<p>that soaks up free estrogen and free testosterone.</p>
<p>So when you go on the birth control pill,</p>
<p>you raise your sex hormone-binding globulin.</p>
<p>It soaks up especially free testosterone,</p>
<p>and for some women, it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t notice much of a difference,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a phenotype,</p>
<p>maybe related to CAG repeats on the androgen receptor,</p>
<p>who are exquisitely sensitive</p>
<p>to that decline in free testosterone.</p>
<p>So this then opens the portal of talking a little bit</p>
<p>about testosterone in women.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve mentioned already that it&rsquo;s the most abundant,</p>
<p>biologically, the most abundant hormone</p>
<p>in the female system.</p>
<p>Even though men make almost 10 times as much</p>
<p>or even more than 10 times, it is so important for women.</p>
<p>It is essential to so many things,</p>
<p>not just sex drive and muscle mass</p>
<p>and seeing a response to resistance training,</p>
<p>but also confidence and agency.</p>
<p>And so those women who are so sensitive</p>
<p>to their testosterone level,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got this high sex hormone-binding globulin,</p>
<p>their testosterone declines,</p>
<p>what they describe is vaginal dryness,</p>
<p>maybe a decline in sex drive,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also this bigger issue</p>
<p>related to confidence and agency,</p>
<p>even risk-taking from studies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done with MBA students</p>
<p>that I think is a serious problem.</p>
<p>Maybe the most important out of all of these things</p>
<p>is that it can shrink the clitoris by up to 20%, 20%.</p>
<p>And that includes a regression of the nerves</p>
<p>that innervate the clitoris?</p>
<p>Is that, I mean-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question as a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would think,</p>
<p>used to teach the neural side of reproductive health.</p>
<p>We need to do a series on sexual health.</p>
<p>Maybe you would co-host that with me.</p>
<p>We could certainly use your expertise.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, that&rsquo;s a dramatic number.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then let&rsquo;s go back to the sacred marketing.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve got a woman</p>
<p>that I think should not be on the birth control pill,</p>
<p>maybe she&rsquo;s taking it for acne</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s taking it</p>
<p>because her periods were a little painful.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m gonna do is say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s leverage these other ways</p>
<p>of making your period less painful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the message of your painful periods</p>
<p>and figure out, okay, is it your inflammatory tone?</p>
<p>And we give you some fish oil and SPMs,</p>
<p>maybe a little aspirin when you&rsquo;ve got your period.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s find some other ways to deal with it</p>
<p>than to take the oral contraceptive,</p>
<p>which you have not received informed consent about,</p>
<p>because it can shrink your clit by up to 20%.</p>
<p>Now, that usually convinces most people to come off of it.</p>
<p>Is that reversible?</p>
<p>The elevation in sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>does not seem to go away</p>
<p>when you come off the birth control pill.</p>
<p>To me, that is the biggest problem</p>
<p>with prescribing oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>Now, the data that we have is limited.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one woman who, Claudia something something,</p>
<p>who looked at sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>a year out from stopping the birth control pill,</p>
<p>and it was still elevated.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as high as it was when they were on the pill,</p>
<p>but it was still elevated.</p>
<p>So your question about reversibility,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s a significant statement</p>
<p>and something that for consideration.</p>
<p>Related to this, although this might seem not related,</p>
<p>it is, how early do you recommend</p>
<p>that women go get their follicle number assessed?</p>
<p>In other words, to get a sense of the size</p>
<p>of the ovarian reserve and their AMH levels measured?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an amateur outsider as I say this,</p>
<p>but we have an episode on the fertility</p>
<p>where I just described the ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best person to answer that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we can-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too far out from it.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I suppose then from taking the perspective</p>
<p>of somebody who thinks about fertility</p>
<p>in terms of at least congruent with vitality and longevity,</p>
<p>given that it&rsquo;s fairly non-invasive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ultrasound or a blood draw for AMH or both,</p>
<p>is there any reason why a woman</p>
<p>would not want to get her follicle number assessed</p>
<p>or her AMH levels assessed?</p>
<p>Is there any reason why?</p>
<p>Because I was shocked to learn</p>
<p>that most women don&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re hitting their late 30s or early 40s</p>
<p>and they either haven&rsquo;t conceived</p>
<p>or they suddenly decide that they want to conceive.</p>
<p>And I thought, why doesn&rsquo;t every doctor insist</p>
<p>that their female patients have their AMH level addressed</p>
<p>so that if they need to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cost.</p>
<p>Freeze eggs, they can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cost.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think if you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the disposable income to do it, go for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not included in a standard blood panel?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>The only women in my practice who&rsquo;ve had AMHs done</p>
<p>and have looked at their follicle count</p>
<p>are women who want to freeze their eggs</p>
<p>or, and that requires disposable income,</p>
<p>or they are having trouble getting pregnant.</p>
<p>So they are in the reproductive endocrinology system</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting an evaluation.</p>
<p>And then there are also the women</p>
<p>who have symptoms of early menopause.</p>
<p>So premature ovarian insufficiency, which is before age 40.</p>
<p>Those are the women that I see getting attested.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that it should be offered more broadly.</p>
<p>It speaks to the democratization of data again.</p>
<p>And I think most women don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing a huge service,</p>
<p>I think, to be speaking into this.</p>
<p>One other point related to that</p>
<p>is that what I see in conventional medicine</p>
<p>is that when a woman asks for a hormone panel</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not trying to get pregnant,</p>
<p>she usually gets told that hormones vary too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of money.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re feeling hormonal,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you go on a birth control pill?</p>
<p>Unless she&rsquo;s trying to get pregnant.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s trying to get pregnant,</p>
<p>suddenly those same tests are very reliable</p>
<p>and they get their testosterone,</p>
<p>their free testosterone, their thyroid panel,</p>
<p>they get their estrogen and progesterone,</p>
<p>maybe they get their cortisol, they get their AMH.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a double standard</p>
<p>between those who wanna get pregnant and those who don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and that needs to end.</p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve learned more about ovulatory cycle and AMH</p>
<p>and the enteral population of follicles,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating, it just seems to me,</p>
<p>wow, a relatively straightforward test.</p>
<p>One, definitely invasive ultrasound, but-</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t consider that.</p>
<p>Yeah, not terribly invasive, but invasive,</p>
<p>but the other one, just pure blood test,</p>
<p>just seems like, why wouldn&rsquo;t this be offered</p>
<p>or covered by insurance or that anyone that wanted?</p>
<p>But now I understand why.</p>
<p>You mentioned menopause, huge topic, enormous topic.</p>
<p>We had a guest on the podcast who&rsquo;s not a clinician</p>
<p>who said something in passing,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m likely to get this wrong,</p>
<p>but what they said was that the results</p>
<p>of the large-scale trials on hormone replacement therapy</p>
<p>for women for menopause said something to the effect of,</p>
<p>if the hormone therapy was started early enough,</p>
<p>it was very beneficial for vitality and health outcomes.</p>
<p>Whereas if women went through menopause</p>
<p>and then initiated the hormone therapy,</p>
<p>hormone replacement therapy,</p>
<p>that it could be detrimental to their health.</p>
<p>So first of all, do I recall that statement correctly?</p>
<p>And then second of all,</p>
<p>what sorts of hormones are being replaced?</p>
<p>Is it just estrogen and how is that done?</p>
<p>Is it done through birth control?</p>
<p>So oral contraceptives, NuvaRings,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on menopause?</p>
<p>When should people start thinking about it?</p>
<p>And what is the palette of things available</p>
<p>so that we can do an entire episode with you</p>
<p>on this topic in the future?</p>
<p>But just to, I get a lot of questions about this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing, based on everything you&rsquo;ve told me today,</p>
<p>that there are women in their 30s</p>
<p>that while they may be 20 years out from menopause,</p>
<p>probably should be doing things now</p>
<p>in anticipation of that.</p>
<p>Yes, so we haven&rsquo;t talked about the 30-something,</p>
<p>but I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>The more you know about your phenotype,</p>
<p>your hormonal phenotype when you&rsquo;re in your 30s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re set up in terms of what to do in the future,</p>
<p>especially things like your thyroid,</p>
<p>your estrogen and progesterone levels,</p>
<p>because you can replace to a state of euthyroid,</p>
<p>whatever that is for you.</p>
<p>You can replace, I don&rsquo;t usually go exactly back</p>
<p>to where the estrogen and progesterone levels were,</p>
<p>but we can get pretty close.</p>
<p>So in your 30s, having a base case,</p>
<p>I think is really essential.</p>
<p>So you spoke to the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative,</p>
<p>which was published in 2002,</p>
<p>and we went from a huge number of women</p>
<p>taking hormone therapy to a very small percentage,</p>
<p>like in the range of 5%.</p>
<p>And that means we&rsquo;ve got millions and millions of women</p>
<p>who are suffering needlessly with things like insomnia,</p>
<p>difficulty with their mood, difficulty with sex drive,</p>
<p>feeling like they are closing the store in terms of sex,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not on hormone therapy.</p>
<p>I would agree with the statement that you made</p>
<p>that hormone therapy, particular forms</p>
<p>that are similar to what your body always made,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s given judiciously at the right time,</p>
<p>typically within five to 10 years of menopause,</p>
<p>which is 51 to 52, that it is incredibly safe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a complicated study, the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative,</p>
<p>but it was the wrong study and the wrong patients</p>
<p>with the wrong medications</p>
<p>and with some of the wrong outcomes.</p>
<p>So it was powered to look at cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>It was not powered to look at breast cancer.</p>
<p>It was stopped because of breast cancer risk.</p>
<p>But what happened in the control arm of the study</p>
<p>was that they had an incredibly low rate of breast cancer.</p>
<p>And so as a result,</p>
<p>they ended up having this increased risk of breast cancer</p>
<p>at five years, and they stopped the study.</p>
<p>Now, the study was done with synthetics.</p>
<p>It was done with conjugated equine estrogen,</p>
<p>known as Premarin, and medroxyprogesterone acetate.</p>
<p>Those were the so-called estrogen and progesterone.</p>
<p>Those are synthetic hormones.</p>
<p>We think especially the progestin is associated</p>
<p>with the greater risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Although the subsequent re-evaluations of the data,</p>
<p>now 18 years out, have shown that this problem</p>
<p>with the control group and no increased risk</p>
<p>of breast cancer.</p>
<p>And for the women who got estrogen only,</p>
<p>those who had a hysterectomy, the Premarin,</p>
<p>they actually had a decreased breast cancer risk</p>
<p>and decreased breast cancer mortality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to be said about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep it really brief.</p>
<p>But if you look at the women 50 to 60,</p>
<p>so within 10 years of menopause,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who seem to have the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>So they had a decreased subclinical atherosclerosis,</p>
<p>so less cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>They had an improvement in terms of bone health,</p>
<p>less progression to diabetes.</p>
<p>And then over the age of 60,</p>
<p>they started to have greater risk of certain outcomes,</p>
<p>such as cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>myocardial infarction, and so on.</p>
<p>You asked about, what do I do?</p>
<p>And to me, this problem is not just menopause.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more interesting is to talk about perimenopause.</p>
<p>So perimenopause is the period of time</p>
<p>before your final menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And for most women,</p>
<p>depending on how attuned you are to the symptoms,</p>
<p>it can last for 10 years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still in perimenopause.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like 20 years</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been tracking it so carefully.</p>
<p>It usually gets kicked off</p>
<p>by having your cycle get closer together.</p>
<p>So that can happen in your 30s or your 40s.</p>
<p>You go from 20 days to 25 days, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>You may notice that you start sleeping more poorly</p>
<p>because progesterone is so important.</p>
<p>You talked about that with Kyle.</p>
<p>You may notice it as more anxiety, difficulty sleeping,</p>
<p>and that probably is related to the estrogen receptor.</p>
<p>So ER alpha is, estrogen receptor alpha is angio.</p>
<p>It increases anxiety.</p>
<p>ER beta is associated with an anxiolytic activity.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a total of about six estrogen receptors.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s the G-protein coupled estrogen receptors,</p>
<p>and those are mixed, anxiolytic, anxiogenic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole period of perimenopause.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s most fascinating to me,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got to talk about this</p>
<p>either today or another time,</p>
<p>is that there is this massive, massive change</p>
<p>that happens in the female brain</p>
<p>that people are not talking about enough.</p>
<p>And so looking at the work of Lisa Moscone at Cornell,</p>
<p>from starting around age 40,</p>
<p>there is this massive change in cerebral metabolism.</p>
<p>So you can do FDG PET scans, you can look at glucose uptake,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s about, on average, a 20% decline</p>
<p>from premenopause, you know, up to like age 35,</p>
<p>to perimenopause, to postmenopause.</p>
<p>The women who are having the most symptoms</p>
<p>in perimenopause to menopause,</p>
<p>the hot flashes, the night sweats,</p>
<p>the difficulty sleeping,</p>
<p>those are the ones who have the most significant</p>
<p>cerebral hypometabolism.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to scare people with this language,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a low level,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s call it pseudo dementia of sorts.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems to be a phenotype</p>
<p>that you can then map to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s Lisa Moscone&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s looking at, okay,</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is not a disease of old age,</p>
<p>it is disease of middle age.</p>
<p>What are some of the biomarkers that we can define</p>
<p>that can tell you what your risk is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a mother and a grandmother</p>
<p>with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>you can believe I am all over this data.</p>
<p>And insulin resistance,</p>
<p>insulin insensitivity, as we talked about it before,</p>
<p>seems to be somewhere in there,</p>
<p>which I think when that first,</p>
<p>when that idea first surfaced,</p>
<p>a few people were like, really?</p>
<p>But then of course, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the brain is this incredibly</p>
<p>metabolically demanding organ.</p>
<p>You deprive neurons of fuel sources,</p>
<p>or you make them less sensitive to fuel sources.</p>
<p>They start dying, they certainly start firing less.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And I think now it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>thanks to Lisa&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>work that you&rsquo;ve done and talked about quite a lot</p>
<p>is in your books and elsewhere,</p>
<p>I think has really highlighted for people</p>
<p>that metabolism and metabolomics</p>
<p>is going to be as important as genes and genomics</p>
<p>when it comes to dementia,</p>
<p>perhaps, especially in women.</p>
<p>Is it safe to say that?</p>
<p>I think so, because</p>
<p>we believe that the system is regulated by estrogen.</p>
<p>So the decline in estrogen starting around age 40,</p>
<p>43 is kind of the average,</p>
<p>seems to be the driver behind cerebral hypometabolism.</p>
<p>The way I describe it to my patients is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like slow brain energy.</p>
<p>So you walk into a room, you can&rsquo;t remember why,</p>
<p>like you just notice that you can&rsquo;t manage all the tasks</p>
<p>the way that you once could.</p>
<p>Like things are just a little slower.</p>
<p>And I say that to women,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, I have that, like, help me.</p>
<p>So this is then circling back to WHI,</p>
<p>where women are scared to death of taking hormone therapy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got all of these women</p>
<p>that are marching toward potentially</p>
<p>a greater risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>And they have this opportunity in their 40s and their 50s</p>
<p>to take hormone therapy, and they may not be offered it.</p>
<p>Because the typical conventional approach based on WHI</p>
<p>is to say, unless you&rsquo;re having hot flashes</p>
<p>and night sweats that are severe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna give you hormone therapy.</p>
<p>And I just wanna call that out.</p>
<p>I would say, no, that is not the way to approach it.</p>
<p>Further,</p>
<p>the concept right now in conventional medicine</p>
<p>is that hot flashes and night sweats</p>
<p>are these nuisance symptoms</p>
<p>that we will take care of temporarily,</p>
<p>maybe with a little bit of estrogen and progesterone,</p>
<p>or a birth control pill, because it&rsquo;s given a lot.</p>
<p>Or that they pass.</p>
<p>Or that you just suck it up, suck it up.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you&rsquo;re not sleeping anymore.</p>
<p>Turn down the temperature in your room.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not right,</p>
<p>because hot flashes and night sweats</p>
<p>hot flashes and night sweats</p>
<p>are a biomarker of cardiometabolic disease.</p>
<p>They are a biomarker of increased bone loss.</p>
<p>They are a biomarker of changes in the brain.</p>
<p>So many of these symptoms that occur in perimenopause</p>
<p>are not driven by the ovaries.</p>
<p>They are driven by the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the bidirectional crosstalk</p>
<p>between the body and the brain keeps,</p>
<p>I think is the resounding theme.</p>
<p>We had Chris Palmer on here, a psychiatrist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s talking about ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for treatment of mental health.</p>
<p>I know we could have a whole other discussion,</p>
<p>and we will, I hope, if you&rsquo;ll agree to it,</p>
<p>about nutrition and, as it relates to hormones,</p>
<p>specific diets and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a question too,</p>
<p>whether this problem of cerebral hypometabolism,</p>
<p>could we solve it with estrogen</p>
<p>and or increased metabolic flexibility?</p>
<p>So I just wanted to footnote that.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p>Please interrupt.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re, as long as we&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>I know you are a fan in some instances</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and or ketogenic diet to get cells sensitive to insulin,</p>
<p>which is not to say, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>which is not to say that women need to stay</p>
<p>on the ketogenic diet for long periods of time</p>
<p>or intermittent fast by only time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>for eight hours or six hours a day,</p>
<p>but that by increasing,</p>
<p>you said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,</p>
<p>but by increasing cells&rsquo; sensitivity to insulin</p>
<p>and then maybe returning to a more typical eating pattern</p>
<p>and periodically switching back and forth,</p>
<p>that might actually be beneficial.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love the pulse.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s much more physiologic</p>
<p>than, say, going on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and staying there for years.</p>
<p>All of the data that we have on the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty limited in terms of duration.</p>
<p>The longest players that we have in terms of the data</p>
<p>are the folks with epilepsy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just a different phenotype.</p>
<p>So I think in terms of microbiome effects,</p>
<p>diversity, dysbiosis, some of those issues,</p>
<p>we really don&rsquo;t know in terms of long-term effects.</p>
<p>So I prefer with a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s used as an end-of-one experiment</p>
<p>and that you do it for four weeks.</p>
<p>Maybe you measure biomarkers before and afterwards.</p>
<p>Maybe you look at your stool before and afterwards,</p>
<p>and we still haven&rsquo;t talked about stool tests yet,</p>
<p>but you could measure your fasting insulin and your glucose.</p>
<p>You could just start there, do four weeks of keto,</p>
<p>clean keto, including vegetables.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be 57 a day,</p>
<p>and then measure it again afterwards.</p>
<p>Since you mentioned stool testing,</p>
<p>what is your recommendation about stool testing?</p>
<p>So my recommendation, this is, again,</p>
<p>in the field of if you have the disposable income.</p>
<p>So I usually start with Genova</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve got a good copay system with insurance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I typically use.</p>
<p>So I usually do their one-day stool test</p>
<p>where you have to go digging through your stool</p>
<p>and send it off to this lab that&rsquo;s in North Carolina.</p>
<p>I usually do the one-day</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m concerned about parasites.</p>
<p>In that case, I tend to do three days.</p>
<p>I do that for people who travel a fair amount</p>
<p>and go to places where there&rsquo;s greater risk</p>
<p>or they just have gut symptoms.</p>
<p>Another test that I do a lot is,</p>
<p>because I always like to mention two labs,</p>
<p>is a test by Wengevity.</p>
<p>And this is much more of a data wonk type of test</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s powered by AI.</p>
<p>It was designed by a guy who&rsquo;s got inflammatory bowel disease</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a PhD deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy</p>
<p>who wanted to make this really easy.</p>
<p>So the test is under the umbrella of THORN</p>
<p>and they used to call it GutBio.</p>
<p>They might have another name for it.</p>
<p>And they just improved it so that it&rsquo;s a wipe</p>
<p>instead of digging through your stool.</p>
<p>And so my athletes will do it now.</p>
<p>They were not so into digging through their stool before.</p>
<p>Is anybody?</p>
<p>Really, no one is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the answer to that.</p>
<p>I know the answer.</p>
<p>I prefer to that question.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a super interesting test</p>
<p>because you get much more dense data.</p>
<p>The issue is, with apologies to my friends at THORN,</p>
<p>the issue is that their recommendations</p>
<p>end up being THORN supplements.</p>
<p>So that can be very easy for people</p>
<p>who want to connect the dots.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not always the way that I like to do it.</p>
<p>First of all, three things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve shared with us an immense amount of knowledge.</p>
<p>And in that first statement, I also want to apologize</p>
<p>because I threw at you the entire lifespan</p>
<p>of a female lifespan, reproductive health,</p>
<p>contraception, diet, microbiome, so many things.</p>
<p>But I first, I just want to say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve taught me a tremendous amount,</p>
<p>including, I think, something that most people,</p>
<p>including myself, have not thought about enough,</p>
<p>which is the psychosocial impact</p>
<p>on things that we&rsquo;re all familiar with.</p>
<p>Constipation, bowel movements, what we eat, what we avoid.</p>
<p>I have to say, really, a huge thank you for that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s been discussed</p>
<p>on this podcast before.</p>
<p>Sort of know that brain communicates with body,</p>
<p>psychology and biology are linked.</p>
<p>But I think this is the first time</p>
<p>that anyone&rsquo;s ever directly linked circumstances</p>
<p>and biology and psychology in such a concrete way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>And I speak for many people on that.</p>
<p>Second of all, we barely scratched the surface</p>
<p>of your knowledge, which is both frustrating for me</p>
<p>because I always want to learn more</p>
<p>and I know many other people do as well,</p>
<p>but also very, very exciting</p>
<p>because hopefully without much persuasion,</p>
<p>we can have you back on to talk about things.</p>
<p>Like men&rsquo;s, I know you&rsquo;re working with men now,</p>
<p>men&rsquo;s health, some particulars around,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more for us to explore</p>
<p>in terms of PCOS, menopause, contraception</p>
<p>and all of the above.</p>
<p>But then something that you and I were talking about</p>
<p>off camera before we started,</p>
<p>which I think is a really important factor</p>
<p>that ties back to this issue of trauma and stress</p>
<p>and the bi-directional relationship</p>
<p>between biology and psychology.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we won&rsquo;t even separate those two,</p>
<p>which is the use of specific medicines,</p>
<p>including plant medicines</p>
<p>and how that can influence overall health,</p>
<p>which no doubt will include hormone health.</p>
<p>So I say all of that for two reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, to cue up the,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t even call it a part two,</p>
<p>but a sequel to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gratified to hear that you&rsquo;ll join us for that.</p>
<p>And then also to just really extend a huge thank you,</p>
<p>the amount of knowledge that you shared is immense</p>
<p>and is going to be very, very useful and actionable</p>
<p>for men in terms of their thinking and their actions</p>
<p>and for women in particular,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s discussion in particular for women</p>
<p>in terms of how to think about their health and biology,</p>
<p>how to think about their psychology</p>
<p>and the environment that all of that is embedded in.</p>
<p>I just want to say an enormous thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew.</p>
<p>I so appreciate that.</p>
<p>And I so appreciate what you offer to the world</p>
<p>in terms of a way in, a way to understand physiology</p>
<p>and how to craft a architect, a better life.</p>
<p>Can I just add one last thing?</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>since we didn&rsquo;t get to the forties and the fifties</p>
<p>in this list of biomarkers.</p>
<p>So I feel like if people,</p>
<p>if women went away with one thing today,</p>
<p>it would be to do a coronary artery calcium score</p>
<p>by age 45 and sooner if you&rsquo;ve got premature heart disease.</p>
<p>How is that taken?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a CT scan of the chest.</p>
<p>You can self-order it.</p>
<p>Like I think at Stanford Hospital, you can self-order it.</p>
<p>Last time a patient checked, it was $250.</p>
<p>So again, disposable income, but it tells you,</p>
<p>it almost gives you this fork in the road</p>
<p>in terms of how much you need to pay attention</p>
<p>to cardiometabolic health as a woman.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a 45 for men too.</p>
<p>So if you haven&rsquo;t had one, have you had one?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You need one.</p>
<p>Insulin, cortisol, CAC.</p>
<p>Great, I&rsquo;ll run all that by you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really essential.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some women who have a zero.</p>
<p>So my score is zero and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So often you can just keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re 45 and you&rsquo;re starting to be elevated</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got, you know, maybe you&rsquo;ve got PCOS</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got some other biomarkers</p>
<p>tending you in this direction toward the number one killer,</p>
<p>really eight to nine out of the top 10 killers in the US,</p>
<p>that allows you to really start to make changes.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s essential to know that data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s probably not going to be offered</p>
<p>by your doctor.</p>
<p>Certainly Peter Atiyah is going to offer it,</p>
<p>but most conventional doctors are not going to do it.</p>
<p>And then the last thing I want to say.</p>
<p>So if I were to go to my doctor and I just say,</p>
<p>I want a cardiac calcium score,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people should ask.</p>
<p>Coronary artery calcium score, CAC.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So everyone hear that and know that if you&rsquo;re 40 or older</p>
<p>and maybe if you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>45.</p>
<p>45 or older, get it.</p>
<p>So the last thing is, and this is for men and women,</p>
<p>is your ACE score.</p>
<p>So adverse childhood experiences.</p>
<p>Knowing your ACE score is so essential</p>
<p>in terms of a baseline for how much trauma your system,</p>
<p>your pine system endured when you were a kid.</p>
<p>And we know that childhood trauma,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s abuse or neglect</p>
<p>or having an alcoholic parent,</p>
<p>that maps to disease in middle age.</p>
<p>And it can give you so much insight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a patient who had</p>
<p>an elevated coronary artery calcium score</p>
<p>who does everything right with her food.</p>
<p>I think it was her trauma that elevated her CAC</p>
<p>when she was 45.</p>
<p>So I think an ACE score, knowing your ACE score,</p>
<p>starting as a teenager, like knowing it</p>
<p>and knowing how to work with that is really essential.</p>
<p>There are certain people, they are exceedingly rare,</p>
<p>but you are one such person that when they speak,</p>
<p>knowledge just comes out of them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredibly useful and helpful knowledge.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get both of those things.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And I highly recommend that everyone else pursue ways</p>
<p>that they can get those,</p>
<p>or if they can&rsquo;t get them,</p>
<p>that they earmark those as things to get</p>
<p>at the point where they can obtain</p>
<p>sufficient disposable income.</p>
<p>Sounds like that the health,</p>
<p>the detriments to health that those can offset</p>
<p>would be well worth the cost.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>

<p>And I should mention that on both Instagram and Twitter,</p>
<p>I cover science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health and performance,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media channels.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>so-called Neural Network Newsletter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely zero cost.</p>
<p>And we provide summaries of podcast episodes</p>
<p>as well as summaries of tools for everything</p>
<p>from optimizing sleep to hormone health,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>fitness, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to sign up for.</p>
<p>You go to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu and scroll to newsletter.</p>
<p>You simply provide your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, it is completely zero cost.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the Neural Network Newsletter</p>
<p>and you can find it at HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for everything from sleep to focus to hormone regulation.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is happy to announce</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>Also, they include many single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>which is essential if you want to design</p>
<p>a supplement regimen that is both cost-effective</p>
<p>and the most biologically effective supplement regimen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very hard to do with blends of supplements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very straightforward to do</p>
<p>with single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>Also, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>which is important because we realize</p>
<p>that many of you reside outside of the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s LiveMomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for joining me for today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>all about female hormone health, vitality, and longevity</p>
<p>with Dr. Sarah Gottfried.</p>
<p>And last but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
