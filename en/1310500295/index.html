    <p>The following is a conversation with Jonathan Haidt,</p>
<p>social psychologist at NYU</p>
<p>and critic of the negative effects of social media</p>
<p>on the human mind and human civilization.</p>
<p>He gives a respectful but hard hitting response</p>
<p>to my conversation with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>And together, him and I try to figure out</p>
<p>how we can do better,</p>
<p>how we can lessen the amount of depression</p>
<p>and division in the world.</p>
<p>He has brilliantly discussed these topics in his writing,</p>
<p>including in his book,</p>
<p>The Coddling of the American Mind</p>
<p>and in his recent long article in the Atlantic</p>
<p>titled, Why the Past 10 Years of American Life</p>
<p>Have Been Uniquely Stupid.</p>
<p>When Teddy Roosevelt said in his famous speech</p>
<p>that it is not the critic who counts,</p>
<p>he has not yet read</p>
<p>the brilliant writing of Jonathan Haidt.</p>
<p>I disagree with John on some of the details</p>
<p>of his analysis and ideas,</p>
<p>but both his criticism and our disagreement is essential</p>
<p>if we are to build better</p>
<p>and better technologies that connect us.</p>
<p>Social media has both the power to destroy our society</p>
<p>and to help it flourish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to us to figure out how we take the latter path.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Un-Cruise for adventure,</p>
<p>Notion for startups,</p>
<p>Blinkist for nonfiction,</p>
<p>Magic for snacks</p>
<p>and Eight Sleep for sweet, sweet naps.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>No ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I hate those.</p>
<p>I try to make these ad reads interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Un-Cruise Adventures,</p>
<p>small ships, cruises, sailing to Alaska,</p>
<p>Mexico, Costa Rica, Hawaii, and so on.</p>
<p>You can go hiking, kayaking, whale watching</p>
<p>and seeing the Northern lights.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something not just humbling,</p>
<p>but somehow revealing about who we are,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing here when you look at nature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the calmness,</p>
<p>the quiet of water stretching out to the horizon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about trees as far as the eye can see</p>
<p>that reminds you what this is all about.</p>
<p>And somehow it&rsquo;s impossible to put into words.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s great to take little journeys like this.</p>
<p>You can save $500 on Alaskan adventures through June</p>
<p>for bookings made within 30 days of departure.</p>
<p>Go to uncruise.com slash pages slash flex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Notion,</p>
<p>a note-taking and team collaboration tool.</p>
<p>It combines note-taking, document sharing,</p>
<p>wikis, project management, and much, much, much more</p>
<p>into one space that&rsquo;s simple, powerful,</p>
<p>and beautifully designed.</p>
<p>Obviously I&rsquo;ve been using Notion for a long time now.</p>
<p>What I really mean to say is all the cool kids</p>
<p>have been telling me for a long time about Notion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m originally, if I might admit, an Emacs person,</p>
<p>so a lot of the, in terms of an IDE perspective,</p>
<p>what I use for programming is still Emacs,</p>
<p>but much, much less so.</p>
<p>I use the more optimized tools for the job.</p>
<p>For note-taking specifically,</p>
<p>Notion is just far above anything else I&rsquo;ve used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible tool, and it&rsquo;s also good for the work,</p>
<p>the company setting, the startup setting.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re running a special offer for startups.</p>
<p>You can get up to $1,000 off the team plan.</p>
<p>To give you a sense,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost a year of free Notion for a team of 10.</p>
<p>Go to notion.com slash startups.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>Blinkist takes the key ideas</p>
<p>from thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>and condenses them down into just 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>unfortunately, is not on there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many books about Hitler or Stalin on there,</p>
<p>perhaps for a good reason.</p>
<p>But the best, I would say, nonfiction books</p>
<p>are all on there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about Sapiens,</p>
<p>Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, it goes on and on.</p>
<p>I use it for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>So one, of course, is to review the books I&rsquo;ve already read.</p>
<p>Two is to select the books I want to read in the future.</p>
<p>And three, perhaps most powerfully,</p>
<p>is books that I just don&rsquo;t have time to read</p>
<p>but are culturally and intellectually important.</p>
<p>This life is about hard choices.</p>
<p>And for the books you don&rsquo;t choose,</p>
<p>sometimes Blinkist can save your ass.</p>
<p>As a listener, you can get a free seven-day trial</p>
<p>and 25% off of a Blinkist premium membership</p>
<p>at blinkist.com slash flex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you</p>
<p>by an old and favorite sponsor of this podcast.</p>
<p>My fellow travelers on this journey of the podcast</p>
<p>is Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Something beautiful that this podcast was originally</p>
<p>and still sponsored by Cereal.</p>
<p>And that connects to my sort of teen years</p>
<p>when cereal was such a source of joy,</p>
<p>but it was also a source of gigantic amount of sugar.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the case with Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s low-carb, keto-friendly, zero grams of sugar,</p>
<p>13 to 14 grams of protein, only four net grams of carbs,</p>
<p>140 calories in each serving, and it&rsquo;s freaking delicious.</p>
<p>My favorite flavor is cocoa.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of other ones.</p>
<p>Peanut butter&rsquo;s pretty good too.</p>
<p>They have a 100% happiness guarantee.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t like it, they refund it.</p>
<p>Nothing else in life, I would say,</p>
<p>has a 100% happiness guarantee.</p>
<p>So maybe you should look to Magic Spoon</p>
<p>to get such guarantees about happiness</p>
<p>because the rest of life is full of suffering, friends.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pod pro mattress.</p>
<p>There are very few things I enjoy as much as a good nap,</p>
<p>even more than sleep sometimes.</p>
<p>A good nap, like 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sometimes actually drink coffee right before,</p>
<p>take the nap, and I&rsquo;ll wake up refreshed in a way</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t feel refreshed in any other condition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something magical about this power nap.</p>
<p>And I am ready to take on the day,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s like 11 p.m. at night.</p>
<p>And then I ruin my whole sleep schedule,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t matter because happiness is what matters.</p>
<p>And the best way to achieve happiness</p>
<p>is a nap on an Eight Sleep mattress</p>
<p>or Eight Sleep pod pro cover on top of a mattress.</p>
<p>They have said pod pro cover</p>
<p>that you can just add to your own mattress.</p>
<p>You can get theirs too, up to you.</p>
<p>You can do all this at eightsleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>And you can save $200 at checkout from the pod pro cover.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep currently ships</p>
<p>within the United States of A, Canada,</p>
<p>and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Enjoy your sleep.</p>
<p>Enjoy your nap, friends.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jonathan Haidt.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>So you have been thinking about the human mind</p>
<p>for quite a long time.</p>
<p>You wrote The Happiness Hypothesis,</p>
<p>The Righteous Mind, The Coddling of the American Mind.</p>
<p>And today you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re writing a lot about social media and about democracy.</p>
<p>So perhaps if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go through the thread that connects all of that work.</p>
<p>How do we get from the very beginning to today</p>
<p>with the good, the bad, and the ugly of social media?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a social psychologist,</p>
<p>which means I study how we think about other people</p>
<p>and how people affect our thinking.</p>
<p>And in graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>I picked the topic of moral psychology.</p>
<p>And I studied how morality varied across countries.</p>
<p>I studied in Brazil and India.</p>
<p>And in the 90s, I began, this was like,</p>
<p>I got my PhD in 1992.</p>
<p>And in that decade was really when the American culture war</p>
<p>kind of really began to blow up.</p>
<p>And I began to notice that left and right in this country</p>
<p>were becoming like separate countries.</p>
<p>And you could use the tools of cultural psychology</p>
<p>to study this split,</p>
<p>this moral battle between left and right.</p>
<p>So I started doing that.</p>
<p>And I began growing alarmed in the early 2000s</p>
<p>about how bad polarization was getting.</p>
<p>And I began studying the causes of polarization,</p>
<p>bringing moral psychology to bear on our political problems.</p>
<p>And I was originally gonna write a book</p>
<p>to basically help the Democrats stop screwing up</p>
<p>because I could see that some of my research showed</p>
<p>people on the right understand people on the left.</p>
<p>They know what they think.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t grow up in America</p>
<p>without knowing what progressives think.</p>
<p>But here I grew up generally on the left</p>
<p>and I had no idea what conservatives thought</p>
<p>until I went and sought it out</p>
<p>and started reading conservative things</p>
<p>like National Review.</p>
<p>So originally I wanted to actually help the Democrats</p>
<p>to understand moral psychology</p>
<p>so they could stop losing to George W. Bush.</p>
<p>And I got a contract to write The Righteous Mind.</p>
<p>And once I started writing it,</p>
<p>I committed to understanding conservatives</p>
<p>by reading the best writings, not the worst.</p>
<p>And I discovered, you know what?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand anything</p>
<p>until you look from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>And I discovered there are a lot of great</p>
<p>social science ideas</p>
<p>in the conservative intellectual tradition.</p>
<p>And so, and I also began to see, you know what?</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s actually in real trouble.</p>
<p>And this is like 2008, 2009.</p>
<p>Things are really, we&rsquo;re coming apart here.</p>
<p>So I began to really focus my research</p>
<p>on helping left and right understand each other</p>
<p>and helping our democratic institutions to work better.</p>
<p>Okay, so all this is before I had any interest</p>
<p>in social media.</p>
<p>I was on Twitter, I guess like 2009 and not much.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think about it much.</p>
<p>And then, so I&rsquo;m going along</p>
<p>as a social psychologist studying this.</p>
<p>And then everything seems to kind of blow up</p>
<p>in 2014, 2015 at universities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Greg Lukianoff came to me in May of 2014</p>
<p>and said, John, weird stuff is happening.</p>
<p>Students are freaking out about a speaker coming to campus</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have to go see.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s dangerous, it&rsquo;s violent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what is going on?</p>
<p>And so anyway, Greg&rsquo;s ideas about how</p>
<p>we were teaching students to think in distorted ways</p>
<p>that led us to write the Coddling the American Mind,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t primarily about social media either.</p>
<p>It was about this sort of a rise of depression, anxiety.</p>
<p>But after that, things got so much worse everywhere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I began to think like,</p>
<p>whoa, something systemically has changed.</p>
<p>Something has changed about the fabric</p>
<p>of the social universe.</p>
<p>And so ever since then, I&rsquo;ve been focused on social media.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to try to sneak up to the problems</p>
<p>and the solutions at hand from different directions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions whether it&rsquo;s fundamentally</p>
<p>the nature of social media that&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the decisions of various human beings</p>
<p>that lead the social media companies that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Is there still some component that&rsquo;s highlighted</p>
<p>in the Coddling of the American Mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the individual psychology at play</p>
<p>or the way parenting and education works</p>
<p>to make sort of emphasize anti-fragility of the human mind</p>
<p>as it interacts with the social media platforms</p>
<p>and the other humans through the social,</p>
<p>so all that beautiful mess.</p>
<p>That should take us an hour or two to cover.</p>
<p>Or maybe a couple of years, yes.</p>
<p>But, so let&rsquo;s start, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You said you wanted to challenge some of the things</p>
<p>that Mark Zuckerberg has said in a conversation with me.</p>
<p>What are some of the ideas he expressed</p>
<p>that you disagree with?</p>
<p>Okay, there are two major areas that I study.</p>
<p>One is what is happening with teen mental health?</p>
<p>It fell off a cliff in 2013.</p>
<p>It was very sudden.</p>
<p>And then the other is what is happening</p>
<p>to our democratic and epistemic institutions?</p>
<p>That means knowledge generating</p>
<p>like universities, journalism.</p>
<p>So my main areas of research</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m collecting the empirical research</p>
<p>and trying to make sense of it</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s happened to teen mental health</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the evidence that social media is a contributor?</p>
<p>And then the other area is what&rsquo;s happening to democracies,</p>
<p>not just America, and what&rsquo;s the evidence</p>
<p>that social media is a contributor to the dysfunction?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get to that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the Atlantic article is about.</p>
<p>But if we focus first on what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>to teen mental health.</p>
<p>So before I read the quotes from Mark,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just give the overview.</p>
<p>And it is this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of data tracking adolescents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s self-reports of how depressed, anxious, lonely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s data on hospital admissions for self-harm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s data on suicide.</p>
<p>And all of these things, they bounce around somewhat,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re relatively level in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, around 2010 to 2013,</p>
<p>depending on which statistic you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>all of a sudden, they begin to shoot upwards.</p>
<p>More so for girls in some cases,</p>
<p>but on the whole, it&rsquo;s like up for both sexes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that boys have lower levels</p>
<p>of anxiety and depression,</p>
<p>so the curve is not quite as dramatic.</p>
<p>But what we see is not small increases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, 10%, 20%.</p>
<p>No, the increases are between 50 and 150%,</p>
<p>depending on which group you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Suicide for preteen girls, thankfully, it&rsquo;s not very common,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s two to three times more common now.</p>
<p>Or by 2015, it had doubled.</p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2015, it doubled.</p>
<p>So something is going radically wrong</p>
<p>in the world of American preteens.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been studying it, I found, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s identical in Canada and the UK.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are very similar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just after a little delay.</p>
<p>So whatever we&rsquo;re looking for here,</p>
<p>but yet it&rsquo;s not as clear in the Germanic countries.</p>
<p>In continental Europe, it&rsquo;s a little different,</p>
<p>and we can get into that when we talk about childhood.</p>
<p>But something&rsquo;s happening in many countries,</p>
<p>and it started right around 2012, 2013.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t gradual.</p>
<p>It hit girls hardest, and it hit preteen girls the hardest.</p>
<p>So what could it be?</p>
<p>Nobody has come up with another explanation.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the financial crisis.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t have hit preteen girls the hardest.</p>
<p>There is no other explanation.</p>
<p>The complexity here in the data is, of course,</p>
<p>as everyone knows, correlation doesn&rsquo;t prove causation.</p>
<p>The fact that television viewing was going up</p>
<p>in the 60s and 70s doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that that was the cause of the crime.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve done, and this is work with Jean Twenge,</p>
<p>who wrote the book iGen, is because I was challenged,</p>
<p>when Greg and I put out the book,</p>
<p>The Coddling of the American Mind,</p>
<p>some researchers challenged us and said,</p>
<p>oh, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>The correlations between social media use and mental health,</p>
<p>they exist, but they&rsquo;re tiny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a correlation coefficient of 0.03</p>
<p>or a beta of 0.05, tiny little things.</p>
<p>And one famous article said it&rsquo;s no bigger</p>
<p>than the correlation of bad mental health</p>
<p>and eating potatoes, which exists,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so tiny it&rsquo;s zero, essentially.</p>
<p>And that claim, that social media&rsquo;s no more harmful</p>
<p>than eating potatoes or wearing eyeglasses,</p>
<p>it was a very catchy claim, and it&rsquo;s caught on,</p>
<p>and I keep hearing that.</p>
<p>But let me unpack why that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get to what Mark said,</p>
<p>because what Mark basically said,</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;ll actually read it.</p>
<p>I might wanna read the quote.</p>
<p>And by the way, just to pause real quick,</p>
<p>is you implied, but just to make it explicit,</p>
<p>that the best explanation we have now,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re proposing, is that a very particular aspect</p>
<p>of social media is the cause,</p>
<p>which is not just social media,</p>
<p>but the like button and the retweet,</p>
<p>a certain mechanism of virality that was invented,</p>
<p>or perhaps some aspect of social media is the cause.</p>
<p>Okay, good idea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>Connecting people is good.</p>
<p>I mean, overall, the more you connect people, the better.</p>
<p>Giving people the telephone was an amazing step forward.</p>
<p>Giving them free telephone, free long distance,</p>
<p>is even better.</p>
<p>Video is, I mean, so connecting people is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Luddite.</p>
<p>And social media, at least the idea of users posting things,</p>
<p>like that happens on LinkedIn, and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It can serve all kinds of needs.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here is not the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not smartphones.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even all social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular business model</p>
<p>in which people are incentivized to create content.</p>
<p>And that content is what brings other people on.</p>
<p>And the people on there are the product,</p>
<p>which is sold to advertisers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that particular business model,</p>
<p>which Facebook pioneered,</p>
<p>which seems to be incredibly harmful for teenagers,</p>
<p>especially for young girls, 10 to 14 years old</p>
<p>is where they&rsquo;re most vulnerable.</p>
<p>And it seems to be particularly harmful</p>
<p>for democratic institutions</p>
<p>because it leads to all kinds of anger, conflict,</p>
<p>and the destruction of any shared narrative.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about Facebook, Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any data on TikTok.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s gonna end up being,</p>
<p>having a lot of really bad effects</p>
<p>because the teens are on it so much.</p>
<p>And to be really clear,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re doing the nuance now in this section,</p>
<p>lots of good stuff happens.</p>
<p>I, you know, a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of funny things on Twitter.</p>
<p>I use Twitter because it&rsquo;s an amazing way to put out news,</p>
<p>to put out when I write something,</p>
<p>you know, you and I, you know, use it to promote things.</p>
<p>We learn things quickly.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s could be,</p>
<p>now this is harder to measure</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to mention it</p>
<p>because so much of our conversation</p>
<p>will be about rigorous criticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to sometimes mention</p>
<p>what are the possible positive effects</p>
<p>of social media in different ways.</p>
<p>So for example, in the way I&rsquo;ve been using Twitter,</p>
<p>not the promotion or any of that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it makes me feel less lonely</p>
<p>to connect with people,</p>
<p>to make me smile, a little bit of humor here and there.</p>
<p>And that at scale is a very interesting effect,</p>
<p>being connected across the globe,</p>
<p>especially during times of COVID and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to measure that.</p>
<p>So we kind of have to consider that</p>
<p>and be honest that there is a trade-off.</p>
<p>We have to be honest about the positive and the negative</p>
<p>and sometimes we&rsquo;re not sufficiently positive</p>
<p>or in a rigorous scientific way about the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not rigorous in a scientific way about the negative</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do here.</p>
<p>And so that brings us to the Mark Zuckerberg email.</p>
<p>Okay, but wait,</p>
<p>let me just pick up on the issue of trade-offs</p>
<p>because people might think like,</p>
<p>well, like how much of this do we need?</p>
<p>If we have too much, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a one-dimensional conceptualization.</p>
<p>This is a multi-dimensional issue.</p>
<p>And a lot of people seem to think like,</p>
<p>oh, what would we have done</p>
<p>without social media during COVID?</p>
<p>Like we would have been sitting there alone in our homes.</p>
<p>Yeah, if all we had was, you know,</p>
<p>texting, telephone, Zoom, Skype, multiplayer video games,</p>
<p>WhatsApp, all sorts of ways of communicating with each other.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s blogs and the rest of the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, we would have been fine.</p>
<p>Did we really need the hyper-viral platforms</p>
<p>of Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>Now those did help certain things get out faster</p>
<p>and that did help science Twitter sometimes,</p>
<p>but it also led to huge explosions of misinformation</p>
<p>and the polarization of our politics to such an extent</p>
<p>that a third of the country, you know,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe what the medical establishment was saying.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into this.</p>
<p>The medical establishment sometimes</p>
<p>was playing political games that made them less credible.</p>
<p>So on net, it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;ve got the internet, smartphones, blogs,</p>
<p>all of that stuff, it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>that adding in this particular business model</p>
<p>of Facebook, Twitter, TikTok,</p>
<p>that that really adds a lot more.</p>
<p>And one interesting one we&rsquo;ll also talk about is YouTube.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier to talk about Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>YouTube is another complex beast that&rsquo;s very hard to,</p>
<p>because YouTube has many things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a content platform,</p>
<p>but it also has a recommendation system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s focus our discussion</p>
<p>on perhaps Twitter and Facebook,</p>
<p>but you do in this large document</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re putting together on social media</p>
<p>called Social Media and Political Dysfunction</p>
<p>Collaborative Review with Chris Bale.</p>
<p>That includes, I believe, papers on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>But yeah, again, just to finish up with the nuance,</p>
<p>yeah, YouTube is really complicated</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t imagine life without YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly useful.</p>
<p>It does a lot of good things.</p>
<p>It also obviously helps to radicalize terrorist groups</p>
<p>and murderers.</p>
<p>So I think about YouTube</p>
<p>the way I think about the internet in general,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know enough to really comment on YouTube.</p>
<p>So I have been focused, and it&rsquo;s also interesting.</p>
<p>One thing we know is teen social life change radically</p>
<p>between about 2010 and 2012.</p>
<p>Before 2010, they weren&rsquo;t mostly on every day</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t have smartphones yet.</p>
<p>By 2012 to 14, that&rsquo;s the area</p>
<p>in which they almost all get smartphones</p>
<p>and they become daily users of the girls.</p>
<p>So the girls go to Instagram and Tumblr.</p>
<p>They go to the visual ones.</p>
<p>The boys go to YouTube and video games.</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t seem to be as harmful to mental health</p>
<p>or even harmful at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really Tumblr, Instagram particularly,</p>
<p>that seem to really have done in girls&rsquo; mental health.</p>
<p>So now, okay, so let&rsquo;s look at the quote</p>
<p>from Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>So at 64 minutes and 31 seconds on the video,</p>
<p>I time-coded this.</p>
<p>This is excellent.</p>
<p>This is the very helpful YouTube transcript.</p>
<p>YouTube&rsquo;s an amazing program.</p>
<p>You ask him about Francis Haugen.</p>
<p>You give him a chance to respond.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>So he talks about what Francis Haugen said.</p>
<p>He said, no, but that&rsquo;s mischaracterized.</p>
<p>Actually, on most measures, the kids are doing better</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re on Instagram.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just on one out of the 18.</p>
<p>And then he says, I think an accurate characterization</p>
<p>would have been that kids using Instagram,</p>
<p>or not kids, but teens,</p>
<p>is generally positive for their mental health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his claim, that Instagram is overall,</p>
<p>taken as a whole, Instagram is positive</p>
<p>for their mental health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he says, okay?</p>
<p>Now, is it really, is it really?</p>
<p>So first, just the simple, okay, now here,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d like to do is turn my attention</p>
<p>to another document that we&rsquo;ll make available.</p>
<p>So I was invited to give testimony</p>
<p>before a Senate subcommittee two weeks ago,</p>
<p>where they were considering</p>
<p>the Platform Accountability Act.</p>
<p>Should we force the platforms to actually tell us</p>
<p>what our kids are doing?</p>
<p>Like, we have no idea, other than self-report.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re the only ones who know,</p>
<p>like, the kid does this, and then over the next hours,</p>
<p>the kid&rsquo;s depressed or happy.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t know that, but Facebook knows it.</p>
<p>So should they be compelled to reveal the data?</p>
<p>We need that.</p>
<p>So you raised just, to give people a little bit of context,</p>
<p>and this document is brilliantly structured</p>
<p>with questions, studies that indicate</p>
<p>that the answer to a question is yes</p>
<p>indicate that the answer to a question is no,</p>
<p>and then mixed results.</p>
<p>And questions include things like,</p>
<p>does social media make people more angry</p>
<p>or effectively polarized?</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s the one that we&rsquo;re gonna get to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one for democracy.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s for democracy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got three different Google Docs here,</p>
<p>because I found this is an amazing way,</p>
<p>and thank God for Google Docs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing way to organize the research literature,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a collaborator review,</p>
<p>so on this one, Gene Twenge and I put up the first draft,</p>
<p>and we say, please, comment, add studies,</p>
<p>tell us what we missed.</p>
<p>And it evolves in real time.</p>
<p>In any direction, the yes or the no.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we specifically encourage,</p>
<p>because look, the center of my research</p>
<p>is that our gut feelings drive our reasoning.</p>
<p>That was my dissertation, that was my early research.</p>
<p>And so if Gene Twenge and I are committed to,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna obviously preferentially believe</p>
<p>that these platforms are bad for kids,</p>
<p>because we said so in our books.</p>
<p>So we have confirmation bias,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a devotee of John Stuart Mill.</p>
<p>The only cure for confirmation bias</p>
<p>is other people who have a different confirmation bias.</p>
<p>So these documents evolve,</p>
<p>because critics then say, no, you missed this,</p>
<p>or they say, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, great, say so, tell us.</p>
<p>So I put together this document,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna put links to everything on my website.</p>
<p>If users, sorry, if listeners, viewers,</p>
<p>go to jonathanheit.com slash social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new page I just created.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put everything together in one place there,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll put those in the show notes.</p>
<p>Like links to this document,</p>
<p>and other things like it that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, exactly.</p>
<p>So yeah, so the thing I wanna call attention to now</p>
<p>is this document here with the title,</p>
<p>Teen Mental Health is Plummeting,</p>
<p>and Social Media is a Major Contributing Cause.</p>
<p>So Ben Sass and Chris Coons are on the Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>They had a subcommittee hearing</p>
<p>on Nate Priscilli&rsquo;s bill,</p>
<p>Platform Accountability Transparency Act.</p>
<p>So they asked me to testify on what do we know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with teen mental health.</p>
<p>And so what I did was I put together everything I know</p>
<p>with plenty of graphs to make these points.</p>
<p>That first, what do we know about the crisis?</p>
<p>Well, that the crisis is specific to mood disorders,</p>
<p>not everything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just self-report, it&rsquo;s also behavioral data,</p>
<p>because suicide and self-harm go skyrocketing after 2010.</p>
<p>The increases are very large,</p>
<p>and the crisis is gendered, and it&rsquo;s hit many countries.</p>
<p>So I go through the data on that.</p>
<p>So we have a pretty clear characterization,</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s disputed me on this part.</p>
<p>So can we just pause real quick,</p>
<p>just so for people who are not aware.</p>
<p>So self-report, just how you kind of collect data</p>
<p>on this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You have a self-report, a survey, you ask people.</p>
<p>Yeah, how anxious are you these days?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How many hours a week do you use social media?</p>
<p>That kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And you do, it&rsquo;s maybe,</p>
<p>you can collect large amounts of data that way,</p>
<p>because you can ask a large number of people</p>
<p>that kind of question.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s, I forget the term you use,</p>
<p>but more, so non-self-report data.</p>
<p>Behavioral data.</p>
<p>Behavioral data, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Where you actually have self-harm and suicide numbers.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of graphs like this.</p>
<p>So this is from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</p>
<p>So the federal government, and also Pew and Gallup,</p>
<p>there are a lot of organizations</p>
<p>that have been collecting survey data for decades.</p>
<p>So this is a gold mine.</p>
<p>And what you see on these graphs over and over again</p>
<p>is relatively straight lines up until around 2010 or 2012.</p>
<p>And on the x-axis, we have time,</p>
<p>years going from 2004 to 2020.</p>
<p>On the y-axis is the percent of US teens</p>
<p>who had a major depression in the last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So when this data started coming out around,</p>
<p>so Jean Twain&rsquo;s book, iGen, 2017,</p>
<p>a lot of people said, oh, she doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what she&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>This is just self-report.</p>
<p>Like Gen Z, they&rsquo;re just really comfortable</p>
<p>talking about this.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a real epidemic.</p>
<p>And literally the day before my book with Greg was published,</p>
<p>the day before, there was a psychiatrist in New York Times</p>
<p>who had an op-ed saying, relax,</p>
<p>smartphones are not ruining your kid&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>And he said, it&rsquo;s just self-report.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re giving higher rates,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more diagnosis.</p>
<p>But underlying, there&rsquo;s no change.</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s theoretically possible,</p>
<p>but all we have to do is look at the hospitalization data</p>
<p>for self-harm and suicide, and we see the exact same trends.</p>
<p>We see also a very sudden, big rise around,</p>
<p>between 2009 and 2012, you have an elbow,</p>
<p>and then it goes up, up, up.</p>
<p>So, and that is not self-report.</p>
<p>Those are actual kids admitted to hospitals</p>
<p>for cutting themselves.</p>
<p>So we have a catastrophe, and this was all true before COVID.</p>
<p>COVID made things worse, but we have to realize,</p>
<p>COVID&rsquo;s going away, kids are back in school,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not gonna go back to where we were</p>
<p>because this problem is not caused by COVID.</p>
<p>What is it caused by?</p>
<p>Well, just again, to just go through the point,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>I just feel like I wanna get out the data</p>
<p>to show that Mark is wrong.</p>
<p>So first point, correlational studies</p>
<p>consistently show a link.</p>
<p>They almost all do, but it&rsquo;s not big.</p>
<p>Equivalent to a correlation coefficient</p>
<p>around 0.1, typically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first point.</p>
<p>The second point is that the correlation</p>
<p>is actually much larger than for eating potatoes.</p>
<p>So that famous line wasn&rsquo;t about social media use.</p>
<p>That was about digital media use.</p>
<p>That included watching Netflix,</p>
<p>doing homework on everything.</p>
<p>And so what they did is they looked at all screen use,</p>
<p>and then they said, this is correlated</p>
<p>with self-reports of depression, anxiety,</p>
<p>like, you know, 0.03, it&rsquo;s tiny.</p>
<p>And they said that clearly in the paper,</p>
<p>but the media has reported it as social media</p>
<p>is 0.03 or tiny, and that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>What I found digging into it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know this until you look at the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more than 100 studies in the Google Doc.</p>
<p>Once you dig in, what you see is,</p>
<p>okay, you see a tiny correlation.</p>
<p>What happens if we zoom in on just social media?</p>
<p>It always gets bigger, often a lot bigger,</p>
<p>two or three times bigger.</p>
<p>What happens if we zoom in on girls and social media?</p>
<p>It always gets bigger, often a lot bigger.</p>
<p>And so what I think we can conclude,</p>
<p>in fact, what one of the authors</p>
<p>of the potato studies herself concludes,</p>
<p>Amy Orban says, I think I have a quote from here.</p>
<p>She reviewed a lot of studies,</p>
<p>and she herself said that, quote,</p>
<p>the associations between social media use and wellbeing</p>
<p>therefore range from about R equals 0.15 to R equals 0.10.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the range we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for boys and girls together.</p>
<p>And a lot of research, including hers and mine,</p>
<p>show that girls, it&rsquo;s higher.</p>
<p>So for girls, we&rsquo;re talking about correlations</p>
<p>around 0.15 to 0.2, I believe.</p>
<p>Gene Twenge and I found it&rsquo;s about 0.2 or 0.22.</p>
<p>Now this might sound like an arcane social science debate,</p>
<p>but people have to understand,</p>
<p>public health correlations are almost never above 0.2.</p>
<p>So the correlation of childhood exposure to lead</p>
<p>and adult IQ, very serious problem, that&rsquo;s 0.09.</p>
<p>Like the world&rsquo;s messy and our measurements are messy.</p>
<p>And so if you find a consistent correlation of 0.15,</p>
<p>like you would never let your kid do that thing.</p>
<p>That actually is dangerous.</p>
<p>And it can explain when you multiply it</p>
<p>over tens of millions of kids spending,</p>
<p>you know, years of their lives,</p>
<p>you actually can explain the mental health epidemic</p>
<p>just from social media use.</p>
<p>Well, and then there&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>By the way, this is really good to learn</p>
<p>because I quit potatoes and it had no effect on me.</p>
<p>And as a Russian, that was a big sacrifice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re quite literal actually,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m mostly eating keto these days.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s funny that they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>literally called the potato studies.</p>
<p>Okay, but given this,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating data here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a discussion of how to fix it.</p>
<p>What are the aspects that if fixed</p>
<p>would start to reverse some of these trends?</p>
<p>So if we just linger on the set</p>
<p>of the Mark Zuckerberg statements.</p>
<p>So first of all, do you think Mark is aware</p>
<p>of some of these studies?</p>
<p>So if you put yourself in the shoes of Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>and the executives at Facebook and Twitter,</p>
<p>how can you try to understand the studies</p>
<p>like the Google Docs you put together</p>
<p>to try to make decisions that fix things?</p>
<p>Is there a stable science now</p>
<p>that you can start to investigate?</p>
<p>And also maybe if you can comment</p>
<p>on the depth of data that&rsquo;s available,</p>
<p>because ultimately, and this is something you argue,</p>
<p>that the data should be more transparent,</p>
<p>it should be provided.</p>
<p>But currently, if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>all you have is maybe some leaks of internal data.</p>
<p>And we could talk about the potential.</p>
<p>You have to be very sort of objective</p>
<p>about the potential bias in those kinds of leaks.</p>
<p>You want to, it would be nice to have a non-leak data.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be nice to be able to actually</p>
<p>have academic researchers able to access</p>
<p>in de-individuated, de-identified form</p>
<p>the actual data on what kids are doing</p>
<p>and how their mood changes.</p>
<p>And when people commit suicide,</p>
<p>what was happening before,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be great to know that.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>So how do we begin to fix social media, would you say?</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s the most important thing to understand.</p>
<p>In the social sciences, we say,</p>
<p>is social media harmful to kids?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a broad question.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t answer that directly.</p>
<p>You have to have much more specific questions.</p>
<p>You have to operationalize it</p>
<p>and have a theory of how it&rsquo;s harming kids.</p>
<p>And so almost all of the research</p>
<p>is done on what&rsquo;s called the dose response model.</p>
<p>That is, everybody, including most of the researchers,</p>
<p>are thinking about this like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s treat this like sugar.</p>
<p>You know, because the data usually shows</p>
<p>a little bit of social media use</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t correlated with harm, but a lot is.</p>
<p>So, you know, think of it like sugar.</p>
<p>And if kids have a lot of sugar, then it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>So how much is okay?</p>
<p>But social media is not like sugar at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a dose response thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete rewiring of childhood.</p>
<p>So we evolved as a species in which kids play</p>
<p>in mixed age groups.</p>
<p>They learn the skills of adulthood.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always playing and working</p>
<p>and learning and doing errands.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s normal childhood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you develop your brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you become a mature adult until the 1990s.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, we dropped all that.</p>
<p>We said, it&rsquo;s too dangerous.</p>
<p>If we let you outside, you&rsquo;ll be kidnapped.</p>
<p>So we completely, we began rewiring childhood</p>
<p>in the 90s before social media.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big part of the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Lenore Skenazy</p>
<p>who wrote the book, Free Range Kids.</p>
<p>If there are any parents listening to this,</p>
<p>please buy Lenore&rsquo;s book, Free Range Kids,</p>
<p>and then go to letgrow.org.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nonprofit that Lenore and I started</p>
<p>with Peter Gray and Daniel Shookman</p>
<p>to help change the laws and the norms</p>
<p>around letting kids out to play.</p>
<p>They need free play.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the big picture.</p>
<p>They need free play.</p>
<p>And we started stopping that in the 90s</p>
<p>that we reduced it.</p>
<p>And then Gen Z, kids born in 1996,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first people in history</p>
<p>to get on social media before puberty.</p>
<p>Millennials didn&rsquo;t get it until they were in college.</p>
<p>But Gen Z, they get it</p>
<p>because you can lie.</p>
<p>You just lie about your age.</p>
<p>So they really began to get on around 2009, 2010,</p>
<p>and boom, two years later, they&rsquo;re depressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they ate too much sugar necessarily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because even normal social interactions</p>
<p>that kids had in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>largely, well, they decline</p>
<p>because now everything&rsquo;s through the phone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to get across,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just a dose response thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imagine one middle school</p>
<p>where everyone has an Instagram account</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s constant drama.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s constantly checking and posting and worrying.</p>
<p>And imagine going through puberty that way</p>
<p>versus imagine there was a policy,</p>
<p>no phones in school.</p>
<p>You have to check them in a locker.</p>
<p>No one can have an Instagram account.</p>
<p>All the parents are on board.</p>
<p>Parents only let their kids have Instagram</p>
<p>because the kid says everyone else has it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re stuck in a social dilemma.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stuck in a trap.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution?</p>
<p>Keep kids off until they&rsquo;re done with puberty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new study actually by Amy Urban</p>
<p>and Andy Shabilsky showing that the damage is greatest</p>
<p>for girls between 11 and 13.</p>
<p>So there is no way to make it safe for preteens</p>
<p>or even 13, 14 year olds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotta, kids should simply not be allowed</p>
<p>on these business models where you&rsquo;re the product.</p>
<p>They should not be allowed until you&rsquo;re 16.</p>
<p>We need to raise the age and enforce it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest thing.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful solution,</p>
<p>but it makes me wonder if there&rsquo;s other solutions</p>
<p>like controlling the virality of bullying.</p>
<p>Sort of if there&rsquo;s a way that&rsquo;s more productive</p>
<p>to childhood to use social media.</p>
<p>So of course one thing is putting your phone down,</p>
<p>but first of all, from the perspective</p>
<p>of social media companies, it might be difficult</p>
<p>to convince them to do so.</p>
<p>And also for me as an adult who grew up</p>
<p>without social media, social media is a source of joy.</p>
<p>So I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to design the mechanisms</p>
<p>both challenge the ad-driven model,</p>
<p>but actually just technically the recommender system</p>
<p>and how virality works on these platforms.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s possible to design a platform</p>
<p>that leads to growth and to fragility,</p>
<p>but does not lead to depression, self-harm and suicide.</p>
<p>Finding that balance and making that</p>
<p>as the objective function, not engagement or something else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that can be done for kids.</p>
<p>So I am very reluctant to tell adults what to do.</p>
<p>I have a lot of libertarian friends</p>
<p>and I would lose their friendship</p>
<p>if I started saying, oh, it&rsquo;s bad for adults</p>
<p>and we should stop adults from using it.</p>
<p>But by the same token, I&rsquo;m very reluctant</p>
<p>to have Facebook and Instagram tell my kids what to do</p>
<p>without me even knowing</p>
<p>or without me having any ability to control it.</p>
<p>As a parent, it&rsquo;s very hard to stop your kid.</p>
<p>I have stopped my kids from getting on Instagram</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s caused some difficulties,</p>
<p>but they also have thanked me</p>
<p>because they see that it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>They see that what the kids are really on it,</p>
<p>what they post, they see that the culture of it</p>
<p>is stupid as they say.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a way to make it healthy for kids.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s one thing which is healthy for kids,</p>
<p>which is free play.</p>
<p>We already robbed them of most of it in the 90s.</p>
<p>The more time they spend on their devices,</p>
<p>the less they have free play.</p>
<p>Video games is a kind of play.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that these things are all bad,</p>
<p>but 12 hours of video game play</p>
<p>means you don&rsquo;t get any physical play.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>And ultimately, physical play is the way</p>
<p>to develop physical antifragility.</p>
<p>And especially social skills.</p>
<p>Kids need huge amounts of conflict</p>
<p>with no adult to supervise or mediate</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we robbed them of.</p>
<p>So anyway, we should move on</p>
<p>because I get really into the evidence here</p>
<p>because I think the story is actually quite clear now.</p>
<p>There was a lot of ambiguity.</p>
<p>There are conflicting studies,</p>
<p>but when you look at it all together,</p>
<p>the correlational studies are pretty clear</p>
<p>and the effect sizes are coming in around 0.1 to 0.15,</p>
<p>whether you call that a correlation coefficient or a beta.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all standardized beta.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all in that sort of range.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also experimental evidence.</p>
<p>We collect true experiments with random assignment</p>
<p>and they mostly show an effect.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s eyewitness testimony.</p>
<p>You know, the kids themselves,</p>
<p>you talk to girls and you poll them.</p>
<p>Do you think overall Instagram is good</p>
<p>for your mental health or bad for it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna find a group saying,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, Mark, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly good.</p>
<p>No, the girls themselves say this is the major reason.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got studies in the Google Doc</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;ve been surveys.</p>
<p>What do you think is causing depression and anxiety?</p>
<p>And the number one thing they say is social media.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s multiple strands of evidence.</p>
<p>Do you think the recommendation is as a parent</p>
<p>that teens should not use Instagram, Twitter?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ultimately, maybe in the long term,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a more nuanced solution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to make it safe there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unsafe at any speed.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be very difficult to make it safe.</p>
<p>And then the short term,</p>
<p>while we don&rsquo;t know how to make it safe, put down the phone.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Play with other kids via a platform like Roblox</p>
<p>or multiplayer video games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I have no beef with that.</p>
<p>You focus on bullying before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of five or seven different avenues of harm.</p>
<p>The main one I think, which does in the girls,</p>
<p>is not being bullied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s living a life where you&rsquo;re thinking all the time</p>
<p>about posting.</p>
<p>Because once a girl starts posting,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s bad enough that they&rsquo;re scrolling through,</p>
<p>and this is, everyone comments on this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re scrolling through</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s life looks better than yours</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>And all that you see are the ones the algorithm picked</p>
<p>that were the night, anyway.</p>
<p>So the scrolling, I think, is bad for the girls.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove this, but what I&rsquo;m beginning to see</p>
<p>from talking to girls, from seeing how it&rsquo;s used,</p>
<p>is once you start posting, that takes over your mind.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re, basically, you&rsquo;re no longer present.</p>
<p>Because even if you&rsquo;re only spending five or six hours a day</p>
<p>on Instagram, you&rsquo;re always thinking about it.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in class,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about how are people responding</p>
<p>to the post that I made between classes.</p>
<p>I mean, I do it.</p>
<p>I try to stay off Twitter for a while,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;ve got this big article, I&rsquo;m tweeting about it.</p>
<p>Like, I check 20 times a day, I&rsquo;ll check.</p>
<p>Like, what are people saying?</p>
<p>What are people saying?</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a 58-year-old man.</p>
<p>Imagine being a 12-year-old girl going through puberty.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re self-conscious about how you look.</p>
<p>And I see some young women,</p>
<p>I see some professional young women,</p>
<p>women in their 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>who are putting up sexy photos of themselves.</p>
<p>Like, and this is so sad, so sad.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be doing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, the thing where I disagree a little bit</p>
<p>is I agree with you in the short term,</p>
<p>but in the long term,</p>
<p>I feel it&rsquo;s the responsibility of social media,</p>
<p>not in some kind of ethical way,</p>
<p>not just in an ethical way,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll actually be good for the product</p>
<p>and for the company to maximize the long-term happiness</p>
<p>and well-being of the person.</p>
<p>So not just engagement.</p>
<p>So consider all.</p>
<p>But the person is not the customer.</p>
<p>So the thing is not to make them happy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to keep them on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it is currently, but that driven.</p>
<p>If we can get a business model, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be all for it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the way to make much more money.</p>
<p>So like a subscription model</p>
<p>where the money comes from paying?</p>
<p>That would work, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>That would help.</p>
<p>So subscription definitely would help,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s so much,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people say it&rsquo;s about the source of money,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>the fundamental mission of the product.</p>
<p>If you want people to really love a thing,</p>
<p>I think that thing should maximize</p>
<p>your long-term well-being.</p>
<p>It should.</p>
<p>In theory, in morality land, it should.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just morality land.</p>
<p>I think in business land, too.</p>
<p>But that may be a discussion for another day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re studying the reality of the way things currently are,</p>
<p>and they are as they are, as the studies are highlighting.</p>
<p>So let us go then from the land of mental health</p>
<p>for young people to the land of democracy.</p>
<p>By the way, in these big umbrella areas,</p>
<p>is there a connection, is there a correlation</p>
<p>between the mental health of a human mind</p>
<p>and the division of our political discourse?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, oh, yes.</p>
<p>So our brains are structured to be really good</p>
<p>at approach and avoid.</p>
<p>So we have circuits, the front left circuit,</p>
<p>this is an oversimplification, but there&rsquo;s some truth to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called the behavioral activation system,</p>
<p>front left cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about approach, opportunity,</p>
<p>you know, kid in a candy store.</p>
<p>And then the front right cortex has circuits</p>
<p>that specialize for withdrawal, fear, threat.</p>
<p>And of course, students, you know, I&rsquo;m a college professor,</p>
<p>and most of us think about our college days like,</p>
<p>you know, yeah, we were anxious at times, but it was fun.</p>
<p>And it was like, I can take all these courses,</p>
<p>I can do all these clubs, I know all these people.</p>
<p>Now imagine if in 2013, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>students are coming in with their front right cortex</p>
<p>hyperactivated, everything&rsquo;s a threat.</p>
<p>Everything is dangerous, there&rsquo;s not enough to go around.</p>
<p>So the front right cortex puts us into</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called defend mode, as opposed to discover mode.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s move up to adults.</p>
<p>Imagine a large, diverse, secular, liberal democracy</p>
<p>in which people are most of the time in discover mode.</p>
<p>And you know, we have a problem,</p>
<p>hmm, let&rsquo;s think how to solve it.</p>
<p>And this is what de Tocqueville said about Americans,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s a problem, we get together,</p>
<p>we figure out how to solve it.</p>
<p>And he said, whereas in England and France,</p>
<p>people would wait for the king to do it.</p>
<p>But here, like, let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the can-do mindset.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s front left cortex discover mode.</p>
<p>If you have a national shift of people</p>
<p>spending more time in defend mode,</p>
<p>now you, so everything that comes up,</p>
<p>whatever anyone says, you&rsquo;re not looking like,</p>
<p>oh, is there something good about it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking, you know, how is this dangerous?</p>
<p>How is this a threat?</p>
<p>How is this violence?</p>
<p>How can I attack this?</p>
<p>How can I, you know, so if you imagine, you know,</p>
<p>God up there with a little lever, like,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s push everyone over into, you know,</p>
<p>more into discover mode.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like joy breaks out, age of Aquarius.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s shift them back into,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put everyone in defend mode.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t think of a better way</p>
<p>to put people in defend mode</p>
<p>than to have them spend some time</p>
<p>on partisan or political Twitter,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just a stream of horror stories,</p>
<p>including videos about how horrible the other side is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re bad people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that if they win this election,</p>
<p>then we lose our country, or then it&rsquo;s catastrophe.</p>
<p>So Twitter, and again, we&rsquo;re not saying all of Twitter,</p>
<p>you know, most people aren&rsquo;t on Twitter</p>
<p>and people that are are mostly not talking about politics,</p>
<p>but the ones that are on talking about politics</p>
<p>are flooding us with stuff.</p>
<p>All the journalists see it.</p>
<p>All the major mainstream media</p>
<p>is hugely influenced by Twitter.</p>
<p>So if we put everyone,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s more sort of anxiety, sense of threat,</p>
<p>this colors everything.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not, you know,</p>
<p>the great thing about a democracy,</p>
<p>and especially, you know,</p>
<p>or a legislature that has some diversity in it,</p>
<p>is that the art of politics is</p>
<p>that you can grow the pie and then divide it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just fight zero sum.</p>
<p>You find ways that we can all get 60% of what we want.</p>
<p>And that ends when everyone&rsquo;s anxious and angry.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to start to figure out who&rsquo;s to blame here.</p>
<p>Is it the nature of social media?</p>
<p>Is it the decision of the people</p>
<p>at the heads of social media companies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>and the detailed engineering designs of the algorithm?</p>
<p>Is it the users of social media</p>
<p>that drive narratives like, you mentioned journalists,</p>
<p>that want to maximize drama</p>
<p>in order to drive clicks to their off-site articles?</p>
<p>Is it just human nature that loves drama,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t look away from an accident when you&rsquo;re driving by it?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about,</p>
<p>the reason I ask these questions is to see,</p>
<p>can we start to figure out what the solution would be</p>
<p>to alleviate, to deescalate the-</p>
<p>Not yet, not yet.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first, we have to understand,</p>
<p>as we did on the teen mental health thing,</p>
<p>okay, now let&rsquo;s lay out what is the problem?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s messing up our country?</p>
<p>And then we can talk about solutions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all the things you said</p>
<p>interacting in an interesting way.</p>
<p>So human nature is tribal.</p>
<p>We evolved for intergroup conflict.</p>
<p>We love war.</p>
<p>The first time my buddies and I played paintball,</p>
<p>I was 29.</p>
<p>And we were divided into teams with strangers</p>
<p>to shoot guns at each other and kill each other.</p>
<p>And we all, afterwards, it was like,</p>
<p>oh my God, that was incredible.</p>
<p>Like it really felt like we&rsquo;d opened a room in our hearts</p>
<p>that had never been opened.</p>
<p>But as men, testosterone changes our brains and our bodies</p>
<p>and activates the war stuff, like we&rsquo;ve got more stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why boys like certain team sports, it&rsquo;s play war.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s who we are.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re always tribal.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re always wanting to fight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also really good at making peace and cooperation</p>
<p>and finding deals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good at trade and exchange.</p>
<p>So you want your country to,</p>
<p>you want a society that has room for conflict,</p>
<p>ideally over sports, like that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally, it&rsquo;s not just harmless, it&rsquo;s actually good.</p>
<p>But otherwise you want cooperation</p>
<p>to generally prevail in the society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you create prosperity and peace.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re gonna have a diverse democracy,</p>
<p>you really better focus on cooperation,</p>
<p>not on tribalism and division.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful book by Yasha Monk</p>
<p>called The Great Experiment</p>
<p>that talks about the difficulty of diversity and democracy</p>
<p>and what we need to do to get this right</p>
<p>and to get the benefits of diversity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that the technological environment</p>
<p>makes it really easy for us to cooperate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give everyone telephones and the postal service.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give them email, like, wow,</p>
<p>we can do all these things together with people far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Now, instead of that, let&rsquo;s give them a technology</p>
<p>that encourages them to fight.</p>
<p>So early Facebook and Twitter were generally lovely places.</p>
<p>People old enough to remember, they were fun.</p>
<p>There was a lot of humor.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel like you were gonna get your head blown off</p>
<p>no matter what you said.</p>
<p>2007, 2008, 2009, it was still fun.</p>
<p>These were nice places mostly.</p>
<p>And almost all the platforms start off as nice places.</p>
<p>But, and this is the key thing in the article,</p>
<p>in the Atlantic article on Babel, on after Babel.</p>
<p>The Atlantic article, by the way,</p>
<p>is why the past 10 years of American life</p>
<p>have been uniquely stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah, my title in the magazine was after Babel,</p>
<p>adapting to a world we can no longer share,</p>
<p>is what I proposed.</p>
<p>But they A, B tested, what&rsquo;s the title</p>
<p>that gets the most clicks?</p>
<p>And it was why the past 10 years have been unique.</p>
<p>So Babel, the Tower of Babel is a driving metaphor</p>
<p>in the piece.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is it, what&rsquo;s the Tower of Babel?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Babel?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Okay, so the Tower of Babel is a story early in Genesis</p>
<p>where the descendants of Noah are spreading out</p>
<p>and repopulating the world.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re on the plain of Shinar.</p>
<p>And they say, let us build us a city with a tower</p>
<p>to make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered again.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very short story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot in it, but it looks like they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>you know, we don&rsquo;t want God to flood us again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build a city and a tower and to reach the heavens.</p>
<p>And God is offended by the hubris of these people</p>
<p>acting again like gods.</p>
<p>And he says, here&rsquo;s the key line.</p>
<p>He says, let us go down and confuse their language</p>
<p>so that they may not understand one another.</p>
<p>So in the story, he doesn&rsquo;t literally knock the tower over,</p>
<p>but, you know, many of us have seen images</p>
<p>or, you know, movie dramatizations</p>
<p>where a great wind comes and the tower is knocked over</p>
<p>and the people are left wandering amid the rubble,</p>
<p>unable to talk to each other.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been grappling, I&rsquo;ve been trying to say,</p>
<p>what the hell happened to our society?</p>
<p>You know, beginning in 2014,</p>
<p>what the hell is happening to universities?</p>
<p>And then it spread out from universities,</p>
<p>it hit journalism, the arts,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s all over companies.</p>
<p>What the hell happened to us?</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until I reread the Babel story</p>
<p>a couple of years ago that I thought,</p>
<p>whoa, this is it, this is the metaphor.</p>
<p>Because, you know, I&rsquo;d been thinking about tribalism</p>
<p>and left-right battles and war,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s easy to think about.</p>
<p>But Babel isn&rsquo;t like, you know,</p>
<p>and God said, let half of the people hate the other half.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s God said, let us confuse their language</p>
<p>that they, none of them can understand each other ever again</p>
<p>for at least for a while.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a story about fragmentation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s unique about our time.</p>
<p>So Meta or Facebook wrote a rebuttal to my article.</p>
<p>They disputed what I said,</p>
<p>and one of their arguments was,</p>
<p>oh, but, you know, polarization goes back</p>
<p>way before social media,</p>
<p>and, you know, it was happening in the 90s.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right, it does.</p>
<p>And I did say that,</p>
<p>but I should have said it more clearly with more examples.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the new thing.</p>
<p>Even though left and right</p>
<p>were beginning to hate each other more,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t afraid of the person next to us.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t afraid of each other.</p>
<p>Cable TV, you know, Fox News,</p>
<p>whatever you want to point to about increasing polarization,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t make me afraid of my students.</p>
<p>And that was new in around 2014, 2015.</p>
<p>We started hearing, getting articles,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a liberal professor</p>
<p>and my liberal students frightened me.</p>
<p>It was in Vox in 2015.</p>
<p>And that was after Greg and I had turned in</p>
<p>the draft of our first draft of our coddling article.</p>
<p>And surveys show over and over again,</p>
<p>students are not as afraid of their professors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually afraid of other students.</p>
<p>Most students are lovely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the whole generation has lost their minds.</p>
<p>What happens is a small number,</p>
<p>a small number are adept at using social media</p>
<p>to destroy anyone that they think</p>
<p>they can get credit for destroying.</p>
<p>And the bizarre thing is it&rsquo;s never,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rarely about what ideas you express.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually about a word, like he used this word,</p>
<p>or this was insensitive,</p>
<p>or I can link this word to that word.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, they don&rsquo;t even engage with ideas and arguments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real sort of gotcha, prosecute,</p>
<p>almost more like a, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a witch trial mindset.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>So the unique thing here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about social media in those years</p>
<p>that a small number of people</p>
<p>can sort of be catalysts for this division.</p>
<p>They can start the viral wave</p>
<p>that leads to a division that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than the kind of division we saw before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little different than a viral wave.</p>
<p>Once you get some people</p>
<p>who can use social media to intimidate,</p>
<p>you get a sudden phase shift.</p>
<p>You get a big change in the dynamics of groups.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the heart of the article.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just another article</p>
<p>about how social media is polarizing us</p>
<p>and destroying democracy.</p>
<p>The heart of the article is an analysis</p>
<p>of what makes groups smart and what makes them stupid.</p>
<p>And so because, as we said earlier, you know,</p>
<p>my own research is on post-hoc reasoning,</p>
<p>just post-hoc justification, rationalization.</p>
<p>The only cure for that is other people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t share your biases.</p>
<p>And so if you have an academic debate,</p>
<p>as like the one I&rsquo;m having with, you know,</p>
<p>with these other researchers over social media,</p>
<p>you know, I write something, they write something,</p>
<p>I have to take account of their arguments</p>
<p>and they have to take account of mine.</p>
<p>When the academic world works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because it puts us together</p>
<p>in ways that things cancel out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes universities smart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes them generators of knowledge.</p>
<p>Unless we stop dissent,</p>
<p>what if we say on these topics, there can be no dissent.</p>
<p>And if anyone says otherwise,</p>
<p>if any academic comes up with research that says otherwise,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to destroy them.</p>
<p>And if any academic even tweets a study</p>
<p>contradicting what is the official word,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to destroy them.</p>
<p>And that was the famous case of David Shore,</p>
<p>who in the days after George Floyd was killed</p>
<p>and there were protests,</p>
<p>and the question is, are these protests</p>
<p>going to be productive?</p>
<p>Are they going to backfire?</p>
<p>Now, most of them were peaceful, but some were violent.</p>
<p>And he tweeted a study.</p>
<p>He just simply tweeted a study</p>
<p>done by an African-American,</p>
<p>I think sociologist at Princeton, Omar Wasow.</p>
<p>And Wasow&rsquo;s study showed</p>
<p>that when you look back at the 60s,</p>
<p>you see that where there were violent protests,</p>
<p>it tended to backfire.</p>
<p>Peaceful protests tend to work.</p>
<p>And so he simply tweeted that study.</p>
<p>And there was a Twitter mob after him.</p>
<p>This was insensitive.</p>
<p>This was anti-black, I think he was accused of.</p>
<p>And he was fired within a day or two.</p>
<p>So this is the kind of dynamic.</p>
<p>This is not caused by cable TV.</p>
<p>This is not caused.</p>
<p>This is something new.</p>
<p>Can I, just on a small tangent there,</p>
<p>in that situation, because it happens time and time again,</p>
<p>you highlight in your current work,</p>
<p>but also in the coddling of the American mind,</p>
<p>is the blame on the mob,</p>
<p>the mechanisms that enables the mob,</p>
<p>or the people that do the firing?</p>
<p>The administration does the firing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of them.</p>
<p>I sometimes feel that we don&rsquo;t put enough blame</p>
<p>on the people that do the firing.</p>
<p>Which is, that feels like,</p>
<p>in the long arc of human history,</p>
<p>that is the place for courage and for ideals, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it stops.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the book stops.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be new mechanisms for mobs</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be tribalism.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it means to be a leader,</p>
<p>is to stop the mob at the door.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a social psychologist,</p>
<p>which means I look at the social forces that work on people.</p>
<p>And if you show me a situation</p>
<p>in which 95% of the people behave one way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a way that we find surprising and shameful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say,</p>
<p>wow, 95% of the people are shameful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say, wow, what a powerful situation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to change that situation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I think is happening here,</p>
<p>because there are hardly any, in the first few years,</p>
<p>it begins around 2018, 2019,</p>
<p>it really enters the corporate world.</p>
<p>There are hardly any leaders who stood up against it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot, and it&rsquo;s always the same thing.</p>
<p>You have these people in their,</p>
<p>usually in their 50s or 60s.</p>
<p>Generally, they&rsquo;re progressive or on the left.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re accused of things by their young employees.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the vocabulary to stand up to it.</p>
<p>And they give in very quickly.</p>
<p>And because it happens over and over again,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only a few examples of university presidents</p>
<p>who said like, no, we&rsquo;re not going to stop this talk</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re freaking out.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not going to fire this professor</p>
<p>because he wrote a paper that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>There are so few examples,</p>
<p>I have to include that the situational forces are so strong.</p>
<p>Now, I think we are seeing,</p>
<p>we are seeing a reversal in the last few weeks or months.</p>
<p>A clear sign of that is that the New York Times</p>
<p>actually came out with an editorial</p>
<p>from the editorial board</p>
<p>saying that free speech is important.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s amazing that the Times had the guts</p>
<p>to stand up for free speech,</p>
<p>because the people, well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been happening with the Times</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve allowed Twitter</p>
<p>to become the editorial board.</p>
<p>Twitter has control over the New York Times,</p>
<p>and the New York Times literally will change papers.</p>
<p>I have an essay in Politico with Nadine Strossen,</p>
<p>Steve Pinker, and Pamela Peresky</p>
<p>on how the New York Times</p>
<p>retracted and changed an editorial by Bret Stephens.</p>
<p>And they did it in a sneaky way,</p>
<p>and they lied about it.</p>
<p>And they did this out of fear,</p>
<p>because he mentioned IQ.</p>
<p>He mentioned IQ and Jews.</p>
<p>And then he went on to say,</p>
<p>it probably isn&rsquo;t a genetic thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably cultural, he mentioned it.</p>
<p>And the New York Times,</p>
<p>I mean, they were really cowardly.</p>
<p>Now, I think they, from what I hear,</p>
<p>they know that they were cowardly.</p>
<p>They know that they should not have fired James Bennett.</p>
<p>They know that they gave in to the mob.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re now poking their head up</p>
<p>above the parapet, and they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>oh, we think that free speech is important.</p>
<p>And then, of course, they got their heads blown off,</p>
<p>because Twitter reacted like, how dare you say this?</p>
<p>Are you saying racist speech is okay?</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t back down.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t retract it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t apologize for defending free speech.</p>
<p>So I think the Times might be coming back.</p>
<p>Can I ask you an opinion on something here?</p>
<p>What, in terms of the Times coming back,</p>
<p>in terms of Twitter being the editorial board</p>
<p>for the prestigious journalistic organizations,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the importance of the role</p>
<p>of Mr. Elon Musk in this?</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s all fun and games,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s a human who tweets about the importance</p>
<p>of freedom of speech and buys Twitter.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the influence,</p>
<p>the positive and the negative possible consequences</p>
<p>of this particular action?</p>
<p>So, you know, if he is gonna succeed,</p>
<p>and if he&rsquo;s gonna be one of the major reasons</p>
<p>why we decarbonize quickly and why we get to Mars,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m willing to cut him a lot of slack.</p>
<p>So I have an overall positive view of him.</p>
<p>Now, where I&rsquo;m concerned and where I&rsquo;m critical</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re in the middle of a raging culture war,</p>
<p>and this culture war is making our institutions stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making them fail.</p>
<p>This culture war, I think, could destroy our country,</p>
<p>and by destroy, I mean we could descend</p>
<p>into constant constitutional crises, a lot more violence.</p>
<p>You know, not that we&rsquo;re gonna disappear,</p>
<p>not that we&rsquo;re gonna kill each other,</p>
<p>but I think there will be a lot more violence.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the middle of this raging culture war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possibly turning to violence.</p>
<p>You need to not add fuel to the fire,</p>
<p>and the fact that he declared</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s gonna be a Republican</p>
<p>and the Democrats are the bad party,</p>
<p>and, you know, as an individual citizen,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s entitled to his opinion, of course,</p>
<p>but as an influential citizen,</p>
<p>he should at least be thoughtful,</p>
<p>and more importantly,</p>
<p>companies need, and I think would benefit</p>
<p>from a Geneva Convention for the culture war in which,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all being damaged</p>
<p>by the culture war coming to the companies.</p>
<p>What we need to get to, I hope,</p>
<p>is a place where companies do,</p>
<p>they have strong ethical obligations</p>
<p>about the effects that they cause,</p>
<p>about how they treat their employees,</p>
<p>about their supply chain.</p>
<p>They have strong ethical obligations,</p>
<p>but they should not be weighing in on culture war issues.</p>
<p>Well, if I can read the exact tweet,</p>
<p>because part of the tweet I like,</p>
<p>he said, in the past, I voted Democrat</p>
<p>because they were mostly the kindness party,</p>
<p>but they have become the party of division and hate,</p>
<p>so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.</p>
<p>And then he finishes with,</p>
<p>now watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>What do you think he was thinking</p>
<p>that he came out so blatantly as a partisan?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s probably communicating with the board,</p>
<p>with the people inside Twitter,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s clearly seeing the lean,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s responding to that lean.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also opening the door to the potential</p>
<p>bringing back the former president onto the platform,</p>
<p>and also bringing back,</p>
<p>which he&rsquo;s probably looking at the numbers</p>
<p>of the people who are behind Truth Social,</p>
<p>saying that, okay,</p>
<p>it seems that there&rsquo;s a strong lean in Twitter</p>
<p>in terms of the left.</p>
<p>And in fact, from what I see,</p>
<p>it seems like the current operation of Twitter</p>
<p>is the extremes of the left get outraged by something,</p>
<p>and the extremes of the right</p>
<p>point out how the left is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like, that seems to be the mechanism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the source of the drama,</p>
<p>and then the left gets very mad at the right</p>
<p>that points out the ridiculousness,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this vicious kind of cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the polarization cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that happened here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shift where,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a decline, I would say,</p>
<p>in both parties towards being shitty.</p>
<p>Look, everything with the parties,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is, should the most important CEO in America,</p>
<p>the CEO of some of our biggest and most important companies,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s imagine five years from now,</p>
<p>two different worlds.</p>
<p>In one world, the CEO of every Fortune 500 company has said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Republican because I hate those douchebags,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m a Democrat because I hate those Nazi racists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one world where everybody declares,</p>
<p>everybody puts up a thing in their window,</p>
<p>everybody, it&rsquo;s culture war everywhere, all the time,</p>
<p>24 hours a day.</p>
<p>You pick a doctor based on whether he&rsquo;s red or blue.</p>
<p>Everything is culture war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one possible future, which we&rsquo;re headed towards.</p>
<p>The other is, we say, you know what?</p>
<p>Political conflict should be confined to political spaces.</p>
<p>There is a room for protest,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t go protesting at people&rsquo;s private homes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go threatening their children.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go doxing them.</p>
<p>We have to have channels</p>
<p>that are not culture war all the time.</p>
<p>When you go shopping, when you go to a restaurant,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be yelled at and screamed at.</p>
<p>When you buy a product, you should be able to buy products</p>
<p>from an excellent company.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have to always think, what&rsquo;s the CEO?</p>
<p>I mean, what an insane world, but that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re heading.</p>
<p>So I think that Elon did a really bad thing</p>
<p>in launching that tweet.</p>
<p>That was, I think, really throwing fuel on a fire</p>
<p>and setting a norm in which businesses</p>
<p>are gonna get even more politicized than they are.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying, specifically,</p>
<p>the problem was that he picked a side.</p>
<p>As the head of, yes, as the CEO,</p>
<p>as the head of several major companies,</p>
<p>of course, we can find out what his views are.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I mean, actually, with him, it&rsquo;s maybe hard to know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that a CEO can&rsquo;t be a partisan or have views,</p>
<p>but to publicly declare it in that way,</p>
<p>really insulting way, this is throwing fuel on the fire</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s setting a precedent that corporations</p>
<p>are major players in the culture war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to reverse that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotta pull back from that.</p>
<p>Let me play devil&rsquo;s advocate here.</p>
<p>So, because I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to interact with quite a few CEOs,</p>
<p>there is also a value for authenticity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing this was written while sitting</p>
<p>on the toilet and I could see in a day from now</p>
<p>saying, LOL, just kidding, there&rsquo;s a humor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lightness, there&rsquo;s a chaos element.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, chaos is not-</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not what we need right now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need more chaos.</p>
<p>Well, so, yes, there&rsquo;s a balance here.</p>
<p>The chaos isn&rsquo;t engineered chaos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really authentically who he is.</p>
<p>And I would like to say that there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trade-off because if you become a politician,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a trade-off between, in this case,</p>
<p>maybe authenticity and civility, maybe,</p>
<p>like being calculating about the impact you have</p>
<p>with your words versus just being yourself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure calculating is also a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Both are slippery slopes.</p>
<p>You have to be careful.</p>
<p>So when we have conversations in a vacuum</p>
<p>and we just say like, what should a person do?</p>
<p>Those are very hard.</p>
<p>But our world is actually structured</p>
<p>into domains and institutions.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s just like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>talking here among our friends,</p>
<p>like we should be authentic, sure.</p>
<p>But the CEO of a company has fiduciary duties,</p>
<p>legal fiduciary duties to the company.</p>
<p>He owes loyalty to the company.</p>
<p>And if he is using the company for his own political gain</p>
<p>or other purposes or social standing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a violation of his fiduciary duty to the company.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s debate among scholars</p>
<p>whether your fiduciary duties to the shareholders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the shareholders.</p>
<p>I think many legal experts say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s a legal person.</p>
<p>You have duties to the company.</p>
<p>Employees owe a duty to the company.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got those duties.</p>
<p>And I think he, you can say he&rsquo;s being authentic,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also violating those duties.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily he&rsquo;s violating a law by doing it,</p>
<p>but he certainly is shredding any notion</p>
<p>of professional ethics around leadership</p>
<p>of a company in the modern age.</p>
<p>I think you have to take it in the full context</p>
<p>because you see that he&rsquo;s not being a political player.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just saying, quit being douchey.</p>
<p>Suppose the CEO of Ford says, you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pick a group.</p>
<p>Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t do a racial group</p>
<p>because that would be different.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say, you know what?</p>
<p>Left-handed people are douchebags.</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>Like, why would you say that?</p>
<p>Like, why would you drag away left-handed people?</p>
<p>What you said now is not either funny or lighthearted</p>
<p>because I hate them.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not picking on you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that statement.</p>
<p>Words matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lightness to the statement in the full context.</p>
<p>If you look at the timeline of the man,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ridiculous memes and there&rsquo;s nonstop jokes</p>
<p>that my big problem with the CEO of Ford</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s never any of that.</p>
<p>Not only is there any of that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a celebration of the beauty of the engineering</p>
<p>of the different products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all political speak channeled</p>
<p>through multiple meetings of PR.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s levels upon levels upon levels</p>
<p>where you think that it&rsquo;s really not authentic.</p>
<p>And there, you&rsquo;re actually, by being polite,</p>
<p>by being civil, you&rsquo;re actually playing politics</p>
<p>because all of your actual political decision-making</p>
<p>is done in the back channels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>Here, here&rsquo;s a human being authentic</p>
<p>and actually struggling with some of the ideas</p>
<p>and having fun with it.</p>
<p>I think this lightness represents the kind of positivity</p>
<p>that we should be striving for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to say that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at these statements</p>
<p>and they seem negative,</p>
<p>but in the full context of social media,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they are.</p>
<p>But look at what you just said, in the full context.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking his tweets in context.</p>
<p>You know who doesn&rsquo;t do that?</p>
<p>Twitter.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the Twitter.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the fundamental problem you highlight.</p>
<p>The rule of Twitter is there is no context.</p>
<p>Everything is taken in the maximum possible way.</p>
<p>There is no context.</p>
<p>So this is not like,</p>
<p>yes, I wish we did take people in context.</p>
<p>I wish we lived in that world.</p>
<p>But now that we have Twitter and Facebook,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t live in that world anymore.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it is a bit of responsibility</p>
<p>for people with a large platform</p>
<p>to consider the fact that</p>
<p>there is the fundamental mechanism of Twitter</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t wanna hang it on large platform</p>
<p>because then that&rsquo;s what a lot of people say.</p>
<p>Like, well, you know, she shouldn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>because she has a large platform</p>
<p>and she should say things that agree with my politics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hang it on large platform.</p>
<p>I wanna hang it on CEO of a company.</p>
<p>CEOs of a company have duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>And, you know, Scott Galloway,</p>
<p>I think is very clear about this.</p>
<p>You know, he criticized Elon a lot</p>
<p>as being a really bad role model for young men.</p>
<p>Young men need role models</p>
<p>and he is a very appealing, attractive role model.</p>
<p>So I agree with you,</p>
<p>but in terms of being a role model,</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t wanna put a responsibility on people,</p>
<p>but yes, he could be a much, much better role model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t insult sitting senators by calling them old.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I won&rsquo;t do a both-side-ism of like,</p>
<p>well, those senators can be assholes too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s fair enough.</p>
<p>Respond intelligently, as I tweeted,</p>
<p>to unintelligent treatment, yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the reason I like, and he&rsquo;s now a friend,</p>
<p>the reason I like Elon is because of the engineering,</p>
<p>because of the work he does.</p>
<p>No, I admire him enormously for that.</p>
<p>But what I admire on the Twitter side is the authenticity</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been a little bit jaded and worn out</p>
<p>by people who have built up walls,</p>
<p>people in the position of power,</p>
<p>the CEOs and the politicians who built up walls</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t see the real person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I love long-form podcasting,</p>
<p>especially if you talk more than 10 minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to have a wall up.</p>
<p>It all kind of crumbles away.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, but yes, yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That is a step backwards to say,</p>
<p>at least to me, the biggest problem is the pick sides</p>
<p>to say, I&rsquo;m not going to vote this way or that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, like leave that to the politicians.</p>
<p>You have much, like the importance of social media</p>
<p>is far bigger than the bickering,</p>
<p>the short-term bickering of any one political party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform where we make progress,</p>
<p>where we develop ideas through sort of rigorous discourse,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So, okay, so here&rsquo;s an idea about social media</p>
<p>developed through social media from Elon,</p>
<p>which is, you know, everyone freaks out</p>
<p>because they think either, you know,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s going to do less content moderations.</p>
<p>The left is freaking out</p>
<p>because they want more content moderation.</p>
<p>The right is celebrating</p>
<p>because they think the people</p>
<p>doing the content moderation are on the left.</p>
<p>But there was a one, I think it was a tweet,</p>
<p>where he said like three things</p>
<p>that he was going to do to make it better</p>
<p>and was, you know, defeat the bots or something.</p>
<p>But he said, authenticate all humans.</p>
<p>And this is a hugely important statement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty powerful</p>
<p>that this guy can put three words in a tweet.</p>
<p>And actually, I think this could change the world.</p>
<p>Even if the bid fails, the fact that Elon said that,</p>
<p>that he thinks we need to authenticate all humans is huge.</p>
<p>Because now, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about solutions here.</p>
<p>What can we do to make social media</p>
<p>a better place for democracy,</p>
<p>a place that actually makes democracy better?</p>
<p>As Tristan Harris has pointed out,</p>
<p>social media and digital technology,</p>
<p>the Chinese are using it really skillfully</p>
<p>to make a better authoritarian nation.</p>
<p>And by better, I don&rsquo;t mean morally better.</p>
<p>I mean like more stable, successful.</p>
<p>Whereas we&rsquo;re using it to make ourselves weaker,</p>
<p>more fragmented, and more insane.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re on the way down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in big trouble.</p>
<p>And all the argument is about content moderation.</p>
<p>And what we learned from Francis Haugen</p>
<p>is that what, five or 10% of what they might call</p>
<p>hate speech gets caught, 1% of violence and intimidation.</p>
<p>Content moderation, even if we do a lot more of it,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna make a big difference.</p>
<p>All the powers and the dynamics changes to the architecture.</p>
<p>And as I said in my Atlantic article,</p>
<p>what are the reforms that would matter for social media?</p>
<p>And the number one thing I said,</p>
<p>the number one thing I believe is user authentication</p>
<p>or user verification.</p>
<p>And people freak out and they say like,</p>
<p>oh, but we need anonymous.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, fine, you can be anonymous.</p>
<p>But what I think needs to be done is</p>
<p>anyone can open an account on Twitter, Facebook, whatever,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re over 16, and that&rsquo;s another piece.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re 16 or 18, at a certain age,</p>
<p>you can be treated like an adult.</p>
<p>You can open an account and you can look, you can read,</p>
<p>and you can make up whatever fake name you want.</p>
<p>But if you want to post,</p>
<p>if you want the viral amplification on a company</p>
<p>that has section 230 protection from lawsuits,</p>
<p>which is a very special privilege,</p>
<p>I understand the need for it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful privilege</p>
<p>to protect them from lawsuits.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to post on platforms</p>
<p>that as we&rsquo;ll get to in the Google Doc,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that they are undermining</p>
<p>and damaging democracy.</p>
<p>Then the company has this minimal responsibility</p>
<p>it has to meet.</p>
<p>Banks have know your customer laws.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just walk up to a bank with a bag of money</p>
<p>that you stole and say, here, deposit this for me.</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s John Smith.</p>
<p>You have to actually show who you are.</p>
<p>And the bank isn&rsquo;t gonna announce who you are publicly,</p>
<p>but you have to, if they&rsquo;re gonna do business with you,</p>
<p>they need to know you&rsquo;re a real person, not a criminal.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of schemes for how to do this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple levels.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t seem to understand this.</p>
<p>Level zero of authentication is nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have now.</p>
<p>Level one, this might be what Elon meant.</p>
<p>Authenticate all humans,</p>
<p>meaning you have to at least pass a CAPTCHA</p>
<p>or some test to show you&rsquo;re not a bot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no identity, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a constant cat and mouse struggle between bots.</p>
<p>So we try to just filter out pure bots.</p>
<p>The next level up, there are a variety of schemes</p>
<p>that allow you to authenticate identity</p>
<p>in ways that are not traceable or kept.</p>
<p>So some, whether you show an ID, whether you use biometric,</p>
<p>whether you have something on the blockchain</p>
<p>that establishes identity, whether it&rsquo;s linked to a phone,</p>
<p>whatever it is, there are multiple schemes now</p>
<p>that companies have figured out for how to do this.</p>
<p>And so if you did that, then in order to get an account</p>
<p>where you have posting privileges on Facebook or Twitter</p>
<p>or TikTok or whatever, you have to at least do that.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you know,</p>
<p>now the other people are real humans too.</p>
<p>And suddenly our public square&rsquo;s a lot nicer</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have bots swarming around.</p>
<p>This would also cut down on trolls.</p>
<p>You still have trolls who use their real name,</p>
<p>but this would just make it a little scarier for trolls.</p>
<p>Some men turn into complete assholes.</p>
<p>They can be very polite in real life,</p>
<p>but some men, as soon as they have the anonymity,</p>
<p>they start using racial slurs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re horrible.</p>
<p>One troll can ruin thousands of people&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m somebody who believes in free speech.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussions about this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll ask you some questions about this too.</p>
<p>But there is, the tension there is the power of a troll</p>
<p>to ruin the party.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So like this idea of free speech,</p>
<p>boy, do you have to also consider,</p>
<p>if you want to have a private party and enjoy your time,</p>
<p>challenging, lots of disagreement, debate,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, but fun.</p>
<p>No like annoying person screaming, just not disagreeing,</p>
<p>but just like spilling the drinks all over the place.</p>
<p>Yeah, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So see, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction</p>
<p>to at least verify the humanness of a person</p>
<p>while maintaining anonymity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one step, but the further step,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe doesn&rsquo;t go all the way</p>
<p>because you can still figure out ways</p>
<p>to create multiple accounts and you can-</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a lot harder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to do this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of creativity out there</p>
<p>about solving this problem.</p>
<p>So if you go to the Social Media and Political Dysfunction</p>
<p>Google Doc that I created with Chris Bale,</p>
<p>and then you go to section 11,</p>
<p>Proposals for Improving Social Media.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re collecting there now some of the ideas</p>
<p>for how to do user authentication.</p>
<p>And so one is WorldCoin, there&rsquo;s one human-id.org.</p>
<p>This is a new organization created by an NYU Stern student</p>
<p>who just came into my office last week,</p>
<p>working with some other people.</p>
<p>And what they do here is they have a method</p>
<p>of identity verification that is keyed to your phone.</p>
<p>So you do have to have a phone number.</p>
<p>And of course you can buy seven different phone numbers</p>
<p>if you want, but it&rsquo;s gonna be about $20 or $30 a month.</p>
<p>So nobody&rsquo;s gonna buy a thousand phones.</p>
<p>So yeah, you don&rsquo;t have just one unique ID,</p>
<p>but most people do, and nobody has a thousand.</p>
<p>So just things like this</p>
<p>that would make an enormous difference.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the way that I think about it.</p>
<p>Imagine a public square in which the incentives</p>
<p>are to be an asshole,</p>
<p>that the more you kick people in the shins</p>
<p>and spit on them and throw things at them,</p>
<p>the more people applaud you.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the public square we have now.</p>
<p>Not for most people, but as you said,</p>
<p>just one troll can ruin it for everybody.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a thousand of us in the public square</p>
<p>and 10 are incentivized to kick us and throw shit at us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no fun to be in that public square.</p>
<p>So right now, I think Twitter in particular</p>
<p>is making our public square much worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making our democracy much weaker,</p>
<p>much more divided, it&rsquo;s bringing us down.</p>
<p>Imagine if we changed the incentives.</p>
<p>Imagine if the incentive was to be constructive.</p>
<p>And so this is an idea that I&rsquo;ve been kicking around.</p>
<p>I talked about it with Reid Hoffman last week</p>
<p>and he seemed to think it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>And it would be very easy to,</p>
<p>rather than trying to focus on posts,</p>
<p>what post is fake or whatever,</p>
<p>focus on users, what users are incredibly aggressive.</p>
<p>And so people just use a lot of obscenity</p>
<p>and exclamation points.</p>
<p>AI could easily code nastiness or just aggression, hostility.</p>
<p>And imagine if every user is rated</p>
<p>on a one to five scale for that.</p>
<p>And the default, when you open an account</p>
<p>on Twitter or Facebook, the default is four.</p>
<p>You will see everybody who&rsquo;s a four and below,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t even see the people who are fives</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get to see you.</p>
<p>So they can say what they want, free speech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not censoring them, they can say what they want.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s actually an incentive to not be an asshole</p>
<p>because the more of an asshole you are,</p>
<p>the more people block you out.</p>
<p>So imagine our country goes in two directions.</p>
<p>In one, things continue to deteriorate</p>
<p>and we have no way to have a public square</p>
<p>in which we could actually talk about things.</p>
<p>And in the other, we actually try</p>
<p>to disincentivize being an asshole</p>
<p>and encourage being constructive.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, this is because I&rsquo;m an AI person</p>
<p>and I very much, ever since I talked to Jack</p>
<p>about the health of conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at a lot</p>
<p>of the machine learning models involved.</p>
<p>And I believe that the nastiness classification</p>
<p>is a difficult problem automatically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it is.</p>
<p>So I personally believe</p>
<p>in crowdsourced nastiness labeling.</p>
<p>But in an objective way,</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t become viral mob cancellation</p>
<p>type of dynamics, but more sort of objectively,</p>
<p>is this a shady, almost out of context,</p>
<p>with only local context,</p>
<p>is this a shady thing to say at this moment?</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Well, wait, no, but we don&rsquo;t care about individual posts.</p>
<p>No, no, but-</p>
<p>All that matters is the average.</p>
<p>The posts make the man.</p>
<p>They do, but the point is,</p>
<p>as long as we&rsquo;re talking about averages here,</p>
<p>one person has a misclassified post, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but you need to classify posts</p>
<p>in order to build up the average.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>And so I really like that idea,</p>
<p>the high-level idea of incentivizing people</p>
<p>to be less shitty.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what, we have that incentive in real life.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really painful to be a full-time asshole,</p>
<p>I think, in physical reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you&rsquo;d be cut off.</p>
<p>It should be also pain to be an asshole on the internet.</p>
<p>There could be different mechanisms for that.</p>
<p>I wish AI was there, machine learning models were there.</p>
<p>They just aren&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>But how about, how about we have,</p>
<p>so one track is we have AI machine learning models,</p>
<p>and they render a verdict.</p>
<p>Another class is crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>You get, and then whenever the two disagree,</p>
<p>you have staff at Twitter or whatever,</p>
<p>they look at it and they say, well, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>And that way you can refine both the AI,</p>
<p>and you can refine whatever the algorithms are</p>
<p>for the crowdsourcing,</p>
<p>because of course that can be gamed,</p>
<p>and people can only, hey, let&rsquo;s all rate this guy</p>
<p>as really aggressive.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t want just to rely on one single track,</p>
<p>but if you have two tracks, I think you could do it.</p>
<p>What do you think about this word misinformation</p>
<p>that maybe connects to our two discussions now?</p>
<p>So one is the discussion of social media and democracy,</p>
<p>and then the other is the coddling of the American mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the word misinformation misused,</p>
<p>or used as a bullying word, like racism and so on,</p>
<p>which are important concepts to identify,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re nevertheless instead overused.</p>
<p>Does that worry you?</p>
<p>Because that seems to be the mechanism</p>
<p>from inside Twitter, from inside Facebook,</p>
<p>to label information you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>versus information that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>fundamentally harmful to society.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think there is a meaning of disinformation</p>
<p>that is very useful and helpful,</p>
<p>which is when you have a concerted campaign</p>
<p>by Russian agents to plant a story and spread it,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been doing that since the 50s or 40s even.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this podcast actually is.</p>
<p>Is what?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disinformation campaign by the Russians.</p>
<p>Yeah, you seem really Soviet to me, buddy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s between the lines.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So I think to the extent that there are campaigns</p>
<p>by either foreign agents,</p>
<p>or just by the Republican or Democratic parties,</p>
<p>there have been examples of that,</p>
<p>there are all kinds of concerted campaigns</p>
<p>that are intending to confuse or spread lies.</p>
<p>This is the Soviet, the firehose of falsehood tactic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very useful for that.</p>
<p>All the companies need to have pretty large staffs,</p>
<p>I think, to deal with that,</p>
<p>because that will always be there.</p>
<p>And that is really bad for our country.</p>
<p>So Renee Duresta is just brilliant on this.</p>
<p>Reading her work has really frightened me</p>
<p>and opened my eyes about how easy it is</p>
<p>to manipulate and spread misinformation,</p>
<p>and especially polarization.</p>
<p>The Russians have been trying since the 50s,</p>
<p>they would come to America and they would do hate crimes.</p>
<p>They would spray swastikas in synagogues</p>
<p>to make, and they spray anti-black slurs.</p>
<p>They try to make Americans feel</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re as divided as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the debate nowadays, however, is not that.</p>
<p>It seems to be people are talking about</p>
<p>what the other side is saying.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on the right,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re very conscious of the times when,</p>
<p>well, the left wouldn&rsquo;t let us even say,</p>
<p>could COVID be from a lab?</p>
<p>They would, you literally would get shut down</p>
<p>for saying that.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s at least a real likelihood that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It certainly is something that should have been talked about.</p>
<p>So I tend to stay away from any such discussions.</p>
<p>And the reason is twofold.</p>
<p>One is because they&rsquo;re almost entirely partisan.</p>
<p>It generally is each side thinks</p>
<p>what the other side is saying is misinformation</p>
<p>or disinformation, and they can prove certain examples.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not gonna get anywhere on that.</p>
<p>We certainly are never gonna get 60 votes in the Senate</p>
<p>for anything about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think content moderation</p>
<p>is nearly as important as people think.</p>
<p>It has to be done and it can be improved.</p>
<p>Almost all the action is in the dynamics,</p>
<p>the architecture, the virality,</p>
<p>and then the nature of who is on the platform,</p>
<p>unverified people, and how much amplification they get.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should be looking at</p>
<p>rather than wasting so much of our breath</p>
<p>on whether we&rsquo;re gonna do a little more</p>
<p>or a little less content moderation.</p>
<p>So the true harm to society on average</p>
<p>and over the long term is in the dynamics,</p>
<p>is fundamentally in the dynamics of social media,</p>
<p>not in the subtle choices of content moderation,</p>
<p>AKA censorship.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve always been conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>You know, the Turner Diaries is this book written in 1978.</p>
<p>It introduced the replacement theory to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Timothy McVeigh had it on him when he was captured in 1995</p>
<p>after the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a Bible of that fringe violent,</p>
<p>racist, white supremacist group.</p>
<p>And that, so, you know, the killer in Buffalo</p>
<p>was well acquainted with these ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve, you know, they&rsquo;ve been around,</p>
<p>but, you know, this guy&rsquo;s from a small town.</p>
<p>I forget where he&rsquo;s from.</p>
<p>You know, but he was, and he says in a manifesto,</p>
<p>he was entirely influenced by things he found online.</p>
<p>He was not influenced by anyone he met in person.</p>
<p>Ideas spread and communities can form,</p>
<p>these like micro communities can form</p>
<p>with bizarre and twisted beliefs.</p>
<p>And this is, again, back to the Atlantic article.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this amazing quote from Martin Goury.</p>
<p>I mean, just find it.</p>
<p>But he, Martin Goury, he was a former CIA analyst,</p>
<p>wrote this brilliant book called</p>
<p>The Revolt of the Public.</p>
<p>And he has this great quote.</p>
<p>He says, he talks about how in the age of mass media,</p>
<p>we were all, in a sense, looking at a mirror,</p>
<p>looking back at us.</p>
<p>And it might&rsquo;ve been a distorted mirror,</p>
<p>but we had stories in common.</p>
<p>We had facts in common.</p>
<p>It was mass media.</p>
<p>And he describes how the flood of information</p>
<p>with the internet is like a tsunami washing over us.</p>
<p>It has all kinds of effects.</p>
<p>And he says, this isn&rsquo;t a comment in an interview on Vox.</p>
<p>He says, the digital revolution has shattered that mirror.</p>
<p>And now the public inhabits those broken pieces of glass.</p>
<p>So the public isn&rsquo;t one thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly fragmented,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically mutually hostile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly people yelling at each other</p>
<p>and living in bubbles of one sort or another.</p>
<p>And so, we now see clearly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this little bubble of just bizarre nastiness,</p>
<p>in which the killer in Christchurch</p>
<p>and the killer in Norway and now in Buffalo,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all put into a community</p>
<p>and posts flow up within that community</p>
<p>by a certain dynamic.</p>
<p>So we can never stamp those words or ideas out.</p>
<p>The question is not, can we stop them from existing?</p>
<p>The question is, what platforms,</p>
<p>what are the platforms by which they spread</p>
<p>all over the world and into every little town</p>
<p>so that the 1% of whatever,</p>
<p>whatever percentage of young men are vulnerable to this,</p>
<p>that they get exposed to it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the dynamics and the architecture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating point to think about,</p>
<p>because we often debate and think about</p>
<p>the content moderation, the censorship,</p>
<p>the ideas of free speech,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying, yes, that&rsquo;s important to talk about,</p>
<p>but much more important is fixing the dynamics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, because everyone thinks,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s regulation, it means censorship.</p>
<p>At least people on the right think,</p>
<p>regulation equals censorship.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to say, no, no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only if all we talk about is content moderation.</p>
<p>Well, then yes, that is the framework.</p>
<p>How much or how little do we, you know?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even want to talk about that,</p>
<p>because all the action is in the dynamics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of my article.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the architecture changed</p>
<p>and our social world went insane.</p>
<p>So can you try to steel man the other side?</p>
<p>So the people that might say that social media</p>
<p>is good for society overall,</p>
<p>both in the dimension of mental health,</p>
<p>as Mark said, for teenagers, teenage girls,</p>
<p>and for our democracy.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of negative things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s slices of data.</p>
<p>If you look at the whole, which is difficult to measure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually good for society.</p>
<p>And to the degree that it&rsquo;s not good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting better and better.</p>
<p>Is it possible to steel man their point?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard, but I should be able to do it.</p>
<p>I need to put my money where my mouth is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So on the mental health front,</p>
<p>you know, the argument is usually what they say is,</p>
<p>well, you know, for communities that are cut off,</p>
<p>especially LGBTQ kids, they can find each other.</p>
<p>So it connects kids,</p>
<p>especially kids who wouldn&rsquo;t find connection otherwise.</p>
<p>It exposes you to a range of ideas and content,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Is there, in the studies you looked at,</p>
<p>is there inklings of data that&rsquo;s maybe early data</p>
<p>that shows that there&rsquo;s positive effects</p>
<p>in terms of self-report data,</p>
<p>or how would you measure behavioral positive?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Right, so if you look at how do you feel</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the platform,</p>
<p>you get a mix of positive and negative,</p>
<p>and people say they feel supported,</p>
<p>and this is what Mark was referring to when he said,</p>
<p>you know, there was like 18 criteria,</p>
<p>and on most it was positive, and on some it was negative.</p>
<p>So if you look at how do you feel</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re using the platform,</p>
<p>you know, look, most kids enjoy it, they&rsquo;re having fun,</p>
<p>but some kids are feeling inferior, cut off, bullied.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re saying what&rsquo;s the average experience</p>
<p>on the platform, that might actually be positive.</p>
<p>If we just measured the hedonics,</p>
<p>like how much fun versus fear is there,</p>
<p>it could well be positive.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to, okay,</p>
<p>so is that enough steel manning?</p>
<p>Can I?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You held your breath.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to point out is</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t a dose response sugar thing,</p>
<p>like how do you feel while you&rsquo;re consuming heroin?</p>
<p>Like while I&rsquo;m consuming heroin, I feel great,</p>
<p>but am I glad that heroin came into my life?</p>
<p>Am I glad that everyone in my seventh grade class</p>
<p>is on heroin?</p>
<p>Like, no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Like, I wish that people weren&rsquo;t on heroin</p>
<p>and they could play on the playground,</p>
<p>but instead they&rsquo;re just, you know,</p>
<p>sitting on the bench shooting up during recess.</p>
<p>So when you look at it as an emergent phenomenon</p>
<p>that changed childhood, now it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what are the feelings while you&rsquo;re actually using it.</p>
<p>We need to zoom out and say, how has this changed childhood?</p>
<p>Can you try to do the same for democracy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we can go back to, you know, what Mark said in 2012.</p>
<p>When he was taking Facebook public,</p>
<p>and you know, this is the wake of the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>I think people really have to remember</p>
<p>what an extraordinary year 2011 was.</p>
<p>It starts with the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>Dictators are pulled down.</p>
<p>Now people say, you know, Facebook took them down.</p>
<p>I mean, of course it was the citizen,</p>
<p>the people themselves took down dictators,</p>
<p>aided by Facebook and Twitter and,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was, or texting,</p>
<p>or there were some other platforms they used.</p>
<p>So the argument that Mark makes</p>
<p>in this letter to potential shareholders, investors,</p>
<p>is, you know, we&rsquo;re at a turning point in history.</p>
<p>And, you know, social media is rewiring.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re giving people the tools to rewire their institutions.</p>
<p>So this all sounds great.</p>
<p>Like this is the democratic dream.</p>
<p>And what I write about in the essay</p>
<p>is the period of techno-democratic optimism,</p>
<p>which began in the early 90s</p>
<p>with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And then the internet comes in and, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, people my age remember how extraordinary it was,</p>
<p>how much fun it was.</p>
<p>I mean, the sense that this was the dawning of a new age</p>
<p>and there was so much optimism.</p>
<p>And so this optimism runs all the way from the early 90s,</p>
<p>all the way through 2011 with the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>And of course that year ends with Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>And there were also big protest movements in Israel</p>
<p>and Spain and in a lot of areas.</p>
<p>Martin Goury talks about this.</p>
<p>So there certainly was a case to be made</p>
<p>that Facebook in particular, but all these platforms,</p>
<p>these were God&rsquo;s gift to democracy.</p>
<p>What dictator could possibly keep out the internet?</p>
<p>What dictator could stand up to people</p>
<p>connected on these digital media platforms?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the strong case</p>
<p>that this is gonna be good for democracy.</p>
<p>And then we can see what happened in the years after.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, so in Mark&rsquo;s response to you,</p>
<p>so here, let me read from what he said</p>
<p>when you interviewed him.</p>
<p>He says, I think it&rsquo;s worth grounding this conversation</p>
<p>in the actual research that has been done on this,</p>
<p>which by and large finds that social media</p>
<p>is not a large driver of polarization.</p>
<p>He says that.</p>
<p>Then he says, most academic studies that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>actually show that social media use</p>
<p>is correlated with lower polarization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a factual claim that he makes, which is not true.</p>
<p>But he asserts that study, well, actually wait,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricky because he says the studies he has seen.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t, so it might be that studies he has seen</p>
<p>say that, but if you go to the Google Doc with Chris Bale,</p>
<p>you see there are seven different questions</p>
<p>that can be addressed.</p>
<p>And on one of them, which is filter bubbles,</p>
<p>the evidence is very mixed.</p>
<p>And he might be right that Facebook overall</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t contribute to filter bubbles.</p>
<p>But on the other six, the evidence is pretty strongly</p>
<p>on the yes side, it is a cause.</p>
<p>And he also draws a line between the United States</p>
<p>versus the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Right, and there&rsquo;s one thing true about that,</p>
<p>which is that polarization has been rising</p>
<p>much faster in the US than in any other major country.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s right about that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about an article by Matt,</p>
<p>Matthew Genskow, and a few other researchers.</p>
<p>A very important article, we&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>in the political dysfunction database.</p>
<p>And we should say that in this study,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, like I started to say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating questions</p>
<p>that are, it&rsquo;s organized by whether studies</p>
<p>indicate yes or no.</p>
<p>Question one is, does social media make people</p>
<p>more angry or effectively polarized?</p>
<p>Question two is, does social media create echo chambers?</p>
<p>These are fascinating, really important questions.</p>
<p>Question three is, does social media amplify posts</p>
<p>that are more emotional, inflammatory, or false?</p>
<p>Question four is, does social media increase</p>
<p>the probability of violence?</p>
<p>Question five is, does social media enable</p>
<p>foreign governments to increase political dysfunction</p>
<p>in the US and other democracies?</p>
<p>Question six, does social media decrease trust?</p>
<p>Seven is, does social media strengthen populist movements?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s other sections, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, but once you operationalize it</p>
<p>as seven different questions,</p>
<p>so one is about polarization,</p>
<p>and there are measures of that,</p>
<p>the degree to which people say they hate the other side.</p>
<p>And so in this study by Boxell, Genskow, and Shapiro, 2021,</p>
<p>they looked at all the measures of polarization</p>
<p>they could find going back to the 1970s</p>
<p>for about 20 different countries.</p>
<p>And they show plots, you have these nice plots</p>
<p>with red lines showing that in some countries</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going up, like the United States especially,</p>
<p>in some countries it&rsquo;s going down,</p>
<p>and in some countries it&rsquo;s pretty flat.</p>
<p>And so Marx says, well, you know,</p>
<p>if polarization&rsquo;s going up a lot in the US</p>
<p>but not in most other countries,</p>
<p>well, maybe Facebook isn&rsquo;t responsible.</p>
<p>But so much depends on how you operationalize things.</p>
<p>Are we interested in the straight line regression line</p>
<p>going back to the 70s?</p>
<p>And if so, well, then he&rsquo;s right in what he says.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the argument.</p>
<p>The argument isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s been rising</p>
<p>or falling since the 70s.</p>
<p>The argument is it&rsquo;s been rising and falling</p>
<p>since 2012 or so.</p>
<p>And for that, now I just spoke with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been emailing with the authors of the study</p>
<p>and they say there&rsquo;s not really enough data</p>
<p>to do it statistically reliably</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s only a few observations after 2012.</p>
<p>But if you look at the graphs in their study,</p>
<p>and they actually do provide, as they pointed out to me,</p>
<p>they do provide a statistical test</p>
<p>if you break the data at the year 2000.</p>
<p>So actually a polarization is going up pretty widely</p>
<p>if you just look after 2000,</p>
<p>which is when the internet would be influential.</p>
<p>And if you look just after 2012,</p>
<p>you have to just do it by eye.</p>
<p>But if you do it on their graphs by eye,</p>
<p>you see that actually a number of countries</p>
<p>do see a sudden sharp upturn.</p>
<p>Not all, not all by any means.</p>
<p>But my point is, Mark asserts,</p>
<p>he points to one study and he points to this</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>I have had two conversations with him.</p>
<p>He pointed to this study both times.</p>
<p>He asserts that this study shows</p>
<p>that polarization is up some places,</p>
<p>down other places, there&rsquo;s no association.</p>
<p>But actually, we have another section in the Google Doc</p>
<p>where we review all the data on the decline of democracy.</p>
<p>And the high point of democracy,</p>
<p>of course, it was rising in the 90s.</p>
<p>But if you look around the world,</p>
<p>by some measures it begins to drop in the late 2000s,</p>
<p>around 2007, 2008.</p>
<p>By others, it&rsquo;s in the early to mid 2010s.</p>
<p>The point is, there is a, by many measures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a drop in the quality and the number of democracies</p>
<p>on this planet that began in the 2010s.</p>
<p>And so, yes, Mark can point to one study.</p>
<p>But if you look in the Google Doc,</p>
<p>there are a lot of other studies that point the other way.</p>
<p>And especially about whether things</p>
<p>are getting more polarized or less, more polarized.</p>
<p>Not in all countries, but in a lot.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve provided the problem,</p>
<p>several proposals for solutions.</p>
<p>Do you think Mark, do you think Elon or whoever</p>
<p>is at the head of Twitter</p>
<p>would be able to implement these changes?</p>
<p>Or does there need to be a competitor social network system</p>
<p>to step up?</p>
<p>If you were to predict the future,</p>
<p>no, this is you giving sort of financial advice to me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to.</p>
<p>Definitely not financial advice.</p>
<p>I can give you advice.</p>
<p>Do the opposite of whatever I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Okay, excellent.</p>
<p>But what do you think, when we talk again in 10 years,</p>
<p>what do you think we&rsquo;d be looking at if it&rsquo;s a better world?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to look at each,</p>
<p>the dynamics of each change that needs to be made.</p>
<p>And you have to look at it systemically.</p>
<p>And so the biggest change for teen mental health,</p>
<p>I think, is to raise the age from 13,</p>
<p>it was set to 13 in COPPA in like 1997 or six or whatever,</p>
<p>that was eight, whatever it was.</p>
<p>It was set to 13 with no enforcement.</p>
<p>I think it needs to go to 16 or 18 with enforcement.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no way that Facebook can say,</p>
<p>actually, so look, Instagram, the age is 13,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t enforce it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re under pressure to not enforce it</p>
<p>because if they did enforce it,</p>
<p>then all the kids would just go to TikTok,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re doing anyway.</p>
<p>But if we go back a couple of years,</p>
<p>when they were talking about rolling out Facebook for kids,</p>
<p>because they need to get those kids,</p>
<p>they need to get kids under 13.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a business imperative to hook them early</p>
<p>and keep them.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t expect Facebook to act on its own accord</p>
<p>and do the right thing because then they-</p>
<p>So regulation is the only way.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>When you have a social dilemma,</p>
<p>what economists call like a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</p>
<p>or a social dilemma is generalized to multiple people.</p>
<p>And when you have a social dilemma,</p>
<p>each player can&rsquo;t opt out because they&rsquo;re gonna lose.</p>
<p>You have to have central regulation.</p>
<p>So I think we have to raise the age.</p>
<p>The UK parliament is way ahead of us.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually functional.</p>
<p>The US Congress is not functional.</p>
<p>So the parliament is implementing</p>
<p>the age-appropriate design code</p>
<p>that may put pressure on the platforms globally</p>
<p>to change certain.</p>
<p>So anyway, my point is we have to have regulation</p>
<p>to force them to be transparent</p>
<p>and share what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There are some good bills out there.</p>
<p>So I think that if the companies and the users,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all stuck in a social dilemma</p>
<p>in which the incentives against doing the right thing</p>
<p>are strong, we do need regulation on certain matters.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not about content moderation.</p>
<p>Who gets to say what?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s things like the Platform Accountability</p>
<p>and Transparency Act, which is from Senators Coons,</p>
<p>Portman, and Klobuchar.</p>
<p>This would force the platforms to just share information</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even study what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>without the information.</p>
<p>So that I think is just common sense.</p>
<p>Senator Michael Bennett introduced</p>
<p>the Digital Platforms Commission Act of 2022,</p>
<p>which would create a body tasked with actually regulating</p>
<p>and having oversight.</p>
<p>Right now, the U.S. government doesn&rsquo;t have a body.</p>
<p>I mean, the FTC can do certain things.</p>
<p>We have things about antitrust,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a body that can oversee or understand</p>
<p>these things that are transforming everything</p>
<p>and possibly severely damaging our political life.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, and then the state of California</p>
<p>is actually currently considering a version</p>
<p>of the UK&rsquo;s, the Age-Appropriate Design Code,</p>
<p>which would force the companies to do some simple things</p>
<p>like not be sending alerts and notifications to children</p>
<p>at 10 or 11 o&rsquo;clock at night, just things like that</p>
<p>to make platforms just less damaging.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s an essential role for regulation.</p>
<p>And I think if the U.S. Congress</p>
<p>is too paralyzed by politics,</p>
<p>if the UK and the EU and the state of California</p>
<p>and a few other states, if they enact legislation,</p>
<p>the platforms don&rsquo;t wanna have different versions</p>
<p>in different states or countries.</p>
<p>So I think there actually is some hope,</p>
<p>even if the U.S. Congress is dysfunctional.</p>
<p>So there is, because I&rsquo;ve been interacting</p>
<p>with certain regulations that&rsquo;s hitting,</p>
<p>designed to hit Amazon, but it&rsquo;s hitting YouTube.</p>
<p>YouTube folks have been talking to me,</p>
<p>which is recommender systems.</p>
<p>The algorithm has to be public, I think,</p>
<p>versus private, which completely breaks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too clumsy a regulation</p>
<p>where the unintended consequences</p>
<p>break recommender systems, not for Amazon,</p>
<p>but for other platforms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just to say that government can sometimes</p>
<p>be clumsy with the regulation.</p>
<p>And so my preference is the threat of regulation</p>
<p>in a friendly way encourages, you really shouldn&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>My preference is great leaders lead the way</p>
<p>in doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And I actually, honestly, to our earlier</p>
<p>kind of maybe my naive disagreement</p>
<p>that I think it&rsquo;s good business</p>
<p>to do the right thing in these spaces.</p>
<p>So creating a product.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is, sometimes it loses you,</p>
<p>most of your users.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s important because I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>a lot about World War III recently.</p>
<p>And it might be silly to say,</p>
<p>but I think social media has a role</p>
<p>in either creating World War III</p>
<p>or avoiding World War III.</p>
<p>It seems like so much of wars throughout history</p>
<p>have been started through very fast escalation.</p>
<p>And it feels like just looking at our recent history,</p>
<p>social media is the mechanism for escalation.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really important to get this right,</p>
<p>not just for the mental health of young people,</p>
<p>not just for the polarization of bickering</p>
<p>over small scale political issues,</p>
<p>but literally the survival of human civilization.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot at stake here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I certainly agree with that.</p>
<p>I would just say that I&rsquo;m less concerned</p>
<p>about World War III than I am about Civil War II.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a more likely prospect.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I ask for your wise sage advice to young people?</p>
<p>So advice number one is put down the phone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use Instagram and social media.</p>
<p>But to young people in high school and college,</p>
<p>how to have a career or how to have a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d be happy to,</p>
<p>because I teach a course at NYU in the business school</p>
<p>called Work, Wisdom, and Happiness.</p>
<p>And the course is, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s advice on how to have a happy,</p>
<p>you know, a successful career as a human being.</p>
<p>But the course has evolved that it&rsquo;s now about three things,</p>
<p>how to get stronger, smarter, and more sociable.</p>
<p>If you can do those three things,</p>
<p>then you will be more successful at work</p>
<p>and in love and friendships.</p>
<p>And if you are more successful in work, love,</p>
<p>and friendships, then you will be happier.</p>
<p>You will be as happy as you can be, in fact.</p>
<p>So the question is,</p>
<p>how do you become smarter, stronger, and happier?</p>
<p>And the answer to all three is, it&rsquo;s a number of things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you have to see yourself</p>
<p>as this like complex adaptive system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this complicated mind</p>
<p>that needs a lot of experience to wire itself up.</p>
<p>And the most important part of that experience is</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>when you are with your attachment figure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t grow when you&rsquo;re safe.</p>
<p>You have an attachment figure to make you feel confident</p>
<p>to go out and explore the world.</p>
<p>In that world, you will face threats, you will face fear,</p>
<p>and sometimes you&rsquo;ll come running back.</p>
<p>But you have to keep doing it because over time,</p>
<p>you then develop the strength to stay out there</p>
<p>and to conquer it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s normal human childhood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we blocked in the 1990s in this country.</p>
<p>So young people have to get themselves the childhood,</p>
<p>and this is all the way through adolescence</p>
<p>and young adulthood.</p>
<p>They have to get themselves the experience</p>
<p>that older generations are blocking them from out of fear,</p>
<p>and that their phones are blocking them from</p>
<p>out of just hijacking almost all the inputs into their life</p>
<p>in almost all the minutes of their day.</p>
<p>So go out there, put yourself out in experiences.</p>
<p>You are anti-fragile and you&rsquo;re not gonna get strong</p>
<p>unless you actually have setbacks and criticisms and fights.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you get stronger.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an analogy in how you get smarter,</p>
<p>which is you have to expose yourself to other ideas,</p>
<p>to ideas that people that criticize you,</p>
<p>people that disagree with you.</p>
<p>And this is why I co-founded Heterodox Academy</p>
<p>because we believe that faculty need to be in communities</p>
<p>that have political diversity and viewpoint diversity,</p>
<p>but so do students.</p>
<p>And it turns out students want this.</p>
<p>The surveys show very clearly Gen Z</p>
<p>has not turned against viewpoint diversity.</p>
<p>Most of them want it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just afraid of the small number</p>
<p>that will sort of shoot darts at them</p>
<p>if they say something wrong.</p>
<p>So anyway, the point is you&rsquo;re anti-fragile,</p>
<p>and so you have to realize that to get stronger,</p>
<p>you have to realize that to get smarter.</p>
<p>And then the key to becoming more sociable is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just always looking at it</p>
<p>through the other person&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so focused on what you want</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re afraid of.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the other person&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to them?</p>
<p>What do they want?</p>
<p>And if you develop the skill of looking at it</p>
<p>from their point of view,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be a better conversation partner,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be a better life partner.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot that you can do.</p>
<p>I mean, I could say,</p>
<p>go read The Coddling of the American Mind.</p>
<p>I could say, go read Dale Carnegie,</p>
<p>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</p>
<p>But take charge of your life and your development,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>then the older protective generation and your phone</p>
<p>are gonna take charge of you.</p>
<p>So on anti-fragility and coddling the American mind,</p>
<p>if I may read just a few lines</p>
<p>from Chief Justice John Roberts,</p>
<p>which I find is really beautiful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about viewpoint diversity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s real struggle, absurd, unfair struggle</p>
<p>that seems to be formative to the human mind.</p>
<p>He says, from time to time in the years to come,</p>
<p>I hope you will be treated unfairly</p>
<p>so that you will come to know the value of justice.</p>
<p>I hope that you will suffer betrayal</p>
<p>because that will teach you the importance of loyalty.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely</p>
<p>from time to time so that you don&rsquo;t take friends for granted.</p>
<p>I wish you bad luck again from time to time</p>
<p>so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life</p>
<p>and understand that your success is not completely deserved</p>
<p>and that the failure of others</p>
<p>is not completely deserved either.</p>
<p>And when you lose, as you will from time to time,</p>
<p>I hope every now and then your opponent</p>
<p>will gloat over your failure.</p>
<p>It is a way for you to understand</p>
<p>the importance of sportsmanship.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll be ignored</p>
<p>so you know the importance of listening to others.</p>
<p>And I hope you will have just enough pain</p>
<p>to learn compassion.</p>
<p>Whether I wish these things or not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to happen.</p>
<p>And whether you benefit from them or not</p>
<p>will depend upon your ability</p>
<p>to see the message in your misfortunes.</p>
<p>He read that in a middle school graduation.</p>
<p>Yes, for his son&rsquo;s middle school graduation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was trying to say,</p>
<p>only that&rsquo;s much more beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think your work is really important</p>
<p>and it is beautiful and it&rsquo;s bold and fearless</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would sit with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan.</p>
<p>Thank you for spending your valuable time with me today,</p>
<p>John, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Lex, what a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jonathan Haidt.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.</p>
<p>Everything that irritates us about others</p>
<p>can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
