    <p>The following is a conversation with Ryan Schiller, creator of Librex, an anonymous</p>
<p>discussion feed for college communities starting at first with Yale, then the Ivy Leagues, and now</p>
<p>adding Stanford and MIT. Their mission is to give students a place to explore ideas and issues</p>
<p>in a positive way, but with much more personal and intellectual freedom than has defined college</p>
<p>campuses in recent history. I think this is a very difficult but worthy project. Quick thank you to</p>
<p>our sponsors, Allform, Magic Spoon, Better Help, and Brave. Click their links to support this</p>
<p>podcast. As a side note, let me say that Ryan is a young entrepreneur and genuine human being who</p>
<p>quickly won me over. He&rsquo;s inspiring in many ways, both in the struggle he had to overcome in his</p>
<p>personal life, but also in the fact that he did not know how to code, but saw a problem in this</p>
<p>world, in his community, that he cared about, and for that he learned to code and built a solution</p>
<p>in the best way he knew how. That&rsquo;s an important reminder for us humans. Let us not only complain</p>
<p>about the problems in the world, let us fix them. I also have to say that there&rsquo;s passion in Ryan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eyes for really wanting to make a difference in the world. His story, his effort, gives me hope</p>
<p>for the future. There is hate in this world, but I believe there&rsquo;s much more love, and I believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to build online platforms that connect us through our common humanity as we</p>
<p>explore difficult, personal, even painful ideas together. This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Ryan Shiller. Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. What is Librex?</p>
<p>What are its founding story and founding principles? And looking to the future,</p>
<p>what do you hope to achieve with Librex? Sure, let me break that down. So what is Librex? Librex is</p>
<p>an anonymous discussion feed for college campuses. It&rsquo;s a place where people can have important and</p>
<p>unfettered discussions and open discourse about topics they care about, ideas that matter,</p>
<p>and they can do all of that completely anonymously with verified members of their</p>
<p>college community. And we exist both on each Ivy League campus, and we have an interivy community,</p>
<p>and actually this week we just opened to MIT and Stanford. No, really? MIT? Yes! So we have</p>
<p>MIT and Stanford communities, and I expect you to sign up for your MIT account and start posting.</p>
<p>What are, for people who are not familiar like me actually, which are the Ivy Leagues? Sure,</p>
<p>so we started at Yale, which is my, I don&rsquo;t know, can you call it alma mater? Because I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>technically graduated. Yeah, what&rsquo;s that called when you&rsquo;re actually still there? My university?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess we&rsquo;ll just call it home. That&rsquo;s my home. Educational home. Started at my educational</p>
<p>home of Yale, and then we moved to, and we could get into the story of this eventually if you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like, and then we went to Dartmouth, and then quarantine hit. We opened to the rest of the</p>
<p>Ivy League, and now we have, and the Ivy League, for those who don&rsquo;t know, is Harvard, Yale,</p>
<p>Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, and Penn. I got it all in one breath. What&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>younger side of the league? Penn? No. Columbia. I can&rsquo;t say that on camera. We&rsquo;ll edit it in post.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll just say each of all eight of them, and then you can just like get it in.</p>
<p>Yeah. Penn, Harvard. There&rsquo;s actually a really nice software that people should check out,</p>
<p>like a service. It&rsquo;s using machine learning really nicely for podcast editing, where you can,</p>
<p>it learns the voice of the speaker, and it can change the words you said. It&rsquo;s like some deep</p>
<p>fake stuff. It&rsquo;s deep fake, but for positive applications. It&rsquo;s very interesting. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the only deep fake positive application I&rsquo;ve seen. I have a friend who&rsquo;s obsessed with deep fakes.</p>
<p>Yeah. What&rsquo;s great about, I think, deep fakes is that it&rsquo;s going to do the opposite of sort of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with our culture, where everyone will have plausible deniability. Yeah, exactly. I</p>
<p>mean, that&rsquo;s the hope for me is there&rsquo;s so many fake things out there that we&rsquo;re going to actually</p>
<p>be much more skeptical, and think, and take in multiple sources, and actually like reason,</p>
<p>like use common sense, and use like deep thinking to understand like what is true and what is not.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we used to have like traditional sources like the New York Times, and all these</p>
<p>kinds of publications that had a reputation. There are these institutions, and they&rsquo;re the source of</p>
<p>truth. And when you no longer can trust anything as a source of truth, you start to think on your</p>
<p>own. That gets part of the individual. That goes, that takes us way back to like where I came from,</p>
<p>the Soviet Union, where you can&rsquo;t really trust any one source of news. You have to think on your own.</p>
<p>You have to talk to your friends. Tremendous amount of intellectual autonomy, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Think about the societal consequences. Absolutely. I mean, we see so much decentralization in all</p>
<p>aspects of our digital lives now, but this is like the decentralization of thought. Yes. You</p>
<p>could say it&rsquo;s sadly, or I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sad, is decentralization of truth, where like truth is a</p>
<p>clustering thing, where you have these like this point cloud of people just swimming around, like</p>
<p>billions of them, and they all have certain ideas. And what&rsquo;s thought of as truth is almost like a</p>
<p>clustering algorithm. When you just get a bunch of people that believe the same thing, that&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also another truth, and there may be like multiple truths, and it&rsquo;s almost will be like</p>
<p>a battle of truths. Maybe even the idea of truth will like lessen its power in society that there</p>
<p>is such a thing as a truth. Because like the downside of saying something is true is it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>the downside of what people like religious people call scientism, which is like once science has</p>
<p>declared something as true, you can&rsquo;t no longer question it. But the reality is science is a</p>
<p>moving mechanism. You constantly question, you constantly questioning, and maybe truth should be</p>
<p>renamed as a process, not a final destination. The whole point is to keep questioning, keep questioning,</p>
<p>keep discovering. Kind of like we&rsquo;re going backwards in time. So like back when people were</p>
<p>sort of finding their identities and we were less globalized, right? Like people would get together</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d get together around common value system, common morals, and a common place. And those would</p>
<p>be sort of these clusters of their truth, right? And so we have all these different civilizations</p>
<p>and societies across the world that created their own truths. We talk about the Jews and the</p>
<p>Talmud and Torah. We look at Buddhist texts. We can look at all sorts of different truths and how</p>
<p>many of them get at the same things, but many of them have different ideas or different articulations.</p>
<p>Yeah, Harari and sapiens, it rewinds that even farther back into like caveman times. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that made us humans special, is who can develop these clusters of ideas, hold them in</p>
<p>their minds through stories, pass them on to each other, and it grows and grows. And finally, we have</p>
<p>Bitcoin. Which money is another belief system that has power only because we believe in it.</p>
<p>And is that truth? I don&rsquo;t know, but it has power. And it&rsquo;s carried in the minds of millions</p>
<p>and thereby has power. But back to Librex. So what&rsquo;s the founding story? What&rsquo;s the founding</p>
<p>principles of Librex? Sure. So I was on campus as a freshman, and I was talking to my friends.</p>
<p>Many of them felt like it was hard to raise your hand in class to ask a question. They really felt</p>
<p>like even outside the classroom, it was hard to be vulnerable. And the thing you have to understand</p>
<p>about Yale is it&rsquo;s not that big a place. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows you,</p>
<p>basically. And people come to these schools, first of all, they&rsquo;re home for people, and they want to</p>
<p>be themselves. They want to feel like they can be authentic. They want to make real friendships.</p>
<p>And second of all, it&rsquo;s a place where people go for intellectual vitality to explore important</p>
<p>ideas and to grow as thinkers. And fortunately, due to the culture, my friends expressed that</p>
<p>it was very difficult to do that. And I felt it, too. And then I couldn&rsquo;t talk to my professors.</p>
<p>And I remember I talked to one specific global affairs professor, and I was taking his class,</p>
<p>and his area of expertise was in the Middle Eastern conflict. And I went to him and I said,</p>
<p>Professor, we&rsquo;re almost finished this class. And we haven&rsquo;t even gotten to sort of the reason I</p>
<p>originally wanted to take the class was to hear about your perspective on the Middle Eastern</p>
<p>conflict. Because something I&rsquo;d learned at Yale, and this is maybe the most important thing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll flush it out a bit. Something I&rsquo;ve learned at Yale is that you can learn all sorts</p>
<p>of things from a textbook. And what you kind of go to Yale to do is to get the opinions of the</p>
<p>experts that go beyond the textbook and to have those more in depth conversations. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of the added value of going to a place like Yale and taking a course there as opposed to</p>
<p>just reading a textbook. But also interact with that opinion.</p>
<p>Exactly. To interact with that opinion, to hear it, to respond to it, to push back on it,</p>
<p>and to have that with some great minds. And there really are great minds at Yale,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me wrong. It&rsquo;s still a place of tremendous brilliance.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking to this professor, right? And I&rsquo;m like, I haven&rsquo;t heard your area of expertise.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, are we going to get to it? What&rsquo;s the deal? And this is during office hours,</p>
<p>mind you. So we&rsquo;re one on one. He says, Ryan, to be honest, I used to teach this area every</p>
<p>single year. In fact, I would do a section on it, which is like a small seminar, like breakaway</p>
<p>from the class where he would talk to the students in small groups and explain his perspective,</p>
<p>his research and have a real debate about it, like around a Harkness table. And he said,</p>
<p>I used to do this. And then about two years ago, a student reported me to the school and I realized</p>
<p>my job was at risk. And I realized the best course of action was basically just not to approach the</p>
<p>topic. And so now I just don&rsquo;t even mention it. And he&rsquo;s like, you can say whatever you want, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be a part of it. And it&rsquo;s a real shame. It&rsquo;s a real loss to</p>
<p>all of the students who I think came to the school to learn from these brilliant professors.</p>
<p>In that context of these world experts, the problem seems to be that reporting mechanism</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a disproportionate power to a complaint of a young student, a complaint that</p>
<p>an idea is painful or an idea is disrespectful to, you know, or ideas creating an unsafe space.</p>
<p>And the conclusion of that, I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with that because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>single reporting, maybe a couple, but that has more power than the idea itself. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strange. I don&rsquo;t know how to fix that in the administration except to fire everybody. So like</p>
<p>this is to push back against this storyline that academia is somehow fundamentally broken.</p>
<p>I think we have to separate a lot of things out. Like one is you have to look at faculty and you</p>
<p>have to look at the administration. And like at MIT, for example, the administration does, tries</p>
<p>to do well, but they&rsquo;re the ones that often lack courage. They&rsquo;re often the ones who are the source</p>
<p>of the problem. When people criticize academia, and I&rsquo;ll just speak to myself, you know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>willing to take heat for this, is they really are criticizing the administration, not the faculty</p>
<p>because the faculty oftentimes are the most brilliant, the bolder thinkers that you think.</p>
<p>Whenever you talk about we need like the truth to be spoken, the faculty are often the ones</p>
<p>who are in the possession of the deepest truths in their mind in that sense. And they also have</p>
<p>the capacity to truly educate in the way that you&rsquo;re saying. And so it&rsquo;s not broken, like</p>
<p>fundamentally, but there&rsquo;s stuff that like needs, that&rsquo;s not working that well. It needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>You kind of took my words. That&rsquo;s what I thought you were going to ask me if I think the Ivy League</p>
<p>is broken. That&rsquo;s totally, that&rsquo;s exactly it. So you don&rsquo;t think, yeah. So on the question,</p>
<p>do you think the Ivy League is broken? Like what, how do you think about it? The academia in general,</p>
<p>I suppose, but Ivy League still, I think it represents some of the best qualities of academia.</p>
<p>What more is there to say there? I think the Ivy League is producing tremendous thinkers to this</p>
<p>day. I think the culture has a lot that can be improved, but I have a lot of faith in the people</p>
<p>who are in these institutions. I think, like you said, the administration, and I have to be a</p>
<p>little careful because I&rsquo;ve been in some of these committees and I&rsquo;ve talked to the administration</p>
<p>about these sorts of things. I think they have a lot of stakeholders and unfortunately it makes</p>
<p>it difficult for them to always serve these brilliant faculty and the students in the way</p>
<p>that they would probably like to. Yeah. Okay. So this is me speaking, right? The administration,</p>
<p>I know the people, and they&rsquo;re oftentimes the faculty holding positions in these committees,</p>
<p>right? Yes. But it&rsquo;s in the role of quote unquote service. They&rsquo;re trying to do well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to do good. But I think you could say it&rsquo;s the mechanism is not working,</p>
<p>but I could also say my personal opinion is they lack courage, and one, courage, and two,</p>
<p>grace when they walk through the fire. So courage is stepping into the fire,</p>
<p>and grace when you walk through the fire is like maintaining that like as opposed to being rude</p>
<p>and insensitive to the lived quote unquote experience of others or like, you know,</p>
<p>just not eloquent at all. Like as you step in and take the courageous step of talking and saying</p>
<p>the difficult thing, doing it well, like doing it skillfully. So both of those are important,</p>
<p>the courage and the skill to communicate difficult ideas, and they often lack them because they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t trained for it, I think. So you can blame the mechanisms that don&rsquo;t, that allow 19, 20 year</p>
<p>old students to have more power than the entire faculty, or you could just say that the faculty</p>
<p>need to step up and grow some guts and skill of graceful communication. And really administration.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. And the administration. That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s the administration.</p>
<p>Because the faculty are sometimes some of the most brave outspoken people within the bounds</p>
<p>of their career. Yeah. So that takes a, that&rsquo;s like the founding kind of spark of a fire that</p>
<p>led you to then say, okay, so how can I help? Yeah. And I explored a lot. I explored a lot</p>
<p>of options. I wrote many articles to my friends, talked to them, and I realized it sort of needed</p>
<p>to be a cultural change. Sort of need to be bottom up, grassroots. Something, I knew the energy was</p>
<p>there because you just look at the most recent institutional assessment from Yale. This was</p>
<p>basically the number one thing that students, faculty, and alumni all pointed to, to the</p>
<p>administration was cultivating more conversations on campus and more difficult conversations on</p>
<p>campus. So the people on campus know it. And you look at a Gallup poll, 61% of students are on</p>
<p>Ivy League campuses, afraid to speak their minds because of the campus culture. The campus culture</p>
<p>is causing a sort of freezing effect on discourse. Can you pause on that again? So what percentage</p>
<p>of students feel afraid to speak their mind? 61% nationally. And then you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>you know, places, nothing like the Ivy League where I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;d imagine it would be even worse</p>
<p>because of just the way that these communities kind of come about and the sorts of people who</p>
<p>are attracted or are invited to these sorts of communities. That&rsquo;s nationwide that college</p>
<p>students, and it&rsquo;s going up, that college students are afraid to say what they believe because of</p>
<p>their campus climate. So it&rsquo;s a majority. It&rsquo;s not a conservative thing. It&rsquo;s not a liberal thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a group thing. We&rsquo;re all feeling it. The majority of us are feeling it.</p>
<p>And basically just, it doesn&rsquo;t even, you don&rsquo;t even necessarily</p>
<p>need to have anything to say. You just have a fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re like teaching, you know, metaphor is a really powerful thing to explain,</p>
<p>you know, and there&rsquo;s just the caution that you feel that&rsquo;s just horrible for humor. Now,</p>
<p>comedians have the freedom to just talk shit, which is why I really appreciate somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a friend recently, Tim Dillon, who gives zero, pardon my French, fucks about anything,</p>
<p>which is very liberating, very important person to just tear down the powerful.</p>
<p>But, you know, inside the academia as an educator, as a teacher, as a professor,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the same freedom. So that fear is felt, I guess, by a majority of students.</p>
<p>And you were getting at something there too, which is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re afraid to speak metaphorically, if you&rsquo;re afraid to speak imprecisely,</p>
<p>it can be very difficult to actually think at all and to think to the extremities of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>capable of, because these are the mechanisms we use when we don&rsquo;t have quite the precise</p>
<p>mathematical language to quite pinpoint what we&rsquo;re talking about yet. This is the beginning. This is</p>
<p>the creative step that leads to new knowledge. And so that really scares me is that if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>allowed to sort of excavate these things, these ideas with people in the sort of messy, sloppy way</p>
<p>that we do as humans when we&rsquo;re first being creative, are we going to be able to continue</p>
<p>to innovate? Are we going to continue to be able to learn? And that&rsquo;s what really starts to scare me.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve explored a bunch of different ideas. You ordered a bunch of different stuff.</p>
<p>How did lead bricks come about?</p>
<p>Basically, it came to me that it had to be kind of a grassroots movement and it had to be something</p>
<p>that changed culturally. And it had to be relatively personal, people meeting people,</p>
<p>people finding out that, no, I&rsquo;m not the only one on campus who feels this way. I feel alone. And</p>
<p>there are a lot of other people who feel alone. I believe this thing. And it&rsquo;s not as unpopular as</p>
<p>I thought. Basically, creating heterodoxy of thought. And it&rsquo;s creating that moment where</p>
<p>you realize that your politics are personal and that your politics are shared by a lot of people</p>
<p>on campus. And so I just started coding it. I didn&rsquo;t have much coding experience, but went</p>
<p>headfirst in and figured how hard could it be? I mean, this is really fascinating. So I talked to a</p>
<p>lot of software engineers, AI people. Obviously, that&rsquo;s where my passion, my interests are.</p>
<p>My focus has been throughout my life. The fascinating thing about your story, I think it</p>
<p>should be truly inspiring to people that want to change the world, is that you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>background in programming. You don&rsquo;t have even maybe a technical background. So you saw a problem,</p>
<p>you explored different ideas, and then you just decided you&rsquo;re going to learn how to build an app</p>
<p>without a technical background. That&rsquo;s so bold. That is so beautiful, man. Can you take me through</p>
<p>the journey of deciding to do that, of learning to program without a programming background,</p>
<p>and building the app? Detail, how do you start?</p>
<p>Sure. You want to buy a Mac? I&rsquo;m just going to go step by step. I&rsquo;ll be as dumb as possible.</p>
<p>Because it was truly leading by your feet.</p>
<p>So you need a computer for this?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I had a PC at the time, and I was Android at the time. And I realized it should</p>
<p>be an iOS app. And so that was a decision. But I knew kids these days, they&rsquo;re always on their</p>
<p>phone. And I wanted you to be able to say a passing thought in class. You&rsquo;re walking around,</p>
<p>and you have a thought, and you can express it. Or you&rsquo;re in the dining hall, and you have your</p>
<p>phone out, you can express it. So it was clear to me it should be an iOS app.</p>
<p>By the way, Android is great. Definitely check it out.</p>
<p>We also are now available on Android, but we&rsquo;ll get there,</p>
<p>for the new Android users from MIT, Stanford, or the Ivy League. So back to how it happened. So I</p>
<p>realized I need a Mac. So I went out and got a Mac. And I realized I need an iPhone for testing</p>
<p>eventually. Got an iPhone. So those were the real robot blocks to start with. From there, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost too much information out there about programming. And the question is, where</p>
<p>do you start, and what&rsquo;s going to be useful to you? And my first thought was I should look at some</p>
<p>Yale classes. But it became very clear, very quickly, that that was not the right place to start.</p>
<p>That would probably be the right place to start if I wanted to get a job at Amazon,</p>
<p>but my goal was slightly different. And I definitely had it in mind that what I was</p>
<p>trying to make was I&rsquo;m trying to prove out an idea. I&rsquo;m not trying to make a finished product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get to the first step. Because I figured if I keep getting to the next step,</p>
<p>at least I won&rsquo;t die now. At least things will move forward. I&rsquo;ll learn new things. Maybe I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>meet new people. I&rsquo;ll show a degree of seriousness about what I&rsquo;m doing. And things will come</p>
<p>together. And that is, as you&rsquo;ll see, what ends up happening. So I start with Swift. And I find</p>
<p>this video from the Stanford professor that had a million views that was how to make, basically,</p>
<p>Swift apps perfect. And you just like, so you got this Mac, and you go to google.com,</p>
<p>and you type in Xcode. And then I type in on YouTube like Stanford, iOS, Swift, enter.</p>
<p>First YouTube video has a million views. I&rsquo;m like, it has to be good at Stanford has a million</p>
<p>views. I got lucky. I mean, that turned out to be a very good video. It&rsquo;s basically like</p>
<p>introductory course to Swift. Yeah. I mean, you say introductory. I think most of the people in</p>
<p>that class probably had a much better background than I did software developers probably computer</p>
<p>scientists. And it was slow for me. I don&rsquo;t think I realized it fully at the time just how far</p>
<p>behind I was from the rest of the class because I was like, wow, it seems like people are picking</p>
<p>this up really quickly. So it took a little longer and you know, a lot of time on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>But eventually I made a truly minimal viable product. The most minimal like we&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>you know, put text on screen, add text to screen, comment on top of text, you know,</p>
<p>make a post, make a response. And anyone with a Yale email can do this. And you plug it into</p>
<p>a certain cloud server and you verify people&rsquo;s accounts. And you you&rsquo;re off you have to figure</p>
<p>out how to like the whole idea of like having an account. So there&rsquo;s a permanence like you can</p>
<p>create an account with an email, verify it, verify it. OK, so that that&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s literally how I thought about it. Right. Like, so what do I need to do? And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, well, first thing I need is a login page. And I&rsquo;m like, how to make a login page in Swift.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that easy. If someone this has been done before, of course. And then the first page</p>
<p>that pops up is probably a pretty damn good page when it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect. But</p>
<p>like maybe it got me 80 percent of the way there. And then I came into some bugs and then, you know,</p>
<p>I asked Stack Overflow a few questions and then I got a little further and then I found some more</p>
<p>bugs. And then I&rsquo;m like, maybe this isn&rsquo;t the right way to do. Maybe I should do it this way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure my code isn&rsquo;t great, but the goal isn&rsquo;t to make great code. The goal wasn&rsquo;t to</p>
<p>make scalable code. It was to understand, is this something my friends will use? Like,</p>
<p>what is the reaction going to be if I put it in their hands and am I capable of making this thing?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s awesome. And so you&rsquo;re focusing on the experience, like actually just really driving</p>
<p>towards that first step, figuring out the first step and really driving towards it. Of course,</p>
<p>you have to also figure out like this concept of like storage, like database.</p>
<p>You know something funny?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I just made the database structure with no knowledge of databases whatsoever.</p>
<p>And I start showing it to my friends who have an experience in CS and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you used to heap. That&rsquo;s so interesting. You&rsquo;re like, why did you decide to store it in this way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, bro, I don&rsquo;t even know what a heap is. I just did it because it works. Like I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to make calls and stuff. And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, they&rsquo;re like, the hierarchy is really like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a deep profound lesson in there that I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve interacted</p>
<p>with computer science people since, but they tend to optimize and have these kinds of discussions.</p>
<p>And what leads, what results is over optimization. It&rsquo;s like worrying, is this really the right way</p>
<p>to do it? And then you go as opposed to doing the first thing on Stack Overflow, you go down this</p>
<p>like rabbit hole of what&rsquo;s the actual proper way to do it. And then you&rsquo;re like, you wake up five</p>
<p>years later working on Amazon because you&rsquo;ve never finished the login page. Like it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>hilarious, but that&rsquo;s a really deep lesson. Like just get it done. And there&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s a heap,</p>
<p>bro? Is the right, that should be a t shirt. That&rsquo;s really the right approach to building something</p>
<p>that ultimately creates an experience. And then you iterate eventually. That&rsquo;s how the great,</p>
<p>some of the greatest software products in this world have been built is you create it quickly</p>
<p>and then just iterate. What was, by the way, in your mind, the thing that you were chasing as a</p>
<p>prototype? Like what, what was the first step that it feels like something is working? Like did you</p>
<p>see you interacting with another friend? Yeah. I think the first step was like, it&rsquo;s one thing to</p>
<p>tell someone about an idea, but it&rsquo;s another thing to put in their hands and kind of see like the way</p>
<p>their, their eyes kind of look. And when I&rsquo;d go, I&rsquo;d walk around cross campus, which is part of</p>
<p>Yale, and I&rsquo;d literally just go up to people and run up to them and be like, try this, try this,</p>
<p>you got to try this. This is pre quarantine, by the way, of course, this would never be the same</p>
<p>post quarantine, but like, you got to try this, you got to try this. Like, what is it? And I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like, and I explain it&rsquo;s like an anonymous discussion feed for our Yale campus. And you see</p>
<p>their gears turning and they just, some people would be like, not interested. I&rsquo;m like, fine,</p>
<p>not your target demographic. I get it. You&rsquo;ll come eventually. But some people like you could see it,</p>
<p>they got it. They&rsquo;re like, yes. And that&rsquo;s when I was like, okay, okay, there is, and you don&rsquo;t need,</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need 50% of people to like it. You need what, 5%, 10% to love it. And then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell 5%, 10%. Yeah, word of mouth. And you&rsquo;re good. Of course, the first version was</p>
<p>very, very crappy, but seeing people trying despite all the crappiness wasn&rsquo;t, it was sort of enough</p>
<p>to be the first step. And since then, all of my code has been stripped out. I now have friends</p>
<p>who basically have told me, don&rsquo;t bother with the coding part. You do the rest. You just make sure</p>
<p>that we can code because they want to code. Great. I mean, I&rsquo;m not an engineer. I never intended to</p>
<p>be an engineer. And there&rsquo;s a lot to do that&rsquo;s not engineering. But the point was just to validate</p>
<p>the idea, so to speak. When was the moment that you felt like we&rsquo;ve created something special?</p>
<p>Maybe a moment where you&rsquo;re proud of that this is, this has the potential to actually be the very</p>
<p>implementation of the idea that I initially had. There&rsquo;s so many little moments. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and I bet there&rsquo;ll still be moments in the future that make it hard to like totally say, like. Yeah,</p>
<p>we should say this is, this is still very early days of Librex. It&rsquo;s only been a year since we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had like actual, like a lot of people on the app. Yeah. About a year. Oh wow. Okay. I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some crazy moments I could talk about sort of going to Dartmouth because it&rsquo;s one thing to</p>
<p>like get some traction at your school. People know you and you know, it&rsquo;s your school, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another thing to go to another school and where no one knows you and sign up 90% of the</p>
<p>campus overnight. Wow. So tell me that story. You&rsquo;re invading another territory. It was literally</p>
<p>like that. Did you buy it like a Dartmouth sweatshirt? Purposefully, I didn&rsquo;t want to fraud</p>
<p>anyone, but I was purposefully nondescript in my clothing. Yeah. No Yale stuff, no Dartmouth stuff.</p>
<p>Just blended. I&rsquo;ll go back there. So what happened was this was like March of last year. So almost,</p>
<p>almost a year ago today. And I really wanted to see if we could go from sort of one campus to two</p>
<p>campuses. So I didn&rsquo;t know anyone at Dartmouth&rsquo;s campus, but I kind of, I had some cold emails,</p>
<p>some warmish emails. And I went to people and I was like, basically, can I sleep on your floor for</p>
<p>two days during finals period? I had a lot of people who said, this is crazy. Like no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to, no one wants to download an app during finals period, a social app during finals period.</p>
<p>But I emailed a few people. I was like, you know, can I sleep on your floor? And one of them</p>
<p>was crazy enough to say, sure, come to my, come to my dorm. I have a nice floor. And he ended up,</p>
<p>today, he&rsquo;s still really close. He&rsquo;s a really close friend. But anyway, I take a train,</p>
<p>knowing nothing about this guy besides his first and last name. And I arrive and Dartmouth is</p>
<p>really, really remote, way more remote than you think to the point where I&rsquo;m like, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he warned me. He&rsquo;s a really hospitable guy. He warned me like, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to get to</p>
<p>campus from the train station because it&rsquo;s really remote. And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just get an Uber. There are no Ubers in Hanover. What do you think this is?</p>
<p>This is New Hampshire. So, Connecticut, I mean, Yale is pretty remote as well, no?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yale is, well, I mean, Yale is in New Haven, which is a real city. It has Ubers. It has food.</p>
<p>It has culture. It has a nightclub even. Like, we&rsquo;re talking about a real city. Like, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>New York. It&rsquo;s not Philadelphia, where I&rsquo;m from, but it&rsquo;s a city. New Hampshire is something very</p>
<p>different. Yeah. Beautiful campus, I&rsquo;m sure. Beautiful. Oh, my gosh. I could talk so much</p>
<p>about, I was blown away by Dartmouth. I started wondering like why I didn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>Legitimately, between the people and the culture, it was a beautiful vacation. So,</p>
<p>I arrived there, no Uber, but eventually I call this guy who&rsquo;s like the only guy who can get you</p>
<p>to Dartmouth and it takes a couple hours, but we get there. I sleep on this guy&rsquo;s floor. I wake up.</p>
<p>I ask him if there&rsquo;s any printing. He&rsquo;s like, oh, Dartmouth happens to have free printing in</p>
<p>the copy room. I print out like 2000 posters until the guy in the copy room literally goes to me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, kid, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, but you need to get out of here. I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, I&rsquo;m going. I found the limits. Yeah, I found the limit. I think a lot of startups</p>
<p>about finding the limits. That&rsquo;s a little piece of advice. Socially, he&rsquo;s like, you got to get</p>
<p>out of here. I then go to every single dorm door. I put a poster under every single dorm door,</p>
<p>advertising the app with a QR code. I walk around campus saying hi to everyone</p>
<p>and telling them about the app. I go from table to table in the cafeteria, introduce myself,</p>
<p>say hi and tell them to download the app. It&rsquo;s an exhausting day. So many steps,</p>
<p>so many crotching down to slip the poster under the dorm door. My legs were burning.</p>
<p>But by the end of it, 24 hours later, I&rsquo;m sitting in a bus and I&rsquo;m just pressing the refresh button</p>
<p>on the account creation panels. It&rsquo;s like going up by hundreds. And I&rsquo;m like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>The word of mouth is working in a sense. I mean, certainly your initial seed is powerful.</p>
<p>Just a piece.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then the word of mouth is what carries it forward. And what was the explanation you gave</p>
<p>to the app? Is anonymity a fundamental part of it? Like saying, this is a chance</p>
<p>for you to speak your mind about your experiences on campus.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people get it. What I&rsquo;ve realized is you don&rsquo;t need to tell people</p>
<p>why to try it. They know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hunger for this.</p>
<p>Exactly. So all I do is I&rsquo;m very factual. I said, and this is where I kind of ended up coining the</p>
<p>line that I now used to say it because I said it so many times in those 24 hours.</p>
<p>I just said, it&rsquo;s an anonymous discussion feed for Dartmouth. And they&rsquo;re like, yes.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve been waiting for it. Some people are more skeptical, but a lot of people were like,</p>
<p>great, I&rsquo;m excited to try this. I&rsquo;m excited to meet people and connect. And I mean,</p>
<p>the way Dartmouth is taken to is incredible. Everything from professors writing poems during</p>
<p>finals period to be like, good luck in finals period. You&rsquo;re going to rise like a Phoenix</p>
<p>or whatever to like, yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy. To I heard about two women meeting on Librex and</p>
<p>starting a finance club at Dartmouth to significant others meeting. There was an article recently</p>
<p>written up at Yale as well about two queer women who met on Librex and started a relationship,</p>
<p>which was pretty, it was pretty interesting to see people throwing parties pre COVID. Yeah.</p>
<p>It was just amazing to see how, when you allow people to be vulnerable and social,</p>
<p>they connect. People have this natural desire to connect.</p>
<p>Yeah. When, when you have, would have a natural desire to have a voice. And then when that voice</p>
<p>is, is paired with freedom, that you could truly express yourself and there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>liberating about that. And in that sense, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re connecting as your true self,</p>
<p>whatever that is. What are the most powerful conversation you&rsquo;ve seen on the app? You mentioned</p>
<p>like people connecting. The hard part of that, that is the sorting, you know, figuring out which</p>
<p>one, which one am I going to put at the top? Mental sorting out. Just something that stands</p>
<p>out to you. Sorry. I don&rsquo;t mean to do like the top 10 conversations ever of all time,</p>
<p>ever on the app. I just mean like stuff that you remember that stands out to you.</p>
<p>I remember this one really amazing comment from this. He was a Mexican international student</p>
<p>who spoke out and this, this, this post was super edgy, but yet it got hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p>upvotes within the Yale community. It was a Yale community specific post. And we should point out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a school specific community now and there&rsquo;s an all Ivy community. So this was</p>
<p>specifically in the Yale community. And this was a little while ago, but it stuck with me. This</p>
<p>Mexican international student comes to Yale and he starts talking about his experience</p>
<p>in the La Casa, which is the Mexican Latina X as they would say, cultural center at Yale,</p>
<p>and how he doesn&rsquo;t feel welcome there because he&rsquo;s Roman Catholic basically and international</p>
<p>and how he doesn&rsquo;t feel like he fits with their agenda. And as a result, this place that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be home for him, he feels outcasted and feels more alone than he does anywhere else</p>
<p>on campus. That&rsquo;s powerful. That was powerful to me. Yeah. It&rsquo;s hearing someone, someone who should</p>
<p>be feeling supported by this culture say, actually, this is not doing anything for me. Like this is</p>
<p>not helping me. This is not where I feel at home. So what do you make of anonymity?</p>
<p>Because it seems to be a fundamental aspect of the power of the app, right? But at the same time,</p>
<p>anonymity on the internet, so it protects us, right? It gives us freedom to have a voice,</p>
<p>but it can also bring out the dark sides of human nature, like trolls or people who want</p>
<p>to be malicious, want to hurt others purely for the joy of hurting others, being cruel for fun</p>
<p>and going to the dark places. So like, what do you make of anonymity as a fundamental feature</p>
<p>of social interaction, like the pros and the cons? Yeah. Just to break that down a bit,</p>
<p>I would say a lot of those same things about a place like Twitter where people are very</p>
<p>unanonymous. Having said that, of course, there&rsquo;s a different sort of capacity people have when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re anonymous, right? In all different sorts of ways. So what do I make of anonymity? I think</p>
<p>it can be incredibly liberating and allow people to be incredibly vulnerable and to connect in</p>
<p>different ways, both on politics, and there was a lot to talk about this year regarding politics,</p>
<p>and personally being vulnerable, talking about relationships and mental health.</p>
<p>I think it allows people to have a community that&rsquo;s not performative.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s this other side where people can sometimes break rules or say things</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise say that people don&rsquo;t always agree with or that people might</p>
<p>find repugnant. And to an extent, these can facilitate great conversations. And on the other</p>
<p>hand, we have to have moderation in place, and we have to have community guidelines to make sure</p>
<p>that the anonymity doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm the purpose, which is that anonymity, first of all, anonymity</p>
<p>is a tool in Librex. It was not the purpose of Librex. It is a way that we get towards these</p>
<p>authentic conversations given our campus climate. And second of all, I would say it&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Librex is anonymous because Librex isn&rsquo;t totally anonymous. Everyone&rsquo;s a verified</p>
<p>Ivy League student. You know exactly what school everyone goes to. You only have one account per</p>
<p>person at Yale. I mean, what that amounts to is people have more of an ownership in the community</p>
<p>and people know that they&rsquo;re connected and they have a common vernacular.</p>
<p>So the anonymity is a scale and it&rsquo;s a tool. But you can also trust, I mean, this is the</p>
<p>difference between Reddit anonymity, where you can easily create multiple accounts.</p>
<p>When you have only one account per person, or at least it&rsquo;s very difficult to create multiple</p>
<p>accounts, then you can trust that the anonymous person you&rsquo;re talking to is a human being.</p>
<p>Not a bot.</p>
<p>I try to be completely unanonymous now in my all public interactions. I try to be as real in every</p>
<p>way possible, like zero gap between private me and public me.</p>
<p>Why exactly did you, it seems like this is an intentional mission. What made you want to sort</p>
<p>of bridge that gap between the private sphere and public sphere? Because that&rsquo;s unique. I know a</p>
<p>lot of intellectuals who would make a different decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting. I had a discussion with Naval about this, actually, with a few others that</p>
<p>have a very clear distinction between public and private.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;m struggling with, by the way, personally, and thinking about.</p>
<p>So one on the very basic surface level is if you carry with yourself lies, small lies or big lies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extra mental effort to remember what you&rsquo;re supposed to say and not supposed to say.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on a very surface level of like, it&rsquo;s just easier to live life when you have</p>
<p>the smaller the gap between the private you and the public you.</p>
<p>And the second is, I think for me, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m dishonest with others, I will too quickly become dishonest with myself.</p>
<p>And in so doing, I will not truly be able to think deeply about the world and come up</p>
<p>and build revolutionary ideas. There&rsquo;s something about honesty that feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that first principles thinking that&rsquo;s almost like overused as a term, but it feels like that</p>
<p>requires radical honesty, not radical asshole and lishness, but radical honesty with yourself,</p>
<p>with yourself. And it feels like it&rsquo;s difficult to be radically honest with yourself when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being dishonest with the public. And also I have a nice feature, honestly, that in this current</p>
<p>social context, so we can talk about race and gender and what are the other topics that are</p>
<p>touchy?</p>
<p>Ethnicity and nationality.</p>
<p>All those things. I mean, like.</p>
<p>Family structure.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m ineloquent in the way I speak about them, but I honestly, when I look in the mirror,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not deeply hateful of a particular race or even just hateful particular race.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m biased and I&rsquo;ve tried to like think about those biases and so on. And also, I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>creepy shit in my closet. It seems like a lot of people did a lot of creepy stuff in their life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a bit of a platform. And I think it all started when I went to this female comedian, Whitney</p>
<p>Brown, and I was like, you know, I really value love, long term monogamy with like one person. And it&rsquo;s like, I</p>
<p>really value liberating as a human being. Forget public, all that. Because then I feel like I&rsquo;m on sturdy ground when I say</p>
<p>difficult things. And at the same time, sorry, I&rsquo;m ranting on this. I apologize.</p>
<p>Like I won&rsquo;t be able to fake it. Like they&rsquo;ll see it through. Yeah. So I feel like if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>lying about stuff, you have the freedom to truly be yourself. And the internet will figure it out.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll figure who you are. People have a natural tendency to be able to tell bullshit.</p>
<p>It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, right? Exactly. Like why? Why wouldn&rsquo;t, why, like, of all the things that we could evolve to be good at,</p>
<p>being able to detect honesty seems like one that would be particularly valuable,</p>
<p>especially in the sorts of societies we developed into. And then also from a selfish perspective,</p>
<p>like a success perspective, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of folks that have inspired me, like Elon is one of them,</p>
<p>that shows that there&rsquo;s a hunger for genuineness. Like you can build a business as a CEO and be</p>
<p>genuine and like real and do stupid shit every once in a while, as long as it&rsquo;s coming from the</p>
<p>same place of who you truly are. Like Elon is inspirational with that. And then there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>other people I admire that are counter inspirations in the sense like they&rsquo;re very formal. They hold</p>
<p>back a lot of themselves. And it&rsquo;s like, I know how brilliant those people are. And I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not being as effective of leaders, public faces of companies as they could be. I mean, to be honest,</p>
<p>like not to throw shade, but I will, it&rsquo;s like Mark Zuckerberg is an example of that. Jack Dorsey is</p>
<p>also a bit of an example of that. I like Jack a lot. I&rsquo;ve talked to him a lot. I will talk to him</p>
<p>more. I think he&rsquo;s a much more amazing person than he conveys through his public presentation. I think</p>
<p>a lot of that has to do with PR and marketing people having an effect. This is difficult. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult. It&rsquo;s probably many of the same difficulties you will face as the pressures.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do. But I think as much as possible as an individual, you should try</p>
<p>to be honest in the face of the world and the company that wants you to be more polished. And</p>
<p>that being more polished turns you into a politician and politician eventually turns into</p>
<p>being dishonest. Dishonest with the world and dishonest with yourself.</p>
<p>Something I noticed, which was of the people you mentioned, those things have had ramifications</p>
<p>in terms of letting things go too far or get out of hand. And you wonder, it&rsquo;s an aspect of lying,</p>
<p>right? You say one lie goes to another lie. You push it down. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can figure</p>
<p>it out later. You can figure it out later. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ve dug a pretty big hole. And I think</p>
<p>if we look at Twitter and we look at Facebook, I think it goes without saying what sorts of holes</p>
<p>have been dug because of, perhaps because of a lack of honesty that goes all the way up to the</p>
<p>leaders. So yeah, there&rsquo;s two problems within the company. It doesn&rsquo;t make you as effective of a</p>
<p>leader, I think. That&rsquo;s one. And two, for social media companies, I think people need to trust,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the CEO, but it has to be like, this is how humans work. We want to look</p>
<p>to somebody we&rsquo;re like, I trust you. If you&rsquo;re going to use a social media platform, I think you</p>
<p>have to trust the set of individuals working at the top of that social. Something I realized</p>
<p>really quickly, one of the lessons throughout the startup was that people don&rsquo;t totally connect to</p>
<p>products as much as they connect to people. And I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve spent on</p>
<p>Librex. You&rsquo;ve only been here the last week, but I mean, I love the product. And one of the aspects</p>
<p>of me loving the product is that I was super active and I&rsquo;ve been super active throughout the</p>
<p>entire time. And the amount of support I&rsquo;ve received has made that very easy to do from</p>
<p>the community and the fact that I could, I mean, so I came to Boston for this interview, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. I came to Boston. I got off the train. It was around 5.30 PM. I checked Librex. Someone</p>
<p>is writing, hey, I&rsquo;m in Boston. Does anyone want to get dinner? 30 minutes later, I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>dinner with them. That&rsquo;s amazing. And I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible. First of all, as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>the amount of stuff I learn from these people and when they reiterate and I hear that they got the</p>
<p>message through the product. I mean, that&rsquo;s incredibly validating, but also, I mean, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just important to be able to put a face to a brand and especially a brand that&rsquo;s built on trust</p>
<p>because fundamentally the users are trusting us with some really important discussions and some</p>
<p>really, and a movement to some degree. It&rsquo;s a community and a movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you actually why I didn&rsquo;t use the app very much so far is there&rsquo;s something really</p>
<p>powerful about the way it&rsquo;s constructed, which I felt like a bit of an outsider, because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the communities. It felt like it&rsquo;s a really strong community around each of these places.</p>
<p>And so I felt like I was, it made me really wish there was an MIT one. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>both discussions about the deep community issues within Columbia or Yale or so on,</p>
<p>and Dartmouth, and there&rsquo;s also the broader community of the Ivy Leagues that people are</p>
<p>discussing. But I could see that actually expanding more and more and more, but which is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a powerful coupling, which is the feeling of like this little village, this little community</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building together, but also the broader issues. So you could do both discussions.</p>
<p>One thing that was important to me is talking about social media as a concept. I think the way</p>
<p>people socialize is very much context dependent. So we&rsquo;re talking about people understanding each</p>
<p>other through language, through English. And these languages are constructed in a very nuanced way,</p>
<p>in a very sort of temperamental way, right? And you kind of need a similar context to be able to</p>
<p>have productive conversations. So to me, it&rsquo;s really important that these groups, they share</p>
<p>something in common, a really big lived experience, the Ivy League, or their school community. And</p>
<p>they have a similar vocabulary, they have a similar background, they know what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in their community. And so having social media that is community connected to me was fundamental.</p>
<p>Like, you talk about anonymity. To me, community is the thing that when I think about Librex,</p>
<p>I think what makes it different. It&rsquo;s the fact that everyone knows what&rsquo;s going on. Everyone</p>
<p>comes from a similar context and people can socialize in a way where they understand each</p>
<p>other because they&rsquo;ve been through, you used the word lived experience, they&rsquo;ve been through so</p>
<p>many of the same lived experiences.</p>
<p>One clarification, is there an easy way, if you choose, to then connect in meat space,</p>
<p>in physical space?</p>
<p>So the, I guess the sort of magic of it, and I was talking to a bunch of Harvard Librexers who I</p>
<p>met off the app while I was in Boston. And every time they told me this is my favorite part of the</p>
<p>app, this is what I love about the app. We have this matching system, which is an anonymous direct</p>
<p>message that you can send to any poster. So, like, I was talking to this guy who, he was really</p>
<p>into coin collection. And he met other people who are really into coin collection through a post</p>
<p>and what they he would make a post about coin collection. And then someone would come to him</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be like, and they could direct message him anonymously. And it would just show them that</p>
<p>his it would just show him their school. And then they could just text chat, totally anonymously,</p>
<p>direct message if he accepted the anonymous request.</p>
<p>Do they see the usernames, right?</p>
<p>There are no usernames on Librex. It&rsquo;s all just school&rsquo;s names. So he made this post about coin</p>
<p>collection. And he got a direct message.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so, right?</p>
<p>No usernames.</p>
<p>I was just looking at the text.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, I can go into why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can go into it.</p>
<p>So it truly is anonymous.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it depends on what you mean by anonymous.</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s a very different kind of anonymous.</p>
<p>And the reason that we made that decision is because we wanted people to connect to ideas.</p>
<p>We want people to connect to things in the moment. We don&rsquo;t want people to go,</p>
<p>oh, I know this guy. He said this other thing. And we didn&rsquo;t want people to feel like they were at</p>
<p>risk of being doxxed. So it&rsquo;s just these are small communities, right? We talked about this. Everyone</p>
<p>knows someone who knows you. And in 2021, it would not take much to be able to figure out who someone</p>
<p>might be just through a couple of posts. So it&rsquo;s both safety and about the ideas in terms of not</p>
<p>adding usernames. Anyway, we have this anonymous direct message system where you can direct</p>
<p>message the original poster of any post, the OP, if you&rsquo;re a Redditor, of any post. And that makes</p>
<p>it really easy to meet up because once you guys are one on one, you can exchange a number. You</p>
<p>can exchange a Snapchat. You can exchange an email. Probably not very often, but you could.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s how people meet up. Matching.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people connect in this way. Let me just take a small step into the technical.</p>
<p>I read somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true, that one of the reasons you were rejected from YC,</p>
<p>Y Combinator, in the final rounds is because one of the principles is to refuse to sell user data.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that? Why do you think it&rsquo;s important not to sell user data?</p>
<p>Which draws a clear contrast between other, basically any other service on the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, to be honest, it&rsquo;s quite simple. I mean, we talk about this platform. People are talking</p>
<p>about their most intimate secrets, their political opinions. How are they feeling about what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on in their city during the summer? How are they feeling about the political cycle and also their</p>
<p>mental health, their relationships? These are some of the most intimate thoughts that people</p>
<p>were having. Point blank, I don&rsquo;t think it was ethical to pawn them off for a profit.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was moral. I don&rsquo;t think I could sleep at night if that was what I was doing,</p>
<p>is turning these people&rsquo;s most intimate beliefs and secrets into a currency that I bought and sold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very off about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to believe that there is some room, so like Facebook would just take that data and</p>
<p>sell it, right? But there&rsquo;s some room in transparency and giving people the choice</p>
<p>on which parts they can, I wouldn&rsquo;t even see it as sell, but like share with advertisers.</p>
<p>Are you going to give them a profit?</p>
<p>So right, you have to monetize, you have to create an entire system, you have to rethink</p>
<p>this whole thing, right? But as long as you give people control and are transparent and make it</p>
<p>easy, like I think it&rsquo;s really difficult to delete a Facebook account or like delete all your data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>So like just make it easy and trust in that if you create a great product,</p>
<p>people are not going to do it. And if they do it, then they&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>a deep loving member of the community. What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>So we very quickly realized that user privacy was something that was not only a core value,</p>
<p>but was something that users really cared about. And we added this functionality. It&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>button that says, forget me. You press it, like two clicks. It&rsquo;s not that hard. We just</p>
<p>remove your email from the database. You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Beautiful. I think Facebook should have that. I honestly, so call me crazy, but maybe you can</p>
<p>actually speak to this, but I don&rsquo;t think Facebook, well now they would, but if they</p>
<p>did it earlier, they would lose that much money. If they allow like transparently tell people,</p>
<p>you could just delete everything. They also explained that like in ways that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>potentially like lessen your experience in the short term, like explain that. But then there</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be like multiple clicks of a button that don&rsquo;t make any sense. I&rsquo;m trying to hold</p>
<p>back from ranting about Instagram because let me just say real quick, because I&rsquo;ve been locked</p>
<p>out of Instagram for a month. And there&rsquo;s a whole group inside Facebook that are like supporters of</p>
<p>like Lex, help Lex. Free Lex? Free Lex. I wasn&rsquo;t blocked. It was just like a bug in the system.</p>
<p>Somebody was hammering the API with my account. And so they kept thinking I&rsquo;m a bot. Anyway,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bug. It happens to a lot of people, but like, first of all, I appreciate the love from</p>
<p>all the amazing engineers in Instagram and Facebook. All of those folks, the entire mechanism</p>
<p>though is somehow broken. I mean, I put that on the leadership, but it&rsquo;s also difficult to operate</p>
<p>a large company once it scales, all those kinds of things, but it should not be that difficult</p>
<p>to do some basic, basic things that you want to do, which is in the case of Facebook,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s verify your identity to the app. And also in the case of Facebook, in the case of Librex,</p>
<p>like disappear if you choose. There&rsquo;s downsides to disappearing, but it should not be a difficult</p>
<p>process. And yeah, I think people are waking up to that. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of room for an app</p>
<p>like Librex with its foundational ideas to redefine what social media should look like.</p>
<p>You know, and like you said, I think beautifully, anonymity is not the core value. It&rsquo;s just a tool</p>
<p>you use. And who knows, maybe anonymity will not always be the tool you use. Like if you give</p>
<p>people the choice, who knows what this evolves from the login page you initially created.</p>
<p>The key thing is the founding principles. And again, who knows if you give people a really</p>
<p>nice way to monetize their data, maybe there&rsquo;ll no longer be a thing that you say, do not sell</p>
<p>user data. Yeah, all those kinds of things. But the basic principles should be there. And also</p>
<p>a good, simple interface design goes a really long way. Like simplicity and elegance, which</p>
<p>Librex currently is. Clubhouse is another app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten a lot better, by the way. I don&rsquo;t mean to go too deep into the history, but the&hellip;</p>
<p>It was bad? I didn&rsquo;t look at the early pictures.</p>
<p>Oh, thank goodness.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that it was like a white screen, like with black.</p>
<p>The up and down buttons were like these big freaking boxes. And I could go on, but it was</p>
<p>my genius design skills. I almost failed art class when I was in first grade. And I think</p>
<p>I still have similar skills to my first grade self, but it&rsquo;s gotten a lot better. And thanks</p>
<p>to a lot of my friends who have sort of chipped in here and there.</p>
<p>Oh, I love the idea of a button that just forget me. I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s really moving,</p>
<p>actually. That&rsquo;s actually all people want, is they want, I think&hellip; Okay, I&rsquo;ll speak</p>
<p>to my experience. I would give so much more if I could just disappear if I needed to.</p>
<p>And I trusted the community. I trusted the founders and the principals. That&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>powerful, man. The trust and ease of escape. Yeah. You&rsquo;ve also kind of mentioned moderation,</p>
<p>which is really interesting. So with this anonymity and this community, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve heard of the internet, but there&rsquo;s trolls on the internet.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>And even if they go to Yale and Dartmouth, there&rsquo;s still people that probably enjoy</p>
<p>sort of being the guerrilla warfare, counter revolutionary, and just like creating chaos</p>
<p>in a place of love. So how do you prevent chaos and hatred breaking out in Librex?</p>
<p>So the way I think about it is we have these principals. They&rsquo;re pretty simple and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty easy to enforce. And then beyond the principals, we have a set of moderators,</p>
<p>moderate from every single Ivy League school, a team of diverse moderators who enforce these</p>
<p>principals, but not only enforce the principals, but kind of clue us in to what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in their community and how the real life context of their community translates to the Librex</p>
<p>context of their community. And beyond that, we have conversation with them about the</p>
<p>standards of the community. And we&rsquo;re constantly talking about what needs to be further</p>
<p>elucidated and what needs to be tweaked. And we&rsquo;re in constant communication with the</p>
<p>community. Now, if you want me to get into the principals that underlie Librex&rsquo;s moderation</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>Yeah, please. Maybe you can explain that there&rsquo;s moderators. What does that mean? How</p>
<p>are they chosen? And what are the principals under which they operate?</p>
<p>Sure. So how are the moderators chosen? The moderators are all volunteers. They&rsquo;re Librexers</p>
<p>who reach out to me and respond to the opportunity to become moderator. And the way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>chosen is basically we want to make sure that they&rsquo;re in tune with their community. We want</p>
<p>to make sure they come from diverse backgrounds and we want to make sure that they sort of</p>
<p>understand what the community is about. And then we ask them some questions about how</p>
<p>they would deal with certain scenarios, ones that we&rsquo;ve had in the past and we feel strongly</p>
<p>about. And then also ones that are a little more murky, where we want to see that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of thinking about these things in a critical way. And from there, we choose a set and they</p>
<p>have the power to take down posts. Of course, everything at the end of the day pens my</p>
<p>review, but they can take them down and we can reinstate them if it&rsquo;s a problem. But</p>
<p>they can take down posts and they can advocate for different moderation standards and different</p>
<p>moderation policies.</p>
<p>So for now, you&rsquo;re the Linus Torvalds of this community. So meaning like you&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>like people are actually able to like email you or like text you, contact you and get</p>
<p>a response. Like you respond to basically everybody. And then you&rsquo;re like really, you</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re living that live on people&rsquo;s floor life currently. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily, this is the early days folks. I knew Ryan before he was a billionaire and</p>
<p>he was cool. And then he was in a mansion making meats on his barbecue. No. Okay. But</p>
<p>you know, how does it scale? Like what I suppose, how does it scale is the question. I</p>
<p>mean, with Linus, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with the Linux open source community,</p>
<p>but he still stayed at the top for a while. It was really important. Like leadership there</p>
<p>was really important to drive that large scale, really productive open source community.</p>
<p>What do you see your role as Librex grows and in general, what are the mechanisms of</p>
<p>scaling here for moderation?</p>
<p>Where I see it, open discourse is fundamental to the purpose of the app, right? So as the,</p>
<p>I guess you could say founder, CEO, what have you, part of my purpose has to be to enforce</p>
<p>the vision, right? And part of the vision is open discourse. And that does come down</p>
<p>in part to reasonable moderation and community guided reasonable moderation. So I imagine</p>
<p>that will always be something that I&rsquo;m intimately involved with to some degree. Now the</p>
<p>degree to which the way in which that manifests, I imagine will have to change, right? And</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to, just like you can hire a CTO, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to be</p>
<p>in integrated in hiring people who understand the way that we are sort of operating and</p>
<p>the reasonable standards of moderation. And there can be a sort of hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>But I think when you have a product whose key purpose is to allow people to have these</p>
<p>difficult conversations on campus that need to be had, I can never fully, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I can fully ever abdicate that responsibility. I think that would be like, I mean, that would</p>
<p>be like Bezos abdicating eCommerce, right? That&rsquo;s part of the job.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course you can run companies in different ways. I think because he might have</p>
<p>abdicated quite a bit of the details there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to say.</p>
<p>Because Amazon does so many things. I think probably the better examples like Elon with</p>
<p>rockets, he&rsquo;s still at the core of the engineering. He&rsquo;s at the core of the engineering. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some fundamental questions. He probably does way too much of the engineering. He&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>lowest level detail. But you&rsquo;re saying the core things that make the app work is the</p>
<p>moderation of difficult conversations.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m 21 years old. Let&rsquo;s remind everyone of that. If this thing does scale</p>
<p>and if this thing continues to be a positive force in a lot of people&rsquo;s lives, who knows</p>
<p>what will happen in the next, what I&rsquo;ll learn. I&rsquo;m still growing definitely as a leader,</p>
<p>still growing as a thinker, still growing as a person. I can&rsquo;t pretend that I know how</p>
<p>to run a business that is worth up to $1 billion, whatever. I can&rsquo;t pretend I know how to run</p>
<p>a business that&rsquo;s going to have millions and millions of users. I expect that there are</p>
<p>going to be a lot of amazing people who will teach me and that a lot of people who have</p>
<p>already kind of stepped into my life and helped me out and taught me things. And I imagine</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll learn so much more. I just know that moderation is always going to be important</p>
<p>to me because I don&rsquo;t think Librex is Librex unless we have open discourse and moderation,</p>
<p>reasonable, open, light touch moderation is at the heart of creating that, right?</p>
<p>So as a creator of this kind of community in place with anonymity and difficult conversations,</p>
<p>what do you think about this touchy three words that people have been tossing around</p>
<p>and politicizing, I would say, but is at the core of the founding of this country, which</p>
<p>is the freedom of speech? How do you think about the freedom of speech, this particular</p>
<p>kind of freedom of expression? And do you think it&rsquo;s a fundamental human right? How</p>
<p>do you define it to yourself when you&rsquo;re thinking about it? I went down, especially</p>
<p>preparing for this conversation down a rabbit hole of like just how unclear it is philosophically</p>
<p>what is meant by this kind of freedom. It&rsquo;s not as easy as people think, but it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>pragmatically speaking to hear how you think about it in the context of Librex.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough one, right? There&rsquo;s a lot there. So I come from the background of being</p>
<p>a math major. Maybe it&rsquo;s important to start with that. And I found myself in the middle</p>
<p>of this question of freedom of speech. One of the wonderful things is that the Librex</p>
<p>community is filled with PhDs and governance majors who have taught me a ton about this</p>
<p>sort of thing. And I&rsquo;m still learning. I&rsquo;m still growing. I&rsquo;m still probably going to</p>
<p>modify my perspective to some degree. Hopefully. Don&rsquo;t worry. I imagine I&rsquo;ll always support</p>
<p>free discourse. Like learning how to speak about stuff is critical here because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning that this is like a minefield of conversations because the moment you say like</p>
<p>even saying freedom of speech is a complicated concept, people will be like, oh, we spotted</p>
<p>a communist. Like they&rsquo;ll say, there&rsquo;s nothing complicated about freedom. Freedom is freedom,</p>
<p>bro. It is complicated. First of all, if you talk about there&rsquo;s different definitions of freedom of</p>
<p>speech. If you want to go constitutionally, if you want to talk about the United States</p>
<p>specifically and what&rsquo;s legal, it&rsquo;s actually not as exciting and not as beautiful as what</p>
<p>people think of. It&rsquo;s complicated. I think there&rsquo;s ideals behind it that we want to see.</p>
<p>What does that actually materialize itself in the digital world where we&rsquo;re trying to communicate</p>
<p>in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn&rsquo;t result in the</p>
<p>silencing of voices, not through like censorship, but through like just assholes being rude.</p>
<p>Spam.</p>
<p>Spam. So it could be just bots.</p>
<p>Racism.</p>
<p>Racism.</p>
<p>Going back to the name of the app, Librex. Libre, free. X was put onto for free exchange</p>
<p>and the free exchange of what my purpose was to create as much inner communication of ideas,</p>
<p>be them repugnant or otherwise as possible. And of course, to do that within legal bounds</p>
<p>and to do that without causing anyone to be harassed or doxxed. So to keep things</p>
<p>focused on the ideas, not the people. And then no BS crap stuff. And so to me,</p>
<p>the easiest way to moderate around that, because as you said, figuring out what is hateful and what</p>
<p>is hate speech is really hard, was to say no sweeping statements against core identity groups.</p>
<p>And that seems to work on the whole pretty well to be pretty light touch.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to do though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>We like to generalize, we humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, but what it comes down to is be specific.</p>
<p>And when you think about what are sweeping statements against core identity groups,</p>
<p>oftentimes these are sort of hackneyed subjects. These are things that have been broached and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve heard them before. They don&rsquo;t really lead anywhere productive. So it goes under</p>
<p>this principle of be specific in the ideas you&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>So even for like positive and humorous stuff, you try to avoid generalizations.</p>
<p>Against core identity groups.</p>
<p>Core identity groups. Sorry, what are core identity groups?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking, kind of like,</p>
<p>You know, race, religion.</p>
<p>Okay. Got it. Even positive stuff?</p>
<p>Well, against, negative.</p>
<p>Oh, against. Sorry, against, against. Okay.</p>
<p>Very, very, we&rsquo;ve learned to be very specific. Very few words, but the community gets it, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, they get it. I mean, this is the thing. The trouble with rules is as the community grows,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll figure out ways to manipulate the rules.</p>
<p>Absolutely. It&rsquo;s human nature. It&rsquo;s creativity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something beautiful about it, of course.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fact that people are so creative and so looking to,</p>
<p>because people are genuinely interested in figuring out these things about social media.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll 100% see like, where&rsquo;s the edge? And I mean, part of that&rsquo;s maintaining some level</p>
<p>of vagueness in your rule set, which has its own set of questions and something we could think about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not implying I have all the answers, but there is something really interesting about people</p>
<p>being so engaged that they&rsquo;re looking to figure out where are those edges and what does that mean?</p>
<p>What does that edge mean, you know?</p>
<p>Well, so one of the things I&rsquo;m kind of thinking about,</p>
<p>like from an individual user of Librex or an individual user of the internet,</p>
<p>I think about like that one person that is on Reddit saying hateful stuff or positive stuff,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter, or funny stuff. One of the things I think about is the trajectory of that individual</p>
<p>through life and how social media can help that person become the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean from like an Orwellian sense, like educate them properly or something.</p>
<p>I just mean like, we&rsquo;re all, I believe, we&rsquo;re all fundamentally good. And I also believe</p>
<p>we all have the capacity to do, to create some amazing stuff in this world,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s ideas or art or engineering, all those kinds of things, just to be amazing people.</p>
<p>And I kind of think about like, you know, a lot of social media mechanisms bring out the worst</p>
<p>in us. And I try to think like, in the long term, how can the social media or how can a website,</p>
<p>how can a tool that you create can make the best, like you take a trajectory that makes you better,</p>
<p>better and better and like the best version of yourself. So I think about that because like,</p>
<p>you know, Twitter can really take you down some dark trajectories. I&rsquo;ve seen people just not being</p>
<p>the best version of themselves. Forget the cancel culture and all that kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not developing intellectually in the way that&rsquo;s going to make the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>I think Reddit, I&rsquo;m not sure what I think about Reddit yet, because one positive side is all the</p>
<p>shit posting I read. It could be just like a release valve for some stress in life. And you</p>
<p>almost have like a parallel life where you&rsquo;re in meat space. You might be actually becoming</p>
<p>successful and so on and growing and so on, but you just need some times to be angry at somebody.</p>
<p>But I tend to not think that&rsquo;s possible. I think if you&rsquo;re shit posting, you&rsquo;re probably not</p>
<p>spending your time the best way you could. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m torn on that. But do you think</p>
<p>about that with Librex of creating a trajectory for the Yale, for the Dartmouth, for the students,</p>
<p>to where they grow intellectually?</p>
<p>One thing that I think about a lot is how do you incentivize positive content creation? How do you</p>
<p>incentivize really intellectual content creation? It&rsquo;s something that, frankly, I think about every</p>
<p>single day. And I think there are ways that&hellip; I mean, one thing that&rsquo;s great about humans is that</p>
<p>they can be incentivized, right? And I think there are ways that you can incentivize people to make</p>
<p>the right kind of content if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p>
<p>So you think such mechanisms exist for such incentivization?</p>
<p>I do. I don&rsquo;t want to let the cat out of the bag, so to speak.</p>
<p>Do you have already concrete ideas in your mind?</p>
<p>I have about three concrete ideas that I&rsquo;m very, very optimistic about.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to share them. I understand totally. But the fact that you have them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really good. Because I feel like sometimes the downfall of the social media is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally not even a thinking or a discussion about the incentivization of positive long term</p>
<p>content creation. Twitter, I really was excited about this when they said like,</p>
<p>when Jack has talked about creating healthy conversations.</p>
<p>He does seem to care. I&rsquo;ve listened to him. I mean, he has a very particular way of saying</p>
<p>things. But you get the impression that he&rsquo;s someone who actually cares about these things</p>
<p>within the limits of his power.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s the question, the limits of the power. Librex is growing not just in the number</p>
<p>of communities, but also in the way you&rsquo;re incentivizing positive conversations, like coupled</p>
<p>with a moderation and so on. So you think there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation to be had in that area?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount. I think when you think about the reasons people post,</p>
<p>fundamentally, people want to make a positive impact on their community to some degree. Now,</p>
<p>there will always be bad actors. And part of the benefit of our moderation structure is that we</p>
<p>can limit some of those bad actors, no bot accounts, no brigading. At the same time,</p>
<p>the more you incentivize a certain type of behavior, the better it&rsquo;s going to be. And we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see it as our role as the platform to force the community in a direction. And frankly, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it would be good for anyone, the community or the conversations, if we forced a specific type</p>
<p>of conversation. We just need to make the tools to allow people to be good and to incentivize good</p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe that. You will not need to censor if you allow people at scale to be good. The good</p>
<p>will overpower the assholes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my fundamental belief. I&rsquo;m very optimistic about that.</p>
<p>But currently, Librex is small in the sense that it&rsquo;s a small set of communities that I believe.</p>
<p>And you mentioned to me offline that by design, you&rsquo;re scaling slowly and carefully.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So how does Librex scale? Is it possible? Facebook also started with a small set of communities</p>
<p>that were schools, and then now grew to be basically the, if not one of the largest social</p>
<p>networks in the world. Do you see Librex as potentially scaling to be beyond even college</p>
<p>campuses, but encompassing the whole world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long timeline. I&rsquo;ll say this. This gets back to where did Facebook go wrong?</p>
<p>Because clearly, they did a lot right. And we can only speculate about what the objectives</p>
<p>were of the founders of Facebook. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve said some things, but it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>interesting to know what the mythology is versus what the truth is of the matter. So</p>
<p>perhaps they&rsquo;ve been very successful. I mean, they&rsquo;ve taken over the world to some extent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the goals of Librex are to create these positive communities and</p>
<p>these open conversations where people can have real conversation and connection in</p>
<p>their communities in a vulnerable and authentic way. And so to that end, which I imagine might</p>
<p>be different than the goals of a Facebook, for example, one thing that we want to do</p>
<p>is keep things intimate and community based. So each school is its own community. And perhaps</p>
<p>you could have a slightly broader community. Maybe you could have a, I know the California</p>
<p>system is an obvious one. Packed time might be an obvious one. And we can think about that. But</p>
<p>fundamentally, the unit of community is your school or your school community. So that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>difference that I think will help us. The other thing is that we&rsquo;re scaling intentionally, meaning</p>
<p>that when we expand to a school, we have moderators in place. We have moderators who understand that</p>
<p>school&rsquo;s environment in a very personal level. And we&rsquo;re growing responsibly. We&rsquo;re growing as we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready, both technologically, but also socially. But as we think we have the tools to preserve</p>
<p>the community and to encourage the community to create the sort of content that we want them to</p>
<p>create. And there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to define community. So first of all, there&rsquo;s geographic</p>
<p>community as well. But the way you&rsquo;re kind of defining community with Yale and Dartmouth is the</p>
<p>email, right? That&rsquo;s what gives you, there&rsquo;s a power to the email in the sense that that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you can verify, efficiently verify yourself with being a single individual in the university. In</p>
<p>that same way, you can verify your employment at a company, for example, like Google, Microsoft,</p>
<p>Facebook. Do you see potentially taking on those communities? That&rsquo;d be fascinating,</p>
<p>getting like anonymous community conversations inside Google.</p>
<p>100% crossed my mind. To some extent, this is something where I understand the college</p>
<p>experience. I understand the need. And I&rsquo;ve never worked at Google. I don&rsquo;t know if they would hire</p>
<p>me. Hopefully, maybe as a product manager. I think if there&rsquo;s a community that needs this product,</p>
<p>and has that will, which I think, especially as Librex continues to grow and expand and change</p>
<p>and learn. Because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re learning, right? With each community, it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about growing. It&rsquo;s about learning from each of these communities and iterating. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite likely there are going to be all sorts of communities that could use this tool to improve</p>
<p>their culture, so to speak. So forgive me, I&rsquo;m not actually that knowledgeable about the history of</p>
<p>attempts of building social networks to solve the problem that you&rsquo;re solving. But I was made aware</p>
<p>that there was an app or at least a social network called Yik Yak that had a similar kind of</p>
<p>focus. I think the thing you&rsquo;ve spoken about that differs between Librex and Yik Yak is that Yik Yak</p>
<p>was defined, am I pronouncing it right even? You good? I&rsquo;m good. I met the founder so I can confirm.</p>
<p>Okay, you can confirm, cool. That it was constrained to a geographical area versus like to the actual</p>
<p>community and that somehow had fundamental like actual differences in social dynamics that resulted.</p>
<p>But can you speak to the history of Yik Yak? Like how does Librex differ? What lessons have you learned</p>
<p>from that? Oh, and I should say that I guess there was controversial, I don&rsquo;t know, I didn&rsquo;t look at</p>
<p>the details, but I&rsquo;m guessing there&rsquo;s a bunch of racism and hate speech and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that emerged on Yik Yak. Okay, so that&rsquo;s an example of like, okay, here&rsquo;s how it goes wrong when you</p>
<p>have anonymity on college campuses. So how does Librex going to do better? Yeah, Yik Yak had a</p>
<p>lot of problems, content problems, but the content problems go deeper than maybe what the press would</p>
<p>reveal. There&rsquo;s a lot to say and part of it is parsing exactly what to talk about when it comes</p>
<p>to Yik Yak and when you talk about startups, I mean you know this, you know startups, and you</p>
<p>look at the postmortem, it&rsquo;s almost never what people think it is. And oftentimes these things</p>
<p>are somewhat unknowable and the degree to which people seeking confirmation bias to somebody,</p>
<p>seeking closure, look to find a singular attribute that caused the failure. It feels like the little</p>
<p>details often make all the difference. Yes, and I think the details are so little that as humans</p>
<p>we are not capable of parsing even what they are. But I&rsquo;ll tell you my perspective on it,</p>
<p>knowing that I am also a human with biases. In this particular case, very significant biases.</p>
<p>So I started building Librex for its own merits. At first I wasn&rsquo;t aware of Yik Yak, but as I started</p>
<p>to talk to people about this platform I was building, I was made aware of Yik Yak and I</p>
<p>built it from day one with a lot of the issues Yik Yak had in mind. So as you said, the one</p>
<p>difference between Yik Yak is the geographical versus community based aspect. Going along with</p>
<p>that, one thing I realized by researching social media sites is that the majority of</p>
<p>the negative content, the content that&rsquo;s terrible and breaking all the rules is created by really,</p>
<p>and the people who are not reformable, so to speak, the people who are not showing the best</p>
<p>part of the human experience. It&rsquo;s a really small minority, right? I remember, I was listening to</p>
<p>the founder of 4ChamMoot talk about this, how like one guy was able to basically destroy</p>
<p>like large swaths of his community. Yeah, that&rsquo;s part of what makes it exciting for that</p>
<p>minority is how much power they can have. So if you&rsquo;re predisposed to think in this way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exciting that you can walk into, like I mentioned the party before, you have a party</p>
<p>of a lot of positive people and it feels, especially if you don&rsquo;t have much power in this</p>
<p>world, it feels exceptionally empowering to just, to destroy like the lives of many.</p>
<p>Yeah. And if you think this way, it&rsquo;s a problem. But I&rsquo;m hopeful that you&rsquo;re right, that in most</p>
<p>cases it&rsquo;s going to be a minority of people. I think it is. And that&rsquo;s what the research has</p>
<p>showed. And one really powerful thing is that we can really actively control who comes in and out</p>
<p>of our community based on the.edu verification. And we can also control who&rsquo;s not in our community</p>
<p>because we have that lever where each account is associated with a.edu. So that&rsquo;s the first point</p>
<p>I would point out there. Second point is controlled expansion, meaning that we have community</p>
<p>moderation. We have this panel that allows the moderators to see all of the highly downloaded</p>
<p>content, all of the reported content, all the flagged content and look through it and decide</p>
<p>what they like and what&rsquo;s appropriate and what&rsquo;s not appropriate. And we have, we ping every</p>
<p>moderator when there&rsquo;s a report. So things are taken down pretty quickly. And we have our</p>
<p>standards and we have, I think above all of that, we have a mission and it&rsquo;s a community based</p>
<p>mission. Yik Yak was more of a fun app and by its own admission, it was a place where people could</p>
<p>enjoy themselves and could sort of yak. Yik Yak, chit chat. We have a bigger purpose than that,</p>
<p>frankly. And I think that shows in the people who self select to be on that app, to be on Librex</p>
<p>and to be on Yik Yak, respectively. The last thing I&rsquo;ll say is Yik Yak was very few characters. It</p>
<p>was a Twitter esque platform. And that doesn&rsquo;t allow for a tremendous amount of nuance. It</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow for a tremendous amount of conversation. Librex is much more long form.</p>
<p>And so the kind of posts that you&rsquo;ll get on Librex can span pages. What people are starting</p>
<p>to realize is that they can reach a lot more people at a lot more pertinent of a time a lot</p>
<p>more quickly by posting their thoughts on Librex than if they went to their school newspaper.</p>
<p>And I think the school newspapers might be a little worried about that. But more importantly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re connecting people in this way where long form communication with nuance that takes into</p>
<p>account everything that&rsquo;s happening in the community temporally is really available at</p>
<p>Librex and not really communicable in 240 or 480 or whatever the number of characters the yaks were</p>
<p>bound to. And I could talk about the history of Yik Yak if you want me to go further. They started,</p>
<p>I think they were at 12 schools. And then spring break hit. People told their friends,</p>
<p>look at this app. A thousand schools signed up and had active communities. They had a problem</p>
<p>on their hands. And then the high schools come on board. I think a lot of the things you said</p>
<p>ring true to me, but especially the vision one, which I do think having a vision in the leadership,</p>
<p>having a mission makes all the difference in the world. That&rsquo;s both for the engineers that</p>
<p>are building, like the team that&rsquo;s building the app, the moderation and users because they kind of,</p>
<p>the mission carries itself through the behavior of the people on the social network.</p>
<p>As a small tangent, let me ask you something about Parler, but it&rsquo;s less about Parler,</p>
<p>more about AWS. So AWS removed Parler from his platform, you know, for whatever reasons,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. But the fact that AWS would do this was really, really bothered me</p>
<p>personally, because I saw AWS as the computing infrastructure and I always thought that part</p>
<p>could not put a finger on its scale. And I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are. Like,</p>
<p>were you bothered by Parler being removed from AWS? And how does that affect how you think about</p>
<p>the computing infrastructure on which Librex is based?</p>
<p>I was bothered not so much by Parler specifically being taken out of AWS, but more the fact that</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s like a highway, something that people rely on, that people build on top of, that</p>
<p>people assume is going to be somewhat position agnostic, like a road that people drive on, is</p>
<p>becoming ideologically sort of discriminatory. And of course, mind you, Amazon can do what it</p>
<p>wants. It&rsquo;s a private company and I support the rights of private companies. I just, on an ethical</p>
<p>and sort of a deep moral level, I wonder, like, at what point should a company sort of be agnostic</p>
<p>in that regard and let developers build on top of their infrastructure? And where does that</p>
<p>responsibility hold?</p>
<p>Yes, it makes you hope that there&rsquo;s going to be, from a capitalistic sense, competitors to AWS</p>
<p>would say, like, we&rsquo;re not going to put our finger on the scale. I mean, on the highway is a good</p>
<p>sort of example. It&rsquo;s like if a privately owned highway said, you know, we&rsquo;re no longer going to</p>
<p>allow, we&rsquo;re only going to allow electric vehicles. And a bunch of people in this world would be like,</p>
<p>yes, because electric is good for the environment. And, you know, I think that&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>You know, yes, but then you have to consider the, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also</p>
<p>like the negative impact on the lives of many others and what that means for innovation and for,</p>
<p>like, competition, again, in a capitalistic sense. So, there&rsquo;s some nature, there&rsquo;s some level to</p>
<p>this hierarchy of our existence that we should not allow to manipulate what&rsquo;s built on top of it. It</p>
<p>should be truly infrastructure. And it feels like compute is storage and compute is that layer. Like,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be messed with. I haven&rsquo;t seen anybody really complain about it, like, in terms</p>
<p>of government. And I&rsquo;m not even sure government is the right mechanism through policy and regulation</p>
<p>to step in. Because again, they do a messy job of fixing things. But I do hope there&rsquo;s competitors</p>
<p>to AWS to make AWS then step up. Because I do think, you know, I&rsquo;m a fan of AWS, except this.</p>
<p>Good service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good service until this.</p>
<p>Until, yeah, until they rip out the rug.</p>
<p>And the point is, it&rsquo;s not that necessarily their decision was a bad one with Parler,</p>
<p>in particular. It&rsquo;s that, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also</p>
<p>the, it takes the good actors that are creating amazing products and makes them more fearful.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re more fearful, it&rsquo;s the same reason that anonymity is a tool that you don&rsquo;t create</p>
<p>the best thing you could possibly create. When you&rsquo;re fearful, you don&rsquo;t create.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve kind of talked about it a little bit. But I wonder if we can kind of revisit it</p>
<p>a little bit. I talked to a guy named Ronald Sullivan, who&rsquo;s a faculty at Harvard, a law</p>
<p>professor. He was on the legal defense team. He was the lawyer for Harvey Weinstein and Aaron</p>
<p>Hernandez for the double murder case. So he takes on these really difficult cases of unpopular</p>
<p>figures because he believes like that&rsquo;s the way you test that we believe in the rule of law.</p>
<p>But he was, there&rsquo;s a big protest in Harvard to get him, basically censor him and to get him to</p>
<p>no longer be faculty dean, all those kinds of things. And it was by a minority of students, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge blowback, obviously in the public, but also inside Harvard, like that&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>He stands for the very principles at the founding of Harvard and at the principles of the founding</p>
<p>of this country and the law and so on. But the basic argument is that it was about safe spaces,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s unsafe to have somebody who is basically supporting Harvey Weinstein, right?</p>
<p>What do you think about this whole idea of safe spaces on college campuses? Because it feels like</p>
<p>the mission of Librex is pushing back against the idea of safe spaces.</p>
<p>I think safe spaces are fine when they&rsquo;re within people&rsquo;s private lives, within their homes,</p>
<p>within their religious organizations. I think the problem becomes when the institution starts</p>
<p>encouraging or backing safe spaces because what are people being safe from? And oftentimes,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s this idea that the harm that&rsquo;s being attempted to be mitigated is the</p>
<p>harm of confronting opinions you disagree with, opinions you might find repugnant.</p>
<p>And if this is conflated with a need for safety, then that&rsquo;s where the idea of liberal arts</p>
<p>education sort of dies. Of course, it&rsquo;s complicated and we still want to have safe</p>
<p>intellectual environments. But the way that I hear the term safe space used today,</p>
<p>I think it doesn&rsquo;t really have a place within the intellectual context.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny. I mean, this is why Librex is really exciting, is it&rsquo;s pushing those</p>
<p>difficult conversations. And I&rsquo;d love to see, ultimately, there does seem to be an asymmetry</p>
<p>of power that results in the concept of safe spaces and hate speech being redefined in the</p>
<p>slippery slope kind of way where it means basically anything you want it to mean. And</p>
<p>it basically is used to silence people, to silence people. They&rsquo;re like good, thoughtful experts.</p>
<p>Also, beyond that, I would say it has not just a pragmatic purpose, which is the silencing,</p>
<p>but also sort of an ideological purpose, which is, and a linguistic purpose, which is to</p>
<p>conflate words with unsafety and harm and violence, which is what you kind of see on a</p>
<p>cultural linguistic level is happening all around us right now is that this idea that words are harm</p>
<p>is a very dangerous and slippery concept. I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to slip that far to see</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s a problem. Once we start making words into violence and we start criminalizing words,</p>
<p>we get into some really authoritarian territory, things that I think, I mean, myself and my</p>
<p>background, I don&rsquo;t know how much we have to go into it, but things that my ancestors</p>
<p>certainly would be worried about. What&rsquo;s your background?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a child of Holocaust survivors and pro grom survivors, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, me as well from different directions. I come from the Soviet Union, so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, well, like in most of us, hate and love runs through our blood from our history.</p>
<p>You mentioned MIT is being added to Librex. Has it already been added?</p>
<p>Yes, it was added today.</p>
<p>Today, okay. So let me ask you, this is exciting because I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are about</p>
<p>this, but I&rsquo;ll tell you from my perspective, if you&rsquo;re, and a lot of MIT folks listen to this,</p>
<p>I would love it if you joined Librex. It&rsquo;d be interesting to explore conversations</p>
<p>on several topics inside MIT, but one of the most moving that hasn&rsquo;t been discussed at all</p>
<p>at all, except in little flourishes here and there, is the topic of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s been a huge amount of, like, impact that the connections of various faculty to Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein and the various things that have been said had on MIT, but it feels like the difficult</p>
<p>conversation haven&rsquo;t had been had. It&rsquo;s the administration trying to clean up and give a bunch</p>
<p>of BS to try to pretend, like, let&rsquo;s just hide this part. Like nothing is broken, nothing to see</p>
<p>here. Here&rsquo;s a bad dude that did some bad things and some faculty that kind of misbehaved a little</p>
<p>bit because they&rsquo;re a little bit clueless. Let&rsquo;s all look the other way. Harvard did this much</p>
<p>better, by the way. They completely, it&rsquo;s almost like people pretend like Harvard didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein. But I think I&rsquo;d be curious to hear what those conversations</p>
<p>are because there&rsquo;s conversations on the topic of like, well, obviously sort of sexual assault and</p>
<p>disrespecting women on any kind of level within academia, but just women in general.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important topic to talk about, various, many sets of difficult conversations. And the</p>
<p>other topic is, you know, funding for research. Like how are, like, what are we okay taking money</p>
<p>from and what are we not okay taking money from? You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of just interesting</p>
<p>difficult conversations to be had. I&rsquo;ve worked with people who, you know, refuse to take money</p>
<p>from DOD, Department of Defense, for example, because in some indirect or direct way, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funding military industrial complex, all those kinds of things. I think with Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more stark, this contrast of like, well, what is and isn&rsquo;t ethical to take money from?</p>
<p>And I just think, forget academia, I think there&rsquo;s just a lot of interesting, deep human</p>
<p>discussions to be had. And they haven&rsquo;t been. And there&rsquo;s been somebody, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with Eric Weinstein, who has been outraged by the fact that nobody&rsquo;s talking about Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein. Nobody&rsquo;s having these difficult conversations. And Eric himself has had a sort of</p>
<p>complicated journey through academia, in the sense that he&rsquo;s a really kind of renegade thinker in</p>
<p>many kinds of ways. I&rsquo;m not sure if you know who Eric is, by any chance. Heard the name. Okay. I</p>
<p>actually checked out ZEV. ZEV. It was heartening for me to see that I was not the youngest person</p>
<p>on this podcast. You&rsquo;re the second youngest. Second youngest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious. But Eric, he&rsquo;s kind of a renegade thinker. He&rsquo;s a mathematical physicist</p>
<p>with, I believe, a PhD at Harvard, and he spent some time at MIT and so on. But he speaks to the</p>
<p>fact that there&rsquo;s a culture of conformity and so on. And if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s a bit outside of</p>
<p>the box, a bit weird, in whatever dimension of weird, that makes you actually kind of interesting</p>
<p>that the system kind of wants to make you an outcast, wants to throw you out. And so he kind</p>
<p>of opposes that whole idea. He&rsquo;s the perfect person to have conversations with in this kind</p>
<p>of Librex kind of context of anonymity. Because I&rsquo;ll tell you the few conversations that came across</p>
<p>and they were very quickly silenced. And I&rsquo;m troubled by it. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think of it.</p>
<p>Is there&rsquo;s a few threads inside MIT, like on a mailing list, discussing Marvin Minsky. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you know who that is. He&rsquo;s an AI researcher. He&rsquo;s a seminal figure in AI before your time, but</p>
<p>one of the most important people in the history of artificial intelligence. And there was a</p>
<p>discussion on a thread that involved the interaction between Marvin Minsky and Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>That conversation was quickly shut down. One person was pushed out of MIT, Richard Stallman,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the key figures in the, because of that, because he wanted some clarity about the</p>
<p>situation. But he also miss, he spoke, like we mentioned earlier, without grace, right?</p>
<p>But he was quickly punished by the administration because of a few people protesting. And just that</p>
<p>conversation, I guess what bothered me most is it didn&rsquo;t continue. It didn&rsquo;t expand. There was no</p>
<p>like complexity. And it was, there was a hunger that was clear behind that conversation, especially</p>
<p>sort of for me, I&rsquo;d like to understand Marvin Minsky was one of the reasons I wanted to come</p>
<p>to MIT. He&rsquo;s passed away, but he&rsquo;s one of the key figures in the field that I deeply care about,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. And I thought that his name was dragged through the mud,</p>
<p>through that situation, and without ever being like resolved. And so it&rsquo;s unclear to me, like,</p>
<p>what am I supposed to think about all this? And the only way to come to a conclusion there is to</p>
<p>keep talking. It&rsquo;s like the thing we started this conversation with about truth is like,</p>
<p>is conversation. So in that sense, I&rsquo;d love if people on Librex, perhaps in other places,</p>
<p>but it seems like Librex is a nice platform to discuss Marvin Minsky, to discuss Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>to learn from it, to grow from it, to see how we can make MIT better. As I&rsquo;m still one of the</p>
<p>people, I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of being at MIT and it was a dream come true in many ways. And I still</p>
<p>believe that MIT is one of the most special places in this world. Like many other universities,</p>
<p>universities in general is truly special, man. It hurts my heart when people speak poorly of</p>
<p>academia. I understand what they mean. They&rsquo;re very correct, but there is much more, in my opinion,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful about academia than that&rsquo;s broken. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you have something to</p>
<p>comment. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be about Jeffrey Epstein, but there&rsquo;s these difficult things</p>
<p>that come up that test the academic community, right? That it feels like conversation is the</p>
<p>only way to resolve it. I think people have a natural need for closure. And it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as plugged into the, what academics are talking about as you would be Lux, but I even&hellip;</p>
<p>In case these days, no respect for Minsky. Exactly. I mean, especially in the AI community,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily a programmer. But what I will say is that people come to Librex and</p>
<p>we always see a huge spike in users whenever there&rsquo;s a tragedy on campus or something where</p>
<p>people need closure. Recently, there was a suicide just the other day on Yale&rsquo;s campus,</p>
<p>and people were just coming to pay respects and to say, rest in peace, and speak also about</p>
<p>what might&rsquo;ve led to an environment where people are drawn to these terrible results.</p>
<p>So just having a conversation is important there, because it brings closure.</p>
<p>People need the space, especially when no one wants to go out and put their head above,</p>
<p>be the longest blade of grass on that one because of the stigma. People need to be able to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, that fear really bothers me, the fear that silences people. Like, were they self censor? Were</p>
<p>they self silence? Well, you&rsquo;ve created an amazing place. I&rsquo;m kind of interested in your struggle and</p>
<p>your journey of creating positive incentives, because it&rsquo;s a problem in a very different domain</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m also interested in. So I love robotics. I love human robot interaction. And so I believe</p>
<p>that most people are good and we can bring out the best in human nature. Social networks is a very</p>
<p>tricky space to do that in. So I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re taking on the problem and I&rsquo;m glad you have the</p>
<p>mission that you do. I hope you succeed. But you mentioned offline that you used to be into chess.</p>
<p>Tell me about your journey through chess. Sure. I was a very competitive tournament player growing</p>
<p>up till about like 13. I got for the chess fans, I got to around 2000. USCF. So I was a competitive</p>
<p>player, especially my age group. And that actually led me to poker. I was I was playing a tournament.</p>
<p>And what happens is when you&rsquo;re like a very strong 13 year old and you&rsquo;re playing locally,</p>
<p>if you want a good match, you&rsquo;re gonna end up playing a lot of adults and you&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>playing if you want a good match, you&rsquo;re gonna end up playing a lot of adults. And I ended up</p>
<p>playing this mid 40s guy who we played a really strong game. He actually beat me. I still I still</p>
<p>remember the game and think I could I should have played that move instead of that one. But after</p>
<p>after the game, we had a postmortem. It was this me I think I was 13 at the time and this 40 year</p>
<p>old like hanging over this chessboard and looking over the moves. And even at that even at my age,</p>
<p>that this guy was absolutely brilliant. Yes. And after after the postmortem, not only by the way,</p>
<p>in chess, but just like in the way he articulates his thoughts, as some people are. After postmortem,</p>
<p>I went and looked him up online, I found out that he was a World Series of Poker Champion.</p>
<p>And his name is Bill Chen. Oh, wow. And I haven&rsquo;t really kept up with him, except one time there</p>
<p>was another chess tournament when I was around 14. And I followed him into an elevator as he was</p>
<p>leaving the chess hall, like pretending that I was going to go up just because I wanted to,</p>
<p>I just wanted to talk to him. And I suggested a sequel or some changes that he could that I</p>
<p>thought he could make for his book. And he was like, actually, I was thinking of doing the same</p>
<p>thing, which is incredibly validating to my 14 year old or 15 year old self. But I really haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kept up with him. So shout out to him. But and then that he wrote a book called the mathematics</p>
<p>of poker that I started reading. And that, first of all, kickstarted my interest in game theory.</p>
<p>And second of all, in poker. So it started from chess and then poker. And I started with Bitcoin</p>
<p>poker and had a lot of success with that met a lot of amazing friends. Learned a ton about I mean,</p>
<p>I think about entrepreneurship as well as taking risks, reasonable risks, positive expected value</p>
<p>risks. And also just growing as a person and mathematician. And what did you say Bitcoin</p>
<p>poker? Yeah, what&rsquo;s Bitcoin poker? So you have to understand I was 14 years old, right? Yes. So how</p>
<p>is a 14 year old with wonderful parents who care about him? Yeah. And probably don&rsquo;t want him</p>
<p>playing poker. Yeah. Going to start playing poker, because I wanted I wanted to challenge I love the</p>
<p>challenge of the competition. And I realized the answer is probably Bitcoin. Because the implications</p>
<p>of that. And they had they had these free roll tournaments, which for those who don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>free rolls are, there&rsquo;s these promotional tournaments that sites put on where they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put like a few dollars in and then 1000s of people sign up and the winners get like a dollar.</p>
<p>And I started there and I worked my way up. And that&rsquo;s amazing. What&rsquo;s your sense about from that</p>
<p>time to today of the growth of the cryptocurrency community? I&rsquo;m actually having like four or five</p>
<p>conversations with Bitcoin proponents, Bitcoin maximalists, and like all these I&rsquo;m just having</p>
<p>all these cryptocurrency conversations currently, because there&rsquo;s so many brilliant, like technically</p>
<p>brilliant, but also financially and philosophically brilliant people in those communities. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating with the explosion of impact, like and also, if you look into the future, the possible</p>
<p>revolutionary impact on society in general, but what&rsquo;s your sense about this whole growth of</p>
<p>Bitcoin? I&rsquo;m definitely less knowledgeable on the currency. Again, like programming, it was a means</p>
<p>to an end. Yes. Right. What I will say is that there was this amazing community that grew out of</p>
<p>it. And you&rsquo;d have people who were willing to stake me or have me be their horse and they&rsquo;re my</p>
<p>backer. For having never met me for literally full Bitcoin tournaments, like full Bitcoin entry fee</p>
<p>tournaments, and I get a percentage of the profits and they get a percentage. And to have that level</p>
<p>of community for that degree of money, I mean, it gives you hope about the potential for, you know,</p>
<p>humans to act in mutual best interest with a degree of trust. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a really fascinating,</p>
<p>strong community there. But speaking of like bringing out the best of human nature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a community that&rsquo;s currently struggling a little bit in terms of their ability to communicate</p>
<p>in a positive, inspiring way. Like the Bitcoin folks, and we talk about this a lot. I honestly</p>
<p>think they have a lot of love in their hearts and minds, but they just kind of naturally,</p>
<p>naturally, because the world has been like institutions and the centralized powers have been</p>
<p>sort of mocking and fighting them for many years that they&rsquo;ve become sort of worn down and cynical.</p>
<p>And so they tend to be a little bit more aggressive and negative on the internet in the</p>
<p>way they communicate, especially on Twitter. And it&rsquo;s just created this whole community of</p>
<p>of basically being derisive and mocking and trolling and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But people are trying to, you know, as the Bitcoin community grows, as the cryptocurrency community</p>
<p>grows, they&rsquo;re trying to revolutionize that aspect too. So they&rsquo;re trying to find the positive core</p>
<p>and grow and grow in that way. So it&rsquo;s fascinating because I think all of us are trying to find the</p>
<p>positive aspects of ourselves and trying to learn how to communicate in a positive way online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the internet hasn&rsquo;t been around. Social networks haven&rsquo;t been around that long. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to figure this thing out. Let me ask you the ridiculous question. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>have an answer, but who is the greatest chess player of all time in your view? So since you</p>
<p>like chess. That&rsquo;s how you define it. But if you&rsquo;re talking about raw skill, like if you put everyone</p>
<p>across time into a torment together, Carlson would win. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s particularly</p>
<p>controversial. Oh, you mean like with the same exact skill level? Exactly. Now if you talk about</p>
<p>political importance, I think Bobby Fischer is, you know, he&rsquo;s the only one that people still,</p>
<p>when you go to someone on the street, they know Bobby Fischer because of what he represented,</p>
<p>right? Who do you think is more famous on the street? Garry Kasparov or Bobby Fischer?</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer. In America, Bobby Fischer. You think so? Yes. That&rsquo;s interesting. I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to put that to the test. Yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s more reflective of the community that I was</p>
<p>a part of, but yeah. Oh, so in the community you&rsquo;re a part of like Young Minds playing chess,</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer was a superstar in terms of the roots. Yeah, I think so because he&rsquo;s American</p>
<p>and, you know, he stood up against the big bad Russians at the time and, you know, unfortunately</p>
<p>he had a very bad downfall. But, you know, for our geopolitical situation, he meant a lot. And then</p>
<p>if you talk about compared to contemporaries, actually, I would say Paul Morphy was a bit of</p>
<p>a throwback. He&rsquo;s one of those geniuses that was just head and shoulders above everyone else.</p>
<p>Is there somebody that inspired your own play, like as a Young Mind? Yeah, I really liked</p>
<p>Mikhail Tal. I think he was very aggressive, right? Yeah, very tactical. Which is funny because I</p>
<p>found that I was better at like sort of slow methodical play than quick tactics, but I just,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something beautiful about the creativity and that&rsquo;s something I always latched</p>
<p>onto as being a creative player, being a creative person. I mean, chess doesn&rsquo;t really reward</p>
<p>creativity as much as a lot of other things, especially entrepreneurial pursuits, which I</p>
<p>think is part of the reason why I sort of grew out of it. But I always was attracted to the</p>
<p>creativity that I did see in chess. So let me ask the flip, the other, because you said poker,</p>
<p>is there somebody that stands out to you as could be the greatest poker player of all time? Like</p>
<p>who do you admire? That&rsquo;s a more controversial one because these chess players are such like,</p>
<p>first of all, there&rsquo;s more an objective standard. And second of all, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like almost like cultural figures to me. Whereas poker players are more like live,</p>
<p>living. They feel more like, yeah, they feel more accessible. But they also have like</p>
<p>personalities in poker. They have vices, they have quirks, they have humor. Like,</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ve seen videos of them because it&rsquo;s such a recent development. I&rsquo;ll say one person</p>
<p>who I admire so much. And like, if I could like have a dinner list of people that I want to have</p>
<p>dinner with, like maybe it&rsquo;ll happen now, actually. I would love to have dinner with him. Phil</p>
<p>Galfond, who most people probably won&rsquo;t know. But on this podcast, but the way, first of all,</p>
<p>he democratized poker learning in like the mathematical nitty gritty, how do you get good</p>
<p>at poker type sense to the entire world in like an unprecedented way. He gave, he had this gift</p>
<p>that he had learned and distilled by working with some of the greatest poker minds. And he</p>
<p>just democratized it through his website. And I learned a ton from him. And not only that,</p>
<p>but you just listen to him think. And it&rsquo;s almost like a philosophical meditation,</p>
<p>the way that he breaks things down and thinks about these different elements and has such a</p>
<p>holistic thought process. It&rsquo;s like watching a genius work. And, you know, he&rsquo;s also just a nice,</p>
<p>fun, sociable guy that like, you can, you can imagine being at your dinner table. So all that</p>
<p>combined. Which is not true for a lot of poker players, right? A lot of them are dark souls.</p>
<p>To say the least, yes. I like, I really like the, what is he, Canadian Daniel Negrano.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a nice guy. He&rsquo;s also a nice guy, but he&rsquo;s also somebody who&rsquo;s able to express his</p>
<p>thoughts about poker really well, but also in an entertaining way. He seems to be able to predict</p>
<p>cards better than anybody I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Like what. Did you watch the challenge? Which challenge?</p>
<p>He, he lost like a million dollars recently to Doug Polk. He lost a million dollars to Doug Polk,</p>
<p>heads up online. It&rsquo;s really interesting. Yeah. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s awesome to watch these guys work.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;re 20, 21. 21. 21. So, so asking you for advice is, is a little bit funny, but,</p>
<p>but at the same time, not because you&rsquo;ve created a social network. You&rsquo;ve created a startup from</p>
<p>nothing as we talked about earlier, like without knowing how to program you&rsquo;ve programmed. I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve taken this whole journey that a lot of people I think would be really inspired by.</p>
<p>So given that, and given the fact that 20 years from now, you probably laugh at the</p>
<p>advice you&rsquo;re going to give now. Absolutely. I hope so. If I don&rsquo;t laugh at the advice I give now,</p>
<p>something went desperately wrong, right? Yeah. So do you have advice for people that want to</p>
<p>follow in your footsteps and create a startup, whether it&rsquo;s in a software app domain or whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anything else. So I&rsquo;ll speak specifically about social media apps. Yes. Try to keep it as</p>
<p>narrow as possible so I can laugh as little as possible when I&rsquo;m 41. And what I would say is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like a 21, 22 year old, who&rsquo;s looking at me and being like, I want to do something like</p>
<p>this. What I would say is you probably know better than just about anyone. And if you have a feeling</p>
<p>in yourself that this is something that I have to do, and this is something I could imagine myself</p>
<p>doing for the next 10 years, because if you&rsquo;re successful, you are going to have to do it for</p>
<p>the next 10 years. And through the ups and the downs, through the amazing interviews with Lex,</p>
<p>and through the not so amazing articles you might have with other people, right? And you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to ride those highs and lows and you have to believe in what you&rsquo;re doing. But if you have that</p>
<p>feeling, what I would say is listen to as few people as possible, because people are experts</p>
<p>in domains. But when it comes to what&rsquo;s hot and what makes sense in a social context,</p>
<p>you are the authority as a young person who&rsquo;s going through these things and living in your</p>
<p>sort of milieu. And I mean, I&rsquo;ve talked to, at this point, you know, so many experts, so many</p>
<p>investors, VCs. You&rsquo;d be amazed at the advice I&rsquo;ve gotten. Advice I&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a minefield of bad advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest part, I think, for young people. And it&rsquo;s the thing, when people, like,</p>
<p>I help Yellies all the time who ask, like, I never turn down, when a founder asks me to have a</p>
<p>conversation, I never turn it down. I&rsquo;m always there for them. And the number one thing I worry</p>
<p>about is that at Yale, we&rsquo;re taught implicitly and explicitly that you listen to the adult in the</p>
<p>room, you listen to the person with the highest, you know, pay grade. And it&rsquo;s devastating, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how innovation dies. And, you know, yeah, it&rsquo;s intimidating to, like, you talk to VC who</p>
<p>probably means worth a billion dollars, a billion dollars, and they&rsquo;re going to tell you, you know,</p>
<p>all the, all the successful startups they have funders or even just a successful business owner,</p>
<p>uh, is going to tell you some advice and it&rsquo;s hard psychologically to think that they might be wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s the only way you succeed.</p>
<p>The only way you succeed, because if they knew what they were doing, they would have built it</p>
<p>themselves. Um, and what&rsquo;s especially hard is people go, oh, of course, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to people&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll listen to their advice, but I&rsquo;ll know why it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll, and I&rsquo;ll do my own thing. And that sounds great in the abstract, but sometimes you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t always even put your finger on why they&rsquo;re wrong. And I think to have the conviction,</p>
<p>to say, you&rsquo;re wrong and I can&rsquo;t tell you why, but I still think I&rsquo;m right. It&rsquo;s a rare thing,</p>
<p>especially at like, it&rsquo;s very counterintuitive. And you might even say it&rsquo;s hubris or arrogant,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s necessary because a lot of these things are, they&rsquo;re not things that you can really</p>
<p>put into words until you see them in action. Like a lot of them are kind of happy accidents.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been tough for me, like as a, as a person who, um, like I&rsquo;m very empathetic.</p>
<p>So I, when people tell me stuff, I kind of want to understand them. And it&rsquo;s been a painful process,</p>
<p>especially people close to me, basically everything I&rsquo;ve done, and especially in the</p>
<p>recent few years, a lot of people close to me said not to do, you know, and, uh, like,</p>
<p>my parents too, that&rsquo;s been a hard one is, is to basically acknowledge to myself that you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like, you, you don&rsquo;t, that everything you&rsquo;re going to say by way of advice for me is not going to be</p>
<p>helpful. Like, I love my parents very much, but like, they&rsquo;re just like, they don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And, and as you put it beautifully, it&rsquo;s very difficult to put your finger on exactly why,</p>
<p>because, uh, a lot of advice sounds reasonable. That&rsquo;s the worst kind. Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, if it, if it sounds really good, that just means it&rsquo;s an earworm. Like, that&rsquo;s like a song</p>
<p>that you hear on the radio and then you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re humming it in the car and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing. The more, the better it sounds, the more skeptical. Yeah. Reason is a,</p>
<p>is a bad drug. Like, should be very careful because, like, you know, the things that seem</p>
<p>impossible, every, every major innovation, every major business seems impossible at birth. But</p>
<p>even not just the impossible things, I think, you know, you look at like love, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to give advice, to sort of point out all the ways you can go wrong or marriage,</p>
<p>all the divorces that people go through, all the pain of years that you go through the divorce,</p>
<p>like the system of marriage, the marriage industrial complex, all the money that&rsquo;s wasted,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things. But that advice is useless when you&rsquo;re in love. I guess the best</p>
<p>the point is to just pat the person on the back and say, go get him, kid. Like, what is it? Good</p>
<p>Will Hunting. I went to see about a girl. Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good movie. I love that movie. But yeah,</p>
<p>that, that&rsquo;s, that took me a long time to figure out. I&rsquo;m still trying to fight through it,</p>
<p>but especially when you&rsquo;re young, that&rsquo;s hard. But, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but, uh, nothing in life is, uh, worth accomplishing is easy. So,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really interesting. You make that connection between like startup advice</p>
<p>and like your parents, because it&rsquo;s the exact same sort of mechanism where when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>your parents are usually like, right. Right. And the experts are usually right. And, you know,</p>
<p>if you listen to them and you, you, you follow their orders, you&rsquo;re going to go to a school</p>
<p>like Yale and at a certain point stops making sense. And I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve seen my friends at Yale</p>
<p>go down paths because they just continued listening to their parents that</p>
<p>I know in their heart of hearts is not the right path for them.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what? That&rsquo;s how I see like the education system. The whole point is to guide you</p>
<p>to a certain point in your life. And everybody&rsquo;s point is different. And your task is to,</p>
<p>at that point, to have a personal revolution and create your own path. But no one tells you that.</p>
<p>Nobody tells you that because they&rsquo;re, they want you to keep following the same path as they,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re leading you towards. Like they&rsquo;re not going to say your whole job is to eventually</p>
<p>rebel. Yeah. That&rsquo;s how revolution, that&rsquo;s how rebellion works. You&rsquo;re not supposed to be told,</p>
<p>but that is the task. They can take you just like you said, and depending who you are,</p>
<p>they can take you really far. But at a certain point you have to rebel. That could be getting</p>
<p>your PhD, that could be in your undergrad, that could be high school. Yeah. It could be any point.</p>
<p>One thing that I think played a pretty pivotal role, and I&rsquo;ve never really mentioned this,</p>
<p>he might not even know the person about to tell you about, in sort of me actually going out and</p>
<p>making Librex was that I was taking this graduate level math class, my sophomore year. And I met</p>
<p>this, I met this PhD student who was also in it and had considerable citations and also startup</p>
<p>experience. And I think he actually ended up being the CTO of a unicorn later on. I&rsquo;ve sort of lost</p>
<p>touch with him, but we&rsquo;re still Facebook friends as it is in the 21st century. So, and I was in a</p>
<p>class and I was telling him, I really want to, I really want to make this thing, but I have no</p>
<p>technical background. And he, this guy&rsquo;s a computer genius. He worked under Dan Spielman at Yale. So</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good guy. Right. And we were doing some math together. We were doing something on</p>
<p>discrepancy for those of you who really care about math. So combinatorics. And he just turns to me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, I think you could do it. Like, what do you mean you think I could do? He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I think you could do it. And I was like, really? But I respected this guy so much.</p>
<p>His name was Young Duck. Shout out to Young Duck. I respected this guy so much that I was like,</p>
<p>if Young Duck says I can do it and Young Duck is a legit genius and he knows, and he knows me,</p>
<p>because we were in two classes together and we&rsquo;d spent a lot of time together.</p>
<p>If he thinks I can do it, then who am I to say I can&rsquo;t do it?</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, that&rsquo;s a lesson for mentorship is like, by the way, he has no idea probably.</p>
<p>Well, he might not even remember that interaction, which is funny. But the point is</p>
<p>that when a crazy young kid comes up to you with a crazy dream, you know, every once in a while,</p>
<p>you should just pat him on the back and say, I believe in you. Like you can do it. If they look</p>
<p>up to you, that means your words have power. And if you say, no, no, come on, be like reasonable,</p>
<p>like, you know, finish your schoolwork kind of thing. Like that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s unreasonable to take</p>
<p>that leap now. Just finish your education, blah, blah, blah, whatever, whatever the reasonable</p>
<p>advice is every once in a while, maybe often as a mentor, you should say, you know, go see about a</p>
<p>girl in California or whatever the equivalent is. That was my moment. That was my good will hunting</p>
<p>moment. That&rsquo;s your good will hunting moment. Man, I miss Robin Williams. I was a special guy.</p>
<p>People love it when I ask about book recommendations in general. Of course,</p>
<p>your journey is just beginning. But is there something that jumps out to you? Technical,</p>
<p>fiction, philosophical, sci fi, coloring books, blog posts you read somewhere</p>
<p>that had an impact on your life? Video games. Video games that you recommend to others. Minecraft,</p>
<p>manual. Manga. I mean, yeah, video, you could mention video games too,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something that jumps out to you that just had like an impact.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll say I really liked the book, The War of Art, which is a book about creative resistance</p>
<p>and the creative struggle and what it means to be creative. And part of what I see in this</p>
<p>conversation and what you&rsquo;re doing, Lex, is so much of The War of Art&rsquo;s idea is that you just</p>
<p>keep writing and writing and writing until you get to the new crap. And you just roll with it,</p>
<p>right? And that&rsquo;s sort of what happens when you have like three hour conversations with people is</p>
<p>you can only have so much scripted or societally constructed stuff until you get to the real you.</p>
<p>And you have to show up. I mean, that book is kind of painful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really painful. And it&rsquo;s not something I would recommend for every part of it,</p>
<p>but for what it did in my life at the time. It also kind of normalized, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>part of my coming of age story is part of it&rsquo;s about realizing that I&rsquo;m a creative person and</p>
<p>person who needs to create. That&rsquo;s sort of a God given thing, I think, for a lot of people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t really feel like I can live without. And part of it was realizing</p>
<p>that even within some of these more rigid structures, it&rsquo;s okay that I don&rsquo;t sort of</p>
<p>fit in with them. And to hear about the struggles of other creatives was something for my own</p>
<p>self esteem and my own growing up that was really important to me. So I don&rsquo;t think the book itself</p>
<p>might be perfect, but for what it did for my life, it was really impactful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think exactly. The words may not be exactly right by way of advice, but I think</p>
<p>the journey that a lot of creatives take by reading that book is kind of profound. He also</p>
<p>has another one called Turning Pro, I think. I mean, he in general espouses like taking it</p>
<p>seriously. If you have a creative mind and you want to create something special in this world,</p>
<p>go do it. Don&rsquo;t show up. Look at that blank page.</p>
<p>So many people would tell me, would encourage me either blatantly or through implicit means</p>
<p>to basically take the Apple S seriously. It&rsquo;s a good signal, by the way. It&rsquo;s a good signal</p>
<p>because my really close friends, the ones who have always supported me, they never said that</p>
<p>because they got it. They understood that that was my path. And they might be skeptical. They might</p>
<p>be like, I mean, one of my friends I remember told me, I was always taken aback about why you</p>
<p>were so certain this would work out. And he&rsquo;s like, I finally got it once I saw it popping off,</p>
<p>but before that, I just didn&rsquo;t get it. But he still supported me. And I think it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good signal. And actually just the fact of going through this process has made me socially feel so</p>
<p>much more connected. And I&rsquo;ve somewhat consolidated my social life to some degree, but it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>more vulnerable, connected. And that&rsquo;s part of the creative process. I have to thank for that,</p>
<p>I think. There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s unstoppable about the creative mind. It&rsquo;s right there,</p>
<p>that fire. And I guess part of the thing that you&rsquo;re supposed to do is let that fire burn.</p>
<p>In whichever direction. And it&rsquo;s going to hurt. It&rsquo;s going to hurt. Fire will hurt.</p>
<p>But on the topic of video games, you mentioned the Stanley Parable offline.</p>
<p>You said you played some video games. Is there a video game that you especially love that you</p>
<p>recommend I play, for example? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll mention. It&rsquo;s actually really in keeping with what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking about. It&rsquo;s the Beginner&rsquo;s Guide, which was made by the same guy, Davey Rendon,</p>
<p>who made the Stanley Parable, which I briefly saw you. I just clicked the video and then I went to</p>
<p>sleep. It was like 2 a.m. But I briefly saw that you were looking at. And it&rsquo;s a game that is</p>
<p>better treated as art. And I think I won&rsquo;t claim to understand the creator, because that would be</p>
<p>a cardinal sin to me as a creative person. But it gets to the heart of a lot of the things that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about, which is the creative mind. The game can be interpreted in a lot of</p>
<p>ways in a feminist way. It could be interpreted as a story of friends. It could be interpreted</p>
<p>as the story of critics versus a creative. The way I like to interpret it, and I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>give away too much, is the story of the creative part of your mind that creates just for the sake</p>
<p>of creating. Meaning the part that creates for no rhyme or reason or clear meaning. It&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>ethereal. Versus the part that&rsquo;s, you could call it the editor. You could call it the pragmatist.</p>
<p>You could call it the necessary force of ego in our lives. We can&rsquo;t totally be egoless, right?</p>
<p>But we need to be egoless to be creative. And how that sort of internal censure, what role does it</p>
<p>play? And how do we allow our creative minds to be creative? And yet, how do we still become useful?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny that a video game could have this in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating tension, which reminds me about the ridiculous question that every once in a while</p>
<p>asks about meaning and death. So, this whole ride ends. You&rsquo;re at the beginning of the ride,</p>
<p>but it could end any day, actually. That&rsquo;s kind of the way human life works. You could die today,</p>
<p>you could die tomorrow. Do you think about your mortality? Do you think about death?</p>
<p>Do you meditate on it? And in that context, as the creative, but a pragmatist, too,</p>
<p>as running a startup, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, on mortality, right? About three years ago, four years ago now, I was excited to go to</p>
<p>Yale. I was playing six hours of squash a day, which squash is a sport I love so much. And I was</p>
<p>really getting a lot better. And I was even thinking I could maybe walk onto the Yale team.</p>
<p>And I woke up one day, I felt really, really sick. I went and I decided not to go squash that day.</p>
<p>I wanted to, I almost did. And you&rsquo;ll see how this story turns out. You&rsquo;ll decide if I made the right</p>
<p>choice. I decided not to go squash today. And I decided to get my driver&rsquo;s license, or I had to</p>
<p>get my driver&rsquo;s license because I wanted to get a driver&rsquo;s license before I went off to college,</p>
<p>because otherwise I might never get it. And I&rsquo;m going back and I successfully got my driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license for Hashem. And I go back to my house and I decided I don&rsquo;t want to drive back because I</p>
<p>just feel so sick. Like things are spinning. I have the worst headache. I come home, I run back</p>
<p>right into my bed and feeling really sick to the point where I even like asked my mom who is a</p>
<p>doctor, I&rsquo;m like, should I go to the hospital? And she&rsquo;s like, you can just wait it out and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll get better. And then, you know, and then at one point I look at my arms and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>covered in this like red splotchy stuff. Yeah. And I&rsquo;m like, mom, I think. And she&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>we have to go. And so I go there and they&rsquo;re like, you have scarlet fever. And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing we can do. You should probably just go back home. So I go back home. Six hours</p>
<p>later I wake up in the morning. They&rsquo;d let me out at like 3 a.m. They let me, I come home in</p>
<p>the morning and I feel this, like a spear through my chest. And I never felt anything like it. And</p>
<p>I was, it was very disconcerting when you have a, cause we&rsquo;re all used to different sorts of pain,</p>
<p>right? And that was the sort of pain I never felt before. As far as an athlete, you&rsquo;re used to like,</p>
<p>you know, pain. So I told my parents and immediately we hop back in the car. We go up</p>
<p>to the same hospital I was at six hours ago. And they initially didn&rsquo;t want to let me in. And I</p>
<p>was like, I have chest pain. They&rsquo;re like, oh, come in. Cause they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re a healthy guy,</p>
<p>wait your turn. And I&rsquo;m like, no, you don&rsquo;t understand. I have like a pain in my chest.</p>
<p>And then they let me in. They start doing tests on me. They like put something like in my back,</p>
<p>which is really scary. It&rsquo;s a huge needle. And I&rsquo;m smiling because it&rsquo;s like one of the ways</p>
<p>I reduce stress, I guess, or deal with this sort of thing and make light of it. But like,</p>
<p>you know, that, you know, it&rsquo;s definitely very scary in the moment, shocking and scary.</p>
<p>And they go and they, they do a bunch of tests and they determined that a virus like attacked</p>
<p>my heart and I had myocarditis and pericarditis. And they said I had maybe 25 to 35% chance at</p>
<p>one point of dying. And so I&rsquo;m sitting in my, they admit me into the hospital. I&rsquo;m in the bed,</p>
<p>in my bed for about three weeks. And I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m just standing there. And I had this moment</p>
<p>also that I remember very specifically where I was in so much pain that like I was crying,</p>
<p>not out of like emotional standpoint, but actually just purely out of the pain itself. Like I could</p>
<p>feel my heart in my chest. And when I leaned back, I felt it touch my rib cage and feel horrible.</p>
<p>So I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep and lean back. I had to lean forward all throughout the night. Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m feeling my, and I&rsquo;m feeling my chest. I&rsquo;m feeling this terrible pain in my chest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m crying unstoppably. And I mean, also maybe I should mention that at the time I was someone</p>
<p>who like refused to take in anything into my body that wasn&rsquo;t natural. And so a lot of the time I,</p>
<p>I tried to be unmedicated. Eventually I didn&rsquo;t allow them to add a little medication to my body,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just so much uncertainty and pain. And the first time I had to come to terms with</p>
<p>mortality. First of all, I think you still should have gone and played squash. I mean, come on.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah. I thought you&rsquo;re serious about this. You still carry that with you sort of.</p>
<p>There is power to realizing the ride can end. Right. Very suddenly. Very suddenly. Yeah.</p>
<p>And painfully. And, you know, it, it has pragmatic application to like what you,</p>
<p>to trajectories you take through life. Right.</p>
<p>Something else that is worth noting is that I, for the next year, couldn&rsquo;t walk to my classes.</p>
<p>So I get to Yale, they put me in a medical single alone, and I have to get shuttled to all my</p>
<p>classes. I have to ask, I had to ask a few professors to even move classes so I could</p>
<p>actually get there. I can&rsquo;t move my book. I can&rsquo;t lift my book bags. I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t walk upstairs.</p>
<p>I spent like 12 hours a day in my dorm room, just like staring at the walls and more so. And more</p>
<p>than that, all this, like, you, I got to watch my body, like, deteriorate and like the muscle,</p>
<p>like fall off of it. Cause I was, I was taking these pills and they&rsquo;re kind of catabolic. And</p>
<p>for an 18 year old, I mean, I think every 18 year old has feelings about their body, man or woman.</p>
<p>And, you know, just seeing this, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re watching sort of death transpire. And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also very fatigued because your heart&rsquo;s not at peak condition. And you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>the future and a lot of the things you enjoy have kind of been stripped away from you.</p>
<p>And I took up a meditation practice, like started with like five minutes a day. At my peak, I was at</p>
<p>like 40 minutes a day, kept it up consistently for about two years. And I started thinking about,</p>
<p>like, what do I want to do? And like, what do I care about? And to get to your point,</p>
<p>I think you were asking, like, how does this carry forward? Right? I think I realized that,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s an end and I realized that there are things I believe and things that I believe</p>
<p>that might not be so overtly popular, but that I truly think make the world a better place.</p>
<p>And in spite of, and then basically, if my conditions provided, I wanted to make something</p>
<p>that I wanted to do something that would make me feel sort of whole in that way.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s an amazing journey to take that time and to come out on the other end.</p>
<p>Now, man, that&rsquo;s amazing. I did not realize like that there was a long term struggle.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s in the end, if you do succeed, will have a profound positive impact because</p>
<p>struggle is ultimately like humbling, but also empowering. So I&rsquo;m glad to see that. But from the</p>
<p>perspective of the creator of the other ridiculous question about meaning, do you think about this</p>
<p>kind of stuff? Is that the, you know, the meaning of life for you, the meaning of life for us,</p>
<p>descendants of apes in general? The first thing I&rsquo;d like to say is that I think part of like,</p>
<p>when we talk about the meaning of life, the part of it is the fact that we get to struggle with</p>
<p>this question and we get to do it together for a long time. And we sometimes, I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s accepting that there&rsquo;s no meaning at all. And sometimes I think it&rsquo;s accepting that,</p>
<p>or even just parsing the phrase and thinking about the meaning of life. I sometimes I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m very young. Again, I hope that anything I say now is going to be very different in the</p>
<p>future because I think life has so many meanings that it&rsquo;ll be crazy to see what I think in 20</p>
<p>years about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, rise from the future, cut them some slack.</p>
<p>Please do. Perspective, perspective, perspective. Having said that, you know, I think part of what</p>
<p>brings meaning to my life is things like this, where we think about these things with people</p>
<p>who are really, really, really on the ball, and we get to connect with these people.</p>
<p>That certainly brings meaning to my life, human connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, this conversation is just another, like, echo of the thing you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>in a digital space, right? That&rsquo;s the same kind of magic. From what I understand about what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to create is the same reason I fell in love with the long form podcasting, like as a fan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I listen to long form podcasts. Is there something deeply human and genuine</p>
<p>about the interchange through their voice? But I do think that connection through text can be</p>
<p>even more powerful. Like I think about letters. I still write letters to Russia. You know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something powerful in letters. When you put a lot of yourself in the words you say,</p>
<p>in the words you write, that&rsquo;s powerful. You can really communicate, not just the actual semantic</p>
<p>meaning of the words, but like a lot of who you are through those words and create real connection.</p>
<p>So I hope you succeed there. And listen, Ryan, I think this is an incredible conversation. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad that people like you are fighting the good fight for bringing out the best in human nature</p>
<p>in the digital space. I think that&rsquo;s a battleground where the good will win, like love will win. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re creating technology that does just that. So thank you so much for wasting all</p>
<p>your time for coming down. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do in the future. Thanks for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me. Bam. How many finger guns have you gotten at the end of the podcast?</p>
<p>Zero. Two now. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Shiller. And thank you</p>
<p>to our sponsors, Allform, Magic Spoon, BetterHelp, and Brave. Click their links to support this</p>
<p>podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from George Washington on March 15, 1783.</p>
<p>If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
