<p>Ôªøhey guys welcome to the webinar I have</p>
<p>to tell you this a quick story I see one</p>
<p>of these these are called</p>
<p>credit card knives okay to be open like</p>
<p>this little piece of metal so I saw this</p>
<p>online the other day and it was free</p>
<p>plus shipping so I ordered I thought was</p>
<p>kind of cool because for box cutters you</p>
<p>know so I put it in my wallet okay</p>
<p>I had a seminar scheduled at something</p>
<p>called The Voice of America which</p>
<p>basically goes to Afghanistan so here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a seminar for to</p>
<p>Afghanistan on nutrition and this</p>
<p>happens to be in a governmental building</p>
<p>yeah you know what happened so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever bring one of these in the</p>
<p>governmental agency or building so I</p>
<p>walk in I completely forgot about it the</p>
<p>police the guy the the guard basically</p>
<p>calls locked down you know they put me</p>
<p>on the wall they handcuffed me I was</p>
<p>like I said no now you could take it</p>
<p>take it uh you know take it just I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s going on here so they put me</p>
<p>in a room and to call the FBI yeah so</p>
<p>that was kind of freaked out so they</p>
<p>come in they&rsquo;re like what&rsquo;s the intent</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m going to cut boxes I had no</p>
<p>idea that this was a my forgot about it</p>
<p>basically and it&rsquo;s weird because week</p>
<p>before I took this on the plane and no</p>
<p>one saw it so anyway that was a scare so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting in the in this room which</p>
<p>is a like a waiting room it&rsquo;s like a I</p>
<p>guess a snack room for some of the</p>
<p>government you know so I&rsquo;m sitting there</p>
<p>and handcuffs and they had a cake</p>
<p>sitting right there and there&rsquo;s two cops</p>
<p>talking about nutrition and how sugars</p>
<p>bad for you and of course I had to chime</p>
<p>in and say you know that has a pretty</p>
<p>high glycemic index and they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about being so and then I realized</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably not going to take</p>
<p>advice from someone in handcuffs so I I</p>
<p>kind of just waited for the FBI to come</p>
<p>in there and then like what&rsquo;s the intent</p>
<p>said I just thought it was cool and so</p>
<p>they let me go and I actually have done</p>
<p>doing the the seminar live are not</p>
<p>liable to be recorded so my wife&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever put this in your wallet ever</p>
<p>again so that was crazy so so today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be doing a seminar on</p>
<p>something called beyond weight loss so</p>
<p>this is going to go way beyond my lesson</p>
<p>I have some slides I want to show you so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go right to it um let me just open</p>
<p>my slides right here okay good</p>
<p>all right so you can see this right now</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the thing um there are people</p>
<p>who try to lose weight that just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>no matter what and then other people</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even do barely half of what</p>
<p>the person is doing like a person with a</p>
<p>real stubborn metabolism make him lose</p>
<p>weight and that&rsquo;s really what frustrates</p>
<p>people so I really want to cover exactly</p>
<p>what you can do to bust through the</p>
<p>plateau but this seminar is for the</p>
<p>person that has tried everything and</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go but to do that we it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about weight loss it&rsquo;s we have</p>
<p>to go beyond that and so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about that all right so to do that</p>
<p>you need to connect the dots and and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about the relationship between</p>
<p>cause and effect and as you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>learn weight is really not the issue and</p>
<p>I want to first just kind of mention</p>
<p>like why medicine fails especially for</p>
<p>the endocrine system especially for</p>
<p>hormones you go to the doctor you do a</p>
<p>blood test either it shows normal and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do anything or it shows</p>
<p>abnormal and they give you hormones so</p>
<p>medicine is really the management of</p>
<p>effects or symptoms so they really only</p>
<p>work on the superficial level the</p>
<p>surface area they don&rsquo;t ask why they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t evaluate</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about digging deeper</p>
<p>into the root cause</p>
<p>evaluation meat is a French word which</p>
<p>means to look so if you were to look and</p>
<p>keep looking at the problem you would</p>
<p>find out a lot of information and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you what what I found but</p>
<p>we need to ask why we need to get to the</p>
<p>root of the problem and medicine doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that unfortunately medicine has made</p>
<p>become so segmented so specialized so</p>
<p>overly specialized what to one part of</p>
<p>the body that you can&rsquo;t really evaluate</p>
<p>one part of the body without</p>
<p>understanding the other parts because</p>
<p>they all connect you&rsquo;ve heard the</p>
<p>expression the hip bones connected to</p>
<p>the thigh bone right that is so true so</p>
<p>treating the cause fixes the symptom</p>
<p>treating the symptom does not fix the</p>
<p>cost and then the question is why I mean</p>
<p>this is a terrible statistic 98% of all</p>
<p>weight loss cases fail that&rsquo;s crazy I</p>
<p>mean any other area uh I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>fixing cars going to the moon if you had</p>
<p>these ratios this this track record this</p>
<p>percentage of failures oh my gosh that</p>
<p>would be terrible but with weight loss</p>
<p>the great majority of people fail why</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re treating the weight</p>
<p>weight is a symptom and this is what you</p>
<p>really need to get across if you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>to my webinars before you know about</p>
<p>this already but for those that never</p>
<p>attended you have to treat weight like a</p>
<p>symptom you really don&rsquo;t even have a</p>
<p>weight problem and I&rsquo;m will have to give</p>
<p>you a t-shirt I don&rsquo;t have a weight</p>
<p>problem right on the back it&rsquo;s a weight</p>
<p>symptom it&rsquo;s an effect and a symptom</p>
<p>basically is something that indicates</p>
<p>something else and every time you treat</p>
<p>it you never get anywhere because you</p>
<p>either camouflage it or you continue</p>
<p>this symptom so what should you do if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t this wait well we need to</p>
<p>evaluate we want to go deeper we want to</p>
<p>find out what&rsquo;s behind so an evaluation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to ask ask a lot of</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>basically we&rsquo;re going to ask why so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do right now</p>
<p>if you look at the different shapes of</p>
<p>people there&rsquo;s really four main shapes</p>
<p>that people have and based on their</p>
<p>shape you can get a lot of information</p>
<p>based on their symptoms you can get</p>
<p>information on what&rsquo;s behind the shape</p>
<p>yes your hormones do control where the</p>
<p>fat is deposited on your body but the</p>
<p>most common shape is the adrenal shape</p>
<p>and that is the person with the</p>
<p>midsection wait now what&rsquo;s unique about</p>
<p>the adrenal shape is that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different type of fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called visceral fat because</p>
<p>visceral means around the organs in</p>
<p>midsection this isn&rsquo;t a completely</p>
<p>different type of problem and um so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just kind of cover what the</p>
<p>adrenal glands on adrenal glands are</p>
<p>tiny glands on top of your kidney add on</p>
<p>top of renal kidney that react and adapt</p>
<p>a body to stress so they adapt your body</p>
<p>every part of your body to a stress</p>
<p>State so if you can envision you being</p>
<p>in stress what&rsquo;s going to happen to the</p>
<p>heart rate what&rsquo;s going to happen to the</p>
<p>salivary glands you&rsquo;re going to dry up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when you&rsquo;re you do a public</p>
<p>speech in front of 500 people your mouth</p>
<p>gets real dry so you might urinate I</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s all these different</p>
<p>physiological things that happen when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a stress State so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>go through what happens to your body if</p>
<p>the adrenal glands are over producing</p>
<p>too much hormone for too long</p>
<p>you get stuck in this excessive thinking</p>
<p>analyzing stuff solving problems 24/7</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re trying to sleep</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sleep so you end up on the</p>
<p>computer and your eyes are gets strange</p>
<p>right you need coffee to wake up you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get out of bed easily you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fixated on problems why because the</p>
<p>nature of the adrenal is to solve</p>
<p>problems so what are you doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to survive by solving problems</p>
<p>silly and they&rsquo;re randomly becoming in</p>
<p>there constantly so you saw one another</p>
<p>one comes up so what happens in your</p>
<p>mind is all these problems can trigger a</p>
<p>lot of stress on the adrenals so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to just turn it off here&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>multitasking and someone just asked you</p>
<p>you you really think that multitasking</p>
<p>you really get more done than if you</p>
<p>just focus on one thing some people</p>
<p>think that but no it&rsquo;s your power is</p>
<p>your focus on one thing and doing one</p>
<p>thing at a time and so all of your</p>
<p>attention is on that one thing and not</p>
<p>on anything else multitasking really</p>
<p>disperses you and you really don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>productive and you&rsquo;re not productive</p>
<p>stress States you&rsquo;re kind of always in a</p>
<p>stress rate or straight and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overwhelmed libido shuts off why would a</p>
<p>libido shut off because when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being chased by a tiger you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>time to reproduce all those sex hormones</p>
<p>are blocked you get high blood pressure</p>
<p>think about if you&rsquo;re being chased by a</p>
<p>tiger your blood pressure tends to be</p>
<p>higher because of the stress state that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in so the person is very</p>
<p>dispersant we can call this a dee dee if</p>
<p>we want but really is an adrenal symptom</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one asthma what why is asthma</p>
<p>adrenal symptom because think about what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re treated with a bronco steroid</p>
<p>inhaler what our inhalers they&rsquo;re their</p>
<p>adrenal hormones so these steroids</p>
<p>including prednisone anything with</p>
<p>prednisone</p>
<p>you know prednisone is an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory it&rsquo;s used for pain</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used for allergies as you chew</p>
<p>asthma it&rsquo;s used for inflammation all</p>
<p>sorts of things anything that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>used for is an adrenal problem but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do anything for the adrenal</p>
<p>allergies our adrenal um blood sugars</p>
<p>this is a person on my right taking</p>
<p>their blood sugars why is that because</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re during stress mode your body</p>
<p>is going to tap into sugar fuel and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why um I have people that will</p>
<p>eat good</p>
<p>but they still can&rsquo;t reap a lose weight</p>
<p>because their blood Sugar&rsquo;s are</p>
<p>constantly up and down because the</p>
<p>adrenal is turning your body into proton</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>it literally converts your muscles into</p>
<p>sugar yeah so one big cause of diabetes</p>
<p>is an adrenal so in this sense diabetes</p>
<p>is a symptom but but if we don&rsquo;t look at</p>
<p>it like that doing we treat it as a</p>
<p>disease acne is an adrenal problem</p>
<p>because one of the hormones produced by</p>
<p>the adrenal makes excess of acne sleep</p>
<p>apnea is an adrenal symptom snoring is</p>
<p>asleep is an adrenal symptom because the</p>
<p>the tissue in the back of the throat and</p>
<p>the back of the sinuses get thicker with</p>
<p>adrenal problems muscle cramps and your</p>
<p>caps in your legs is an adrenal symptom</p>
<p>why because the adrenals deplete your</p>
<p>electrolytes specifically potassium and</p>
<p>sodium and calcium and you get cramps</p>
<p>hair loss a special alopecia which is</p>
<p>like little pockets of hair that come</p>
<p>out of your head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an adrenal symptom - brain fog</p>
<p>cleaning out the brain fog is an adrenal</p>
<p>symptom as well because you lose your um</p>
<p>your memory because the high levels of</p>
<p>adrenal hormone called cortisol depletes</p>
<p>oxygen in the brain high flashes is an</p>
<p>adrenal because the adrenal gland backs</p>
<p>up the ovary during menopause and if the</p>
<p>adrenal gland is already tired going</p>
<p>into menopause you get hot flashes</p>
<p>cravings to specifically salty foods</p>
<p>chips salsa chocolate and sugar and</p>
<p>carbs why because the in the adrenal</p>
<p>state you&rsquo;re burning more sugar fuel</p>
<p>than you are fat okay loss of collagen</p>
<p>that shows up in loose skin underneath</p>
<p>the chin underneath your arm you might</p>
<p>see your skin gets thinned those are</p>
<p>adrenal symptoms</p>
<p>memory issues is adrenal</p>
<p>absent-mindedness</p>
<p>and loss of position and time and space</p>
<p>you might kind of like okay where am I</p>
<p>going again you know you might lose your</p>
<p>ability to figure out where you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>because the adrenal will affect certain</p>
<p>parts of the brain</p>
<p>anything climbing stairs incline getting</p>
<p>up too fast feeling dizzy is an adrenal</p>
<p>symptom that&rsquo;s why um people when they</p>
<p>climb stairs they might their legs might</p>
<p>get heavier that&rsquo;s an adrenal symptom</p>
<p>bloating is an adrenal simply because</p>
<p>you lose the fluids in your and your</p>
<p>bile ducts in your liver and those you</p>
<p>lack something called bio b i le and</p>
<p>that bile is the thing that helps digest</p>
<p>especially fatty foods so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest that well so you might you eat</p>
<p>and you get blow-up loaded or at the end</p>
<p>of the day your stomach is totally</p>
<p>bloated you feel like you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>you in the morning it&rsquo;s less that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adrenal symptom because the gut swells</p>
<p>heartburn is adrenal symptom because it</p>
<p>produces acid reflux I mean think about</p>
<p>how many people are taking antacids for</p>
<p>this low tolerance to stress so I have a</p>
<p>question do you know anyone has a low</p>
<p>tolerance of stress friends family</p>
<p>neighbors they can&rsquo;t tolerate they get</p>
<p>edgy easily that isn&rsquo;t adrenal symptom</p>
<p>falling asleep after you eat lunch is an</p>
<p>adrenal symptom you even need for a nap</p>
<p>because the blood sugars are out of</p>
<p>whack and it&rsquo;ll make you tired like</p>
<p>after a Thanksgiving meal so check this</p>
<p>out I&rsquo;m going to show you something this</p>
<p>is a book called CIPA this book is in</p>
<p>every single medical library book store</p>
<p>and this is what it looks like right</p>
<p>here check this out it&rsquo;s called by Frank</p>
<p>neder it&rsquo;s called civil cyclop√¶dia it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a medical Australia killest raishin for</p>
<p>the endocrine system so this book is</p>
<p>amazing because it goes it gives you</p>
<p>pictures and I&rsquo;m showing right now all</p>
<p>the effects of cortisol this is a stress</p>
<p>hormone look at bone loss eventually</p>
<p>osteoporosis acne inflammation</p>
<p>and cysts brain fog excessive thinking</p>
<p>high cholesterol blood sugars acid</p>
<p>reflux immune factors autoimmune</p>
<p>diseases viruses come out of remission</p>
<p>asthma and then we have stretch marks</p>
<p>hypertension sleep problems I mean this</p>
<p>gland right here is pumping out fat</p>
<p>right into the gut as it why because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a survival mechanism all this</p>
<p>information is in this book I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>making these symptoms up though I want</p>
<p>to show you something because let me see</p>
<p>where I am right here I might here good</p>
<p>oh let me just go share it bump me out</p>
<p>okay so let me just go back to this okay</p>
<p>so you can see all these symptoms now</p>
<p>you get a Buffalo Hump in the upper back</p>
<p>osteoporosis thin-skinned moonface</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s around face all these things um</p>
<p>before I get it next lightest one up for</p>
<p>those of you that don&rsquo;t know me most of</p>
<p>you do know me my name is dr. Berg DC</p>
<p>that stands for District of Columbia no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding dr. Carr pratik</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do chiropractic anymore I do</p>
<p>nutrition functional nutrition I also</p>
<p>develop my own techniques manual therapy</p>
<p>kind of an acupressure no needles but</p>
<p>just manual work on the different parts</p>
<p>of the body relating to endocrine stress</p>
<p>adrenal stress that type of thing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been in practice 25 years my clinic is</p>
<p>in Northern Virginia I personally worked</p>
<p>on 45,000 people I taught nutrition at</p>
<p>Howard University as an associate</p>
<p>professor I also wrote a book the seven</p>
<p>principles of fat burning um it was the</p>
<p>number one best seller on Amazon trained</p>
<p>over 2,500 doctors and alternative</p>
<p>medicine so I basically trained doctors</p>
<p>in alternative things</p>
<p>I delivered over 4,900 seminars to a lot</p>
<p>of the governmental agencies on a</p>
<p>monthly basis I even I have even done</p>
<p>seminars to the FBI and the same</p>
<p>organization that came in to make sure I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a terrorist for that pocket</p>
<p>credit card knife I had over close to a</p>
<p>thousand YouTube videos and nine million</p>
<p>views so far and I developed the body</p>
<p>types but real quickly just I want to</p>
<p>just let you know my story I got into</p>
<p>this out of necessity at a desperation</p>
<p>because I never ate anything good until</p>
<p>I was like 21 22 23 years old I ate</p>
<p>lived on sugar Alabang Chuck my</p>
<p>grandmother made was the most amazing</p>
<p>cook and she would make these cakes for</p>
<p>me every birthday and I would pretty</p>
<p>much just keep eating</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t just eat one um so I that</p>
<p>kind of net lasted until I was in my 20s</p>
<p>but little did I know at a blood sugar</p>
<p>issue back then I also was in wrestling</p>
<p>for four years and I always had to cut</p>
<p>weight so I would starve myself for two</p>
<p>or three days and eat nothing and then</p>
<p>pig out right before the match on the</p>
<p>junky submarine sandwich or a chocolate</p>
<p>milkshake I know it was so so stupid in</p>
<p>the area of health it was crazy I went</p>
<p>into the military and went to basic</p>
<p>training and by the time basic training</p>
<p>was done I could barely do a push-up</p>
<p>because my body with the stress and lack</p>
<p>of sleep and poor nutrition was so far</p>
<p>gone that I could barely pass the PT</p>
<p>test I mean it was crazy I mean I went I</p>
<p>took I went to state and wrestling and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know how I got through that</p>
<p>because I was exhausted and then things</p>
<p>kept getting worse until I had arthritis</p>
<p>constipation chronic fatigue syndrome a</p>
<p>lot of inflammation all done my spine</p>
<p>and this is a picture of me I think it</p>
<p>was 27 or 28 I was taking massive</p>
<p>amounts of prunes we have three kids I</p>
<p>had no energy for my kids it was a mess</p>
<p>so out of desperation I tried everything</p>
<p>and I was the epitome of treating</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>take I was taking 94 pills 94 vitamins</p>
<p>to try to wake up to try to get better</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t working and so I was a</p>
<p>necessity found some things that work</p>
<p>for me and then other things and I</p>
<p>started to obsessively study nutrition</p>
<p>and the unique thing about what I did</p>
<p>which a lot of researchers don&rsquo;t do is</p>
<p>when I study something I don&rsquo;t just scan</p>
<p>the data I take every single word that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fully understand and I look it up</p>
<p>in the dictionary</p>
<p>including the derivation where it came</p>
<p>from so I am digesting every piece of</p>
<p>information as I go and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s different from most people who do</p>
<p>research is they don&rsquo;t go that extra</p>
<p>distance to really understand these</p>
<p>basics and how things relate um they</p>
<p>kind of just read through it and then</p>
<p>they gloss over these big words and I</p>
<p>found that the more you do that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be more confused so when I</p>
<p>study something I study it thoroughly</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably one of my successful</p>
<p>actions of making some huge</p>
<p>breakthroughs as a practitioner but</p>
<p>anyway to make a long story short I was</p>
<p>28 I was very sick I got better I&rsquo;m 29</p>
<p>now now I&rsquo;m just kidding I&rsquo;m 50 but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been working on my health and I am way</p>
<p>healthier than I am now than I was back</p>
<p>when I was 27 or 28 so it&rsquo;s right now as</p>
<p>I look at the problem back then I had</p>
<p>very low awareness now I have a lot of</p>
<p>awareness about what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>people and it&rsquo;s about observing the</p>
<p>obvious and this is this is the big</p>
<p>thing right now that I want to talk</p>
<p>about the big obvious thing that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is that medicine has switched</p>
<p>symptoms or effects for causes we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>making all these symptoms as diseases</p>
<p>and then were treating them with over</p>
<p>specialized doctors now I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the medical profession doing this I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the drug companies behind the</p>
<p>scenes that are manipulating pulling the</p>
<p>strings they&rsquo;re the puppet master they</p>
<p>the ones that</p>
<p>kind of set up the medical universities</p>
<p>to teach certain things the problem is</p>
<p>the medical profession when you&rsquo;re a med</p>
<p>student and I did pre-med you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>time to digest this information to</p>
<p>really evaluate to see if it&rsquo;s true or</p>
<p>not you have to pass the test so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a lot of memorization without</p>
<p>learning so you end up graduating not</p>
<p>really knowing the body like you should</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have a chance to apply it</p>
<p>so you graduate as a profession that</p>
<p>basically manages symptoms with drugs</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty much as far as it gets</p>
<p>okay and then when you do that you are</p>
<p>not very flexible on your thinking as</p>
<p>far as your ability to look at other</p>
<p>solutions you have a lot of fixed ideas</p>
<p>so what they&rsquo;ve done is they switch</p>
<p>these symptoms for causes and because</p>
<p>they sound very very scientific</p>
<p>you might legitimately think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s my disease but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really I mean think about like just acid</p>
<p>reflux they have a disease now GERD it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as the disease its gastro esophageal</p>
<p>reflux disorder all that means is you</p>
<p>get reflux some disease everything is</p>
<p>camouflaged as a disease even obesity</p>
<p>check this out last week in the American</p>
<p>Medical Association voted to classify</p>
<p>obesity as a disease in one day 78</p>
<p>million member American adults and 12</p>
<p>million American children were deemed to</p>
<p>have a medical condition that needs</p>
<p>treatment this is the drug company this</p>
<p>is not the medical profession somehow</p>
<p>they talked the AMA into doing this</p>
<p>probably with lobbyist group whatever</p>
<p>but this is what&rsquo;s happening they did</p>
<p>the same thing with cholesterol medicine</p>
<p>has become a business unfortunately you</p>
<p>know this I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not telling you</p>
<p>anything you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>not surprised but they did it with a</p>
<p>cholesterol cholesterol normal values</p>
<p>you should be to 12 now it&rsquo;s 200 you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to lower it down to 150 now and</p>
<p>basically going to get everyone on</p>
<p>medication and you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>off of it and you stay on it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really bad people don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>they also did with the BMI body mass</p>
<p>index they lower that and just made</p>
<p>every one L piece so welcome to modern</p>
<p>medicine it&rsquo;s basically a business okay</p>
<p>so giving back to the adrenals coming</p>
<p>off my soapbox right now what&rsquo;s unique</p>
<p>about the adrenals well they are very</p>
<p>unique in that the adrenals do not have</p>
<p>an off switch if you look at the</p>
<p>electrical wires from the brain that</p>
<p>control different parts of the body</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two systems that make up</p>
<p>something called the autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system basically it&rsquo;s the automatic</p>
<p>nervous system behind the scenes you</p>
<p>have the sympathetic which is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the flight or fight mechanism and</p>
<p>then we have the parasympathetic don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about the names right now but the</p>
<p>parasympathetic is kind of like the turn</p>
<p>off switch the thing that works when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re relaxing when you&rsquo;re sleeping and</p>
<p>the sympathetics work when you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>chased by tiger now if we look at the</p>
<p>little circuit board that comes out of</p>
<p>the spinal column from the brain look it</p>
<p>down here you&rsquo;ll see from the solar</p>
<p>plexus it comes right down this wire</p>
<p>that goes right into your adrenals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the on switch but guess what the</p>
<p>adrenals don&rsquo;t have any parasympathetic</p>
<p>control there&rsquo;s no off switch for the</p>
<p>adrenal and I found that interesting why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird so what causes the adrenal</p>
<p>glands to get stuck on in pump out</p>
<p>excessive cortisol you guessed it stress</p>
<p>stress will do it um the other</p>
<p>interesting unique thing about the</p>
<p>adrenal and about basically about stress</p>
<p>in general is that there is always</p>
<p>stress before you start gaining weight</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always some stress on pregnancy</p>
<p>stress a loss of loved one hysterectomy</p>
<p>tonsillitis tonsillectomy infections</p>
<p>loss of some severe stress change of</p>
<p>hormones menopause all that</p>
<p>basically triggers the adrenal to then</p>
<p>put on the weight so the waving your gut</p>
<p>is not just the food thing it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>stress and here&rsquo;s the other thing that I</p>
<p>found and I found this by I have a test</p>
<p>that measures the autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system and for those of you that want to</p>
<p>know the name of it is called the it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>heart called heart rate variability</p>
<p>technology it measures the data between</p>
<p>heartbeats which basically is the</p>
<p>nervous system that&rsquo;s controlling the</p>
<p>heart but it controls the whole body and</p>
<p>what you can see from this test you can</p>
<p>measure accumulated stress and this is</p>
<p>the other thing I want to talk about</p>
<p>your body is like a sponge it</p>
<p>accumulates stress and stress gets stuck</p>
<p>in the body so look at this first this</p>
<p>dial up here you see this tall dial up</p>
<p>here it&rsquo;s all the way to the right</p>
<p>normally it should be straight up and</p>
<p>down so yours I mean this person has one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too high that means that their</p>
<p>body is stuck in some stress even when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re relaxed their body is in present</p>
<p>time stuck in stress but this but their</p>
<p>bodies are their adrenals are reacting</p>
<p>to old stress that stress that they had</p>
<p>in in the 80s and the 70s yes that is</p>
<p>true so your body tends to hold on the</p>
<p>stress very tightly here&rsquo;s another graph</p>
<p>over time when that stays too high it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>burn out this smaller dial which is the</p>
<p>recovery time the recovery dial should</p>
<p>be all the way to the right so when you</p>
<p>will lose the recovery now you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recover to exercise stress into people</p>
<p>stress you become irritable people get</p>
<p>on your nerves especially incompetent</p>
<p>people especially insane people you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t watch the news you can&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>scary movies before bed so your your</p>
<p>body is very very edgy um and that is</p>
<p>because the adrenal system has been</p>
<p>burned down and so there are techniques</p>
<p>you can do regular techniques advanced</p>
<p>techniques to extract this stress and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to introduce you to something</p>
<p>new that I created in the last few</p>
<p>months since it&rsquo;s a membership site that</p>
<p>allows you to learn techniques but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you some things but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some advanced techniques that I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll eventually want to learn to</p>
<p>pull this stress power and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>very effective so so let me just show</p>
<p>you this I want to ask you a questions I</p>
<p>think this sense doesn&rsquo;t make sense why</p>
<p>do these diets have in common it should</p>
<p>be what do these diets have in common</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to do and what do all</p>
<p>successful diets have in common you have</p>
<p>an idea here these are successful diets</p>
<p>Atkins low carb South Beach protein</p>
<p>power paleo ketogenic manifest they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all really good diets but what do they</p>
<p>have in common they&rsquo;re lower insulin</p>
<p>diets they lower insulin what does that</p>
<p>mean it means they lower sugar so one</p>
<p>foundant a fundamental principle that is</p>
<p>very successful is you need to lower</p>
<p>insulin if you want to lose weight right</p>
<p>so you probably already know this but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t probably know why here&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>insulin which basically is triggered by</p>
<p>sugar is a dominating hormone in the</p>
<p>presence of a little bit of insulin all</p>
<p>six fat burning hormones get nullified</p>
<p>blocked cancelled out so it&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>matter of trying to trigger these</p>
<p>hormones it&rsquo;s a matter of voiding this</p>
<p>one hormone right here called insulin</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why if you just get the sugar</p>
<p>out of the diet you are going to lose</p>
<p>weight okay</p>
<p>so you probably already know that you</p>
<p>probably ever experienced that so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing but here&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>that is even more fascinating</p>
<p>traditional diets and exercise really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work for belly fat this is because</p>
<p>belly fat is a different type of problem</p>
<p>and so you may have lost weight</p>
<p>lowering insulin but you definitely have</p>
<p>not lost very much belly fat with</p>
<p>lowering insulin with your diet because</p>
<p>cortisol is another hormone that is</p>
<p>dominating so cortisol is the dominating</p>
<p>hormone - and cortisol will pretty much</p>
<p>nullify blockout cancel all the fat</p>
<p>burning hormones as well so you have</p>
<p>these two hormones you have sugar and</p>
<p>stress those are the two deadly</p>
<p>combinations okay there is one more -</p>
<p>but but I&rsquo;m not going to get into it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s estrogen if you wanted to know</p>
<p>estrogen will also dominate but not as</p>
<p>powerfully as cortisol or insulin but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the other interesting thing if</p>
<p>you cut out the sugar and you still</p>
<p>crave and we know the cortisol is</p>
<p>turning your protein your muscles into</p>
<p>sugar so your the adrenal hormones can</p>
<p>make it so your sugar is still high in</p>
<p>blocking fat burning from the stress why</p>
<p>do you think you crave sweets we under</p>
<p>stress so when you stress your body</p>
<p>needs quick energy so cortisol is a</p>
<p>dominating quantum so most people</p>
<p>mistakenly focus on trying to trigger</p>
<p>the papen hormones when it&rsquo;s a thousand</p>
<p>times more important to avoid the fat</p>
<p>dominating or fat making dominating</p>
<p>hormones so so it&rsquo;s all about avoiding</p>
<p>stress and about avoiding sugar right so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you some things to do</p>
<p>but I want to just mention one thing</p>
<p>about you know people always want to</p>
<p>balance their hormones that is not a</p>
<p>good idea why because we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>insulin to be too high or cortisol to be</p>
<p>too high we want your body is out of</p>
<p>balance so you can&rsquo;t go on a balanced</p>
<p>diet you can&rsquo;t go on a balanced hormonal</p>
<p>you know program you need to understand</p>
<p>that we want to lower insulin cortisol</p>
<p>and estrogen and increase the other</p>
<p>hormones and this whole concept of</p>
<p>everything in moderation is a bad idea</p>
<p>because all you&rsquo;re going to do is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to maintain your fatness</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to lose weight so I</p>
<p>wanted to bring that point out so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to recommend right</p>
<p>now I want you to focus all your efforts</p>
<p>only on supporting the adrenals not the</p>
<p>weight forget about the weight the</p>
<p>weight will come off as a by-product</p>
<p>after the adrenal body type is improved</p>
<p>okay does that make sense so how do we</p>
<p>lower cortisol I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>some small but crucial actions these are</p>
<p>easy things that you can do you can</p>
<p>start implementing them right away and</p>
<p>you just need to focus on them these are</p>
<p>the most important things number one</p>
<p>thing is this sleep you must fix the</p>
<p>sleep out of anything if you are</p>
<p>sleeping and and you&rsquo;re not eating sugar</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretentious now you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>lose weight a lot better but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not sleeping no matter what you do I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re exercising it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to work because the sleep is one</p>
<p>powerful thing to lower cortisol in fact</p>
<p>if I were just to you know weigh out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s more important exercise or sleep</p>
<p>guess what it&rsquo;s going to be sleep</p>
<p>hands-down ten times more effective if</p>
<p>you sleep than if you exercise when but</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>probably get up early and forget your</p>
<p>sleep and keep trying to burn off those</p>
<p>calories it&rsquo;s not going to work</p>
<p>look at these hormones you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>burn all the fat at night okay not</p>
<p>during the day so I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>one technique that that I do let me just</p>
<p>kind of pull up my computer here okay so</p>
<p>this is a device that I use to do it</p>
<p>yourself device and there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tripod boom boom boom and they have</p>
<p>different widths okay and this is used</p>
<p>as a replica of my hand okay I built</p>
<p>this for myself</p>
<p>you can take it you can place it in the</p>
<p>back of your neck right here and you can</p>
<p>lean back right here and hit these</p>
<p>points there are two points right in the</p>
<p>back of your neck that if you press on</p>
<p>these points you can you can get some</p>
<p>serious improvement you can get with</p>
<p>your sleep you can turn off a lot of</p>
<p>stress you can also take your hands with</p>
<p>your thumbs and press over through here</p>
<p>and lean back and press on those points</p>
<p>as well and this is just a real simple</p>
<p>little technique that you can do that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you what I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend to be able to use this to</p>
<p>reduce stress okay let me come back to</p>
<p>my powerpoint presentation which is out</p>
<p>of order again okay here we go right</p>
<p>here now you get a tall back chair you</p>
<p>get a um a couch and you take the widest</p>
<p>points and you put it right in the back</p>
<p>of your right underneath your skull</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two points there that stimulate</p>
<p>the off switch on the nervous system it</p>
<p>will create a full body relaxation</p>
<p>through the entire spine and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>sleep very deeply if you do this so this</p>
<p>is one little technique that I use for</p>
<p>stress because it&rsquo;s a manual technique</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically physically taking</p>
<p>parts of your body and pressing</p>
<p>different parts to release stress and</p>
<p>this is a very important one that I use</p>
<p>for sleep okay so that&rsquo;s one one thing</p>
<p>the other thing is that you your sleep</p>
<p>cycle starts at about 10:30 or 10:00</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>10:30 you need to be in bed by like</p>
<p>10:15 or 10:30 to catch the first wave</p>
<p>if you go to sleep past well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty much screwed you will you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be able to catch that up because the</p>
<p>hormones work on these waves for ninety</p>
<p>minutes sleep cycles so you want to</p>
<p>catch the way be in the bed a little</p>
<p>earlier and catch that first way</p>
<p>and this is interesting all the benefits</p>
<p>of exercise occur in deep sleep all the</p>
<p>benefits of exercise occur in the deep</p>
<p>sleep about 24 to 48 hours after you</p>
<p>workout so when you&rsquo;re burning let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you did it to our workout and you</p>
<p>weighed yourself before and after it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be zero but if you weigh yourself the</p>
<p>next day or 48 hours later you weight</p>
<p>less because the benefit of exercise is</p>
<p>delayed during the exercise itself all</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re stressing the</p>
<p>body out so it&rsquo;s all about the recovery</p>
<p>after that&rsquo;s why when you measure people</p>
<p>and their low recovery you have to fix</p>
<p>the recovery because they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>lose weight interesting number two this</p>
<p>is huge</p>
<p>uhm do people stress you out yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two types of people there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that bring you up and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that bring you down and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what a person does to your</p>
<p>communication do they twist what you</p>
<p>said do they alter what you said do the</p>
<p>ignore your communication do they fail</p>
<p>to acknowledge what you said see when</p>
<p>you have two people husband and wife</p>
<p>friends family members the goal is for</p>
<p>someone to say something maybe an upset</p>
<p>and the other person to receive that and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a battery it discharges that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that pressure that stress but if that</p>
<p>person is unwilling to listen as a</p>
<p>therapy then the person is going to</p>
<p>build up stress so it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>not to try to help people too much and</p>
<p>give them advice instead listening and</p>
<p>acknowledging and being interested is</p>
<p>probably the best thing you can do to</p>
<p>reduce stress in people but no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing that they want to not listen to</p>
<p>the stress they don&rsquo;t want the person to</p>
<p>communicate anymore so either alter the</p>
<p>stress they invalidate they make the</p>
<p>person wrong um like the person has a</p>
<p>complaint that person said no no you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just making things up or they evaluate</p>
<p>you know let&rsquo;s say you know your problem</p>
<p>is blah blah blah so really it</p>
<p>communication is</p>
<p>is it could be used as a tool or a</p>
<p>weapon and and the thing is that if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running into these personality</p>
<p>types that are doing this to you either</p>
<p>you can have to handle them or kind of</p>
<p>just avoid them because try to fix the</p>
<p>adrenals in this pressure cooker</p>
<p>environment it&rsquo;s really tough um so you</p>
<p>want to pick your friends your family</p>
<p>very wisely right your coworker</p>
<p>put your boss okay what happens when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re under stress is you lose this one</p>
<p>thing called</p>
<p>space your space comes in on you</p>
<p>I mean look look what happens look at</p>
<p>this and look at this can you see the</p>
<p>space where this guy is and see the</p>
<p>space over here she has a lot of space</p>
<p>what happens when you get space is all</p>
<p>that stress can move off your body and</p>
<p>your Drina glands get happier and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why people can go on a vacation or go in</p>
<p>a different location maybe go hiking and</p>
<p>the stress goes way down if you go from</p>
<p>your office to the gym on a treadmill</p>
<p>and watch TV and go home that is not</p>
<p>good for the adrenals the best exercise</p>
<p>the best therapy for the adrenal is to</p>
<p>go somewhere to get space what workout</p>
<p>am i doing now basically I go outside in</p>
<p>my backyard and I chop wood I love doing</p>
<p>that it gets my attention off things I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lifting things I&rsquo;m looking at things I</p>
<p>am not on a treadmill so I ride my bike</p>
<p>I so I always try to get space go for</p>
<p>long walks but the best exercise for the</p>
<p>dream is not a high intensity at first</p>
<p>they have to do long walks and just</p>
<p>looking at stuff not with the headphones</p>
<p>just getting space because look at this</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my great graphic design here you</p>
<p>are thinking about all these problems</p>
<p>24/7 guess what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>triggering the adrenals because they</p>
<p>react to mental stress constantly so we</p>
<p>need to get your attention out of your</p>
<p>head and out into the environment</p>
<p>okay very important very subtle very</p>
<p>simple but you need to do that</p>
<p>number three food stresses now here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something interesting you might think</p>
<p>that um you know you&rsquo;re a stress eater</p>
<p>and you eat this junk food it lowers</p>
<p>your stress it really doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>junk food does not lower stress it</p>
<p>increases body stress I guarantee you</p>
<p>eat that cake and about I&rsquo;d say about I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know about three minutes later</p>
<p>four minutes later five minutes later</p>
<p>j√∂rgen is field stress start building up</p>
<p>because your blood Sugar&rsquo;s have crashed</p>
<p>they went up in then went down and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting irritable more stressed</p>
<p>out so these so-called junk foods</p>
<p>actually add more stress so it&rsquo;s a trap</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a little bit of pleasure</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s like a drug do drugs make you</p>
<p>better temporarily they make you feel</p>
<p>better but they don&rsquo;t so this is a total</p>
<p>trap that people are in so what do you</p>
<p>do you avoid the sugars and the hidden</p>
<p>sugars so then the cravings go away and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about fruit so fruit is not</p>
<p>a problem to maintain white fruit</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t increase weight gain but</p>
<p>it definitely prevents the loss of it</p>
<p>grains especially oatmeal breads pasta</p>
<p>cereal crackers biscuits waffles</p>
<p>pancakes those are all things that stop</p>
<p>weight loss yogurt even plane has the</p>
<p>hidden sugars it&rsquo;s like six to 10 grams</p>
<p>look start reading the label under the</p>
<p>sugar grams and you&rsquo;ll see alcohol turns</p>
<p>into sugar I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>but if you if you actually drink alcohol</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to have to be okay</p>
<p>with not burning fat for one to two days</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to block that burning</p>
<p>so just be aware of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and be okay with it</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m just I&rsquo;m just pointing your</p>
<p>attention on work what&rsquo;s making you</p>
<p>stressed out okay I mean look at an</p>
<p>apple when I look at ingredients I</p>
<p>always look at this one thing down here</p>
<p>not the total carbohydrate that the</p>
<p>total sugars 19 grams</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like eating a candy bar you</p>
<p>should have this at zero or less than</p>
<p>119 grams crazy so there are things you</p>
<p>can eat that substitute for the things</p>
<p>that you crave in my membership site I</p>
<p>give you recipes of things like some of</p>
<p>these are on my website some of these</p>
<p>are not but this is like a healthy</p>
<p>granola this is a peanut butter cup this</p>
<p>is a bread that has no flour cookie that</p>
<p>has no flour no sugar ice cream there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no sugar this is like almond joy</p>
<p>substitute no sugar these here you could</p>
<p>do these things so you keep in the</p>
<p>refrigerator that way you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re deprived and you just can do</p>
<p>a long-term here&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting synthetic vitamin C most</p>
<p>vitamin C out there soul is made</p>
<p>synthetically from corn starch which by</p>
<p>the way has no vitamin C in sulfuric</p>
<p>acid and they mix the two together and</p>
<p>they make ascorbic acid and they sell it</p>
<p>as vitamin C well ascorbic acid is one</p>
<p>little tiny portion of the vitamin C</p>
<p>complex and if it&rsquo;s made artificially</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the real thing</p>
<p>so because the adrenal gland stores most</p>
<p>of Ottoman C in the body because you</p>
<p>need the vitamin C to convert into</p>
<p>adrenal hormones if you take synthetic C</p>
<p>it will deplete the other factors in the</p>
<p>vitamin C complex they&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>make hormones and it will weaken the</p>
<p>adrenals so taking it like anything over</p>
<p>a hundred milligrams 500 milligrams of</p>
<p>vitamin C and your synthetic vitamins is</p>
<p>not a good idea for the adrenals</p>
<p>especially if you take grams ye I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>people worse than adrenals by taking</p>
<p>synthetic vitamin C</p>
<p>and by the way there is no vitamin C in</p>
<p>orange juice why because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pasteurized and there&rsquo;s two things it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>destroyed vitamin C one is heat and the</p>
<p>other is oxygen so and even if you did</p>
<p>drink orange juice it&rsquo;s just like sugar</p>
<p>water and the reason why they can claim</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vitamin C is because they legalized</p>
<p>synthetic vitamin C to be vitamin C and</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t really differentiate</p>
<p>between synthetic and whole food vitamin</p>
<p>C let&rsquo;s just take a look at vitamin C</p>
<p>where it and come from bell peppers oh</p>
<p>my gosh that&rsquo;s a lot of vitamin C Kiwi</p>
<p>kale strawberries papaya broccoli</p>
<p>oranges I want to just actually are low</p>
<p>on the vitamin C complex I like to get</p>
<p>my vitamin C from bell peppers or kale</p>
<p>all right here&rsquo;s the other nutrient out</p>
<p>of all the nutrients potassium is the</p>
<p>single most important nutrient for the</p>
<p>nervous system for the adrenals why</p>
<p>because when you have an overactive</p>
<p>adrenal you deplete your potassium and</p>
<p>then if you deplete your potassium you</p>
<p>basically you get nervous your muscles</p>
<p>cramp up your adrenals can&rsquo;t calm down</p>
<p>potassium is a physiological</p>
<p>tranquilizer it calms you down and you</p>
<p>need like 4700 milligrams a day no one</p>
<p>gets that you say well I eat a banana a</p>
<p>day that&rsquo;s 300 milligrams you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>have eight bananas or</p>
<p>one-two-three-four-five avocados every</p>
<p>single day to get your potassium okay so</p>
<p>I recommend some other things instead of</p>
<p>getting that and I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p>
<p>getting it from salad all right sell it</p>
<p>so let me just show you something here</p>
<p>check this out this is my salad okay you</p>
<p>need about I&rsquo;d say about seven to ten</p>
<p>cups of salad every single day to get</p>
<p>your potassium but you don&rsquo;t just get</p>
<p>your potassium to get all you could</p>
<p>divide it and see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we want to go with the</p>
<p>vegetables now this looks pretty big</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m holding in</p>
<p>front of me but if I hold it right here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more doable say that big as my</p>
<p>head but look at this this is seven cups</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fluffed it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>packed down I do 10 cups this is how</p>
<p>much I eat and I give them they actually</p>
<p>do a little bit more than this but you</p>
<p>need to do a minimum but look at the</p>
<p>type of salad I use so serious it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just ice berg this has a lot of</p>
<p>different now where do I get my salad I</p>
<p>go to the farmers market</p>
<p>why because I had a friend that lived in</p>
<p>Russia and I notice every time he came</p>
<p>to America he got fat and he a lot of</p>
<p>salad eat a lot of vegetables but back</p>
<p>home</p>
<p>he said his salad and his vegetables</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so much more tastier</p>
<p>more nutritious and he loses weight on</p>
<p>them um because they&rsquo;re nutrient dense</p>
<p>like we have cellar that&rsquo;s empty</p>
<p>so you minimally need to go get it from</p>
<p>the healthy store not 7-eleven don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>your sell it from 7-eleven or shoppers</p>
<p>maybe maybe they might have organic but</p>
<p>if you could go to the farmers market</p>
<p>and get your vegetables you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get on much higher quality and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get you can get these mixed</p>
<p>lettuce leaves right here and this will</p>
<p>give you that healthy glow I&rsquo;m 50 years</p>
<p>old and I know that the more of this I</p>
<p>eat I just I just look younger and</p>
<p>younger and so you want to start</p>
<p>consuming healthy things but most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough vegetable in their</p>
<p>diet they have this little cell and</p>
<p>intellect vegetables you can actually</p>
<p>even blend this with maybe like a couple</p>
<p>of berries with water blend this and</p>
<p>make and drink your salad but you need</p>
<p>to start adding salads to your diet now</p>
<p>I also use a salad scissors now you can</p>
<p>see them in two knives right so I will</p>
<p>chop this salad right here and make it</p>
<p>like half of this thing so I can eat it</p>
<p>and if you get bloated well then have</p>
<p>another type of vegetable if you get</p>
<p>bloated like do maybe a spring green or</p>
<p>something like that or you need to fix</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>to be able to digest all that and I just</p>
<p>remembered I my wife and I make</p>
<p>different things every single week we</p>
<p>make things for the whole week that are</p>
<p>kind of like healthy comfort foods we</p>
<p>pour a granola bar without all the crap</p>
<p>but this week we made something called</p>
<p>almond bread I want to show you this</p>
<p>right here this is made with sesame</p>
<p>seeds and um onions this stuff is</p>
<p>freaking amazing with soy sauce but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>organic it&rsquo;s Bragg&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s salty chip and</p>
<p>these are delicious and we made these in</p>
<p>a dehydrator and they&rsquo;re real easy so</p>
<p>the member should try to give you the</p>
<p>recipe for all these things and a lot</p>
<p>more and each week we create another one</p>
<p>but these are things that you should</p>
<p>prepare for the week and then that way</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to think about it okay so</p>
<p>let me go back to the slide right here</p>
<p>okay so increase your potassium rich</p>
<p>food I don&rsquo;t recommend taking in a</p>
<p>supplement unless it&rsquo;s a food base it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t create the same effect I mean when</p>
<p>you lose weight you wanna you want to</p>
<p>lose and healthily you know um now</p>
<p>number six only have a protein breakfast</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re looking at my egg oil oh my</p>
<p>gosh that&rsquo;s gonna increase my</p>
<p>cholesterol not if you&rsquo;re not doing the</p>
<p>carbs it won&rsquo;t um I do grass-fed bacon</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>in fact I&rsquo;m you don&rsquo;t have to do it you</p>
<p>can do tricky bacon you don&rsquo;t do baking</p>
<p>it all but I I consume that and these</p>
<p>pigs are way way healthier than chicken</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that right now because eat</p>
<p>grass and they it&rsquo;s a little bit of</p>
<p>different taste but that&rsquo;s just what I</p>
<p>do so you want a protein maybe some</p>
<p>avocado maybe some vegetable but mainly</p>
<p>protein fat breakfast because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to actually establish your bless</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>the whole day and you will feel so much</p>
<p>better okay</p>
<p>very important for the adrenals okay so</p>
<p>now are you ready for some serious</p>
<p>results because I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>this membership site that I basically</p>
<p>created over the last three months so</p>
<p>you really have two choices plan a you</p>
<p>could come to my office and let us do</p>
<p>the evaluation and and work on you and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the ideal scene but if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t live locally Plan B I created</p>
<p>it to do it yourself it&rsquo;s adrenal body</p>
<p>type exclusive membership and in this</p>
<p>membership I basically show you all the</p>
<p>advanced techniques on the endocrine</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s what we do to help people</p>
<p>take them to the next level it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>goes way beyond weight loss because</p>
<p>there is one two three four five six</p>
<p>different sections there&rsquo;s a section</p>
<p>called one thing at a time and basically</p>
<p>there are a hundred and thirty-eight</p>
<p>videos 98% of these videos are not on</p>
<p>YouTube or my website you can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>them so it&rsquo;s especially created for this</p>
<p>portal but you start off on the left and</p>
<p>you go to the right and what you can do</p>
<p>is you can add one technique at a time</p>
<p>and implement it they&rsquo;re short to the</p>
<p>point videos really simple and you start</p>
<p>implementing one thing at a time at your</p>
<p>own pace and we basically show you what</p>
<p>to eat what not to eat help you</p>
<p>understand how to burn fat what to do</p>
<p>what not to do so that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>section sex the second section is called</p>
<p>barrier and situations and in that</p>
<p>section we cover something that I</p>
<p>surveyed 900 of my clients and people</p>
<p>are on my list and I the number one</p>
<p>thing that I found is that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stick to a program because they have low</p>
<p>willpower well in truth it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>low willpower</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that either they don&rsquo;t get results</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t have tools to overcome all</p>
<p>the temptation</p>
<p>and what to do at a restaurant what to</p>
<p>do in stress eating what are you bored</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating out of boredom so I</p>
<p>take every single possible situation and</p>
<p>I show you how to solve it so you can</p>
<p>stick to things a lot longer I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>lot longer I mean forever because the</p>
<p>next section is going to be substitute</p>
<p>pleasure foods and we&rsquo;re going to show</p>
<p>you amazing recipes that you can create</p>
<p>every single week to have in your house</p>
<p>to replace the junk we&rsquo;re getting the</p>
<p>junk on the trunk and replacing with</p>
<p>some good stuff and the you&rsquo;ll get the</p>
<p>same pleasure but without the sugar or</p>
<p>the bad stuff and every week I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to be adding more recipes more amazing</p>
<p>snacks more content so this is just</p>
<p>going to help motivate you and keep you</p>
<p>going</p>
<p>now don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed by 138 videos</p>
<p>because um you&rsquo;re going to go to the</p>
<p>videos that pertain to you and you might</p>
<p>not have a problem with certain things</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s why I wanted to talk</p>
<p>about the next section which is</p>
<p>basically body problems solved</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to fix all the weak</p>
<p>links in the body and I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only as strong as your weakest</p>
<p>link you might have inflammation you</p>
<p>might have a heavy period might have hot</p>
<p>flashes constipation bloating sleep</p>
<p>problems these other note like so called</p>
<p>non weight related things must be fixed</p>
<p>in this section I show you how to fix</p>
<p>them I show you how to evaluate then the</p>
<p>next one is real-life case studies and</p>
<p>we up this and update this on a regular</p>
<p>basis the thing I like about this is</p>
<p>that you can watch real live examples of</p>
<p>my own clients in my office outside my</p>
<p>office and we video all the successful</p>
<p>actions that they have done but you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see one lady who lost four pounds in a</p>
<p>week and what we did after not losing</p>
<p>any weight for a long time so it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like a debug and explaining um you</p>
<p>know people&rsquo;s mistakes you can learn</p>
<p>from other people and how we took a lady</p>
<p>who are blood Sugar&rsquo;s were over 200 down</p>
<p>to 106 in one week so it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>and the last one is</p>
<p>the most important advanced techniques I</p>
<p>do not recommend looking at that Ralph</p>
<p>that because you need to get the basics</p>
<p>in first but these are all the</p>
<p>acupressure techniques that are way</p>
<p>beyond just the weight loss this is</p>
<p>about extracting stress it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>working on the different endocrine</p>
<p>glands naturally and manually you with</p>
<p>some of them you do need help from</p>
<p>another person and your spouse or a</p>
<p>friend or if I have family member but a</p>
<p>lot of them you can do on yourself um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also going to learn how to get</p>
<p>rid of old injuries and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>like that so this will give you the</p>
<p>unfair advantage the only thing about</p>
<p>getting access to this membership is</p>
<p>that you have to agree not to teach any</p>
<p>of my materials okay because I&rsquo;m giving</p>
<p>this to you added is it&rsquo;s an off at</p>
<p>discount rate and the last thing I want</p>
<p>to do is is have people take my</p>
<p>information and teach it you can use it</p>
<p>for yourself for your family for your</p>
<p>friends but you can&rsquo;t teach it okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two people right now two doctors</p>
<p>that I ended up successively suing</p>
<p>because they did take my information and</p>
<p>they started teaching it without my</p>
<p>permission so I want to protect it</p>
<p>because people will alter it and you</p>
<p>never know and I know that&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be healed but I just you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna have to agree that you won&rsquo;t teach</p>
<p>it okay two goals one is to get your</p>
<p>lifestyles squared away and all your</p>
<p>habits grooved in so you can do this</p>
<p>long term but then the other thing is to</p>
<p>get the body working right to fix the</p>
<p>body so you can burn more fat so this</p>
<p>exclusive membership you&rsquo;ll have access</p>
<p>to the advanced techniques for the Drina</p>
<p>body type and all others and you get</p>
<p>access to me personally like I answer</p>
<p>the questions the only thing I ask is</p>
<p>that like when people ask a question</p>
<p>sometimes they might say I can&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>weight what do I do or they give me a</p>
<p>whole book of questions in their history</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that kind of goes beyond this</p>
<p>this portal I&rsquo;m talking like a quick</p>
<p>question a very specific question with</p>
<p>the background let&rsquo;s say my cholesterol</p>
<p>is this I&rsquo;ve done this what do I do if</p>
<p>this is work</p>
<p>because in order to evaluate I need I</p>
<p>need more information but it has to be</p>
<p>like a quick question and answer because</p>
<p>that because at this level you know be</p>
<p>happy to just to check you know answer</p>
<p>any questions if they&rsquo;re quick and easy</p>
<p>not a problem and I check it daily so I</p>
<p>will be looking at this a lot more than</p>
<p>other like my blog or on the YouTube</p>
<p>comments</p>
<p>etc so you have access to me directly</p>
<p>of course I show you what to eat and I</p>
<p>show you what to do and I explain um you</p>
<p>know give you options for your habits</p>
<p>and things but I&rsquo;m going to give you</p>
<p>strategies and then each month you will</p>
<p>get something really cool I have a</p>
<p>series of booklets that I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>called beyond symptoms series and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get access to that before anyone gets</p>
<p>access to it and each week will add more</p>
<p>and more things okay what is the</p>
<p>investment what&rsquo;s the cost it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be 299 bucks it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>even be 199 or even 99 it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>only $36 a month there is a three month</p>
<p>minimum now you have to get three months</p>
<p>in advance to do this and that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>you one month is not going to be enough</p>
<p>to fix all these issues you have to give</p>
<p>it at least three months or longer to be</p>
<p>able to fix these issues now there is</p>
<p>another option you can get it less</p>
<p>expensive for eighteen dollars a month</p>
<p>but you would have to also prepay for</p>
<p>the whole year okay so those are the two</p>
<p>options 36 or 18 a month one is the</p>
<p>three month minimum the next is an $18</p>
<p>minimum so let me just show you where</p>
<p>you can do this here so I think you can</p>
<p>this offer right here yeah I think you</p>
<p>can see it if not you can look below and</p>
<p>there should be a link but if you click</p>
<p>on the adrenal body type advanced</p>
<p>membership Add to Cart you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>go into let me see if I could I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you the link to so you can go here and</p>
<p>choose your options I think this is</p>
<p>working</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t okay should work okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>here yeah it should work you should see</p>
<p>the link to go get this program now I</p>
<p>want to show you something right here we</p>
<p>go back to this portal right here it</p>
<p>bumped me out again okay let&rsquo;s see if I</p>
<p>go right here this is what I want to</p>
<p>share with you okay now here&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the other thing that I want to</p>
<p>mention if you&rsquo;re not a hundred percent</p>
<p>satisfied get a refund okay so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>letting you know there&rsquo;s no risk to you</p>
<p>at all there&rsquo;s a 30-day money-back</p>
<p>guarantee if you&rsquo;re not totally thrilled</p>
<p>you can get a refund so there&rsquo;s no risk</p>
<p>so you definitely um it&rsquo;s a great deal</p>
<p>okay because here&rsquo;s the thing the most</p>
<p>important thing I think beyond the</p>
<p>eating and and all the other things is</p>
<p>the advanced techniques because it</p>
<p>handles the cortisol and you cannot</p>
<p>learn this anywhere no one&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>no weight loss program focuses on the</p>
<p>stress piece at all and there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>other things if you want to get this</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m going to give you two bonuses</p>
<p>one is unlimited access to my meal</p>
<p>creator software and you&rsquo;ll get that for</p>
<p>free and it&rsquo;s really cool because if you</p>
<p>were to try to do a program and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to create a meals and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually organizing or</p>
<p>planning out your meals for the week and</p>
<p>like you go day-to-day it won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because by Wednesday if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the right meal to the right food in your</p>
<p>house guess what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go off the program so</p>
<p>this allows you to quickly select the</p>
<p>foods that you like and press enter and</p>
<p>create a weekly meal plan you print it</p>
<p>out put it on your refrigerator it also</p>
<p>gives you other recipes so now you have</p>
<p>a plan you take this to the grocery</p>
<p>store you can check it out and you will</p>
<p>have unlimited um access to this meal</p>
<p>crater plan and it&rsquo;s really cool it</p>
<p>allows people to stick to things a lot</p>
<p>easier and it&rsquo;s part of the bonus if you</p>
<p>get this thing today and there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>more really cool bonus that I have to</p>
<p>share with you I&rsquo;ve been working the</p>
<p>last six months on it some advanced</p>
<p>evaluation software and you will be able</p>
<p>to take this quiz once a month it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>complex it&rsquo;s very deep and I wanted to</p>
<p>show you what it looks like hopefully I</p>
<p>can show you what it looks like um by</p>
<p>giving you let&rsquo;s see if I could find it</p>
<p>let me see right here okay</p>
<p>be able to show you this let me see here</p>
<p>hopefully yes I think hmm you gotta see</p>
<p>this um let&rsquo;s see here here&rsquo;s my this is</p>
<p>a this is the back end of software and</p>
<p>let me just see where it is so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to just see if you could see this here</p>
<p>now hmm okay that&rsquo;s fine I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>show you okay it&rsquo;s not popping up here</p>
<p>for some reason um unfortunately but</p>
<p>what I did is I took every single</p>
<p>symptom you could imagine acne hair loss</p>
<p>bitching I took every single symptom and</p>
<p>I typed out every single possible cause</p>
<p>for that symptom and then I typed all</p>
<p>the common causes and all their symptoms</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem with evaluation</p>
<p>is that you have symptoms and your</p>
<p>causes and you know causes you know</p>
<p>symptoms back this can be very confusing</p>
<p>and I basically consolidated all this</p>
<p>information into some logic that I use</p>
<p>without even knowing I was using it I</p>
<p>put it together and I digitized it so</p>
<p>when you fill out this it&rsquo;s a long quiz</p>
<p>it will evaluate your data and find your</p>
<p>real cause and it tells you what to do</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very cool and if you were to go</p>
<p>ahead and take this and then each month</p>
<p>take it and you have less and less</p>
<p>symptoms you can actually get better</p>
<p>over time so that evaluation software is</p>
<p>included as a bonus if you want to get</p>
<p>this today</p>
<p>a couple questions that people always</p>
<p>ask me about this will this be available</p>
<p>later if I decide to do it later</p>
<p>absolutely you just won&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>bonuses okay why do I have to do a</p>
<p>prepay because it takes at least three</p>
<p>months to be able to apply this and</p>
<p>actually um see some major results one</p>
<p>month is not going to cut it and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving you everything but the kitchen</p>
<p>sink I&rsquo;m giving you everything in this</p>
<p>portal so you&rsquo;ll be able to learn the</p>
<p>advanced techniques which you might not</p>
<p>realize it yet but uh these are the</p>
<p>techniques that I help people drop their</p>
<p>sugars in 80 points in 30 minutes from</p>
<p>doing these bodywork I&rsquo;ve had other</p>
<p>people get their temperature back in</p>
<p>this massive weight I had one lady she</p>
<p>um she heard I was perfect I mean it was</p>
<p>better than mine and she basically her</p>
<p>problem was she didn&rsquo;t sleep first</p>
<p>treatment we did the advanced technique</p>
<p>on and she slept for I think 13 hours</p>
<p>the next two weeks she lost more weight</p>
<p>in two weeks she&rsquo;d she did for the last</p>
<p>two years from the sleep so it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>restoring the inside of the body so you</p>
<p>can get your body back and whatever your</p>
<p>barrier is we we fix it</p>
<p>and the other thing is that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be adding a lot more content as we go</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s my basically communication</p>
<p>portal my platform sort of speak with</p>
<p>you so we can go back and forth and work</p>
<p>on you remotely it&rsquo;s the best way that</p>
<p>do this without having to physically</p>
<p>come in my office you can come to my</p>
<p>office too and not a problem and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you can even come for a free evaluation</p>
<p>I charge for my evaluations if you want</p>
<p>to see me for my first evaluation so 150</p>
<p>but you can get an evaluation from one</p>
<p>of my practitioners for free okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how that works</p>
<p>but anyway I want to thank you so much</p>
<p>for your attention</p>
<p>in this webinar I want you to seriously</p>
<p>consider doing the portal and also all</p>
<p>the other tips that I recommend I want</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>to apply those as well because this is</p>
<p>the year that you need to get your body</p>
<p>back and do it in a healthy way and look</p>
<p>at the whole picture and the next time</p>
<p>someone comes up to you and basically</p>
<p>tries to stress you out now you know</p>
<p>exactly what they&rsquo;re doing with your</p>
<p>communication so you can start to avoid</p>
<p>stress with people with food with the</p>
<p>type of exercise you should do to</p>
<p>enhance your sleep and those things so I</p>
<p>want to thank you and I&rsquo;ll see you on</p>
<p>the inside of my portal very soon</p>
