<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a Friday morning for those of</p>
<p>you that are on the east coast of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a lot of other people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the middle of the night but we</p>
<p>have people from all over the world uh</p>

<p>have any questions go ahead and ask away</p>

<p>um it&rsquo;s water soluble so you can take it</p>
<p>on an empty stomach so you can take it</p>
<p>in the morning or at night but you know</p>
<p>sometimes I mean if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creates that flushing response and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right before bed maybe that might</p>
<p>not be the best idea but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not important when you take it actually</p>
<p>all right very good well we&rsquo;ve got uh</p>
<p>coming up Andrew in a bit I was going to</p>
<p>talk about his wife&rsquo;s bloating so why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we talk about bloating early from</p>
<p>social media Sandy from YouTube what can</p>
<p>I do about bloating it seems everything</p>
<p>I eat contributes to bloating I cannot</p>
<p>lose my belly fat even though I have</p>
<p>lost 80 pounds good for you so far on a</p>
<p>strict keto I do take bile salts</p>
<p>probiotics and apple cider vinegar what</p>
<p>do you think doc</p>
<p>well all those are really good things</p>
<p>but the most important thing is to</p>
<p>realize that the bloating actually is in</p>
<p>your digestive system which means it</p>
<p>involves food which means the most</p>
<p>important thing to do is to you have to</p>
<p>figure out what is bloating you and then</p>
<p>avoid it</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s usually just kind of like</p>
<p>cutting things out but I can give you</p>
<p>the most common reasons why people bloat</p>
<p>if you think about what bloating is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a gas and it comes from the microbes</p>
<p>eating certain things and it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>fermentation so it&rsquo;s fermenting just</p>
<p>like you would see bread Rising if you</p>
<p>add yeast or those little bubbly things</p>
<p>in champagne or beer that&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>microbes eating something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating this gas sanding in your gut so</p>
<p>we have a problem with fermentation</p>
<p>and chances are you&rsquo;re feeding too much</p>
<p>of the wrong thing so what these</p>
<p>microbes live on are called I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever heard this before Steve</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>carbohydrates have you ever heard of</p>
<p>that never heard of it</p>
<p>yeah so carbohydrates are really a</p>
<p>combination of the sugar</p>
<p>the fiber and the starch so all three of</p>
<p>those can be great food for microbes so</p>
<p>what you want to do is um cut down those</p>
<p>um so like definitely the the low</p>
<p>hanging fruit would be omit the fruit</p>
<p>amid the grains the beans things like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like especially like the Breads and</p>
<p>pastas and Swirls and things like that</p>
<p>and sugars but also like the sugar</p>
<p>alcohols like um the so-called healthy</p>
<p>keto friendly but they&rsquo;re not bloat</p>
<p>friendly you have um like the maltitol</p>
<p>the Xylitol the erythritol the Mannitol</p>
<p>all the talls</p>
<p>um not good if you have uh bloating they</p>
<p>will blow you more because they&rsquo;re sugar</p>
<p>alcohols and all these new newfangled uh</p>
<p>functional fibers like the soluble corn</p>
<p>fiber and the tapioca fiber and the</p>
<p>polydactros all this all these funny new</p>
<p>names that they&rsquo;re putting out in a lot</p>
<p>of the ingredients and they say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fibroids but they&rsquo;re manufactured your</p>
<p>body is going to blow from them so you</p>
<p>got to be careful of those and then you</p>
<p>also have the prebiotics right you uh</p>
<p>the so-called healthy prebox because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all in the like the super greens</p>
<p>product the superfoods and the</p>
<p>plant-based proteins they put these</p>
<p>prebiotics and that would be like inulin</p>
<p>um gather certain seeds certain fibers</p>
<p>that will bloat you so you gotta avoid</p>
<p>those unfortunately so you just you need</p>
<p>to isolate like when does blowing start</p>
<p>okay what did I just eat and maybe start</p>
<p>cutting down uh vegetables too but</p>
<p>usually if you cook your vegetables or</p>
<p>consume like the fermented ones like</p>
<p>sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be better off or even you cook</p>
<p>them or just reduce them that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help you I personally cannot digest</p>
<p>broccoli for some reason I bloat like</p>
<p>crazy but I can do cabbage other people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do cabbage so you want to just</p>
<p>isolate what it is that is bloating you</p>
<p>and then avoid it and then start doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I tell you what I&rsquo;ll just create a video</p>
<p>on this real this next week so you could</p>
<p>uh get the full scoop but boy if you</p>
<p>just know these basic things you can</p>
<p>avoid a lot of misery I used to have</p>
<p>bloating for years and I didn&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>would be taking remedies and take</p>
<p>antacids and</p>
<p>over the counter medication so it was</p>
<p>like going in the wrong direction really</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>all right so uh anyway uh bloating</p>
<p>bloating here&rsquo;s Malcolm X from YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really underweight now see that</p>
<p>makes me mad I would love to be</p>
<p>underweight but he says how many grams</p>
<p>of carbs should I be eating without</p>
<p>worrying about increases in my blood</p>
<p>sugar levels and insulin resistance</p>
<p>the magic number is 50 net carbs so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go over 50 net carbs so that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re minusing the fiber</p>
<p>um in some of the foods but when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about leafy green vegetables and</p>
<p>salads</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t even count those you can eat we</p>
<p>want you to have more of those unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bloater and you have some</p>
<p>issues with that so</p>
<p>um the magic number is 50 grams or less</p>
<p>net carbs</p>
<p>all right very good go Malcolm let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Tanya from London uh her name is</p>
<p>actually Tanya from London from YouTube</p>
<p>please share your advice on how to clear</p>
<p>up a bladder infection after having</p>
<p>kidney stone</p>
<p>laser surgery I&rsquo;m starting on healthy</p>
<p>keto tomorrow I guess she&rsquo;s left with a</p>
<p>bladder infection</p>
<p>one really good remedy is to take</p>
<p>something called methylene blue okay</p>
<p>take it in the morning 20 drops in a</p>
<p>glass of water it doesn&rsquo;t taste good so</p>
<p>I would add some electrolytes in there</p>
<p>and then what happens is like uh use a</p>
<p>straw or your lips will turn blue</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s going to go in your body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s between the first and second or</p>
<p>third day you notice your urine is going</p>
<p>to be green because when you add yellow</p>
<p>to Blue you get green and that green</p>
<p>that methylene blue is a really good</p>
<p>natural well I wouldn&rsquo;t say natural</p>
<p>instead of synthetic but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good non-invasive way</p>
<p>to help bladder infections because you</p>
<p>have all this blue dye that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>antimicrobial that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>Wipe Out the bad guys in your bladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good way to do it and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of research on that as</p>
<p>well in fact methylene blue is one of</p>
<p>the first drugs that was ever prescribed</p>
<p>but you can get it over the counter and</p>
<p>I have videos on it very interesting</p>
<p>product all right terrific let&rsquo;s kick it</p>
<p>off with today&rsquo;s first question and this</p>
<p>is a great relief for the audience is a</p>
<p>true falser meaning they&rsquo;ve got a 50</p>
<p>chance of being brilliant and there it</p>
<p>is Doc</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>the free cholesterol molecule</p>
<p>in your blood</p>
<p>well let me just let me just re let me</p>
<p>just redo this question true or false</p>
<p>the free clef the free cholesterol</p>
<p>molecule does not exist in the blood</p>
<p>all right what do you think audience</p>
<p>speaking of the audience it is just huge</p>
<p>as usual so we&rsquo;d like to take a moment</p>
<p>out to say a good morning to all our</p>
<p>viewers joining us today from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Mexico Abu Dhabi Bulgaria</p>
<p>Switzerland South Africa</p>
<p>Uganda excuse me France Australia Jordan</p>
<p>Finland Singapore cashmere</p>
<p>Ghana</p>
<p>Martis sorry Terry probably didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that right maritus Meritus Greece</p>
<p>Armenia Italy Egypt Chile Germany</p>
<p>Pakistan Nigeria Israel Norway Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia Algeria Oman Austria the</p>
<p>Netherlands the Virgin Islands haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from them for a while Trinidad and</p>
<p>Tobago Japan Taiwan the Philippines the</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Poland to Czech</p>
<p>Republic Malaysia Brunel</p>
<p>Sweden India New Zealand Peru</p>
<p>Colombia and by the way for Arna Belgium</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be joining us after a</p>
<p>while and then of course everybody</p>
<p>across these United States says thanks</p>
<p>for everybody in the states and around</p>
<p>the world for your attention and you</p>
<p>know to that end it&rsquo;s a little later in</p>
<p>Belgium not uncomfortably it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>about four or five o&rsquo;clock there is my</p>
<p>guess so why don&rsquo;t we kick things off in</p>
<p>our green room with Arna if I said his</p>
<p>name right and Arna unmute yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on with your one question in</p>
<p>30 seconds for Dr Berg go</p>
<p>okay hello Dr Burke my question is</p>
<p>twofold and relates to building muscle</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told I need about 3 000</p>
<p>calories a day and two times my weight</p>
<p>in kilograms um in proteins a day what</p>
<p>are some good sources for proteins and</p>
<p>the most important how can I make sure I</p>
<p>consume enough calories a day which</p>
<p>seems a bit hard without consuming</p>
<p>carbohydrates and sugars also</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is recommended how</p>
<p>do you combine that with protein intake</p>
<p>since your body can only take in x</p>
<p>amount of proteins every few hours if I</p>
<p>were to eat only one or two meals a day</p>
<p>I cannot get the 150 to 160 grams</p>
<p>required unless of course I drink</p>
<p>multiple protein shakes or shakes or</p>
<p>other supplements thank you</p>
<p>yes well um how old are you</p>
<p>37 okay and how much do you weigh right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>um like</p>
<p>like in between 75 and 80 kilograms</p>
<p>and how tall are you</p>
<p>about 180 meters</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>how many feet would you be as I have to</p>
<p>convert that to think I think how tall</p>
<p>you are 1.8</p>
<p>I close to Six Feet</p>
<p>okay okay good so you want to gain</p>
<p>weight this is um a good question it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re young and you you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to lose weight and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem when you cut out the carbs right</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s some here&rsquo;s some tips</p>
<p>on that uh carbs stimulant insulin</p>
<p>insulin is anabolic it makes things get</p>
<p>bigger and so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>um we don&rsquo;t want to do it on keto</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>um protein</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so much you can uh</p>
<p>digest but um but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>protein does also trigger insulin</p>
<p>so it can actually help you on that</p>
<p>angle protein will um at the same time</p>
<p>stimulate another hormone called</p>
<p>glucagon so we have this kind of this</p>
<p>insulin effect but it&rsquo;s not as bad as</p>
<p>carbs because we have these other</p>
<p>hormones involved</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re trying to gain weight</p>
<p>um yeah you can go ahead and um get some</p>
<p>of this sugar indirectly by eating a</p>
<p>little bit more protein now what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do is really hard because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of protein to eat within</p>
<p>two meals</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fairly Young</p>
<p>you got to find out</p>
<p>do you have insulin resistance do you</p>
<p>have blood sugar problems there is about</p>
<p>30 of the population that does not have</p>
<p>insulin resistance they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>problems with blood sugars and they can</p>
<p>get away with</p>
<p>more of these these proteins so without</p>
<p>creating a problem so what I would do is</p>
<p>I would just kind of go as much as you</p>
<p>can and go not not by measuring grams or</p>
<p>or kilograms or anything like that but</p>
<p>just go how you feel because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start eating and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna like oh I am stuffed and then if</p>
<p>you keep stuffing yourself that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s not healthy it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be good it&rsquo;s not the way to gain</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>um this is why a lot of bodybuilders and</p>
<p>things they eat like every hour and they</p>
<p>just they just like kind of do that but</p>
<p>then you get this insulin Spike and they</p>
<p>end up having a lot of problems when</p>
<p>they get older with this issue so I</p>
<p>would um</p>
<p>beef up no pun intended your workouts</p>
<p>more than anything else and what I would</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>because I would do two meals and I would</p>
<p>space them out fairly like maybe one in</p>
<p>the morning and one at dinner so that</p>
<p>way you have this nice time to let your</p>
<p>digestive system rather than have them</p>
<p>too close together so you have somewhat</p>
<p>of an appetite and then what I would do</p>
<p>is I would I would hit your carbs at 50</p>
<p>grams</p>
<p>um and I would also um go for quality</p>
<p>protein I wouldn&rsquo;t do protein powders I</p>
<p>would do real protein and the best is</p>
<p>going to be eggs eggs eggs grass-fed</p>
<p>meat and fish and seafood</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do and then I would</p>
<p>uh you know hit the hit the weights hard</p>
<p>and I would um get yourself a lot of</p>
<p>rest in between but uh and there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>things that you can do to tweak things</p>
<p>like creatinine other products but um go</p>
<p>with your ability to digest that food</p>
<p>and then don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t worry about trying</p>
<p>to reach a certain amount because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many variables it&rsquo;s too hard</p>
<p>to figure that out and and those numbers</p>
<p>too are very arbitrary based on</p>
<p>you know opinions and things like that</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome all right thanks very</p>
<p>much so we want you to come back in a</p>
<p>couple of weeks just enormous looking</p>
<p>like Arnold so we&rsquo;ll see hopefully all</p>
<p>that works great okay thanks for uh</p>
<p>getting in touch with us Arna and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s go back to social media if we</p>
<p>will uh no answers from the no there is</p>
<p>an answer already from quiz question</p>
<p>number one so let&rsquo;s take that and that</p>
<p>question asked true false the free</p>
<p>cholesterol molecule does not exist in</p>
<p>the blood or however you said it Dr Berg</p>
<p>but they seem to have gotten the point</p>
<p>because 60 percent of the respondents</p>
<p>say it is or that jumped it is false and</p>
<p>forty percent say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s the answer free class the</p>
<p>free cholesterol molecule does not exist</p>
<p>in your blood you know when you get a a</p>
<p>cholesterol test right it says total</p>
<p>cholesterol in your mind you might think</p>
<p>you have cholesterol floating through</p>
<p>your blood that is absolutely not true</p>
<p>you have no free cholesterol in your</p>
<p>blood</p>
<p>it it can&rsquo;t it can&rsquo;t move it has to be</p>
<p>attached to a protein to move and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s why then you look at the um</p>
<p>the protein lipoproteins which are fat</p>
<p>protein molecules which are like the LDL</p>
<p>the HDL things like that so that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>cholesterol exists not as free</p>
<p>cholesterol which is interesting so</p>
<p>um when you look at the total</p>
<p>cholesterol you could pretty much ignore</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t even look at it just go into</p>
<p>how these is cholesterol packaged and</p>
<p>what then you can understand what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening based on that data but you</p>
<p>probably need a lot more data but the</p>
<p>point is that I come</p>
<p>these fats need a shuttle and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>we have the lipoproteins</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>YouTube where</p>
<p>melsy excuse me is asking is iodine good</p>
<p>for Hashimoto&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m getting conflicting</p>
<p>information and it&rsquo;s so confusing</p>
<p>well you don&rsquo;t want to start taking more</p>
<p>than you need it&rsquo;s not that you want to</p>
<p>deprive yourself you want to have an</p>
<p>adequate amount but it&rsquo;s not really the</p>
<p>remedy that you need for Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because Hashimoto&rsquo;s is an autoimmune</p>
<p>disease it&rsquo;s not a deficiency of iodine</p>
<p>even though the idea needs I I&rsquo;m even</p>
<p>though the thyroid needs iodine</p>
<p>um Hashimoto&rsquo;s is autoimmune it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just a regular hypothyroid deficiency of</p>
<p>iodine so um it&rsquo;s usually stemming from</p>
<p>the gut</p>
<p>um and you have to avoid gluten for sure</p>
<p>um but um the best mineral Trace mineral</p>
<p>to take for Hashimoto&rsquo;s is selenium okay</p>
<p>but but don&rsquo;t be afraid of taking some</p>
<p>iodine too so usually when you take a</p>
<p>trace mineral like a you know seleniums</p>
<p>product there&rsquo;s also iodine in there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about that but just but</p>
<p>iodine is not the primary thing that you</p>
<p>need it&rsquo;s selenium</p>
<p>all right very good and here&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>probing you with a personal question</p>
<p>Nori from Facebook wants to know Dr Berg</p>
<p>what do you use as a sugar substitute</p>
<p>um I use I like using</p>
<p>erythritol and monk fruit and then</p>
<p>Stevia I like that a lot and um</p>
<p>Xylitol tastes is good for people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like they have to have sugar so</p>
<p>they have to something have something</p>
<p>that tastes just like sugar</p>
<p>um so xylitol is good the problem is</p>
<p>with Xylitol for some people it does</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not zero on the glycemic index like</p>
<p>erythritol it&rsquo;s like 30. but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having small amounts it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>so xylitol&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good one that tastes just like</p>
<p>sugar especially if you want to put</p>
<p>something in your coffee you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to put Stevia but the worst sugar</p>
<p>alcohol would be Mannitol because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t even I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>believe that&rsquo;s a sugar alcohol because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it really will spike your blood</p>
<p>sugars big time huh well that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>but our questions are great and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next one doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>within which organ within which body</p>
<p>organ</p>
<p>does zinc occur at the highest levels</p>
<p>All Right audience climbing on that</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about the storages ink</p>
<p>what organ has the most concentrated</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>all right well there&rsquo;s other people</p>
<p>around the world that are anxious to</p>
<p>become part of the show and the list and</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;d like to also say a shout out to</p>
<p>our other viewers joining us from South</p>
<p>Korea Aruba Dubai turkey Barbados Malta</p>
<p>and Bermuda and of course Belgium in a</p>
<p>salute to Arna and so welcome folks</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay Christy from</p>
<p>Facebook do you still recommend</p>
<p>photamine for a B1 deficiency</p>
<p>very good question I recommend</p>
<p>benphotamine for very specific B vitamin</p>
<p>deficiencies the ones that you have on</p>
<p>your feet in your hands like um as a</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy from diabetes or</p>
<p>other reasons</p>
<p>um when we get into a b deficiency in</p>
<p>your brain then photamine apparently</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work as good</p>
<p>so you need another type of B1 uh aloe I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called aloe thionine is a</p>
<p>good one it&rsquo;s from garlic and I have</p>
<p>some data on that on my website you can</p>
<p>check it out it&rsquo;s a natural form of B1</p>
<p>but it also is lipotropic it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fat</p>
<p>soluble so it does penetrate the brain</p>
<p>much better than</p>
<p>um infotamine does but benphotamine is a</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamin but it&rsquo;s better for</p>
<p>the peripheral nerves</p>
<p>okay very good speaking of muscles which</p>
<p>is included in some of our questions</p>
<p>today and from YouTube I need to build</p>
<p>muscle mass I&rsquo;m 72 years old and 109</p>
<p>pounds and I&rsquo;m recovery from intestinal</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>well then stay tuned because that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of our questions and uh</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re going to be answering this one</p>
<p>question what is the only</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>thing that can directly</p>
<p>make Muscle okay that can make your</p>
<p>muscles get bigger there&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>so stay tuned for that all right Ann</p>
<p>stand by looks like we&rsquo;re gonna have an</p>
<p>answer for you</p>
<p>okay uh Craig from Facebook what do I do</p>
<p>to treat and it&rsquo;s an acronym Nash</p>
<p>n-a-s-h</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re talking about a fatty liver</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um you need to cut the carbs out of your</p>
<p>diet and you need to have</p>
<p>um very healthy ingredients like big</p>
<p>salads cruciferous vegetables a great</p>
<p>product would be milk thistle it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>has a lot of research behind a fatty</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>and then also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>garlic is good bitter vegetables like</p>
<p>arugula and dandelion greens and some of</p>
<p>these other ones</p>
<p>um but you have to cut down the carbs of</p>
<p>course and</p>
<p>uh no alcohol if you want to restore</p>
<p>that liver all right very good good luck</p>
<p>with that Nathan from YouTube what are</p>
<p>your thoughts about taking tryptophan</p>
<p>for helping sleep</p>
<p>I like it I think it&rsquo;s a natural thing</p>
<p>you must take it on an empty stomach</p>
<p>because it competes with other proteins</p>
<p>to make it work</p>
<p>um but tryptophan is one of the</p>
<p>ingredients in my sleep formula because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s um it actually can</p>
<p>convert into serotonin and melatonin and</p>
<p>and help you drift off into a wonderful</p>
<p>night&rsquo;s sleep and uh it&rsquo;s virtually no</p>
<p>side effects wow that&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s tryptophan where we went</p>
<p>there hang on just a second oh why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we get back to the uh uh quickly</p>
<p>responding audience they&rsquo;ve got an</p>
<p>answer for uh what body part organ does</p>
<p>zinc occur in the highest levels so</p>
<p>audience drum roll please uh 70 of our</p>
<p>respondents say it is the liver 10 save</p>
<p>is the pancreas 10 say it&rsquo;s the brain</p>
<p>and ten percent say it&rsquo;s the genitals</p>
<p>Terry</p>
<p>State oh wow prostate prostate is the</p>
<p>answer so with that qualifies genitals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of the genitals it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a storage and a pump and it</p>
<p>produces um part of the semen so it is</p>
<p>part of the whole apparatus there and um</p>
<p>zinc is</p>
<p>um really important in fertility and</p>
<p>involved in hundreds of different</p>
<p>enzomatic biochemical reactions</p>
<p>and so we need that zinc uh for</p>
<p>fertility reasons so our bodies will</p>
<p>allocate a good amount the most amount</p>
<p>in your prostate interesting all right</p>
<p>well ten percent uh give yourself a</p>
<p>round of applause uh now let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>as a side benefit an extra tip at no</p>
<p>charge</p>
<p>um men that have enlarged prostates</p>
<p>usually always are low in zinc wow</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big correlation between low</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>and prostate enlargement as well as low</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>well I know a guy with an enlarged</p>
<p>prostate so I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell him</p>
<p>about that maybe I&rsquo;ll even run out and</p>
<p>grab some zinc for him</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>I like that it&rsquo;s like um people says I</p>
<p>know this person they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>talking about themselves well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right I gave it up let&rsquo;s see uh how</p>
<p>about Sylvia from Facebook is it okay to</p>
<p>take bile salts if your gallbladder has</p>
<p>been removed</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more important to take bile</p>
<p>salts because you&rsquo;re not able to</p>
<p>concentrate those bile salts enough so</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re having a weaker amount of bile</p>
<p>salts that are released on a uh not like</p>
<p>like we do in sufficient amounts when we</p>
<p>eat we don&rsquo;t have that storage that we</p>
<p>can just push that thing out so</p>
<p>um I would just really</p>
<p>um watch</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>deficiency symptoms of the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins for example vitamin A let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving down the street and you</p>
<p>notice at night you boy your my vision</p>
<p>is getting worse and worse</p>
<p>um to see in the dark then chances are</p>
<p>you need biosols to get more vitamin A</p>
<p>absorption</p>
<p>um but um the other thing too is if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in bile your stool will</p>
<p>start floating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a little bit light colored</p>
<p>and then also your um</p>
<p>if you get too much bile</p>
<p>um that means you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>diarrhea so just use those two things to</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>adjudicate how much bile salt you really</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>all right well here we go with the</p>
<p>prostate again Zappa FK he calls himself</p>
<p>from YouTube last night I was diagnosed</p>
<p>with prostate cancer what should my next</p>
<p>steps be</p>
<p>I think you should um go to the website</p>
<p>uh his name is Guy tandembom and um we</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>co-sponsored a research study in cancer</p>
<p>in Europe with good success he had stage</p>
<p>four prostate cancer and he has can he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cancer-free right now and you should</p>
<p>study what he did I interviewed him and</p>
<p>watched my videos on cancer there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protocol that you can follow it&rsquo;s on his</p>
<p>website</p>
<p>um nutritional and the most important</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m going to emphasize this again</p>
<p>and again for cancer is to go on that</p>
<p>long fast immediately if especially if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stage four like I would go 21 days</p>
<p>no question jump on that fast and just</p>
<p>stop eating of course take do the right</p>
<p>things with supplements and stuff but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s kind of like um</p>
<p>I always mention this book Sun Tzu the</p>
<p>technology of War let&rsquo;s see if I have</p>
<p>this book it&rsquo;s one of my favorite books</p>
<p>you should if you don&rsquo;t have this you</p>
<p>should get it it&rsquo;s basically the</p>
<p>original transcription of um Sun Tzu</p>
<p>this guy actually translated exactly how</p>
<p>the original text without adding</p>
<p>anything to it it&rsquo;s very different but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of principles in here I</p>
<p>applied to health and you can apply it</p>
<p>to life and one principle is</p>
<p>you want to win the war without going</p>
<p>the battle you don&rsquo;t want to battle</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s very powerful and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s very scary and so how do</p>
<p>you win the war</p>
<p>um without battling and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about like attacking it directly with</p>
<p>every weapon you can because you end up</p>
<p>using chemotherapy and I&rsquo;m not telling</p>
<p>you not to take that but you end up</p>
<p>killing off the cancer but you kill off</p>
<p>the immune system too so you have to be</p>
<p>smart and there&rsquo;s a lot of strategies</p>
<p>you have to use and one is uh to go on a</p>
<p>fast a long fast that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>strategy to avoid the battling</p>
<p>that comes with collateral damage</p>
<p>um so I applaud this to the immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>life and everything&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s that you</p>
<p>can get it on online Kindle I think uh</p>
<p>on Amazon but that&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>um and there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a way that you</p>
<p>can get out of this and uh unfortunately</p>
<p>you know more more people should work on</p>
<p>the strategy of prevention</p>
<p>than to wait until they have it</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s why I put out these videos</p>
<p>so you can get that knowledge so you can</p>
<p>then avoid problems rather than end up</p>
<p>with them all right well best of luck</p>
<p>with that our thoughts and prayers I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure around the world are with you on</p>
<p>that Zappa so funny how these people</p>
<p>come up with these names Midwest can is</p>
<p>the name apparently this person&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>with so mid Midwest can uh ask probably</p>
<p>his real name Steve yeah I&rsquo;m sure it is</p>
<p>what were his parents thinking what are</p>
<p>your thoughts on iaf for someone with</p>
<p>hormonal issues we now have a six month</p>
<p>old and my wife was on in vitro</p>
<p>fertilization shots she has heard</p>
<p>negative things about uh intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and hormones what do you think</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>is it natural to do intermittent fasting</p>
<p>have our bodies evolve within a minute</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>way back in the day Steve when food was</p>
<p>not available</p>
<p>did we could we go to the grocery store</p>
<p>and get food and the answer is the big</p>
<p>fat no you can&rsquo;t um so our bodies are do</p>
<p>very well when we do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting simply because uh that&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>body is designed so uh hormonally it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about getting nutrition and</p>
<p>nutrients can you get your nutrients</p>
<p>by by doing intermittent fasting yes you</p>
<p>focus on Quality Foods</p>
<p>can you get your nutrients by eating a</p>
<p>lot of calories no not necessarily</p>
<p>especially nowadays so it&rsquo;s really just</p>
<p>about eating Quality Foods and not</p>
<p>snacking so much and I think even your</p>
<p>fertility will improve because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to restore insulin resistance</p>
<p>which is behind a lot of problems with</p>
<p>fertility</p>
<p>or infertility</p>
<p>wow so</p>
<p>um yeah so that&rsquo;s why like even a</p>
<p>diabetic for example who has insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not as nearly as</p>
<p>fertile as someone who&rsquo;s a non-diabetic</p>
<p>all right very good well here&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>probing questions for you Dr Burke well</p>
<p>we want to know I mean you and Karen are</p>
<p>so healthy how do you do it so Bernie</p>
<p>from YouTube are you eating breakfast</p>
<p>these days how often do you change up</p>
<p>your eating window</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t need to do the breakfast</p>
<p>I did a video Once where I said you know</p>
<p>you should try to switch it up and have</p>
<p>the breakfast and the lunch uh I and I</p>
<p>said I was going to try that out and I</p>
<p>did and um I didn&rsquo;t like it as much</p>
<p>because I was eating when I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>so what I do now is I I have like a</p>
<p>lunch and then</p>
<p>um ideally uh several hours later I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have another meal</p>
<p>um I like to keep the dinner early as</p>
<p>possible I mean 3 30 would be great but</p>
<p>sometimes I go to like four or even five</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t do that okay</p>
<p>just do two meals and whenever you can</p>
<p>squeeze them in but um the majority of</p>
<p>people that are doing this are doing two</p>
<p>meals no snacks and I think that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>but as you get older</p>
<p>and you want more health benefits and</p>
<p>you need to lose more weight you go to</p>
<p>the omad the one meal a day</p>
<p>that would be the best thing to do all</p>
<p>right very good let&rsquo;s go uh</p>
<p>to Yvonne who is in Columbia South</p>
<p>Carolina although I think now she&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania or something she really</p>
<p>gets around Yvonne unmute yourself and</p>
<p>go ahead with your one question for Dr</p>
<p>Bird please</p>
<p>okay Dr Burke thank you thank you thank</p>
<p>you for your generosity with all your</p>
<p>knowledge it really helped me a lot</p>
<p>um my question I&rsquo;m doing keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting oh mad I&rsquo;m right</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m at 20 hours I&rsquo;m real proud of</p>
<p>myself</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been doing the kale Shake</p>
<p>because I have an enlarged liver I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been gallbladder issues it only works</p>
<p>about 25 they say</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true but um so I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>all this I&rsquo;ve been doing everything I</p>
<p>take all your stuff</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>my hair is falling I&rsquo;ve lost two-thirds</p>
<p>of my hair</p>
<p>and it was coming it was falling before</p>
<p>I started the keto</p>
<p>um but since then it&rsquo;s really been</p>
<p>falling out not at the roots just</p>
<p>breaking</p>
<p>so I I&rsquo;m on um</p>
<p>um trying to come off my thyroid</p>
<p>medicine I had half my thyroid removed</p>
<p>they um left enough they said so I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t need medicine but they put me</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>50 micrograms of Synthroid anyway</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to come off that because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like medicine so I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>take the uh</p>
<p>I tropin PMG and I&rsquo;m trying to slowly</p>
<p>come off my thyroid medicine but my hair</p>
<p>is just falling falling falling so I</p>
<p>looked up the Armor Thyroid I want to</p>
<p>know what the difference is between that</p>
<p>one and the one I&rsquo;m taking is the other</p>
<p>one better than this one you know I I</p>
<p>saw your video on the different</p>
<p>hormones that your thyroid really does</p>
<p>make so</p>
<p>I like to get them all I&rsquo;m just not sure</p>
<p>um did you say you&rsquo;re taking did you say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking Synthroid I can&rsquo;t uh I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to come off of it I&rsquo;m like uh at</p>
<p>a quarter of my pills so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing okay except my legs get a</p>
<p>little tired a little weak and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>slowly coming off of it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um well um you know I was in Columbia uh</p>
<p>South Carolina when I went to basic</p>
<p>training uh for Fort Jackson yeah I</p>
<p>think in the summer and I tell you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the hottest place that I&rsquo;ve ever been in</p>
<p>my life never sweat I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>my hands I was like this is an oven</p>
<p>hot hot hot town yeah and and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a chance to uh you just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fully uh manned up and you&rsquo;re carrying a</p>
<p>rucksack and you&rsquo;re yeah 17 miles so</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>um so this is what you a couple things</p>
<p>with your thyroid</p>
<p>um I think um a really important thing</p>
<p>to take a bit more of is those trace</p>
<p>minerals including zinc uh for the hair</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing you that thyroid is</p>
<p>probably indirectly kicking your butt</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have the full full</p>
<p>function when you get the um</p>
<p>natural thyroid or the Armor Thyroid you</p>
<p>get uh calcitonin which is a which is a</p>
<p>different hormone that can help regulate</p>
<p>calcium because I get the feeling that</p>
<p>calcium can even be one reason why the</p>
<p>hair falls out too</p>
<p>um because it helps to trans and</p>
<p>regulate that with the parathyroid I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know if when they took out</p>
<p>part of your thyroid if they took out</p>
<p>the parathyroid too that would they did</p>
<p>they did it did okay so now that tells</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you want to probably get a blood test of</p>
<p>your phosphorus and your calcium and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to play around with</p>
<p>those two numbers but I think the</p>
<p>solution would be also to add one more</p>
<p>product from standard process called</p>
<p>Kalma plus that is the one comma plus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that supports the</p>
<p>parathyroid okay okay</p>
<p>when I looked up armored thyroid and I</p>
<p>was looking at the ingredients you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that on under the ingredients so</p>
<p>calciton they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t list they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about this um they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>list it&rsquo;s just like a glandular right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole glandular they don&rsquo;t list</p>
<p>all the different things in there but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it gives you all the normal</p>
<p>hormones that your thyroid produces</p>
<p>versus the Synthroid is only only one T4</p>
<p>which then you have to convert it so um</p>
<p>to convert the that&rsquo;s Synthroid boy you</p>
<p>need that selenium you need zinc</p>
<p>um and let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>year but you don&rsquo;t have enough your body</p>
<p>is going to go after fixing maybe one</p>
<p>thing but not the other and as far as</p>
<p>the survival</p>
<p>um priorities in the body the hair is</p>
<p>not at the top of the list so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably why it&rsquo;s not going there so you</p>
<p>just have to take more trade more trace</p>
<p>minerals probably</p>
<p>um some Biotin and uh make sure those B</p>
<p>vitamins are good but I get the feeling</p>
<p>that the parathyroid could be one thing</p>
<p>that is missing in this because they</p>
<p>they remove that unfortunately or they</p>
<p>have I don&rsquo;t know how many They removed</p>
<p>all of them or just three but I I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know yeah no okay so the armor thyroid</p>
<p>is better than what I&rsquo;m taking the thigh</p>
<p>the the standard process I think it is</p>
<p>from my viewpoint just because it has</p>
<p>the whole complex it has all the</p>
<p>hormones I mean I would ask the doc um</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t have the full function of my</p>
<p>thyroid where am I getting calcitonin if</p>
<p>I if I don&rsquo;t have the parasite right</p>
<p>where am I going to getting parathormone</p>
<p>you know like these are questions I</p>
<p>would ask um</p>
<p>I will ask because I do have an</p>
<p>appointment coming up yes yes</p>
<p>yeah so okay well that that should I</p>
<p>hope that helps because I&rsquo;m losing</p>
<p>volumes and volumes of hair and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;m not happy with</p>
<p>but everything else Works everything you</p>
<p>said is just right on the money and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking tatka all the time and got rid of</p>
<p>the side pain I had in my gallbladder</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>yeah and they just said a lot of doing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also taking milk thistle right</p>
<p>because you probably watch that video</p>
<p>good you&rsquo;re taking all the most powerful</p>
<p>things for your liver and um and by the</p>
<p>way you know the thyroid works with the</p>
<p>liver so I think the more the liver gets</p>
<p>improved the thyroid will do better and</p>
<p>the thyroid hormones will do better so</p>
<p>um yeah I think you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track just have to tweak it a little bit</p>
<p>all right well thank you thank you thank</p>
<p>you again for everything you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome and stay warm stay warm</p>
<p>I bet she will oh goodness basic</p>
<p>training I&rsquo;d last about 30 seconds now</p>
<p>if that okay let&rsquo;s go see once you get</p>
<p>once you sign up and you get in you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get out oh</p>
<p>um until until the end because if you</p>
<p>try to get out sooner then you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to basically stay there longer so um you</p>
<p>got to just toughen it up oh my God</p>
<p>where is my discipline okay Mary from</p>
<p>Facebook I am doing omad and regular</p>
<p>48-hour fast good for you in between how</p>
<p>can I tell when I&rsquo;m no longer insulin</p>
<p>resistant</p>
<p>um the biggest uh indicator to know that</p>
<p>insulin resistance is no longer a</p>
<p>problem is when you can go a long period</p>
<p>of time without the hunger so your</p>
<p>appetite goes away because now you have</p>
<p>an efficient machine now</p>
<p>people say well is it cured</p>
<p>because when I go back to carbs it comes</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>you have to look at it a little bit</p>
<p>differently because</p>
<p>um there you can</p>
<p>take the insulin make insulin more</p>
<p>sensitive but as soon as you go back to</p>
<p>the carbs your body is going to become</p>
<p>more insulin resistant so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like um it&rsquo;s not something that you can</p>
<p>go back to your normal foods and still</p>
<p>be okay it&rsquo;s like your body&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>you you need to stick with this for the</p>
<p>rest of your life but the point is that</p>
<p>if we can just keep your symptoms</p>
<p>at Bay the symptom indicator would be no</p>
<p>more hunger and you can within reason</p>
<p>and you can go long periods of time with</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re fasting very good okay what</p>
<p>great questions are we having we&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>to that darn prostate there you go doc</p>
<p>question number three</p>
<p>all right which exists in higher amounts</p>
<p>in an enlarged prostate testosterone or</p>
<p>estrogen</p>
<p>which one of those uh</p>
<p>is responsible for more of an enlarged</p>
<p>prostate and I&rsquo;m telling you our</p>
<p>audience is so smart they&rsquo;re definitely</p>
<p>folks out there that know so we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait for your answers let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s Margaret from Facebook</p>
<p>uh can you we take fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>without food I&rsquo;m confused because I fast</p>
<p>a lot</p>
<p>yeah you can you know like when</p>
<p>something is fat soluble they they want</p>
<p>you to eat some fat with it to make it</p>
<p>uh dissolve and be absorbed</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s why you eat it with a meal But</p>
<p>realize this um you&rsquo;re still going to</p>
<p>get a an adequate amount of absorption</p>
<p>even if you have it without food so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s not the most uh</p>
<p>um important thing to do so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting go ahead and just take them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get benefit and this is</p>
<p>also why in in a lot of my fat soluble</p>
<p>products like the vitamin D product that</p>
<p>I have I also added in their fat so you</p>
<p>could actually eat or consume it on an</p>
<p>empty stomach fine because you have some</p>
<p>oil in there MCT oil to help you absorb</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>all right um here&rsquo;s one of those people</p>
<p>bragging about you again Jessica from</p>
<p>YouTube I have lost 40 pounds</p>
<p>you have a little ding there and on</p>
<p>healthy keto and reverse my diabetes and</p>
<p>lowered my A1C numbers thank you Dr Berg</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that great</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and then of course um</p>
<p>it was probably just a coincidence so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great that you cured your disease</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right how wonderful okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um Anna from Facebook what are the best</p>
<p>supplements to prevent a recurrence of</p>
<p>papillary thyroid cancer my thyroid has</p>
<p>been removed is she still in danger with</p>
<p>no thyroid</p>
<p>well um</p>
<p>um I think um to prevent cancer from</p>
<p>coming back is to really focus in on</p>
<p>what cancer is and understand it a bit</p>
<p>more and that&rsquo;s why I have all these</p>
<p>videos on it cancer is a normal cell</p>
<p>that changes over into</p>
<p>a cancer cell so all cancer comes from</p>
<p>normal cells</p>
<p>why because they&rsquo;re damaged the</p>
<p>mitochondria is damaged so if you can</p>
<p>just know all the things that damage</p>
<p>mitochondria and avoid those things then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best way to prevent cancer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d list that in my videos you know</p>
<p>too much refined sugar too much stress</p>
<p>chronic inflammation</p>
<p>um and all the other things that people</p>
<p>already know the smoking the drinking uh</p>
<p>you know junk Foods things like that so</p>
<p>um and then also if you do periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fasting that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>really really important if you had</p>
<p>cancer going forward you better continue</p>
<p>to do like maybe every two weeks you do</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>48 hour fast maybe every year you do a</p>
<p>seven day fast</p>
<p>depending on how severe it is and then</p>
<p>keep monitoring it and then do whatever</p>
<p>you can to keep the stress low because</p>
<p>stress can also trigger this cancer</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>Green Room speaking of bloating Andrew</p>
<p>is coming to us from St Louis and Andrew</p>
<p>you are on with Dr Berg one question 30</p>
<p>seconds ago</p>
<p>okay uh thank you Dr Berg for your show</p>
<p>and your your mini videos they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>very helpful and uh you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>enjoyed watching them and getting what I</p>
<p>can out of them</p>
<p>um the question I have is</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been doing your Keto Plan and</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve lost weight and my wife has</p>
<p>been doing it as well she hasn&rsquo;t had the</p>
<p>same success and she has been</p>
<p>um like a belly bloat that she has I</p>
<p>know you mentioned</p>
<p>um talking about uh the the colon and</p>
<p>things like that but</p>
<p>um she&rsquo;s been doing a lot for the colon</p>
<p>and trying to</p>
<p>um you know taking a Prebiotic a</p>
<p>probiotic we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and she went on a</p>
<p>complete fast for over 48 Hours she</p>
<p>takes your various</p>
<p>supplements and just can&rsquo;t seem to get</p>
<p>rid of that belly bloat and I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking that maybe it might be an</p>
<p>adrenal problem but I&rsquo;m not really sure</p>
<p>you know you brought up a good point</p>
<p>um one thing I didn&rsquo;t mention is um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s experiences stress</p>
<p>but like if she wakes up with her</p>
<p>stomach flat and then towards the end of</p>
<p>the day it&rsquo;s bloated suspect stress and</p>
<p>that can um so she&rsquo;s gonna have to maybe</p>
<p>uh do long walks identify the source of</p>
<p>the stress and do whatever you can to</p>
<p>resolve it take adaptogens like</p>
<p>ashwagandha is a good one there&rsquo;s Rishi</p>
<p>mushroom cordycep there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>different natural things out there as</p>
<p>adaptogens that she can take</p>
<p>um the other thing too is she doing two</p>
<p>meals or one day one meal a day</p>
<p>um she she normally does two but</p>
<p>sometimes like she&rsquo;ll do like a week</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;ll just do one meal and then</p>
<p>sometimes at most she&rsquo;s only doing two</p>
<p>meals</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll create a video</p>
<p>um just more in depth uh on this topic</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an important one and I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s easy to solve if you just</p>
<p>identify</p>
<p>especially</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in her case</p>
<p>you know you do the prebiotics you do</p>
<p>the probiotics if it makes it worse boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest clue that you might</p>
<p>she might have sibo small intestinal</p>
<p>bacterial overgrowth in which case we</p>
<p>need to give her betaine out of chloride</p>
<p>for the stomach get rid of that and help</p>
<p>her digestion and do one meal a day only</p>
<p>these are important things but um</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s one guy who came into my</p>
<p>practice long ago and uh he had</p>
<p>his stress related bloating and um</p>
<p>he went down I think he went to Florida</p>
<p>or something and he laid in the beach</p>
<p>and just got</p>
<p>primitive stress and his he came back</p>
<p>with a completely flat stomach and so</p>
<p>this was a cortisol response and so the</p>
<p>cortisol can actually cause more of</p>
<p>inflammatory things so</p>
<p>um you know it&rsquo;s just a matter of now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watch those videos that I have on stress</p>
<p>and work on that but I would</p>
<p>really watch also try to identify the</p>
<p>fibers and the carbs and the sugars that</p>
<p>even like the keto friendly uh</p>
<p>acceptable fibers that they</p>
<p>especially in certain products I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if she has that as well but but</p>
<p>just stay tuned for uh more detailed</p>
<p>video on that so we can completely solve</p>
<p>that because I think she&rsquo;s close but she</p>
<p>just needs the whole all the details</p>
<p>right thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>great thanks so much so Andrew you</p>
<p>wrapped it up for us in the green room</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve all done so terrifically and</p>
<p>helped entertain the world for goodness</p>
<p>sakes so we sure hope that your wife</p>
<p>gets some relief from that bloating I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure that&rsquo;s no uh fun</p>
<p>and uh sometimes I can&rsquo;t see my belt but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bloating I think it</p>
<p>might be something else but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on that okay so we have a median</p>
<p>answer back from the uh quiz question</p>
<p>number three which asks which is in</p>
<p>higher amounts and in large prostate</p>
<p>testosterone or estrogen and I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you I hope they&rsquo;re right because a</p>
<p>hundred percent of them said it is</p>
<p>estrogen</p>
<p>they are correct okay</p>
<p>um because when we you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see many young men with</p>
<p>enlarged prostate it&rsquo;s as we get older</p>
<p>and associated with that is a lower</p>
<p>testosterone so estrogen is an</p>
<p>interesting Factor because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all the estrogen in our bodies men and</p>
<p>women both</p>
<p>um originate estrogen from testosterone</p>
<p>to testosterone is the</p>
<p>thing that you can turn estrogen or</p>
<p>estrogen turns into</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s an enzyme called</p>
<p>aromatase that does it and you got to</p>
<p>know how to inhibit</p>
<p>that enzyme so we could have less</p>
<p>estrogen in men and um and also</p>
<p>understand what elevates it as well and</p>
<p>avoid that and Insulin the carbs are one</p>
<p>thing you need to avoid because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>automatically increase it but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also um</p>
<p>in the lemon peel not the lemon juice</p>
<p>and the lemon peel there is uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called aromatase inhibitor so you could</p>
<p>actually blend a whole lemon and I did a</p>
<p>video on this with your electrolytes and</p>
<p>some water and drink that</p>
<p>during the day or maybe once in the</p>
<p>morning and uh put some couple drops of</p>
<p>stevia in there if you want just a whole</p>
<p>lemon once a day would be very</p>
<p>beneficial to help inhibit the enzyme</p>
<p>and reduce the amount of estrogen and</p>
<p>shrink it and yes you can also do other</p>
<p>things like um you know a salt Palmetto</p>
<p>and definitely cruciferous but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the uh</p>
<p>the outer part of that lemon that peel</p>
<p>has some really good hardcore data uh</p>
<p>behind it so definitely check that out</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s interesting my niece who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now 30 something as a little girl she no</p>
<p>one told her yay or nay she&rsquo;d pick up</p>
<p>lemons and just eat them Ryan and all</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t bother and now her</p>
<p>daughter ten-year-old daughter just the</p>
<p>same thing there must be some something</p>
<p>in there allows them to channel that</p>
<p>Agony uh somewhere else and and do it so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty pretty wild okay why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we continue it&rsquo;s also good it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s good for your liver too great</p>
<p>all right well I&rsquo;ll buzz one up and put</p>
<p>20 Stevie in it and see if I can bear it</p>
<p>okay so uh here&rsquo;s the uh next to last</p>
<p>question number four doc</p>
<p>okay so what is the only trigger for</p>
<p>muscle growth and there&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>interesting okay well there&rsquo;s a hundred</p>
<p>percent opinion before let&rsquo;s see what</p>
<p>they do with this one okay our firmo G</p>
<p>for emoji I guess correct grief from</p>
<p>Facebook could seven or more Brazil nuts</p>
<p>daily cause hair loss due to selenium</p>
<p>toxicity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>um it really depends on what else you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating but um</p>
<p>the rdas for selenium really is kind of</p>
<p>like equivalent to one one Brazilian nut</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not sure about seven it really</p>
<p>depends too if you&rsquo;re also taking all</p>
<p>the other trace minerals to help balance</p>
<p>it out but just think this like if if a</p>
<p>little bit is good a lot is not always</p>
<p>better when we&rsquo;re talking about trace</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>um for example you can do too much zinc</p>
<p>and create a copper deficiency which can</p>
<p>cause the same exact hair loss as a zinc</p>
<p>deficiency so um you want just adequate</p>
<p>amounts and I and and the problem really</p>
<p>people what people are running into is</p>
<p>that um when they figured out these rdas</p>
<p>they took an average of the population</p>
<p>to figure this out so Steve let me ask</p>
<p>you a question</p>
<p>um would you say the average person is</p>
<p>healthy or not that healthy I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>have to go with not that healthy these</p>
<p>days maybe some time ago</p>
<p>excluding you and Karen but otherwise I</p>
<p>think you could probably find a hitch in</p>
<p>our get along here and there so</p>
<p>like if we take a</p>
<p>you know we take an average of all the</p>
<p>sick people and then that&rsquo;s our our bar</p>
<p>that we have to follow</p>
<p>like you take a bunch of people are</p>
<p>deficient in nutrients and like okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re a cheat we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to strive for so that is the</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um and then also</p>
<p>um even like biomarkers on the labs and</p>
<p>stuff like that how do they figure out</p>
<p>these biomarkers on labs</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um same thing with populations so</p>
<p>sometimes uh</p>
<p>a good</p>
<p>uh evaluator when they look at blood</p>
<p>tests and stuff and urine tests you have</p>
<p>to think through these averages and just</p>
<p>understand</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a a new</p>
<p>kind of a evaluation I think is going to</p>
<p>be very popular and I hope it goes</p>
<p>mainstream within the medical community</p>
<p>especially and even functional medicine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called metabolomics and you can</p>
<p>look at all the</p>
<p>um biomarkers</p>
<p>for problems with your biochemistry and</p>
<p>you could very dynamically figure things</p>
<p>out when you get this test and uh</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s training that they can really</p>
<p>figure out things and I will do a video</p>
<p>on that because I think</p>
<p>that takes it one step further than the</p>
<p>DNA test because DNA just doesn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>you what&rsquo;s happening right now in</p>
<p>present time boom</p>
<p>um it kind of says well this is what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re born with but you know this is uh</p>
<p>tells you exactly how your body is</p>
<p>existing with its environment and the</p>
<p>food and your dnas all together</p>
<p>all right very good</p>
<p>um doc U and I have a common friend Dr</p>
<p>Mark Richards and his house was almost</p>
<p>completely torn down to the ground</p>
<p>because he had so much mold in it he had</p>
<p>suffered hearing loss and all sorts of</p>
<p>other ailments so it was awful for him</p>
<p>and we have another person Tamara from</p>
<p>Facebook I&rsquo;ve been exposed exposed</p>
<p>excuse me to black mold and need to</p>
<p>detox immediately what should I be doing</p>
<p>besides tearing her house down like poor</p>
<p>Dr Richards</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>when you talk about cleanses you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the detoxification</p>
<p>mechanism in the liver and other organs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called phase one phase two</p>
<p>detoxification and there&rsquo;s enzymes</p>
<p>involved and it turns toxins into</p>
<p>harmless particles so you want to</p>
<p>support that system to get rid of mold</p>
<p>out of the body and um</p>
<p>milk thistle is a great great remedy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s uh it helps to protect the</p>
<p>liver against these poisons cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables will also stimulate this</p>
<p>phase one phase two detoxification</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the sulforaphane in</p>
<p>broccoli microgreens and radish</p>
<p>microgreens and Sprouts are very very</p>
<p>good for this as well so um you should</p>
<p>do a liver you should probably follow my</p>
<p>liver diet</p>
<p>um in my my book where I talked about</p>
<p>you know watch even my videos on it as</p>
<p>well you can just support the liver by</p>
<p>doing the the liver body type eating</p>
<p>plan</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>very good we have an answer from our</p>
<p>brilliant audience to the question which</p>
<p>asked what is the only trigger for</p>
<p>muscle growth the only one and uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a not a complete</p>
<p>consensus here uh 65 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s the muscle stress</p>
<p>or exercise that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d vote for 10</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s protein 10 say it&rsquo;s sleep ten</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s a glutathione and the</p>
<p>other five percent say it&rsquo;s insulin</p>
<p>so if you were to lay there and I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>bed and raise your insulin are you going</p>
<p>to wake up with bigger muscles</p>
<p>or if you um</p>
<p>just lay in bed and eat a lot of protein</p>
<p>is that going to build your muscles</p>
<p>um the answer is no it is basically that</p>
<p>the stimulus the intensity of the</p>
<p>the tension on your muscles Okay so</p>
<p>um you want to use this thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called um</p>
<p>exercise and you wanted and the more</p>
<p>intense the better especially if you</p>
<p>allow the body to recover so it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>exercise thing that will</p>
<p>stimulate the growth of the muscle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other things are needed to allow</p>
<p>that to happen you need protein you need</p>
<p>nutrients you need vitamins you need</p>
<p>rest for sure</p>
<p>um you need hormones but the exercise is</p>
<p>the main driver of the muscle</p>
<p>hypertrophy</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>you want when you work out you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to just do repetitions for the sake</p>
<p>of doing repetitions you want to</p>
<p>put that muscle under a certain amount</p>
<p>of stress to create some little injury</p>
<p>but you know we call that uh you know do</p>
<p>it to failure to the point where you</p>
<p>really hit that intensity to the point</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t go anymore you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>more gains especially if you allow your</p>
<p>body to recover I did a video on this</p>
<p>um versus just doing a low intensity</p>
<p>high volume you&rsquo;re not going to get big</p>
<p>muscles so you want that high intensity</p>
<p>short duration but</p>
<p>um bring it to failure and do a few of</p>
<p>those sets that would be very</p>
<p>therapeutic</p>
<p>to then grow your muscles all right very</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s uh go back to social media uh</p>
<p>Sandra from Facebook what would you</p>
<p>recommend for an overactive thyroid</p>
<p>I would take thymine B1 is a good remedy</p>
<p>for that and you want to avoid</p>
<p>um iodine and then you cruciferous</p>
<p>cruciferous foods are also good for that</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but the B1 and higher Amounts is going</p>
<p>to be beneficial and I did a video on</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hyperthyroid or Graves</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so watch that video okay very good we</p>
<p>had a question earlier I didn&rsquo;t ask it</p>
<p>but a woman said she was having</p>
<p>difficulty finding your videos or</p>
<p>organized in Facebook and ma&rsquo;am we have</p>
<p>a remedy for that and that&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>Dr Berg free app I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free it&rsquo;s so useful but he refuses to</p>
<p>charge any of you for it so go to Apple</p>
<p>or Android and grab that and find joy in</p>
<p>a complete organization of the various</p>
<p>videos and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s um let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>oh Betty Betty from uh how can I stop</p>
<p>passing gas and having trapped gas all</p>
<p>the time betaine hydrochloride is not</p>
<p>working poor thing is flatulent okay</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s other reasons for gas other</p>
<p>than a lack of stomach acid is probably</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re eating and um it probably</p>
<p>definitely is what you&rsquo;re eating so you</p>
<p>want to through a process of elimination</p>
<p>um start to eliminating certain foods</p>
<p>the most common causes of gas would be</p>
<p>like beans legumes uh fruit especially</p>
<p>fruit sugar alcohols all the things that</p>
<p>cause gas I mean start bloating</p>
<p>will cause gas</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>we got we gotta isolate that by having</p>
<p>lesser amounts of ingredients in your</p>
<p>foods and try just like eating a couple</p>
<p>things and see if you have gas or not</p>
<p>the other thing I would look at is the</p>
<p>um you might need probiotics as well</p>
<p>that can help you</p>
<p>all right very good and let&rsquo;s see if we</p>
<p>got a quick one here Rose from YouTube</p>
<p>please discuss the causes and treatment</p>
<p>for uh Vitiligo is that the</p>
<p>skin deal</p>
<p>this is a lack of pigment on your skin</p>
<p>where your skin just completely is kind</p>
<p>of white and it could be</p>
<p>an excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being produced coming from some</p>
<p>stressful situation usually people that</p>
<p>are like or go always going through</p>
<p>stress and um the adrenals are involved</p>
<p>uh you have a problem with melanin so um</p>
<p>I would start taking a lot of B1 start</p>
<p>changing the um</p>
<p>changing your um</p>
<p>your your whole um attitude towards</p>
<p>stress to keep a stress-free life as</p>
<p>much as possible so be one and very low</p>
<p>stress would be very therapeutic and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also other things you can do to</p>
<p>um get rid of hydrogen peroxide and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I actually have some videos on that this</p>
<p>coming week on that note I want to thank</p>
<p>all of you for uh your attention this</p>
<p>far have a wonderful weekend I will see</p>
<p>you next week same time same place</p>
