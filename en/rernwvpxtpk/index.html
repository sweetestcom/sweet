<p>Ôªøhey guys dr. Berg here I&rsquo;m doing this
webinar on how to basically understand</p>
<p>what symptoms mean and evaluating your
body symptoms based on what your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to tell you now this is
pre-recorded because the last webinar I</p>
<p>did it wasn&rsquo;t the slides weren&rsquo;t synced
to my video so basically I was over here</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like three slides behind so I
want to just create up a video that</p>
<p>works so you can follow along okay so so
I&rsquo;m going to give you a lot of thumb</p>
<p>very cool if insights into what certain
symptoms mean because the problem in</p>
<p>healthcare is there&rsquo;s the management of
symptoms there&rsquo;s no real understanding</p>
<p>of what symptoms mean and what you
should do about them so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>take it one step deeper look at the
cause-and-effect relationships so you</p>
<p>could kind of spot something and know
what&rsquo;s behind it and it&rsquo;s all related to</p>
<p>nutrition and we&rsquo;re going to look at
more visual things versus like</p>
<p>sensations like let&rsquo;s say fatigue or
that type of thing or depression we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to look at skin nails hair lips
like if you can look at either someone</p>
<p>or yourself and identify certain
problems I can I&rsquo;m going to teach you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind it okay so let&rsquo;s get
started let me just go right into the</p>
<p>slides okay
evaluating your nutritional deficiencies</p>
<p>now the first thing I&rsquo;m going to cover
is I&rsquo;m going to cover a little bit on</p>
<p>the nails so we have if you&rsquo;re looking
at either your nail or someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nail a lot of things can go wrong with
the nail number one you can have</p>
<p>horizontal ridges that&rsquo;s a b1 deficiency
vitamin b1 deficiency so if you have</p>
<p>these ridges that go horizontal you need
b1 now vitamin b1 by the way is the</p>
<p>first B vitamin that was ever discovered
in the B family and then it goes vitamin</p>
<p>B two and three and four and five and
six</p>
<p>the first item that was ever discovered
was vitamin a and then B then C then D</p>
<p>and then he that was my dry sense of
humor but that&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>develop these or discover these vitamins
but b1 is the first B vitamin that they</p>
<p>discovered and basically it creates a
series of problems but the nail is a is</p>
<p>a good way to identify if you&rsquo;re
deficient in b1 all right so horizontal</p>
<p>ridges all right now there&rsquo;s a couple
other deficiencies that occur with b1</p>
<p>one is cyanosis and what is cyanosis
basically cyanosis means that your</p>
<p>circulation of your nail so let me just
show you a picture that you got these</p>
<p>white nail beds so if you ever look at
people and they just completely look way</p>
<p>too white that is a b1 deficiency
because vitamin b1 is involved in</p>
<p>circulation so it&rsquo;s kind of a white nail
also you can have an enlarged heart on</p>
<p>the right side of your heart yep the
left and right side of the heart the</p>
<p>right to the heart is influenced by me
b1 and so when you&rsquo;re deficient the</p>
<p>heart starts to get weaker and it starts
to enlarge or atrophy and it shows up as</p>
<p>something bigger on an x-ray like you&rsquo;ll
see in a large heart that&rsquo;s cardiomegaly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really a b1 deficiency so the B
vitamins are intimately involved in the</p>
<p>heart function the other thing is that
you&rsquo;ll have problems with the eye</p>
<p>muscles you ever see people will they
have like wandering eyes or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re cross-eyed whatever that is a
weakness within the nerves to the eye</p>
<p>primarily the sixth cranial nerve and
that&rsquo;s also influenced by b1 okay be</p>
<p>when the efficiency can also cause edema
in your ankles so if you ever see people</p>
<p>like like let&rsquo;s say you press into the
ankle and it leaves a dent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a b1 deficiency
now a lot of times people like wonder</p>
<p>like how do I get a B vitamin deficiency
how do I get a b1 deficiency normally um</p>
<p>the history of this was involved with
people consuming too much polished rice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically refined rice when they
take all the nutrition out of the whole</p>
<p>rice and they basically have this
refined white rice creating a b1</p>
<p>deficiency so and the same thing happens
with grains if you have this whole grain</p>
<p>with all this B these B vitamins and
then you strip it down you refine it you</p>
<p>turn into flour white flour and then
they bleach it you&rsquo;re going to create a</p>
<p>problem with b1 and the other B vitamins
and that&rsquo;s why they enriched divided</p>
<p>flour with synthetic vitamins you&rsquo;ll see
this flour is enriched okay but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really enriched with synthetic vitamins
it&rsquo;s not the real thing</p>
<p>so b1 and other B vitamins fishin C&rsquo;s
are created by consuming too much</p>
<p>refined foods specifically the grains
white rice flour as in bread pasta</p>
<p>cereal crackers biscuits while both
pancakes</p>
<p>even white sugar okay so that&rsquo;s how you
create a b1 deficiency and just from a</p>
<p>subjective symptom of b1 deficiency
you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of nervous</p>
<p>tension like you&rsquo;re gonna have worry
you&rsquo;re going to have anxiety you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a lot of this buildup of
stress low tolerance to stress that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>b1 deficiency I mean how many people
have that so stress can deplete the B</p>
<p>vitamins and so can sugar and so can
refined foods okay okay let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>brittle nails now brittle nails
typically people they go a lot of women</p>
<p>they get their nails done and they keep
putting surface shellac on it and nail</p>
<p>polish and they try to strengthen the
nails and they do all these things to</p>
<p>try to fix the nail but if I was doing
now I could actually identify brittle</p>
<p>very easily by determining the
nutritional deficiency fixing that and</p>
<p>helping the person correct the real
problem versus just filing it down but</p>
<p>brittle nails is usually a another B
vitamin deficiency specifically biotin</p>
<p>which has another name for vitamin H but
biotin will Craig brittle nails because</p>
<p>biotin is involved with the
strengthening of proteins amino acids in</p>
<p>collagen that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really good for
hair but if you take too much of biotin</p>
<p>over time it can create a problem with
causing deficiencies of other vitamins</p>
<p>and people can get acne so so I&rsquo;d like
to look at the whole picture and not</p>
<p>just try to fix a vitamin but look find
out why you&rsquo;re deficient in a certain</p>
<p>vitamin you know it has to do with your
diet now how do you become deficient in</p>
<p>biotin well several ways number one you
can eat a lot of raw egg whites okay</p>
<p>like when people put raw eggs in their
shakes and things that can create a B a</p>
<p>biotin deficiency another way would be
to you either find foods another way</p>
<p>which is connected with your gut see
certain friendly bacteria in your gut</p>
<p>make biotin so a lot of people that are
deficient in vitamin have an imbalance</p>
<p>in their digestive system so they need a
good probiotic to build up that biotin</p>
<p>okay so those those are some of the
things that that can happen</p>
<p>another thing with biotin deficiency
would be the little the cuticle you get</p>
<p>all these peeling on your cuticle that&rsquo;s
a biotin deficiency and one good source</p>
<p>of biotin is nutritional yeast okay you
can get it from Amazon I would</p>
<p>personally recommend going to Amazon and
getting the non fortified nutritional</p>
<p>yeast which basically is without
synthetics a lot of times nutritional</p>
<p>yeast they enrich you with synthetics
which is it is a problem but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>minor problem because naturally a
nutritional yeast has a lot of natural B</p>
<p>vitamins so it&rsquo;s not just all synthetic
so it&rsquo;s less of a problem if you have a</p>
<p>combination but I mean if you&rsquo;re going
to get it from Amazon might as well get</p>
<p>the the non fortified 100% natural B
vitamins now why don&rsquo;t they sell natural</p>
<p>B vitamins in a pill it&rsquo;s very rare to
find it it&rsquo;s very expensive for example</p>
<p>if you they were to make biotin in a
pill in a supplement it&rsquo;s roughly about</p>
<p>eight hundred dollars a kilogram which
is 2.2 pounds</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 2.5 or 2.2 pounds that&rsquo;s
eight hundred dollars right if you would</p>
<p>buy it synthetically it&rsquo;s like maybe
nine or ten dollars per kilogram so all</p>
<p>these vitamin D fashion companies are
not giving you the natural version</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving you a synthetic which
come with problems down the road if you</p>
<p>take too much of it or too long a period
of time I&rsquo;m ok with taking synthetic</p>
<p>vitamins if they&rsquo;re for a detox but any
other reason I don&rsquo;t like them so how do</p>
<p>you know if it&rsquo;s natural or not you have
to look at the source of where they get</p>
<p>the vitamin and anything that&rsquo;s like
over like if it says like six thousand</p>
<p>percent times the normal value or even a
thousand times normal in the back of</p>
<p>label you know it&rsquo;s synthetic
because you can&rsquo;t put that much natural</p>
<p>vitamin in a pill so that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
seeing all these synthetic vitamins</p>
<p>nowadays but anyway biotin deficiency
can create a lot of problems of your</p>
<p>nails hair and definitely the cuticle
and this is it keeps the nail nail shop</p>
<p>in business alright let&rsquo;s go on the next
one vitamin B</p>
<p>deficiency it creates a redness around
the nose the cheeks and even the top of</p>
<p>the forehead this is a b6 deficiency and
call it rosacea whatever you can call it</p>
<p>psoriasis it&rsquo;s just a redness around
that the nose area and on the nose as</p>
<p>well so it&rsquo;s interesting the B vitamins
create a lot of skin problems and a lot</p>
<p>of digestive problems a lot of hair and
nail problems so you&rsquo;ll see as we go</p>
<p>along so that&rsquo;s the b6 deficiency again
where do you get b6</p>
<p>b6 is actually easy to get from most
foods</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an eggs it&rsquo;s in vegetables it&rsquo;s in
a lot of different foods but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually the foods that are like junk
food that pulls it out like refined</p>
<p>carbohydrates breads pasta cereal
crackers biscuits waffles pancakes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s pulling it out and yes it
could be an allergy to gluten and things</p>
<p>like that but um I mean someone people
are living on refined foods this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s causing it okay a zinc deficiency
will create those little white little</p>
<p>specks on the nail but if you the nail
grows every six months so if you see a</p>
<p>white speck let&rsquo;s say in the middle of
the nail that&rsquo;s like three months ago</p>
<p>you created that white speck now if
we&rsquo;re looking at the nail right here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably if we divide this now by
six it&rsquo;s probably like maybe two months</p>
<p>twenty percent of the nail two months
ago</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a zinc deficiency that was
created now what causes a zinc</p>
<p>deficiency eating a lot of carbon
carbohydrate like in sugar so we can</p>
<p>pretty much tell about a month about two
months ago they had a birthday party and</p>
<p>they ate the whole cake by this white
speck on their nail so they ate a lot of</p>
<p>carbohydrate and so and I do this people
and they&rsquo;ve kind of freaked out like how</p>
<p>did you know that
well because I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m actually reading</p>
<p>and interpreting what your body is
trying to tell me I understand the</p>
<p>language and this is what we&rsquo;re trying
to do in as webinars to teach you how to</p>
<p>read your body okay that&rsquo;s the zinc
deficiency but it&rsquo;s really a sugar</p>
<p>deficiency the trace minerals which is
like zinc which basically trace minerals</p>
<p>are minerals needed in smaller amounts
um like selenium iodine zinc mulignan</p>
<p>things like that versus the bigger
minerals like calcium magnesium sodium</p>
<p>potassium needing needed in larger
amounts but we need the small trace</p>
<p>metals most people that I run into our
deficient in trace minerals because the</p>
<p>trace minerals are no longer in the
soils um unless you get food from places</p>
<p>that have volcanic soils I was in
Grenada which is an island which is</p>
<p>basically they grow this chocolate this
cocoa bean and they have the soils are</p>
<p>so rich with these volcanics these
minerals from the volcano that it gives</p>
<p>incredible flavor to the cocoa bean and
Switzerland and Belgium get their</p>
<p>chocolate from the island or they get it
from Africa the same deal in Africa they</p>
<p>have the volcanic ash and the soil is
rich and it gives the flavor of the food</p>
<p>and I tell you I believe that a lot of
people&rsquo;s that can live in the areas</p>
<p>where they had volcanic ash in the soils
they they don&rsquo;t seem to gain weight that</p>
<p>much even if they eat you know whatever
they eat they also have good bone</p>
<p>structure they don&rsquo;t have a lot of
problems with their dental structure so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find these trace metals
nowadays but that&rsquo;s a zinc deficiency</p>
<p>thyroid thyroid problem will create
vertical ridges up and down so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>classic symptom vertical we just
the thyroid will also create a lot of</p>
<p>other things like loss of collagen in
the back of the arm</p>
<p>so will the adrenal and also it creates
problems with hair loss and it will</p>
<p>create issues with bags with the eyes
and a loss of the eyebrow on the outer</p>
<p>part so these are just little things
that you can look at if you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>identify yourself and again I like to
look at the whole body and not just take</p>
<p>one little symptoms that you have this
deficiency I look at all the symptoms</p>
<p>and for those of you that as we go
through this want to know like what</p>
<p>foods are high in certain nutrients I&rsquo;m
going to share a download little button</p>
<p>link below that you can download all
these deficiencies like um basically</p>
<p>where to get zinc what foods are high in
vitamin A etc so give you that data when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done okay here&rsquo;s a condition
inflammation in the mouth and the lips</p>
<p>do little ulcers on the lip you&rsquo;ll see
them or skin rashes and things like that</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another condition which
is inflammation in the corner or angles</p>
<p>of someone&rsquo;s mouth called angular
chalasis or Chile&rsquo;s and that and you see</p>
<p>that a lot in kids or even in adults
where you have this little cracking in</p>
<p>the corners of the mouth this is the
vitamin b2 deficiency riboflavin um</p>
<p>personally I used to have this growing
up course I lived at refined foods so</p>
<p>definitely it&rsquo;s a b2 deficiency again
where do you get b2 it&rsquo;s in nutritional</p>
<p>yeast it&rsquo;s in and it&rsquo;s basically what
you have to do to avoid having a</p>
<p>deficiency of it by avoiding the sugars
and the refined carbohydrates and all</p>
<p>that so let&rsquo;s go into the next one b3
deficiency vitamin b3 deficiency it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called pellagra now what is that it
there&rsquo;s a condition called glove and</p>
<p>stocking lesions where you have this
severe scaly red irritated skin on</p>
<p>and the feet that&rsquo;s a very severe b3
deficiency okay so you ever see it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it means
but look what causes pellagra consuming</p>
<p>too much corn or consuming too much
alcohol because corn is not very</p>
<p>nutrient dense and that can create a
deficiency especially the corn that</p>
<p>people eat nowadays it&rsquo;s GMO it&rsquo;s the
corn syrup and all that crap okay</p>
<p>b2 deficiency riboflavin here&rsquo;s another
one a bloodshot eyes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a b2 deficiency jaundice now what
is jaundice jaundice is a backup of the</p>
<p>liver into the bloodstream where you
have a liver problem and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>your whites of your eyes are going to LA
you&rsquo;re skin will be tainted yellow this</p>
<p>is a congested gallbladder or a
congested liver now if someone consumes</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they consume a lot of carrot
juice for example they will turn yellow</p>
<p>eventually or kind of an orange
that&rsquo;s not jaundice that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>pigment that&rsquo;s coming out that&rsquo;s its
Inanna it&rsquo;s not a problem it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>serious problem it just means that you
got you&rsquo;re doing too much carrot juice</p>
<p>and again carrot juice is just way too
much sugar we don&rsquo;t want to do that I</p>
<p>used to do a lot of characters I thought
it was good for me but it basically</p>
<p>started creating blood sugar problems
cuz there&rsquo;s so much concentration sugar</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s vitamins in it it&rsquo;s
still very very unhealthy okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating the whole carrot is is better
okay let me just go back to these slides</p>
<p>ok jaundice vitamin A deficiency now
vitamin A um is almost like a hormone</p>
<p>just like vitamin D it&rsquo;s a fat type of
vitamin it can go into the DNA of your</p>
<p>cells it can determine what your what
cells turn into like if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem
with vitamin A you have this weird</p>
<p>growth on your skin on the eye and you
can even have like a white little shell</p>
<p>or pigment right over your the black
part of your eye the iris so you can</p>
<p>also have these little growths on your
on your the whites of the eye as well so</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be right over the eye
could be on the side of the inside of</p>
<p>the outside that&rsquo;s about an innate
efficiency so anything to do with</p>
<p>vitamin A without skin or acne I always
go to buy diamond a but what foods are</p>
<p>high in vitamin A you say vegetables yes
it&rsquo;s true but all vegetables like</p>
<p>specially like kale have tremendous
amount of minute amounts like even with</p>
<p>spinach it&rsquo;s like 30,000 in I use of
vitamin A but that&rsquo;s all a pre vitamin A</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the actual active form of
retinol which is vitamin A that you can</p>
<p>use so it has to be converted into the
body and with some people they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>convert it that well some people they
can but an average you might convert 4%</p>
<p>so where do you get your vitamin A from
the fats from the butter from the oils</p>
<p>from the column oil but if your
gallbladder and your liver is congested</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the bile to break down
the vitamin A so so a lot of vitamin A</p>
<p>deficiency has come from a problem with
the liver of the gallbladder and if you</p>
<p>especially like you don&rsquo;t have the
gallbladder they become deficient in</p>
<p>vitamin A so these are just kind of side
notes so you might take bio may and not</p>
<p>see any change but I&rsquo;ve noticed that
when people start eating healthier and</p>
<p>they clean out the liver or they support
the gallbladder all us and their skin</p>
<p>gets really good and their acne goes
away that is because you&rsquo;re absorbing</p>
<p>more about it maybe because you&rsquo;re
getting more bile output file is kind of</p>
<p>like the detergent and salt dissolves
the grease okay one of the classic</p>
<p>symptoms of vitamin A deficiency has
night vision issues you can&rsquo;t see at</p>
<p>night
everything comes blurry especially if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bright oncoming traffic lights
you&rsquo;ll you have a</p>
<p>with them that&rsquo;s the vitamin A
deficiency now as you age and the liver</p>
<p>gets more congested you can even lose
your just your vision you notice like</p>
<p>when you get in your forties fifties
like your vision is just so bad that</p>
<p>could be about emanate efficiency as
well but it&rsquo;s really a liver problem</p>
<p>okay okay next slide here&rsquo;s another
vitamin A deficiency it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>these little fever like by some chicken
look at the skin you see those little</p>
<p>follicles your little red little bumps
on the skin that and if you have that</p>
<p>like on your skin or behind the arm
that&rsquo;s a vitamin A deficiency I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you anything well with skin is
usually connected vitamin A so so far we</p>
<p>have three main deficiencies that most
people have a problem with that involve</p>
<p>the skin the hair the nails so which is
basically like protein you have the fats</p>
<p>all the vitamins the trace minerals and
the B vitamins those are the ones that</p>
<p>always show deficient in a lot of people</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another B 2 B 3 deficiency
cracked corners of your heel like your</p>
<p>heels get really really dry that&rsquo;s a b2
b3 deficiency so if you put lotion on</p>
<p>that thing you&rsquo;re just treating the
symptom but it&rsquo;s interesting you go to</p>
<p>medical doctor you go to the
dermatologist which they have in every</p>
<p>corner in Florida I mean I went down
there I&rsquo;m like wow they have so many</p>
<p>dermatologists and all they&rsquo;re doing is
they&rsquo;re giving you cortisone creams for</p>
<p>everything for skin problems doing
biopsies but they&rsquo;re not even getting</p>
<p>close to the root problem at all
alopecia okay what is that Ella pichia</p>
<p>is a biotin deficiency could be adrenal
problems but it&rsquo;s using a biotin</p>
<p>deficiency so you start getting these
spots of loss of hair but again if your</p>
<p>diet is fairly good it&rsquo;s probably coming
from your gut you have some digestive</p>
<p>maybe you just a problem maybe you had
it semantic biotics maybe you had some</p>
<p>leaky gut issues that could be coming
from</p>
<p>something in the past and you&rsquo;ve never
got your digestion fixed so you got to</p>
<p>look at the whole whole picture here
just taking biotin is not the answer the</p>
<p>answer is getting your whole diet
corrected</p>
<p>biotin is also good for male pattern
baldness and also thinning hair let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just touch on male pattern baldness in
females and men a lot of times they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s an energy and efficiency but
in reality if that was true why do men</p>
<p>have male pattern baldness well as they
age when at the same time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>antigens their testosterone is
decreasing how can that be</p>
<p>I mean if antigens are testosterone
excessive amounts of estrogen or herbs</p>
<p>or excessive amounts of testosterone
cause now part of all this doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense because it decreases with age well
what happens really it&rsquo;s an estrogen</p>
<p>excess that&rsquo;s converted to a powerful
estrogen called DHT so it&rsquo;s an estrogen</p>
<p>problem men and women it&rsquo;s just
converted so if you have the right ratio</p>
<p>to estrogen to testosterone you won&rsquo;t
have this problem so and this is a side</p>
<p>note if you have a problem with this or
you&rsquo;re getting a loss of hair and then</p>
<p>in the head or in a male body you&rsquo;re
getting prostate problems a really good</p>
<p>remedy to help kind of correct the
ratios of estrogen to testosterone is</p>
<p>something called stinging nettle root so
get some of that that&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>a prostate and also male pattern
baldness and also if you&rsquo;re just losing</p>
<p>hair and you&rsquo;re female of course your
own prostate go ahead and take it as</p>
<p>well okay iodine deficiency creates an
enlarged thyroid in your neck or Gore&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or nodules in the thyroid see here&rsquo;s how
if you&rsquo;re all these little cysts on the</p>
<p>thyroid on the breast on the ovaries
come from excessive estrogen but see</p>
<p>iodine protects the excess of estrogen
so it competes with estrogen so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient iodine estrogen can
create a lot of damage to your your body</p>
<p>especially a female body so if you have
good amount of iodine in the diet from</p>
<p>seek help which I recommend get the
organic kind because if you just get</p>
<p>regular you know seek help from the
store it might be contaminated with</p>
<p>arsenic you want to get something from
Iceland or something that&rsquo;s organic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really healthy but here&rsquo;s the
point I then and will actually decrease</p>
<p>estrogen and it actually is a good
cancer preventer and it actually handles</p>
<p>cysts nodules of the thyroid of the
breast fibrocystic breast of the ovary</p>
<p>very very important the tongue if it&rsquo;s a
red tongue that&rsquo;s a b2 deficiency if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a glossy red tongue that&rsquo;s a b12
deficiency a white tongue is a yeast</p>
<p>overgrowth okay so that&rsquo;s a yeast and
balance that&rsquo;s a gut problem fissures in</p>
<p>the tongue it&rsquo;s a b12 deficiency it can
happen like down the center on the sides</p>
<p>these well be vitamin deficiencies now
you see the outer part of the eye the</p>
<p>eyebrow it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no hair there
that is a thyroid problem and you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about the thyroid is
the thyroid blocks the absorption of</p>
<p>nutrients in the body so really it&rsquo;s a
nutrient deficiency but the thyroid can</p>
<p>create the nutritional deficiency so
again you know you need to understand</p>
<p>how the whole body works now this is a
real common thing I see a lot of people</p>
<p>you see like a pink toothbrush like you
get bleeding gums or or red swollen gums</p>
<p>they call it gingivitis that&rsquo;s about it
and C deficiency it&rsquo;s a form of scurvy</p>
<p>because vitamin C strengthens the
capillary beds so anything like micro</p>
<p>hemorrhaging up like those varicose
veins spider veins the little red cheeks</p>
<p>anything with vascular
things like that that&rsquo;s about in-situ</p>
<p>pitch vitamin C deficiency but what&rsquo;s
happening at the cellular level is they</p>
<p>even in your arteries you&rsquo;re getting
little lesions and bleeding in the</p>
<p>arteries and that&rsquo;s when you have the
accumulation of cholesterol as a</p>
<p>band-aid and calcium has abandoned in
the arteries and then you get a clogged</p>
<p>artery so these people that have
gingivitis really have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>developing problems in the vascular
system as well but if you have brush</p>
<p>your teeth and you get bleeding that&rsquo;s
about NC deficiency do not take the</p>
<p>synthetic vitamin C get it from the food
concentrated food I use the wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice powder myself but you can get it
from just a lot of vegetables as well</p>
<p>versus one juice has no vitamin C
because it&rsquo;s pasteurized but they put</p>
<p>some synthetic in there so don&rsquo;t take
the synthetic now if you have too much</p>
<p>fluoride which a lot of times in the
water supply they use too much flora</p>
<p>that can create that discoloration in
the tooth and that creates an imbalance</p>
<p>in calcium metabolism so I mean it&rsquo;s
like that everyone&rsquo;s like so Pro</p>
<p>fluoride but it&rsquo;s very toxic to your
body actually if you&rsquo;ve been follow me</p>
<p>you know about the body types if you
look on if you someone has a heavier</p>
<p>hips
that&rsquo;s an ovary type if they have a</p>
<p>health side belly that&rsquo;s adrenal type if
they&rsquo;re weight all over that&rsquo;s a thyroid</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s more of a protruding belly
that&rsquo;s a liver problem okay so you can</p>
<p>look on the outside of the body and
determine what&rsquo;s going on the inside it</p>
<p>chief foot on the bottom of the foot
that is a liver problem it&rsquo;s a liver</p>
<p>issue just wanna let you know um
neuromas what&rsquo;s an aroma it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>nerve bundle on the bottom of the foot
that can be very painful to do search</p>
<p>around it that&rsquo;s a virus viruses come
out of remission when your dreams are</p>
<p>weak you can&rsquo;t kill a virus because a
virus is not alive mix blindness so</p>
<p>viruses are very fascinating they
basically maybe get activated and to get</p>
<p>inactivated
they get activated by your own tissues</p>
<p>when you become tired stressed out
burnt out get older the viruses come out</p>
<p>of remission and they create all sorts
of damage like shingles and herpes and</p>
<p>all these other issues but when you&rsquo;re
healthy they go back into remission but</p>
<p>the adrenals control if it&rsquo;s going out
or in so you can&rsquo;t kill a virus or do</p>
<p>your only solution is to get healthy but
it&rsquo;s interesting because viruses usually</p>
<p>come out when you go through stress
they&rsquo;re activated okay now um so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to recommend I developed
I spent a lot of time creating an</p>
<p>advanced evaluation questionnaire it&rsquo;s
kind of a free test someone can go on</p>
<p>and this is the URL the address online
that you can go to that you can take</p>
<p>this lengthy evaluation and I&rsquo;ll explain
exactly what the heck this thing is I</p>
<p>created this quiz awhile ago and it has
104 questions it has every single</p>
<p>symptom you could possibly imagine and
what I did in my spare time is I took</p>
<p>every single symptom and I evaluated all
of the potential causes of that one</p>
<p>symptom then what I did is I I created
logic so when you were to fill out this</p>
<p>quiz it associates with other symptoms
so it looks at other symptoms that you</p>
<p>have and all those potential causes to
find the most like likely cause the</p>
<p>number one cause of all of your symptoms
okay so that&rsquo;s it actually thinks so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on automatic pilot so you don&rsquo;t
need a practitioner to tell you what it</p>
<p>is so so what I did is I created this
quiz and then I kind of gave I wanted to</p>
<p>not just evaluate and tell you what your
problem is but to help you understand</p>
<p>and interpret what that means and and so
you can have a greater deeper background</p>
<p>of the symptom and what you should be
eating</p>
<p>and what remedies would be good for you
both additional remedies like a pelvis</p>
<p>door or just general remedies things
like that to actually now just treat</p>
<p>symptoms but we want to treat the cause
of the symptom and correct it okay so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a training program as
well as an evaluation software okay</p>
<p>then what I did is I created all the
potential to fish causes of problems</p>
<p>like low vitamin b1 low fat soluble
vitamins low B to low potassium and I</p>
<p>created all the symptoms that could
occur from those causes so when you take</p>
<p>this quiz it died sex everything and
comes up with a really cool freakin</p>
<p>report that you will love okay so and
then I have all these different remedies</p>
<p>that you can use to actually correct it
so um here&rsquo;s what I recommend that you</p>
<p>do take the quiz you go to dr. Berg com4
slash evaluation take the quiz and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a short quiz it&rsquo;s a long quiz it&rsquo;s
104 questions but it&rsquo;s awesome because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll actually dissect everything for
those people that are under my</p>
<p>membership site they can take it every
month but I&rsquo;m just letting you two take</p>
<p>it as a one-shot deal for free normally
I&rsquo;ll charge for it because one of my</p>
<p>health coaches will contact you just
kind of review it and then send you the</p>
<p>report
okay so just help you understand it and</p>
<p>then you can go through it at your
leisure and just start to learn from it</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s a I think it&rsquo;s a very cool
evaluation and I&rsquo;m gonna allow you to</p>
<p>take you know one evaluation and that is
basically your next step and let me just</p>
<p>kind of put this up on the screen to
you&rsquo;d go to dr. Berg comm forward slash</p>
<p>evaluation and um you&rsquo;re basically going
to just fill out the thing and it might</p>
<p>take us a day or two to get back to you
because we&rsquo;re going to analyze it look</p>
<p>at it and then contact you walk you
through it</p>
<p>you know take a couple minutes and then
what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll send you the</p>
<p>report and you&rsquo;ll have a really cool
assessment of what&rsquo;s going on to your</p>
<p>whole body and the underlying deeper
root problem that that that you need to</p>
<p>focus on because you know my whole thing
is this stop treating symptoms let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>treat the cause of it let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go
deeper your results are dependent on</p>
<p>getting the real problem and so if
people get results um then they&rsquo;re they</p>
<p>can actually resolve a problem and
there&rsquo;s nothing worse and I see this all</p>
<p>the time with people basically treating
symptoms and they keep treating symptoms</p>
<p>they never get to the root of it and
they keep going and keep going and they</p>
<p>just get frustrated so to go the doctor
of this specialist so this quiz is about</p>
<p>an advanced evaluation technology
evaluation means finding a real cause</p>
<p>understanding what the body&rsquo;s trying to
tell you like like even if you have pain</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s trying to tell you don&rsquo;t
move right if you pain when you eat</p>
<p>something what does your body trying to
tell you avoid that food so this is all</p>
<p>about trying to understand what the
language of the body is in interpreting</p>
<p>symptoms okay so anyway that&rsquo;s the quiz
and I wanted to share just some insights</p>
<p>on that with going through the different
assessments but now you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>look at someone um three feet away and
kind of spot what they&rsquo;re deficient in</p>
<p>which is good and bad because you&rsquo;re
gonna probably now want to evaluate</p>
<p>everyone you know just don&rsquo;t much my
name I can just see you now like do you</p>
<p>know how to be to deficiency yeah maybe
people might not accept that but this is</p>
<p>good for friends and family so I hope
you enjoyed this webinar I hope you</p>
<p>learned something and your next step is
to take the evaluation and I appreciate</p>
<p>your attention thus far you made it this
far and I will see you in the upcoming</p>
<p>videos so thank you very much and I will
see you soon</p>
