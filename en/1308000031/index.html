    <p>Shout out to a company Saxon</p>
<p>Despite how tired of am you I&rsquo;ve woken up now now. I&rsquo;m awake. You&rsquo;ve awakened. I&rsquo;m done. I quit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a shout out to</p>
<p>You which just got acquired by</p>
<p>Plugs</p>
<p>Rain man David</p>
<p>Hey everybody, welcome to the all-in podcast, I&rsquo;m Jason Calacanis with us today</p>
<p>The rain man himself calling in from an undisclosed location the queen of quinoa and of course the dictator himself Chamath</p>
<p>Pali apatia</p>
<p>All right, boys, how are we doing? Feel flow energy today? What&rsquo;s going on? Great. How are you? What&rsquo;s going on? Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this. I love it. Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>All right, you&rsquo;re hot. You&rsquo;re coming in hot. Wow. Yeah, breaking news breaking news</p>
<p>Biden has announced</p>
<p>His capital gains tax hike. I don&rsquo;t think this impacts any of us, but</p>
<p>Biden will proposed almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals from 20% to</p>
<p>Not 25 not 28</p>
<p>39.6% to help pay for the social spending</p>
<p>and in</p>
<p>Equality for those earning 1 million or more</p>
<p>Earning 1 million or more so nobody on this call federal tax rates could be as high as 43.4</p>
<p>The capital gains increase would raise 370 billion over a decade</p>
<p>yada, yada for new yorkers the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as</p>
<p>52.22 percent and californians</p>
<p>56.7 percent biden has previously warned that those earning over 400 000 can expect to pay more in taxes</p>
<p>This was just breaking news a couple of hours before we started the pod</p>
<p>and the stock market is uh</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>And people are freaking out. We should do it. Jake. I want to hear your take on this actually</p>
<p>I want to start with your take. Why did you tell me body was gonna do this? I would have voted for trump</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t tell me this is gonna hit me so hard. No jake jake. I was ranting on this topic 15 minutes ago</p>
<p>We were talking and i&rsquo;m like dummy. What did you think was gonna happen? You know?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sitting there going off. He&rsquo;s sitting there going off</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what did you expect just before we get into it?</p>
<p>We should do a quick primer on what this means, right?</p>
<p>So capital gains taxes are the taxes you pay when you make an investment and you sell that investment at a profit</p>
<p>The you pay a tax on the profit you make and there&rsquo;s a difference between capital gains on the short term</p>
<p>Which means less than one year and long term, which means you&rsquo;ve had the investment for more than a year</p>
<p>So economic policy historically has dictated that having a low capital gains tax rate relative to what you know</p>
<p>An income tax rate might make it might be</p>
<p>Incentivizes people to make long-term investments and it you know gets more money moving in the economy and as a result</p>
<p>You know the economy will grow and so the idea of increasing the long-term capital gains tax from 20%</p>
<p>Which it currently is to 40%</p>
<p>Is a real striking, you know economic policy shift</p>
<p>Rationalized as you know, we&rsquo;re going to save, you know, we&rsquo;re going to use this money for social spending</p>
<p>But I think the historical context and what this is is really important as we get into the conversation</p>
<p>And just speaking historically, you know, the the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains</p>
<p>got up to</p>
<p>40%</p>
<p>Zach, you probably have the history on this in 1978 for a year, right? Or like 76 to 78</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s been largely, you know, 15 to 20% for the last 20 years or so</p>
<p>And so to jump up and prior to that in the early part of the 20th century</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 25% pretty consistently for a long time. So to jump up to 40% is a really big shift and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debate around the economic implications of doing this. I thought that was important</p>
<p>yeah, let&rsquo;s take a step back and actually see the forest from the trees and the forest from the trees is that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think biden</p>
<p>Thinks that it&rsquo;s a credible plan in as much as I probably think</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>He needs, you know, this is like it&rsquo;s performative</p>
<p>Because it was a lot larger the number the headline number was a lot larger</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>What people were whispering was going to be the number right?</p>
<p>It was supposed to be like in the low 30s or maybe kind of like, you know, 33 34</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden like to come out of 39.6, I think it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>Okay, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s giving the pound of flesh to</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>the the left</p>
<p>Kind of like woke mob of the democratic party</p>
<p>Who probably doesn&rsquo;t understand how capitalism works in the first place and doesn&rsquo;t care because they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not participants in it now</p>
<p>My reaction is I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to pass. I think it&rsquo;s going to be really tough to get done</p>
<p>and I think it probably</p>
<p>You know, maybe maybe there&rsquo;s a watered down version, but this version I and i&rsquo;m not super</p>
<p>Worried about and then it just comes back to the same thing over and over</p>
<p>the the fewer the number of people that get to participate in the growth and see the upside the more there are that just</p>
<p>wants to just kind of</p>
<p>You know tear it all down and so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just yet another signal that we have these structural issues to fix</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reasonable that a few people get super rich and everybody else gets left on the sidelines</p>
<p>Sax where your thoughts it&rsquo;s not going to pass but it&rsquo;s not going to pass</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to tax. Is it going to pass? Is it an opening salvo where he wants to get to 32?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s starting at 39</p>
<p>I think I think it could pass because I think they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re planning to do this tax increase as part of the the second</p>
<p>Infrastructure bill. It&rsquo;s not really an infrastructure bill. They&rsquo;re calling it human infrastructure</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this infrastructure is one of the last categories of federal spending that&rsquo;s still popular</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re rebranding a bunch of social programs as human infrastructure</p>
<p>Um, I think that bill will pass. I don&rsquo;t know if the the rate will stay at 39.6</p>
<p>But I think there will be a big increase clearly</p>
<p>In the the cap gains rate, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>Remembering how it got to 20. It got to 20</p>
<p>because bill clinton lowered it from 28 to 20 as part of an overall package of um,</p>
<p>of of tax reforms that he did in the in the sort of the the mid 90s</p>
<p>And you know that led to some of the best years of economic performance gdp growth in the u.s productivity growth</p>
<p>uh deficit reduction</p>
<p>um, you know, and so</p>
<p>You know, I think we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re we are experimenting with breaking something that&rsquo;s been working. I think pretty well</p>
<p>since the the reagan clinton years</p>
<p>Uh, which is to have you know, reasonably low</p>
<p>Taxes on capital formation and investment</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a category error to treat capital gains or to think about it just as income</p>
<p>You have to remember that all this money has already been taxed once right? So you make the money the first time</p>
<p>As income you earn it you pay tax on it</p>
<p>Then you decide to save some of it and invest it and then you get taxed again on that amount and um,</p>
<p>So so capital gains is a form of double taxation</p>
<p>Uh, that was the original reason one of the reasons to to have a different tax rate for it</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know, I think that this risk kind of</p>
<p>Messing up the economic recovery that&rsquo;s really underway already, by the way</p>
<p>Think about um, what just happens to</p>
<p>Any organization that has to pay cap gains, right? It&rsquo;s not just individuals like</p>
<p>Um last time I checked organizations aren&rsquo;t exempt from cap gains, um for-profit organizations</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t exactly know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>What they will do as well. So, you know you you you&rsquo;re putting a lot of people under a huge strain when you double</p>
<p>the the effective rate of return so, you know, if you&rsquo;re for example, like</p>
<p>Um a pension fund right and you have an enormous investment in a private equity fund or a hedge fund</p>
<p>Um part of these things is that you know, they&rsquo;re these complete pass-through vehicles</p>
<p>Um, and so as long as like you&rsquo;ve structured yourself in a way where you don&rsquo;t have to pay that tax</p>
<p>I think I guess you&rsquo;re indifferent, but if you&rsquo;re any organization or institution or a person or a collection of people</p>
<p>That bears that tax all of a sudden</p>
<p>You know your returns have been basically cut in half</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty nuts. Let&rsquo;s talk about the average Joe for a second</p>
<p>Or Jane as it were</p>
<p>401ks</p>
<p>Would take a hit here and then when you go to your retirement and you have to liquidate them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t pay tax on the you don&rsquo;t pay tax on that. Yeah, you don&rsquo;t pay tax on the 401k gains during</p>
<p>Otherwise your portfolio because 401k is going to be a small amount you can contribute to you every year</p>
<p>So retirees who happen to have stock market gains or cryptocurrency people trading that yeah</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll basically pay the same as income tax as opposed to paying</p>
<p>a lower tax</p>
<p>So would a it&rsquo;ll diminish investment jason?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what david says which is that on the on a marginal basis</p>
<p>What will happen is inflation probably goes up because people just decide to consume</p>
<p>Rather than invest because they think well, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s already risk that I bear and so, you know</p>
<p>The the earliest risk assets right the riskiest ones that we all participate in which is early stage venture and company formation</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s you you may not be thinking about the capital gains rate</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s implicit in the returns that you&rsquo;re expecting for the risk and the time you&rsquo;re going to take</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;ve been trained to feel that rate</p>
<p>And if you double that rate from 20 to 40, I suspect that there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>Whose risk tolerance changes and they&rsquo;re going to feel their after-tax gains differently and they&rsquo;ll wonder to themselves</p>
<p>Is this worth it? And then I think what happens as a result is</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship drags. I don&rsquo;t know if anybody&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>uh an analysis, but I suspect part of the reason why america is such a</p>
<p>You know an amazing like sink for capital, right? It absorbs capital all around the world</p>
<p>Is that you&rsquo;ve created incentives that get people very excited because they think they can get rewarded</p>
<p>If you take those rewards away</p>
<p>I think the implications are much bigger than just the cap gains rates here because as the people change their behavior</p>
<p>Then the capital formation pools outside of the united states change their behavior</p>
<p>And the whole thing has a knock-on effect and it was more muted in clinton</p>
<p>It was less muted in 78. It basically didn&rsquo;t exist in the 40s and 50s, but it is</p>
<p>A huge force today. I mean like we are an indebted nation that owes money</p>
<p>To all kinds of countries around the world including china. We&rsquo;re supposed to generate growth and sort of pay it back</p>
<p>And where will the growth come from if lps don&rsquo;t want to back venture funds or venture funds?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, you know, maybe i&rsquo;ll check out let&rsquo;s be honest and direct. I mean are any of you guys going to change your</p>
<p>Investment behavior if the cap gains tax goes to 40</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;ll be less of it</p>
<p>You know, so look anything my behavior has changed. I think my behavior will change. Yeah, how will it change?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s exactly what david said. So I just put in a hundred million dollars into a climate change company two weeks ago</p>
<p>Uh under this promise, uh, I could only put in 50</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s 50 million less progress that&rsquo;s going to happen on that business</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure that that was that&rsquo;s the right answer for</p>
<p>What that company is trying to do in the world?</p>
<p>And the way you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re saying the profits you would have had from before are diminished in half</p>
<p>Therefore you would only have half as much money to invest as an investor</p>
<p>right, so so however way you want to cut it whether it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>10 companies gets cut down into five or the five 10 companies that I invest in get half my money</p>
<p>The point is at some point</p>
<p>The money starts to run out not just for me, but for everybody else</p>
<p>Yeah, basically at the end of the day the money goes into the hands of you know</p>
<p>Government legislators and administrators to decide how that money gets spent</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not in the hands of uh</p>
<p>Capitalist investors to decide where to invest that that&rsquo;s the fundamental kind of</p>
<p>Shift that that&rsquo;s going to happen, right capital capital&rsquo;s been taken out of the economy risk</p>
<p>Capital&rsquo;s been taken out of the economy and it&rsquo;s now going to be you know spent by by government look anything that you</p>
<p>Tax you punish and disincentivize and anything you subsidize you you create an incentive for there to be more of</p>
<p>and you know, so this is just</p>
<p>We always talk about these things in terms of who they&rsquo;re going to hurt. Is it the you know?</p>
<p>This only falls on the backs of rich people</p>
<p>Um, so we shouldn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>But the real question is what is this going to do to the economy?</p>
<p>And you know, I think we&rsquo;ve talked in previous podcasts the last part that we have with brad gerstner</p>
<p>It feels like everything in the american system is kind of broken except for one thing</p>
<p>Which is this sort of opportunity economy that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s being created by</p>
<p>Risk capital right and and people creating new companies, you know, like these big</p>
<p>Stultifying political corporations the sp500 are completely broken government&rsquo;s completely broken. The federal debt is out of control</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s the media is broken</p>
<p>Everything in america is either broken or needs to be revitalized or reformed except one thing is working really well, which is</p>
<p>Risk capital and its allocation to founders who have nothing but a good idea, right?</p>
<p>And when all of a sudden you double the cap gains rate that is an attack on that opportunity society now</p>
<p>I think there is</p>
<p>A legitimate conversation to be had about how do we spread?</p>
<p>This sort of system of opportunity to more and more people</p>
<p>I think like brad framed it really well in the last episode</p>
<p>Like how do we get more people involved in that?</p>
<p>I would submit the answer has a lot to do with school choice and charter schools giving people everyone in this country</p>
<p>Deserves to have a first-rate education</p>
<p>Um, and so that is a very legitimate conversation to have but I think to have punitive taxation on it</p>
<p>Is I think it risk breaking</p>
<p>That last thing that is working so well in in the american system. I think it&rsquo;s really well said and uh, I think this is going to</p>
<p>Take re-domiciling to another level. I mean if you&rsquo;re in new york or california right now and you were thinking</p>
<p>about wyoming or utah or</p>
<p>texas or florida, I mean this kind of makes the decision for you if it does go to 40 and</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>But you could actually meet would you get to neutral if you left?</p>
<p>And so I remember I remember when I moved to the united states in 2000</p>
<p>The marginal tax bracket that I was in and I was making maybe, you know 100</p>
<p>No, I was probably making</p>
<p>80 or 90 thousand dollars a year was 55</p>
<p>And I remember coming to the united states and seeing my after my take-home pay my first paycheck and I was shocked because I was</p>
<p>Like, you know, I was paying maybe 36 all blended in federal and local at the time or state at the time in california</p>
<p>And slowly slowly it&rsquo;s creeping up with with if you play it out today where we are plus new york state just passed laws</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be sort of in the 50 to 55 percent almost upwards of 56 percent for certain folks</p>
<p>And maybe the answer is that&rsquo;s the right thing</p>
<p>Um, but I think we have to acknowledge that there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of unintended consequences</p>
<p>So maybe the intended consequence is to actually create more</p>
<p>um equality between the richest few and</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>uh, not even the poorest frankly because but it&rsquo;ll just be the richest few and</p>
<p>The the next richest few quite honestly because like, you know, the investing class is still a small number of people</p>
<p>um, but the unintended consequences of that decision I think is what exactly what david said which is that</p>
<p>Over the next five or ten year period you will at a practical level</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>less investment</p>
<p>And the the only way to make that hole is if the government then takes all that money</p>
<p>And all of a sudden allocates it from their own coffers back into the economy and we know that that&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>Well, right that&rsquo;s just going to be riddled with waste and graft and corruption</p>
<p>So unfortunately the setup is that you know, you&rsquo;re going to really impact entrepreneurship</p>
<p>and then and then I wonder to myself by the way guys like</p>
<p>What was the actual goal of this meaning there was 20 or 30 guys that were just making so much money on their equity</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s then then we need to blame like the</p>
<p>these lists like the forbes billionaires list because those are inaccurate because a lot of these stuff is like</p>
<p>unrealized</p>
<p>Realized paper gains. Yeah, right</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not paying any capital gains because they haven&rsquo;t sold anything and most of these guys that are uber uber rich</p>
<p>You know have no desire to sell because it&rsquo;s for them. It&rsquo;s a control issue to sell</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure. I&rsquo;m not sure the consequence of taxing uber rich people is the true motivation</p>
<p>I think for some people maybe it is</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>If we just take a step back, I mean a year ago</p>
<p>The u.s. Debt level was significantly lower than it is today</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken on a tremendous amount of of federal debt to fund a series of programs that we believe we&rsquo;re going to kind of keep</p>
<p>Um, you know the american population employed and keep our economy moving</p>
<p>Um, that was a massive burden we accrued and in the past year so ultimately over time</p>
<p>The only way to kind of support this this new federal budget</p>
<p>And um, you know the this new servicing costs that we&rsquo;ve taken on at the government level</p>
<p>You really only have kind of like three options option</p>
<p>One is you&rsquo;re going to continue to raise more debt and massively kind of inflate everything and the dollar declines in value</p>
<p>Option two is to reduce spending</p>
<p>Which means starting to cut these programs and option three is to raise taxes</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty clear that option one is one where we&rsquo;re kind of already at the economic limit</p>
<p>Option two is going to be very hard to swallow at a time like this. So you can&rsquo;t just cut spending right now</p>
<p>Across the board so many aspects of the u.s</p>
<p>Economy and so many individuals in the united states are dependent on the federal government for support</p>
<p>And so option three is the only real one that&rsquo;s left on the table</p>
<p>And so then the question is who are you taxing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to go tax the people that are struggling</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to tax the corporations and the wealthy and the capital gains tax is the one place where you can kind of say look</p>
<p>The tax rate that you&rsquo;re paying today is half of what an income tax rate would be if you were earning that as income</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it to be fair and even and I think just just to argue this other side</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a motivation. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a point of view where this is coming from</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just let&rsquo;s go tax the rich screw the economy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we find ourselves in a circumstance where we need to do one of those three things the most rational to do is to</p>
<p>Or the most kind of sensible politically</p>
<p>To do is to is to increase taxation and this is the the first place to go the most obvious place to go</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because so when you think about like, so for example, like, you know, you would say okay</p>
<p>Who are the folks that we&rsquo;re talking about there can be entrepreneurs that are building companies again</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never selling so they&rsquo;re never going to pay these taxes</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not the case that elon musk or mark zuckerberg is all of a sudden going to write a 40 billion dollar check because</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not how much they make that may be how much they&rsquo;re worth</p>
<p>But they will never sell a single share unless they have to to fund some other project in which case</p>
<p>So which of those three things would you do tomorrow?</p>
<p>So so what I was going to say is so and then and then you look at somebody else like maybe you say</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know the people that manage money like let&rsquo;s go after those guys because like those guys shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>You know rich but then the problem is those guys are already paying w-2 income. They&rsquo;re already paying nominal income tax rates</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the entire hedge fund industry works right now, you know, um, you get paid in current income</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And so okay, so you&rsquo;re not getting their money because they&rsquo;re already paying at the prevailing rate</p>
<p>So again, this goes back to if you actually trace the problem and see who it affects. It&rsquo;s exactly what david said</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these folks that are in the middle</p>
<p>That are actually putting the money to work that are trying to invest in things that now have a very different return profile</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right the core business that they do they may still keep doing</p>
<p>But then all of the incremental things in the future that they want to do they won&rsquo;t do for example</p>
<p>Look at all of the talk right now about how everybody needs to stand up</p>
<p>You know more angel investing more minority investing more women gps all of this stuff</p>
<p>Well all of the folks let&rsquo;s just be honest all the folks that were in a position</p>
<p>To put money into those folks</p>
<p>Are now 50 on a dollar rated basis poorer if this thing passes</p>
<p>And I bet you what they&rsquo;re going to do is they&rsquo;re not going to cut their allocations in sequoia</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to cut their allocations to all these other folks. Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking</p>
<p>Chamath is I who&rsquo;s it going to hurt? It&rsquo;s again</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to hurt all the people that you want to get into the game</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to hurt all the people that are here</p>
<p>But the richest richest rich folks that is not unless you impact but unless you x appropriate the money from them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not going to get a single cent and then that was the that was the concept of the wealth tax</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it that you would take the total value what you have and just take away one percent a year</p>
<p>From bezos&rsquo;s, you know or zuckerberg&rsquo;s hundred billion dollars</p>
<p>So would that not have been a better solution than this if you had to pick one a one percent?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s people over whatever jason</p>
<p>Then then we&rsquo;re no better than a banana republic that could also then</p>
<p>expropriate a mine because we don&rsquo;t like the way that the mining is happening or you know</p>
<p>Another critical asset because the government decides that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the difference between a stock and any other asset that either a person or or a corporation owns?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very uh, I think that the definitions are thin. They&rsquo;re all the same things at the end of the day</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back. Let&rsquo;s go back to the federal budget problem. Like how do you address it sax?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the right course here?</p>
<p>What I think is amazing is we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re about to spend we&rsquo;re raising this</p>
<p>Hundreds of billions of taxes in order to fund, you know trillions of new spending</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really hear the administration selling</p>
<p>These new programs selling the spending all we&rsquo;re really talking about is that there&rsquo;s too many rich people</p>
<p>We have these millionaires and billionaires. We gotta tax them more</p>
<p>And so all all we&rsquo;re really talking about is whether it&rsquo;s appropriate to be punishing</p>
<p>The rich and super rich. We&rsquo;re not really talking about where&rsquo;s this money going? Are these programs justified?</p>
<p>What do we get out of it exactly and my point is forget about like who it&rsquo;s gonna hurt</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s eventually gonna hurt the economy</p>
<p>And the question is what do we get out of it?</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s amazing is this isn&rsquo;t even paying for the big ticket items on the progressive wish list. We&rsquo;re not getting to</p>
<p>universal</p>
<p>Health care with this. We&rsquo;re not getting to universal higher education</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not getting to any of the we&rsquo;re not getting to like forgiveness of student loans or anything like that</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not getting to any of the really big ticket items on the progressive wish list</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re maxing out the taxes relative to anything. We&rsquo;ve done historically</p>
<p>And so where do you go from here?</p>
<p>You know because my thinking is this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the progressive agenda</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that speak to the problem like the fact that we have such an extraordinarily</p>
<p>high</p>
<p>Debt burden and federal budget that we&rsquo;re kind of scrambling to figure out a way to kind of make ends meet effectively, right?</p>
<p>I mean because our alternative again is to just let massive inflation run</p>
<p>You know issue a ton of a ton of new debt or to cut spending. No, no, but david</p>
<p>Either of those seem to be on the table. No, no, you&rsquo;re going to exacerbate this issue</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m telling you I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely but I think on a marginal basis. This will be an incentive to spend</p>
<p>And the reason is that it&rsquo;s a very frustrating idea for somebody to think about putting money in the ground</p>
<p>especially a sophisticated investor</p>
<p>Um at a rate of return that just changed in half</p>
<p>And so from my perspective, I would be more likely to spend because I would rather just yolo the money</p>
<p>Then I would rather put it into the ground because I would be worried</p>
<p>That that could then get taken away from me. It could also change even further and further and I think that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>Frustrating idea i&rsquo;d rather take a vacation again. Let&rsquo;s go back to the example</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather take a vacation with that ten thousand dollars</p>
<p>then go on to jason syndicate and put it into the hands of folks because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just like you know what it&rsquo;s going to turn into even if even if jason hits it and I get back</p>
<p>You know, i&rsquo;d rather just go on vacation</p>
<p>Enough of those decisions and I think I think you have a very different kind of economy</p>
<p>You have you know what you have you have what everybody else has so do we reduce spending?</p>
<p>I think you have to reduce expenses</p>
<p>I think that we have an infrastructure that is not well accounted for meaning if you&rsquo;re a company</p>
<p>You can go to a company like tableau</p>
<p>You can go to a company like, you know, pick your pick your metrics company and within you know</p>
<p>A few weeks and months of work you can literally understand where all the dollars are, right?</p>
<p>You can understand your business and you can figure out where money is being wasted and where it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>In a government that&rsquo;s impossible to do, right?</p>
<p>Because you have these laws and these laws are artificial constructs that we construct and those artificial constructs are influenced</p>
<p>By money in and of itself and so these dollar flows are impossible to map</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know where it goes. So for example</p>
<p>The 700 billion dollar budget in the pentagon</p>
<p>Does anybody have any idea what the roi is on that or even a way to measure it like even to actually make it simple?</p>
<p>Well, like if you were if you had 700 billion dollars of investment capital</p>
<p>The the market has a really simple way of saying. Okay, david</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your roik? What&rsquo;s your return on invested capital and you can say all kinds of fancy things</p>
<p>You can have all kinds of fancy projects or simple projects</p>
<p>But at the end of the day</p>
<p>What is measurable is a dollar in and what that dollar grew into and that&rsquo;s a return on invested capital</p>
<p>It is impossible to know that</p>
<p>And so, you know, we could say for example, you could define it and say well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to basically get every single person to graduate high school</p>
<p>And now i&rsquo;m going to spend 500 billion dollars a year to make sure that the graduation rate is 100</p>
<p>That would be an incredible goal. You know what that is absolutely measurable, right?</p>
<p>And and you&rsquo;d be able to back into all of these programs and the one that&rsquo;s ones that didn&rsquo;t work you&rsquo;d cut</p>
<p>You know, and you&rsquo;d end up with what david said, which is school vouchers</p>
<p>I mean just I think I think the absence of that accountability</p>
<p>Chamath has led us to a scary dilemma and the dilemma is</p>
<p>Over 10 million americans are directly employed by federal government</p>
<p>And a large swath of the remainder of the economy is supported by federal government spending which is basically your point, right?</p>
<p>So large amounts defense and military construction healthcare and pharma</p>
<p>I mean the list goes on but like the direct employees of the federal government plus the amount of revenue that depends on federal spending</p>
<p>Is so significant now as a percent of the total income generated by americans</p>
<p>That it is very hard to say like let&rsquo;s create accountability in a system</p>
<p>When so much of the economy is functionally dependent on it. Am I missing something sacks?</p>
<p>Like I mean, isn&rsquo;t that the circumstance we&rsquo;re in right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean the thing that like is amazing to me is you know</p>
<p>I lived through the 1980s and 1990s like like you guys did from 1982 to 2000 that 18-year period we had</p>
<p>Sort of an unrivaled economic performance. It was roughly around we had two bad years under george herbert walker bush</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he lost re-election, but we had close to 40</p>
<p>growth in gdp</p>
<p>Every year we had great productivity</p>
<p>Um, and we had massive deficit reduction. It&rsquo;s the last four percent a year</p>
<p>Yeah, and we and we had we we actually had government</p>
<p>Surpluses budget surpluses the last few years. So it seems to me that we had the winning formula</p>
<p>As a country and look this is not partisan. I think it&rsquo;s bipartisan. I think it&rsquo;s the the right solution is somewhere</p>
<p>between what what reagan and and bill clinton did</p>
<p>and you know clinton</p>
<p>Uh, he rose he increased the individual tax rate to 39.6. So he did do that</p>
<p>From 36 percent, but he cut it from he cut the investment to the cap gains rate from 28 to 20</p>
<p>It was in that ballpark, you know, we know that works, you know, we know that works I and and and you know</p>
<p>somehow we&rsquo;ve moved away from what we learned in that time period because you know, I think the</p>
<p>The left in this country has has become</p>
<p>Kind of you know has embraced this we&rsquo;re saying the same thing you set up the incentives for people to invest</p>
<p>They do if you set up the incentives for people to spend they will do that as well</p>
<p>I see this I think chamath is exactly right</p>
<p>There are a lot of people and you use the example of the syndicate.com</p>
<p>When I do my syndicate deals, there are people who are recreationally saying, you know what?</p>
<p>I love the idea of putting five or 10k into a flyer</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna you know, half of them will go away a third of them all these people who are you know involved in</p>
<p>Day trading or crypto or real estate investing they&rsquo;re going to look at and say is this worth the time?</p>
<p>Or is it worth this amount of time?</p>
<p>Maybe i&rsquo;ll cut back from doing 40 hours a week of this to 20</p>
<p>And if you look at what happened crypto people, they went to puerto rico</p>
<p>You look what happened to venture capitalists and ceos. They went to florida. Miami austin</p>
<p>This is going to</p>
<p>If it does pass you could be pushing people to singapore</p>
<p>Well, we have another very complicated problem and this is what freeberg brought up which is and I don&rsquo;t know the answer david</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m trying to i&rsquo;m actually talking around your question because I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the right absolute question</p>
<p>But think about this what happens in a world where now let&rsquo;s just say that the revenue of the government goes up, right?</p>
<p>But outcomes stay the same or get worse</p>
<p>And at the same time and you could claim that that&rsquo;s effectively what&rsquo;s been happening over the last 20 or 30 years, right?</p>
<p>Government revenues have gone up impact has stayed the same or probably been net negative</p>
<p>But then at the same time you have this, you know program of quantitative easing where then you can essentially print money on demand</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>When you think about that, it&rsquo;s like wait a minute. I am giving you money</p>
<p>But then then you are also going to the photocopy machine with my money to make more money</p>
<p>And all of that total money does less than what it did when it was half that or a quarter or a third of it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very scary realization. I think that people, you know will eventually come to</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the answer to that is I you know</p>
<p>I I I think David</p>
<p>Saksipu said it was just like, you know</p>
<p>The states are this incredible a b test right because you get to test like theories</p>
<p>Right, and you have you have now every complexion of theory you have like, you know</p>
<p>The low-tax states the no-tax states the mid-tax states you have high real estate taxes low real estate taxes highest state tax, whatever</p>
<p>You get every grab bag of incentives</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to see but the problem is that was assuming that the federal government kind of mostly stayed out of the way</p>
<p>Right when you have this massive overlay</p>
<p>Yeah, I just posted a chart in the the chat that nick can put up which is federal spending federal outlays a percentage of gdp</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really interesting because</p>
<p>Federal outlays of percent of gdp have generally been</p>
<p>Around the 20 percent line plus or minus a couple of percent</p>
<p>Since you know the 1980s</p>
<p>And last year in 2019, it was 20.7</p>
<p>It jumped to 31</p>
<p>0.3 percent under covid and it now feels like we&rsquo;re trying to make this new level</p>
<p>Of you know going from 20 to 30 permanent. It&rsquo;s like mask mask wearing</p>
<p>Well, the the problem is the only time we did that in history was in world war ii</p>
<p>Now we were trying to fight the nazis which was worth spending the money on yeah</p>
<p>I would say that was a good use of capital, but it&rsquo;s very hard to step back, right?</p>
<p>I mean what&rsquo;s the ruin what what starts out as temporary becomes permanent? Is that kind of the concern?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what milton freeman said is there&rsquo;s nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program</p>
<p>right, uh</p>
<p>but but but what they&rsquo;re threatening to make permanent is this new permanently higher level of federal spending in the economy and</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very dangerous experiment because it either takes</p>
<p>Tremendous money printing to support it or a tremendous tax burden and neither one of them is good for the economy</p>
<p>By the way, you know again when bill clinton left office</p>
<p>I remember, you know, you can go to the the time machine for whitehouse.gov</p>
<p>When he left in 2000 and he bragged about how</p>
<p>Under his terms under his eight years as president. They reduced federal spending from 22</p>
<p>What happened to that to 18 of the economy?</p>
<p>Can you imagine a democrat today boasting of that or even a republican? I mean</p>
<p>What who was the guy who was your guy who was like, uh, the tea party people?</p>
<p>There was somebody who was like in charge of the senate. Well, I don&rsquo;t know who it was, but it was just like we got to cut spending</p>
<p>Radically cutting. Oh, yeah, ryan. Yeah speaker the the speaker of the house paul ryan. Yeah</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re right on this. Yes</p>
<p>Spending restraints kind of gone out the window and in both parties and the republic and it did it did happen under trump</p>
<p>The republicans don&rsquo;t seem to find their principles on spending unless and until there&rsquo;s a democrat in the white house</p>
<p>So they definitely deserve their share of the blame on this</p>
<p>But but we do seem to be entering a new territory here of you know this again</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Levels of spending we&rsquo;ve never seen before. It&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely the problem. The problem is it would be so much better</p>
<p>If we just said we&rsquo;re going to do this one very specific thing</p>
<p>With a huge number attached to it. Like I would rather say we&rsquo;re going to mars. Here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a trillion dollars</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re cutting student debt. Here&rsquo;s a trillion dollars. We&rsquo;re going to double down on cyber and we&rsquo;re going to get you know</p>
<p>Completely pivot the military or something and here&rsquo;s 500 billion</p>
<p>Whatever something aspirational that is not just anti-rich people. Let&rsquo;s tax right now</p>
<p>We have we have labels</p>
<p>We have a label and then we have a spaghetti mess of spending that just isn&rsquo;t really attached to what the label means</p>
<p>And none of it is accountable. And so you don&rsquo;t really get anything for it</p>
<p>I know this is a silly question, but why wouldn&rsquo;t we test this and say hey 20 40</p>
<p>There are numbers between these two</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll increase it two percent a year for eight years</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see what happens. This is the this is the other problem with like this idea of american exceptionalism</p>
<p>We believe that we can&rsquo;t learn anything from anybody else and that&rsquo;s also not true</p>
<p>We actually know what it looks like when you have government as a massive portion of the economy</p>
<p>And we also know examples where government basically enables human capital outcomes, but remains relatively, you know, small and fixed</p>
<p>Singapore right there&rsquo;s this there&rsquo;s this incredible. Yeah, you know, there&rsquo;s this incredible example where I think uh, right when liquan you became</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>The head of singapore the gdp of singapore was the same as the gdp of jamaica</p>
<p>Right, and what you saw was this complete just just complete divergence in in these two countries and think about this country</p>
<p>Which is basically this like, you know this little spot of land</p>
<p>Surrounded, you know, and you know a political a religious surrounded by these muslim countries and they still thrived and they kicked ass</p>
<p>You know, they were never invaded etc, etc</p>
<p>And underneath that was this belief that it&rsquo;s what you said freeberg where you focus on an outcome</p>
<p>You spend against the outcome and you try to measure in a reasonable way</p>
<p>And you double down on the things that work and then on the other hand if you look at europe europe is a good example</p>
<p>When you know spending sometimes for the greater good in the best interest can run amok</p>
<p>And really what happens is you start to stagnate?</p>
<p>Yeah, and singapore is only what six million people. I mean, it&rsquo;s like ireland or norway or denmark</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s this is not a huge place. Sounds like we didn&rsquo;t solve any problems in that last piece</p>
<p>Yeah, we didn&rsquo;t solve it. I mean, I mean, what do we think is going to happen in four years?</p>
<p>Does donald does this give donald trump a clear path into office if he said hey, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Again, you know the worst case scenario is you see what happened in france when they had that 75</p>
<p>Super tax and then they introduced the wealth tax and they had massive emigration of</p>
<p>Of uh invested dollars out of the country and people out of the country. They did get rid of george</p>
<p>That was a bonus</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>At what point how many red pills do you guys have to take?</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re willing to reassess your political party because it seems obvious to me now. Look we can talk about our political party</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on. We can talk about we can talk about how bad the republican party is, but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>Question on my mind that the democratic party all the energy the base the activists and the politicians who have the microphone</p>
<p>They are woke socialists. Okay, that is the dominant ideology in the democratic party and what biden is doing right now</p>
<p>Is catering to that he&rsquo;s compromising. He wasn&rsquo;t catering to that until this point</p>
<p>He he didn&rsquo;t put bernie or elizabeth warren into any cabinet positions. He kind of marginalized them and now</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, okay, let&rsquo;s do something. I mean would warren and this is this is why I think yeah</p>
<p>No, but jason, I think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>This is why I think this is like a sacrificial lamb and I don&rsquo;t think anything&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I think biden is a fundamental centrist. That&rsquo;s why I like him. I think he&rsquo;s a boring</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a stable. He&rsquo;s a stable predictable figure and that&rsquo;s I think what you want in the in the presidency</p>
<p>I I think that this is sort of like okay, you guys want a pound of flesh here you go</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s so politically</p>
<p>Smart that he probably does have a bunch of millennial woke socialists whispering and chattering like hey do this do that to the other</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s probably the only one there who&rsquo;s smart enough to realize none of this won&rsquo;t get passed</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not going to muster enough support. I don&rsquo;t know. I think biden is not governing like a centrist right now</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s proposing, you know, what four trillion of new spending, you know new tax increases and he&rsquo;s just getting started</p>
<p>But look and I would challenge this idea just slightly of him being a centrist</p>
<p>What I would say is he&rsquo;s always tacked to the center of the democratic party</p>
<p>so I I do I I do think he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s a triangulate triangulator and</p>
<p>A calibrator. He&rsquo;s not like a conviction politician the way that a bernie sanders is or an elizabeth warren</p>
<p>But what he&rsquo;s tacked to is the center of the democratic party and the center of the democratic party</p>
<p>Has moved very far left because all the activists have moved to the left and so he&rsquo;s been dragged left remember</p>
<p>Biden was clinton&rsquo;s floor manager in the senate when he passed all this</p>
<p>legislation</p>
<p>And so now biden is very far to the left of where biden was</p>
<p>In the 1990s and the reason for that is because the democratic party has moved</p>
<p>So once again, I guess, you know, my question to all of you guys is what does it take?</p>
<p>How far does the democratic party have to go to the left of trump?</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t call this the problem is don&rsquo;t call this as much of a radical policy shift as I think it&rsquo;s being framed</p>
<p>I honestly think this is a natural and inevitable consequence of the circumstances</p>
<p>We find ourselves in right now with respect to the spending level</p>
<p>The dependence we have on federal spending across the board with respect to individual employment and the economy</p>
<p>The need for a variety of social services to get us through this covid economic collapse. I just don&rsquo;t see another way</p>
<p>Out and I feel like it&rsquo;s the natural course to do exactly what&rsquo;s going on right now</p>
<p>I I think it&rsquo;s going to pass. I think something like it&rsquo;s going to pass</p>
<p>And I think something like it&rsquo;s going to pass but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to pass. Yeah</p>
<p>Where do you put it at? You think it&rsquo;s going to be equidistant? I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s good or bad</p>
<p>I think obviously we just find ourselves in this circumstance in this country in this moment in time</p>
<p>That this is the only path. I&rsquo;m, just not sure you can go in and go slash a ton of spending right now</p>
<p>And and you know, and anyone would win re-election or any, you know, or most americans would be anything but unhappy</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just the consequence of where we are. Let&rsquo;s play the glass half full. Here&rsquo;s a crazy idea</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>You know, for example somebody like me what I would think about which I think is is a little it&rsquo;s crazy, but I would do it</p>
<p>Is okay. I&rsquo;m just going to move literally every single thing every dollar that isn&rsquo;t nailed down</p>
<p>Into a charitable vehicle and I will invest through my charity</p>
<p>Because I still have to donate five percent a year, but then I can compound tax-free</p>
<p>Now I care more about the businesses that i&rsquo;m a part of and the progress that I can create</p>
<p>So that may be okay and i&rsquo;ll just pay myself a salary to like fund my lifestyle</p>
<p>But that could be a way around this to me. The biggest issue isn&rsquo;t how much money I have</p>
<p>Personally, the biggest issue is how much money I will have to put back into the world</p>
<p>And the idea that then it goes to a place where it&rsquo;s profligately spent in a way that isn&rsquo;t accountable really bothers me</p>
<p>That idea bothers me a lot</p>
<p>David that would cause me to attack</p>
<p>you know more even more to the right if I could find somebody who understood that principle because what I don&rsquo;t want to have is</p>
<p>You know in the absence of social programs like the problem that the republicans leave is this no man&rsquo;s land where then you&rsquo;re forced to believe</p>
<p>That this one man for yourself. It&rsquo;s all about you. You can figure it out. You know the rugged individualism</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not realistic like I I</p>
<p>Am a complete byproduct of a social safety net and that should exist</p>
<p>And the problem is that republicans don&rsquo;t give you that option to have then accountability on spending and just somebody please just say that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you call yourself</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, I think you know that I think republicans have gotten a lot more comfortable with the idea of entitlements and the the social safety net</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really hear anyone opposing that anymore</p>
<p>Um, I mean, it&rsquo;s the same things happened with like the tories in</p>
<p>In england, you know, no one&rsquo;s really trying to roll back the social safety net</p>
<p>We need a republican messenger to come forward and say listen, we don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>You know who you love what you smoke where you&rsquo;re from what you look like</p>
<p>You know, we believe in an opportunity society</p>
<p>We want to spread that opportunity to everybody but ultimately opportunity comes from the private sector</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a strong social safety net and we&rsquo;re going to basically give everybody</p>
<p>The the most opportunity to participate by giving them a great education. That&rsquo;s basically what the agenda should be. Yeah, i&rsquo;m in i&rsquo;m in I mean</p>
<p>I I to your starting line. Hallelujah. I like it. I mean I I would</p>
<p>Problem is your boy tried to dismantle obamacare, you know</p>
<p>The problem is trump like trump i&rsquo;m a never trumper obviously, but i&rsquo;m kind of purple</p>
<p>I would you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m considering austin or miami as a as a place to locate myself and</p>
<p>A decision like this makes it easier. I would never do that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, actually very I I love texas. I love austin. Austin&rsquo;s the kind of purple I like</p>
<p>Like I like personal freedom and I like what you&rsquo;re saying like love who you love smoke what you want</p>
<p>What year did you move to the bay area?</p>
<p>five six years ago</p>
<p>I was in la for 10 new york for 30. I feel like it&rsquo;s a last in first out thing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going on right now with respect to immigration out of california. I&rsquo;ve been here since 2000. I&rsquo;m not leaving</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;ve been here my since I was six years old in california and i&rsquo;m not leaving and I and i&rsquo;ve been in the bay</p>
<p>Area since college so i&rsquo;m not you know, I feel like it&rsquo;s a lot harder</p>
<p>To leave when you&rsquo;ve been here longer and it&rsquo;s a lot easier to leave when you&rsquo;ve been here less time</p>
<p>That certainly seems to be the pattern i&rsquo;ve seen amongst friends and colleagues with respect to leaving the state</p>
<p>Uh, all right, uh, the chauvin trial, uh came back</p>
<p>guilty all three charges</p>
<p>What is there to even talk about here? What is there to talk about? I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>Can I get can I give it can I give a shout out to um</p>
<p>A really good friend of mine. His name is neil kachal. He was the former solicitor general under obama</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>he uh, he was uh, one of the</p>
<p>Prosecutors that that worked on that case. Um, he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a partner at hogan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Um runs a supreme court practice there, but basically went and did this pro bono trial</p>
<p>uh on behalf of the state of minnesota working with the the</p>
<p>The district attorney and i&rsquo;m just I just want to say neil proud of you. It&rsquo;s an incredible thing</p>
<p>Um, thank you for keeping</p>
<p>america sane</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I mean, uh, you know, it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>But then, you know the same day there was there was a shooting of this</p>
<p>This unfortunate shooting of this. I think I think she was 16 year old 16 years old this black girl in</p>
<p>Ohio and then you know lebron tweeted something out and then lebron had to basically delete the tweet because it was causing people to go</p>
<p>Absolutely crazy</p>
<p>Well, I mean each of these situations is unique</p>
<p>and in that situation somebody was going to stab another person the cop didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen and</p>
<p>You know in in another time period like maybe that would have been</p>
<p>saving somebody&rsquo;s life who had potentially been stabbed and</p>
<p>You know the george floyd, I think you got to reserve judgment on each of these</p>
<p>until you get all the information, but the information here was just super conclusive like</p>
<p>The the gymnastics ben shapiro and some of these far right people had to go through</p>
<p>To say what you saw in george floyd being murdered was not what happened</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s performative theater trying to get people to watch something and it was I mean</p>
<p>It was just gross to watch you might as well call it what it is like that&rsquo;s acting</p>
<p>I feel like probably if anybody if any one of us found ben shapiro in a bar and just hung out and had a beer</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d find out that he was like he was like the meryl streep of our generation, you know, like this incredible actor</p>
<p>Like an incredible actor</p>
<p>Scott adams and his podcast all these guys are just trying to figure out how to say</p>
<p>That this was a travesty of justice and i&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know what you saw. But yeah, let me explain where they went wrong</p>
<p>Okay, so so look I I agree with you guys fundamentally. This was an easy</p>
<p>Look, this this was uh, you know finding a fact by the jury guilty on all charges</p>
<p>Obvious right the tape shows it his uh, the chauvinist, uh record as a cop numerous complaints</p>
<p>You know, this was a bad apple. This was a bad cop. He deserved to be convicted end of story</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the analysis should end</p>
<p>But of course the people on cable news would have nothing to say if that was the end of it and</p>
<p>So look, I think both the right and the left kind of went off the rails on this where</p>
<p>You know, the right kind of went off the rails is you had well</p>
<p>What happened is you had maxine waters, you know come out and while the the jury was still deliberating</p>
<p>She was basically calling for activists to get more confrontation on the streets if the verdict went the wrong way</p>
<p>And so then the defense helpful not helpful, right and so that so then the the defense made a motion</p>
<p>Saying that uh, this this was affecting the deliberations</p>
<p>There was no proof of that the jewel the the judge ruled against that motion</p>
<p>But he did the judge reiterated his desire for the politicians to stop talking about the case, right?</p>
<p>and so then what happened is the the right-wing commentators</p>
<p>Were criticizing maxine waters and implying that that there was an effort to try and coerce the jury</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no proof of that right and and and and I think there&rsquo;s the mistake is in somehow framing</p>
<p>Derek chauvin as like a sacrificial lamb to the mob. He was not he was guilty</p>
<p>he deserved it that being said I do think that the judge had a point that it would be</p>
<p>Helpful if these politicians would just stay out of it stop commenting on it while the jury is deliberating</p>
<p>I think there was a legit point there. Um</p>
<p>But you know the the the left made some some weird comments as well. You had nancy pelosi made this really</p>
<p>Bizarre that was very strange. I think that was like a slip up of like</p>
<p>Just trying to say something. I mean being charitable. She was trying to say something nice</p>
<p>That george floyd is going to create a wave of justice and that&rsquo;s a great idea</p>
<p>She said yeah, she said thank you george floyd for sacrificing your life for for justice</p>
<p>Yeah, that didn&rsquo;t come out exactly as she no</p>
<p>No, I mean because look george floyd did not go out that day intending to be a martyr</p>
<p>No, you know and um, and so it it it sort of</p>
<p>It expressed kind of what she&rsquo;s thinking which is how am I going to use this politically?</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Train it came out pretty gross. I think you&rsquo;re right. It came out gross for sure</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re trained. It&rsquo;s kind of like, you know</p>
<p>If you if you take a finely tuned athlete in a sport and give them, you know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re reactive because they&rsquo;re so instinctual. I think it&rsquo;s kind of like this. She&rsquo;s an incredibly finely trained</p>
<p>Athlete in her domain is politics. And so, you know, what is that phrase? Uh,</p>
<p>Uh, every crisis is an opportunity kind of thing</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean they all flew there to be there for the for the trial etc</p>
<p>And that couldn&rsquo;t have helped the judge with you know, the impartial jury and maybe that causes a mistrial</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know david. You&rsquo;re an attorney</p>
<p>Is there any chance on appeal that a maxi?</p>
<p>water quote like that could</p>
<p>result in</p>
<p>Well, the judge actually said that that the defense could reserve that issue and use it on appeal</p>
<p>So, yeah, they could use it but but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to work unless they can prove</p>
<p>That somehow the jury was contaminated</p>
<p>by what they were hearing on tv or</p>
<p>judges instructions were pretty clear like I watched a couple of the ending days and</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very clear like he&rsquo;s like guys. I don&rsquo;t want you to watch the news, you know, there&rsquo;s stuff like that</p>
<p>He was very directive in making sure that they tried to be as uncontaminated as possible</p>
<p>So I think the the surface area for an appeal is pretty thin here</p>
<p>the fact that the police chief and everybody who worked with him said like</p>
<p>This is not standard this and they just threw him right under the bus</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with this in any way, by the way</p>
<p>Well, you know, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not going to be able to hide much longer though</p>
<p>Because the doj said they&rsquo;re opening an investigation at the minnesota police force</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re just trying to crack open the police reform in that state and just get those guys on the right side</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>You know again, here&rsquo;s this other issue where it&rsquo;s like, okay</p>
<p>This is where like there it&rsquo;s very difficult for the federal government to do anything</p>
<p>But you know</p>
<p>so whatever they try to do won&rsquo;t really result in what what you want to have because</p>
<p>Every state again jason to your point has completely different political ideologies</p>
<p>Nobody wants to behave the same everybody wants to be independent</p>
<p>Everybody wants to get re-elected as not kowtowing to somebody else</p>
<p>And so you just don&rsquo;t get these consistent outcomes and then people are forced to vote with their feet and move across the country</p>
<p>You know to get a bunch of simple things that I think should be pretty consistent across the entire country</p>
<p>The thing that I found just not particularly deranged was these people who are like listen, he&rsquo;s a fentanyl addict</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an opioid addict, which by the way, there are tons of affluent people. Everybody in this country is addicted to opioids</p>
<p>Fentanyls are everywhere fentanyl is everywhere and then you&rsquo;re trying to say like because he had that addiction</p>
<p>But in some way that negates the person kneeling on his back while he&rsquo;s in handcuffs</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re you have a duty as a police officer to take care of somebody when he&rsquo;s in handcuffs</p>
<p>how is he any threat in any way and then to</p>
<p>Listen to scott adams and ben shapiro on these</p>
<p>absolute</p>
<p>Pieces of garbage try to say oh, you know, there was the fentanyl that killed him. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, no the person on his back kneeling on him for nine minutes because it&rsquo;s about it&rsquo;s about ratings now</p>
<p>Switching topics and to talk about ratings something a little lighter</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>The most interesting popcorn thing that I watched, uh was the hulu documentary</p>
<p>You did watch the hulu documentary on we work. I uh, we work. Yeah</p>
<p>Watch it. I gotta watch it. I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet. Yeah, it is it is in a word</p>
<p>I think I think the good I think the right word is like</p>
<p>Outrageous, I think the guy who stole it. Jason was the lawyer who they interviewed. Yep</p>
<p>He he had some incredible kind of like one-liners. Yeah</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s yeah the</p>
<p>I had a g i&rsquo;ll be honest and this may sound crazy, but I actually had</p>
<p>um a fair amount of sympathy</p>
<p>For adam newman and watching it. I think that he</p>
<p>At least in the documentary it came out that he you know</p>
<p>Not not that he didn&rsquo;t create this issue</p>
<p>But that I think it was a little overly scapegoated because it&rsquo;s very hard for you to incinerate</p>
<p>45 billion dollars without the complicity at a minimum of your board of directors</p>
<p>Right and and a bunch of like extremely well-heeled thoughtful investors</p>
<p>And so there was just there was just this so much complicity in this thing</p>
<p>So if anything my takeaway was that he he shares</p>
<p>He shares the blame with a lot of other people and it&rsquo;s not it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>You know him and him only but my gosh that documentary</p>
<p>Some of the things guys are just uh, they&rsquo;re fabulous. This is this is always true in these businesses that end up with um,</p>
<p>You know bad actors that are enabled, right? I mean it&rsquo;s been the case</p>
<p>In public and public success stories and failures, right? I mean there&rsquo;s a a cult of personality</p>
<p>The personality provides the the high beta personality provides the alpha</p>
<p>And it can also it also could provide like a theranos outcome and</p>
<p>You know the thing that when you&rsquo;ll see when you watch this is I don&rsquo;t know if you guys watch the vow about that nexium cult</p>
<p>which is just</p>
<p>equally loathsome horrible people behaving badly</p>
<p>But he really targeted young people to work there and indoctrinated him into this. We&rsquo;re changing the world</p>
<p>And then there were no adults there and you see him behind the scenes when he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>At the ipo road show and he&rsquo;s having basically a panic attack and he&rsquo;s psychotic</p>
<p>I mean he was really deranged and they have this video of him trying to get through the ipo road show</p>
<p>What show is what movie is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the we work documentary documentary. Just get hulu. It&rsquo;s on hulu. Yeah, it is so deranged</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome. I mean it&rsquo;s fire festival lever deranged is a big word</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s deranged but I think it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s juicy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s gossip about his wife and like that whole thing like we school they&rsquo;re like we have to democratize</p>
<p>Education for 60 000 a year. Have you guys have you guys ever have you guys ever regretted enabling?</p>
<p>Um, you know quirky personality entrepreneurs that you&rsquo;ve backed and then you&rsquo;ve regretted it later</p>
<p>yeah, so um</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s hard to know in the midst of it</p>
<p>You know, I guess it&rsquo;s like kind of like that line like the line between genius and insanity is very thin</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, I mean the the one thing I will say is i&rsquo;ve only ever had one issue of outright fraud</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And so, you know</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean in hundreds of in hundreds of companies that i&rsquo;ve that i&rsquo;ve invested in luckily. I i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve only</p>
<p>uh, i&rsquo;ve only seen one issue where</p>
<p>You know, the ceo was extremely</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know aggressive in how they accounted for and booked revenue and you know</p>
<p>This is where one thing that we don&rsquo;t have at the early stage companies</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the check and balance of a reporting infrastructure and a third-party watchdog and all these other people and so</p>
<p>You know, you guys all know this when we go in and we sit in a meeting</p>
<p>In a board meeting and you know, the entrepreneur puts slides up. There is an inherent</p>
<p>100% categorical belief that they&rsquo;re that they aren&rsquo;t lying right? Like you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t even have to check that assumption</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just assumed that nobody&rsquo;s lying, you know good or bad</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just presenting the data and I had one case where the guy lied and it wasn&rsquo;t one was it was and our</p>
<p>Cfo and you know, our team figured it out and</p>
<p>um, you know, there were other investors and it was uh, we all were just really shocked and we had to kind of</p>
<p>Clean it up as best we could and</p>
<p>I have literally</p>
<p>a dozen, uh, and they we didn&rsquo;t wind up investing in I think 10 of the 12 and the reason is</p>
<p>We took diligence to your point chamath. Like do you how do you even know in a board meeting?</p>
<p>I just said screw it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to build a diligence team and we ask people for all their bank statements and for their itunes account and for their</p>
<p>Google analytics and if a company doesn&rsquo;t give those to us</p>
<p>We just know that something&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>And we figure it out before we invest because the two times we did get dinged on this</p>
<p>We had one where somebody was giving themselves a loan. So you did diligence we did</p>
<p>We just basically have a diligence list that says give us the incorporation docs and all these bank statements now somebody could</p>
<p>Fraudulently change a bank statement that is possible. So there it depends on how deep you want to go in the fraud</p>
<p>but did you guys ever like enable a</p>
<p>Personality that was just like so over the top and then you&rsquo;re like, oh shit</p>
<p>This is actually gonna this is actually an explosion. Like it&rsquo;s a total disaster my top three investments</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point there, that&rsquo;s a good point, right?</p>
<p>like yeah, so because okay, so I wrote about this in my blog post blitz fail about the the sort of how yeah</p>
<p>How founder psychology can actually cause a company to go off the rails</p>
<p>The the thing the thing is that</p>
<p>Founder founders do need to be much more aggressive than the average person</p>
<p>You know, we like to think that a quality that a personality trait like aggressiveness</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like some sort of normal distribution of it and you kind of want to be you know</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of the curve and it&rsquo;s actually not true</p>
<p>You want founders to be much more aggressive than the average person because if they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re just not going to persevere</p>
<p>And push hard enough right and j i mean we saw this with with uber right?</p>
<p>I mean tk was a super aggressive personality. The company would not have been as successful. How do you not push that hard? And so</p>
<p>The curve in the real world. It&rsquo;s not a normal distribution</p>
<p>It looks more like a curve where there are returns to aggressiveness and they&rsquo;re keeping increasing returns to it</p>
<p>Until suddenly the person goes too far and then they jump the shark and the whole thing craters</p>
<p>Can I say something like, you know having been in the engine room with zuck in a critical moment zuck was an aggressive guy</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Over the top and he wasn&rsquo;t just this like crazy weirdo personality. He wasn&rsquo;t enabling sexual harassment</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t doing any of that stuff. Would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was he was he was he was an intellectually incisive. He was an aggressive thinker</p>
<p>So this is why my reaction to david&rsquo;s question is I haven&rsquo;t backed assholes because I just think that that archetype doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very cool analytical personality. There are these founders that you know, we</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the term wild stallion</p>
<p>To uh to describe them where they are, you know, they&rsquo;re like these these wild stallions</p>
<p>They have tremendous upside, but they&rsquo;re also a little bit, you know, um wild and unless they sort of learn the hoof</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve got a lot of talent, right?</p>
<p>Uh the the talent is</p>
<p>The amount of talent you have is like the horse you&rsquo;re riding on and some people are riding on a bronco</p>
<p>They got a lot of talent, but it might I just think I I just think the real the real edge in investing is figuring out</p>
<p>What is bluster and window dressing and show and what is actually aggressive thinking like john and patrick collison?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero bluster with those guys</p>
<p>That company&rsquo;s gonna be zero that&rsquo;s gonna be the most valuable valuable company that&rsquo;s private right now besides</p>
<p>These guys are these guys are incredible intellectually thoughtful killers, right? That&rsquo;s what they are. That&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>They outthink everybody, but there&rsquo;s also a maturation process that a lot of founders go through, right?</p>
<p>I mean the collison&rsquo;s and zuck I think got very mature very young</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s other founders that it takes them a while to</p>
<p>Get more polished get more disciplined</p>
<p>Reign in that, you know</p>
<p>Those emotions i&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re fraudulent. We don&rsquo;t want to bet on fraudulent founders</p>
<p>But some founders need to learn how to harness the talent they have. Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that</p>
<p>And those are the ones where it&rsquo;s very hard to know earlier in their career whether to bet on them or not, right?</p>
<p>Because they may get it under control or they may not it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t tell at the beginning</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the analogy we use internally</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being professor x and the x-men you could have a jean gray or a wolverine and like everybody&rsquo;s got a different superpower</p>
<p>But you need to teach them how to use that superpower so they don&rsquo;t self-destruct or cause chaos</p>
<p>Bifurcate the other way, right? They could be magneto, right? You could you could go the other way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure I get all the references, but I hear you</p>
<p>Well, I mean i&rsquo;m kind of shocked given how much of a huge nerd you are that you don&rsquo;t understand the x-men</p>
<p>Jason, I love that movie. I love that movie with the guy who&rsquo;s made of all the rocks and the little tree guy</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s his buddy?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s guardians of the galaxy. Yes, I think I think jason&rsquo;s favorite character is the blob</p>
<p>Is that the one that&rsquo;s coming to you?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, how many how many you&rsquo;re right cubano sandwiches are you having look at your face, dude</p>
<p>How many cro no croquettes sacks?</p>
<p>Bad idea shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten there. You&rsquo;re right. Yeah</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what what is your training? Well, what&rsquo;s that? What is your health plan?</p>
<p>Are you uh now that we&rsquo;re coming out of covet? Are you running or like we got an intervention right now?</p>
<p>You look terrible</p>
<p>You do look a little bloated you look like a you look like a puffed fish. Oh, geez, I need to lose like 20 pounds</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down 12 for my peak of the covet peak. I&rsquo;m feeling good</p>
<p>Just get a personal trainer speaking of covet. What the hell is going on in india? Oh my lord. It&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>I thought the whole thing was we they were taking hydroxychloroquine for totally different reasons</p>
<p>And this is why it&rsquo;s all fine had some immunity or that it was hot</p>
<p>I mean there was a million reasons of why they were not going to get hit and then now they&rsquo;re surging</p>
<p>And we have 60 million shots on the shelf and the number of people getting shots is going down</p>
<p>This is america&rsquo;s chance to use</p>
<p>Instead of battleships and nuclear weapons. We can use this covet to shape global policy. We should be getting</p>
<p>Vaccines to other countries and be once again the shining light of the entire</p>
<p>Planet and humanity. Well, why are we not bringing shots to india now?</p>
<p>We have so many extra i&rsquo;m not sure i&rsquo;m just trying to pull up the india vax data per day. I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as much the issue, right?</p>
<p>I mean it is scary to watch their their I mean you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re our go-to science guy freeberg</p>
<p>Tell us what we&rsquo;re looking at here on this chart. I mean the daily covey cases are now hitting</p>
<p>250 000</p>
<p>300 000 a day jason right now. It broke 300. Oh my lord in the united states. It&rsquo;s gotten down to like 50 60</p>
<p>800 india has now passed the peak of the u.s</p>
<p>You know india is now seeing more cases per day than any country has seen worldwide during the whole pandemic</p>
<p>At over um, you know 300 000 a day right now</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s um, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be letting up and we&rsquo;re now questioning whether it&rsquo;s testing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the limiting factor in terms of reporting on these cases</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s pretty nasty now, there&rsquo;s a um, a famous indian politician who uh,</p>
<p>uh who had been double vaxxed, uh who claims that he is covet positive as is his um,</p>
<p>mother and sister and so it&rsquo;s also creating a little bit of a</p>
<p>concern in the market about um</p>
<p>You know getting covet now. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be having a severe case</p>
<p>um, which is you know, one of the kind of important things to take note of in vaccination is uh, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily binary</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s certainly making a lot of creating a lot of fear</p>
<p>As a result of his kind of public statement about this. This isn&rsquo;t just about cases either. Um,</p>
<p>30 days ago they were at</p>
<p>200 deaths a day and uh, I mean tragically they&rsquo;re at 2100</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 10x in 30 days if it 10x is again</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 20 000 people a day dying. This is a different level than any other country has experienced</p>
<p>Tragic and they don&rsquo;t look at the end at the end of the day</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the hospitals hospitals to handle this do they this could become a crisis of epic proportions</p>
<p>At the end of the day a country&rsquo;s success in battling covet&rsquo;s going to be about how fast they can get their population vaccinated</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple, right? I mean</p>
<p>Israel was first they got everyone vaccinated now their cases are</p>
<p>Down to almost nothing the u.s is doing pretty well. Although there&rsquo;s some room for concern we were doing</p>
<p>You know close to four million vaccinations a day now, we&rsquo;re at like three three and a half</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting to slip a little bit</p>
<p>Um, and that doesn&rsquo;t have to do with johnson and johnson, right that has to do with people not showing up for appointments</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think you got to blame the media a little bit because they keep running all these vaccine scare stories about you</p>
<p>Know how this person or that person the vaccine punched through and they got sick despite getting the vaccine</p>
<p>They keep selling they keep selling all this like, you know, covid</p>
<p>Um scary and porn, you know the the you&rsquo;re so right. Do you know what I noticed the other day on cnn?</p>
<p>this is how insincere and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Ratings desperate they are when they put up their covet stats. They put up cumulative cases and cumulative deaths</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they obsess on and it&rsquo;s like hey dummies. We know what you&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to scare people</p>
<p>You should show the graph of the debts going down</p>
<p>And then why can&rsquo;t you take your mask off if you&rsquo;re vaccinated and you&rsquo;re outside?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give a reward you were talking about this last week. Yeah, nate silver had a really good tweet about this</p>
<p>He said that wearing a mask after you&rsquo;re vaccinated is now it&rsquo;s like the the blue equivalent of the red maga hat</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s completely performative to say hey i&rsquo;m on team blue</p>
<p>You know, even though like scientifically it&rsquo;s meaningless. I it&rsquo;s like the press they keep talking about this possibility</p>
<p>That even after you&rsquo;re vaccinated and you could somehow, you know, keep transmitting the virus to other people look</p>
<p>Viruses, I mean freeberg can explain this better than me, but viruses do not</p>
<p>Have in themselves the machinery for replication, right? They have to take over your cells hijack your cells machinery to replicate themselves</p>
<p>So first they have to infect somebody then that person gets you know</p>
<p>Gets the virus starts producing a lot of it</p>
<p>Then they start shedding it if you don&rsquo;t get really sick</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be shedding a lot of the virus. You&rsquo;re not gonna be transmitting it to a lot of other people</p>
<p>And you know they talk about this this possibility</p>
<p>As if it&rsquo;s like a real possibility that people could still be transmitting the virus after they&rsquo;re vaccinated</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a statistically relevant possibility, right?</p>
<p>It comes down to this interpretation of everything being binary. And the reality is that all of this is on</p>
<p>You know a a statistical curve or on a kind of a gray scale</p>
<p>And you know the sax&rsquo;s point is 100 correct that the probability of someone who&rsquo;s been double vaccinated</p>
<p>Getting infectious getting infected and then being infectious in a meaningful way is so remote</p>
<p>Um that it is not even worth kind of considering, uh in a way and and being double vaccinated</p>
<p>Gives you such a significant typically right not for everyone, right?</p>
<p>All immune systems are different and some of what we we might be seeing is the difference in kind of how people develop immunity</p>
<p>Um, but it is such a rare case that one could have a severe infection</p>
<p>After getting a uh, you know a vaccination</p>
<p>Um is such that it it shouldn&rsquo;t even be considered and kind of you know</p>
<p>Mentioned as being a reason for continuing to wear masks and not gather and not do things</p>
<p>And so, you know, we started out as sax pointed out. I think this is such a true and important point</p>
<p>We started out with this like immediate politis</p>
<p>politicization of what&rsquo;s the right thing to do to reduce the spread of the virus and then that became the mainstay for that political affiliation</p>
<p>And now the transition of the new world that we live in where most people are vaccinated</p>
<p>We have a better understanding of the science and the statistics and the mechanisms of transmission</p>
<p>We hold on and we grasp on</p>
<p>To that initiating kind of belief system that was correct at the time</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t correct anymore</p>
<p>And it seems so difficult to get people to shift their mind this kind of um, this behavior is an ignorant behavior</p>
<p>And you see it in so many manifestations</p>
<p>Um right now in particular with respect to masks and behavior after vaccination and so on</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s really brutal to watch. Um, but we obviously digress a bit from the indian, uh circuit the indian circumstance, which is</p>
<p>A really nasty one. So it looks like why why now and not a year ago, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not clear, right?</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s um someone uh</p>
<p>provided a uh</p>
<p>Indication today that there may be as many as uh somewhere between 100 and 200 unique variants</p>
<p>That that we&rsquo;re seeing emerge in india. So there may be a</p>
<p>a lot of interesting very interesting</p>
<p>Technically, but not obviously for human life, but a lot of dramatic. Um variants or significant variants</p>
<p>That might be increasing the the infectiousness right now</p>
<p>um, and uh, and in particular</p>
<p>Uh, you know behavior has shifted in a way that&rsquo;s enabling, you know</p>
<p>Some of these transmissions to occur, you know</p>
<p>A lot of people let their guard down and so on in a way that maybe they weren&rsquo;t six months ago</p>
<p>um, and uh</p>
<p>You know, there may be some forced evolution associated with partial vaccination</p>
<p>Totally a theory right now where you know, 110 million doses have been given in india so far</p>
<p>So, you know in order for a virus to succeed the viral variants that are going to infect more likely</p>
<p>Um, you know through a partially transmit a partially vaccinated population are the ones that are winning out</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of you know, confounding factors here. We&rsquo;re not really sure</p>
<p>Um, but it is it is pretty brutal</p>
<p>Um, what is uh, what is going on?</p>
<p>Um, I will say like this notion that vaccination does not prevent</p>
<p>Uh protection against variants is not a binary statement either. This is really really important</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to say this for a couple of our shows</p>
<p>When you get this vaccine</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re training yourselves. You&rsquo;re giving yourselves the RNA to print the spike protein and that protein is now in your body</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s immune system then reacts differently to create antibodies to that protein</p>
<p>The antibodies that chamath makes and jason makes and sax makes and I make are all going to be different</p>
<p>But if you had to pick whose would be better</p>
<p>I can tell you sax is probably going to be the worst off but yeah, jason&rsquo;s are the most sluggish for sure</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the slowest. Yeah, but but there there are likely tens of thousands of novel variants that our b cells will make that will</p>
<p>That will bind to that spike protein and get rid of it and we will each have many hundreds or potentially thousands of novel</p>
<p>Antibodies that our immune system will make so keep that in mind</p>
<p>You now have a portfolio of antibodies that your body is producing to that spike protein</p>
<p>So now when when a when a covid when a sars-cov-2 virus shows up in your body</p>
<p>Some of those proteins some of those antibodies are going to be really effective at getting rid of it</p>
<p>Some of them are not</p>
<p>Now the protein in the sars-cov-2 virus changes slightly</p>
<p>Some of the other antibodies you have are going to be effective and some of the other ones are not</p>
<p>And it is that portfolio that is um</p>
<p>That is going to change</p>
<p>Sorry that that portfolio that is going to define</p>
<p>Your success at fighting off a specific variant of sars-cov-2</p>
<p>Where the spike protein is changing slightly with each variant, right?</p>
<p>So these variants change the composition of the protein the antibodies that you have are going to be</p>
<p>You know more or less successful depending on how that variant changes and that&rsquo;s um where there may be cases</p>
<p>Where the number of antibodies that you are producing or the success of the antibodies that you particularly have</p>
<p>Are a little bit lower for a particularly new variant</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re going to have an infection that&rsquo;s going to be a runaway infection in your body</p>
<p>It means that it might take you longer</p>
<p>Or it might be a little bit harder for you to clear that particular variant given the repertoire of antibodies that you&rsquo;ve produced</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why this isn&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s why this isn&rsquo;t binary, right?</p>
<p>It could be that it&rsquo;s like hey this variant shows up boom instantly. I got rid of it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any infection, but someone else might have like, you know, maybe a slight bit of um, uh,</p>
<p>You know, there might be a couple days where they&rsquo;ll feel a cold as your body&rsquo;s clearing it out</p>
<p>And the measure of this is this um this neutralizing titer</p>
<p>Which is the where they take people&rsquo;s blood with all of their antibodies in it</p>
<p>And they put these different variants in and they can measure how effective your antibodies are getting rid of that new variant</p>
<p>and the less effective your antibodies are</p>
<p>The higher this this this titer needs to be</p>
<p>And as a result it could be a little bit longer a little bit harder for you to get rid of that that virus</p>
<p>And so so again like when viral variants start to emerge in the population and as they kind of take off</p>
<p>And become more dominant. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we don&rsquo;t have immunity. It means that immunity might be slightly affected</p>
<p>But not not it&rsquo;s not one or zero, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got hundreds or thousands of antibodies to fight against covid</p>
<p>In your body, and I think that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>So we should you know, while there may be some variants that might be what we call variants of concern</p>
<p>Meaning they can kind of slip away a little bit from most of the antibodies you have</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not going to be able to fight them off with the antibodies</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if that was too technical or too difficult to understand, but I think it&rsquo;s really it makes total sense</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>yeah, and and and one thing just to add to that is is that most of the variants that the press keeps</p>
<p>Reporting with alarm that are somehow that that basically are going to be vaccine proof. They turn out not to be</p>
<p>you know that we they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very shortly, uh</p>
<p>There there comes out a new article basically saying that the vaccines work</p>
<p>And so the press keeps reporting these isolated cases as proof of something. That&rsquo;s not actually true</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean this is I just want to give the press</p>
<p>Um a kind of I just want to again accounting for the press in the last 30 days one</p>
<p>obsessing about every single shooting</p>
<p>And then inspiring more shootings when you obsess about these mass shootings you inspire more of them</p>
<p>It is a proven fact. It is inducing people to do this more. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>exactly</p>
<p>Correlated but there is proof about this same thing with suicides</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t cover any young people killing themselves in the bay area in a certain</p>
<p>Town that we all know had a rash of them or we don&rsquo;t cover</p>
<p>Suicides on the golden gate bridge anymore because when they used to cover them and put it on the cover of the chronicle</p>
<p>Two more people would jump off the next week number two. They were obsessing about riots</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you turned on the tv during the deliberations. They were</p>
<p>absolutely gleeful</p>
<p>about the potential</p>
<p>of trouble happening and that of course incense more people to go out and see what&rsquo;s going on because you&rsquo;re going to get on tv</p>
<p>And because other people are doing it and humans model other humans and then finally with the goddamn johnson and johnson</p>
<p>Eight people have blood cuts. Nobody died. Am I correct in that?</p>
<p>And the one person died one person died, okay, so we don&rsquo;t even know and then they obsess about that for days like</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t cover these things wall to wall and not</p>
<p>Think that they you don&rsquo;t have culpability the cnn&rsquo;s the foxes, etc</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obsessing over these things and it&rsquo;s scaring people to not take vaccines</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incenting people who are crazy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dog whistling crazy people to go get a gun and to use that as a way to get famous and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the same thing, you know with the with these. Um</p>
<p>You know riots in the streets. We&rsquo;re all in the opinion business. Um,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s but but the problem is when they just when they don&rsquo;t just hype things</p>
<p>but they actually give you factually incorrect information because</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re trying to scare people into getting higher ratings, you know, fear porn</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also framing david which is a different thing than lying about statistics. They would say we&rsquo;re not lying about the statistics</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how many people died of covet</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re framing the cumulative number to make you scared today</p>
<p>400 000 people have died from covet. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>No over 14 months 400 people died of covet 700 people died today</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the lowest number since november, but that wouldn&rsquo;t get more people to tune in boys</p>
<p>I want to tell you guys something. It&rsquo;s frustrating. Yeah</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m vaccinated</p>
<p>Um, I want to I want to see you</p>
<p>I want to hug you keep your shirt on and it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s 5 30 p.m</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;ve been uh working since 5 00 a.m. This morning. Oh, is that what that look is exhaustion exhausted?</p>
<p>I came back from easter vacation guys, and I had been up between either at 5 00 a.m. Or 6 00 a.m</p>
<p>Every fucking you&rsquo;re working hard. You&rsquo;re working hard. I am grinding but I am tired</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s wrap here when we as we wrap what what&rsquo;s going on just because people have been asking</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with the scc and spax and and just some more reporting or something because I was watching cnbc and they said</p>
<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re doing everything right, but there&rsquo;s a lot of other people who are doing things wrong explain to us what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I mean, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very specific. Um accounting issue, which is that</p>
<p>Some spax many spax and in fact many companies let&rsquo;s just put it that way not just spax, but many companies use warrants</p>
<p>and the prevailing guidance on certain warrants was that they were equity and</p>
<p>Basically that gets put into a balance sheet statement where you have equities assets and liabilities and you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s on one side</p>
<p>And uh, basically what they said was they issued some refined guidance that said actually in these specific cases</p>
<p>these should be really listed as liabilities, so then it needs to move from this column to that column, but</p>
<p>when that when you do that you go through, you know, a bunch of cascading implications and effects and</p>
<p>you know revisions and restatements and so that&rsquo;s what the that&rsquo;s what the entire securities industry is dealing with right now, which was</p>
<p>Um, you know this guidance by the scc and the implication so that was on the 12th</p>
<p>I mean just so you know today we just filed the updated</p>
<p>All of our updated docs plus the updated s4 for sofi</p>
<p>so we were able to work around the clock and just kind of get it done and hopefully what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also done is create a</p>
<p>a bit of a way forward and a path that other folks can use to kind of like accelerate their their progress, but</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely created. Um</p>
<p>a ton of work, um</p>
<p>But uh, but we&rsquo;re I think we&rsquo;re I think we found the right answer</p>
<p>Ultimately good for you because you want to see it be buttoned up, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and and also I think like the simpler path forward</p>
<p>so, I mean if you just think about capital market stability for a moment like</p>
<p>Warrant coverage should probably go away number one, right? So take all the warrants to zero</p>
<p>second thing that should happen is that uh, you know</p>
<p>I think this is an opportunity to take a step back and figure out how to really</p>
<p>Make sure that the SPAC sponsors are of the highest quality. Somebody told me this incredible thing today</p>
<p>I am one of five groups that put up any money when we do a pipe in our deals</p>
<p>Meaning he said to me 95 of sponsors put up literally a zero in the game</p>
<p>Zero, and so of course you&rsquo;re going to have you know, extremely loose underwriting requirements if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>And so, you know the idea that i&rsquo;m thinking about</p>
<p>Uh, which someone proposed to me which I think is very clever is this idea that you know, you earn more of the promote</p>
<p>Uh more money you put up, right? So for example, like, you know, um, you know in so far</p>
<p>I think we put in 275 million dollars</p>
<p>um, so I mean we really you know, um, that&rsquo;s a meaningful commitment and</p>
<p>It closes the gap between you know</p>
<p>What your equity is issued at and what investors are buying at and that&rsquo;s very healthy, right?</p>
<p>and so I think there&rsquo;s all these mechanisms that will</p>
<p>Clean up the SPAC market. We need to have a much</p>
<p>More refined</p>
<p>Criteria to allow people to be sponsors</p>
<p>And we need to make sponsors in a position where they must put in money</p>
<p>So that they actually do the work if you get something for free</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. You won&rsquo;t do the work if you&rsquo;re forced to write a check</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hundred percent about it show me an incentive. I&rsquo;ll show you the outcome and this happened on angel list</p>
<p>Where in the beginning days of angel list you had some angels quote-unquote who didn&rsquo;t have any money</p>
<p>So they put a thousand or two thousand into a deal</p>
<p>Then they would have five hundred thousand come behind them</p>
<p>And so you had this five hundred to one ratio of dollars to skin in the game and it was like well, why wouldn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>A syndicate lead put every company out there and not even put it, you know, they have no skin</p>
<p>Which is why when you have a venture fund, I don&rsquo;t know what they expect us to put in typically</p>
<p>Well, the problem is venture funds are one to two percent. I was 25</p>
<p>Well one to two percent is it could be pretty significant if you&rsquo;re doing a fund every three years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this and it&rsquo;s it winds up being millions of dollars for me</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;m happy to do it because I believe in my own ability</p>
<p>All right, as we wrap anybody have a plug or anything?</p>
<p>They want to let people know about oh, I I want to talk about this one little thing</p>
<p>I just uh not to talk about it, but I would like to tell you guys to read it because it is so interesting</p>
<p>Basically like european soccer tried to incite a revolt where like the top teams across all the different leagues</p>
<p>Came together to try to create a super league</p>
<p>but it ended up like they were like a band of evil villains and like</p>
<p>Fans erupted everybody erupted and then you know, it existed for 24 hours</p>
<p>But in that 24 hours, it looked like a complete rewriting of sports and sports</p>
<p>Like uh laws and you know, um, it was an incredible thing. There&rsquo;s an article in the new york times i&rsquo;ll post it in here and</p>
<p>Folks want to read it. It&rsquo;s really really fucking funny and that will be on season two of ted lasso</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys watched tim cook&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Um keynote this week with the new imax, which are really beautiful. Um</p>
<p>He was so excited about ted lasso and ted lasso is a great show</p>
<p>But I mean it literally is the the apple, uh show did anybody you guys see ted lasso yet?</p>
<p>What is it this television show you guys haven&rsquo;t seen ted lasso the tv show yet?</p>
<p>Is it on mbc or cbs?</p>
<p>What channel is it on tv plus whatever that is channel six?</p>
<p>Is it on channel six tv plus you gotta go on your apple tv and then find an apple tv plus on your tv</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll find it eventually. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of their paid, you know, they have their own netflix competitor called apple tv plus</p>
<p>So on your phone if you type apple tv, you&rsquo;ll have apple tv</p>
<p>I have apple tvs. I have apple tvs behind my tv. No, no, but there&rsquo;s apple tv plus which is their netflix</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a better. Is it a better apple tv? No, no, no, it&rsquo;s content. It&rsquo;s a content subscription you could have</p>
<p>They just they screwed that part up. Um, hey shout out. Um, I just wanted to get uh, sorry</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s ted lasso ted lasso is a jason sudeikis</p>
<p>Comedy that is incredibly heartwarming</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>A really heartwarming joyful kind person who goes from america to the uk</p>
<p>To become a soccer coach</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really great. Yeah, I hate that&rsquo;s boring. That sounds really kind you would hate it david. It&rsquo;s not cynical. I do. I hate it</p>
<p>You should watch you should watch you should watch gamora on hbo. I started it. Yeah, woof</p>
<p>On italian. Yeah, I got to the first episode. I was like, whoa, here we go</p>
<p>It is so super and also you should watch it in the original language because it&rsquo;s not really italian</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like neapolitan and so like</p>
<p>You know, I can catch and understand maybe 20 of the words and I said to nat I said</p>
<p>What language is she&rsquo;s like? I had no idea. I watched it in italian subtitles. So it was it was beautiful. It&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>Beautiful. It&rsquo;s so intense. It&rsquo;s like the wire but like I mean, you know set in italy. It&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>Uh afterlife is also good ricky gervais if you want something cynical and heartwarming that&rsquo;s for you sax</p>
<p>Love you guys. Love you sax. I&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>Can you please come back to the bay area so we can play poker? Yeah</p>
<p>When he just why don&rsquo;t you just why don&rsquo;t we go to um, miami? Are we going to miami? I&rsquo;m going. Oh, yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going on a trip. I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that. I&rsquo;ll talk to you guys</p>
<p>Recognizance trip</p>
<p>Recognizance yeah recognizance</p>
<p>Understand what&rsquo;s going on. Do you understand that that term is more associated with bail and in jail than it is what you think it means</p>
<p>Jason you are released on your own recognizance. That&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m talking about. You want to do reconnaissance reconnaissance? That&rsquo;s what I said</p>
<p>reconnaissance</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;ll be wearing an ankle bracelet on your recognizance</p>
<p>Actually, no, they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t fit on his ankles</p>
<p>One word to make it a good episode for jason, it&rsquo;ll be a cankle bracelet</p>
<p>Mr. Doughboy, what are you talking about? My god? What do you is it called a bracelet if your calf and your ankle are the same?</p>
<p>Put this way if sax sax is wearing two of them right now, you&rsquo;d never know</p>
<p>Sax is wearing one on his neck. What happened to your neck sax?</p>
<p>Sax is wearing one on his neck. What happened to your neck sax? We&rsquo;re out. We&rsquo;re out. Where&rsquo;s your neck joppa?</p>
<p>Love you besties. Bye. Bye. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride</p>
<p>Rain man david sax</p>
<p>And instead we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it love us queen of</p>
<p>What what your winners ride</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release somehow</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be what you&rsquo;re your feet</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be what we need to get mercies are</p>
