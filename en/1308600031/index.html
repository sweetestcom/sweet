    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation</p>
<p>or how we sense things.</p>
<p>On previous episodes,</p>
<p>we talked about sensing light and sound waves</p>
<p>for things like vision and hearing.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s called interoception.</p>
<p>Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape,</p>
<p>things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut,</p>
<p>how full our gut might happen to be</p>
<p>or how empty our gut might happen to be,</p>
<p>but also our inner landscape with respect to chemistry,</p>
<p>how acidic or how good or bad we feel on the inside.</p>
<p>This discussion about sense of self and interoception</p>
<p>has many important actionable items</p>
<p>that relate to bodily health and brain health,</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>our ability to perform well or perform poorly in life.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has profound influence on our rates of healing.</p>
<p>So today, we are going to talk about</p>
<p>all the aspects of our inner landscape</p>
<p>and how our brain and body communicate,</p>
<p>and there will be many actionable protocols</p>
<p>as we go along that discussion.</p>
<p>Before we begin our discussion about sense of self,</p>
<p>I want to highlight</p>
<p>some very recently published research findings</p>
<p>that I believe are immediately actionable</p>
<p>and that everybody should be aware of.</p>
<p>These are data that were published</p>
<p>by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine,</p>
<p>and the data were published in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is a very, very high stringency cell press journal.</p>
<p>So phenomenal data.</p>
<p>What this study showed was that</p>
<p>individuals given a high fiber diet</p>
<p>actually experienced less diversity</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The number of positive or health-promoting bacteria</p>
<p>in the gut was actually reduced by a high fiber diet,</p>
<p>whereas individuals that ate just a couple of servings</p>
<p>of fermented food each day</p>
<p>experienced important and beneficial increases</p>
<p>in anti-inflammatory markers,</p>
<p>and that could be traced back to improvements</p>
<p>in the gut microbiome diversity.</p>
<p>The diversity of bugs, literally,</p>
<p>little bacteria that live in the gut,</p>
<p>which might sound bad,</p>
<p>but they are actually very health-promoting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get into all the details of this study</p>
<p>later in the episode,</p>
<p>but I just wanted to emphasize these findings</p>
<p>because they are immediately actionable.</p>
<p>I think for most people,</p>
<p>ingesting one or two servings of fermented food each day</p>
<p>is reasonable and does not bring with it tremendous costs</p>
<p>or tremendous inconvenience,</p>
<p>and I think many people are ingesting high fiber diets</p>
<p>thinking that that&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to improve their gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So while these data may prove to be controversial</p>
<p>among the folks out there in the nutrition community</p>
<p>that really promote high fiber diet,</p>
<p>I want to just emphasize that these data</p>
<p>were looked at in a very unbiased way.</p>
<p>They were done with large-scale screens</p>
<p>of all sorts of inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>There was no specific hypothesis going in.</p>
<p>It was purely exploratory,</p>
<p>but the data are very, very clear.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t eat fiber.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that fiber is bad,</p>
<p>but it really shows that eating fermented foods,</p>
<p>just one or two servings a day,</p>
<p>and maybe even ramping up to three or four servings per day</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for many aspects of health.</p>
<p>Before we go any further,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who cares about your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested in performance</p>
<p>of any kind, in work, in relationships, et cetera,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s topic, I believe,</p>
<p>is among the more important ones for you.</p>
<p>Of all the topics I could cover,</p>
<p>this thing that we call sense of self,</p>
<p>which is also called interoception,</p>
<p>has perhaps the most foundational level of importance</p>
<p>for all that we feel, all that we do,</p>
<p>and all that we are capable of doing.</p>
<p>In fact, I will go so far as to say that interoception,</p>
<p>or our ability to sense our inner real estate,</p>
<p>is right there next to sleep,</p>
<p>and perhaps one other feature of our health</p>
<p>and bodily function that primarily determine</p>
<p>how good we feel in the now, in the short-term,</p>
<p>and in the long-term,</p>
<p>and sets the stage for everything we are capable of doing.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t take care of this thing</p>
<p>that we call interoception,</p>
<p>just like if we don&rsquo;t take care of sleep,</p>
<p>we cannot perform well, and we will not remain healthy.</p>
<p>Interoception and sense of self</p>
<p>are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>I will use those terms interchangeably,</p>
<p>at least for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>And I promise that if you can learn a little bit</p>
<p>about the mechanisms of self-sensing,</p>
<p>of understanding what&rsquo;s going on in your internal milieu,</p>
<p>as we say, your internal environment,</p>
<p>you will position yourself to do some very simple things</p>
<p>that can lead to outsized positive effects on everything,</p>
<p>from sleep, to body composition, to mental focus,</p>
<p>to mood, your ability to regulate stress,</p>
<p>and indeed, even your ability to heal and recovery</p>
<p>from injuries of different kinds,</p>
<p>brain injury and bodily injury.</p>
<p>So sense of self is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes called our sixth sense,</p>
<p>right alongside the other five senses,</p>
<p>like hearing, vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera.</p>
<p>But sense of self is different.</p>
<p>Sense of self is really about what&rsquo;s going on internally</p>
<p>within the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>And it involves two key features</p>
<p>that if you can understand those features</p>
<p>and you understand what modulates</p>
<p>or changes our ability to sense those features,</p>
<p>there are a lot of things that you can do</p>
<p>in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices,</p>
<p>how you relate to your exercise practices,</p>
<p>perhaps even certain things that you take</p>
<p>in terms of supplementation</p>
<p>that can basically make you feel better,</p>
<p>more alert, and more capable for everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a hyperbolic statement.</p>
<p>In fact, I know it&rsquo;s not a hyperbolic statement</p>
<p>because we have a system in our body</p>
<p>that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs</p>
<p>and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain.</p>
<p>And that communication between brain and body</p>
<p>in both directions creates a situation</p>
<p>where either we are positioned to do things well</p>
<p>or we are positioned to do things poorly.</p>
<p>So I really want to dive in and dissect</p>
<p>what is this system of brain-body communication?</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>What are the actual neurons and connections?</p>
<p>And as I do that,</p>
<p>I promise that I&rsquo;m going to place protocols,</p>
<p>tools that you can apply</p>
<p>in order to make sure that those neurons and connections</p>
<p>are working optimally.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin by talking about what system</p>
<p>communicates the brain to the body</p>
<p>and the body back to the brain.</p>
<p>The system that&rsquo;s most often associated with this</p>
<p>is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The word vagus relates to the word vagabond,</p>
<p>which is to wander.</p>
<p>And indeed, the vagus nerve is a vast,</p>
<p>enormous, wandering set of nerves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not one nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like one fiber, one axon, as we say.</p>
<p>In the nervous system, we have these wires we call axons</p>
<p>that let neurons communicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of neurons</p>
<p>and a bunch of wires that go everywhere.</p>
<p>So where do they go?</p>
<p>Well, they leave the brain and the brainstem.</p>
<p>The brainstem is kind of the back of your brain.</p>
<p>If you touch the back of your neck,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about three inches deep to where you&rsquo;re touching.</p>
<p>The neurons that are there send information into the body</p>
<p>to control your bodily organs.</p>
<p>How fast your heart is beating,</p>
<p>how fast you&rsquo;re breathing,</p>
<p>how fast your digestion is occurring.</p>
<p>Even things like whether or not you are going to secrete</p>
<p>so-called killer cells, your immune cells,</p>
<p>from your spleen to go ward off bacteria.</p>
<p>Now, the neurons there don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>unless they receive information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on within the body.</p>
<p>And within the body, your heart, your lungs,</p>
<p>your diaphragm, your gut,</p>
<p>so everything from your intestines to your stomach, et cetera</p>
<p>and your spleen are sending information</p>
<p>also up to the brain.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, it&rsquo;s a two-way street.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve,</p>
<p>but just by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular.</p>
<p>It sounds like one thing,</p>
<p>but actually what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is a series of super highways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Google Maps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got stuff going everywhere with alternate routes,</p>
<p>communicating back and forth.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental features</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in your body</p>
<p>that need to be communicated to your brain,</p>
<p>these neurons in your brainstem,</p>
<p>in order for your brain and your body</p>
<p>to work together correctly.</p>
<p>And the two types of information are mechanical information,</p>
<p>so things like pressure, things like lack of pressure</p>
<p>and chemical information,</p>
<p>whether or not your gut is acidic</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s not acidic,</p>
<p>whether or not you have some sort of pathogen,</p>
<p>something that you ate or that got into your body somehow</p>
<p>and is making you sick</p>
<p>or whether or not you don&rsquo;t have a pathogen in your body.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing.</p>
<p>So when you think about your sense of self</p>
<p>and your ability to understand what&rsquo;s going on in your body,</p>
<p>if you feel good or if you feel bad,</p>
<p>your sense of self is dependent on these mechanical</p>
<p>phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.</p>
<p>And for every organ in your body,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s your heart or your lungs</p>
<p>or your spleen,</p>
<p>both the mechanical information about that organ,</p>
<p>for instance, is if your gut is full or empty,</p>
<p>whether or not your heart is beating fast</p>
<p>or beating slowly, that&rsquo;s mechanical.</p>
<p>And chemical information,</p>
<p>whether or not your gut feels nice</p>
<p>and whether, you know, when I say nice,</p>
<p>I mean, whether or not it has a balance of acidity</p>
<p>and alkalinity that feels right to you</p>
<p>or whether or not your gut feels off,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, that&rsquo;s chemical information.</p>
<p>If you are not getting enough oxygen</p>
<p>and levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high,</p>
<p>so your lungs can register that</p>
<p>and that chemical information is sent to your brain</p>
<p>and then your brain does certain things.</p>
<p>Actually, it really encourages you to do certain things</p>
<p>in order to adjust that chemistry.</p>
<p>So the first principle that everyone should understand</p>
<p>about their sense of self is that they are sensing</p>
<p>mechanical and chemical information</p>
<p>about every organ in their body,</p>
<p>except for one, and that&rsquo;s the brain.</p>
<p>Your brain actually doesn&rsquo;t have pain receptors.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have touch receptors.</p>
<p>The brain is a command center.</p>
<p>It helps drive and govern changes</p>
<p>in the organs of the body,</p>
<p>but your brain doesn&rsquo;t move, at least not much.</p>
<p>It can move a little bit.</p>
<p>Fluid moves within it, but as long as you&rsquo;re healthy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not moving that much.</p>
<p>Your brain has no sensation of its own.</p>
<p>In fact, when they do brain surgery on people,</p>
<p>they will anesthetize or put some anesthesia on the scalp.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll cut away the skin there</p>
<p>so that people don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll use some anesthesia.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll peel back the skin,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll use a, well, let&rsquo;s call it what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bone saw, and they basically saw open</p>
<p>a little window in the skull.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually done this before and seen this before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this many times before.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;re inside the brain,</p>
<p>you can put electrodes in there,</p>
<p>and you can put various things in there,</p>
<p>of course, all for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>And you do that without any anesthesia</p>
<p>to the actual brain tissue,</p>
<p>because it has no receptors to sense anything.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have pain receptors.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have pressure receptors, none of that.</p>
<p>When you have a headache and your head feels</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s too much pressure,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s because of receptors that lie outside the brain.</p>
<p>So your organs are different.</p>
<p>They need to tell your brain what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And there are ways that you can control the mechanical</p>
<p>and the chemical state of your organs</p>
<p>in ways that are very powerful.</p>
<p>And this is crucial to do</p>
<p>because if you can properly regulate the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical environment of your body,</p>
<p>your brain functions better.</p>
<p>This is absolutely clear from data</p>
<p>that if your gut is healthy,</p>
<p>if you get the alkalinity right, the acidity right,</p>
<p>and if your spleen is healthy and happy,</p>
<p>and if your lungs are working properly,</p>
<p>not just breathing and pumping in and out air,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re breathing at the right cadence</p>
<p>for a particular activity,</p>
<p>then your brain will function better.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about how you can adjust the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical environment of your organs</p>
<p>in order to make your brain better</p>
<p>and how your brain can make the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical environment within your organs function better.</p>
<p>For instance, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how you can change the chemistry of your gut</p>
<p>in order for your brain to be able to focus better,</p>
<p>think better, remember better, and sleep better.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about how you can change</p>
<p>the chemistry of other organs in your body</p>
<p>such that your immune system will function better</p>
<p>than it would otherwise.</p>
<p>And you can actually heal faster</p>
<p>from small cuts and bruises,</p>
<p>but also injuries of any kind, even major injuries.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, we&rsquo;ve got these organs,</p>
<p>the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain what that is,</p>
<p>the gut and the spleen, and the spleen is this immune organ.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take one example of these</p>
<p>and explain how mechanical and chemical information</p>
<p>from this particular set of organs</p>
<p>communicates to the brain</p>
<p>and how that changes how our brain works.</p>
<p>And the organ I&rsquo;d like to focus on first</p>
<p>are the lungs and the diaphragm.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all familiar with our lungs,</p>
<p>these two big bags of air,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually not two big bags of air.</p>
<p>They actually have little tiny sacs within them,</p>
<p>actually millions of little sacs</p>
<p>called the alveoli of the lungs.</p>
<p>The alveoli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons</p>
<p>throughout our lungs.</p>
<p>And the more of those balloons we have,</p>
<p>the more air that we can actually contain.</p>
<p>So we are not two big bags of air in there, our lungs.</p>
<p>We actually have millions and millions</p>
<p>of little tiny bags of air within those lungs.</p>
<p>Those little bags of air can fill up or they can deflate,</p>
<p>right, just like your lungs overall can fill up</p>
<p>or they can deflate.</p>
<p>The diaphragm is a muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of shaped like a dome.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a, you know,</p>
<p>think about a basketball or a soccer ball</p>
<p>that has most of the air pushed out of it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of crescent shape or dome shaped,</p>
<p>and it sits below our lungs.</p>
<p>And the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together</p>
<p>is very interesting.</p>
<p>The diaphragm is actually skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like a bicep or a quadricep.</p>
<p>And the fact that it is skeletal muscle is important</p>
<p>because it has a unique property,</p>
<p>which is that you can control it voluntarily.</p>
<p>You can decide to take control of your diaphragm</p>
<p>by just consciously deciding you want to breathe</p>
<p>in a particular way.</p>
<p>Just like you can take conscious control over your legs.</p>
<p>They will work just fine if you&rsquo;re not thinking about them</p>
<p>as you walk, provided you already know how to walk.</p>
<p>But at any moment,</p>
<p>you can decide to change the rate of your walking,</p>
<p>your so-called cadence of walking.</p>
<p>So the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle</p>
<p>also has that property.</p>
<p>The diaphragm moves up and down</p>
<p>depending on how you breathe,</p>
<p>or rather I should say,</p>
<p>how the diaphragm moves up and down</p>
<p>determines how you breathe.</p>
<p>How you breathe is also dependent on little muscles</p>
<p>that are between your ribs,</p>
<p>the intercostals and other muscles.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a martial arts fan,</p>
<p>Bruce Lee was famous for having these</p>
<p>very pronounced intercostals</p>
<p>from doing all sorts of bridging exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>But those are the muscles.</p>
<p>And we all have them even if some of us,</p>
<p>most of us don&rsquo;t have intercostals like Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>So when you breathe, a couple of things happen,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about the mechanical things first.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s talk about how those mechanical steps</p>
<p>relate back to the brain</p>
<p>and what that does for the brain.</p>
<p>And I can promise you that if you develop an awareness</p>
<p>of these mechanical changes,</p>
<p>you do not have to go through extensive breathwork practice</p>
<p>or do extensive breathwork.</p>
<p>You will immediately, believe it or not,</p>
<p>develop a sense of your breathing self,</p>
<p>of your lungs and diaphragm.</p>
<p>It takes no practice, but once you do it,</p>
<p>you will forever be changed</p>
<p>in terms of your awareness of your breathing</p>
<p>and your ability to leverage your breathing,</p>
<p>kind of like the steering wheel on a car</p>
<p>in order to shift your brain</p>
<p>in the direction that you want to go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very powerful system.</p>
<p>And the way it works is the following,</p>
<p>and this will also incorporate the heart.</p>
<p>So, and by the heart, I don&rsquo;t mean it in the emotional sense,</p>
<p>although we don&rsquo;t rule out emotions</p>
<p>here at the Huberman Lab Podcast, we like emotions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking about the heart as an organ,</p>
<p>as a beating organ that circulates blood.</p>
<p>So when we inhale,</p>
<p>these little sacs in our lungs fill up</p>
<p>and our lungs expand.</p>
<p>And when we do that,</p>
<p>we take up space in our thoracic cavity</p>
<p>and our diaphragm moves down, okay?</p>
<p>When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,</p>
<p>the lungs get smaller, okay?</p>
<p>So inhales, diaphragm moves down,</p>
<p>exhales, diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>This actually controls our heart rate,</p>
<p>but it does it by changing the way that our brain works.</p>
<p>And it works in the following way.</p>
<p>So when we inhale, our lungs fill,</p>
<p>our diaphragm moves down,</p>
<p>our heart actually has a little more space</p>
<p>because the diaphragms move down.</p>
<p>So the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger,</p>
<p>not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>whatever blood is in the heart flows at a slower rate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a larger volume.</p>
<p>So bigger volume heart,</p>
<p>same amount of blood inside the heart means slower flow.</p>
<p>Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe.</p>
<p>The brain registers that</p>
<p>because there are a set of neurons on the heart</p>
<p>called the sinoatrial node.</p>
<p>It sends that information to the brain.</p>
<p>That information is registered by the brain</p>
<p>and the brain sends a message back to the heart</p>
<p>to speed the heart up.</p>
<p>So every time you inhale,</p>
<p>because of these mechanical changes</p>
<p>in the diaphragm and lungs,</p>
<p>and because of the mechanical changes in the heart,</p>
<p>your brain sends a signal to the heart</p>
<p>to speed the heart up.</p>
<p>So if you do long inhales or you inhale more vigorously,</p>
<p>you actually are speeding your heart up.</p>
<p>Now, of course you have to exhale as well.</p>
<p>But for instance, if I were to inhale very long,</p>
<p>like the entire time my heart rate is increasing.</p>
<p>And then if I did a quick exhale,</p>
<p>something else will happen.</p>
<p>But if I kept doing that,</p>
<p>my heart rate would increase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to increase linearly and forever,</p>
<p>but it will increase with each inhale.</p>
<p>Or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous</p>
<p>and my heart rate will speed up.</p>
<p>This is an autonomic and automatic relationship</p>
<p>between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart.</p>
<p>Now, if inhales speed the heart up,</p>
<p>what happens on exhales?</p>
<p>When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but you can kind of think about it</p>
<p>as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right?</p>
<p>When you exhale, this thing moves up.</p>
<p>And as the diaphragm moves up,</p>
<p>the heart has less space,</p>
<p>meaning it gets a little bit smaller,</p>
<p>which means that whatever volume of blood</p>
<p>is inside the heart moves faster</p>
<p>through that smaller volume.</p>
<p>That information is sent to the brain</p>
<p>via these collection of neurons</p>
<p>called the sinoatrial node, for you aficionados.</p>
<p>The brain then sends information via the vagus nerve</p>
<p>back to the heart to slow the heart down.</p>
<p>So while inhales speed up the heart, that&rsquo;s the net effect,</p>
<p>exhales slow the heart down.</p>
<p>And the reason they slow the heart down</p>
<p>is because of a register in the change,</p>
<p>a mechanical pressure between the diaphragm,</p>
<p>the lungs and the heart.</p>
<p>So this is to me,</p>
<p>the simplest and most straightforward example</p>
<p>of how the brain is changing the way our organs work,</p>
<p>our heart in this case,</p>
<p>according to changes in mechanical interoception.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re not always aware of this.</p>
<p>Some of us are aware of it, some of us aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you do it right now, you will be aware of it.</p>
<p>So if you can try this, you can basically,</p>
<p>this is an experiment or an example in interoception,</p>
<p>in sensing one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>So if you inhale, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long you inhale,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>And then exhale twice as long.</p>
<p>Nose or mouth, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The entire time that you&rsquo;re exhaling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re slowing your heart down.</p>
<p>So just as a car has an accelerator and a brake,</p>
<p>or you can slow a car by coming off the accelerator.</p>
<p>When you exhale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re effectively coming off the accelerator,</p>
<p>or if you want to think about it differently,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hitting the brake,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re slowing down your heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, normally your heart rate stays in more or less</p>
<p>the same range for a given activity,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re inhaling and exhaling.</p>
<p>But this is just a simple way of showing</p>
<p>that mechanical changes in your viscera</p>
<p>can change the way that your brain works,</p>
<p>and then your brain changes the way that those viscera work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very concrete agreement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a contract between the organs of your body</p>
<p>and the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, you can think about this contract in more detail,</p>
<p>and you can leverage this in a very powerful way</p>
<p>to set the conditions of your mind.</p>
<p>If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales.</p>
<p>And the simplest way to do this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this many times before,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t heard me say it,</p>
<p>this will become immediately clear,</p>
<p>is to emphasize exhales through</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a physiological sigh.</p>
<p>Two inhales, could be through the nose or the mouth,</p>
<p>but ideally through the nose.</p>
<p>So, followed by a long exhale.</p>
<p>Those double inhales are kind of important</p>
<p>because what they do is they maximally fill</p>
<p>all those little sacks in your lungs.</p>
<p>And then when you breathe out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exhaling as much of the so-called carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in your system as possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about carbon dioxide in a second.</p>
<p>So, the fastest way to calm down is to emphasize exhales.</p>
<p>When you make exhales longer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re slowing your heart rate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re calming down.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need any sophisticated training.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do this for minutes on end.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to call it breath work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just respiration.</p>
<p>And in fact, you do this every night when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>or if you hold your breath or something,</p>
<p>or you watch an animal or a small child that&rsquo;s sleeping,</p>
<p>they will occasionally do these double inhale long exhales.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of slowing the heart down</p>
<p>and eliminating carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true.</p>
<p>If you inhale deeply or vigorously,</p>
<p>and then exhale less long or less vigorously,</p>
<p>you will increase your level of alertness</p>
<p>through these purely mechanical aspects</p>
<p>of your interoception.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I were to take a big, deep inhale,</p>
<p>and then a short exhale,</p>
<p>and then another one, big inhale, short exhale,</p>
<p>it only takes two or three of those</p>
<p>before you start to feel more alert.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because your heart rate is increasing.</p>
<p>And actually, if you keep doing that for 25 or 30 breaths</p>
<p>of inhale deep, short exhale,</p>
<p>you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline,</p>
<p>this hormone that comes from your kidneys</p>
<p>and from your brainstem,</p>
<p>make you feel really alert.</p>
<p>You will actually feel as if you&rsquo;ve had a couple of espresso</p>
<p>you will immediately wake up.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an intermediate form of breathing,</p>
<p>which is sometimes called box breathing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really equal inhale and exhale duration.</p>
<p>And these, it basically goes like this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to inhale.</p>
<p>So do this for maybe two, three seconds, inhale,</p>
<p>then hold, two, three seconds,</p>
<p>then exhale, two, three seconds,</p>
<p>then hold, two, three seconds.</p>
<p>Most often people forget to hold.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal</p>
<p>or more or less equal durations of,</p>
<p>could be one second, could be two seconds,</p>
<p>could be three seconds.</p>
<p>Most people find that when you get out past five seconds,</p>
<p>they start to struggle to maintain</p>
<p>the so-called box breathing.</p>
<p>And most people can&rsquo;t consciously box breathe</p>
<p>for too terribly long without having to think about it.</p>
<p>But the point here is that</p>
<p>through purely mechanical means,</p>
<p>changing the way that you breathe,</p>
<p>emphasizing inhales or exhales or keeping them the same</p>
<p>will change the way that your brain works,</p>
<p>how alert you are and how well you function in anything.</p>
<p>And again, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that breathwork has no value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simply to say that</p>
<p>long extended protocols of breathwork are simply,</p>
<p>they are truly simply just an exploration</p>
<p>of this fundamental relationship</p>
<p>between the mechanics of your internal organs</p>
<p>and your brain and how your brain controls</p>
<p>those internal organs.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask, well, how is this pressure known?</p>
<p>How does the body actually know how full the lungs are?</p>
<p>Now, this is an answer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more for the aficionados out there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had a few requests,</p>
<p>or I should say thousands of requests</p>
<p>for more in-depth science.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not interested in more in-depth science,</p>
<p>just this will allow you to tune out now</p>
<p>for maybe just 10 seconds.</p>
<p>And if you are interested, pay careful attention.</p>
<p>There is a set of receptors,</p>
<p>which are called piezoreceptors, P-I-E-Z-O, piezoreceptors.</p>
<p>Piezo means pressure.</p>
<p>And these were discovered a few years ago</p>
<p>by a couple of different laboratories.</p>
<p>But one of the main ones,</p>
<p>one of the main laboratories</p>
<p>that discovered these piezoreceptors</p>
<p>is the laboratory of Ardem Parapuchin.</p>
<p>I love saying his name,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m probably mispronouncing it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend and a former colleague.</p>
<p>When my lab was down in San Diego,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s at the Scripps Institute.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,</p>
<p>which just basically means</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a total stud of science</p>
<p>and has made many important discoveries.</p>
<p>The piezoreceptors line many tissues</p>
<p>and inform the brain about pressure in those tissues.</p>
<p>But the lungs have a particular category of piezoreceptors</p>
<p>called piezo-2 receptors.</p>
<p>And as you fill your lungs</p>
<p>and these little sacks of air, the alveoli fill,</p>
<p>the piezo-2 receptors,</p>
<p>because of the way they react to that filling,</p>
<p>send information by way of a bunch of neurons,</p>
<p>a bunch of wires up to the brain</p>
<p>and tell you how full your lungs are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of mechanistic detail.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about that,</p>
<p>you can look up Ardem&rsquo;s lab at the Scripps</p>
<p>and the beautiful work that they and other laboratories</p>
<p>are doing on piezos.</p>
<p>Piezos are pretty cool.</p>
<p>I think I also just like saying piezo,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I brought that up as well.</p>
<p>So mechanical sensing of the lungs, heart, and diaphragm.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s talk about chemical sensing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s carbon dioxide and there&rsquo;s oxygen.</p>
<p>And this is really simple.</p>
<p>You have oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and you need them both.</p>
<p>I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide</p>
<p>as this bad thing and oxygen as a good thing.</p>
<p>You need them both and you need them</p>
<p>in the appropriate balance.</p>
<p>You have a collection of neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that register when carbon dioxide levels</p>
<p>get to a certain point in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>When that point, that threshold is reached,</p>
<p>these neurons fire and they cause you to breathe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes called the gasp reflex.</p>
<p>It just makes you want to inhale.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you bring in more oxygen.</p>
<p>Okay, so we don&rsquo;t really breathe to get oxygen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a byproduct of inhaling to eliminate carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to freak somebody out</p>
<p>and we do these in experiments</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t recommend you do this,</p>
<p>you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>that they inhale and the brain will go</p>
<p>into an almost immediate panic response</p>
<p>because the health of all our tissues</p>
<p>depends on keeping a nice balance</p>
<p>between carbon dioxide and oxygen.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.</p>
<p>So the impulse to breathe, if you&rsquo;re underwater</p>
<p>or if you hold your breath is triggered by these neurons</p>
<p>and the triggering of those neurons</p>
<p>comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And for those of you that don&rsquo;t quite know</p>
<p>how to conceptualize the relationship</p>
<p>between bloodstream and breath,</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And maybe you remember this from high school biology,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll make it clear for you now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules</p>
<p>in that air actually move from your lungs</p>
<p>into the bloodstream because these little avioli</p>
<p>of the lungs, those little sacks of air,</p>
<p>they basically have a lot of little micro vessels</p>
<p>and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels,</p>
<p>essentially, although they&rsquo;re mostly capillaries,</p>
<p>micro capillaries are the little tiny ones that line them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually an interface,</p>
<p>an opportunity for air and molecules within the air</p>
<p>to pass into the blood</p>
<p>and then they move in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>And when you exhale, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>So you can move things from the air into your bloodstream</p>
<p>or from your bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more detail to it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure those of you that are experts out there,</p>
<p>if you want to put some stuff in the comments,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of an kind of intermediate tutorial,</p>
<p>you might even title it intermediate tutorial.</p>
<p>If you know a lot about this, just I&rsquo;ll check it,</p>
<p>but make sure you get the details right,</p>
<p>make sure you know the process.</p>
<p>And I find that for people that are interested</p>
<p>in understanding how breathing really works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really nice to think about the relationship</p>
<p>between the heart and the vascular system,</p>
<p>the blood and the air system,</p>
<p>the respiration system and breathing,</p>
<p>because those two things are very,</p>
<p>we say they&rsquo;re interdigitated,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interwoven with one another.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s this work?</p>
<p>Well, carbon dioxide is too high.</p>
<p>You breathe in, you inspire, you inhale.</p>
<p>As a consequence, when you exhale,</p>
<p>you offload carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really cool way that you can explore</p>
<p>this chemistry of your breathing and your bloodstream</p>
<p>and the way that your brain works</p>
<p>in ways that can really benefit your health.</p>
<p>And it works the following way.</p>
<p>You want to essentially sit or lie down,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be anywhere near water,</p>
<p>not a bathtub, not a hot tub,</p>
<p>not a cold dunk or something.</p>
<p>In fact, don&rsquo;t even be in a puddle.</p>
<p>And what you want to do in this case</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to breathe in deep,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s going to increase your heart rate</p>
<p>and then exhale passively</p>
<p>by just letting air fall out of your mouth.</p>
<p>So it would look something like this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you breathe in vigorously</p>
<p>and then you let the air just fall out of your mouth.</p>
<p>When you do that, what you&rsquo;re essentially doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re bringing in a lot of oxygen</p>
<p>through that deep breath</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re exhaling a little bit of that carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s 25 or 30, somewhere in there,</p>
<p>you would essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen</p>
<p>and blowing off or exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually going to change the chemistry</p>
<p>of your internal landscape and you can then sense it.</p>
<p>You can intercept what that is like.</p>
<p>And there are some really interesting reasons</p>
<p>for wanting to do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to do all 25 or 30 now,</p>
<p>maybe do five or 10 so you can get a sense</p>
<p>of what it looks like so that it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to essentially demonstrate now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s inhale, exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>I am inhaling through the nose.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially, excuse me, a two second or so inhale</p>
<p>and then a one second or so exhale.</p>
<p>And as I was doing that,</p>
<p>I can kind of feel my face get flush</p>
<p>and my body is heating up and my brain is heating up.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening there?</p>
<p>Well, that pattern of breathing is increasing levels</p>
<p>of adrenaline in my brain and body</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting more alert.</p>
<p>Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale all your air.</p>
<p>You dump all your air.</p>
<p>You can do that, your nose or your mouth.</p>
<p>And then you hold your breath with your lungs empty</p>
<p>for about 15 to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that want to explore this</p>
<p>and please be careful as you explore this,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do anything stupid like do this while you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You can exhale all your air.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find then is you can hold your breath</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>And the reason you can do that</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;ve blown off all the carbon dioxide</p>
<p>or most of the carbon dioxide in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve shifted the chemistry of your blood</p>
<p>by breathing in a particular way.</p>
<p>And by doing that, you are no longer triggering</p>
<p>these neurons that cause the gasp reflex</p>
<p>or the reflex to breathe.</p>
<p>Now, of course you have to breathe sooner or later,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;ll find is if normally your ability</p>
<p>to hold your breath is a minute or so</p>
<p>before you really feel that gasp reflex kick in,</p>
<p>you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes.</p>
<p>And with some practice,</p>
<p>people find that they can start holding their breath</p>
<p>for three or four minutes or longer.</p>
<p>This is actually how free divers do what they do.</p>
<p>I do not want anyone free diving.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to learn free diving,</p>
<p>please learn it from an expert.</p>
<p>Many people die trying to teach themselves out of free dive</p>
<p>or trying to teach their friends out of free dive</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is not what this is about.</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t do this anywhere near water,</p>
<p>but it is a very interesting exploration</p>
<p>of how you can shift the chemistry of your bloodstream</p>
<p>by modulating your air,</p>
<p>by modulating the mechanics of your diaphragm and lungs,</p>
<p>and thereby shift the way your mind works, your brain.</p>
<p>In fact, what you&rsquo;ll notice is that even though</p>
<p>during that 25 or 30 breaths,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel very alert.</p>
<p>When you exhale all your air and you&rsquo;re in the breath hold,</p>
<p>you will feel very alert, but very, very calm.</p>
<p>Now, this is interesting because it&rsquo;s a state</p>
<p>that we all sort of want to achieve, alert but calm,</p>
<p>but have a hard time achieving.</p>
<p>And so for those of you that have a hard time</p>
<p>obtaining focus for sake of work</p>
<p>or focus for sake of anything, I should say,</p>
<p>and when you are able to achieve focus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s through the use of things like stimulants,</p>
<p>or you feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath,</p>
<p>or you have to have four espresso in order to be alert,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re too alert.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re jittery, you can&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>This pattern of breathing can lend itself very well</p>
<p>to entering states of alert, but calm for the follow,</p>
<p>the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing.</p>
<p>And then you could repeat it if you want.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very useful practice to explore.</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with this practice</p>
<p>as so-called Wim Hof breathing.</p>
<p>Wim Hof is a practitioner of what&rsquo;s called Tummo breathing.</p>
<p>Tummo breathing has been around for centuries.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are familiar with breath work</p>
<p>and yogic practices,</p>
<p>I acknowledge that nothing I just described</p>
<p>is new based on science.</p>
<p>However, the science informs why those practices work.</p>
<p>And just as a little mini editorial,</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize as well</p>
<p>that one thing that this podcast is really about</p>
<p>is trying to remove fancy nomenclature,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s yogic nomenclature</p>
<p>or scientific nomenclature</p>
<p>so that people can access protocols.</p>
<p>Because the moment we start naming things after people</p>
<p>or calling them Tummo, et cetera,</p>
<p>I have no problem with that,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t inform how the practices are done,</p>
<p>nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m trying to teach you the mechanisms.</p>
<p>And as a final point to that,</p>
<p>the most powerful form of breathing</p>
<p>is the one that takes into account</p>
<p>the fundamental mechanisms that inhales increase heart rate,</p>
<p>that exhales decrease heart rate,</p>
<p>and that carbon dioxide and oxygen</p>
<p>relate to the bloodstream and the brain in particular ways.</p>
<p>Once you understand those components,</p>
<p>then you can create your own so-called breathwork practices.</p>
<p>You can breathe in the ways that best serve you</p>
<p>as opposed to thinking that one protocol</p>
<p>is the best or holy protocol for everything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s simply not.</p>
<p>As a final, final point,</p>
<p>I want to say that as you shift the way that you breathe,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re blowing off more carbon dioxide</p>
<p>or bringing in more oxygen,</p>
<p>you are fundamentally changing the chemistry</p>
<p>of your internal milieu of your body.</p>
<p>And that has been shown to have important effects</p>
<p>on the way that your immune system functions</p>
<p>and the way that you deal with inflammation</p>
<p>and all sorts of different sort of things</p>
<p>that can enter your body and cause problems</p>
<p>or conditions of stress, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I will explore that further as the episode goes on,</p>
<p>but I want to move on to just touch on one other aspect</p>
<p>of breathing that&rsquo;s purely mechanical,</p>
<p>which I think is very interesting and important,</p>
<p>which relates to a particular reflex</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be very familiar with in a second,</p>
<p>and that can serve you very well in times of extreme stress.</p>
<p>The reflex I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is something called the Herring Brewer Reflex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into details</p>
<p>about how the Herring Brewer Reflex works,</p>
<p>but it has to do with particular classes of neurons</p>
<p>and cells that are called the baroreceptors.</p>
<p>Those are basically pressure receptors.</p>
<p>They sense pressure.</p>
<p>And basically what the Herring Brewer Reflex is about</p>
<p>is that when your lung is inflated,</p>
<p>your desire to breathe is reduced.</p>
<p>So you can try that right now.</p>
<p>You can inhale, huge big thing of air, and hold, okay?</p>
<p>Your desire to breathe will kick in later</p>
<p>than were you to exhale all your air and hold your breath.</p>
<p>When you exhale all your air and hold your breath,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve done the sort of protocol</p>
<p>I described a few minutes ago</p>
<p>of doing a bunch of inhales and exhales first,</p>
<p>in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty.</p>
<p>Those baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy,</p>
<p>saying there&rsquo;s no pressure in here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no pressure in here, I got nothing in here.</p>
<p>You need to breathe, you need to breathe,</p>
<p>and the gas reflex will kick in sooner.</p>
<p>You can apply that in all sorts of situations</p>
<p>related to exercise, related to modulating stress, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the Herring Brewer Reflex is a very powerful one.</p>
<p>This is why you take a big deep breath</p>
<p>before you go underwater, all right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to exhale all your air and go underwater.</p>
<p>If you were to exhale all your air and go underwater,</p>
<p>you would absolutely feel the need to come up sooner</p>
<p>for a breath of air than had you a full tank,</p>
<p>so to speak, lungs full of air.</p>
<p>And this is also the way that people teach themselves</p>
<p>to feel comfortable underwater.</p>
<p>So when you learn how to swim,</p>
<p>you learn how to swim both by having air in your lungs</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re underwater,</p>
<p>and no air in your lungs while you&rsquo;re underwater.</p>
<p>In any event, the Herring Brewer Reflex</p>
<p>is yet another dimension to the way</p>
<p>that mechanical pressure influences</p>
<p>your brain&rsquo;s decision-making about what to do with your body,</p>
<p>in this case, whether or not to breathe.</p>
<p>So now I want to shift away from breathing</p>
<p>and diaphragm and lungs</p>
<p>and move toward another organ within our viscera,</p>
<p>which is our gut.</p>
<p>So this includes our stomach and our intestines,</p>
<p>our esophagus, and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said before, both by me and by others,</p>
<p>that we are but a series of tubes,</p>
<p>and indeed that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube.</p>
<p>Your brain is actually a tube</p>
<p>that connects to your spinal cord, which is also a tube.</p>
<p>You started off as a tube.</p>
<p>You were like a churro.</p>
<p>You know those churros?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with churros,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like donuts that are shaped like a tube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what you look like early in development,</p>
<p>not long after conception.</p>
<p>And the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew,</p>
<p>but you always maintained a hollow through that tube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have what are called ventricles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gaps or a space in your brain and spinal cord</p>
<p>that run the length of your brain and spinal cord,</p>
<p>and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid,</p>
<p>and other things move through that space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to return to the ventricles later.</p>
<p>They are very, very important.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just space filled with fluid, but they do a lot.</p>
<p>Similarly, your digestive system</p>
<p>starts with the tube at your mouth,</p>
<p>and of course goes down through your throat,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got all the elements</p>
<p>of the stomach and the intestines,</p>
<p>and then it comes out the other end.</p>
<p>So you are, but a series of different tubes,</p>
<p>your vascular system, a series of other tubes.</p>
<p>So your tubes, the way your digestive system works</p>
<p>is to communicate to your brain about the status</p>
<p>of the mechanical pressures along this tube.</p>
<p>So within your stomach and your intestines, et cetera,</p>
<p>and the chemical status of that tube</p>
<p>at various portions within that tube,</p>
<p>to inform your brain about how your brain</p>
<p>should control that tube.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the mechanical sensing of your gut.</p>
<p>If you drink a lot of fluid, or if you eat a lot of food,</p>
<p>your gut will fill up, your stomach will fill up with food.</p>
<p>Now it gets digested there,</p>
<p>it gets digested elsewhere</p>
<p>along your digestive tract too, of course,</p>
<p>but it starts getting digested there</p>
<p>because along this tube,</p>
<p>you have a series of what are called sphincters,</p>
<p>which basically are like little droplets.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had a laundry bag</p>
<p>which has a drawstring on it,</p>
<p>you pull it and then it cinches shut,</p>
<p>and then you can open it again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what those are, those are sphincter openings.</p>
<p>And you have them in your throat,</p>
<p>you have them along your digestive tract</p>
<p>all the way to the end.</p>
<p>Food will enter your gut,</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s a lot of that food,</p>
<p>pressure receptors, some of which are these piezo receptors,</p>
<p>will communicate to the areas of your brain</p>
<p>that are involved in feeding,</p>
<p>and will say, don&rsquo;t eat anymore.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to consume anymore.</p>
<p>Now, some people bypass that.</p>
<p>These, I guess they have these</p>
<p>like hotdog eating competitions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always struck by how some of those people</p>
<p>are like, seem to be rail thin,</p>
<p>but they actually train for those competitions</p>
<p>by ingesting large volumes of water.</p>
<p>Actually a very dangerous practice.</p>
<p>You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water,</p>
<p>and you can kill yourself by ingesting</p>
<p>too much of anything really to expand your gut.</p>
<p>Not a good practice, not a big fan of those competitions,</p>
<p>but even if you&rsquo;re one of those people</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re the world heavyweight champion of them,</p>
<p>they are informative toward what I&rsquo;m talking about now,</p>
<p>which is that as you expand the gut,</p>
<p>a signal is sent by neurons,</p>
<p>literally nerve cells that are in the gut to the brainstem</p>
<p>up to the areas of the brain that are involved in feeding.</p>
<p>I did a whole episode on feeding.</p>
<p>You can find on feeding metabolism and hunger.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to listen to that episode if you like,</p>
<p>and it will shut down the neurons</p>
<p>that drive the desire to put more stuff in your mouth.</p>
<p>That thing that people say sometimes on,</p>
<p>well, in this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t put another bite in my mouth.</p>
<p>Literally they shut down some of the basic movements</p>
<p>of the musculature to take another fork bite.</p>
<p>I know it sounds crazy,</p>
<p>but they can actually control your brain.</p>
<p>So your gut is so full that it&rsquo;s controlling your brain</p>
<p>such that this action of spooning food</p>
<p>towards your mouth is actually inhibited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made more difficult or less likely to occur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>The converse is also true.</p>
<p>When these piezo receptors signal to the brain</p>
<p>that the gut is empty,</p>
<p>independent of your need, your actual need for food,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a signal that&rsquo;s sent to your brain</p>
<p>that says gut is empty and neurons get stimulated</p>
<p>in areas like the arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>and these areas of the hypothalamus, et cetera,</p>
<p>that drive the desire to make this action,</p>
<p>to open the mouth and to put stuff in it,</p>
<p>in particular food.</p>
<p>So when you find yourself at the refrigerator</p>
<p>or you find yourself almost, you know,</p>
<p>manically trying to get food of different kinds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even thinking about what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so hungry.</p>
<p>In part, that&rsquo;s because the lack of food in your gut</p>
<p>has sent that information to your brain</p>
<p>and is driving particular fixed action patterns</p>
<p>that are associated with eating.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the first things children learn how to do</p>
<p>is open their mouth when something is presented to it.</p>
<p>And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very good at it at first,</p>
<p>they get all over the place,</p>
<p>but eventually they get good at it,</p>
<p>at least most people get good at it.</p>
<p>If you watch how people eat, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of variable out there.</p>
<p>In any event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon</p>
<p>and this purely mechanical phenomenon</p>
<p>is driving our brain to drive certain behavior.</p>
<p>You can get better at registering sense of fullness</p>
<p>or lack of fullness in a very particular way.</p>
<p>Some people have a very keen sense</p>
<p>of how full or empty their stomach is.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve eaten anything,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a small volume of food</p>
<p>in the last hour to three hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a worthwhile practice to take a few moments,</p>
<p>maybe 10, 20 seconds,</p>
<p>and actually just try and concentrate on sensing</p>
<p>the neurons in your gut and how full you are.</p>
<p>Like for instance, I ate a few hours ago</p>
<p>and I had a little snack about 30 minutes ago or so,</p>
<p>and my gut feels neither terribly full nor terribly empty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, I would put it at kind of like 30, 40%.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So by just taking conscious awareness</p>
<p>of how full or empty our gut is at various times,</p>
<p>between meals, after a meal, before a meal,</p>
<p>you can very quickly develop a sense</p>
<p>of how full or empty you are.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the consequence of that?</p>
<p>The consequence of that is actually rather interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown that the consequence of that</p>
<p>is actually that you can better override</p>
<p>the signals of these piezo receptors</p>
<p>and gut fullness or emptiness.</p>
<p>So for those of you that find that you eat</p>
<p>kind of compulsively or non-consciously,</p>
<p>or subconsciously, I should say,</p>
<p>you probably have to be conscious enough</p>
<p>to be awake to eat, but subconsciously,</p>
<p>you just find yourself eating,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m describing myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a drive-by blueberry eater.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a bowl of blueberries,</p>
<p>every time I walk past it,</p>
<p>I sort of have to grab a handful of them</p>
<p>and pop them in my mouth.</p>
<p>But if you develop this sense of how much mechanopressure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a word,</p>
<p>but how much mechanosensation is in your gut,</p>
<p>very quickly, you can learn to override that.</p>
<p>You might ask, why would I want to be able to override</p>
<p>whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full?</p>
<p>Well, there are many reasons to want to do that.</p>
<p>Many people right now are interested</p>
<p>in so-called intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing fasts of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours</p>
<p>every 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what my practice is.</p>
<p>I do that on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Sometimes, yeah, I eat breakfast,</p>
<p>but normally I push breakfast out to about 11 or noon,</p>
<p>or sometimes a little later.</p>
<p>Some people are doing longer fasts,</p>
<p>and there are really wonderful data</p>
<p>published in excellent journals</p>
<p>from my colleague Sachin Panda</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies,</p>
<p>and of course, from other laboratories</p>
<p>showing that intermittent fasting</p>
<p>can and will have some positive health effects</p>
<p>on things like liver health and brain health</p>
<p>and other aspects of health.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s the best form of dieting</p>
<p>for the sake of losing weight, that&rsquo;s very controversial,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that having a period of fasting</p>
<p>every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time</p>
<p>can be beneficial because it stimulates</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called autophagy,</p>
<p>the clearing away or the body&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to eat certain dead cells, so-called senescent cells,</p>
<p>and for many people, they struggle with fasting</p>
<p>because they feel they have a very keen sense</p>
<p>of their stomach being empty,</p>
<p>and they feel as if they have to eat,</p>
<p>and in a kind of counterintuitive way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some data that indicate that being able to sense</p>
<p>whether or not your gut is full or empty</p>
<p>and just the knowledge</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s communicating information to your brain</p>
<p>about whether or not to eat or not,</p>
<p>just that awareness, that understanding</p>
<p>allows them to override the signal.</p>
<p>They think, oh, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually in need of nutrients right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that my stomach is empty,</p>
<p>and these piezoreceptors and some other ones</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll tell you about in a moment</p>
<p>are signaling to my brain that it&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually need food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that my brain is reacting</p>
<p>to the fact that my gut is deflated, so to speak,</p>
<p>or smaller, doesn&rsquo;t have food in it.</p>
<p>So there are other ways</p>
<p>that our guts communicate with our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just our stomach talking to our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also our intestines talk to our brain.</p>
<p>The Lieberles Lab, the guy&rsquo;s name is Steven Lieberles.</p>
<p>He runs a lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific lab,</p>
<p>does excellent work on gut-brain communication</p>
<p>and other aspects of viscera-brain communication.</p>
<p>They discovered a category of neurons</p>
<p>called the GLP-1R neurons.</p>
<p>These are neurons that are basically in your neck.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re part of the nervous system,</p>
<p>but they can be found near your neck,</p>
<p>and those neurons send little wires</p>
<p>down into the intestines and deep into the stomach,</p>
<p>but mostly into the intestines,</p>
<p>and they sense stretch of your intestines.</p>
<p>So this is pretty wild.</p>
<p>These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines are</p>
<p>and how fast things are moving through your intestines,</p>
<p>slow or fast, or if there&rsquo;s nothing there,</p>
<p>and then those neurons send another branch.</p>
<p>So they have a branch in one direction,</p>
<p>senses what&rsquo;s going on in your intestines,</p>
<p>and they have another branch that goes up from your neck</p>
<p>into your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more</p>
<p>or to stop eating.</p>
<p>So these are really, really cool neurons,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically stretch receptors.</p>
<p>They look a lot like the piezo receptors</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>So these GLP-1R neurons are sensing stretch,</p>
<p>so purely mechanical sensing,</p>
<p>and in addition to that,</p>
<p>the Liberlis lab discovered neurons</p>
<p>that detect nutrients themselves.</p>
<p>Now, the main reason why we need to eat</p>
<p>is to bring nutrients into our body,</p>
<p>and there is another set of neurons.</p>
<p>Those are called GPR65 neurons.</p>
<p>If you want to know, they don&rsquo;t have to remember that,</p>
<p>that do the same thing in terms of their connections.</p>
<p>They send connections down into the intestines</p>
<p>and into the gut, into the stomach,</p>
<p>but mostly into the intestines,</p>
<p>and then send that information back up to the brain</p>
<p>as to whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients</p>
<p>in our digestive tract.</p>
<p>Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about chemical signaling,</p>
<p>and in the next couple of minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you about how you can understand hunger</p>
<p>and how to modulate your hunger for the right foods,</p>
<p>in fact, for healthy foods.</p>
<p>The way this is done</p>
<p>is by leveraging the activity of these GPR65 neurons,</p>
<p>these neurons that sense nutrients, okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling your brain</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in your gut and intestines,</p>
<p>and you have another set of neurons</p>
<p>that were discovered by another guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out at Duke University.</p>
<p>His name is Diego, excuse me, Diego, Diego Borges.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a wonderful scientist.</p>
<p>He has a degree in nutrition, but also in neuroscience,</p>
<p>and he found that there are neurons that line the gut,</p>
<p>and those neurons, in collaboration with these GPR65 neurons</p>
<p>are sensing for three things, okay?</p>
<p>So we say nutrients, which nutrients are they looking for?</p>
<p>What are these neurons paying attention to?</p>
<p>Well, these neurons are activated</p>
<p>by the presence of fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>sorts of things that come from fatty fish, fish oil, krill,</p>
<p>certain kinds of animal and plant substances.</p>
<p>You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s,</p>
<p>and those omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically,</p>
<p>like crazy up to the brain,</p>
<p>and make you want to eat more of those things,</p>
<p>but it turns out in pretty appropriate levels.</p>
<p>These neurons also respond to amino acids.</p>
<p>So when you eat a food, it&rsquo;s broken down in the gut.</p>
<p>Actually, the way it&rsquo;s broken down in the gut</p>
<p>is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Your gut basically cinches off a sphincter up top,</p>
<p>cinches off a sphincter below it when there&rsquo;s food there,</p>
<p>and then you have a series of smooth muscles</p>
<p>that tumble the food and literally physically break it down,</p>
<p>and then of course, enzymes come in</p>
<p>and start digesting the food,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about digestion</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s communicated to the brain in a moment,</p>
<p>and for those of you with any autoimmune issues</p>
<p>or digestive issues,</p>
<p>this is going to be a very important conversation,</p>
<p>but meanwhile, there are these neurons in the gut,</p>
<p>and as these fatty acids float out of the digested food,</p>
<p>so literally fat molecules,</p>
<p>and as amino acids are coming from the proteins</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re digested in the gut,</p>
<p>and as a third food item,</p>
<p>sugars are coming from the foods that we eat.</p>
<p>These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says,</p>
<p>hey, whatever you&rsquo;re doing up there, do more of it, okay?</p>
<p>Now, the sugars are a little bit cryptic</p>
<p>because when I say sugars or I say amino acids</p>
<p>or I say fatty acids, this has nothing to do with taste.</p>
<p>In fact, beautiful experiments have been done</p>
<p>by the Borges Lab and by other labs showing</p>
<p>that even if you numb the mouth,</p>
<p>even if you gavage, which is a really just a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fancy word for basically tube feeding.</p>
<p>You put a tube down in the gut,</p>
<p>you just deliver the food to the gut,</p>
<p>so you get no opportunity to taste it.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty awful.</p>
<p>If you force feed by gavage or you numb the mouth,</p>
<p>these neurons don&rsquo;t care about the mouth.</p>
<p>They only care about the nutrients coming from these foods,</p>
<p>and then they signal to the brain, hey, do that thing.</p>
<p>Do that thing where you lift that object,</p>
<p>which we call a fork or a spoon.</p>
<p>Do that thing where you drink the milkshake.</p>
<p>Do that thing where you move your mouth like this,</p>
<p>not talking, but do that thing where you swallow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the nutrients in our gut control us.</p>
<p>And this is why for people</p>
<p>that experience extreme sugar cravings</p>
<p>or even mild sugar cravings,</p>
<p>replacing those foods with foods</p>
<p>that have high levels of omega-3</p>
<p>or amino acids can reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this on a previous episode,</p>
<p>but if you didn&rsquo;t catch it, no big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you right now that for many people,</p>
<p>the solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount,</p>
<p>maybe a teaspoon or so of an amino acid called glutamine.</p>
<p>And if you have really extreme sugar cravings,</p>
<p>you can even mix that glutamine with a full fat cream,</p>
<p>which actually makes it taste pretty darn good.</p>
<p>And you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving,</p>
<p>just a sip or two of that.</p>
<p>And what you find is that the sugar cravings disappear</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically giving fat and amino acids</p>
<p>to those neurons in the gut and in the intestine</p>
<p>that signal to the brain that you want more.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t give you a kind of runaway hunger</p>
<p>for full fat cream,</p>
<p>although it will say when I was in high school</p>
<p>for various reasons,</p>
<p>but mostly because I liked the way it tastes.</p>
<p>I was using half and half in my cereal</p>
<p>and I was waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and drinking half and half.</p>
<p>And that stuff tastes pretty darn good</p>
<p>once you get used to the high fat content,</p>
<p>not something I do now.</p>
<p>But the point is these neurons don&rsquo;t really know taste,</p>
<p>they only know nutrients.</p>
<p>And so you can work with that system.</p>
<p>If you crave sugar,</p>
<p>and I do believe that most, if not all of us,</p>
<p>should be trying to limit, if not eliminate simple sugars</p>
<p>as much as possible most of the time,</p>
<p>then things like glutamine,</p>
<p>things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera,</p>
<p>maybe even want to supplement with fish oil</p>
<p>or something similar to get omega-3s,</p>
<p>there are other reasons for wanting to do that too,</p>
<p>can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about is interoception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your ability to sense your inner real estate,</p>
<p>but in this case, by way of chemical signaling,</p>
<p>not by way of mechanical signaling.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to talk about another aspect</p>
<p>of gut chemistry that has profound effects on the brain,</p>
<p>as well as on the immune system.</p>
<p>And for those of you with autoimmune conditions,</p>
<p>or for those of you that know people</p>
<p>with autoimmune conditions,</p>
<p>this is going to be a very important discussion.</p>
<p>Your gut needs to maintain a certain level</p>
<p>of acidity or alkalinity.</p>
<p>For those of you without any chemistry background,</p>
<p>basically the low numbers on the pH scale,</p>
<p>that means more acidic.</p>
<p>The higher the numbers, more alkaline.</p>
<p>So more alkaline means more basic,</p>
<p>and acidic means acidic.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the number of hydrogen atoms</p>
<p>and all this other stuff,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to pH your gut right now,</p>
<p>but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut.</p>
<p>Your gut needs to be more acidic</p>
<p>than essentially all other tissues of your body</p>
<p>in order to function properly.</p>
<p>Bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.</p>
<p>I think this is important for people to understand.</p>
<p>People are always thinking,</p>
<p>oh, you should be more alkaline.</p>
<p>Being acidic, that almost sounds like being inflamed.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s a complicated discussion,</p>
<p>but I think the semantics can be confusing sometimes.</p>
<p>You want your gut to be acidic.</p>
<p>You may ask, well, why are people taking anti-acids?</p>
<p>Well, those anti-acids are there for a particular purpose</p>
<p>to essentially combat acid reflux,</p>
<p>which is the sending up of stuff in the gut</p>
<p>towards the esophagus,</p>
<p>and it can cause heartburn and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And the way that anti-acids work</p>
<p>is they essentially cause the sphincters</p>
<p>above the gut to cinch shut,</p>
<p>but they really are only dealing with a symptom,</p>
<p>not the cause.</p>
<p>So rewind about 10, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>the discussion about gut acidity</p>
<p>was quite a bit different than it is now</p>
<p>in the scientific and medical literature.</p>
<p>In fact, for many years,</p>
<p>long before I&rsquo;m going to say it here,</p>
<p>people have been saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important to maintain proper acidity of the gut,</p>
<p>but the science and medical professions</p>
<p>sort of looked at that as a kind of a scant,</p>
<p>like, you know, what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any evidence</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s actually true.</p>
<p>There are communities of people that were prescribing,</p>
<p>or I should say recommending</p>
<p>that people take hydrochloric acid, HCL,</p>
<p>and adjusting gut acidity that way,</p>
<p>and it was kind of frowned upon.</p>
<p>Now, in looking over the peer-reviewed literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that this business</p>
<p>of trying to make the gut a little more acidic</p>
<p>is actually one way in which people treat</p>
<p>or try and ameliorate acid reflux.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of counterintuitive,</p>
<p>increasing acidity in the gut to try and reduce acid reflux.</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re supposed to take antacids.</p>
<p>Well, the field has shifted quite a bit,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re going to review what it is</p>
<p>to maintain the chemistry of the gut</p>
<p>at a slightly more acidic level,</p>
<p>or a more acidic level, I should say,</p>
<p>because it turns out that there are a number of things</p>
<p>that are in gut, I just call it what it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gastric juice, sounds kind of gross,</p>
<p>but gastric juices are actually powerful modulators</p>
<p>of brain state.</p>
<p>Put differently, one of the best things that you can do</p>
<p>to have a healthy brain, a well-functioning brain,</p>
<p>and a healthy and well-functioning body</p>
<p>is to maintain proper gut chemistry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s basically accomplished</p>
<p>by getting the right level of acidity</p>
<p>and alkalinity in your gut.</p>
<p>Now, this is not quack pseudoscience,</p>
<p>this is not based on cleanses or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re going to talk about now</p>
<p>are peer-reviewed data in very high-quality journals</p>
<p>like the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is one of the three apex journals,</p>
<p>Science, Nature, Cell,</p>
<p>and journals of that sort that point to the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and its relationship to acidity of the gut</p>
<p>and how the gut microbiome can help enhance</p>
<p>autoimmune function and various other aspects</p>
<p>of brain and body health.</p>
<p>So within all the mucosal line tissues of our body,</p>
<p>we have what are called microbiota,</p>
<p>little microorganisms that we didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>that actually come from our environment or our food</p>
<p>and live inside us,</p>
<p>and there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota.</p>
<p>Whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota</p>
<p>depends on one thing,</p>
<p>and that one thing is how acid or alkaline</p>
<p>the given mucosal tissue is.</p>
<p>So we actually have a microbiome in our nose,</p>
<p>and just as a very brief aside,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say this,</p>
<p>if you emphasize nasal breathing most of the time,</p>
<p>except when speaking or eating,</p>
<p>and if you downplay mouth breathing,</p>
<p>meaning you refrain from mouth breathing,</p>
<p>especially in sleep,</p>
<p>you improve the nasal microbiome.</p>
<p>It gets better at fighting off infections.</p>
<p>This was shown in a beautiful paper</p>
<p>published in Cell Reports last year,</p>
<p>and that paper I should mention was performed in humans.</p>
<p>So you got a microbiome in your nose,</p>
<p>and by nasal breathing most of the time,</p>
<p>not all the time,</p>
<p>because there can be times</p>
<p>when you need to breathe through your mouth</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>hard exercise or eating or speaking,</p>
<p>but by breathing through your nose most of the time,</p>
<p>you are creating an additional layer of immune defense</p>
<p>against particles that could get you sick,</p>
<p>whereas when you mouth breathe,</p>
<p>you are taking down a layer of defense</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting yourself more at risk of infection.</p>
<p>This is what this paper shows.</p>
<p>You also have a gut microbiome that is in your throat,</p>
<p>in your stomach and in your intestines,</p>
<p>and that gut microbiome is extremely powerful</p>
<p>in regulating your mood and your immune function.</p>
<p>Now, this is not something that you can sense directly.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know when you have a bunch of good microbiota</p>
<p>or a bunch of bad microbiota</p>
<p>because you can feel them moving around in there.</p>
<p>Actually, that would be pretty awful.</p>
<p>That would be pretty creepy feeling.</p>
<p>Rather, according to whether or not your gut is alkaline</p>
<p>or acidic in the appropriate ways,</p>
<p>you will populate your gut with the appropriate microbiota.</p>
<p>So you want your stomach to be pretty acidic,</p>
<p>but other elements of your digestive tract</p>
<p>are going to be more pH.</p>
<p>And basically there&rsquo;s a gradient,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s a low to high pH gradient along the gut.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know what the pH</p>
<p>should be at any one given point</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to go and put microbiota</p>
<p>at one location and not another.</p>
<p>What you essentially want to do is create an environment</p>
<p>where the proper microbiota can thrive.</p>
<p>Because when you do that,</p>
<p>you greatly decrease what are called inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>So these are things that are secreted</p>
<p>both by cells within the body and cells within the brain</p>
<p>to impact brain health and brain function and bodily health.</p>
<p>They go by a particular name.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something called TNF-alpha,</p>
<p>tumor necrosis factor alpha.</p>
<p>It is inflammatory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good thing to have at elevated levels.</p>
<p>You have something called interleukin-6, IL-6.</p>
<p>Also causes inflammation, causes damage to tissues.</p>
<p>Not a good thing to have elevated for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And then you have anti-inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>things like interleukin-10, which reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>And there are hundreds of these,</p>
<p>if not thousands of these different cytokines,</p>
<p>some of which promote inflammation,</p>
<p>some of which reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>The simple way to adjust these things in the proper ratios</p>
<p>is to adjust your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The best way to adjust your microbiome</p>
<p>is to ingest certain types of foods.</p>
<p>So there is a beautiful literature on this now,</p>
<p>but the most important literature</p>
<p>is the one that I referred to</p>
<p>at the beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>which is what to ingest and what not to ingest</p>
<p>in terms of foods in order to create</p>
<p>the best conditions in your gut</p>
<p>so that you can create the best conditions</p>
<p>in your brain and body.</p>
<p>There was a study done by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Justin&rsquo;s actually my upstairs neighbor</p>
<p>in the building at Stanford where I work.</p>
<p>And they explored how different foods</p>
<p>or different diets, I should say,</p>
<p>impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>And this is a beautiful study</p>
<p>because it was done in hundreds of human patients.</p>
<p>These actually weren&rsquo;t patients that were sick.</p>
<p>I should say human subjects that were otherwise healthy</p>
<p>from a huge variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>So you had men, you had women,</p>
<p>you had people of different races, different ethnicities.</p>
<p>You had a huge range of backgrounds</p>
<p>and they tracked all of that.</p>
<p>And what they did is they explored two types of diets.</p>
<p>One is a high fiber diet.</p>
<p>So dietary fibers are non-digestible</p>
<p>or only partially digestible carbohydrates typically.</p>
<p>And they compared that to diets that were unchanged</p>
<p>except for the inclusion of a few to a few more servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods each day.</p>
<p>Things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi.</p>
<p>They even explored, sounds pretty disgusting to me,</p>
<p>but who knows, I&rsquo;ve never tried it,</p>
<p>which is fermented cottage cheese.</p>
<p>And what they found was that after initial period</p>
<p>of a few weeks where they had people</p>
<p>either eat a lot of fiber or eat one or two servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods, they had those people ramp up</p>
<p>their ingestion of either fiber or fermented foods.</p>
<p>So they kind of ease them into it.</p>
<p>So they went baseline, then ramp up to the point</p>
<p>where they were ingesting four or five servings of fiber</p>
<p>or of fermented foods per day, which sounds like a lot,</p>
<p>but for fermented foods, that would be four</p>
<p>or five tablespoons of sauerkraut or kimchi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite, it&rsquo;s not like huge platefuls</p>
<p>of fermented foods.</p>
<p>And then they looked at a number of things.</p>
<p>They looked at the proteome, which is a kind of like looking</p>
<p>at the genome, but a bunch of proteins</p>
<p>that are made in the body.</p>
<p>And they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples,</p>
<p>and they did this by blood draw, which is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real power of this study.</p>
<p>In fact, the most comprehensive study that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>By looking at these different tissues</p>
<p>across long periods of time, so many, many weeks,</p>
<p>and then returning people to the diet that they were on</p>
<p>before they went into the study,</p>
<p>they were able to establish in a causal way</p>
<p>how ingesting fibers or fibrous foods</p>
<p>versus ingesting these fermented foods on a daily basis</p>
<p>could impact the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and many, many inflammatory markers</p>
<p>and many, many markers of immune function</p>
<p>and autoimmune function.</p>
<p>And the takeaway message from this study</p>
<p>is that the fermented foods far outperformed</p>
<p>the high fiber diet.</p>
<p>In fact, the high fiber diet in some people was beneficial</p>
<p>and in other people caused issues with inflammation.</p>
<p>This is very different than what I was taught growing up</p>
<p>and what many of us were taught.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they also observed that people</p>
<p>that ate the high fiber diet had increases</p>
<p>in certain enzymes that lend themselves</p>
<p>to better digestion of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an important insight to come from this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we kind of live in the age of extremes</p>
<p>where people seem to either want to be carnivore,</p>
<p>like never ingest a vegetable.</p>
<p>I hear they don&rsquo;t even, they&rsquo;re like allowed pepper,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not even allowed sauerkraut or something,</p>
<p>like very extreme or pure plant-based, pure vegan,</p>
<p>or pure, so essentially pure carbohydrate</p>
<p>or pure animal protein, very extreme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an omnivore.</p>
<p>I like to eat a mixture of different things</p>
<p>at different times of days, but very extreme.</p>
<p>But this is interesting because what these data show</p>
<p>is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate,</p>
<p>high fiber diet, which is really what these,</p>
<p>the high fiber condition really was,</p>
<p>actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates.</p>
<p>This may explain why people who are used</p>
<p>to a kind of more paleo type or carnivore type diet</p>
<p>might eat carbohydrates and say,</p>
<p>oh, that doesn&rsquo;t work for me, I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>It might also explain why people</p>
<p>who predominantly eat plant-based foods</p>
<p>and carbohydrate foods will try eating meat</p>
<p>as an experiment or because they lost a bet</p>
<p>or whatever it is, or desperation, or they&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll say, oh, I don&rsquo;t feel good when I eat meat.</p>
<p>How good you feel, it seems,</p>
<p>how well you can utilize that food</p>
<p>and how much of that food you crave may be determined.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears is determined</p>
<p>by your food eating history, the types of food you eat.</p>
<p>And I think this might explain some of the divide</p>
<p>and hopefully might bridge some of the chasm</p>
<p>between these different groups</p>
<p>that are saying it should be one way</p>
<p>or it should be another.</p>
<p>But at the core of the study was the bigger message.</p>
<p>The bigger message is that all of us should be ingesting</p>
<p>on a regular basis, daily basis,</p>
<p>two to four servings of fermented foods of different kinds.</p>
<p>And why I say that is</p>
<p>because the inflammatory markers went down.</p>
<p>The markers of autoimmune disruption went down</p>
<p>and the chemistry of the gut, therefore,</p>
<p>was adjusted in the appropriate ways.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not to say that high fiber is bad</p>
<p>or that fiber is bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want people to confuse this.</p>
<p>But even though this is a discussion about interoception,</p>
<p>about sensing the self,</p>
<p>this is a subconscious mechanism</p>
<p>by which the gut communicates to many, many organs,</p>
<p>including the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown in other studies,</p>
<p>also in quality peer review journals,</p>
<p>that when the correct gut microbiota are present</p>
<p>and these inflammatory markers are reduced,</p>
<p>cognition improves, so ability to focus,</p>
<p>ability to sleep, ability to ward off infection</p>
<p>and wound healing all enhanced.</p>
<p>In fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,</p>
<p>in people that struggle with various mental conditions</p>
<p>or disorders of the mind,</p>
<p>improving the gut microbiome seems to have powerful effects</p>
<p>on improving brain symptoms.</p>
<p>Along the lines of autoimmunity,</p>
<p>there are a number of conditions</p>
<p>that we call autoimmune conditions.</p>
<p>And we will do entire episodes about these going forward.</p>
<p>But for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome,</p>
<p>for people with Crohn&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is a kind of an immune system self-attack</p>
<p>on one&rsquo;s thyroid gland,</p>
<p>and things like eczema, skin conditions,</p>
<p>adjusting the gut microbiome has been shown to be useful</p>
<p>in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of those.</p>
<p>Will it fix those conditions entirely?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>But can it have a significant positive impact on them?</p>
<p>Probably yes.</p>
<p>There is one thing that&rsquo;s worth mentioning in that list,</p>
<p>which is leaky gut.</p>
<p>What is leaky gut?</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re talking about the guts.</p>
<p>What is it to have a leaky gut?</p>
<p>It sounds awful.</p>
<p>It sounds like something sort of like leaking out</p>
<p>the end of the tube and maybe that too, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But leaky gut is actually because your gut</p>
<p>is not a tube that&rsquo;s continuous one cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually made up of many, many cells.</p>
<p>And those cells form a barrier</p>
<p>and they form what are called tight junctions.</p>
<p>So if you have two cells and you want to create a fence</p>
<p>out of those cells, you bind them together.</p>
<p>The way that the body does this is to bind them together</p>
<p>with what are called tight junctions.</p>
<p>These are, they go by names like Cloudins</p>
<p>and things like that, if you want to look them up.</p>
<p>These tight junctions form a nice barrier</p>
<p>like a cyclone fence that things can&rsquo;t get past,</p>
<p>but like a cyclone fence,</p>
<p>only molecules of a certain size can go through those holes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not going to pass a soccer ball</p>
<p>through an intact cyclone fence, but you could pass</p>
<p>for instance, a feather through that fence.</p>
<p>So leaky gut is when the conditions</p>
<p>in the gut are too alkaline</p>
<p>or the gut microbiota are off in the gut,</p>
<p>meaning microbiota that like alkaline guts</p>
<p>are living there.</p>
<p>And those tight junctions can&rsquo;t function</p>
<p>at that particular pH.</p>
<p>And you create little holes in that fence.</p>
<p>And then what happens is when you ingest foods,</p>
<p>some of those foods literally leak out of the gut</p>
<p>and into the extracellular space and into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And because foods include proteins</p>
<p>and antibodies react to proteins,</p>
<p>what ends up happening in leaky gut,</p>
<p>and the reason we talk about it in autoimmune conditions</p>
<p>is that you start developing antibodies</p>
<p>to particular food proteins.</p>
<p>And then people start feeling like they have food allergies</p>
<p>and they do, they actually create particular food allergies.</p>
<p>Now, one way to prevent leaky gut is to get the rest</p>
<p>of the gut situation happy by ingesting the proper foods</p>
<p>that we talked about before, ingesting fermented foods</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The other is our old friend glutamine again.</p>
<p>There are some data and I should say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a limited number of studies showing</p>
<p>that ingesting glutamine anywhere from one to three,</p>
<p>excuse me, teaspoons per day can help alleviate leaky gut.</p>
<p>Now, the mechanism for that still isn&rsquo;t clear</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s adjusting pH</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s creating more favorable environment</p>
<p>for the microbiota, but it is clear that supplementing</p>
<p>with glutamine can in some people enhance</p>
<p>or I should say improve conditions of leaky gut.</p>
<p>So that might be useful as well.</p>
<p>And then the final thing about this I want to talk about</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re talking about chemical sensing in the gut</p>
<p>and how that impacts wellbeing is about gut acidity.</p>
<p>And this, I confess is a little bit controversial.</p>
<p>Some people are on board this, other people are not.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d love your feedback on this.</p>
<p>If you agree, please tell me, if you disagree,</p>
<p>please tell me, but please tell me why you disagree</p>
<p>in particular experience or data, although it&rsquo;s always better</p>
<p>if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies.</p>
<p>There is a practice that some people embrace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending people necessarily do this</p>
<p>and you would definitely want to talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>but where people have food allergies</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re having mood or auto-immune issues</p>
<p>and they treat this.</p>
<p>Some people recommend treating this through the ingestion</p>
<p>of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets.</p>
<p>Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?</p>
<p>Acids can burn you.</p>
<p>They literally can melt away skin.</p>
<p>You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly.</p>
<p>But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form</p>
<p>in capsule or pill form.</p>
<p>And there is a practice of starting to ingest</p>
<p>one or two hydrochloric acid tablets</p>
<p>midway through a meal.</p>
<p>And then what people will generally do is examine</p>
<p>to see whether or not that improves their symptoms</p>
<p>of indigestion, how it relates to mood,</p>
<p>how it relates to wellbeing,</p>
<p>how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera.</p>
<p>By changing the acidity, you also change the way</p>
<p>that the gut communicates with the brain</p>
<p>through the mechanisms we talked about before.</p>
<p>And there are a growing number of people embracing</p>
<p>these practices of taking HCL.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often combined with other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually combined with an enzyme.</p>
<p>And that enzyme is pepsin.</p>
<p>So most of these supplements come in the form</p>
<p>betaine HCL pepsin.</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re not a cure-all,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to suggest that they&rsquo;re a cure-all,</p>
<p>many people that have a hard time adjusting the pH</p>
<p>of their gut and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota</p>
<p>of their gut in the appropriate ways have benefited</p>
<p>from taking these betaine HCL pepsin tablets</p>
<p>or capsules during meals.</p>
<p>And the general instruction is to start slow,</p>
<p>to start with one or two,</p>
<p>and then to find a level that you&rsquo;re comfortable with</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t create an excessive feeling of warmth</p>
<p>in the stomach, that doesn&rsquo;t throw off your digestion.</p>
<p>So it takes a little bit of experimentation.</p>
<p>Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider</p>
<p>before exploring this.</p>
<p>But this has become a very common practice</p>
<p>for people with autoimmune disorders</p>
<p>and accessing the gut because it is accessible</p>
<p>by taking things has also become a way</p>
<p>in which people with various mental conditions</p>
<p>are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing.</p>
<p>Along these lines, I do want to mention</p>
<p>that there are studies that show that people</p>
<p>that supplement with a lot of probiotics</p>
<p>or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t discussed a lot</p>
<p>and the data are a little all over the place,</p>
<p>but it is worth thinking about.</p>
<p>The goal here is not to create</p>
<p>as many microbiota as possible.</p>
<p>What you want is microbiota diversity.</p>
<p>And I should mention this again</p>
<p>in reference to the Sonnenberg study,</p>
<p>which was what the high fiber diet does</p>
<p>is it increases certain microbiota,</p>
<p>but it limits their diversity.</p>
<p>And what the fermented food diet does,</p>
<p>or I should say the diet that includes regular ingestion</p>
<p>of fermented foods, a few servings a day,</p>
<p>is it increases microbiota diversity.</p>
<p>Now, lack of microbiota diversity</p>
<p>has a name in the medical profession.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called dysbiosis and dysbiosis is bad.</p>
<p>Dysbiosis is what you see when people are spending</p>
<p>long periods of time on bedrest</p>
<p>or when they&rsquo;ve been chronically ill.</p>
<p>And so here again, we&rsquo;re talking about creating</p>
<p>a positive environment in the gut,</p>
<p>either by adjusting acidity,</p>
<p>maybe you explore the betaine HCl pepsin thing.</p>
<p>I think if you have healthy digestion,</p>
<p>if you feel like you have a good relationship to your gut</p>
<p>and it has a good relationship to you,</p>
<p>sort of a silly phrase because it is you and you are it,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any means</p>
<p>or any need to pursue this.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t, that might be one avenue to pursue.</p>
<p>However, I think primary in all of this</p>
<p>is the fermented food findings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just one study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s many, many findings that now bring us to a place</p>
<p>where a huge center of mass of data</p>
<p>are pointing us in the direction of saying,</p>
<p>ingest fermented foods on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I should also mention that conditions like sarcopenia,</p>
<p>which is the loss of muscle tissue as we age,</p>
<p>has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>So while today is about interoception,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about sensing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also talking about subconscious sensing.</p>
<p>What are we talking about subconscious sensing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about subconscious sensing</p>
<p>of the milieu of the body.</p>
<p>When the milieu of the gut and the body is right,</p>
<p>then the brain and the immune system function very well.</p>
<p>And so this isn&rsquo;t something where you can sit back and say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I feel all those good microbiota in my gut</p>
<p>or, oh no, those are bad microbiota.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that unless you&rsquo;re going to take fecal samples</p>
<p>and blood samples and analyze them</p>
<p>with the extreme exhaustive nature</p>
<p>that the Sonnenberg and other labs do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get that kind of information.</p>
<p>I know there are companies out there that do this</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to knock on any of them,</p>
<p>but I do want to emphasize that to do this right,</p>
<p>to really analyze which cytokines you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>and which ones you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you really need to look at a huge number of them.</p>
<p>And that requires large-scale proteomic and genomic</p>
<p>and inflammatory marker screens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the kind of thing</p>
<p>that most commercial enterprises can really provide</p>
<p>to people in a way that they can interpret.</p>
<p>Rather, this is a case where you can simply go</p>
<p>to the effector, to the thing that can actually move</p>
<p>the needle in the right direction for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fermented foods and that&rsquo;s keeping the stomach</p>
<p>slightly more acid than one might think you would want to.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about barfing first.</p>
<p>Barfing, aka vomiting,</p>
<p>is when the contents of your guts run in reverse,</p>
<p>meaning when they go up from your stomach,</p>
<p>sometimes even up from the intestines,</p>
<p>even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes happens,</p>
<p>up out the esophagus and mouth</p>
<p>and onto whatever surface happens to be in front of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible thing, nobody likes to do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very interesting aspect to our biology</p>
<p>because it reveals a beautiful</p>
<p>and absolutely fundamental relationship</p>
<p>between our chemistry and our brain.</p>
<p>So your brain is actually locked behind a gate</p>
<p>and that gate is not your skull.</p>
<p>That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions,</p>
<p>the things I talked about before</p>
<p>that provide a fence so things can&rsquo;t get through</p>
<p>and get through in leaky gut,</p>
<p>your brain has tight junctions that are very, very tight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely fundamental that only certain molecules</p>
<p>get across the blood-brain barrier and that others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that most all,</p>
<p>99.9999% of your neurons do not regenerate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>especially in the news recently</p>
<p>about how psychedelics cause neurogenesis</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Psychedelics have effects on brain plasticity,</p>
<p>but they have nothing to do with neurogenesis,</p>
<p>at least no data support it.</p>
<p>But because you can&rsquo;t make new neurons,</p>
<p>you also can&rsquo;t damage the ones you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>or you shouldn&rsquo;t as much as possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you have a blood-brain barrier or a BBB.</p>
<p>So the BBB, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>prevents substances from getting to the brain.</p>
<p>However, like any fence,</p>
<p>it is not always uniform along its length.</p>
<p>And there are little spots within that fence</p>
<p>where chemicals can sneak across to the brain.</p>
<p>And through a beautiful design,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the design.</p>
<p>As I always say, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted the design phase.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about any kind of intelligent design</p>
<p>or anything.</p>
<p>That is not the topic of this podcast.</p>
<p>This is not a philosophy podcast,</p>
<p>nor is it a religion podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a science podcast.</p>
<p>But through a beautiful design of some sort,</p>
<p>there are little holes in that fence</p>
<p>and there are little neurons</p>
<p>that sit right behind those holes.</p>
<p>And those neurons sense what the chemistry of the blood is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing you probably didn&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>that today&rsquo;s discussion about sensing the self</p>
<p>would be sensing your own blood, but you do.</p>
<p>There is a little area of your brain that&rsquo;s little indeed,</p>
<p>but is very, very important called area postrema.</p>
<p>P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.</p>
<p>And area postrema is an area of the brainstem</p>
<p>that sits right next to another brain area</p>
<p>called the chemoreceptor trigger zone.</p>
<p>And when the contents in your bloodstream</p>
<p>are of a particular kind,</p>
<p>meaning when there are pathogens or it&rsquo;s too acidic,</p>
<p>the neurons in area postrema</p>
<p>and the neurons in the chemoreceptor trigger zone,</p>
<p>the CTZ as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall</p>
<p>that make you barf, okay?</p>
<p>The feeling that you need to throw up</p>
<p>is triggered by these neurons in the brainstem.</p>
<p>And those neurons in the brainstem are triggered</p>
<p>by the presence of certain chemicals.</p>
<p>And the reason why you don&rsquo;t have any blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>at that location is because postrema has to be there</p>
<p>like a crossing guard,</p>
<p>making sure that everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming through the blood is okay.</p>
<p>And if it even senses just the tiniest bit</p>
<p>that things are off, it&rsquo;s going to trigger that reflex.</p>
<p>Now, the really interesting thing</p>
<p>is that the neurons in area postrema</p>
<p>respond to the chemistry of the blood,</p>
<p>but they also will respond to our consciousness,</p>
<p>to things that we think and things that we believe</p>
<p>and even particular memories.</p>
<p>This is why when certain people see vomit</p>
<p>or see someone else vomit or even somebody else heaving</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re going to vomit,</p>
<p>they themselves feel as if they&rsquo;re going to vomit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing there are probably even a few of you right now</p>
<p>that feel like you might vomit.</p>
<p>You might feel salivation in your throat,</p>
<p>which is always a precursor to vomiting.</p>
<p>Some people, the memory of,</p>
<p>or the thought of something like blood or vomit,</p>
<p>or use your imagination,</p>
<p>can actually trigger the vomit reflex.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because these neurons in area postrema</p>
<p>are very sensitive to prior experience</p>
<p>of interactions with negative things.</p>
<p>So, and actually, as I&rsquo;m saying this,</p>
<p>I feel my gut kind of cramping up again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t vomit very easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of those,</p>
<p>nor am I somebody who&rsquo;s never vomited.</p>
<p>And here we are talking about my vomit history,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s appropriate in this context.</p>
<p>The neurons of area postrema</p>
<p>are there basically to keep your whole system safe.</p>
<p>And thank goodness they are,</p>
<p>because for instance, some people,</p>
<p>unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol</p>
<p>that they throw up.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why that is?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because alcohol fundamentally is a poison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying for age appropriate folks</p>
<p>that ingesting alcohol is bad.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a judgment call,</p>
<p>but alcohol itself at excessive levels in the bloodstream</p>
<p>triggers postrema to cause vomiting.</p>
<p>So this is an example whereby memories,</p>
<p>context, but also just the chemistry of our internal state</p>
<p>is triggering behaviors that are very hardwired.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very reflex driven.</p>
<p>And why would it be that some people</p>
<p>get more nauseous than others at a given level?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;ll have to do with alcohol tolerance.</p>
<p>Some people have what&rsquo;s called a,</p>
<p>we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel.</p>
<p>Other people, they throw up very easily</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t feel well,</p>
<p>or if they ingest anything that&rsquo;s just a little bit off.</p>
<p>From a purely adaptive standpoint,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably better to vomit up things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t good for you,</p>
<p>rather than to pass through,</p>
<p>have them pass through your system,</p>
<p>especially if those things are contained in lipids.</p>
<p>For instance, if you ingest something that&rsquo;s in lipid form,</p>
<p>because cells, literally every cell in your body</p>
<p>is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty tissue.</p>
<p>I would call it the bilayer membrane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little membrane.</p>
<p>Fat can move through fat very easily.</p>
<p>And so any bad stuff you ingest</p>
<p>can get stuck in your system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk for a second about how to reduce nausea,</p>
<p>because nausea, that salivation,</p>
<p>that feeling that you&rsquo;re going to vomit</p>
<p>can be very beneficial in an adaptive circumstance,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve ingested something bad,</p>
<p>but some people experience nausea for other reasons.</p>
<p>There are good ways to regulate nausea.</p>
<p>And the ways they regulate nausea are very interesting.</p>
<p>They actually adjust the activity</p>
<p>of these neurons in areopustrema,</p>
<p>or they change the chemistry of the blood directly.</p>
<p>And many of you have heard this before perhaps,</p>
<p>but it turns out that there are good data.</p>
<p>11 research studies were the ones that I could find,</p>
<p>peer-reviewed research studies with no bias.</p>
<p>So independent studies showing that ginger</p>
<p>can cause a notable reduction in nausea.</p>
<p>How much ginger?</p>
<p>One to three grams.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one to three grams?</p>
<p>Well, you have to measure it out on a scale</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re taking it in pill or capsule form.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter</p>
<p>if you take it in pill or capsule form.</p>
<p>So this thing that you&rsquo;ve heard before,</p>
<p>that ginger can reduce nausea, indeed is true.</p>
<p>Peppermint apparently can also do that.</p>
<p>And some of you will not be surprised to learn</p>
<p>that cannabis can reduce nausea.</p>
<p>Not surprised because cannabis,</p>
<p>which has different legality in different places,</p>
<p>and I understand that,</p>
<p>so please take that into consideration.</p>
<p>But cannabis, THC, and, or it turns out CBD,</p>
<p>can reduce nausea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown in at least one study.</p>
<p>And it probably does that,</p>
<p>not by changing the chemistry of your blood,</p>
<p>but by changing the threshold for firing</p>
<p>of these neurons in areopostrema.</p>
<p>And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy,</p>
<p>radiation therapy, and others,</p>
<p>where people are feeling very nauseous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending people go use cannabis</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;ve decided with their selves</p>
<p>and their family and their doctor that they should.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is this thing about CBD,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do a whole episode on THC and CBD.</p>
<p>CBD doesn&rsquo;t have, or isn&rsquo;t supposed to have,</p>
<p>these psychoactive properties that THC does,</p>
<p>although CBD can have a mild to major anxiolytic,</p>
<p>anxiety-reducing effect.</p>
<p>But it does appear that the data are,</p>
<p>what the data support, I should say,</p>
<p>the anecdotal reports,</p>
<p>which are that cannabis can reduce nausea.</p>
<p>So to barf less, ginger, peppermint,</p>
<p>and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about fever.</p>
<p>In previous episodes and in future episodes,</p>
<p>we deal with thermal regulation,</p>
<p>which is the body&rsquo;s ability to regulate its temperature.</p>
<p>Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths</p>
<p>and physical performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to deal with all that right now,</p>
<p>but I promise we will going forward.</p>
<p>Today, I only want to talk about fever</p>
<p>because fever directly relates to interoception.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature.</p>
<p>That increase in body temperature</p>
<p>is triggered by neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>And those neurons in the brain are triggered</p>
<p>by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>What sorts of things?</p>
<p>Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses.</p>
<p>When something bad gets in our system,</p>
<p>the body doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It just knows it&rsquo;s foreign and it hasn&rsquo;t seen it before,</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s in the wrong compartment of the body.</p>
<p>So earlier, we were talking about proteins</p>
<p>that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a piece of steak sitting in your bicep.</p>
<p>That would be bad.</p>
<p>You would actually develop antibodies.</p>
<p>You would have a horrible infection.</p>
<p>But your body has this intelligence.</p>
<p>And that intelligence is to know,</p>
<p>hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region.</p>
<p>And then your body or the cells there,</p>
<p>I should say, will release something</p>
<p>that then will travel to the brain</p>
<p>and will trigger an increase in body temperature</p>
<p>so that your body cooks the bad thing</p>
<p>or the cause of the bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a beautiful adaptive mechanism.</p>
<p>We always think fever is so terrible,</p>
<p>but fever is there to cook the bad thing that&rsquo;s inside you</p>
<p>or that has left the correct compartment inside you</p>
<p>and is in the wrong compartment inside you.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s beautiful about the fever mechanism</p>
<p>is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism.</p>
<p>Basically, you have a set of neurons</p>
<p>that sit near the ventricles.</p>
<p>Remember, the ventricles is this hole in the tube</p>
<p>that is you, the tube that is you.</p>
<p>You are a tube, a series of tubes,</p>
<p>and your brain has a hole down the middle</p>
<p>and it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord.</p>
<p>At the front, it&rsquo;s called the ventricles.</p>
<p>They start with what are called the lateral ventricles</p>
<p>and the, excuse me,</p>
<p>starts with the third and the lateral ventricles.</p>
<p>And then it goes to the fourth ventricle</p>
<p>and then to what&rsquo;s called the central canal.</p>
<p>But basically, it&rsquo;s just a big space</p>
<p>in the middle of your nervous system,</p>
<p>the middle of your brain.</p>
<p>And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned</p>
<p>called the third ventricle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s shaped kind of like a thin oval upright.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this, just think an eye,</p>
<p>just think the shape of an eye,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up and down as opposed to across.</p>
<p>And along that third ventricle,</p>
<p>there are little neurons that can sense</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in the cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>that fills the ventricle.</p>
<p>So in other words, you have neurons</p>
<p>that are sensing the chemistry</p>
<p>of your cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>and that have access therefore</p>
<p>to the chemistry of your body</p>
<p>because that cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>is going up and down the brain and spinal cord,</p>
<p>but into that cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>are signals about the various chemicals within the body.</p>
<p>So this is not a mechanical system,</p>
<p>this is a chemical system.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re talking about mechanical information</p>
<p>and chemical information accessing the brain.</p>
<p>So if you have something bad in your system,</p>
<p>you breathed in a virus,</p>
<p>or you inhaled some bacteria,</p>
<p>or you got a cut on your leg</p>
<p>and some bacteria are growing there,</p>
<p>of course, locally there will be effects.</p>
<p>Little things called mast cells, M-A-S-T,</p>
<p>little packets of histamine,</p>
<p>literally will go there and explode</p>
<p>and cause inflammation,</p>
<p>which is actually a good inflammation</p>
<p>and will release little things called macrophages</p>
<p>to try to gobble up the infection.</p>
<p>The other day, I was in Texas,</p>
<p>there was a mean little mosquitoes in Texas</p>
<p>and a lot of them,</p>
<p>and I would stand outside and I&rsquo;d get bitten.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel a thing,</p>
<p>but then later that night,</p>
<p>they started swelling up and itching,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d itch them and then they&rsquo;d swell even more.</p>
<p>That was because of the release of mast cells,</p>
<p>of histamines inside those mast cells</p>
<p>that were literally causing inflammation of the tissue.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the poison from the mosquito itself,</p>
<p>it was the immune response to those.</p>
<p>Well, you also have this systemic</p>
<p>or body-wide attempt to kill stuff,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the fever.</p>
<p>So the neurons that line these ventricles</p>
<p>with cerebral spinal fluid go by a particular name.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called circumventricular organs,</p>
<p>meaning near, circumventricular, near the ventricles.</p>
<p>And you have these organs,</p>
<p>and there are a set of neurons</p>
<p>that has a really cool name called the OVLT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I like that,</p>
<p>but I just like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis.</p>
<p>Organum vasculosum lateral terminalis, OVLT,</p>
<p>are the neurons that respond to toxins</p>
<p>and bad stuff in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>however minor or major,</p>
<p>and they release things like ILK1,</p>
<p>which are inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Inflammatory, in this case, is good.</p>
<p>You want inflammation at the site of an infection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to help with healing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to change the conditions in your body.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen is</p>
<p>when those OVLT neurons are activated,</p>
<p>because you have something bad in your body</p>
<p>or something bad is happening in your body,</p>
<p>they communicate with an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature</p>
<p>and tries to cook that bad thing.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s worth talking about fever for a moment</p>
<p>and talking about thermal regulation,</p>
<p>because I think this actually could save some lives.</p>
<p>So if you are overheated to a point where, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting up past 102 or 103,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to vary depending on person to person</p>
<p>and certainly age.</p>
<p>You know, kids, some people think,</p>
<p>can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults,</p>
<p>but look, you always want to be cautious</p>
<p>about heating up the brain too much,</p>
<p>because once those neurons are gone,</p>
<p>they do not come back,</p>
<p>and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures.</p>
<p>Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103,</p>
<p>certainly 104, you are starting to enter</p>
<p>serious danger zone.</p>
<p>This can happen through exercise in hot environments</p>
<p>or an inability to escape heat,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have covering</p>
<p>or adequate ventilation or cooling.</p>
<p>It can also be because of excessive fever</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>A lot of people think the way to deal with this</p>
<p>is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck</p>
<p>or to cool the torso.</p>
<p>In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on the undergraduate side of the campus as well,</p>
<p>runs a biology lab.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a world expert in thermal regulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that that&rsquo;s the wrong response</p>
<p>to try and cool off the body.</p>
<p>If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack</p>
<p>on the back of the neck,</p>
<p>what you effectively do is cool the blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to the brain.</p>
<p>And if you do that, then your brain will react</p>
<p>by turning up the crank in, so to speak,</p>
<p>on the neurons in the preoptic area</p>
<p>and will heat you up further</p>
<p>and can cook your brain and organs further.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is, as I&rsquo;ve talked about before,</p>
<p>you want to cool the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>the palms of the hands, and the upper part of the face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into all the details</p>
<p>as to why you want to do that right now,</p>
<p>but those are the locations you want to cool.</p>
<p>Now, you can also cool the rest of the body,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not okay to just stay under the covers</p>
<p>and just cool the neck or something like that.</p>
<p>You really want to try and create a systemic</p>
<p>or whole body cooling if the goal is to bring fever down.</p>
<p>But in many cases, fever is adaptive.</p>
<p>And so taking non-steroid inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s recommended,</p>
<p>but other times, because it reduces your fever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s allowing that pathogen,</p>
<p>that pyrogen, it&rsquo;s sometimes called.</p>
<p>A pyrogen is a substance that causes fever.</p>
<p>Think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro.</p>
<p>Those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t survive at high temperatures.</p>
<p>So the fever is an adaptive mechanism</p>
<p>and the OVLT and the sensing of your chemistry</p>
<p>is how the OVLT, organovasculosome</p>
<p>and the lateral terminalis does that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about sensing lung volume,</p>
<p>speed of our heartbeat.</p>
<p>We talked about sensing the gut volume,</p>
<p>the intestinal volume, or the absence of volume.</p>
<p>We talked about chemistry of the gut</p>
<p>and the gut microbiota and autoimmune functions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now talked about vomiting</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about fever.</p>
<p>Lots of aspects of sensing our internal self.</p>
<p>Now I want to turn our attention to interoception</p>
<p>as it relates to feelings,</p>
<p>the way that interoception is most commonly described.</p>
<p>And I want to highlight a term</p>
<p>that many of you have probably heard,</p>
<p>which is the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>We talked about vagus a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding, wandering nerve</p>
<p>is involved in everything I&rsquo;ve talked about up until now.</p>
<p>And the reason I saved it till now,</p>
<p>rather than mentioning it all along,</p>
<p>is to highlight a specific point,</p>
<p>which is that whenever we hear about the vagus</p>
<p>in popular culture, it&rsquo;s like the vagus calms you down.</p>
<p>You want to stimulate the vagus</p>
<p>by rubbing in front of the ear.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a parasympathetic nerve</p>
<p>and it will calm you down, it&rsquo;ll mellow you out.</p>
<p>Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory.</p>
<p>When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars,</p>
<p>or fatty acids, the vagus nerve gets activated</p>
<p>and triggers the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>It makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods</p>
<p>or what led to those conditions.</p>
<p>When you feel nauseous, it&rsquo;s rarely calming.</p>
<p>When you feel like you have a fever, it&rsquo;s rarely calming.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re starting to get the picture</p>
<p>that even though the vagus nerve</p>
<p>is in the parasympathetic branch</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>and if that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not an aficionado, don&rsquo;t worry about it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a calming system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a communication system and it&rsquo;s a motor system.</p>
<p>It communicates brain to body and body to brain</p>
<p>and it changes the function of different organs.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that&rsquo;s important to highlight</p>
<p>is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut</p>
<p>because of the ways that it shuts down the vagus nerve</p>
<p>and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain.</p>
<p>I want to say that again.</p>
<p>Stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good,</p>
<p>poor digestion, and just lousy</p>
<p>because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve</p>
<p>and the neurons of your gut.</p>
<p>So what stress does is it blocks the communication</p>
<p>between gut and brain.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mess up your gut.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t let your gut get the signals</p>
<p>up to your brain.</p>
<p>And it also then throws off the chemistry</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a whole cascade of effects.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about stress,</p>
<p>I did a whole episode called Master Stress,</p>
<p>or I think maybe it was called Conquer Stress.</p>
<p>I think it was Master Stress.</p>
<p>Either one, the whole point of that episode</p>
<p>is to give you tools and practices</p>
<p>to deal with short-term acute stress,</p>
<p>moderate term stress, and long-term chronic stress</p>
<p>through behavioral mechanisms, nutrition,</p>
<p>supplementation, and many other things as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chock-a-block full of protocols and tools for stress.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion.</p>
<p>And the way it does that is to pool,</p>
<p>to aggregate the conditions of your gut,</p>
<p>the conditions of your heart,</p>
<p>and the conditions of your breathing,</p>
<p>which includes your diaphragm and lungs,</p>
<p>and takes that kind of as a collection of information</p>
<p>and sends it to the brain</p>
<p>and controls what we call your emotions.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem obvious to some people,</p>
<p>but to other people, that might seem totally crazy.</p>
<p>You thought your emotions were because the market was down</p>
<p>and you had invested,</p>
<p>or because something that you thought was going to happen</p>
<p>is not going to happen,</p>
<p>or because you thought that school was going to open</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>or maybe you thought it wasn&rsquo;t and it is.</p>
<p>Whatever it is that bothers you,</p>
<p>you think of generally as a purely cognitive event.</p>
<p>But the brain doesn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what to do with that information.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t act directly on that information to create moods.</p>
<p>Moods are created through the heart&rsquo;s response</p>
<p>to reading that headline,</p>
<p>to the change in your breathing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caused by someone that you love telling you</p>
<p>that actually they&rsquo;re not interested</p>
<p>in spending time with you anymore, or that you screwed up,</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;re interested in spending</p>
<p>a lot of time with you.</p>
<p>And you like that, right?</p>
<p>Emotions can be good or bad or neutral.</p>
<p>So this thing that we call interoception,</p>
<p>the sense of self,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been building up from very fundamental layers,</p>
<p>gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, autoimmune.</p>
<p>And you might&rsquo;ve been thinking,</p>
<p>wait, I thought this was going to be about a sense of self,</p>
<p>a noticing or a feeling.</p>
<p>And indeed, all of those things are plugging in</p>
<p>like a series of ingredients in a recipe</p>
<p>that gives rise to your mood and how you feel.</p>
<p>And that mood and how you feel</p>
<p>is shown in one location in your body</p>
<p>that other people can see,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in your facial expressions.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are now beautiful data</p>
<p>showing that your face,</p>
<p>including the size of your pupils,</p>
<p>the tonality of your face,</p>
<p>how flushed you are or how pale you are,</p>
<p>even the degree to which you are frowning or smiling</p>
<p>relative to other periods of time,</p>
<p>that is all an aggregate of,</p>
<p>or a reflection rather of your gut, your heart,</p>
<p>and your breathing and the chemistry of your body.</p>
<p>And so this is why I sort of backed into this conversation</p>
<p>about interoception.</p>
<p>I kind of Trojan horse this on you on purpose,</p>
<p>which is that when we talk about the vagus and you hear,</p>
<p>oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing</p>
<p>or rubbing on the front of the ear,</p>
<p>sure, that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>But another fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut,</p>
<p>how fast you&rsquo;re breathing.</p>
<p>Are you inhale-emphasized or exhale-emphasized breathing?</p>
<p>When we are relaxed, our pupils tend to constrict.</p>
<p>When we are very alert, our pupils tend to be dilated,</p>
<p>whether or not that alertness has to do</p>
<p>with being happy or being sad.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable,</p>
<p>and this is where interoception really, really</p>
<p>takes a leap into the incredible,</p>
<p>is that there are beautiful studies that show</p>
<p>that for instance, when we know somebody pretty well</p>
<p>and they are going through some sort of experience</p>
<p>of any kind,</p>
<p>our heart rate actually starts to mimic their heart rate.</p>
<p>Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing,</p>
<p>even if we aren&rsquo;t conscious of their breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we see their chest heaving,</p>
<p>and we think, oh my goodness, and then we breathe that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mirroring,</p>
<p>and no, it&rsquo;s not carried out through mirror neurons.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons are more of a myth than a reality,</p>
<p>sorry to burst people&rsquo;s bubbles,</p>
<p>but that bubble around mirror neurons</p>
<p>is definitely made of myths,</p>
<p>and a topic for another time, but we start to mirror.</p>
<p>Somehow human beings are able to register</p>
<p>the internal state of other beings,</p>
<p>and I think probably for animals too,</p>
<p>but certainly for other humans, even at a distance,</p>
<p>and these studies are many now,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really wonderful studies,</p>
<p>and so your sense of your internal landscape</p>
<p>is linked to others.</p>
<p>Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity</p>
<p>for how you feel and how others feel.</p>
<p>In other words, you can start getting a better readout</p>
<p>of your internal state by doing a simple exercise,</p>
<p>what is really a tool,</p>
<p>and that is to learn to sense your heartbeats.</p>
<p>So some people are very good at this, other people are not.</p>
<p>Some people can do this more easily</p>
<p>when they have all their air exhaled,</p>
<p>and some people can do it better</p>
<p>when they are holding a breath hold,</p>
<p>but one thing that&rsquo;s kind of cool</p>
<p>about this whole interoceptive capacity</p>
<p>is that you can enhance it very, very quickly.</p>
<p>You can learn or teach yourself</p>
<p>to have heightened levels of interoception</p>
<p>in a way that you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>just give yourself heightened levels of vision</p>
<p>by snapping your fingers</p>
<p>in one round of one tool or exercise.</p>
<p>There are things you can do to improve vision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the topic of a previous episode.</p>
<p>I encourage you to look it up.</p>
<p>There are things you can do to improve your hearing</p>
<p>and your taste and your smell.</p>
<p>We talked about all those,</p>
<p>but within interoception,</p>
<p>you can get very good at this very fast,</p>
<p>and I think this is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why meditation is powerful.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why meditation is powerful,</p>
<p>but one of the reasons is</p>
<p>when you stop taking in exteroceptive information,</p>
<p>information from the outside world</p>
<p>by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say,</p>
<p>you start paying attention to your breathing cadence.</p>
<p>You start directing your mind&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>to your heart rate,</p>
<p>and if you can start to perceive your heart beating,</p>
<p>you actually are very quickly strengthen</p>
<p>the vagal connections between the body and the brain,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s no real practice here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no breathe this way or do this thing</p>
<p>except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat.</p>
<p>And some people can get very good at this very fast.</p>
<p>Most people find that just by doing this</p>
<p>for a minute or so every once in a while,</p>
<p>they start to tap into this sixth sense.</p>
<p>They start to notice when they don&rsquo;t feel quite right</p>
<p>about something or somebody or some situation,</p>
<p>or they start to notice when they feel quite right</p>
<p>about somebody or something or some situation.</p>
<p>So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up.</p>
<p>It used to be called vagal tone,</p>
<p>but I think that term doesn&rsquo;t take into account</p>
<p>all the other things that are going on with the vagus,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t really like that term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of an interoceptive awareness.</p>
<p>And again, there are many studies now showing</p>
<p>that for sake of bettering one&rsquo;s mood overall,</p>
<p>for sake of moving through a challenging phase in life,</p>
<p>for sake of just enhancing one&rsquo;s experience of life overall,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the taste of foods,</p>
<p>interactions with other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure,</p>
<p>tuning up one&rsquo;s interoceptive awareness is both easy,</p>
<p>again, by just taking a minute or two</p>
<p>and trying to count heartbeats.</p>
<p>And then this works best, of course,</p>
<p>if you have some independent readout of heartbeats</p>
<p>and you can compare, you can see how accurate you are.</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t use a device</p>
<p>or have a device to do that,</p>
<p>without taking your pulse,</p>
<p>using your thumb on your wrist or something,</p>
<p>or your fingers on your neck,</p>
<p>as you typically would for taking your pulse,</p>
<p>trying to sit still for a minute or two</p>
<p>every once in a while, maybe once a week,</p>
<p>maybe twice a week, maybe while you&rsquo;re meditating,</p>
<p>maybe while breath work,</p>
<p>maybe during the breath holds or breath work,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really have to do this</p>
<p>in any kind of extended way.</p>
<p>You can very quickly increase your interoceptive tone.</p>
<p>And that has a huge and outsized effect</p>
<p>on the brain-body relationship</p>
<p>and your brain&rsquo;s ability to tap into</p>
<p>both the subconscious and the conscious aspects</p>
<p>of this chemical and mechanical signaling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening all the time.</p>
<p>And it can have real and outsized positive effects</p>
<p>on your ability to engage with other people</p>
<p>and your ability to focus at work</p>
<p>and your ability to notice,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;m finding myself kind of feeling</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m losing focus,</p>
<p>but really it was my heart rate was just increasing.</p>
<p>Maybe I just exhale a little bit</p>
<p>and bring my heart rate down.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve effectively tried to do today</p>
<p>is to give you a window into this incredible relationship</p>
<p>between your viscera and your brain</p>
<p>and your brain and your viscera,</p>
<p>all these organs of your body.</p>
<p>And what I hope is that you&rsquo;ll appreciate</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a system, that you aren&rsquo;t just a system of tubes.</p>
<p>I said that in sort of in jest.</p>
<p>I mean, you have a lot of tubes</p>
<p>and you are a system of tubes,</p>
<p>but that system of tubes is linked</p>
<p>through the nervous system.</p>
<p>And those links work in very specific ways.</p>
<p>So whether or not you remember about piezos</p>
<p>and all the GLP-1Rs and all that stuff,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>What I encourage you to do is start sort of pushing</p>
<p>and pulling on the various levers</p>
<p>within this beautiful system</p>
<p>that we call the interoceptive system,</p>
<p>this sense of self.</p>
