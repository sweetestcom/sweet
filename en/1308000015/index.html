    <p>Okay, besties are back. Besties are back going around the horn. Rain Man David Sacks calling</p>
<p>in from an undisclosed location, suffering through two code 13s in one lifetime.</p>
<p>And David Friedberg is here, the queen of quinoa, spacking everything in sight,</p>
<p>living the life, calling in from a nondescript Ritz-Carlton room, it appears to be.</p>
<p>And of course, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, cackling like a fool.</p>
<p>Welcome back, everybody. This is what you pay for with your subscription to the All In podcast,</p>
<p>brought to you by Slack. If you didn&rsquo;t own Slack shares, raise your hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an incredible week on a number of levels. We&rsquo;re going to talk this week about</p>
<p>Salesforce buying Slack, Trump and Section 230, the ongoing Coinbase saga.</p>
<p>Friedberg found some interesting science that could save humanity. And of course,</p>
<p>the trust fund socialists in the New York Times who hate their parents for giving them money.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with the most important thing. What is that shirt, undershirt combo you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wearing? I mean, look, you have buttons on buttons.</p>
<p>Did I break the layering rule?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re going to layer properly, you can have only one layer of buttons,</p>
<p>but to have two layers of buttons-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works?</p>
<p>J. Cal went in and got-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Layers are for players, not me.</p>
<p>No, he got like an almond milk cappuccino. And he&rsquo;s like, I like how that barista dress is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to wear that from now on.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Can I ask a technical question? Can I have buttons? I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have buttons on buttons, but can I have buttons and then a zipper up like with the-</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t do that either. Listen-</p>
<p>Chamath has had a weird aversion to buttons ever since he spent that time in Italy.</p>
<p>Was he button shamed in Italy?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t. I was a little button shamed, but I&rsquo;m looking at Sax has buttons on his collars,</p>
<p>which just makes no sense. Sax is wearing the same Brooks Brothers shirt that he graduated</p>
<p>high school in. At Brooks, he owns 17% of Brooks Brothers at this point from the number of</p>
<p>lasers he&rsquo;s bought there. All right, let&rsquo;s get off to it. We&rsquo;ve insulted each other.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Freeberg&rsquo;s taken the brunt of anything yet. Anybody have any</p>
<p>chop busting they want to do with Freeberg or is that just sort of built in?</p>
<p>No, Freeberg took the tablecloth that I use for a picnic in the summertime</p>
<p>and made it into a shirt. There it is.</p>
<p>You know, you have to be frugal at this time. And also,</p>
<p>Freeberg cares about the environment. He&rsquo;s not going to just let a picnic-</p>
<p>What was it? A blanket go to waste?</p>
<p>It was a hemp based tablecloth. And so I knew it was going to get taken and stolen.</p>
<p>I love how I choose to spend my time with you guys.</p>
<p>It just pays off. Here we go. All right. Can we kick this off?</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s kick it off with our advertisement for</p>
<p>nobody because Chamath will not let me make any money off of this podcast.</p>
<p>And thanks again for the suggestion that we launch a syndicate with no carry.</p>
<p>Now a bunch of dipshits on Twitter are like, hey, when is the all in syndicate starting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, never. I need to make a living. I need to get my beak wet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I think an all in syndicate would be super, super disruptive and cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally fine with running it as long as we can have the 20% carry</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll manage the whole thing. We got four people on the call.</p>
<p>We each get 5% carry, but we got to make a living here.</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s made it, Chamath. Not everybody&rsquo;s got SPACs A through Z</p>
<p>or had all of their Slack shares bought. I think we&rsquo;ll kick it off with that.</p>
<p>Chamath, we saw this week, in fact, just two days ago, Salesforce in a record transaction</p>
<p>for a SaaS company. I think it&rsquo;s the highest ever paid for a SaaS company, $27 billion,</p>
<p>$27.7 billion for Slack, which has only been public for just over a year, I think.</p>
<p>I think did the Series B in Slack right after they did the pivot at Social Capital. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if that was in 5.1 or 2, but Phil Helmuth keeps talking about it.</p>
<p>It was the Series B in TinySpec, but it was the Series A in Slack.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really important story, which is that myself and Ray Ko, who&rsquo;s my partner at</p>
<p>Social Capital, we&rsquo;ve worked together now for, my gosh, I think it&rsquo;s probably 15 years,</p>
<p>wrote a really great memo justifying the investment in Slack. It had to do with one</p>
<p>thing and one thing only. We ignored the revenue and ARR. I mean, it was fine and nice and good,</p>
<p>but the single biggest thing that we were attracted to was something that we</p>
<p>looked at and which was called intercompany edges.</p>
<p>And even back in 2015 or 16 when we did this original investment, there was this dynamic</p>
<p>where people across companies were communicating via Slack channels. I was completely stunned by</p>
<p>this idea because that was effectively a substitution for email because the only way</p>
<p>you communicate across companies today is by email. David is at craftventures.com and he</p>
<p>emails me at socialcapital.com and I email Jason at inside.com. That&rsquo;s how we communicate across</p>
<p>businesses, except now all of a sudden you could be messaging and having a much more real-time</p>
<p>interface. That to me was incredibly disruptive and it justified the entirety of the real forward</p>
<p>looking investment thesis. Now fast forward five years later and these guys have more usage on a</p>
<p>daily basis than Facebook, which is stunning because these guys have 10 million DAUs and</p>
<p>Facebook has 2 billion. So it just goes to show you the quantity of traffic and the volume of</p>
<p>information and theoretically productivity that&rsquo;s happening on Slack. And so I&rsquo;m not sure what</p>
<p>Salesforce bought. I actually think that you can make a case why it&rsquo;s a shame that it got bought,</p>
<p>a very strong one in fact, but what they did get, whether they know it or not,</p>
<p>is an intercompany edge effect, which is the most disruptive thing to email.</p>
<p>And in the hands of Salesforce and that sales team, I think it has the ability to really</p>
<p>be a very disruptive force for good in enterprise software.</p>
<p>All right. So Sax, this is a natural passing of the ball to you and the baton because you did</p>
<p>Yammer, sold it to Microsoft for a billion dollars. And obviously Slack was the mobile successor to</p>
<p>the desktop version of Yammer and you got a lot of your fingerprints all over this.</p>
<p>But the fact is you did a tweet storm about it. Slack is an unbelievable success. Stuart is a</p>
<p>great founder. He sold his first company Flickr for 30 million, this one for almost 30 billion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty nice. But there was one failure and you pointed out in your tweet storm,</p>
<p>explain what the one failure, if you could pick out of the hundreds of things, thousands of things</p>
<p>they did right, there was one thing they did wrong that to Chamath&rsquo;s point would have resulted</p>
<p>in them remaining an independent company that could have become worth more than 27 billion.</p>
<p>Yeah. It was a slowness to embrace the idea of enterprise sales. And by the way, let&rsquo;s put this</p>
<p>in context. I mean, Stuart and the Slack team did a phenomenal job, $30 billion exit, seven years of</p>
<p>just about flawless execution. And also, I was an investor in the company, so thank you to Stuart</p>
<p>for letting me invest. I definitely don&rsquo;t want to sound like an ingrate or a critic. I mean,</p>
<p>they did a phenomenal job. But if you were to nitpick just one little thing that I think they</p>
<p>could have done faster, it would have been embracing enterprise sales. The big learning</p>
<p>from Yammer, we learned this at Yammer from 2008 to 2012, is that enterprises don&rsquo;t self-serve,</p>
<p>right? They don&rsquo;t self-close. Bottom up, SaaS products are phenomenal for generating top of</p>
<p>funnel, basically generating leads, but you have to have salespeople close the deals and</p>
<p>enterprises don&rsquo;t just kind of pull out a credit card and self-serve, they need a salesperson.</p>
<p>And I think there was something in the DNA of Slack that actually I see really very commonly</p>
<p>in the DNA of sort of product-y SaaS companies, product-y SaaS founders, which is they kind of</p>
<p>have a reflexive dislike or distaste for sales, and they resist the idea of sales and they want</p>
<p>to believe that they can just be entirely product-driven. And what I see across the board</p>
<p>is they all come to the same realization that we had at Yammer, which is we have to have a</p>
<p>sales team. And I do remember back in 2014, the whole Yammer sales team was basically rolling off</p>
<p>because of Microsoft acquired the company in 2012 and there was an integration period.</p>
<p>And by 2013, 2014, they were all looking for jobs. And I remember my former CRO,</p>
<p>I think, was interviewing at Slack and it would have been such a perfect thing for them</p>
<p>because he had just learned all the lessons of how you layer on kind of an enterprise sale on</p>
<p>top of a bottom-up product. And they just weren&rsquo;t ready to make that hire yet. And so, look,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to nitpick, look, $30 billion outcome, no one&rsquo;s criticizing, but if you were</p>
<p>to nitpick, it&rsquo;s an A-plus regardless, but this would be the one thing you could say.</p>
<p>Well, congratulations all around to everybody involved, especially Phil Helmuth, who was an</p>
<p>LP in one of Chamath&rsquo;s funds. So, if you need insights on Slack or any of the inside information,</p>
<p>you can just follow Phil Helmuth on Twitter at being the greatest or I am the greatest,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll always be the greatest. One of those Twitter handles is his.</p>
<p>But Jason, I mean, you basically came to the same conclusion in your emergency pod, right? I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>I did. I hadn&rsquo;t seen your&hellip; I think a tweet came after the emergency pod, but</p>
<p>yeah, it just seemed to me this company, unlike Zoom, should have been able to grow quicker. And</p>
<p>if you look at their numbers, they had 87 companies that were spending over a million dollars.</p>
<p>You put a rabid sales team on that product and they go in like Benioff does with his sales team.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just hyper-aggressive at just putting huge numbers out there and saying,</p>
<p>you have to pay us this much money. So much so that I don&rsquo;t know if you remember Elon getting</p>
<p>into a public spat with him where he&rsquo;s like, Salesforce is horrible software, get it out of</p>
<p>the organization. He basically banned it because they came to him with the bottom-up people using</p>
<p>of Salesforce and said, hey, you owe us this amount of money. And Elon was like, F you,</p>
<p>banned forever from inside of our organization. We&rsquo;ll build our own software. We don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t have somebody and Stewart didn&rsquo;t have that DNA, I think, to say aggressively,</p>
<p>we need to charge what this product is worth. And you saw that in, I think, one of their strengths</p>
<p>and weaknesses, which was they only build you for people who were actively using the product. Now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful, awesome feature. It makes you not scared to use it. But on the enterprise level,</p>
<p>I mean, that seemed to be like maybe one of those non-cutthroat things that maybe</p>
<p>were holding them back. David, do you have any insights on this or should we go on to AlphaFold?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to remember the mechanics and the game theory around M&amp;A, especially</p>
<p>big game hunting when you&rsquo;re doing $30 billion acquisitions. It&rsquo;s also kind of true at billion</p>
<p>dollar levels, but less so. But the bigger the acquisition gets, you have to remember that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers. And the question is,</p>
<p>who does the asymmetry favor? Because you could look at this acquisition and say, wow, Salesforce</p>
<p>is crazy for spending $30 billion. And somebody else may say, wow, Slack was really stupid for</p>
<p>selling it for $30 billion, right? The reality is that I think that there was asymmetries on both</p>
<p>sides. I think that what Slack probably saw, and I don&rsquo;t know because I&rsquo;ve been off the board now</p>
<p>for more than a year, but I think what they saw was, as David said, just a level of sophistication</p>
<p>and scale and ability to cross sell and upsell that was needed for enterprise scale. Either you</p>
<p>overcome it with precision and speed, or you overcome it by going the same pace as somebody</p>
<p>like Microsoft, but with an equivalent product portfolio. So, that&rsquo;s sort of one realization</p>
<p>that Slack had. But in the case of Salesforce, what they probably had was a realization that</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t go wall to wall inside of a customer because they didn&rsquo;t really have a product</p>
<p>that was useful or usable to every single individual inside of an enterprise.</p>
<p>And so, both of those two things create asymmetries. There&rsquo;s a level of fear inside</p>
<p>of Slack, and there&rsquo;s a level of fear inside of Salesforce. Both of them are about the fear of</p>
<p>disruption. And then the question is, who gets the better of the other person in the middle of the</p>
<p>acquisition, right? So, the deal could have probably gotten done at $22 billion. It probably</p>
<p>could have also gotten done at $45 billion. And that&rsquo;s, again, to a combination of how well you</p>
<p>play poker in that moment, right? Who blinks first and the quality of the bankers.</p>
<p>This is like two people having top pair on a very textured board.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just raising versus each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s who outplays them. Because it&rsquo;s similar also to how Microsoft bought LinkedIn,</p>
<p>right? Because if you think about what happened in LinkedIn, if you remember when that happened,</p>
<p>it was almost to a T very much like Slack. LinkedIn had a one bad quarter.</p>
<p>They got decapitated by&hellip; And I owned it at the time in our public fund. It got decapitated by</p>
<p>like 50%, 60%, 70%. I mean, something insane for missing numbers by a few pennies, okay?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, it took a lot of the wind out of their sales internally. It didn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>the user momentum at all. Because the users that were signing up for LinkedIn didn&rsquo;t care what the</p>
<p>stock price was yesterday, today, and tomorrow. But it all of a sudden created a fear. And I</p>
<p>think Microsoft was able to exploit that fear. And within a year, this company was bought for</p>
<p>$25 billion. Not dissimilar, Slack had a hiccup, and they got rerated, the stock bounced back.</p>
<p>But I think that if Salesforce was smart, they probably created sort of like a white knight</p>
<p>kind of bid that said, listen, you need enterprise scale and the ability to cross sell and upsell</p>
<p>give it to you. And Slack probably said, listen, you need to go wall to wall. So I understand why</p>
<p>you need me. And you know, the price is what the price is. If you look at the pricing, right? So</p>
<p>Slack, normally the way these big M&amp;A, you know, public company M&amp;A deals get done, is the board</p>
<p>has to approve the price. And they have to say this was the right deal for us relative to other</p>
<p>options. And one of the ways you assess that is you look at where the share price has been</p>
<p>historically. And if you&rsquo;re getting a premium to where the share price has been historically,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 30 40% higher than it&rsquo;s ever been, then the board says, great, that&rsquo;s a good deal,</p>
<p>we should take it because we&rsquo;ve got a long way to grow into that value. In this case,</p>
<p>the deal was done not at a very high premium to where Slack traded just in the summer. Is that</p>
<p>right? Chamath? So it looked like a peak. It&rsquo;s basically if you look at the it&rsquo;s a 10% premium,</p>
<p>right? Yeah, 10% premium. Yeah. 10% premium. Yeah, we opened the direct listing at 40 or 41.</p>
<p>And this was at 45. Right. And so there clearly was a sense of weakness from the board, which is,</p>
<p>I think why the Salesforce stock traded down afterwards, because if they were willing to sell</p>
<p>at that small of a premium, the forecast internally is probably feeling not that strong. And then</p>
<p>people translate that into, hey, Salesforce bought something that&rsquo;s not that strong.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something a little bit amiss, but but obviously, to your point,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re missing a lot of the cross selling and the synergy that that will, I think it&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>slam dunk acquisition. And I go back to the this idea of intercompany network effects. I think they</p>
<p>exist, and I think they&rsquo;re real. And I think that the Slack, the the Slack product teams ability to</p>
<p>innovate around that was not as fast as it could have been, but it was still very unique. And I</p>
<p>think it was, it was a true moat. And you know, the, the tragedy is, we won&rsquo;t see what the terminal</p>
<p>value is if they were left alone to execute. And in this weird way, like I&rsquo;ve always struggled with</p>
<p>why Microsoft was so overly obsessed with Slack, because if you look at the team&rsquo;s product, it was</p>
<p>much more directly competitive with zoom. And to this day still remains much more directly competitive</p>
<p>with zoom than Slack. But you know, there we have it. And if you look at the revenue, Slack was</p>
<p>doing 800 million run rates, I know we rounded up to a billion, and yet Salesforce at 20 billion.</p>
<p>So 5% revenue to revenue, and then they got 10% of the company. So in that way, if you look at</p>
<p>on a percentage basis, which is, you know, how you might look at the Facebook, Instagram, and</p>
<p>WhatsApp is what percentage of the existing entity did they get?</p>
<p>Slides going about 60% a year and Salesforce is growing about 22% something like that.</p>
<p>The other thing is the president of Salesforce is Brett Taylor, who was our CTO at Facebook,</p>
<p>who I worked with. And so I think Brett also understands network effects really well.</p>
<p>And you know, by the way, in this interesting twist of fate, Benioff was the underbidder,</p>
<p>I think for LinkedIn. And so, you know, we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve seen mark around the hoop on these,</p>
<p>you know, social network network effect business tool acquisitions before and finally,</p>
<p>also Twitter, he was running, he was hanging around the basket with Twitter. And then they</p>
<p>also brought his name up for Tick Tock, which made no sense. So I think Benioff is just looking at</p>
<p>this, like, if if Google and Microsoft and Apple are too scared to buy things because of antitrust,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m under the radar of the antitrust trillion dollars. So I&rsquo;m the only one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s under the radar, because he doesn&rsquo;t have a play in this sort of communication</p>
<p>or collaboration space. And so therefore, there are no antitrust issues. If Microsoft were to do</p>
<p>it, it would definitely be scrutinized, because you could argue that they&rsquo;re adding to their</p>
<p>existing dominant market share and, and collaboration. But Benioff&rsquo;s dream has</p>
<p>always been at least since he, you know, launched chatter to compete with with us when we were</p>
<p>doing Yammer, this is back in 2010, 2011, is he his dream has always been to have a product that</p>
<p>could get him onto every seat in the enterprise, you know, his current product set has is departmental,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got kind of the CRM product for sales, and they&rsquo;ve got the support cloud for</p>
<p>customer support, and they&rsquo;ve got the marketing cloud for marketing. And so he&rsquo;s gone department</p>
<p>by department, but he&rsquo;s never really had a sort of pan like cross company. Yeah, something that</p>
<p>the entire company would use, like a central login system, right? And Slack is that central</p>
<p>login system. But when you when he came up against you, it was very, you know, Benioff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re friendly with Benioff. Benioff came at you so hard. He threw three or 400 engineers at</p>
<p>chatter. He took out full page Wall Street Journal ads. He tried to poach your people.</p>
<p>He tried to make the product free. He made it personal against you after you would not sell to</p>
<p>him. True or false, David Sachs? I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think he made it personal. But it was definitely</p>
<p>feel personal. No, no, no, no, no. He did. That&rsquo;s I understood what he was trying to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your way of saying no, I mean, if we had sold to Salesforce, like we ended up so what I</p>
<p>would say is, yeah, we got in like a very, it was a very competitive situation. He didn&rsquo;t beat us.</p>
<p>You know, I was that he found does that product even exist? Yeah. It&rsquo;s sort of like a feed inside</p>
<p>of the the CRM product. It didn&rsquo;t really succeed as a standalone collaboration product. And so</p>
<p>we won that battle. But it definitely I would say it scared us enough to sell to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Because, you know, the what did we were about to we were about to enter a new stage of competition.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what happened is he launched his product to kind of be a clone of Yammer inside</p>
<p>of Salesforce, but he was initially charging $15 per seat, we were charging like five.</p>
<p>And so they massively overpriced it and they event and then they they were on this like,</p>
<p>slippery slope where they kept lowering the price to compete better with us.</p>
<p>And then finally, they realized that they should give the thing away for free as a strategic move.</p>
<p>And that was when we decided to sell it to Microsoft is we didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we knew we had a better product than chatter, but we didn&rsquo;t know how it would go. If we were</p>
<p>up against a free chat. Tell us honestly, how much did he offer? What was the meeting like</p>
<p>where he made you the offer? We Yeah, so take a look. Yeah. So here&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll tell you the backstory.</p>
<p>I mean, this hasn&rsquo;t been publicly publicly revealed. But</p>
<p>in service of the all in podcast,</p>
<p>in service of trying to get us from number three to number one on the charts.</p>
<p>No, you know, it&rsquo;s funny, we launched Yammer at the TechCrunch 40 conference that Jason,</p>
<p>as you know, you&rsquo;re the co founder of, and Benioff was like a judge, he was a panelist,</p>
<p>and he was raving about it. And you could just, you know, from from the moment we launched,</p>
<p>he was raving about it, you could see the light bulb go off with him. And he realized that like,</p>
<p>social was going to be it was, you know, at the time, obviously, social was big with consumer</p>
<p>social networks, but he saw the potential social or collaboration inside the enterprise.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I mean, like, I think a year later or something, they were interested in buying the</p>
<p>company for around $250 million. The big issue for them, though, was that Benioff had a bunch of</p>
<p>like engineers who wanted to build it in house. And so they, they actually, I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>would have happened if, if they, you know, didn&rsquo;t want to build it themselves. But basically,</p>
<p>they vetoed doing a deal. And so they ended up building chatter. And they threw the 300</p>
<p>engineers at it. And they basically spun their wheels for a few years. And anyway, it turned out</p>
<p>to be much better for us, because we ended up selling the company for five times as much</p>
<p>to Microsoft. You know, if we had sold to Salesforce in like 2010, it would have been a</p>
<p>much smaller deal. But yeah, that I mean, he was very interested in it from the from the get go.</p>
<p>All right, folks, so you have a breaking news in the background on what actually</p>
<p>happened. Congratulations to Stuart and the team.</p>
<p>I want to ask a question to Martin Sachs. Did you guys keep all of the shares you you</p>
<p>originally invested in? To the exit here, just to set the context for folks,</p>
<p>you know, you invest in a company, it&rsquo;s a small startup, 30 billion? Yeah.</p>
<p>For every share that I owned, half of it were half. No. Yeah, for of 100 shares that I owned,</p>
<p>per every 100 that I owned. 10 of them I sold at 38 right at the direct listing.</p>
<p>I want to say 40 of them I sold in the mid 20s. And the rest of it just got taken out at this price.</p>
<p>So your dollar cost average to the you know, whatever high 30s, maybe 40 or so?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know my exact. I mean, I sold some and I still own some. So</p>
<p>um, yeah, I definitely got my my beak wet from this acquisition.</p>
<p>But no, but look, I think I probably sold, you know, more than half of them,</p>
<p>you know, and that was a mistake. And you know, one of my biggest</p>
<p>learnings as an investor has been to let your winners ride. You know, my biggest mistake as an</p>
<p>investor has not been the losers. It&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s been selling the winners prematurely.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uber as well, David. And I sold some Uber before, but I kept a lot of my Uber,</p>
<p>maybe most of it, or half of it, I think. Anyway, Uber, Facebook, I mean, Facebook,</p>
<p>you know, when they IPO it was worth 50 billion. We all thought that was like unbelievable. I mean,</p>
<p>because it was over a 50 x return. But what&rsquo;s the lesson? Just never sell anything if you can help</p>
<p>it. I sold my Facebook in 2014 and bought Amazon and Tesla. I think that you have to be able to</p>
<p>sell for two reasons, liquidity, and moral obligation. Hmm. Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>exaggeration. I mean, you can never it&rsquo;s people need to be able to sell but to the extent you can</p>
<p>hold on. Just don&rsquo;t sell everything, you know, always, you keep</p>
<p>Yeah, keep selling. I mean, think about the people who were at Apple in the 80s or Microsoft</p>
<p>in the 80s or Amazon in the 90s. A lot of those people got frustrated holding the shares for so</p>
<p>long. And I think keeping at least 20% of your shares forever, you know, could be amazing. There</p>
<p>was somebody told me had never sold a single share of. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a true story or not.</p>
<p>I told you that you can&rsquo;t be leaking that information.</p>
<p>Okay. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t know that was a leak.</p>
<p>Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop.</p>
<p>More breaking news.</p>
<p>Boop. Let&rsquo;s move to AlphaFold. Let&rsquo;s move to AlphaFold.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move to AlphaFold.</p>
<p>Must credit all-in podcast.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>The same may or may not be true with **** and his shares.</p>
<p>You know what we should do is we should do a we should put beeps in there, Nick. I was told</p>
<p>had never sold a share of and then we just let everybody react to it.</p>
<p>This way, nobody knows what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I do know that **** has not sold a single share of **** and it has only sold</p>
<p>shares of **** to fund capital calls, which is an incredible statement to</p>
<p>fortitude and vision. Incredible.</p>
<p>Lord.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s not always worked out because he did the same with **** and those didn&rsquo;t go as well.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, look, you have to diversify when you&rsquo;ve got all your eggs in one basket</p>
<p>in one company. Obviously, you have to sell some shares. But one of the things I&rsquo;ve just learned</p>
<p>over the last 20 years is probably people ask me, what&rsquo;s your biggest regret or learning or</p>
<p>whatever? It&rsquo;s just selling too early is like one of the biggest mistakes you can make.</p>
<p>Look at PayPal. PayPal is now a $250 billion company. We sold it in 2002 for 1.5 billion.</p>
<p>We thought that was a great deal at the time and we sold it for less than 1% of what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth today and the product&rsquo;s basically the same. It&rsquo;s just compounding.</p>
<p>Is the lesson. Never sell. If it&rsquo;s a winner, ride it. You can pair.</p>
<p>Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I&rsquo;m going to put a final nail in this coffin. Then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go to AlphaFold. There&rsquo;s a great quote by Warren Buffett, which is,</p>
<p>if you know what you&rsquo;re doing, the best thing you can do is be as concentrated as possible.</p>
<p>Nobody ever got rich in their seventh best idea. And I think that that basically sums it up. But</p>
<p>you have to be in a position to have the ability to have that kind of portfolio allocation.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Freebird, explain AlphaFold, please.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s explain. Give me two minutes on I&rsquo;ll explain proteins and then the importance</p>
<p>of proteins in an AlphaFold. So the numbers to remember are 4, 3 and 20. There are four</p>
<p>nucleic acids that make up your DNA. We all learned this in high school biology.</p>
<p>Sets of three A, C, T and G combinations define an amino acid. There are 20 amino acids.</p>
<p>And a protein is a string of amino acids. So in your body, in every cell, there are these</p>
<p>organelles. They make proteins by reading the DNA, taking a copy of it and turning it into</p>
<p>amino acid chains. And that&rsquo;s what we kind of call proteins.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is when you make a chain of amino acids, so there&rsquo;s 20 of them</p>
<p>that you could put in each point in the chain, it doesn&rsquo;t come out as a long chain. What happens is</p>
<p>those amino acids, the whole thing collapses and it turns into a very specific shape.</p>
<p>And the shape of that protein is what defines its function.</p>
<p>So pretty much every biological function across all life is undertaken by proteins doing something.</p>
<p>Some proteins like hemoglobin in our red blood cells will have a very specific little pocket</p>
<p>where oxygen molecules stick into the pocket and then it moves the oxygen from your lungs</p>
<p>to your cells. It&rsquo;s a pretty amazing protein to exist. And it specifically is shaped to do that</p>
<p>exact function. There are other proteins that can, for example, rip apart other molecules,</p>
<p>break a molecular bond. There are other proteins, for example, that can take nitrogen out of the</p>
<p>atmosphere and put it into plants, cells that the plants can then use to grow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible, you know, a set of potential on the nanoscale of what you can</p>
<p>do with proteins. And we see that in life. And we&rsquo;re just shocked and awed and amazed by it every</p>
<p>day. But in order to figure out how to create proteins that do specific things, you have to</p>
<p>know how do those amino acids turn into the shape that the protein ultimately takes. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called protein folding. And so the hard thing is, and, you know, why is this important?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important because we can easily read DNA and therefore we can figure out what amino acid</p>
<p>sequence is being made to define that protein. But what we don&rsquo;t know really well is what is the</p>
<p>shape of that protein? And therefore, how does it undertake the function that we see it taking in</p>
<p>biology? And if you think about the reverse of this, the reverse of this, if you have a function</p>
<p>you want to undertake in biology, you can design a protein to do that function for you, for example,</p>
<p>bind to a specific point on a cancer cell, or, you know, take carbon out of the atmosphere,</p>
<p>or pretty much anything else your mind can kind of imagine. On the nanoscale,</p>
<p>proteins can be designed to do the challenges, how do you write the code, which is the DNA</p>
<p>to make the protein that does that thing? Well, we don&rsquo;t know how the code turns into the shape.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what folding the folding problem is. So the folding problem, there&rsquo;s a data set,</p>
<p>and the data set is what&rsquo;s the three dimensional shape of a protein? And then what&rsquo;s the DNA code</p>
<p>that defines the amino acid sequence that makes that protein? And how do you figure out how to</p>
<p>predict the shape of the protein from the amino acid sequence, it has been an impossibility. And,</p>
<p>again, if you think about this chain of amino acids, they each have little,</p>
<p>you know, electrical spaces, and the way that they bind to each other, it&rsquo;s very complicated,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just deterministically define it. You know, we don&rsquo;t have that level of understanding</p>
<p>on a quantum scale. So what alpha fold has done is they have now been able to predict</p>
<p>from a sequence of amino acids, what the protein shape will ultimately become,</p>
<p>by learning from a database of hundreds of 1000s of structural protein</p>
<p>shapes that have been defined through really, really, really difficult, you know,</p>
<p>scanning microscopes and other techniques to really try and scan a protein on a microscopic</p>
<p>scale. And then looking at the DNA sequence and figuring out, okay, what&rsquo;s the relationship?</p>
<p>And the accuracy of their predictive model now is within the range of error of the microscopes that</p>
<p>are being used to actually scan and measure those proteins. So that&rsquo;s incredible. Because now,</p>
<p>theoretically, you could come up with a design for a protein. And you could actually build that</p>
<p>protein by writing the amino acid sequence. And that protein can do any number of things you want</p>
<p>to do. And this has been a difficult problem that&rsquo;s been intractable by humanity. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been challenged by it for decades. For this machine learning breakthrough, to kind of be</p>
<p>realized in literally less than three years. I mean, these guys were at a score of 40.</p>
<p>Last year, and this year, they&rsquo;re at like nearly 90, which is incredible. And so now, you know,</p>
<p>we can now predict what the shape will be from the from the DNA sequence. And,</p>
<p>and this is going to unlock this ability, everyone&rsquo;s now going to take their model,</p>
<p>if they license it, or whatever they do with it, or people are going to go learn using the same</p>
<p>techniques that DeepMind used. But it just means that it&rsquo;s possible. And then scientists will go</p>
<p>away. And they&rsquo;ll say, you know what, I want to do this particular thing on a microscopic scale,</p>
<p>let me design in three dimensional space a protein to do that thing. Okay, now let me go figure out</p>
<p>how to make that protein by writing the DNA code, which is really easy if you can use this algorithm</p>
<p>to solve that for you. And it is literally dollars and pennies to make proteins, we can write DNA on</p>
<p>a computer, we can get printed DNA sent to us in 48 hours in a FedEx envelope for a DNA printing</p>
<p>facility, we can put it in a in a microbe, and we can get that microbe to make the protein for us in</p>
<p>a day, the lab costs, any high school biology class can do this now. So by being able to actually</p>
<p>figure out what DNA to write, based on the objective function of what do we want the protein</p>
<p>to do, it&rsquo;s going to unlock this universe of things we can do in medicine. In environmental science,</p>
<p>we can do things like break apart PET plastics, we can do things like fixing nitrogen from the</p>
<p>atmosphere and getting rid of fertilizer plants, we can create all sorts of new,</p>
<p>you know, food solutions, health solutions, environmental solutions,</p>
<p>any chance you can make a pizza that doesn&rsquo;t have carbohydrates, because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about here is, is there a way healthy pasta or pizza, or something like that? But in</p>
<p>all seriousness, what do you think the early wins will be out of this technology? And is this a</p>
<p>theoretical win that will benefit from in 20 years? Or is this a serious breakthrough that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to benefit from in the near term, like no, I think one to five years,</p>
<p>both are true. This is an incredibly important advancement in machine learning.</p>
<p>But the reality is that, you know, Google will still have to spend a deep mind will have to</p>
<p>spend a lot of time refining it. And then they have some really big ethical challenges ahead</p>
<p>of it. How do you expose this technology to whom and under what conditions. And it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>situation that open AI has with GPT-3. Although a lot of people I think, you know, the scale of</p>
<p>the computer science challenge maybe was a bigger win in GPT-3, because it was a much more open</p>
<p>space. And I think this is a much more specific, sort of almost expert system in a way. But the</p>
<p>downstream commercial implications of this are just enormous. And so just think about this,</p>
<p>like this is where like, you gotta you gotta love companies like Google, the fact that they exist,</p>
<p>because from, you know, page rank in 1999, to CPC ads in 2003, and four,</p>
<p>we have alpha fold in 2020. And that to me is just that&rsquo;s just an argument against breaking</p>
<p>up tech, because only a tech company with this amount of resource knowledge can then go spend</p>
<p>a billion dollars on deep mind. I mean,</p>
<p>alphabets burning four to $5 billion a year on their quote, unquote, other bets line,</p>
<p>and people give them a lot of shit for it. But I mean, you hit any one of these things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s $100 billion payday. I mean, look at YouTube, YouTube&rsquo;s easily $100 billion payday</p>
<p>on a billion dollar bet, billion six. Oh, no, that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s a 250 to $500</p>
<p>billion applied semantics. A lot of people miss this, but applied semantics was $100 million</p>
<p>bet. And that&rsquo;s the entirety of AdSense initially, Android, Android.</p>
<p>Is this is this the first commercial application of deep mind? Because until now, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had alpha zero. So there was a period of time, a lot of people, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let me just think about this for a second. Alpha zero was really good.</p>
<p>I want to be careful about this. But I do think it was disclosed that they&rsquo;ve used deep mind</p>
<p>to improve ads quality and improve YouTube viewing. And as a result of that,</p>
<p>you get the number of hours per day of the average user on YouTube to double or triple</p>
<p>ad revenue goes by three x. And I think in one quarter, Google was able to generate</p>
<p>something like an incremental 15 billion annualized revenue from deep minds.</p>
<p>And you know what that deep mind actually did on YouTube? It sent everybody to the</p>
<p>alt right and info wars and Ben Shapiro. Congratulations. Be careful when you</p>
<p>set people&rsquo;s minds with artificial intelligence. Maybe you just argued to break them up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I understand sacks that it&rsquo;s being used broadly across the products at Google.</p>
<p>In a in a now now in a much more careful way is my understanding. Look, I&rsquo;m a I&rsquo;m a I&rsquo;m a big</p>
<p>ally of alphabet. I&rsquo;m a big fan. And I love you know, they were and I used to work there. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very close to people there. So I know he used to be on the board and was the major backer of that</p>
<p>company. Deep mind founders fund founders fund. Elon Musk, too. And he begged them to not sell</p>
<p>to Google because I mean, $400 million, $400 million exit was a steal for 40 or 50 scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolute steal.</p>
<p>No, Elon. I mean, Elon has publicly said that he thinks deep mind is like the greatest threat.</p>
<p>Well, he thinks AI is a great threat to humanity. And of the people working on</p>
<p>AI, deep mind is the furthest along and therefore most dangerous.</p>
<p>He tried to stop me. I mean, he told me straight up, like when he&rsquo;s been very public about the</p>
<p>sense that he he said, I&rsquo;ll give you an unlimited amount of money to not sell to Google. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends with Larry Page, too. But he said, don&rsquo;t sell. I want you to be independent. I want you</p>
<p>to keep working on this. But he said that when he saw the AI there become aware that it was an AI,</p>
<p>that that was when he was like, wait a second.</p>
<p>No, wait, deep, deep mind is not alphas, alpha folder, alpha zeros, not self aware.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s felt it was becoming self aware that it knew what it was. I don&rsquo;t know if that was just</p>
<p>Elon, you know, just sort of no, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s not self aware. So I mean, I&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>the Yeah, I mean, the amazing things that deep mind has released prior to this were</p>
<p>games, right? They had this chess, this chess AI called alpha zero, which rapidly became not just</p>
<p>the best chess. It not only beat every human in the world, it also beat every chess engine because</p>
<p>computers became more, you know, better at chess than humans long time ago, because of their</p>
<p>sheer computational power, but alpha zero plays like a human, but with kind of that same</p>
<p>computational power. And so that created a whole revolution in chess engines. And then they also</p>
<p>did that with a game called go the credit alpha go. And basically every single game that you can</p>
<p>think of, deep minds created, you know, an alpha, whatever alpha version that destroys both humans</p>
<p>and computers. But this is the first thing they&rsquo;ve publicly announced that, that seems like</p>
<p>it will be available to others. Eventually, that could have tremendous social impact.</p>
<p>Imagine the government trying to understand this. Can you imagine them being brought before</p>
<p>like senators? These are these are these are the new weapons of mass destruction. I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest, like if, if somebody else had had alpha fold, and probably somebody doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just hasn&rsquo;t said, you know, I mean, Google actually values transparency. So that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only reason why we know. Imagine what they could do, as Friedberg said, it&rsquo;s like, you know, the,</p>
<p>the opposite of this is basically to design a specific protein that basically, you know,</p>
<p>destroys organs, or there are proteins called prions, which are the scariest thing known in</p>
<p>biology, in my opinion, a prion is a protein that it actually finds similar proteins. And</p>
<p>based on the shape, it gets those proteins to change, and it becomes like a virus.</p>
<p>And prions actually are, there&rsquo;s an extremely sad series of diseases that are related to prions,</p>
<p>where your body expresses a protein in the wrong way. And then that protein itself gets other</p>
<p>proteins to change and creates copies of itself. And it spreads. It is a fascinatingly scary</p>
<p>biological phenomenon. But you know, there are extremely scary things you can do with the</p>
<p>designer protein capability. Basically, you could make a bio weapon that would be similar to what</p>
<p>the aliens and Prometheus and aliens were doing the engineers even much worse, even much worse.</p>
<p>This is why I think they&rsquo;re going to spend years before. So this is why back to that earlier</p>
<p>question, it&rsquo;ll be years before this sees the light of day because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re smart enough</p>
<p>to know what they&rsquo;ve uncovered. And I think they did they did the right thing by talking about it,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a lot of really amazing R&amp;D. But the reality is that Google for the next</p>
<p>20 or 30 years, we&rsquo;ll have layers and layers of oversight. Because, you know, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to allow a company to enrich uranium in Mountain View without oversight. And this is the</p>
<p>equivalent, it&rsquo;s just the we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re buying time until governments realize that they have to do</p>
<p>that they have to do it. But let&rsquo;s also remember the protein data set they trained on is publicly</p>
<p>available. You know, anyone can access this. And with the, you know, a catch up in machine learning,</p>
<p>you know, capability to deep mind, infrastructure wise, theoretically, you know, someone could,</p>
<p>could I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an inevitability that in the next 24 months, someone else will write this</p>
<p>right now, I think what DeepMind has done is showed that specific techniques of learning</p>
<p>can overcome limitations in compute. But to your point, David, like we&rsquo;re accelerating silicon at a</p>
<p>fast enough speed where, you know, if like, if you can throw 510 50 100 500 pet ops at a problem,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know, you can run, you know, some really, really old version of TensorFlow and</p>
<p>probably get to the same answer. Yeah, I actually think they published, I&rsquo;m going to find it while</p>
<p>you guys are chatting, but they published what the compute needs were on running this. I&rsquo;ll find it</p>
<p>in a second. Tell you, because</p>
<p>I may make one sort of slightly dissenting point on the whole WMD thing. I mean, look, obviously,</p>
<p>the, you know, who has access, this technology needs to be controlled, we do have to make sure</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t get into the hands of bad actors. But the reality is, there&rsquo;s plenty of existing WMDs</p>
<p>out there that have been around for a long time that bad actors could get their hands on,</p>
<p>they could already make, you know, extremely dangerous viruses in a lab, they could,</p>
<p>you know, take something that&rsquo;s as contagious as smallpox and make it as deadly as Ebola or</p>
<p>something like that. And it&rsquo;s these new technologies that provide a way for us to</p>
<p>combat those those WMDs. Because, you know, technology has a tendency to become democratized.</p>
<p>You know, was it 75 years ago, the US was the only country that had an atomic weapon. Now,</p>
<p>what, like close to 10 have, you know, nuclear atomic weapons. And so, you know, these,</p>
<p>these sort of nefarious technologies get democratized anyway. And we really need some</p>
<p>of these new technologies and new abilities as a way to combat them. It&rsquo;s like last week,</p>
<p>we were talking about the ability now to basically print, you know, a vaccine using this mRNA</p>
<p>technique within two days, you know, you can imagine, you know, if someone tried to use a</p>
<p>bioweapon create a new virus, we could print a vaccine the next day. Those are the kinds of</p>
<p>capabilities we&rsquo;re going to need to fight the spread of WMD. I think you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that you then have a law of large numbers problem, meaning, you know, the previous problem before is</p>
<p>you had 180 190 200 state sponsored actors. So if you had a 1%, you know, rate of people who are</p>
<p>just bad, you&rsquo;re talking about two states. Now, when you talk about 5 billion people getting</p>
<p>access to code that&rsquo;s basically running an AWS or GCP instance someplace, and you have a 1%,</p>
<p>you know, bad guy rate, all of a sudden, that 1% really matters. And I think that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the law of large numbers, David applied to very, very small rates of immorality.</p>
<p>But I mean, you can already do very scary things with, you know, recombinant DNA,</p>
<p>taking DNA from one organism, putting in another and sending that organism out. And, you know,</p>
<p>theoretically, you could have designed a virus that would spread throughout humanity and cause</p>
<p>a lot of death, right? I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of this capability that people would have found that</p>
<p>out. Because like, you can&rsquo;t run these labs, and you&rsquo;re not going to get, you know, monkey models</p>
<p>or mouse models. It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a trail of breadcrumbs there that is easier to</p>
<p>track, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree that just running an instance in a simulation on GCP, sending it</p>
<p>someplace to then have a protein printed that comes into FedEx envelope to you.</p>
<p>And you have to hire, we saw in Iran with, you know, their chief scientist being whacked by</p>
<p>whoever accidentally whacked him with 60 people. Like, you need to have the brainpower to do this,</p>
<p>once you have the brainpower to do it, you can track that brainpower. And we had, for the last,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, since we even tested nuclear bombs, we&rsquo;ve had these special planes flying</p>
<p>around the globe looking for the signature of nuclear detonations, or any kind of nuclear</p>
<p>fallout. And we&rsquo;ve been flying those forever. I think, I think, I think, I think biodefense is</p>
<p>going to become probably one of the biggest industries on planet Earth, starting in the</p>
<p>latter half of this century, because you&rsquo;re going to get to a point where digital biology is like a</p>
<p>tool, just like software was in the 80s, where suddenly everyone could access it, everyone could</p>
<p>use it, everyone could do stuff with it. You have this ubiquity of scary shit happening.</p>
<p>Hackers everywhere. Hold on, Freebird, didn&rsquo;t we have that as well in those same claims about</p>
<p>nuclear power? And we were been able to, for 100 years, with nuclear, nuclear, in particular,</p>
<p>with nuclear, in particular, there is a material problem, you have to source and refine material</p>
<p>to do something scary. With biology, you don&rsquo;t, you can do this anywhere, you can do it on your</p>
<p>desktop at home. And you know, it&rsquo;s getting easier, cheaper, faster. And you can use software</p>
<p>and a printer and you know, a cheap sequencer and do stuff. Do we believe that China has this</p>
<p>Freebird? Yes, China, for sure. Yeah. I mean, look, this is yeah, I think the head of DeepMind</p>
<p>are behind 100% 100%. So here&rsquo;s the stats that DeepMind put out, it took them the equivalent</p>
<p>of 100 to 200 GPUs run over a few weeks to build this model. That is, I don&rsquo;t care how advanced</p>
<p>DeepMind is at this point. That&rsquo;s, you know, if that&rsquo;s the model, then someone else can replicate</p>
<p>that, you know, someone, that&rsquo;s what happened to alpha zero, that DeepMind chess engine after they</p>
<p>proved it, now there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of chess AIs. And I think we&rsquo;re within within one year,</p>
<p>Jaykal, of a lot of startups replicating this alpha fold technique, and then using that to</p>
<p>go do drug discovery. And you&rsquo;ll see 50 startups getting funded 12 to 18 months from now based on</p>
<p>some novel protein idea. And I think that this we got to get our beach wet on this on the ISAs.</p>
<p>Everybody go to this is getting ridiculous. Everybody go to the syndicate.com slash all in.</p>
<p>We should create a protein folding syndicate. Yeah, absolutely. Here it is. Everybody go to</p>
<p>the syndicate.com slash all in. If we do this, I&rsquo;m collecting the emails now.</p>
<p>I will make my first series of bets less on the application and more on the protection.</p>
<p>I think biodefense 30 years from now is going to be so important.</p>
<p>If you want to invest with the best ease,</p>
<p>can there is there going to be a protein that prevents Rudy Giuliani from farting?</p>
<p>I mean, what is going on sacks? Let&rsquo;s throw to you as our resident right wing.</p>
<p>Joking sacks. Don&rsquo;t take it so personal. We know you didn&rsquo;t vote for Trump.</p>
<p>We know you did a write in vote for Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this. Have you have you or have you not had dinner with Tucker Carlson?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big pause. I call all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually. Yeah, I know. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had dinner with Tucker.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve been to a party with Tucker Carlson. No, no. But let me let me get to</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening is, well, I feel my dream of gridlock in Washington for the next four years</p>
<p>is slipping away. You know, the you know, I described this as sort of like it was kind of</p>
<p>a dream scenario that you&rsquo;d have a divided Congress and the Republicans, you know, they won</p>
<p>50 they won 50 seats in the Senate in November. And then, you know, because of this stupid rule</p>
<p>in Georgia that you have to you can&rsquo;t just win. You have to win by having over 50 percent.</p>
<p>The Republicans would have had 51. But now there&rsquo;s a runoff for these two open seats.</p>
<p>And the Republicans were ahead in the polls at the time. They were the more I think it was</p>
<p>mostly it&rsquo;s based on the candidates being more popular than the Democratic candidates. But now,</p>
<p>because of all these antics around the election, the Democrats have both Democrat candidates have</p>
<p>pulled ahead. And so, yeah, they are now Democratic candidates in the last couple of the last week or</p>
<p>so. Ossoff is ahead of Perdue by about two points, which is a stunner because Perdue has already</p>
<p>beaten him before he beat him in the November election. He&rsquo;s a better candidate, though,</p>
<p>right. And the margin of error was sworn to the Republican. Right. But Warnock is seven points</p>
<p>ahead of Loeffler. So that one is outside the margin of error. He&rsquo;s clearly beating her. And,</p>
<p>you know, and now it looks like Perdue&rsquo;s in danger to the Republicans just need to win</p>
<p>one of those in order for us to have, you know, divided government in Washington,</p>
<p>which I think tends to produce better results than giving one party all the levers of power.</p>
<p>But but this is this is the crazy thing. And so I think even from Trump&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>you know, I think this is a branding exercise to, you know, prove that he didn&rsquo;t lose. The problem</p>
<p>is, how&rsquo;s that going? Well, it&rsquo;s not working. And it looks like it&rsquo;s going to cost Republicans</p>
<p>the Senate, which is something that I think he won&rsquo;t come back from. So if I was advising the</p>
<p>president, I would tell him to drop this, you know, these these legal challenges. They fired</p>
<p>Sidney Powell from the legal team, which I think was a good decision because of her crazy wild</p>
<p>allegations. But now Rudy&rsquo;s out there doing the same stuff. Rudy Giuliani.</p>
<p>The answer that I gave you is they didn&rsquo;t bother to interview a single witness.</p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani. He was adjusting. He wasn&rsquo;t waking up the genie. He was he was tucking his pants in,</p>
<p>laying down in the bedroom, having a drink with a Russian underage.</p>
<p>I mean, Rudy is just I mean, fresh off his his guest starring appearance in the Borat movies.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s uncredited. Yeah, it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s reenacting my cousin Vinnie or something in these</p>
<p>in these hearings. How many it&rsquo;s going to cost Republicans the Senate?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s so amazing. Like the Democrats basically have now have a stone cold</p>
<p>free roll, because there is a very good chance that these guys are going to win these two Senate</p>
<p>seats, which would just be absolutely incredible. Absolutely.</p>
<p>So Republicans are definitely figuring this out. Rich Lowry had a great column. He&rsquo;s a editor of</p>
<p>National Review. He&rsquo;s on the right, but I think provides very good objective political analysis.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sound his last column sounded the alarm bells about what was happening in Georgia.</p>
<p>And look, if the if the issue in the Georgia runoffs is are these antics if it&rsquo;s Rudy and</p>
<p>Sidney Powell, the public is going to lose the seat that both seats if the question of the</p>
<p>election is whether Democrats should have a free hand to ram through whatever legislation they want,</p>
<p>then I think the Republicans win. So the question is, what is that election going to be about? And</p>
<p>the longer that Rudy stays on the stage, making these crazy wild allegations, the worse it gets</p>
<p>for Republicans. When is the Georgia runoff election? This January 5 or 10. It&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those two. January 5, I think. My gosh, would anybody here if they had gray hair, and I know</p>
<p>we have three gentlemen on the call who have gray hair, Friedberg, somehow you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>might be maybe I&rsquo;ve answered this question just not on his head. Just would any of you</p>
<p>dye your hair if you were a 7987 year old Rudy Giuliani? No, my hair is white and getting</p>
<p>whiter. It&rsquo;s like it is what it is. It&rsquo;s a passage of time, I would just move on.</p>
<p>David, would you consider just taking that gray right out of your hair? Because you have the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the silver fox as it stands. Would you ever consider it? You can see the decision I&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>but look, that&rsquo;s not I mean, it&rsquo;s Yeah, I mean, that was just like a meltdown. I mean,</p>
<p>a literal meltdown, a literal meltdown. And it was so like representative of the moment,</p>
<p>the congressional republicans want to use a hook to get Rudy off the stage. I mean,</p>
<p>they cannot wait to get him off the stage. And why don&rsquo;t they just stand up and just tell</p>
<p>Trump to shut this down? I think I think it&rsquo;s coming. It&rsquo;s coming. So yeah. Oh,</p>
<p>wow. So the republicans are gonna stand up to Trump with four weeks left in office. Wow.</p>
<p>What a profile and courage. Friedberg, are you dying your hair? Do you have gray hair?</p>
<p>And are you actually dying? Or have you not hit gray? Just tell us right now. It&rsquo;s an emergency</p>
<p>pod. No, it&rsquo;s the truth. David, are you dying your hair? Yes or no? This is it.</p>
<p>Is there so many ways have an opinion on whether Trump is allowed to pre pardon himself and his</p>
<p>kids? It&rsquo;s exactly where I was going. Yes. Well, yes. All right. When he definitely pardoned his</p>
<p>kids. I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s an open legal question whether he can pardon himself. Can you</p>
<p>pre pardon? What does it mean pre pardon in this definition? You mean, you can only pardon for a</p>
<p>committed crime, right? I mean, that&rsquo;s traditionally no part of it was a blanket,</p>
<p>right? Well, you can pardon for things that happened in the past. I don&rsquo;t think you can</p>
<p>pardon for things that happen in the future. And you can you can get a blanket part. No,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to define it. I think you could just do a blanket pardon.</p>
<p>The I would advise Trump not to do it if I were one of his advisors. And the reason is</p>
<p>that he can only pardon for federal. And the big problem the Trump family has right now is,</p>
<p>you know, the Southern District of New York, these mad dog prosecutors who are</p>
<p>Democrats, you know, I don&rsquo;t approve of it. This is this is to me, this is the to me,</p>
<p>this is the criminalization of political differences. I don&rsquo;t I think it&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>if he could pardon because I do think that those guys are again, they&rsquo;re trying to criminalize</p>
<p>political differences. But but pardoning doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem with the Southern District of</p>
<p>New York. And Biden has already said that he doesn&rsquo;t believe in having any having these having</p>
<p>like a federal investigation of Trump. And so I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think Trump has anything to</p>
<p>worry about federally. I think the problem is, can I just say, it&rsquo;s just so fucking decent and</p>
<p>classy. Like, isn&rsquo;t it refreshing? It&rsquo;s actually boring. But isn&rsquo;t it just wait, we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about Biden is just so decent Biden. Like, I haven&rsquo;t seen that guy. He&rsquo;s he worked for us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been great. No, I mean, like, well, he disappeared. He doesn&rsquo;t disappear. He&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not crazy. He&rsquo;s Biden, Biden, Biden has done a really has done a few really smart things. I mean,</p>
<p>in his acceptance speech, he did what Churchill advises you to do in victory, which is be magnanimous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s made the right sort of sounds towards reconciliation. I think saying that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe in going after Trump criminally. I mean, look, I don&rsquo;t think that would have been a good</p>
<p>political move anyway, because it would have created a backlash, but it was a smart thing</p>
<p>to say. And so and then I think the other smart thing he&rsquo;s done is, which is very Biden anyway,</p>
<p>which is he&rsquo;s got an establishment all the way for his cabinet. He has not put he hasn&rsquo;t named</p>
<p>any totally crazy progressives to his cabinet yet that the republicans could latch on to</p>
<p>for the Georgia runoffs. And so Biden&rsquo;s doing a very good job right now of appearing non threatening</p>
<p>and doing nothing to nothing to blow up his honeymoon. He and his advisors have run a</p>
<p>perfect, perfect, flawless floor. It&rsquo;s been flawless. I mean, David, you just nailed it,</p>
<p>like all of all the things he could have done to potentially put the Senate at risk,</p>
<p>or to potentially give republicans sort of something to hang their hats on. He has given</p>
<p>zero space, right? Like he has not created a single opening. So you you would have thought</p>
<p>that coming into this election cycle, the way that Trump tried to paint Biden was like,</p>
<p>this, you know, gaffaholic, and instead, he has just been picture pitch perfect.</p>
<p>rocks. Well, I think I think I think he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a gaff machine when he speaks spontaneously,</p>
<p>which he has not done. I mean, every time I&rsquo;ve seen him speak, since the elections be reading</p>
<p>off a teleprompter. But I think that his campaign has run a really good, they have run a good</p>
<p>strategy. And now look, it helps that the press doesn&rsquo;t really challenge. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>weekend at Bernie&rsquo;s, except it&rsquo;s like presidency at Bernie&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s like four years,</p>
<p>they hit him in a basement, he only reads a teleprompter, hold him up, put him in the stage.</p>
<p>But yeah, the press, let him get away with it. I mean, no, no other candidate could have gotten</p>
<p>away with a basement strategy. But the press was so determined to go after Trump that they</p>
<p>really gave him a free pass on what Biden believed in what he was going to do. But look,</p>
<p>Biden has run by Biden has run a very good campaign and a very good transition. And really,</p>
<p>I think the biggest mistake he made during the campaign was not declaring definitively</p>
<p>that he would not try to pack this report. That was his big mistake. And what happened?</p>
<p>The voters split the ticket to give the Senate to the Republicans so that Biden wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>pack the court. And so he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it anyway. And I think maybe his administration</p>
<p>has learned from that mistake, which is don&rsquo;t do anything or say anything that&rsquo;s going to give</p>
<p>Republicans something to latch on to to say that Biden is really a radical, we got to stop him.</p>
<p>And anyway, so now George is in play and Biden could win the Senate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect insight, Sachs, because what you haven&rsquo;t seen as well as you haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>Kamala Harris out there all that much, because that&rsquo;s something Republicans could</p>
<p>glom on to. And you haven&rsquo;t seen AOC, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren,</p>
<p>they are persona no grata. They are not involved in this.</p>
<p>Wow, they are MIA.</p>
<p>They are MIA and the Democrats won&rsquo;t bring them up. And you have Bernie Sanders, like,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t he supposed to be in charge of like&hellip;</p>
<p>Elon Omar wants to cancel rent and mortgages. I mean, they&rsquo;re throwing everything out there</p>
<p>just to see if anything sticks right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Biden has really given Bernie Sanders and that wing of the party the high hat</p>
<p>in these cabinet choices. In fact, he just named a woman to be the head of OMB,</p>
<p>the budget director, who has a huge Twitter feud with Bernie Sanders and the Bernie folks are up</p>
<p>in arms about it. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to get through. But yeah, I mean, Biden has really</p>
<p>stiff-armed a lot of the progressives in this administration.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to be associated with the hysterical left. I mean, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>why would you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an appeal to the right.</p>
<p>I mean, he is appealing to the right to some extent, right? I mean, like,</p>
<p>by not putting those people in place, I think all the moderates on the right are&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never going to be able to appeal to the Trump base. But what he&rsquo;s going to be able to do</p>
<p>is prevent the Republicans from sort of labeling him as a radical and therefore,</p>
<p>win over those independents that he needs.</p>
<p>By the way, back to Trump for one second. I apologize, because I wanted to ask you, David.</p>
<p>I mean, the other thing that could tip Georgia is this whole craziness where Trump is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to veto the defense bill, unless we repeal Section 230. And if you&rsquo;re a military</p>
<p>person in Georgia, you&rsquo;re like, wait a second, you&rsquo;re going to leave my brothers and sisters</p>
<p>in arms, basically lollygagging without any financial support, because you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s tweet policy? It&rsquo;s going to seem kind of crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was one of these classic Trump moves where you feel like&hellip; I think he does have a</p>
<p>good point with respect to the social media companies. I do think they&rsquo;ve been engaging</p>
<p>in censorship. They&rsquo;ve overstepped their bounds. They do deserve some sort of comeuppance or</p>
<p>control. I personally don&rsquo;t think that repealing Section 230 is the way to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for a bunch of reasons that we could get into if you want. But yeah, it was one of these</p>
<p>reflexive Trump tweets. And you heard Republicans in the Senate were very, very quick to shoot it</p>
<p>down. And there was an article in Politico where Republicans were quoted, well, anonymously saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty sick of this shit. That was the quote. And so, yeah, I mean, I think that</p>
<p>Republicans on Capitol Hill are kind of ready for those types of antics to be over.</p>
<p>Okay, should he or will he pardon himself and the kids? I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s what it comes down</p>
<p>to. And I think we should move on. I don&rsquo;t think so. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>matter because I think Biden will leave him alone, and it will not help his biggest risk.</p>
<p>And this is, by the way, why they tried to get Jake Clayton to resign from the SEC and move over</p>
<p>to the Southern District of New York, because they thought maybe he could run some kind of</p>
<p>interference. But I mean, I think the state AGs will want a pound of flesh here. And if I were if</p>
<p>I were advising on Yeah, just if I were advising Trump and and advising him on how to maximize his</p>
<p>legacy, it would be you know, pardon pardon people in the administration been treated unfairly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to pardon yourself. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think he has federal exposure.</p>
<p>And I would and I would tell him that, you know, if Republicans lose these Georgia Senate seats</p>
<p>that he will be blamed for among the base for a long time, and that I think will be hard for him</p>
<p>to get past in four years. And so it&rsquo;s very important, I think, for him to make sure that</p>
<p>at least Purdue wins his election. Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you guys? Can I ask another question? What do you think is going to happen with? So</p>
<p>Trump is trying to make his case. But no one&rsquo;s listening. Twitter keeps putting up his fraudulent,</p>
<p>you know, this is disputed claims, disputed claims thing. And he&rsquo;s been pushing Newsmax and</p>
<p>OANN. Do you think those become viable and real kind of media businesses now? And are they actually</p>
<p>going to steal an audience away from Fox News? 100%? It&rsquo;s already happened. It&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>increasing fragmentation of media, right? Cable networks don&rsquo;t pick them up, do they?</p>
<p>The cable companies? I&rsquo;ve seen I&rsquo;ve seen Newsmax Newsmax</p>
<p>My theory is this entire twisted, like crazy, right? All right. Mania just fades into oblivion.</p>
<p>And the Republican Party reinvents itself. No, no, because they can&rsquo;t win. They can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>win, David. They can&rsquo;t win with this brand. They did. They did win. They did. And they</p>
<p>will not in the future because they just lost. The Republicans won like 10 or 12 seats in the</p>
<p>House. They&rsquo;ve almost got the majority back in the House. They almost certainly will win back</p>
<p>the House and retire Nancy Pelosi in two years during the midterm election. I&rsquo;ll put money on</p>
<p>that right now. They held the Senate local elections. They held the Senate presidency</p>
<p>again with this strategy. You think we can win with the demographic shift with Trump in 2024?</p>
<p>Really? Yeah. You want to go back to that level of crazy?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want the they don&rsquo;t want the crazy, but this idea that the issue set that Trump ran</p>
<p>on and won on is dead. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t agree with that. Yeah, those issues are still there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a better branded face and a standard bearer for those issues. And if you say it in a</p>
<p>less crazy way, and you&rsquo;re generally less crazy, I think that it will resonate with a lot more people</p>
<p>than have already proven that it resonates with. It already resonates with 70 million. Could it</p>
<p>resonate with 75? And could they overtake the White House? It&rsquo;s not inconceivable.</p>
<p>So I think I think we can&rsquo;t all of a sudden say this is signed, sealed and delivered. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fait accompli. And all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s just Democrats the rest of the way. David&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>the down ballot results for the Democrats were not good. And it&rsquo;s a sign that moderate</p>
<p>centrism is the only winning strategy. If you really have a strategy where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I really want to win. And not just me, but my party and generations of people after me,</p>
<p>you have to run a centrist campaign, which is why they&rsquo;re retiring the AOC Elizabeth Warren</p>
<p>Bernie bro contingent, right? So well, yeah, there&rsquo;s a house member group of crazy,</p>
<p>right? There was a there was a democratic house member, I think, Elizabeth Spanberger,</p>
<p>who almost lost her seat, I think in a like a Virginia, like kind of a swing Virginia district,</p>
<p>there was a big call of the Democratic House caucus. And she was just laying into Pelosi and</p>
<p>the leadership there. Because she was basically saying, don&rsquo;t ever mention defund the police</p>
<p>again. You know, if you want me to win my, my swing district next time, do not mention this</p>
<p>ever again. And she was just, this was all in the Washington Post, you know, they, the call was</p>
<p>leaked by about a dozen different press out outlets, which tells you, there was a lot of unhappiness</p>
<p>among the house members who almost lost their seat because of these like radical ideas.</p>
<p>The other the other thing is, and you know, unless all of a sudden, the folks that are in their 20s</p>
<p>and 30s are radically different than many, many generations before them. The reality is that they</p>
<p>will as they get older and wealthier, generally speaking, get more conservative, and we are about</p>
<p>to go through over the next 20 years, $30 trillion of wealth transfer. And so, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>you can wear a Segway, but buttons on buttons on flannel. But at the end of the day, when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, mom and dad pass, pass away, and all of a sudden, you know, you have 45678 million bucks,</p>
<p>and you have to think about your children and your children&rsquo;s children. I tend to think people</p>
<p>generally do very predictably, get more conservative. And so again, another reason why</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t count on a staid interpretation of progressivism, it there will be progressivism,</p>
<p>I think it just will be a different form of policy. And it&rsquo;ll just be more moderate and</p>
<p>centrist and it&rsquo;ll be normal. Which is a perfect segue to the New York Times story that came out</p>
<p>on the Friday after Thanksgiving, November 27, the rich kids who want to tear down capitalism,</p>
<p>socialist minded millennials, millennial heirs are trying to live their values by getting rid of their</p>
<p>money. Lately, Sam Jacobs, and I&rsquo;ll read just a little bit of it has been having a lot of</p>
<p>conversations with his family&rsquo;s lawyers. He&rsquo;s trying to gain access to his trust of 30 his</p>
<p>$30 million trust fund at 25. He&rsquo;s hit the age where many heirs can blow their money on harebrained</p>
<p>businesses or stable of sports cards. He doesn&rsquo;t want to do that. But by wealth management standards,</p>
<p>his plans are just as bad. He wants to give it all away. I want to build a world where someone</p>
<p>like me a young person who controls 10s of millions of dollars as possible. Socialist</p>
<p>college, Mr. Jacobs sees his family&rsquo;s extreme plutocratic wealth as both a moral and economic</p>
<p>failure. His parents will be very proud of first of all, Sam Jacobs sounds like an idiot,</p>
<p>and he shouldn&rsquo;t have any money. So hopefully he gets his wish. Why did his parents give him $30</p>
<p>million? This trust fund should be like given to somebody who deserves it. Like, yeah, but but</p>
<p>what what Sam what Sam what Sam Jacobs wants doesn&rsquo;t mean that Sam Jacobs gets to decide for</p>
<p>everybody else. And just because that he wants to live in a communist country, he can go and find</p>
<p>one. And the reality is like, you know, we just talked about alpha fold. Well, guess what, you</p>
<p>know, there&rsquo;s four of us on this on this podcast today, that over the next 20 or 30 years are more</p>
<p>than likely going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in protein design. And I don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>with any sense of shame. And I&rsquo;m glad that Stuart Butterfield made me, you know, a lot of money,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to go go back into the world in positive ways. And, you know, maybe if my</p>
<p>children are taught properly, they&rsquo;ll be able to take a small piece of that. And they&rsquo;ll decide</p>
<p>that, you know, there&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s important to them. But the reality is that</p>
<p>everybody should be allowed to make their own decisions. And I don&rsquo;t want somebody like him,</p>
<p>especially a 25 year old dipshit, telling me or my kids who even though they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>under the age of 15, are probably smarter than him what to do. David, when you read this article,</p>
<p>if you did read it, what were your thoughts? And especially in regards to parenting and thinking</p>
<p>about our own kids? Because I started thinking about like, Oh, my God, what if one of my</p>
<p>daughters wants to take her trust fund and just throw it into the wind? I really don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to comment. Wait, hold on. I just want to say one more thing. The part that&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>reasonable and that I respect is this, this 25 year old seems to have come to a decision.</p>
<p>What I find completely unreasonable, and, you know, just completely lathered with insecurity</p>
<p>is his need to then project it and say it has to be true for everybody else as well.</p>
<p>And the grand arcing statements of how it should never be just completely portrays,</p>
<p>you know, what we&rsquo;ve learned in how society functionally works. Like if you want democracy,</p>
<p>the only sort of economic philosophy that&rsquo;s been partnered with, with democracy to work well as</p>
<p>capitalism. And so if you want to change one, you&rsquo;re going to have to change the other.</p>
<p>And just the fact that, you know, with all of his education, the hundreds of millions of dollars,</p>
<p>you know, didn&rsquo;t get a course in civics to understand that is kind of sad.</p>
<p>I just before you go, David, I have to read one comment, because it&rsquo;s so deranged,</p>
<p>that it almost seems like it was part of a script to like some billions or secession.</p>
<p>heirs whose wealth have come from specific sources sometimes use that history to guide</p>
<p>their giving. That&rsquo;s the New York Times saying that Pierce de la Hunt, a 32 year old socialist,</p>
<p>anarchist, Marxist, communist, or all of the above, has a trust fund that was financed by</p>
<p>their former stepfather&rsquo;s outlet mall empire. When I and this is Mr. Mr. I&rsquo;m sorry, MX,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen that before. De la Hunt. How do you pronounce Max Hunt? How do you pronounce MX?</p>
<p>MX de la Hunt takes non gendered pronouns. Has anybody seen MX? I&rsquo;ve never seen that.</p>
<p>That was the first time. Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first for me. So I guess so you don&rsquo;t have to say Mr. or miss or miss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Latinx where you just can group a bunch of people into one thing. I got it.</p>
<p>This is what MX de la Hunt says. I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out how it&rsquo;s pronounced.</p>
<p>Maxis Hunt de la Hunt.</p>
<p>Taking a shot. Jason, you&rsquo;re not showing respect for his pronouns.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get canceled. It just is kind of hard to pronounce MX.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to laugh, but I need somebody to tell me how to pronounce MX.com.</p>
<p>But this is the quote that is so insane. When I think about outlet malls, and I think this is</p>
<p>what we all think about when we think about outlet malls. When I think about outlet malls,</p>
<p>I think about intersectional oppression. What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind,</p>
<p>Freeberg, when you think of an outlet mall? Oh, certainly it&rsquo;s intersectional oppression</p>
<p>or a subway. Look, can I just point out like the New York Times has become</p>
<p>a little bit sensationalist. If you were to ask statistically what percentage of people that are</p>
<p>inheriting wealth are going to be stupid like this, the answer would probably be pretty low.</p>
<p>But they find the one or two characters like this, and they build the story around them.</p>
<p>And then people extrapolate that as if that is the persona of the entire population of people</p>
<p>that are going to inherit some degree of wealth. And that becomes a story. And I&rsquo;m just so sick</p>
<p>of it. I don&rsquo;t read the New York Times anymore. And look, I love the New York Times. I would read</p>
<p>it every single day. I still have it on my phone. I still pay for my subscription. But I&rsquo;m so sick</p>
<p>of the narrative being written by the author&rsquo;s objective. And then they go and find one or two</p>
<p>facts that meet that narrative. And rather than speaking about it statistically and saying we</p>
<p>surveyed 100 people that were wealthy, this is how many. And if it was 60% of them saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go give away all my wealth and do crazy shit. Great. That&rsquo;s the story. But picking</p>
<p>an individual and building the narrative around that individual as if that is the</p>
<p>number David, but David, and that&rsquo;s the point. Like what they do is they don&rsquo;t even talk about</p>
<p>people who want to give their money away. What they do is they create these caricatures around</p>
<p>this like, judgment, judgment, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all about this like judgment. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>for example, I am it&rsquo;s virtue. It&rsquo;s like I am holier than everybody else because of these</p>
<p>decisions that I made. And I just find it so offensive. Now, here&rsquo;s Can I just tell you,</p>
<p>I had my physical last week, and I have a doctor in LA who&rsquo;s superb. And he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s in many ways</p>
<p>sort of a philosopher king to me. He&rsquo;s been incredibly important in my life. And, you know,</p>
<p>I talked to Regis, I talked to his name, his name is Christian Renna at lifespan medicine. But</p>
<p>anyways, and here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re and I talked to Chris about raising kids. And Chris has seen,</p>
<p>you know, 1000s of people over the course of his, you know, journey as a primary care physician,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s seen the kids of these folks and etc. And, you know, he boiled it down to me. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, your job as a parent is to make sure that your children have incredible tools,</p>
<p>married with incredible habits. And so some of these things are very simple, like food,</p>
<p>and you know how to eat and self care and exercise. But some of these things are really important,</p>
<p>which is a worldview, empathy, and he uses this word, which is called awareness. And awareness</p>
<p>is this idea that you understand the world around you. And that&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult</p>
<p>thing for parents to be able to teach their kids. But it seems like if you could give them that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s independent of anything other than time and care, right? It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rich or you&rsquo;re poor, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether you&rsquo;re black or you&rsquo;re white, you can</p>
<p>really teach the concept of awareness and empathy. And then the other thing that he taught me was,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a really big difference between folks like you meet meaning guys like me,</p>
<p>who grew up poor, and who are focused on the generation of money, right, meaning making money.</p>
<p>And some of you make it some of you don&rsquo;t, but you&rsquo;re living in this existential threat that</p>
<p>you feel is hanging over you. And so you go out and you make it and a lot of it is driven by</p>
<p>this insecurity you&rsquo;ve had since you were young. But make no mistake, your children&rsquo;s lives is</p>
<p>harder than yours. And it&rsquo;s about the utilization of money. And whether they want to give it away,</p>
<p>or whether they want to use it, you have a responsibility to teach them whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving them $1, $1 million, or $1 billion. And this is where I think somewhere along the way,</p>
<p>these kids as parents, you know, may or may not have done the best. Maybe they did the best they</p>
<p>could. But somewhere along the way, these gaps are are obvious, at least in the telling of the</p>
<p>article. And this is where I go back to, if you&rsquo;re really going to talk about something like this,</p>
<p>which actually is quite important, because again, we&rsquo;re going to go through the most enormous wealth</p>
<p>transfer in the history of the world in the next 20 years $30 trillion that could so talk about</p>
<p>that if if enough people took their inheritance and decided to eradicate student debt, it would</p>
<p>be 3% of what&rsquo;s going to be inherited over the next 20 years. Think about it. So obviously,</p>
<p>you can do some incredible things. But it&rsquo;s not framed in the right way. It doesn&rsquo;t promote the</p>
<p>right kind of discussion. And all it is is salacious reporting that makes these kids look</p>
<p>like caricatures. And by the way, remember that money today is invested somewhere. So to pull that</p>
<p>3% out would have a kind of cripple kind of rippling and kind of probably deleterious effect</p>
<p>on on lower No, no, forget about that. It&rsquo;s factories family. But this is this is my point</p>
<p>also is I think that there&rsquo;s a responsibility to the stewards of capital, right? They may be you</p>
<p>can call them wealthy all you want, but they really are the people that pull the strings</p>
<p>are where money&rsquo;s moving. And there&rsquo;s, I think, you know, to your point, kind of a degree of</p>
<p>responsibility that inevitably has to kind of sit with this, this group.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with it is, if they just want to give their money away to a charity that they</p>
<p>thought was worthy, and they&rsquo;ve been they were willing to live like, you know, monks or something</p>
<p>and not need money, that&rsquo;d be fine. You know, we could respect that. But the reason why they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>such a hurry to get rid of this wealth is because they feel like money itself is ill gotten that</p>
<p>wealth itself is, is by definition, ill gotten, it must have come from at the expense of somebody</p>
<p>else, right? You only could have gotten that wealth by ripping people off. And that is the</p>
<p>thing that that&rsquo;s the idea that&rsquo;s really pernicious about this sort of like socialism movement,</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t really understand that the way capitalism works, you only get rich by selling</p>
<p>something to somebody that they want, that makes their life better, right? I mean, all of us are</p>
<p>engaged in the creation of new technologies and new products. And that makes the world better.</p>
<p>And people are willing to pay for that. And that&rsquo;s what creates value. And, and that&rsquo;s what creates</p>
<p>wealth. And it&rsquo;s really just kind of sad that people, you know, it goes beyond this article</p>
<p>on these trust fund kids, but this whole condemnation of capitalism and this attack on</p>
<p>any, you know, on billionaires or whatever. The problem with it is it doesn&rsquo;t recognize the way</p>
<p>that value is created for everybody. Can I give you a quote from Walter Williams,</p>
<p>who just passed away, who&rsquo;s a very famous economist. Prior to capitalism, the way people</p>
<p>amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man capitalism made</p>
<p>it possible to become wealthy by serving your fellow man. And that&rsquo;s really true. And some</p>
<p>are along the way, folks, folks have lost the script and have all of a sudden gone back to pre</p>
<p>historic capitalist times. And I think that we don&rsquo;t have enough good examples</p>
<p>of constructive capitalism that prove that this is not a bad word.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I love the Walter Williams quote. Just to give another example,</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos just gave $10 billion to climate change.</p>
<p>And you know what? Teddy, what&rsquo;s the kid&rsquo;s name? Teddy Schaefer or something like that. The</p>
<p>journalist has been writing him on Twitter. I think he works for Vox or something like</p>
<p>they have basically been attacking Bezos since he made the announcement that he hasn&rsquo;t done enough.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like $10 billion is the largest contribution ever made to a single cause. I</p>
<p>mean, obviously, Bill Gates, how did he do that? Right. And how did he do that? Because he created</p>
<p>Amazon, which has created enormous value for all of us. Imagine if one of these kids in the article,</p>
<p>instead of just giving their money away, by the way, it looks like there&rsquo;s a bunch of organizations</p>
<p>that have sprung up to scam these kids out of their trust fund. It&rsquo;s sort of, you know,</p>
<p>a fool and their money are soon parted. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of scam artists who are trying to</p>
<p>scam these kids. But yeah, I mean, they&rsquo;re definitely getting scammed. But imagine if</p>
<p>instead of just getting scammed out of their money, they were to use it to create a business</p>
<p>that created a new product or technology that serve people, then maybe they could turn that</p>
<p>30 million into 10 billion like Bezos did. And if they lost it, they would have done it in the</p>
<p>pursuit of something really grand. And so nobody would actually- Instead of virtue signaling.</p>
<p>Instead of virtue signaling on the New York Times. Yeah, like these guys were so glad to be in the</p>
<p>New York Times to dunk on capitalists and literally dunk on their own parents. Think about that. You</p>
<p>hate your parents so much, you have to go to the New York Times and tell them how much you hate</p>
<p>them. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how this changes- Well, by the way, speaking of virtue signaling</p>
<p>in the New York Times, can we talk about the New York Times writing that hit piece on Coinbase?</p>
<p>All right. I mean, if you want to go there, I mean, this is the third rail of the podcast,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve been talking about Brian Armstrong. Just to set the table here,</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong wrote a memo. He said, no politics at work-</p>
<p>By the way, Jekyll, I just posted an image for Nick to put up here just to-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s a code 13 at Saks again. No, this is not a code 13. It&rsquo;s to reinforce</p>
<p>your point about the virtue of capitalism. This kind of dates back to, these are three images,</p>
<p>three charts from the year 1500 to today. Energy use has grown 115 times.</p>
<p>Well, so this is basically a measure of population consumption and production, right? And so</p>
<p>the capitalist incentive has driven the ability, while population has grown 14x over the last 500</p>
<p>years, it&rsquo;s driven a nearly 10x increment in what is available for humans to consume</p>
<p>per capita during that period of time. I mean, think about that. That was driven entirely by</p>
<p>industry. And so industry has enabled, and production has increased by 240x. So we have</p>
<p>a surplus of goods on planet Earth and a surplus of access to goods because of the capitalist</p>
<p>incentive over the last 500 years. And whose right is it to say that that was wrong?</p>
<p>And all of the people that are employed by it and live within that mechanism-</p>
<p>And who are no longer living in poverty, who are no longer slaves.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, 50,000 people can virtue signal because they&rsquo;re sitting in their warm</p>
<p>homes in America telling everybody else to fuck off. I mean, I find it kind of a joke. I mean,</p>
<p>I would like you to go and live where I was supposed to live before I emigrated.</p>
<p>Right. Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>No heater, no roof, no food, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what these kids should do. They should go to North Korea.</p>
<p>Come to Sri Lanka, I can show you. You go to an outhouse, okay? You sit there,</p>
<p>you squat to go to the bathroom, okay? There&rsquo;s no fucking three-ply bamboo, press-free toilet</p>
<p>paper to deal with. You literally clean yourself with your hand. You brush your teeth with coal.</p>
<p>I remember we used to brush our teeth with fucking coal, okay? We have a well for water.</p>
<p>And so you have all these people in these situations where all we wanted</p>
<p>was to just give a chance to run the race. And the people that were born with a silver</p>
<p>spoon in their mouth who had the chance to run the race turns around and tells guys like me,</p>
<p>no, you can&rsquo;t, and it fucking infuriates me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to blow up the racetrack, by the way. I want to just get rid of the entire-</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, fuck you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serious fuck you to these. They profited and they benefited from democracy and capitalism,</p>
<p>and now they want to revert back to a system where everybody who&rsquo;s in that system-</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand-</p>
<p>Is trying to get into this system.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand what feudalism is because there are so many layers removed through their</p>
<p>fucking filtered lenses and country clubs and bullshit vacations and all this crap</p>
<p>that they have no idea what it&rsquo;s like. And I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>I am first generation of having escaped that shit, and I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with it.</p>
<p>But the point is capitalism has allowed not just the US but many other countries to change their</p>
<p>course in life. Stephen Pigners, for all of the controversy he creates, his books on</p>
<p>what humans have really achieved during this great era of capitalism and industrialism and</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;ve changed our course on planet Earth, improved human health, improved longevity,</p>
<p>improved access to calories, improved access to shelter, to medicine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all because of an incentive, a market-based incentive system.</p>
<p>And it is very, very powerful. It is the most powerful force we know as a species,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s allowed this incredible acceleration, exponential acceleration of possibility</p>
<p>for our species. Also from the article, a great quote, Elizabeth Baldwin,</p>
<p>a 34-year-old democratic socialist from Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>She plans to keep enough of her inheritance to buy an apartment and raise a family enjoying</p>
<p>the sort of pleasant middle-class existence denied to many people of color in the United States.</p>
<p>What does, I mean, that&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know. I just, I don&rsquo;t see, let&rsquo;s just move on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so dumb.</p>
<p>They see the world in a zero-sum way where, you know, anything they have means that somebody else</p>
<p>must have, it must have been taken away from somebody else. They don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>the way that value is created by an exchange and by people creating new things.</p>
<p>And, you know, and that&rsquo;s what technology is all about, you know, it&rsquo;s creating new things.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a time when everybody didn&rsquo;t have access to clean water. Now we</p>
<p>take that for granted. There&rsquo;s a time when everybody didn&rsquo;t have access to affordable</p>
<p>food and time and electricity.</p>
<p>And by the way, look at how we started.</p>
<p>All of this is driven by capitalism.</p>
<p>And look at how we started the conversation today. AlphaFold, I think, is the realization</p>
<p>of one of the greatest capitalist enterprises in history, if not the greatest, you know, alphabet.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still getting started.</p>
<p>And the output of that is going to be an incredible new tool</p>
<p>for drug discovery that is going to extend human lifespan in an incredible way.</p>
<p>There was a window of time where folks who are really, really good at bitching and complaining</p>
<p>had a window of opportunity to bitch and complain.</p>
<p>And what happened was they were not able to seize power.</p>
<p>And then just in the last few months, literally, I think we are nailing that coffin shut.</p>
<p>Because as you said, David, you&rsquo;re going to have to all of a sudden, like,</p>
<p>look at companies like Google and look at things like AlphaFold and reject them.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how people do because everyone will need something that that company will create</p>
<p>now and that AlphaFold will be responsible for.</p>
<p>We are all going to need a vaccine.</p>
<p>These are all coming from for-profit companies that thrived on top of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>All of it was funded by past drug profits from other things.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re going to have to really look at ourselves in the mirror and say,</p>
<p>did we not want that?</p>
<p>Did we want to just die on the street to prove a point?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anybody actually wants that.</p>
<p>I mean, what is the ultimate criticism of Amazon?</p>
<p>They made iPhone chargers $5 instead of being $40.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t actually complain about Amazon on the one hand,</p>
<p>complain about no action on climate change on the other,</p>
<p>complain about this, complain about that, complain about the other thing,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just a fucking whiner.</p>
<p>And nobody wants a whiner around because they&rsquo;re not additive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not useful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t learn anything from a whiner.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, looking at the New York Times versus Coinbase, the foul New York Times fake news.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m just channeling Trump there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Foul New York Times fake news.</p>
<p>Well, talk about whining.</p>
<p>This is more virtue signaling whining by the New York Times.</p>
<p>And actually, look, this was clearly a hit piece because they don&rsquo;t like Brian Armstrong&rsquo;s</p>
<p>decision to make Coinbase an apolitical workplace.</p>
<p>If any workplace has chosen to be political, it&rsquo;s the New York Times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples of that.</p>
<p>They ran Barry Weiss out of there.</p>
<p>They ran Barry Weiss out of the newsroom.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the most-</p>
<p>They ran the editor page out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, they ran James Bennett out of there for publishing an op-ed by Tom Cotton.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>He got kicked out.</p>
<p>He got forced to resign because he published one op-ed by a Republican senator.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the most closed-minded group, the most closed-minded political workplace.</p>
<p>And here they are lecturing a Silicon Valley company that, in their view, isn&rsquo;t tolerant</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And it was obvious that it was a hit piece.</p>
<p>The examples in the article were years old.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even reported to HR as violations at the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s people cooking up things that weren&rsquo;t reported as problems at the time.</p>
<p>But the really interesting thing about the story, I think, is the way Coinbase reacted</p>
<p>to it by preemptively announcing that it was coming, which really made the New York Times</p>
<p>reporters really irate.</p>
<p>You know, they called it extremely unprofessional.</p>
<p>All of the reporters were upset, and they threatened that they would no longer‚Äîthe</p>
<p>journalist said, if you guys are going to front-run our stories, we are not going to</p>
<p>call you when we have a story.</p>
<p>And I responded to that, and I was like, are you serious?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re literally going to lose what little integrity you have left about fact</p>
<p>checking because somebody wrote a preemptive blog post about a story which was a hit piece?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this about Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for him for making a stand.</p>
<p>I think every CEO has that, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad that, at the end of the day, the employees at Coinbase were given a humane</p>
<p>way of making a decision to be on the same page with him or not.</p>
<p>I will also say that I thought that essay was not well-written, and that, given the</p>
<p>chance, I could have rewritten that for him in a much better way.</p>
<p>I maintained this the whole time.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s in the right here.</p>
<p>Wrap it up, David.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think.</p>
<p>Well, okay, that&rsquo;s interesting that Chamath is ‚Äì it&rsquo;s interesting to hear your support</p>
<p>for Brian.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve talked about ‚Äì this has become a recurring topic on the pod.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think the important thing is the way that I think the tech community fought</p>
<p>back against this hit piece.</p>
<p>And it was, like you said, Jason, the front-running of the story.</p>
<p>Somebody ‚Äì a WAG on Twitter had a great comment saying ‚Äì basically said, you know,</p>
<p>I try to walk up ‚Äì I agree with the New York Times on this.</p>
<p>I try to walk up to somebody and kick them in the nuts, and they covered their groin.</p>
<p>You know, how dare they?</p>
<p>You know, how unprofessional of them.</p>
<p>It was a slow-motion kick in the nuts.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming Sunday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Wednesday.</p>
<p>But on Sunday, we&rsquo;re kicking you on the nuts.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the New York Times ‚Äì the Coinbase just covered his groin so the New York Times</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t kick him in the nuts.</p>
<p>And of course, the reporters all went hysterical about that.</p>
<p>But it was a really brilliant PR tactic by Coinbase because what it did is it almost,</p>
<p>like, released a spike protein.</p>
<p>You know, by sort of pre-announcing the New York Times story, it created this spike protein</p>
<p>that trained the immune system of Silicon Valley to be ready for this pathogenic New</p>
<p>York Times story.</p>
<p>And the story just really fell flat.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was ‚Äì and they did the same thing with the Away CEO.</p>
<p>She was too hard on people in Slack.</p>
<p>All of these stories, to go full circle, involve some leak from a Slack room.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a CEO or you&rsquo;re managing anybody, don&rsquo;t have any difficult or legal issues</p>
<p>discussed on Slack.</p>
<p>Go for a walk with somebody.</p>
<p>Talk to them face-to-face because you&rsquo;re going to get destroyed.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen, everybody.</p>
<p>This has been another amazing episode.</p>
<p>We have 10 more stories we wanted to get to that we weren&rsquo;t able to get to.</p>
<p>But while we were doing this, I asked my crack team ‚Äì sorry, at the syndicate.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>To set up thesyndicate.com slash all in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re doing a syndicate.</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to figure out how to do something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do something to let the people who listen invest alongside us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to figure it out in 2021 at some point.</p>
<p>But you have to write a review on iTunes.</p>
<p>No, you just got to sign up.</p>
<p>Just got to sign up at thesyndicate.com slash all in.</p>
<p>If we do a folding protein company or a unicorn in the ISA space,</p>
<p>maybe everybody who listens to the all-in podcast gets to wet their beak for the Rain</p>
<p>Van Davis sack.</p>
<p>Wet the beak.</p>
<p>Wet the beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>Wet the beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wet my beak is like the merch.</p>
<p>The t-shirt guy that listens to us, we love you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a code 13, obviously.</p>
<p>But wet your beak or wet the beak.</p>
<p>We have to figure out which one&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>I think we have a new tagline for the pod.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak and code 13.</p>
<p>These are great merch opportunities for anybody who wants to go do merch.</p>
<p>You can go do merch on your own.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in the merch business.</p>
<p>Put it up on your own website.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>So for Bestie Rain Man, the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya and the queen of quinoa himself,</p>
<p>Metro Mile founder, spacker, piper, laying pipe and spacks everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jason Kalaganis for the besties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you next time, which could be in a week or a month.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>On the all-in podcast.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
