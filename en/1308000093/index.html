    <p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And instead, we open sourced it to the fans,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Please welcome Tandis.</p>
<p>Hi, everyone.</p>
<p>So what I want to talk about today</p>
<p>is the problem that I&rsquo;m obsessed with, which is bad customer</p>
<p>service in health care.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to start out by walking you</p>
<p>through a day at the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It can look a little bit like this.</p>
<p>You have to start out by making an appointment.</p>
<p>So you call in.</p>
<p>You talk to someone very unpleasant on the phone.</p>
<p>They put you on hold.</p>
<p>You wait.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bad hold music.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re waiting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re waiting.</p>
<p>They come back.</p>
<p>You go back and forth a little bit on your calendars.</p>
<p>You get an appointment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in 21 days.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 21 days later.</p>
<p>You go to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Someone very unpleasant checks you in at the front desk.</p>
<p>You sit down.</p>
<p>Super depressing waiting room.</p>
<p>Bad wall art.</p>
<p>Very old issues of Parenting Magazine.</p>
<p>Smells like Purell in there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>This is your hangout for a little bit now.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s maybe 30 or 40 minutes later.</p>
<p>Someone calls you back.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, they&rsquo;re very unpleasant.</p>
<p>They take you back to the exam room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very small.</p>
<p>Blad fluorescent lighting everywhere.</p>
<p>They take your vitals.</p>
<p>They hand you, essentially, a sheet of printer paper.</p>
<p>They tell you to change into this.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re in sort of a secondary holding chamber.</p>
<p>Except this time, you can hear the doctor in the other room.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying, hey, it&rsquo;s so great to see you.</p>
<p>And so you know they&rsquo;re just getting started in there,</p>
<p>even though your appointment was an hour ago at this point.</p>
<p>Pull up your phone.</p>
<p>You start to go through your little question list.</p>
<p>Got up the courage to ask everything you came in to ask.</p>
<p>And then finally, the doctor knocks like you could possibly</p>
<p>still be changing.</p>
<p>He comes in, does a little small talk with you.</p>
<p>He goes and sits down, starts asking you some questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re maybe like eight minutes into the appointment</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, OK, also, I have some questions.</p>
<p>And you pull up your little question list on your phone.</p>
<p>And you get through maybe like two or three of these questions.</p>
<p>And then the doctor starts to give you a look</p>
<p>like, let&rsquo;s wrap this up.</p>
<p>And so you wrap it up.</p>
<p>You ask three questions.</p>
<p>The appointment is over.</p>
<p>You go outside.</p>
<p>You check out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, they&rsquo;ll tell you how much you owe.</p>
<p>If not, you will just find out later in the mail.</p>
<p>So my guess is that maybe many of you in this audience</p>
<p>have a concierge doctor.</p>
<p>But most of us have had some iteration of this experience</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>There are a lot of terrible things about our health care</p>
<p>system, but the one I want to complain about specifically today</p>
<p>is why the customer service at the point at which you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>consuming the health care is so appallingly bad.</p>
<p>And when I refer to customer service, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything that touches the patient experience</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re going to the doctor.</p>
<p>So a long wait time is as much bad customer service</p>
<p>as the unfriendly front desk person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this really great quote that I</p>
<p>love from Bill Gurley, prolific investor,</p>
<p>and my relationship hall pass.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t know he was going to be here.</p>
<p>The US health care market is the least customer centric</p>
<p>of any customer service industry.</p>
<p>We are so numb to the pain that we rarely object or complain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of what I think is so crazy about this,</p>
<p>is that we kind of just take it.</p>
<p>And so that got me curious to explore three questions</p>
<p>I want to go through with you here today.</p>
<p>Number one, why are things so bad?</p>
<p>How did they get this way?</p>
<p>Number two, why should we care that things are so bad?</p>
<p>And number three, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a little something we can do to make it better?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with, why are things so bad?</p>
<p>A big part of this is our customer service problem</p>
<p>is really more of a consumer service problem.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is patients</p>
<p>are consuming the health care, but they&rsquo;re not exactly</p>
<p>the customer in the traditional free market sense of the term.</p>
<p>So who is?</p>
<p>The US health care system, as we know,</p>
<p>is an employer-sponsored model.</p>
<p>This was not very well thought out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a World War II relic</p>
<p>that came from a national mandated wage freeze in 1942.</p>
<p>And we kind of just kept going with it.</p>
<p>And now today, the doctor is not getting out</p>
<p>of bed in the morning for your $15 co-pay.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really making their money off</p>
<p>of the major stakeholders in the industry who</p>
<p>are the employers and the insurance companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the payers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the real customers in this story.</p>
<p>And doctors don&rsquo;t love this either, by the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s major burnout in the medical community.</p>
<p>But when you play this all the way out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left with misaligned incentives between physicians</p>
<p>and patients.</p>
<p>Physicians in the traditional fee-for-service model,</p>
<p>which is our predominant model today,</p>
<p>where physicians are paid per patient encounter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incentivized by volume and not by quality</p>
<p>and not by good health outcomes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no surprise that practices are not designed</p>
<p>to cater to the patient.</p>
<p>And once that becomes the norm, it becomes the culture.</p>
<p>Every doctor&rsquo;s office can get away with it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re left with these two really bad stats.</p>
<p>The first one is, in primary care specifically,</p>
<p>the average NPS for a provider is three.</p>
<p>That is so embarrassing.</p>
<p>Number two, 96% of patient complaints</p>
<p>are about the service itself.</p>
<p>Only 4% are about the care delivered.</p>
<p>So patients are really noticing how bad the customer service is.</p>
<p>And yet, to go back to our earlier point,</p>
<p>patients have this sort of Stockholm syndrome</p>
<p>when it comes to going to the doctor specifically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll request a non-talkative Uber</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t feel like chatting with the driver,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll leave a very scathing Yelp review for a restaurant.</p>
<p>But when it comes to this service,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re not an easy-to-please generation,</p>
<p>we become very submissive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the most important service</p>
<p>across any service industry.</p>
<p>So this is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>And why should we care that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having such a bad time at the doctor&rsquo;s office?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because bad service is bad for our health.</p>
<p>So good medicine is a partnership</p>
<p>between a patient who&rsquo;s coming in with real information</p>
<p>on how they&rsquo;re feeling and then a physician who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming in with real expertise to bring to that information.</p>
<p>And they work together.</p>
<p>But if the patient is feeling very anxious and exhausted,</p>
<p>and the doctor is feeling very rushed and dismissive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left with losing a bunch of really important information</p>
<p>that you need to make nuanced diagnostic and treatment</p>
<p>plans.</p>
<p>So to give you an example, doctors</p>
<p>are far more likely to prescribe antibiotics in the afternoon</p>
<p>than they are in the morning for the same patient</p>
<p>with the same issues, because they&rsquo;re just running late</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dealing with decision fatigue.</p>
<p>If you leave with anything from this talk,</p>
<p>it should be to make morning appointments.</p>
<p>And then patients, on the other hand, know all of this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve felt this before.</p>
<p>And so what many of them end up doing</p>
<p>is deferring treatment altogether.</p>
<p>So patients feel like it&rsquo;s a hassle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not getting anything out of it.</p>
<p>They will just text their med school friend.</p>
<p>Health care has a patient buy-in problem,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve made the experience of going</p>
<p>to the doctor&rsquo;s office so bad that we only go</p>
<p>when we absolutely have to go.</p>
<p>And what do we lose when we go when we only absolutely</p>
<p>have to go?</p>
<p>Preventive care.</p>
<p>And preventive care is really the reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad that we&rsquo;re not going to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>We lose out on going when things are early.</p>
<p>We lose out on all the upstream, life-saving, cost-saving</p>
<p>benefits of prevention.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to hit you with three stats on that.</p>
<p>The first one is 40% of annual deaths</p>
<p>caused by the top five causes of death in the US</p>
<p>are preventable with good preventive care.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, for whatever that&rsquo;s worth to you,</p>
<p>avoidable chronic disease accounts</p>
<p>for 75% of our health care spend.</p>
<p>And finally, on the other hand, patients</p>
<p>with a PCP, a primary care doctor,</p>
<p>spend 33% less on health care overall,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re front-loading that spend toward prevention.</p>
<p>So bad service is bad for our health.</p>
<p>What can we do about it?</p>
<p>The good news is this.</p>
<p>We are starting to see more and more practices</p>
<p>shift towards models that incentivize physicians to care</p>
<p>about good customer service.</p>
<p>So there are two models we can use here</p>
<p>to change the compensation model to allow physicians</p>
<p>to have time and space to think about service.</p>
<p>So the first one is direct-to-consumer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s making the patient the customer again</p>
<p>in this scenario.</p>
<p>And the second one is leveraging value-based care models,</p>
<p>where the insurers are reimbursing based on quality</p>
<p>instead of over volume.</p>
<p>So in that case, the insurer is still the customer,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re now rewarding a different outcome here.</p>
<p>So those are kind of the two options that we can leverage.</p>
<p>But as we can see, we have the tools that we need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really now about shifting norms in the health care</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>And the industry is very clunky, and it&rsquo;s red tapey,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of crotchety at times.</p>
<p>And so the change might feel a little bit slower</p>
<p>than it does in other industries.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re starting to see more and more companies push back.</p>
<p>And as they push back, patient expectations change.</p>
<p>We start to expect more out of our health care.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re starting to treat health care the way</p>
<p>we treat any other service that we interact with.</p>
<p>And we start to say goodbye to that Stockholm syndrome era.</p>
<p>But as we move towards these models that</p>
<p>change the incentives for physicians,</p>
<p>we still need a framework to think about, OK,</p>
<p>how do we get that good customer service?</p>
<p>How do we actually get the patient buy-in?</p>
<p>How do we get people to want to go back to the doctor&rsquo;s office?</p>
<p>Because doctors and hospital administrators</p>
<p>are not used to thinking about this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not used to training on customer service or bedside</p>
<p>manner.</p>
<p>So we need to look to another industry, which</p>
<p>is the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>So I brought you on this journey here today to tell you,</p>
<p>we need to be stealing from the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>They have figured this out already.</p>
<p>They know how to treat people like people.</p>
<p>They know how to provide human-to-human service,</p>
<p>which is ultimately today what health care still is.</p>
<p>So I really think this definition of hospitality</p>
<p>from Danny Meyer is really great.</p>
<p>Esteemed restaurateur, my other relationship hall pass.</p>
<p>Hospitality is present when something happens for you.</p>
<p>It is absent when something happens to you.</p>
<p>So we want health care that happens for patients</p>
<p>and not to patients, really Michelin-worthy,</p>
<p>or at least very effusive Yelp review-worthy health care.</p>
<p>And I want to share a few ideas on how</p>
<p>I think we can get there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the co-founder of a primary care membership</p>
<p>service called the Lanby.</p>
<p>And we do what we call a health care hospitality</p>
<p>training with all of our team members, all of our providers.</p>
<p>And I want to share a few central tenets</p>
<p>from that training with you that I</p>
<p>think are the ones that can be applied into any practice.</p>
<p>They can be implemented at very low cost</p>
<p>and can really start to shift the norms</p>
<p>and shift the culture, which is what we need.</p>
<p>Some of these may seem obvious, but they&rsquo;re not in health care.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>These are my top five.</p>
<p>Number one, follow the golden rule.</p>
<p>Patients are entrusting us with their most precious resource,</p>
<p>which is their health.</p>
<p>Treat them the way you would want</p>
<p>to be treated at the doctor or you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>want your family to be treated.</p>
<p>Number two, set clear expectations.</p>
<p>This is not a subway track.</p>
<p>Nobody wins when we hold information</p>
<p>like running a few minutes late to ourselves.</p>
<p>Number three, be a good, active, empathetic listener.</p>
<p>Ask good questions to get good clues.</p>
<p>Treat every case like it&rsquo;s a medical investigation.</p>
<p>If someone didn&rsquo;t think something was important,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have brought it up with us.</p>
<p>Another Danny Meyer line, be an agent, not a gatekeeper.</p>
<p>So an agent lets people in.</p>
<p>A gatekeeper builds up barriers to keep people out.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be that kind of practice.</p>
<p>If a patient has a good reason to be asking</p>
<p>you to break one of our rules and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an easy way to break it within the bounds of the law,</p>
<p>then just break it.</p>
<p>Finally, for extra credit, surprise and delight.</p>
<p>How can we make this the best interaction of a patient&rsquo;s day</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re going through something really challenging?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the fun puzzle of applying hospitality</p>
<p>into the health care context is finding a way</p>
<p>to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>How can we remember something about someone</p>
<p>and make them feel seen and make them feel like, yeah,</p>
<p>I want to come back to the doctor&rsquo;s office?</p>
<p>All right, I don&rsquo;t have a super punchy ending here,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just going to wrap this up with health care</p>
<p>hospitality treats patients the way</p>
<p>they deserve to be treated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all patients at some point.</p>
<p>And when that point comes, the stakes</p>
<p>will feel inherently high.</p>
<p>Too high to get worse service than you</p>
<p>would at your favorite restaurant.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I think the thing that struck me about our dysfunctional system</p>
<p>is the Bill Gurley quote, and then what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There is no customer.</p>
<p>And how does that change over time in America?</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re doing with your company is part of it.</p>
<p>So how do we change that in Americans&rsquo; perception?</p>
<p>Because I got my knee done, and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know how much it cost.</p>
<p>And then I found out just cleaning up my meniscus</p>
<p>was $60,000, and that was like, how much?</p>
<p>$60,000 10 years ago for a meniscus surgery in New York.</p>
<p>And then somebody said, that should cost like $10,000.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no menu.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to a restaurant.</p>
<p>You know when you go to the restaurant in Italy,</p>
<p>like the ones you go to, and there&rsquo;s no prices?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>I love those.</p>
<p>Yeah, you love it, and then you hand me the check.</p>
<p>We were in Vegas that time.</p>
<p>So how do Americans start changing how they perceive this?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the problem, is it not?</p>
<p>Definitely part of the problem is that we all are kind of just</p>
<p>OK with it and assume that this is this industry where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not supposed to know the prices until afterwards.</p>
<p>No other industry works this way.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t put up with it anywhere else.</p>
<p>And so I think direct-to-consumer models</p>
<p>play a huge role in getting patients to think,</p>
<p>oh, I can treat this like other services.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re not annoying consumers in other ways.</p>
<p>We already are.</p>
<p>And so we just need to apply that same annoying attitude</p>
<p>to health care.</p>
<p>And then by leveraging direct-to-consumer models,</p>
<p>part of this is getting on higher deductible plans.</p>
<p>So we start to treat our dollars more like normal dollars,</p>
<p>putting money into HSAs and FSAs.</p>
<p>It gets us to start thinking more</p>
<p>like a traditional customer and think about where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re spending our money.</p>
<p>And we see that a little bit with direct-to-consumer drug</p>
<p>companies, HIMS, HERS, GetRome, and all the stuff</p>
<p>that Freeberg uses to get ready for battle.</p>
<p>David, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Your hair looks great.</p>
<p>Just to prepare for war.</p>
<p>Those are a start, right?</p>
<p>People are now.</p>
<p>Just say nice things from now on.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>But this is part of it that people are saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so dysfunctional to go to the doctor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so dysfunctional to go to my insurance company.</p>
<p>For certain things, I&rsquo;m just going</p>
<p>to go on a website and order.</p>
<p>That is part of the frustration, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That gives you a little taste of it.</p>
<p>And then alternatively, if you don&rsquo;t want to go to the doctor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go to Urgent Care, which has</p>
<p>much more of an easy pricing menu in many cases</p>
<p>that you can look at.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re starting to get a taste of it.</p>
<p>And I think patient expectations will change.</p>
<p>And doctors will have to follow suit.</p>
<p>We tend to index the quality of American health care</p>
<p>when you look at the average life expectancy.</p>
<p>First, you do men, women.</p>
<p>And then you look at white men versus black men</p>
<p>versus brown men, white women versus black women, et cetera.</p>
<p>And white men have always sort of been the standard bearer.</p>
<p>And then this odd thing has happened</p>
<p>over the last three or four years</p>
<p>where their life expectancy has started</p>
<p>to get worse and worse as our percentage share of health care</p>
<p>expenses, as a percentage of GDP, have gone up.</p>
<p>And everybody gets up in arms because they&rsquo;re like, well,</p>
<p>wait a minute.</p>
<p>Something is clearly so structurally broken</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re spending 15%, 20%, 30% a year increasing</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re dying now under the age of 80,</p>
<p>where this thing should be a thing where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living to 100.</p>
<p>Why exactly is that thing happening?</p>
<p>I can understand where you could say maybe it&rsquo;s segregated</p>
<p>to minority men or women or something.</p>
<p>But this is not.</p>
<p>This is basically everybody.</p>
<p>So why are we dying sooner as we spend more?</p>
<p>Yeah, because we&rsquo;re also increasingly</p>
<p>spending on a lot of things that kill us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re overspending on health care</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re spending on things that kill us.</p>
<p>And then our health care gets very expensive</p>
<p>because we have terrible, terrible lifestyles.</p>
<p>And everyone is drinking way too much across all communities.</p>
<p>Everybody is eating totally processed foods.</p>
<p>These are becoming more and more readily available,</p>
<p>increasingly so every year.</p>
<p>And so, yes, in the very upper echelons,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of a movement towards wellness and more</p>
<p>holistic lifestyle.</p>
<p>But that has not really swept the nation yet.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re all living really, really unhealthy lives,</p>
<p>not caring about our preventive health,</p>
<p>and then spending a lot on health care down the line.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s really not.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t outrun our lifestyle.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, which is not our fault.</p>
<p>I mean, corporations make it very, very difficult</p>
<p>to live a healthy lifestyle in the US.</p>
<p>And do you find examples of countries</p>
<p>that have gotten population-level health</p>
<p>issues right, whether it&rsquo;s with respect to costs or outcomes,</p>
<p>where you say that is directionally something</p>
<p>that we can learn?</p>
<p>No, I have no good answer to that question</p>
<p>because every company besides the US</p>
<p>thinks it has the best health care system.</p>
<p>But then any time I talk to anybody in one</p>
<p>of those countries, like I was speaking to people in Canada</p>
<p>the other week, and they hate their health care</p>
<p>and think it&rsquo;s the worst thing ever.</p>
<p>And they wait eight weeks to get UTI medication.</p>
<p>And so, A, I just think it&rsquo;s too hard to compare</p>
<p>our unwieldy country to other systems.</p>
<p>And B, I don&rsquo;t even know people who are</p>
<p>that happy with other systems.</p>
<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t have a good answer.</p>
<p>How much of a role do you think Medicare, Medicaid, CMS</p>
<p>can do to break the logjam versus waiting</p>
<p>for politicians to pass legislation like Obamacare</p>
<p>to try to reorient what&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>I think it really is both.</p>
<p>I think that HHS is playing a huge role</p>
<p>in trying to get more and more value-based care</p>
<p>models through Medicare.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re making a huge push to do that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s slow and clunky.</p>
<p>But I think they have the right idea.</p>
<p>They want us to move towards a value-based care model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about mental health recently,</p>
<p>seeing what we&rsquo;ve seen during the pandemic,</p>
<p>a lot of young people or kids having these two years alone,</p>
<p>and what the second-order, third-order effects of that.</p>
<p>And just trying to get consensus in America around health care</p>
<p>is very hard.</p>
<p>But I think since we&rsquo;ve all suffered</p>
<p>some degree of mental health over this COVID break, which</p>
<p>I think drove a lot of people crazy</p>
<p>and created a lot of anxiety, is there any way for us</p>
<p>to think about universal health care</p>
<p>but not have to have this nationwide discussion of all</p>
<p>or nothing?</p>
<p>And I was just thinking, mental health</p>
<p>is something that everybody can appreciate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that expensive to deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surgery.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just agree as a country</p>
<p>that anybody who wants to talk to a therapist or counselor</p>
<p>will be able to do it for a sliding scale or a very</p>
<p>small amount of money and maybe be</p>
<p>able to just chip off one piece of the puzzle</p>
<p>and say, you know what?</p>
<p>Therapy will be $50 flat rate.</p>
<p>The country will pick up the other $50 or $150,</p>
<p>whatever it is, to get this done.</p>
<p>And maybe you could just speak about mental health</p>
<p>as a larger issue, because it does</p>
<p>seem to have so many downstream effects in terms</p>
<p>of our physical health.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve thought about this a lot at the LAMBEE</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve tried to figure out</p>
<p>a way to integrate mental health in a way</p>
<p>where we would be able to make money and we can&rsquo;t just yet.</p>
<p>So yeah, there have been a lot of models that came out</p>
<p>during COVID that allow for you to text with somebody</p>
<p>and do virtual therapy.</p>
<p>There are a lot of therapists who offer a sliding scale.</p>
<p>But part of the reason it&rsquo;s a little bit more difficult</p>
<p>is that the patient panel size, the number of people</p>
<p>they can take on, is so much lower</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a higher touch experience.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard to integrate it into the traditional primary</p>
<p>care model where across the US, one physician</p>
<p>has a panel of 2,300 patients on average.</p>
<p>And so you just can&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>like that for mental health.</p>
<p>Are there large population health issues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d love to just get on the radar of folks</p>
<p>in this room that are poorly understood?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>Like there is somebody I follow.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a writer, I think, for the,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if it was the New York Times or something.</p>
<p>And she said her best friend died of a heart</p>
<p>attack in her 40s.</p>
<p>And then she had some stats about the incidence</p>
<p>of heart disease amongst women versus men.</p>
<p>And I had always assumed that it was largely</p>
<p>a male predominant issue until I saw those stats</p>
<p>and I realized, my god, this is a broadly pervasive issue.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of lifestyle, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I learned something in that moment I didn&rsquo;t know before.</p>
<p>But any broad population level issues</p>
<p>that you think are really important</p>
<p>for folks here to know about?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, sort of related to that,</p>
<p>I would say nutrition label literacy</p>
<p>is so hugely important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much scary marketing that people</p>
<p>have to educate themselves on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a part-time job to have to learn</p>
<p>about why this product that looks extremely healthy</p>
<p>and is like using the new brand colors</p>
<p>that are not Dorito-y, that looks like it should</p>
<p>be vegan and organic, is actually really bad for you.</p>
<p>So having more education on what makes for good food,</p>
<p>I think, would cut out a huge, huge portion</p>
<p>of our preventive lifestyle.</p>
<p>How can people find out more about the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Landry, L-A-N-D-R-Y?</p>
<p>This is the nightmare of my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Landby, L-A-N-B-Y.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the big screen, Jason.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>How can they find out more about it</p>
<p>if they wanted to become a member?</p>
<p>How do they become a member?</p>
<p>Are there membership available?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just right there, L-A-N-B-Y.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be a website, I&rsquo;m assuming,</p>
<p>or you have an email or something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the website is actually L-A-N-D-Y.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the Landry.</p>
<p>Mostly people call it the Lamby, like a lamb.</p>
<p>So the Landry is.</p>
<p>I keep hearing people mispronounce it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already lived a lifelong Candace life,</p>
<p>and now I have a mispronunciation</p>
<p>with the Lamby all the time.</p>
<p>So you can just go to thelamby.com.</p>
<p>You can apply for membership at the top of the website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in New York.</p>
<p>Can it scale?</p>
<p>And are you gonna raise money for this?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be a venture-based investment?</p>
<p>Because it sounds fascinating to me as a business model.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re actually raising our seed right now.</p>
<p>We predominantly raise money through our members so far,</p>
<p>which has been really nice,</p>
<p>is having our consumers as investors.</p>
<p>But yeah, it can reach a venture scale</p>
<p>because the way we&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>not to get too in the weeds,</p>
<p>is through a three-person care team model.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to take on more patients per panel</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re assigned not just a doctor,</p>
<p>but also a nutritionist and a concierge manager</p>
<p>who does all the patient homework for you.</p>
<p>So raising a seed and, yeah,</p>
<p>let me know where to send the check.</p>
<p>Sounds great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s thank Tandis for taking the time.</p>
<p>Thanks, Tandis.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sackman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And instead, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at the place.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>B?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
