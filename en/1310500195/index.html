    <p>The following is a conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger, a founding member of the</p>
<p>Consilience Project that is aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue.</p>
<p>He is interested in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals</p>
<p>and as collectives at all scales.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and</p>
<p>BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the mic for a</p>
<p>couple of days.</p>
<p>We took a long walk the day before our conversation.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed meeting him, just on a basic human level.</p>
<p>We talked about the world around us with words that carried hope for us individual ants actually</p>
<p>contributing something of value to the colony.</p>
<p>These conversations are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen</p>
<p>the suffering in the world.</p>
<p>But more than that, there&rsquo;s a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time</p>
<p>and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends, and creating something that is far greater</p>
<p>than the sum of our parts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with a few new friends</p>
<p>and in random bars in my travels across this country.</p>
<p>Where a conversation leaves me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation</p>
<p>of this too short, too beautiful life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger.</p>
<p>If aliens were observing Earth through the entire history, just watching us, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tasked with summarizing what happened until now, what do you think they would say?</p>
<p>What do you think they would write up in that summary?</p>
<p>Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page.</p>
<p>Like in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide, there&rsquo;s I think like a paragraph or a couple sentences.</p>
<p>How would you summarize, sorry, how would the aliens summarize, do you think, all of</p>
<p>human civilization?</p>
<p>My first thoughts take more than a page.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably distill it.</p>
<p>Because if they watched, well, I mean, first, I have no idea if their senses are even attuned</p>
<p>to similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to, or what the nature of their consciousness</p>
<p>is like relative to ours.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume that they&rsquo;re kind of like us, just technologically more advanced to</p>
<p>get here from wherever they are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first kind of constraint on the thought experiment.</p>
<p>And then if they&rsquo;ve watched throughout all of history, they saw the burning of Alexandria.</p>
<p>They saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece, we were producing things like clocks, the antikytheria</p>
<p>mechanism, and then that technology got lost.</p>
<p>They saw that there wasn&rsquo;t just a steady dialectic of progress.</p>
<p>So every once in a while, there&rsquo;s a giant fire that destroys a lot of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a giant commotion that destroys a lot of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s usually self induced.</p>
<p>They would have seen that.</p>
<p>And so as they&rsquo;re looking at us now, as we move past the nuclear weapons age into the</p>
<p>full globalization, anthropocene, exponential tech age, still making our decisions relatively</p>
<p>similarly to how we did in the stone age as far as rivalry game theory type stuff, I think</p>
<p>they would think that this is probably most likely one of the planets that is not going</p>
<p>to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves up in the technological</p>
<p>adolescence.</p>
<p>And if we are going to, we&rsquo;re going to need some major progress rapidly in the social</p>
<p>technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies so that we are safe</p>
<p>vessels for the amount of power we&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Actually, Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing</p>
<p>poses to the rest of the galaxy.</p>
<p>And I think, I forget what it was, I think it was medium or low.</p>
<p>So their estimation was, would be that this species of ant like creatures is not going</p>
<p>to survive long.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ups and downs in terms of technological innovation.</p>
<p>The fundamental nature of their behavior from a game theory perspective hasn&rsquo;t really changed.</p>
<p>They have not learned in any fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or</p>
<p>properly do the mechanism design of games to ensure long term survival.</p>
<p>And then they move on to another planet.</p>
<p>Do you think there is, in a slightly more serious question, do you think there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>number or perhaps a very, very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>Yes, would be hard to think otherwise.</p>
<p>I know, I think Bostrom had a new article not that long ago on why that might not be</p>
<p>the case, that the Drake equation might not be the kind of end story on it.</p>
<p>But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we&rsquo;re aware of just galactically</p>
<p>and also like when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake that didn&rsquo;t have the same six</p>
<p>primary atoms, I think it had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one of the primary aspects of</p>
<p>its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks might be more different.</p>
<p>So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more different.</p>
<p>It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we&rsquo;ve observed that are still</p>
<p>unexplained.</p>
<p>As you had guests on your show discussing Tic Tac and all the ones that have visited.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s dive right into that.</p>
<p>What do you make sense of the rich human psychology of there being hundreds of thousands, probably</p>
<p>millions of witnesses of UFOs of different kinds on Earth, most of which I presume are</p>
<p>conjured up by the human mind through the perception system.</p>
<p>Some number might be true, some number might be reflective of actual physical objects,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s you know, drones or testing military technology that secret or otherworldly technology.</p>
<p>What do you make sense of all of that, because it&rsquo;s gained quite a bit of popularity recently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sense in which that&rsquo;s us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly</p>
<p>creatures as a way to escape the dreariness of our of the human condition.</p>
<p>But in another sense, it could be it really could be something truly exciting that science</p>
<p>should turn its eye towards.</p>
<p>So what do you where do you place it?</p>
<p>Speaking of turning eye towards this is one of those super fascinating, actually super</p>
<p>consequential possibly topics that I wish I had more time to study and just haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allocated so I don&rsquo;t have firm beliefs on this because I haven&rsquo;t got to study it as</p>
<p>much as I want.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m going to say comes from a superficial assessment.</p>
<p>While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we</p>
<p>can fully write off, we have other better explanations for them.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re interested in is the ones that we don&rsquo;t have better explanations for and</p>
<p>then not just immediately jumping to a theory of what it is, but holding it as unidentified</p>
<p>and being being curious and earnest.</p>
<p>I think the the tic tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you ever saw the Disclosure Project, a guy named Steven Greer organized</p>
<p>a bunch of mostly US military and some commercial flight people who had direct observation and</p>
<p>classified information disclosing it at a CNN briefing.</p>
<p>And so you saw high ranking generals, admirals, fighter pilots all describing things that</p>
<p>they saw on radar with their own eyes or cameras, and also describing some phenomena that had</p>
<p>some consistency across different people.</p>
<p>And I find this interesting enough that I think it would be silly to just dismiss it.</p>
<p>And specifically, we can ask the question, how much of it is natural phenomena, ball</p>
<p>lightning or something like that?</p>
<p>And this is why I&rsquo;m more interested in what fighter pilots and astronauts and people who</p>
<p>are trained in being able to identify flying objects and atmospheric phenomena have to</p>
<p>say about it.</p>
<p>I think the thing then you could say, well, are they more advanced military craft?</p>
<p>Is it some kind of, you know, human craft?</p>
<p>The interesting thing that a number of them describe is something that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>right angles at speed, or not right angles, acute angles at speed, but something that</p>
<p>looks like a different relationship to inertia than physics makes sense for us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there are any human technologies that are doing that even in really deep underground</p>
<p>black projects.</p>
<p>Now one could say, okay, well, could it be a hologram?</p>
<p>Or would it show up on radar if radar is also seeing it?</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s enough, I mean, and for that to be a massive coordinated psyop, is it as</p>
<p>interesting and ridiculous in a way as the idea that it&rsquo;s UFOs from some extra planetary</p>
<p>source?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up there on the interesting topics.</p>
<p>To me there&rsquo;s, if it is at all alien technology, it is the dumbest version of alien technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so far away, it&rsquo;s like the old, old crappy VHS tapes of alien technology.</p>
<p>These are like crappy drones that just floated or even like space to the level of like space</p>
<p>junk because it is so close to our human technology.</p>
<p>We talk about it moves in ways that&rsquo;s unlike what we understand about physics, but it still</p>
<p>has very similar kind of geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive</p>
<p>with our eyes, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I feel like alien technology most likely would be something that we would not be able to</p>
<p>perceive.</p>
<p>Not because they&rsquo;re hiding, but because it&rsquo;s so far advanced that it would be beyond the</p>
<p>cognitive capabilities of us humans.</p>
<p>Just as you were saying, as per your answer for alien summarizing Earth, the starting</p>
<p>assumption is they have similar perception systems, they have similar cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>and that very well may not be the case.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about staying in aliens for just a little longer because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good transition in talking about governments and human societies.</p>
<p>Do you think if a US government or any government was in possession of an alien spacecraft or</p>
<p>of information related to alien spacecraft, they would have the capacity, structurally</p>
<p>would they have the processes, would they be able to communicate that to the public</p>
<p>effectively or would they keep it secret in a room and do nothing with it, both to try</p>
<p>to preserve military secrets, but also because of the incompetence that&rsquo;s inherent to bureaucracies</p>
<p>or either?</p>
<p>Well, we can certainly see when certain things become declassified 25 or 50 years later that</p>
<p>there were things that the public might have wanted to know that were kept secret for a</p>
<p>very long time for reasons of at least supposedly national security, which is also a nice source</p>
<p>of plausible deniability for people covering their ass for doing things that would be problematic</p>
<p>and other purposes.</p>
<p>There are, there&rsquo;s a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that was</p>
<p>recovered from Area 51 type area, did analysis on it using, I believe, electron microscopy</p>
<p>and a couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was</p>
<p>something we didn&rsquo;t currently have the ability to do, was not naturally occurring.</p>
<p>So there, I&rsquo;ve heard some things and again, like I said, I&rsquo;m not going to stand behind</p>
<p>any of these because I haven&rsquo;t done the level of study to have high confidence.</p>
<p>I think what you said also about would it be super low tech alien craft, like would</p>
<p>they necessarily move their atoms around in space or might they do something more interesting</p>
<p>than that, might they be able to have a different relationship to the concept of space or information</p>
<p>or consciousness or one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not only accelerate</p>
<p>and turn in a way that looks non inertial, but also disappear.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a question as to like the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive and it</p>
<p>could be possible to, some people run a hypothesis that they create intentional amounts of exposure</p>
<p>as an invitation of a particular kind, who knows, interesting field.</p>
<p>We tend to assume like SETI that&rsquo;s listening out for aliens out there, I&rsquo;ve just been</p>
<p>recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have orbiting black holes that</p>
<p>orbit each other, they generate ripples in space time on my, for fun at night when I</p>
<p>lay in bed, I think about what it would be like to ride those waves when they, not the</p>
<p>low magnitude they are when they reach earth, but get closer to the black holes because</p>
<p>it will basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions, including time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually ripples through space time that they generate.</p>
<p>Why is it that you couldn&rsquo;t use that, it travels the speed of light, travels at a speed which</p>
<p>is a very weird thing to say when you&rsquo;re morphing space time, you could argue it&rsquo;s faster than</p>
<p>the speed of light.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re able to communicate by, to summon enough energy to generate black holes and</p>
<p>to orbit them, to force them to orbit each other, why not travel as the ripples in space</p>
<p>time, whatever the hell that means, somehow combined with wormholes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re able to communicate through, like we don&rsquo;t think of gravitational waves</p>
<p>as something you can communicate with because the radio will have to be a very large size</p>
<p>and very dense, but perhaps that&rsquo;s it, perhaps that&rsquo;s one way to communicate, it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>effective way.</p>
<p>And that would explain, like we wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to make sense of that, of the physics</p>
<p>that results in an alien species that&rsquo;s able to control gravity at that scale.</p>
<p>I think you just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far that you&rsquo;re not just harnessing the</p>
<p>power of a star, but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way above my physics pay grade to think about including even non rotating black hole</p>
<p>versions of transwarp travel.</p>
<p>I think, you know, you can talk with Eric more about that, I think he has better ideas</p>
<p>on it than I do.</p>
<p>My hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term on our ability</p>
<p>to get to other habitable planets in time.</p>
<p>And even more than that, in the list of possible solutions of how to improve human civilization,</p>
<p>orbiting black holes is not on the first page for you.</p>
<p>Not on the first page.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I bet you did not expect us to start this conversation here, but I&rsquo;m glad the places</p>
<p>it went.</p>
<p>I am excited on a much smaller scale of Mars, Europa, Titan, Venus, potentially having very</p>
<p>like bacteria like life forms, just on a small human level, it&rsquo;s a little bit scary, but</p>
<p>mostly really exciting that there might be life elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans</p>
<p>all around us, teaming, having little societies and whether there&rsquo;s properties about that</p>
<p>kind of life that&rsquo;s somehow different than ours.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms,</p>
<p>what would be more exciting if they&rsquo;re different or they&rsquo;re the same?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re the same, that means through the rest of the universe, there&rsquo;s life forms like</p>
<p>us, something like us everywhere.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re different, that&rsquo;s also really exciting because there&rsquo;s life forms everywhere that</p>
<p>are not like us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s scarier actually.</p>
<p>I think both scary and exciting no matter what, right?</p>
<p>The idea that they could be very different is philosophically very interesting for us</p>
<p>to open our aperture on what life and consciousness and self replicating possibilities could look</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>The question on are they different or the same, obviously there&rsquo;s lots of life here</p>
<p>that is the same in some ways and different in other ways.</p>
<p>When you take the thing that we call an invasive species is something that&rsquo;s still pretty the</p>
<p>same hydrocarbon based thing, but co evolved with co selective pressures in a certain environment,</p>
<p>we move it to another environment, it might be devastating to that whole ecosystem because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just different enough that it messes up the self stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem.</p>
<p>So the question of are they, would they be different in ways where we could still figure</p>
<p>out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally not fundamentally the nature</p>
<p>of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be incommensurable is a deep</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Well, we offline talked about mimetic theory, right?</p>
<p>It seems like if there were sufficiently different where we would not even, we can coexist on</p>
<p>different planes, it seems like a good thing.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re close enough together to where we&rsquo;d be competing, then it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re getting into</p>
<p>the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things to where we would, one</p>
<p>of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder without even accidentally.</p>
<p>If we just had a self replicating single celled kind of creature that happened to not work</p>
<p>well for the hydrocarbon life that was here that got introduced because he either output</p>
<p>something that was toxic or utilized up the same resource too quickly and it just replicated</p>
<p>faster and mutated faster, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a mimetic theory, conflict theory kind</p>
<p>of harm.</p>
<p>It would just be a Von Neumann machine, a self replicating machine that was fundamentally</p>
<p>incompatible with these kinds of self replicating systems with faster OODA loops.</p>
<p>For one final time, putting your alien God hat on and you look at human civilization,</p>
<p>do you think about the 7.8 billion people on earth as individual little creatures, individual</p>
<p>little organisms, or do you think of us as one organism with a collective intelligence?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the proper framework through which to analyze it again as an alien?</p>
<p>So that I know where you&rsquo;re coming from, would you have asked the question the same way before</p>
<p>the industrial revolution, before the agricultural revolution when there were half a billion</p>
<p>people and no telecommunications connecting them?</p>
<p>I would indeed ask the question the same way, but I would be less confident about your conclusions.</p>
<p>It would be an actually more interesting way to ask the question at that time, but I was</p>
<p>nevertheless asked it the same way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go back further and smaller than rather than just a single human or the entire</p>
<p>human species, let&rsquo;s look at a relatively isolated tribe.</p>
<p>In the relatively isolated, probably sub Dunbar number, sub 150 people tribe, do I look at</p>
<p>that as one entity where evolution is selecting for based on group selection or do I think</p>
<p>of it as 150 individuals that are interacting in some way?</p>
<p>Well, could those individuals exist without the group?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and individual</p>
<p>humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren&rsquo;t what was</p>
<p>selected for.</p>
<p>And so I think the or is the wrong frame.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s individuals are affecting the group that they&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also dependent upon and being affected by the group that they&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>And so this now starts to get deep into political theories also, which is theories that orient</p>
<p>towards the collective at different scales, whether a tribal scale or an empire or a nation</p>
<p>state or something, and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s very obvious failure modes on both sides.</p>
<p>And so the relationship between them is more interesting to me than either of them.</p>
<p>The relationship between the individual and the collective and the question around how</p>
<p>to have a virtuous process between those.</p>
<p>So a good social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism</p>
<p>of the group of individuals is they&rsquo;re both synergistic to each other.</p>
<p>So what is best for the individuals and what&rsquo;s best for the whole is aligned.</p>
<p>But there is nevertheless an individual.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s a matter of degrees, I suppose, but what defines a human more, the social</p>
<p>network within which they&rsquo;ve been brought up, through which they&rsquo;ve developed their</p>
<p>intelligence or is it their own sovereign individual self?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition of how much, not just for evolutionary survival, but as intellectual</p>
<p>beings, how much do we need others for our development?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of sapient</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>I think the vast majority of sapient history is tribal, like depending upon your early</p>
<p>human model, 200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapiens and little tribes, where they depended</p>
<p>upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was fatal.</p>
<p>I think they, and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount</p>
<p>of time we&rsquo;ve been out of it is relatively so tiny.</p>
<p>And then we still depended upon extended families and local communities more and the big kind</p>
<p>of giant market complex where I can provide something to the market to get money, to be</p>
<p>able to get other things from the market where it seems like I don&rsquo;t need anyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like disintermediating our sense of need, even though you&rsquo;re in my ability</p>
<p>to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we coordinated on took millions</p>
<p>of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains that made all the stuff</p>
<p>that we depend on, but we don&rsquo;t notice that we depend upon them.</p>
<p>They all seem fungible.</p>
<p>If you take a baby, obviously that you didn&rsquo;t even get to a baby without a mom.</p>
<p>Was it dependent?</p>
<p>Are we dependent upon each other, right, without two parents at minimum and they depended upon</p>
<p>other people.</p>
<p>But if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild, it obviously dies.</p>
<p>So if we let it grow up for a little while, the minimum amount of time where it starts</p>
<p>to have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild, and this has happened a few times,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t learn language and it doesn&rsquo;t learn the small motor articulation that we learn.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is socialized.</p>
<p>So I think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us.</p>
<p>Is it possible that it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing?</p>
<p>The whole thing is the connection between us humans and that we&rsquo;re no better than apes</p>
<p>without our human connections.</p>
<p>Because thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently about human society</p>
<p>and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental.</p>
<p>I just have to object to the no better than apes, because better here I think you mean</p>
<p>a specific thing, which means have capacities that are fundamentally different than.</p>
<p>I think apes also depend upon troops.</p>
<p>And I think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of ethical sense ends</p>
<p>up having heaps of problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll table that.</p>
<p>We can come back to it.</p>
<p>But when we say what is unique about Homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals</p>
<p>we currently inhabit the biosphere with, and I&rsquo;m saying it that way because there were</p>
<p>other early hominids that had some of these capacities, we believe.</p>
<p>Our tool creation and our language creation and our coordination are all kind of the results</p>
<p>of a certain type of capacity for abstraction.</p>
<p>And other animals will use tools, but they don&rsquo;t evolve the tools they use.</p>
<p>They keep using the same types of tools that they basically can find.</p>
<p>So a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine that it wants to, and it&rsquo;ll even notice</p>
<p>that a sharper rock will cut it better.</p>
<p>And experientially it&rsquo;ll use the sharper rock.</p>
<p>And if you even give it a knife, it&rsquo;ll probably use the knife because it&rsquo;s experiencing the</p>
<p>effectiveness.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t make stone tools because that requires understanding why one is sharper</p>
<p>than the other.</p>
<p>What is the abstract principle called sharpness to then be able to invent a sharper thing?</p>
<p>That same abstraction makes language and the ability for abstract representation, which</p>
<p>makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways.</p>
<p>So I do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection</p>
<p>of what we are as a species.</p>
<p>I wonder if that coordination, that connection is actually the thing that gives birth to</p>
<p>consciousness, that gives birth to, well, let&rsquo;s start with self awareness.</p>
<p>More like theory of mind.</p>
<p>Theory of mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I suppose there&rsquo;s experiments that show that there&rsquo;s other mammals that have</p>
<p>a very crude theory of mind.</p>
<p>Not sure.</p>
<p>Maybe dogs, something like that.</p>
<p>But actually dogs probably has to do with that they co evolved with humans.</p>
<p>See it&rsquo;d be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the</p>
<p>way we think about it.</p>
<p>Is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness.</p>
<p>I have an inkling sense that that only exists because we&rsquo;re social creatures.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t come with the hardware and the software in the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s learned as an effective tool for communication almost.</p>
<p>I think we think that consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the illusion</p>
<p>of consciousness is consciousness.</p>
<p>That it is just a facade we use to help us construct theories of mind.</p>
<p>You almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being.</p>
<p>And that experience, you want to richly experience it as an individual person so that I could</p>
<p>empathize with your experience.</p>
<p>I find that notion compelling.</p>
<p>Mostly because it allows you to then create robots that become conscious not by being</p>
<p>quote unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till they make it.</p>
<p>Present a facade of consciousness with the task of making that facade very convincing</p>
<p>to us humans and thereby it will become conscious.</p>
<p>Have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they&rsquo;re sufficiently convincing</p>
<p>to humans.</p>
<p>Is there some element of that that you find convincing?</p>
<p>This is a much harder set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the</p>
<p>aliens was.</p>
<p>We went from aliens to consciousness.</p>
<p>This is not the trajectory I was expecting nor you, but let us walk a while.</p>
<p>We can walk a while and I don&rsquo;t think we will do it justice.</p>
<p>So what do we mean by consciousness versus conscious self reflective awareness?</p>
<p>What do we mean by awareness, qualia, theory of mind?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and subjectivity,</p>
<p>first person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly the quote, but I remember when reading when Sam Harris wrote</p>
<p>the book Free Will and then Dennett critiqued it and then there was some writing back and</p>
<p>forth between the two because normally they&rsquo;re on the same side of kind of arguing for critical</p>
<p>thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against supernatural ideas.</p>
<p>And here Dennett believed there is something like free will.</p>
<p>He is a determinist compatibilist, but no consciousness and a radical element of this.</p>
<p>And Sam was saying, no, there is consciousness, but there&rsquo;s no free will.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they disagreed on, but</p>
<p>neither of them could say it was because the other one didn&rsquo;t understand the philosophy</p>
<p>of science or logical fallacies.</p>
<p>And they kind of spoke past each other and at the end, if I remember correctly, Sam said</p>
<p>something that I thought was quite insightful, which was to the effect of it seems, because</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t making any progress in shared understanding, it seems that we simply have</p>
<p>different intuitions about this.</p>
<p>And what you could see was that what the words meant, right at the level of symbol grounding,</p>
<p>might be quite different.</p>
<p>One of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being</p>
<p>referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean.</p>
<p>This is why when trying to address these things, Charles Sanders Peirce said the first philosophy</p>
<p>has to be semiotics, because if you don&rsquo;t get semiotics right, we end up importing different</p>
<p>ideas and bad ideas right into the nature of the language that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s very hard to do epistemology or ontology together.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m saying this to say why I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to get very far is I think we</p>
<p>would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental concepts.</p>
<p>Well, and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so that our definitions</p>
<p>of these terms align.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s a beauty that some people enjoy with Sam that he is quite</p>
<p>stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing that definition.</p>
<p>So in his mind, he can sense that he can deeply understand what he means exactly by a term</p>
<p>like free will and consciousness.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, he&rsquo;s very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free</p>
<p>will is an illusion, he thinks he&rsquo;s able, not thinks, he says he&rsquo;s able to just remove</p>
<p>himself from the experience of free will and just be like for minutes at a time, hours</p>
<p>at a time, like really experience as if he has no free will, like he&rsquo;s a leaf flowing</p>
<p>down the river.</p>
<p>And given that, he&rsquo;s very sure that consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s this conscious leaf that&rsquo;s subjectively experiencing the floating and yet has no ability</p>
<p>to control and make any decisions for itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a, the decisions have all been made.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps is the problem.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the Vedantic</p>
<p>tradition and some of the Buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described similar experiences</p>
<p>and somewhat similar conclusions, some slightly different.</p>
<p>There are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure</p>
<p>agency and, you know, like the Catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist Teilhard de Chardin</p>
<p>describes this and that rather than a creator agent God in the beginning, there&rsquo;s a creative</p>
<p>impulse or a creative process and he would go into a type of meditation that identified</p>
<p>as the pure essence of that kind of creative process.</p>
<p>And I think the types of experience we&rsquo;ve had and then one, the types of experience</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding.</p>
<p>The other thing is the types of experiences we have can&rsquo;t not be interpreted through</p>
<p>our existing interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown</p>
<p>even to us, some of them.</p>
<p>And so this is a tricky, this is a tricky topic.</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s a bunch of directions we could go with it but I want to come back to</p>
<p>what the impulse was that was interesting around what is consciousness and how does</p>
<p>it relate to us as social beings and how does it relate to the possibility of consciousness</p>
<p>with AIs.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re keeping us on track which is, which is wonderful, you&rsquo;re a wonderful hiking</p>
<p>partner.</p>
<p>Okay, yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse</p>
<p>connect to consciousness?</p>
<p>Is consciousness a consequence of that social connection?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to state a position and not argue it because it&rsquo;s honestly like it&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another time if you want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural networks.</p>
<p>Obviously a lot of people do, obviously the philosophy of science orients towards that</p>
<p>in not absolutely but largely.</p>
<p>I think of the nature of first person, the universe of first person, of qualia as experience,</p>
<p>sensation, desire, emotion, phenomenology, but the felt sense, not the we say emotion</p>
<p>and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern.</p>
<p>But all of the physical stuff, the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge</p>
<p>and stuff like that that is measurable, repeatable.</p>
<p>I think of the nature of first person and third person as ontologically orthogonal to</p>
<p>each other, not reducible to each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So I think about the evolution of third person that we&rsquo;re quite used to thinking about from</p>
<p>subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on.</p>
<p>I think about a similar kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from</p>
<p>the way Whitehead talked about kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self</p>
<p>organization into higher orders of it and that there&rsquo;s correspondence, but that neither</p>
<p>like the idealists do we reduce third person to first person, which is what idealists do,</p>
<p>or neither like the physicalists do we reduce first person to third person.</p>
<p>Obviously Bohm talked about an implicate order that was deeper than and gave rise to the</p>
<p>explicate order of both.</p>
<p>Nagel talks about something like that.</p>
<p>I have a slightly different sense of that, but again, I&rsquo;ll just kind of not argue how</p>
<p>that occurs for a moment and say, so rather than say, does consciousness emerge from,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about do higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not first person as a category emerging from third person, but increased complexity</p>
<p>within the nature of first person and third person co evolving.</p>
<p>Do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural networks have deeper</p>
<p>phenomenology, more complex, where it goes just from basic sensation to emotion to social</p>
<p>awareness to abstract cognition to self reflexive abstract cognition?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s the emergence of consciousness.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s increased complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to</p>
<p>increased complexity and the correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal.</p>
<p>We can get into the arguments for why that often is the case.</p>
<p>So would I say that obviously the sapient brain is pretty unique and a single sapient</p>
<p>now has that, right?</p>
<p>Even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group selection to make that brain.</p>
<p>So the group made it now that brain is there.</p>
<p>Now if I take that single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them</p>
<p>in a box, they&rsquo;ll still not be very interesting even with the brain.</p>
<p>But the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned in relationship can have</p>
<p>interesting things emerge.</p>
<p>So do I think that the human biology, types of human consciousness and types of social</p>
<p>interaction all co emerged and co evolved?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As a small aside, as you&rsquo;re talking about the biology, let me comment that I spent,</p>
<p>this is what I do, this is what I do with my life.</p>
<p>This is why I will never accomplish anything is I spent much of the morning trying to do</p>
<p>research on how many computations the brain performs and how much energy it uses versus</p>
<p>the state of the art CPUs and GPUs arriving at about 20 quadrillion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s two to the 10 to the 16 computations.</p>
<p>So synaptic firings per second that the brain does.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about a million times faster than the let&rsquo;s say the 20 thread state of the</p>
<p>arts Intel CPU, the 10th generation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s similar calculation for the GPU and all ended up also trying to compute</p>
<p>that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about.</p>
<p>And then what does that mean in terms of calories per day, kilocalories?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about for an average human brain, that&rsquo;s 250 to 300 calories a day.</p>
<p>And so it ended up being a calculation where you&rsquo;re doing about 20 quadrillion calculations</p>
<p>that are fueled by something like depending on your diet, three bananas.</p>
<p>So three bananas results in a computation that&rsquo;s about a million times more powerful</p>
<p>than the current state of the art computers.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take that one step further.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some assumptions built in there.</p>
<p>The assumption is that one, what the brain is doing is just computation.</p>
<p>Two, the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there&rsquo;s nothing other than</p>
<p>synaptic firings that we have to factor.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m forgetting his name right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very famous neuroscientist at Stanford just passed away recently who did a lot of</p>
<p>the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge</p>
<p>amount of the thinking, not just neurons.</p>
<p>And it opened up this entirely different field of like what the brain is and what consciousness</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>You look at Damasio&rsquo;s work on embodied cognition and how much of what we would consider consciousness</p>
<p>or feeling is happening outside of the nervous system completely, happening in endocrine</p>
<p>process involving lots of other cells and signal communication.</p>
<p>You talk to somebody like Penrose who you&rsquo;ve had on the show and even though the Penrose</p>
<p>Hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right, is there something like that that might be</p>
<p>the case where we&rsquo;re actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum</p>
<p>computation of microtubules?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing for any of those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m arguing that we don&rsquo;t know how big the unknown unknown set is.</p>
<p>Well, at the very least, this has become like an infomercial for the human brain.</p>
<p>At the very, but wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>At the very least, the three bananas buys you a million times.</p>
<p>At the very least.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>And then you could have, and then the synaptic firings we&rsquo;re referring to is strictly the</p>
<p>electrical signals.</p>
<p>That could be the mechanical transmission of information, there&rsquo;s chemical transmission</p>
<p>of information, there&rsquo;s all kinds of other stuff going on.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s memory that&rsquo;s built in, that&rsquo;s also all tied in.</p>
<p>Not to mention, which I&rsquo;m learning more and more about, it&rsquo;s not just about the neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about the immune system that&rsquo;s somehow helping with the computation.</p>
<p>So the entirety and the entire body is helping with the computation.</p>
<p>So the three bananas.</p>
<p>It could buy you a lot.</p>
<p>But on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness, I</p>
<p>think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain,</p>
<p>just looking at systems where simple rules create incredible complexity.</p>
<p>Not create.</p>
<p>Incredible complexity emerges.</p>
<p>So one of the simplest things to do that with is cellular automata.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, and maybe you can speak to it, we will certainly</p>
<p>talk about the implications of this, but there&rsquo;s so few things that are as awe inspiring to</p>
<p>me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>And it creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on, looks like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actual organisms doing things that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying</p>
<p>mechanism.</p>
<p>So with cellular automata, that&rsquo;s cells that are born and die.</p>
<p>Born and die and they only know about each other&rsquo;s neighbors.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death.</p>
<p>And then they create, at scale, organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands</p>
<p>of cells and they&rsquo;re moving, they&rsquo;re moving around, they&rsquo;re communicating, they&rsquo;re sending</p>
<p>signals to each other.</p>
<p>And you forget at moments at a time before you remember that the simple rules on cells</p>
<p>is all that it took to create that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad in that we can&rsquo;t come up with a simple description of that system that generalizes</p>
<p>the behavior of the large organisms.</p>
<p>We can only come up, we can only hope to come up with the thing, the fundamental physics</p>
<p>or the fundamental rules of that system, I suppose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that we can&rsquo;t predict everything we know about the mathematics of those systems.</p>
<p>It seems like we can&rsquo;t really in a nice way, like economics tries to do, to predict how</p>
<p>this whole thing will unroll.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s beautiful because of how simple it is underneath it all.</p>
<p>So what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules?</p>
<p>What the hell is that about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we can see that something like flocking behavior, the murmuration, can be computer</p>
<p>coded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of</p>
<p>complexity.</p>
<p>And the whole field of complexity science and some of the subdisciplines like Stigma</p>
<p>G are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant colonies</p>
<p>do this amazing thing where what you might describe as the organizational or computational</p>
<p>capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual ant is doing.</p>
<p>I am not anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular automata as I would</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in terms of topics that I would like to get to and haven&rsquo;t, like ET&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>Wolfram&rsquo;s A New Kind of Science, I have only skimmed and read reviews of and not read the</p>
<p>whole thing or his newer work since.</p>
<p>But his idea of the four basic kind of categories of emergent phenomena that can come from cellular</p>
<p>automata and that one of them is kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than</p>
<p>just chaos or homogeneity or self termination or whatever.</p>
<p>I think this is very interesting.</p>
<p>It does not instantly make me think that biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules</p>
<p>and or that human consciousness is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that reductionist oriented.</p>
<p>So if you look at, say, Santa Fe Institute, one of the cofounders, Stuart Kaufman, his</p>
<p>work, you should really get him on your show.</p>
<p>So a lot of the questions that you like, one of Kaufman&rsquo;s more recent books after investigations</p>
<p>and some of the real fundamental stuff was called Reinventing the Sacred and it had to</p>
<p>do with some of these exact questions in kind of non reductionist approach, but that is</p>
<p>not just silly hippie ism.</p>
<p>And he was very interested in highly non ergodic systems where you couldn&rsquo;t take a lot of behavior</p>
<p>over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of subsets over a longer period</p>
<p>of time would do.</p>
<p>And then going further, someone who spent some time at Santa Fe Institute and then kind</p>
<p>of made a whole new field that you should have on, Dave Snowden, who some people call</p>
<p>the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity unique to humans.</p>
<p>And he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cut it.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using Stigma</p>
<p>G like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors, but it really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work for trying to make sense of the Sistine Chapel and Picasso and general relativity</p>
<p>creation and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the termites are not doing abstraction, forecasting deep into the future</p>
<p>and making choices now based on forecasts of the future, not just adaptive signals in</p>
<p>the moment and evolutionary code from history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really different, right?</p>
<p>Like making choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future.</p>
<p>And with humans, our uniqueness one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli</p>
<p>is much higher than it is with a termite.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically fungible within a class, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different classes, but within a class they&rsquo;re basically fungible and their system</p>
<p>uses that very high numbers and lots of loss, right?</p>
<p>Lots of death and loss.</p>
<p>But do you think the termite feels that way?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness?</p>
<p>Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t, it just, isn&rsquo;t there some sense in which this emergence just creates</p>
<p>different higher and higher levels of abstraction where every, at every layer, each organism</p>
<p>feels unique?</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re all equally dumb but at different scales?</p>
<p>No, I think uniqueness is evolving.</p>
<p>I think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>And I think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are.</p>
<p>And I think that highly K selected species are more unique than R selected species.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re different evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>The R selected species where you have a whole, a lot of death and very high birth rates,</p>
<p>and not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to</p>
<p>cover the evolutionary search space within an individual.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at it more in terms of a numbers game.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would say there&rsquo;s probably more difference between one orca and the next than</p>
<p>there is between one Cape buffalo and the next.</p>
<p>Given that, it would be interesting to get your thoughts about memetic theory where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>imitating each other in the context of this idea of uniqueness.</p>
<p>How much truth is there to that?</p>
<p>How compelling is this worldview to you of Girardian memetic theory of desire where maybe</p>
<p>you can explain it from your perspective, but it seems like imitating each other is</p>
<p>the fundamental property of the behavior of human civilization.</p>
<p>Well, imitation is not unique to humans, right?</p>
<p>Monkeys imitate.</p>
<p>So a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans.</p>
<p>Humans do more of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment.</p>
<p>Monkeys can learn new behaviors, new&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a kind of mimesis, right?</p>
<p>Kind of learning through imitation.</p>
<p>And that needs to happen if they need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded</p>
<p>by their genetics, right?</p>
<p>So within the same genome, they&rsquo;re learning new things based on the environment.</p>
<p>And so based on someone else learn something first and so let&rsquo;s pick it up.</p>
<p>How much a creature is the result of just its genetic programming and how much it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>learning is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>And I think this is a place where humans really show up radically different than everything</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And you can see it in the neoteny, how long we&rsquo;re basically fetal.</p>
<p>That the closest ancestors to us, if we look at a chimp, a chimp can hold on to its mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fur while she moves around day one.</p>
<p>And obviously we see horses up and walking within 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it takes a horse 20 minutes and</p>
<p>you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year, like that&rsquo;s a long period of</p>
<p>helplessness that wouldn&rsquo;t work for a horse, right?</p>
<p>Like they or anything else.</p>
<p>And not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day, it&rsquo;s three months before we</p>
<p>can move our head volitionally.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like why are we embryonic for so long?</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s still fetal on the outside, had to be because couldn&rsquo;t keep growing</p>
<p>inside and actually ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a place where there&rsquo;s a coevolution of the pattern of humans, specifically here</p>
<p>our neoteny and what that portends to learning with our being tool making and environment</p>
<p>modifying creatures, which is because we have the abstraction to make tools, we change our</p>
<p>environments more than other creatures change their environments.</p>
<p>The next most environment modifying creature to us is like a beaver.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re in LA, you fly into LAX and you look at the just orthogonal grid going</p>
<p>on forever in all directions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the earth is changing</p>
<p>more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you&rsquo;re like, okay, wow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying.</p>
<p>So as soon as we started tool making, we were able to change our environments much more</p>
<p>radically.</p>
<p>We could put on clothes and go to a cold place.</p>
<p>And this is really important because we actually went and became apex predators in every environment.</p>
<p>We functioned like apex predators, polar bear can&rsquo;t leave the Arctic and the lion can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave the Savannah and an orca can&rsquo;t leave the ocean.</p>
<p>And we went and became apex predators in all those environments because of our tool creation</p>
<p>capacity.</p>
<p>We could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or at least with</p>
<p>our tools adapted to the environment.</p>
<p>So in every aspect towards any organism in any environment, we&rsquo;re incredibly good at</p>
<p>becoming apex predators.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And nothing else can do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>There is no other apex predator that, you see the other apex predator is only getting</p>
<p>better at being a predator through evolutionary process that&rsquo;s super slow and that super slow</p>
<p>process creates co selective process with their environment.</p>
<p>So as the predator becomes a tiny bit faster, it eats more of the slow prey, the genes of</p>
<p>the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes faster.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making, we increased</p>
<p>our predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it.</p>
<p>As a result, we start outstripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools</p>
<p>and going and becoming apex predator everywhere.</p>
<p>This is why we can&rsquo;t keep applying apex predator theories because we&rsquo;re not an apex predator.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an apex predator, but we&rsquo;re something much more than that.</p>
<p>Like just for an example, the top apex predator in the world, an orca.</p>
<p>An orca can eat one big fish at a time, like one tuna, and it&rsquo;ll miss most of the time</p>
<p>or one seal.</p>
<p>And we can put a mile long drift net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We can deplete the entire oceans of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an orca.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an apex predator.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures.</p>
<p>We can extinct species.</p>
<p>We can devastate whole ecosystems.</p>
<p>We can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just human built worlds.</p>
<p>We can build new types of natural creatures, synthetic life.</p>
<p>So we are much more like little gods than we are like apex predators now, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still behaving as apex predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes</p>
<p>a problem kind of core to my assessment of the world.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be a predator?</p>
<p>So a predator is somebody that effectively can mine the resources from a place.</p>
<p>So for their survival, or is it also just purely like higher level objectives of violence</p>
<p>and what is, can predators be predators towards the same, each other towards the same species?</p>
<p>Like are we using the word predator sort of generally, which then connects to conflict</p>
<p>and military conflict, violent conflict in this base of human species.</p>
<p>Obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of their environment in a particular</p>
<p>way, using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals out of the soil and nitrogen and</p>
<p>carbon out of the air and like that.</p>
<p>And we can say herbivores are being able to mine and concentrate that.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t say mining the environment is unique to predator.</p>
<p>Predator is generally being defined as mining other animals, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t consider herbivores predators, but animal, which requires some type of violence</p>
<p>capacity because animals move, plants don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>So it requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go back to the Gerard thing and then we&rsquo;ll come back here.</p>
<p>Why are we neotenous?</p>
<p>Why are we embryonic for so long?</p>
<p>Because are we, did we just move from the Savannah to the Arctic and we need to learn</p>
<p>new stuff?</p>
<p>If we came genetically programmed, we would not be able to do that.</p>
<p>Are we throwing spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain</p>
<p>or are we texting?</p>
<p>What is the adaptive behavior?</p>
<p>Horses today in the wild and horses 10,000 years ago are doing pretty much the same stuff.</p>
<p>And so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our environment so quickly</p>
<p>and other animals are largely the result of their environment, but we&rsquo;re environment modifying</p>
<p>so rapidly, we need to come without too much programming so we can learn the environment</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in, learn the language, right?</p>
<p>Which is going to be very important to learn the tool making.</p>
<p>And so we have a very long period of relative helplessness because we aren&rsquo;t coded how to</p>
<p>behave yet because we&rsquo;re imprinting a lot of software on how to behave that is useful</p>
<p>to that particular time.</p>
<p>So our mimesis is not unique to humans, but the total amount of it is really unique.</p>
<p>And this is also where the uniqueness can go up, right?</p>
<p>Is because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning</p>
<p>through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of, it&rsquo;s almost like our</p>
<p>hardware selected for software, right?</p>
<p>Like if evolution is kind of doing these, think of as a hardware selection, I have problems</p>
<p>with computer metaphors for biology, but I&rsquo;ll use this one here, that we have not had hardware</p>
<p>changes since the beginning of sapiens, but our world is really, really different.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all changes in software, right?</p>
<p>Changes on the same fundamental genetic substrate, what we&rsquo;re doing with these brains and minds</p>
<p>and bodies and social groups and like that.</p>
<p>And so, now, Gerard specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking, so</p>
<p>we learn language, you and I would have a hard time learning Mandarin today or it would</p>
<p>take a lot of work, we&rsquo;d be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff, but a baby learns</p>
<p>it instantly without anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they&rsquo;re doing that and all their</p>
<p>attention is allocated to that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also learning how to move their bodies and they&rsquo;re learning all kinds of stuff</p>
<p>through mimesis.</p>
<p>One of the things that Gerard says is they&rsquo;re also learning what to want.</p>
<p>And they learn what to want.</p>
<p>They learn desire by watching what other people want.</p>
<p>And so, intrinsic to this, people end up wanting what other people want and if we can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>what other people have without taking it away from them, then that becomes a source of conflict.</p>
<p>So the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict and that then the conflict</p>
<p>energy within a group of people will build over time.</p>
<p>This is a very, very crude interpretation of the theory.</p>
<p>Can we just pause on that?</p>
<p>For people who are not familiar and for me who hasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m loosely familiar but haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>internalized it, but every time I think about it, it&rsquo;s a very compelling view of the world.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s true or not, it&rsquo;s quite, it&rsquo;s like when you take everything Freud says as</p>
<p>truth, it&rsquo;s a very interesting way to think about the world and in the same way, thinking</p>
<p>about the mimetic theory of desire that everything we want is imitation of other people&rsquo;s wants.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any original wants.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly imitating others.</p>
<p>And so, and not just others, but others we&rsquo;re exposed to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these little local pockets, however defined local, of people imitating each other.</p>
<p>And one that&rsquo;s super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join.</p>
<p>What do you want to imitate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old like, whoever your friends are, that&rsquo;s what your life is going to be like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s depressing that we&rsquo;re so unoriginal, but it&rsquo;s also liberating in that if this holds</p>
<p>true, that we can choose our life by choosing the people we hang out with.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>Thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they&rsquo;re more absolute than they actually</p>
<p>are end up also being dangerous.</p>
<p>We want to, I&rsquo;m going to discuss here where I think we need to amend this particular theory.</p>
<p>But specifically, you just said something that everyone who&rsquo;s paid attention knows is</p>
<p>true experientially, which is who you&rsquo;re around affects who you become.</p>
<p>And as libertarian and self determining and sovereign as we&rsquo;d like to be, everybody I</p>
<p>think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison, aspects of your personality</p>
<p>would have to adapt or you wouldn&rsquo;t survive there, right?</p>
<p>You would become different.</p>
<p>If you grew up in Darfur versus Finland, you would be different with your same genetics,</p>
<p>like just there&rsquo;s no real question about that.</p>
<p>And that even today, if you hang out in a place with ultra marathoners as your roommates</p>
<p>or all people who are obese as your roommates, the statistical likelihood of what happens</p>
<p>to your fitness is pretty clear, right?</p>
<p>Like the behavioral science of this is pretty clear.</p>
<p>So the whole saying we are the average of the five people we spend the most time around.</p>
<p>I think the more self reflective someone is and the more time they spend by themselves</p>
<p>in self reflection, the less this is true, but it&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p>So one of the best things someone can do to become more self determined is be self determined</p>
<p>about the environments they want to put themselves in, because to the degree that there is some</p>
<p>self determination and some determination by the environment, don&rsquo;t be fighting an environment</p>
<p>that is predisposing you in bad directions.</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things that you want.</p>
<p>In turn, try to affect the environment in ways that predispose positive things for those</p>
<p>around you.</p>
<p>Or perhaps also there&rsquo;s probably interesting ways to play with this.</p>
<p>You could probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension</p>
<p>in all directions to where you&rsquo;re actually free to decide whatever the heck you want,</p>
<p>because the set of wants within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>free to choose whichever one.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s enough tension, as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced.</p>
<p>So if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self empowerment and someone who&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>oriented to kind of empathy and compassion, both the dialectic of those is better than</p>
<p>either of them on their own.</p>
<p>If you have both of them inhabiting, being inhabited better than you by the same person</p>
<p>and spending time around that person will probably do well for you.</p>
<p>I think the thing you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools,</p>
<p>which is I think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and</p>
<p>their not just cognitive learning, but their meaningful problem solving communication and</p>
<p>civic capacity, capacity to participate as a citizen with other people and making the</p>
<p>world better is to be seeking dialectical synthesis all the time.</p>
<p>And so in the Hegelian sense, if you have a thesis, you have an antithesis.</p>
<p>So maybe we have libertarianism on one side and Marxist kind of communism on the other</p>
<p>side.</p>
<p>And one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice.</p>
<p>And so we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they</p>
<p>make more agentic choices, it&rsquo;ll produce a better whole for everybody.</p>
<p>The other side saying, well, the individuals are conditioned by their environment who would</p>
<p>choose to be born into Darfur rather than Finland.</p>
<p>So we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because the environment conditions</p>
<p>the individuals.</p>
<p>So you have a thesis and an antithesis.</p>
<p>And then Hegel&rsquo;s ideas, you have a synthesis, which is a kind of higher order truth that</p>
<p>understands how those relate in a way that neither of them do.</p>
<p>And so it is actually at a higher order of complexity.</p>
<p>So the first part would be, can I steel man each of these?</p>
<p>Can I argue each one well enough that the proponents of it are like, totally, you got</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>And not just argue it rhetorically, but can I inhabit it where I can try to see and feel</p>
<p>the world the way someone seeing and feeling the world that way would?</p>
<p>Because once I do, then I don&rsquo;t want to screw those people because there&rsquo;s truth in it,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to go back to war with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go to finding solutions that could actually work at a higher order.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t go to a higher order, then there&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>And but then the higher order thing would be, well, it seems like the individual does</p>
<p>affect the commons and the collective and other people.</p>
<p>It also seems like the collective conditions individuals at least statistically.</p>
<p>And I can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto and pulled himself up</p>
<p>by his bootstraps.</p>
<p>But I can also say statistically that most people born into the ghetto show up differently</p>
<p>than most people born into the Hamptons.</p>
<p>And so unless you want to argue that and have you take your child from the Hamptons and</p>
<p>put them in the ghetto, then like, come on, be realistic about this thing.</p>
<p>So how do we make, we don&rsquo;t want social systems that make weak dependent individuals, right?</p>
<p>The welfare argument.</p>
<p>But we also don&rsquo;t want no social system that supports individuals to do better.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want individuals where their self expression and agency fucks the environment</p>
<p>and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever.</p>
<p>So can we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning</p>
<p>other individuals?</p>
<p>Can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That would be the synthesis.</p>
<p>So the thing that I&rsquo;m coming to here is if people have that as a frame, and sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just thesis and antithesis, it&rsquo;s like eight different views, right?</p>
<p>Can I steel man each view?</p>
<p>This is not just, can I take the perspective, but am I seeking them?</p>
<p>Am I actively trying to inhabit other people&rsquo;s perspective?</p>
<p>Then can I really try to essentialize it and argue the best points of it, both the sense</p>
<p>making about reality and the values, why these values actually matter?</p>
<p>Then just like I want to seek those perspectives, then I want to seek, is there a higher order</p>
<p>set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize the sense making</p>
<p>of all of them simultaneously?</p>
<p>Maybe I won&rsquo;t get it, but I want to be seeking it and I want to be seeking progressively</p>
<p>better ones.</p>
<p>So this is perspective seeking, driving perspective taking, and then seeking synthesis.</p>
<p>I think that that one cognitive disposition might be the most helpful thing.</p>
<p>Would you put a title of dialectic synthesis on that process because that seems to be such</p>
<p>a part, so like this rigorous empathy, like it&rsquo;s not just empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s empathy with rigor, like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews</p>
<p>and then try to find a higher order synthesis.</p>
<p>Okay, so I remember last night you told me when we first met, you said that you looked</p>
<p>in somebody&rsquo;s eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some ways that they had suffered</p>
<p>and so you could trust them.</p>
<p>Empathy pathos, right, creates a certain sense of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy.</p>
<p>So empathy is actually feeling the suffering of somebody else and feeling the depth of</p>
<p>their sentience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fuck them anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hurt them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to behave, I don&rsquo;t want my proposition to go through when I go and inhabit the perspective</p>
<p>of the other people if they feel that&rsquo;s really going to mess them up, right?</p>
<p>And so the rigorous empathy, it&rsquo;s different than just compassion, which is I generally</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>I have a generalized care, but I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be them.</p>
<p>I can never know what it&rsquo;s like to be them perfectly and that there&rsquo;s a humility you</p>
<p>have to have, which is my most rigorous attempt is still not it.</p>
<p>My most rigorous attempt, mine, to know what it&rsquo;s like to be a woman is still not it.</p>
<p>I have no question that if I was actually a woman, it would be different than my best</p>
<p>guesses.</p>
<p>I have no question if I was actually black, it would be different than my best guesses.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a humility in that which keeps me listening because I don&rsquo;t think that I</p>
<p>know fully, but I want to, and I&rsquo;m going to keep trying better to.</p>
<p>And then I want to accross them, and then I want to say, is there a way we can forward</p>
<p>together and not have to be in war?</p>
<p>It has to be something that could meet the values that everyone holds, that could reconcile</p>
<p>the partial sensemaking that everyone holds, and that could offer a way forward that is</p>
<p>more agreeable than the partial perspectives at war with each other.</p>
<p>But so the more you succeed at this empathy with humility, the more you&rsquo;re carrying the</p>
<p>burden of other people&rsquo;s pain, essentially.</p>
<p>Now, this goes back to the question of do I see us as one being or 7.8 billion.</p>
<p>I think if I&rsquo;m overwhelmed with my own pain, I can&rsquo;t empathize that much because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the bandwidth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the capacity.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t feel like I can do something about a particular problem in the world, it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to feel it because it&rsquo;s just too devastating.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people go numb and even go nihilistic because they just don&rsquo;t feel the</p>
<p>agency.</p>
<p>So as I actually become more empowered as an individual and have more sense of agency,</p>
<p>I also become more empowered to be more empathetic for others and be more connected to that shared</p>
<p>burden and want to be able to make choices on behalf of and in benefit of.</p>
<p>So this way of living seems like a way of living that would solve a lot of problems</p>
<p>in society from a cellular automata perspective.</p>
<p>So if you have a bunch of little agents behaving in this way, my intuition, there&rsquo;ll be interesting</p>
<p>complexities that emerge, but my intuition is it will create a society that&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>and recognizably better than the one we have today.</p>
<p>How much like&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, wait, hold that question because I want to come back to it, but this brings us back</p>
<p>to Gerard, which we didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>The conflict theory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because about how to get past the conflict theory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know the Robert Frost poem about the two paths and you never have enough time to return</p>
<p>back to the other?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to do that quite a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be living that poem over and over again, but yes, how to&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return back.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the rest of the argument goes, you learn to want what other people want, therefore</p>
<p>fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has.</p>
<p>And then people are in conflict over trying to get the same stuff, power, status, attention,</p>
<p>physical stuff, a mate, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then we learn the conflict by watching.</p>
<p>And so then the conflict becomes metic.</p>
<p>And we become on the Palestinian side or the Israeli side or the communist or capitalist</p>
<p>side or the left or right politically or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type</p>
<p>of violence is needed to get the bad guy, whoever it is that we&rsquo;re going to blame.</p>
<p>And you know, Gerard talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount</p>
<p>of violence.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s blame a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were.</p>
<p>But if we all believe it, then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting concept, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, you beautifully summarized it, but the idea that there&rsquo;s a scapegoat, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this kind of thing naturally leads to a conflict and then they find the other, some group that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the other that&rsquo;s either real or artificial as the cause of the conflict.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s always artificial because the cause of the conflict in Gerard is the mimesis of</p>
<p>desire itself.</p>
<p>And how do we attack that?</p>
<p>How do we attack that it&rsquo;s our own desire?</p>
<p>So this now gets to something more like Buddha said, right, which was desire is the cause</p>
<p>of suffering.</p>
<p>Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in this way.</p>
<p>So but that&rsquo;s that explains I mean, again, it&rsquo;s a compelling description of human history</p>
<p>that we do tend to come up with the other.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>okay, kind of I just I just had such a funny experience with someone critiquing Gerard</p>
<p>the other day in such an elegant and beautiful and simple way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a friend who&rsquo;s grew up Aboriginal Australian, is a scholar of Aboriginal social technologies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, nah man, Gerard just made shit up about how tribes work.</p>
<p>Like we come from a tribe, we&rsquo;ve got tens of thousands of years, and we didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>increasing conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have a little bit of conflict and then we would dance and then everybody&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d dance around the campfire, everyone would like kind of physically get the energy out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d look in each other&rsquo;s eyes, we&rsquo;d have positive bonding, and then we&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>And nobody, no scapegoats.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s called the Joe Rogan theory of desire, which is, he&rsquo;s like, all all of</p>
<p>human problems have to do with the fact that you don&rsquo;t do enough hard shit in your day.</p>
<p>So maybe, maybe just dance it because he says like doing exercise and running on the treadmill</p>
<p>gets gets all the demons out and maybe just dancing gets all the demons out.</p>
<p>So this is why I say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too explanatory</p>
<p>and then taking it as a given and then saying, well, now that we&rsquo;re stuck with the fact that</p>
<p>conflict is inexorable because human, because mimetic desire and therefore, how do we deal</p>
<p>with the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence?</p>
<p>Well, no, the whole thing might be actually gibberish, meaning it&rsquo;s only true in certain</p>
<p>conditions and other conditions it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So the deeper question is under which conditions is that true?</p>
<p>Under which conditions is it not true?</p>
<p>What do those other conditions make possible and look like?</p>
<p>And in general, we should stay away from really compelling models of reality because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something about, about our brains that these models become sticky and we can&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>outside of them.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we stay away from them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we know that the model of reality is never reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>Humility again, it goes back to just having the humility that you don&rsquo;t have a perfect</p>
<p>model of reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ep, the, the model of reality could never be reality.</p>
<p>The process of modeling is inherently information reduction and I can never show that the unknown</p>
<p>unknown set has been factored.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back to the cellular automata.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>Like when you realize it&rsquo;s unfortunately, sadly impossible to, to create a model of</p>
<p>cellular automata, even if you know the basic rules that predict to even any degree of accuracy,</p>
<p>what how that system will evolve, which is fascinating mathematically.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I think about it quite a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very annoying.</p>
<p>Wolfram has this rule 30, like you should be able to predict it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple, but you can&rsquo;t predict what&rsquo;s going to be like, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>he defines, like try to predict some aspect of the middle, middle column of the system,</p>
<p>just anything about it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t, it sucks because then we can&rsquo;t make sense of this world in</p>
<p>a real, in a reality, in a definitive way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like in the striving, like it, we&rsquo;re always striving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this sucks.</p>
<p>That so that&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s assuming a designer.</p>
<p>I would say I don&rsquo;t think it sucks.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not only beautiful, but maybe necessary for beauty.</p>
<p>The mess.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a, so you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re disagree Jordan Pearson should clean up your room.</p>
<p>You like the rooms messy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s essential for the, for beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I take, I have no idea if it was intended this way.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m just interpreting it a way I like the commandment about having no false idols</p>
<p>to me, the way I interpret that that is meaningful is that re reality is sacred to me.</p>
<p>I have a reverence for reality, but I know my best understanding of it is never complete.</p>
<p>I know my best model of it is a model where I tried to make some kind of predictive capacity</p>
<p>by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that I could observe and then a subset</p>
<p>of that stuff that I thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of, you know, mechanisms</p>
<p>that are involved.</p>
<p>And what we find is that it can be super useful, like Newtonian gravity can help us do ballistic</p>
<p>curves and all kinds of super useful stuff.</p>
<p>And then we get to the place where it doesn&rsquo;t explain what&rsquo;s happening at the cosmological</p>
<p>scale or at a quantum scale.</p>
<p>And at each time, what we&rsquo;re finding is we excluded stuff.</p>
<p>And it also doesn&rsquo;t explain the reconciliation of gravity with quantum mechanics and the</p>
<p>other kind of fundamental laws.</p>
<p>So models can be useful, but they&rsquo;re never true with a capital T, meaning they&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>an actual real full, they&rsquo;re never a complete description of what&rsquo;s happening in real systems.</p>
<p>They can be a complete description of what&rsquo;s happening in an artificial system that was</p>
<p>the result of applying a model.</p>
<p>So the model of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing, but I would argue</p>
<p>that the model of a cell and the cell are not the same thing.</p>
<p>And I would say this is key to what we call complexity versus the complicated, which is</p>
<p>a distinction Dave Snowden made well in defining the difference between simple, complicated,</p>
<p>complex and chaotic systems.</p>
<p>But one of the definers in complex systems is that no matter how you model the complex</p>
<p>system, it will still have some emergent behavior not predicted by the model.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated?</p>
<p>Complicated means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>We can program it.</p>
<p>All human, not all, for the most part, human built things are complicated.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t self organize.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t self repair.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them where, sorry, for human</p>
<p>systems, for human technologies, human technologies, that are basically the application of models</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>And engineering is kind of applied science, science as the modeling process.</p>
<p>And but with humans are complex, complex stuff with biological type stuff and sociological</p>
<p>type stuff, it more has generator functions and even those can&rsquo;t be fully explicated than</p>
<p>it has or our explanation can&rsquo;t prove that it has closure of what would be in the unknown</p>
<p>unknown set where we keep finding like, oh, it&rsquo;s just the genome.</p>
<p>Oh, well now it&rsquo;s the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the epigenome</p>
<p>because of the proteome.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s mitochondrial DNA and then viruses affected and fuck, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing.</p>
<p>So on Facebook, you know how you can list your relationship as complicated?</p>
<p>It should actually say it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s complex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more accurate description.</p>
<p>You self terminating is a really interesting idea that you talk about quite a bit.</p>
<p>First of all, what is a self terminating system?</p>
<p>And I think you have a sense, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, that human civilization is a currently</p>
<p>is, is a self terminating system.</p>
<p>Why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what soft self terminating</p>
<p>means?</p>
<p>Okay, so if we look at human societies historically, human civilizations, it&rsquo;s not that hard to</p>
<p>realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>So they had a life cycle, they died for some reason.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t still have the early Egyptian empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any of</p>
<p>those, right?</p>
<p>So they, they terminated, sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside</p>
<p>in war.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems like they self terminated.</p>
<p>When we look at Easter Island, it was a self termination.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go ahead and take an island situation.</p>
<p>If I have an island and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources</p>
<p>can replicate themselves and there&rsquo;s a finite space there, that system is going to self</p>
<p>terminate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be able to keep doing that thing because you&rsquo;ll get to a place of there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no resources left and then you get a, so now if I&rsquo;m utilizing the resources faster than</p>
<p>they can replicate or faster than they can replenish and I&rsquo;m actually growing our population</p>
<p>in the process, I&rsquo;m even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources, I might get</p>
<p>an exponential curve and then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather</p>
<p>than do an S curve or some other kind of thing.</p>
<p>So self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate system that is debasing</p>
<p>its own substrate, that is debasing what it depends upon.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right that if you look at empires, they rise and fall throughout human history,</p>
<p>but not this time, bro.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s going to last forever.</p>
<p>I like that idea.</p>
<p>I think that if we don&rsquo;t understand why all the previous ones failed, we can&rsquo;t ensure</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s very important to understand it well so that we can have that be a designed</p>
<p>outcome with somewhat decent probability.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s sort of in terms of consuming the resources on the island, we&rsquo;re a clever</p>
<p>bunch and we keep coming up, especially when on the horizon there is a termination point,</p>
<p>we keep coming up with clever ways of avoiding disaster, of avoiding collapse, of constructing.</p>
<p>This is where technological innovation, this is where growth comes in, coming up with different</p>
<p>ways to improve productivity and the way society functions such that we consume less resources</p>
<p>or get a lot more from the resources we have.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sense in which there&rsquo;s a human ingenuity is a source for optimism about the</p>
<p>future of this particular system that may not be self terminating.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s more innovation than there is consumption.</p>
<p>So overconsumption of resources is just one way I think can self terminate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just kind of starting here.</p>
<p>But there are reasons for optimism and pessimism then they&rsquo;re both worth understanding and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s failure modes on understanding either without the other.</p>
<p>As we mentioned previously, there&rsquo;s what I would call naive techno optimism, naive techno</p>
<p>capital optimism that says stuff just has been getting better and better and we wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and we know the</p>
<p>proponents of those models and this stuff is going to kind of keep getting better.</p>
<p>Of course there are problems, but human ingenuity rises to its supply and demand will solve</p>
<p>the problems, whatever.</p>
<p>Would you put Rick or as well in that, or in that bucket, is there some specific people</p>
<p>you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you&rsquo;re essentially just have</p>
<p>an optimism that&rsquo;s blind to any kind of realities of the way technology progresses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>But there might be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platonic ideal.</p>
<p>There might be a bias in the nature of the assessment.</p>
<p>I would also say there&rsquo;s kind of naive techno pessimism and there are critics of technology.</p>
<p>I mean, you read the Unabomber&rsquo;s Manifesto on why technology can&rsquo;t not result in our</p>
<p>self termination, so we have to take it out before it gets any further.</p>
<p>But also if you read a lot of the X risk community, you know, Bostrom and friends, it&rsquo;s like our</p>
<p>total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up.</p>
<p>And so I think that there are, we have to hold together where our positive possibilities</p>
<p>and our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities</p>
<p>to be realized long term, all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen.</p>
<p>Any of the catastrophic risks happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from</p>
<p>occurring.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that none of them happen?</p>
<p>If we want to say, let&rsquo;s have a civilization that doesn&rsquo;t collapse.</p>
<p>So again, Collapse Theory, it&rsquo;s worth looking at books like The Collapse of Complex Societies</p>
<p>by Joseph Tainter.</p>
<p>It does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional decay, civilizational</p>
<p>decay reasons.</p>
<p>Baudrillard in Simulation and Simulacra looks at a very different way of looking at how</p>
<p>institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and it becomes kind of</p>
<p>more internally parasitic on itself.</p>
<p>Obviously Jared Diamond made a more popular book called Collapse.</p>
<p>And as we were mentioning, the anticatheria mechanism has been getting attention in the</p>
<p>news lately.</p>
<p>It was like a 2000 year old clock, right?</p>
<p>Like metal gears.</p>
<p>And does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress?</p>
<p>And from a society that was relatively technologically advanced.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m interested in here is being able to say, okay, well, why did previous societies</p>
<p>fail?</p>
<p>Can we understand that abstractly enough that we can make a civilizational model that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just trying to solve one type of failure, but solve the underlying things that generate</p>
<p>the failures as a whole?</p>
<p>Are there some underlying generator functions or patterns that would make a system self</p>
<p>terminating?</p>
<p>And can we solve those and have that be the kernel of a new civilizational model that</p>
<p>is not self terminating?</p>
<p>And can we then be able to actually look at the categories of extras we&rsquo;re aware of and</p>
<p>see that we actually have resilience in the presence of those?</p>
<p>Not just resilience, but antifragility.</p>
<p>And I would say for the optimism to be grounded, it has to actually be able to understand the</p>
<p>risk space well and have adequate solutions for it.</p>
<p>So can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic</p>
<p>failures of the system and overconsumption that&rsquo;s built in into self terminating systems?</p>
<p>So both the overconsumption, which is like the slow death, and then there&rsquo;s the fast</p>
<p>death of nuclear war and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>AGI, biotech, bioengineering, nanotechnology, nano, my favorite nanobots.</p>
<p>Nanobots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that I could just know that</p>
<p>I would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without</p>
<p>sufficiently thinking about the negative consequences.</p>
<p>I would definitely be, I would be podcasting all about the negative consequences, but when</p>
<p>I go back home, I&rsquo;d be, I&rsquo;d just in my heart know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant</p>
<p>of ape, no offense to apes.</p>
<p>I want to backtrack on my previous comments about, negative comments about apes.</p>
<p>That I have that sense of excitement that would result in problems.</p>
<p>So sorry, a lot of things said, but what&rsquo;s, can we start to pull it a thread because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also provided a kind of a beautiful general approach to this, which is this dialectic</p>
<p>synthesis or just rigorous empathy, whatever, whatever word we want to put to it, that seems</p>
<p>to be from the individual perspective as one way to sort of live in the world as we tried</p>
<p>to figure out how to construct non self terminating systems.</p>
<p>So what, what are some underlying sources?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First I have to say, I actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing Grey Goo and engines</p>
<p>of creation back in the day to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to the</p>
<p>risks of the nanotech as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t focus on the risks or pretend there aren&rsquo;t risks because they get to market first.</p>
<p>And then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is</p>
<p>to the commons or wherever happen to have it.</p>
<p>Other people are going to have to solve those, but now they have the power and capital associated.</p>
<p>The person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design and go slower is probably</p>
<p>not going to move into positions of as much power influences quickly.</p>
<p>So this is one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the bad game theoretic dispositions</p>
<p>in the system relative to its own stability.</p>
<p>And the key aspect to that, sorry to interrupt, is the externalities generated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream?</p>
<p>So mine is coconut.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to like coconut ice cream.</p>
<p>So ice cream aside, what are you most worried about in terms of catastrophic risk that will</p>
<p>help us kind of make concrete the discussion we&rsquo;re having about how to fix this whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just kind of orient everyone to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go all the way back to the aliens who&rsquo;ve seen all of civilization.</p>
<p>But to just recognize that for all of human history, as far as we&rsquo;re aware, there were</p>
<p>existential risks to civilizations and they happened, right?</p>
<p>Like there were civilizations that were killed in war, tribes that were killed in tribal</p>
<p>warfare or whatever.</p>
<p>So people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just those were local phenomena, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fully global phenomena.</p>
<p>So an empire could fall and surrounding empires didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>Maybe they came in and filled the space.</p>
<p>The first time that we were able to think about catastrophic risk, not from like a solar</p>
<p>flare or something that we couldn&rsquo;t control, but from something that humans would actually</p>
<p>create at a global level was World War II and the bomb.</p>
<p>Because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually mess up</p>
<p>everything at a global level that could mess up habitability.</p>
<p>We just weren&rsquo;t powerful enough to do that before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t behave in ways that would have done it.</p>
<p>We just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s important to get that there&rsquo;s the entire world before World War II where</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the ability to make a nonhabitable biosphere, nonhabitable for us.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s World War II and the beginning of a completely new phase where global human</p>
<p>induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing.</p>
<p>And that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way,</p>
<p>which is, you know, when you study history, it&rsquo;s amazing how big a percentage of history</p>
<p>is studying war, right, and the history of war, as you said, European history and whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generals and wars and empire expansions.</p>
<p>And so the major empires near each other never had really long periods of time where they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t engaged in war or preparation for war or something like that was ‚Äì humans</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a good precedent in the post tribal phase, the civilization phase of being able</p>
<p>to solve conflicts without war for very long.</p>
<p>World War II was the first time where we could have a war that no one could win.</p>
<p>And so the superpowers couldn&rsquo;t fight again.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t do a real kinetic war.</p>
<p>They could do diplomatic wars and Cold War type stuff and they could fight proxy wars</p>
<p>through other countries that didn&rsquo;t have the big weapons.</p>
<p>And so mutually assured destruction and like coming out of World War II, we actually realized</p>
<p>that nation states couldn&rsquo;t prevent world war.</p>
<p>And so we needed a new type of supervening government in addition to nation states, which</p>
<p>was the whole Bretton Woods world, the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, the globalization</p>
<p>trade type agreements, mutually assured destruction that was how do we have some coordination</p>
<p>beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at least the superpowers.</p>
<p>And it was pretty successful given that we&rsquo;ve had like 75 years of no superpower on superpower</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had lots of proxy wars during that time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had Cold War.</p>
<p>And I would say we&rsquo;re in a new phase now where the Bretton Woods solution is basically over</p>
<p>or almost over.</p>
<p>Can you describe the Bretton Woods solution?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the Bretton Woods, the series of agreements for how the nations would be able to engage</p>
<p>with each other in a solution other than war was these IGOs, these intergovernmental organizations</p>
<p>and was the idea of globalization.</p>
<p>Since we could have global effects, we needed to be able to think about things globally</p>
<p>where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable to</p>
<p>war with each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other.</p>
<p>So our own self interest was gonna drive our non war interest.</p>
<p>And so this started to look like, and obviously this couldn&rsquo;t have happened that much earlier</p>
<p>either because industrialization hadn&rsquo;t gotten far enough to be able to do massive global</p>
<p>industrial supply chains and ship stuff around quickly.</p>
<p>But like we were mentioning earlier, almost all the electronics that we use today, just</p>
<p>basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents, made in many countries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that</p>
<p>we have and from the raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the et cetera.</p>
<p>And so the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive</p>
<p>GDP growth, we could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>With the rapid GDP growth, there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without</p>
<p>having to take each other&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>And so that was part of kind of the Bretton Woods post World War II model.</p>
<p>The other was that we&rsquo;d be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up</p>
<p>would never make sense.</p>
<p>That worked for a while.</p>
<p>Now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster, the unrenewable use of resource and</p>
<p>turning those resources into pollution on the other side of the supply chain.</p>
<p>So obviously that faster GDP growth meant the overfishing of the oceans and the cutting</p>
<p>down of the trees and the climate change and the mining, toxic mining tailings going into</p>
<p>the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the overconsumption side of the risk that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And so the answer of let&rsquo;s do positive GDP is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously</p>
<p>accelerated the planetary boundary side.</p>
<p>And that started to be, that was thought about for a long time, but it started to be modeled</p>
<p>with the Club of Rome and limits of growth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just very obvious to say if you have a linear materials economy where you take</p>
<p>stuff out of the earth faster, whether it&rsquo;s fish or trees or oil, you take it out of the</p>
<p>earth faster than it can replenish itself and you turn it into trash after using it</p>
<p>for a short period of time, you put the trash in the environment faster than it can process</p>
<p>itself and there&rsquo;s toxicity associated with both sides of this.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a hard thing to figure out.</p>
<p>And it has to be exponential if there&rsquo;s an exponentiation in the monetary supply because</p>
<p>of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to keep up with the growing</p>
<p>monetary supply, you have to have growth of goods and services.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that kind of thing that has happened.</p>
<p>But you also see that when you get these supply chains that are so interconnected across the</p>
<p>world, you get increased fragility because a collapse or a problem in one area then affects</p>
<p>the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues being local, right?</p>
<p>So we got to see with COVID and an issue that started in one part of China affecting the</p>
<p>whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before Bretton Woods, right?</p>
<p>Before international travel, supply chains, you know, that whole kind of thing and with</p>
<p>a bunch of second and third order effects that people wouldn&rsquo;t have predicted, okay,</p>
<p>we have to stop certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants, but the countries doing</p>
<p>agriculture depend upon fertilizer they don&rsquo;t produce that is shipped into them and depend</p>
<p>upon pesticides they don&rsquo;t produce.</p>
<p>So we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in Northern Africa</p>
<p>and Iran and things like that because they couldn&rsquo;t get the supplies of stuff in.</p>
<p>So then you get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain</p>
<p>shutdowns.</p>
<p>So you get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up</p>
<p>leading to cascade effects.</p>
<p>And also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same catastrophe</p>
<p>weapon is there&rsquo;s more countries that have it, eight or nine countries that have it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot more types of catastrophe weapons.</p>
<p>We now have catastrophe weapons with weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets</p>
<p>with bio, with in fact every new type of tech has created an arms race.</p>
<p>So we have not with the UN or the other kind of intergovernmental organizations, we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to really do nuclear de proliferation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually had more countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes, the race to</p>
<p>hypersonics and things like that.</p>
<p>And every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with</p>
<p>two agents.</p>
<p>Two agents, it&rsquo;s much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that&rsquo;s forced.</p>
<p>But the ability to monitor and say if these guys shoot, who do I shoot?</p>
<p>Do I shoot them?</p>
<p>Do I shoot everybody?</p>
<p>Do I?</p>
<p>And so you get a three body problem.</p>
<p>You get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and multiple different</p>
<p>types of catastrophe weapons, including ones that can be much more easily produced than</p>
<p>nukes.</p>
<p>Nukes are really hard to produce.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only uranium in a few areas.</p>
<p>uranium enrichment is hard, ICBMs are hard, but weaponized drones hitting smart targets</p>
<p>is not so hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture them</p>
<p>is going way, way down to where even non state actors can have them.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech,</p>
<p>what that means is decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity.</p>
<p>And especially in a world of increasing numbers of people feeling disenfranchised, frantic,</p>
<p>whatever for different reasons.</p>
<p>So I would say where the Bretton Woods world doesn&rsquo;t prepare us to be able to deal with</p>
<p>lots of different agents, having lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>mutually assured destruction on, where you can&rsquo;t keep doing growth of materials economy</p>
<p>in the same way because of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics</p>
<p>are actually now their own source of catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re, so like there was all the world until world war II and world war II is just</p>
<p>from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago.</p>
<p>It seems like a long time, but it is really not.</p>
<p>We get a short period of relative peace at the level of superpowers while building up</p>
<p>the military capacity for much, much, much worse war the entire time.</p>
<p>And then now we&rsquo;re at this new phase where the things that allowed us to make it through</p>
<p>the nuclear power are not the same systems that will let us make it through the next</p>
<p>stage.</p>
<p>So what is this next post Bretton Woods?</p>
<p>How do we become safe vessels, safe stewards of many different types of exponential technology</p>
<p>is a key question when we&rsquo;re thinking about X risk.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to try to answer the how a few ways, but first on the mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>Do you give credit to the idea of two superpowers now blowing each other up with nuclear weapons</p>
<p>to the simple game theoretic model of mutually assured destruction or something you&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>previously this idea of inverse correlation, which I tend to believe between the, now you</p>
<p>were talking about tech, but I think it&rsquo;s maybe broadly true.</p>
<p>The inverse correlation between competence and propensity for destruction.</p>
<p>So the better, the, the, the bigger your weapons, not because you&rsquo;re afraid of a mutually assured</p>
<p>self destruction, but because we&rsquo;re human beings and there&rsquo;s a deep moral fortitude</p>
<p>there that somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hard to be a psychopath and be good at killing at scale.</p>
<p>Do you share any of that intuition?</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I think most people would say that Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan and Napoleon were</p>
<p>effective people that were good at their job that were actually maybe asymmetrically good</p>
<p>at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were pretty oriented</p>
<p>towards certain types of destruction or pretty willing to, maybe they would say they were</p>
<p>oriented towards empire expansion, but pretty willing to commit certain acts of destruction</p>
<p>in the name of it.</p>
<p>What are you worried about?</p>
<p>The Genghis Khan, or you could argue he&rsquo;s not a psychopath.</p>
<p>That are you worried about Genghis Khan, are you worried about Hitler or are you worried</p>
<p>about a terrorist who is, has a very different ethic, which is not even for, it&rsquo;s not trying</p>
<p>to preserve and build and expand my community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about just the destruction in itself is the goal.</p>
<p>I think the thing that you&rsquo;re looking at that I do agree with is that there&rsquo;s a psychological</p>
<p>disposition towards construction and a psychological disposition more towards destruction.</p>
<p>Obviously everybody has both and can toggle between both and oftentimes one is willing</p>
<p>to destroy certain things.</p>
<p>We have this idea of creative destruction, right?</p>
<p>Willing to destroy certain things to create other things and utilitarianism and trolley</p>
<p>problems are all about exploring that space and the idea of war is all about that.</p>
<p>I am trying to create something for our people and it requires destroying some other people.</p>
<p>Sociopathy is a funny topic because it&rsquo;s possible to have very high fealty to your in group</p>
<p>and work on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group at the same time because</p>
<p>you can dehumanize and then remove empathy.</p>
<p>And I would also say that there are types.</p>
<p>So the reason, the thing that gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction</p>
<p>being a little different in psychology is what it takes to build really catastrophic</p>
<p>tech, even today where it doesn&rsquo;t take what it took to make a nuke, a small group of people</p>
<p>could do it, takes still some real technical knowledge that required having studied for</p>
<p>a while and some then building capacity and there&rsquo;s a question of is that psychologically</p>
<p>inversely correlated with the desire to damage civilization meaningfully?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit, I think.</p>
<p>I think a lot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually, I mean, this is the conversation I had like with, I think offline</p>
<p>with Dan Carlin, which is like, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent,</p>
<p>I can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a lot of people and it&rsquo;s pretty easy, like I</p>
<p>alone could do it and there&rsquo;s a lot of people as smart or smarter than me, at least in their</p>
<p>creation of explosives.</p>
<p>Why are we not seeing more insane mass murder?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something fascinating and beautiful about this and it does have to do</p>
<p>with some deeply pro social types of characteristics in humans but when you&rsquo;re dealing with very</p>
<p>large numbers, you don&rsquo;t need a whole lot of a phenomena and so then you start to say,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the probability that X won&rsquo;t happen this year, then won&rsquo;t happen in the</p>
<p>next two years, three years, four years and then how many people are doing destructive</p>
<p>things with lower tech and then how many of them can get access to higher tech that they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to figure out how to build.</p>
<p>So when I can get commercial tech and maybe I don&rsquo;t understand tech very well but I understand</p>
<p>it well enough to utilize it, not to create it and I can repurpose it.</p>
<p>When we saw that commercial drone with a homemade thermite bomb hit the Ukrainian munitions</p>
<p>factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary bomb level of damage, that was just home tech,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just simple kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so the question is not does it stay being a small percentage of the population?</p>
<p>The question is can you bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now as you</p>
<p>start to get into bigger things, CRISPR gene drive technologies and various things like</p>
<p>that, can you bind it completely long term over what period of time?</p>
<p>Not perfectly though, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say that there is some, let&rsquo;s call it, that&rsquo;s a random word, love, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inherent and that&rsquo;s core to human nature that&rsquo;s preventing destruction at scale.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying yeah but there&rsquo;s a lot of humans, there&rsquo;s going to be eight plus billion</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a lot of seconds in the day to come up with stuff, there&rsquo;s a lot of pain</p>
<p>in the world that can lead to a distorted view of the world such that you want to channel</p>
<p>that pain into the destruction, all those kinds of things and it&rsquo;s only a matter of</p>
<p>time that any one individual can do large damage, especially as we create more and more</p>
<p>democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>build the initial weapon.</p>
<p>But the thing is it seems like it&rsquo;s a race between the cheapening of destructive weapons</p>
<p>and the capacity of humans to express their love towards each other and it&rsquo;s a race that</p>
<p>so far, I know on Twitter it&rsquo;s not popular to say but love is winning, okay?</p>
<p>So what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear weapons and biotech</p>
<p>and AI and drones?</p>
<p>Okay I&rsquo;m going to comment the end of this to a how love wins so I just want you to know</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m oriented.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the end, okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to argue against why that is a given because it&rsquo;s not a given, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe and I think that it&rsquo;s‚Ä¶</p>
<p>This is like a good romantic comedy so you&rsquo;re going to create drama right now but it will</p>
<p>end in a happy ending.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s only a happy ending if we actually understand the issues well</p>
<p>enough and take responsibility to shift it.</p>
<p>Do I believe like there&rsquo;s a reason why there&rsquo;s so much more dystopic sci fi than protopic</p>
<p>sci fi and the some protopic sci fi usually requires magic is because ‚Äì or at least</p>
<p>magical tech, right, dilithium crystals and warp drives and stuff because it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to imagine people like the people we have been in the history books with exponential</p>
<p>type technology and power that don&rsquo;t eventually blow themselves up, that make good enough</p>
<p>choices as stewards of their environment and their commons and each other and etc.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it is to think</p>
<p>of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up.</p>
<p>And when I say blow ourselves up I mean the environmental versions, the terrorist versions,</p>
<p>the war versions, the cumulative externalities versions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;m interrupting your flow of thought but why is it easier?</p>
<p>Could it be a weird psychological thing where we either are just more capable to visualize</p>
<p>explosions and destruction and then the sicker thought which is like we kind of enjoy for</p>
<p>some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff even though we wouldn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>act on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like some weird, like I love playing shooter games, you know, first person shooters</p>
<p>and like especially if it&rsquo;s like murdering zombies and doom, you&rsquo;re shooting demons.</p>
<p>I play one of my favorite games Diablo is like slashing through different monsters and</p>
<p>the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then I go out into the real world to eat my</p>
<p>coconut ice cream and I&rsquo;m all about love.</p>
<p>So like can we trust our ability to visualize how it all goes to shit as an actual rational</p>
<p>way of thinking?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fair question to say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy</p>
<p>and morbid exploration and whatever else that happens in our imagination but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole of it.</p>
<p>I think there is also a reality to the combinatorial possibility space and the difference in the</p>
<p>probabilities that there&rsquo;s a lot of ways I could try to put the 70 trillion cells of</p>
<p>your body together that don&rsquo;t make you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that many ways I can put them together that make you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways I could try to connect the organs together that make some weird kind</p>
<p>of group of organs on a desk but that doesn&rsquo;t actually make a functioning human and you</p>
<p>can kill an adult human in a second but you can&rsquo;t get one in a second.</p>
<p>It takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things happen right.</p>
<p>I could destroy this building in a couple of minutes with demolition but it took a year</p>
<p>or a couple of years to build it.</p>
<p>There is ‚Äì</p>
<p>Calm down, Cole.</p>
<p>This is just an example.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mean it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gradient where entropy is easier and there&rsquo;s a lot more ways to put a set</p>
<p>of things together that don&rsquo;t work than the few that really do produce higher order</p>
<p>synergies.</p>
<p>When we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful warfare,</p>
<p>an arms race that drives that in all these directions, and when we look at a history</p>
<p>of environmental destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential</p>
<p>externalities multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it and the cumulative</p>
<p>effects, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways the whole thing can break, like a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>And for it to get ahead, it has to have none of those happen.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s just a probability space where it&rsquo;s easier to imagine that thing.</p>
<p>So to say how do we have a protopic future, we have to say, well, one criteria must be</p>
<p>that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks.</p>
<p>So can we understand ‚Äì can we inventory all the catastrophic risks?</p>
<p>Can we inventory the patterns of human behavior that give rise to them?</p>
<p>And could we try to solve for that?</p>
<p>And could we have that be the essence of the social technology that we&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>to be able to guide, bind, and direct a new physical technology?</p>
<p>Because so far, our physical technology ‚Äì like we were talking about the Genghis Khan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that, that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments and also</p>
<p>social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes.</p>
<p>But we have things that don&rsquo;t look like warfare, like Rockefeller and Standard Oil.</p>
<p>And it looked like a constructive mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource</p>
<p>to the world, and it did.</p>
<p>And the second order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have</p>
<p>happened and will happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have</p>
<p>been there and the massive political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated</p>
<p>with it and on and on, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus</p>
<p>on what I&rsquo;m trying to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third</p>
<p>order effects I&rsquo;m not taking responsibility for.</p>
<p>You often on another tangent mentioned second, third, and fourth order effects.</p>
<p>And order.</p>
<p>Cascading.</p>
<p>Which is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Like starting with the third order plus it gets really interesting because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even acknowledge like the second order effects.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But like thinking because those it could get bigger and bigger and bigger in ways we were</p>
<p>not anticipating.</p>
<p>So how do we make those?</p>
<p>So it sounds like part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution</p>
<p>how to create an anti fragile, a resilient society is to make explicit acknowledge, understand</p>
<p>the externalities, the second order, third order, fourth order, and the order effects.</p>
<p>How do we start to think about those effects?</p>
<p>Yeah, the war application is harm we&rsquo;re trying to cause or that we&rsquo;re aware we&rsquo;re causing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The externality is harm that at least supposedly we&rsquo;re not aware we&rsquo;re causing or at minimum</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not our intention.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re either totally unaware of it or we&rsquo;re aware of it but it is a side effect</p>
<p>of what our intention is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the intention itself.</p>
<p>There are catastrophic risks from both types.</p>
<p>The direct application of increased technological power to a rivalrous intent which is going</p>
<p>to cause harm for some out group, for some in group to win.</p>
<p>But the out group is also working on growing the tech and if they don&rsquo;t lose completely</p>
<p>they reverse engineer the tech, up regulate it, come back with more capacity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the exponential tech arms race side of in group, out group rivalry using</p>
<p>exponential tech that is one set of risks.</p>
<p>And the other set of risks is the application of exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally</p>
<p>to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve some goal that we have but to produce</p>
<p>a second and third order effects that do have harm to the commons, to other people, to environment,</p>
<p>to other groups that might actually be bigger problems than the problem we were originally</p>
<p>trying to solve with the thing we were building.</p>
<p>When Facebook was building a dating app and then building a social app where people could</p>
<p>tag pictures, they weren&rsquo;t trying to build a democracy destroying app that would maximize</p>
<p>time on site as part of its ad model through AI optimization of a newsfeed to the thing</p>
<p>that made people spend most time on site which is usually them being limbically hijacked</p>
<p>more than something else which ends up appealing to people&rsquo;s cognitive biases and group identities</p>
<p>and creates no sense of shared reality.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t trying to do that but it was a second order effect and it&rsquo;s a pretty fucking</p>
<p>powerful second order effect and a pretty fast one because the rate of tech is obviously</p>
<p>able to get distributed to much larger scale much faster and with a bigger jump in terms</p>
<p>of total vertical capacity than that&rsquo;s what it means to get to the verticalizing part</p>
<p>of an exponential curve.</p>
<p>So just like we can see that oil had the second order environmental effects and also social</p>
<p>and political effects.</p>
<p>War and so much of the whole like the total amount of oil used has a proportionality to</p>
<p>total global GDP and this is why we have this the petrodollar and so the oil thing also</p>
<p>had the externalities of a major aspect of what happened with military industrial complex</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But we can see the same thing with more current technologies with Facebook and Google and</p>
<p>other things.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we can run and the more powerful the tech is, we build it for reason X, whatever</p>
<p>reason X is.</p>
<p>Maybe X is three things, maybe it&rsquo;s one thing, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing the oil thing because we wanna make cars because it&rsquo;s a better method of</p>
<p>individual transportation, we&rsquo;re building the Facebook thing because we&rsquo;re gonna connect</p>
<p>people socially in a personal sphere.</p>
<p>But it interacts with complex systems, with ecologies, economies, psychologies, cultures,</p>
<p>and so it has effects on other than the thing we&rsquo;re intending.</p>
<p>Some of those effects can end up being negative effects, but because this technology, if we</p>
<p>make it to solve a problem, it has to overcome the problem.</p>
<p>The problem has been around for a while, it&rsquo;s gonna overcome in a short period of time.</p>
<p>So it usually has greater scale, greater rate of magnitude in some way.</p>
<p>That also means that the externalities that it creates might be bigger problems.</p>
<p>And you can say, well, but then that&rsquo;s the new problem and humanity will innovate its</p>
<p>way out of that.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s paying attention to the fact that we can&rsquo;t keep up with exponential</p>
<p>curves like that, nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever.</p>
<p>And this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking, well, no,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re totally screwed unless we can make a benevolent AI singleton that rules all</p>
<p>of us.</p>
<p>Guys like Ostrom and others thinking in those directions, because they&rsquo;re like, how do humans</p>
<p>try to do multipolarity and make it work?</p>
<p>And I have a different answer of what I think it looks like that does have more to do with</p>
<p>love, but some applied social tech aligned with love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, because I have a bunch of really dumb ideas I&rsquo;d prefer to hear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear some of them first.</p>
<p>I think the idea I would have is to be a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount</p>
<p>of love you add or subtract from the world in second, third, fourth, fifth order effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, I think, especially in the world of tech, quite doable.</p>
<p>You just might not like, the shareholders may not like that kind of metric, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty easy to measure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even, I&rsquo;m perhaps half joking about love, but we could talk about just happiness</p>
<p>and well being, long term well being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty easy for Facebook, for YouTube, for all these companies to measure that.</p>
<p>They do a lot of kinds of surveys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very simple solutions here that you could just survey how, I mean, servers are</p>
<p>in some sense useless because they&rsquo;re a subset of the population.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to get a sense, it&rsquo;s very loose kind of understanding, but integrated</p>
<p>deeply as part of the technology.</p>
<p>Most of our tech is recommender systems.</p>
<p>Most of the, sorry, not tech, online interactions driven by recommender systems that learn very</p>
<p>little data about you and use that data based on, mostly based on traces of your previous</p>
<p>behavior to suggest future things.</p>
<p>This is how Twitter, this is how Facebook works.</p>
<p>This is how AdSense or Google AdSense works, this is how Netflix, YouTube work and so on.</p>
<p>And for them to just track as opposed to engagement, how much you spend in a particular video,</p>
<p>a particular site, is also track, give you the technology to do self report of what makes</p>
<p>you feel good, what makes you grow as a person, of what makes you, you know, the best version</p>
<p>of yourself, the Rogan idea of the hero of your movie.</p>
<p>And just add that little bit of information.</p>
<p>If you have people, you have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five</p>
<p>days, how would you report your experience.</p>
<p>You can lay out the set of videos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating, I don&rsquo;t know if you ever look at YouTube, the history of videos</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve looked at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very embarrassing for me.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that I don&rsquo;t want anyone to</p>
<p>know about, which is, which is, which will be like, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe like five videos</p>
<p>in a row where it looks like I watched the whole thing, which I probably did about like</p>
<p>how to cook a steak, even though, or just like with the best chefs in the world cooking</p>
<p>steaks and I&rsquo;m just like sitting there watching it for no purpose whatsoever, wasting away</p>
<p>my life or like funny cat videos or like legit, that&rsquo;s always a good one.</p>
<p>And I could look back and rate which videos made me a better person and not.</p>
<p>And I mean, on a more serious note, there&rsquo;s a bunch of conversations, podcasts or lectures</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched, which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse person.</p>
<p>And honestly, not for stupid reasons, like I feel dumber, but because I do have a sense</p>
<p>that that started me on a path of, of not being kind to other people.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ll give you a, for my own, and I&rsquo;m sorry for ranting, but maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self.</p>
<p>When I focus on creating, on programming, on science, I become a much deeper thinker</p>
<p>and a kinder person to others.</p>
<p>When I listen to too many, a little bit is good, but too many podcasts or videos about</p>
<p>how, how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people, the worst of the quote</p>
<p>unquote woke, for example.</p>
<p>All there&rsquo;s all these groups that are misbehaving in fascinating ways because they&rsquo;ve been corrupted</p>
<p>by power.</p>
<p>The more I watch, the more I watch criticism of them, the worse I become.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware of this, but I&rsquo;m also aware that for some reason it&rsquo;s pleasant to watch</p>
<p>those sometimes.</p>
<p>And so for, for me to be able to self report that to the YouTube algorithm, to the systems</p>
<p>around me, and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best person, the best version</p>
<p>of myself, which I personally believe would make YouTube a lot more money because I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be much more willing to spend time on YouTube and give YouTube a lot more, a lot more of</p>
<p>my money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s great for business and great for humanity because it&rsquo;ll make me a kinder</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll increase the love quotient, the love metric, and it&rsquo;ll make them a lot of money.</p>
<p>I feel like everything&rsquo;s aligned.</p>
<p>And so you, you should do that not just for YouTube algorithm, but also for military strategy</p>
<p>and whether you go to war or not, because one externality you can think of about going</p>
<p>to war, which I think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of governments</p>
<p>with a, with, not with the people.</p>
<p>You have to think about the kids of countries that see a soldier and because of what they</p>
<p>experienced the interaction with the soldier, hate is born.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re like eight years old, six years old, you lose your dad, you lose your mom,</p>
<p>you lose a friend, somebody close to you that want a really powerful externality that could</p>
<p>be reduced to love, positive and negative is the hate that&rsquo;s born when you make decisions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that</p>
<p>then leads to the kind of destruction that we talk about.</p>
<p>So but in my sense, it&rsquo;s possible to reduce everything to a measure of how much love does</p>
<p>this add to the world.</p>
<p>All that to say, do you have ideas of how we practically build systems that create a</p>
<p>resilient society?</p>
<p>There were a lot of good things that you shared where there&rsquo;s like 15 different ways that</p>
<p>we could enter this that are all interesting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to see which one will probably be most useful.</p>
<p>Pick the one or two things that are least ridiculous.</p>
<p>When you were mentioning if we could see some of the second order effects or externalities</p>
<p>that we aren&rsquo;t used to seeing, specifically the one of a kid being radicalized somewhere</p>
<p>else, which engenders enmity in them towards us, which decreases our own future security.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t care about the kid, if you care about the kid, it&rsquo;s a whole other thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think when we saw this, when Jane Fonda and others went to Vietnam and</p>
<p>took photos and videos of what was happening, and you got to see the pictures of the kids</p>
<p>with napalm on them, that like the antiwar effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have been without that.</p>
<p>Until we can see the images, you can&rsquo;t have a mere neuron effect in the same way.</p>
<p>And when you can, that starts to have a powerful effect.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a deep principle that you&rsquo;re sharing there, which is that if we can have</p>
<p>a rivalrous intent where our in group, whatever it is, maybe it&rsquo;s our political party wanting</p>
<p>to win within the US, maybe it&rsquo;s our nation state wanting to win in a war or an economic</p>
<p>war over resource or whatever it is, that if we don&rsquo;t obliterate the other people completely,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go away, they&rsquo;re not engendered to like us more, they didn&rsquo;t become less smart.</p>
<p>So they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies we employed to be successful,</p>
<p>they will now reverse engineer, make iterations on and come back.</p>
<p>And so you drive an arms race, which is why you can see that the wars were over history</p>
<p>employing more lethal weaponry.</p>
<p>And not just the kinetic war, the information war and the narrative war and the economic</p>
<p>war, like it just increased capacity in all of those fronts.</p>
<p>And so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses</p>
<p>in the long term.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned with</p>
<p>everyone else because we inter affect each other.</p>
<p>And I think the thing about globalism, globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which</p>
<p>we affect each other and the rate at which we affect the biosphere that we&rsquo;re all affected</p>
<p>by is that this kind of proverbial spiritual idea that we&rsquo;re all interconnected and need</p>
<p>to think about that in some way, that was easy for tribes to get because everyone in</p>
<p>the tribes so clearly saw their interconnection and dependence on each other.</p>
<p>But in terms of a global level, the speed at which we are actually interconnected, the</p>
<p>speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or</p>
<p>a new technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue</p>
<p>or whatever is making it to where we either actually all get, not as a spiritual idea,</p>
<p>just even as physics, right?</p>
<p>We all get the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that and see</p>
<p>how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere end up becoming decreased</p>
<p>quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think people are beginning to experience that at the individual level?</p>
<p>So governments are resisting it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to make us not empathize with each other, feel connected.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think people are beginning to feel more and more connected?</p>
<p>Like isn&rsquo;t that exactly what the technology is enabling?</p>
<p>Like social networks, we tend to criticize them, but isn&rsquo;t there a sense which we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>experiencing, you know?</p>
<p>When you watch those videos that are criticizing, whether it&rsquo;s the woke Antifa side or the QAnon</p>
<p>Trump supporter side, does it seem like they have increased empathy for people that are</p>
<p>outside of their ideologic camp?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of the populace.</p>
<p>I tend to see those videos as feeding something that&rsquo;s a relic of the past.</p>
<p>They figured out that drama fuels clicks, but whether I&rsquo;m right or wrong, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I tend to sense that that is not, that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human</p>
<p>beings that we want to actually, that we want to understand Antifa and we want to empathize.</p>
<p>We want to take radical ideas and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s look at cultural outliers in terms of violence versus compassion.</p>
<p>We can see that a lot of cultures have relatively lower in group violence, bigger out group</p>
<p>violence, and there&rsquo;s some variance in them and variance at different times based on the</p>
<p>scarcity or abundance of resource and other things.</p>
<p>But you can look at say, Janes, whose whole religion is around nonviolence so much so</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t even hurt plants, they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff.</p>
<p>Or to go to a larger population, you could take Buddhists, where for the most part, with</p>
<p>a few exceptions, for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different</p>
<p>countries and geographies and whatever, you have 10 million people plus or minus who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hurt bugs.</p>
<p>The whole spectrum of genetic variance that is happening within a culture of that many</p>
<p>people and head traumas and whatever, and nobody hurts bugs.</p>
<p>And then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers in Liberia or Darfur</p>
<p>were to make it to adulthood, pretty much everybody&rsquo;s killed people hand to hand and</p>
<p>killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people.</p>
<p>And you say, okay, so we were very neotenous, we can be conditioned by our environment and</p>
<p>humans can be conditioned where almost all the humans show up in these two different</p>
<p>bell curves.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Buddhists had no violence, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that these people</p>
<p>had no compassion, but they&rsquo;re very different Gaussian distributions.</p>
<p>And so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at the examples</p>
<p>of the populations, what Buddhism shows regarding compassion or what Judaism shows around education,</p>
<p>the average level of education that everybody gets because of a culture that is really working</p>
<p>on conditioning it or various cultures.</p>
<p>What are the positive deviance outside of the statistical deviance to see what is actually</p>
<p>possible and then say, what are the conditioning factors and can we condition those across</p>
<p>a few of them simultaneously and could we build a civilization like that becomes a very</p>
<p>interesting question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of real politic idea that humans are violent, large groups of humans</p>
<p>become violent, they become irrational, specifically those two things, rivalrous and violent and</p>
<p>irrational.</p>
<p>And so in order to minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions,</p>
<p>they need ruled somehow.</p>
<p>And that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn&rsquo;t understand human</p>
<p>nature yet.</p>
<p>This gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing.</p>
<p>I think the idea of the masses is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the</p>
<p>classes that control to popularize the idea that most people are too violent, lazy, undisciplined</p>
<p>and irrational to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some</p>
<p>kind of way.</p>
<p>I think that if we look back at these conditioning environments, we can say, okay, so the kids</p>
<p>that go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter</p>
<p>Academy, there&rsquo;s still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric,</p>
<p>but on average, they become senators and the worst ones become high end lawyers or whatever.</p>
<p>And then I look at the inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see</p>
<p>a very, very differently displaced Gaussian distribution, but a very different set of</p>
<p>conditioning factors.</p>
<p>And then I say the masses, well, if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses</p>
<p>got to go to Exeter and have that family and whatever, would they still be the masses?</p>
<p>Could we actually condition more social virtue, more civic virtue, more orientation towards</p>
<p>dialectical synthesis, more empathy, more rationality widely?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Would that lead to better capacity for something like participatory governance, democracy or</p>
<p>republic or some kind of participatory governance?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it necessary for it actually?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And is it good for class interests?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>By the way, when you say class interests, this is the powerful leading over the less</p>
<p>powerful, that kind of idea.</p>
<p>Anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power doesn&rsquo;t necessarily benefit from decreasing</p>
<p>those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing the capacity of people more widely.</p>
<p>And so, when we talk about power, we&rsquo;re talking about asymmetries in agency, influence and</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>Do you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature?</p>
<p>I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff.</p>
<p>So like this pick up line that I use at a bar often, which is power corrupts and absolute</p>
<p>power corrupts, absolutely.</p>
<p>Is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say?</p>
<p>In modern society, there&rsquo;s something to be said, have we changed as societies over time</p>
<p>in terms of how much we crave power?</p>
<p>That there is an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned</p>
<p>one way or the other, yes, but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different</p>
<p>thing with it at scale, that you don&rsquo;t end up seeing the emergence of the same types</p>
<p>of sociopathic behavior and particularly then creating sociopathic institutions.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s like, is eating the foods that were rare in our evolutionary environment</p>
<p>that give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they&rsquo;re not anymore, salt,</p>
<p>sugar?</p>
<p>Is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation to overeat</p>
<p>if they can?</p>
<p>Well, the fact that there is that possibility doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone will obligately be obese</p>
<p>and die of obesity, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s possible to have a particular impulse and to be able to understand it, have other</p>
<p>ones and be able to balance them.</p>
<p>And so, to say that power dynamics are obligate in humans and we can&rsquo;t do anything about it</p>
<p>is very similar to me to saying like everyone is going to be obligately obese.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s some degree to which the control of those impulses has to do with the conditioning</p>
<p>early in life.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the culture that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, if we were to, bear with me, just asking for a friend, if we&rsquo;re to kill all humans</p>
<p>on Earth and then start over, is there ideas about how to build up, okay, we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to kill, let&rsquo;s leave the humans on Earth, they&rsquo;re fine and go to Mars and start a new</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>Is there ways to construct systems of conditioning, education of how we live with each other that</p>
<p>would incentivize us properly to not seek power, to not construct systems that are of</p>
<p>asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks,</p>
<p>to all kinds of destructions?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>Is there some inclination?</p>
<p>Of course, you probably don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but you have insights about what</p>
<p>that looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes</p>
<p>of various flavors until they&rsquo;re not assholes anymore because you become deeply empathetic</p>
<p>with their experience.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to this, like</p>
<p>what is the basis of rivalry?</p>
<p>How do you bind it?</p>
<p>How does it relate to tech?</p>
<p>If you have a culture that is doing less rivalry, does it always lose in war to those who do</p>
<p>war better?</p>
<p>And how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here?</p>
<p>Great, great.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s rivalry?</p>
<p>Well, is rivalry bad or good?</p>
<p>So is another word for rivalry competition?</p>
<p>Yes, I think roughly, yes.</p>
<p>I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here.</p>
<p>Good for some things, bad for other things.</p>
<p>Bad for some contexts and others.</p>
<p>Even that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example that relates back to the Facebook measuring thing you were mentioning</p>
<p>a moment ago.</p>
<p>First, I think what you&rsquo;re saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what</p>
<p>I want to get to in a moment, but it&rsquo;s not, the devil is in the details here.</p>
<p>So I enjoy praise, it feeds my ego, I grow stronger.</p>
<p>So I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to measure, there are problems with this argument, but there&rsquo;s also utility</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take it for the utility it has first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort.</p>
<p>We can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less, that</p>
<p>the bed is softer and, you know, material science and those types of things.</p>
<p>And happiness is actually hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain kinds of overcoming suffering that are necessary for happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s happiness that feels more like contentment and happiness that feels more like passion.</p>
<p>Is passion the source of all suffering or the source of all creativity?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s deep stuff and it&rsquo;s mostly first person, not measurable third person stuff,</p>
<p>even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree.</p>
<p>But we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments</p>
<p>who end up finding happiness, right, where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some Victor Frankl, Nelson Mandela, whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty easy to measure comfort and it&rsquo;s pretty universal.</p>
<p>And I think we can see that the Industrial Revolution started to replace happiness with</p>
<p>comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for.</p>
<p>And we can see that when increased comfort is given, maybe because of the evolutionary</p>
<p>disposition that expending extra calories when for the majority of our history we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have extra calories was not a safe thing to do.</p>
<p>Who knows why?</p>
<p>When extra comfort is given, it&rsquo;s very easy to take that path, even if it&rsquo;s not the path</p>
<p>that supports overall well being long term.</p>
<p>And so, we can see that, you know, when you look at the techno optimist idea that we have</p>
<p>better lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings and whatever, what they&rsquo;re largely looking</p>
<p>at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable the transportation systems are</p>
<p>and things like that, in which case there&rsquo;s massive improvement.</p>
<p>But we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort,</p>
<p>suicide and mental illness are the highest.</p>
<p>And we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually some of the ones that</p>
<p>are in materially lame environments.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s a very interesting question here, and if I understand correctly, you do</p>
<p>cold showers, and Joe Rogan was talking about how he needs to do some fairly intensive kind</p>
<p>of struggle that is a non comfort to actually induce being better as a person, this concept</p>
<p>of hormesis, that it&rsquo;s actually stressing an adaptive system that increases its adaptive</p>
<p>capacity, and that there&rsquo;s something that the happiness of a system has something to</p>
<p>do with its adaptive capacity, its overall resilience, health, well being, which requires</p>
<p>a decent bit of discomfort.</p>
<p>And yet, in the presence of the comfort solution, it&rsquo;s very hard to not choose it, and then</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re choosing it regularly, to actually down regulate your overall adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>And so, when we start saying, can we make tech where we&rsquo;re measuring for the things</p>
<p>that it produces beyond just the measure of GDP or whatever particular measures look like</p>
<p>the revenue generation or profit generation of my business, are all the meaningful things</p>
<p>measurable, and what are the right measures, and what are the externalities of optimizing</p>
<p>for that measurement set, what meaningful things aren&rsquo;t included in that measurement</p>
<p>set, that might have their own externalities, these are some of the questions we actually</p>
<p>have to take seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think they&rsquo;re answerable questions, right?</p>
<p>Progressively better, not perfect.</p>
<p>Right, so first of all, let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion, those seem</p>
<p>like useless, the distinction, because I said they&rsquo;re useful, well being is useful, but</p>
<p>I think I take it back.</p>
<p>I propose new metrics in this brainstorm session, which is, so one is like personal growth,</p>
<p>which is intellectual growth, I think we&rsquo;re able to make that concrete for ourselves,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a better person than you were a week ago, or a worse person than you were</p>
<p>a week ago.</p>
<p>I think we can ourselves report that, and understand what that means, it&rsquo;s this grey</p>
<p>area, and we try to define it, but I think we humans are pretty good at that, because</p>
<p>we have a sense, an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become.</p>
<p>We all dream of becoming a certain kind of person, and I think we have a sense of getting</p>
<p>closer and not towards that person.</p>
<p>Maybe this is not a great metric, fine.</p>
<p>The other one is love, actually.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re happy or not, or you&rsquo;re comfortable or not, how much love do you have towards</p>
<p>your fellow human beings?</p>
<p>I feel like if you try to optimize that, and increasing that, that&rsquo;s going to have, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good metric.</p>
<p>How many times a day, sorry, if I can quantify, how many times a day have you thought positively</p>
<p>of another human being?</p>
<p>Put that down as a number, and increase that number.</p>
<p>I think the process of saying, okay, so let&rsquo;s not take GDP or GDP per capita as the metric</p>
<p>we want to optimize for, because GDP goes up during war, and it goes up with more healthcare</p>
<p>spending from sicker people, and various things that we wouldn&rsquo;t say correlate to quality</p>
<p>of life.</p>
<p>Addiction drives GDP awesomely.</p>
<p>By the way, when I said growth, I wasn&rsquo;t referring to GDP.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving an example now of the primary metric we use, and why it&rsquo;s not an adequate metric,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re exploring other ones.</p>
<p>So the idea of saying, what would the metrics for a good civilization be?</p>
<p>If I had to pick a set of metrics, what would the best ones be if I was going to optimize</p>
<p>for those?</p>
<p>And then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply, and say, okay, so what happens</p>
<p>if we optimize for that?</p>
<p>Try to think through the first, and second, and third order effects of what happens that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positive, and then also say, what negative things can happen from optimizing that?</p>
<p>What actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining it?</p>
<p>Because love versus number of positive thoughts per day, I could just make a long list of</p>
<p>names and just say positive thing about each one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very superficial.</p>
<p>Not include animals or the rest of life, have a very shallow total amount of it, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>optimizing the number, and if I get some credit for the number.</p>
<p>And this is when I said the model of reality isn&rsquo;t reality.</p>
<p>When you make a set of metrics that we&rsquo;re going to optimize for this, whatever reality</p>
<p>is that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs, which is why</p>
<p>I would say that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices</p>
<p>beyond what metrics based optimization would offer.</p>
<p>Yeah, but another way to say that is wisdom is a constantly expanding and evolving set</p>
<p>of metrics.</p>
<p>Which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new metric that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t part of that metric set.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain kind of connection, discernment, awareness, and this is an iterative game theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a girdles and completeness theorem, right?</p>
<p>Which is if the system, if the set of things is consistent, it won&rsquo;t be complete.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to keep adding to it, which is why we were saying earlier, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not beautiful.</p>
<p>And especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at</p>
<p>the individual level is becoming, right?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re becoming more.</p>
<p>Well, that then becomes true for the civilization and our metric sets as well.</p>
<p>And our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a meaningful civilization.</p>
<p>I can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Well love is obviously not a metric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can bench.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good metric.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to optimize that across the entire population, starting with infants.</p>
<p>So in the same way that love isn&rsquo;t a metric, but you could make metrics that look at certain</p>
<p>parts of it.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m about to say isn&rsquo;t a metric, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a consideration because I</p>
<p>thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a metric, a right one.</p>
<p>I think that every metric by itself without this thing we talked about of the continuous</p>
<p>improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why what the idea of false idol means in terms of the model of reality</p>
<p>not being reality.</p>
<p>Then my sacred relationship is to reality itself, which also binds me to the unknown</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>To the known, but also to the unknown.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates an epistemic humility</p>
<p>that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing I know, but to learn new stuff.</p>
<p>And to be open to perceive reality directly.</p>
<p>So my model never becomes sacred.</p>
<p>My model is useful.</p>
<p>My</p>
<p>So the model can&rsquo;t be the false idol.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is why the first verse of the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not</p>
<p>the eternal Tao.</p>
<p>The naming then can become the source of the 10,000 things that if you get too carried</p>
<p>away with it can actually obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>It sounds a lot, a lot like Stephen Wolfram, but in a different language, much more poetic.</p>
<p>I can imagine that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m referring, I&rsquo;m joking, but there&rsquo;s a echoes of cellular automata, which you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>name.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t construct a good model cellular automata.</p>
<p>You can only watch in awe.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m distracting your train of thought horribly and miserably making it different.</p>
<p>By the way, something robots aren&rsquo;t good at and dealing with the uncertainty of uneven</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been okay so far.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been doing wonderfully.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your favorite metrics?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;re not a robot.</p>
<p>So I have a</p>
<p>So one metric, and there are problems with this, but one metric that I like to just as</p>
<p>a thought experiment to consider is because you&rsquo;re actually asking, I mean, I know you</p>
<p>ask your guests about the meaning of life because ultimately when you&rsquo;re saying what</p>
<p>is a desirable civilization, you can&rsquo;t answer that without answering what is a meaningful</p>
<p>human life and to say what is a good civilization because it&rsquo;s going to be in relationship to</p>
<p>that, right?</p>
<p>And then you have whatever your answer is, how do you know what is the epistemic basis</p>
<p>for postulating that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a whole nother reason for asking that question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t even apply to you whatsoever, which is, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>how few people have been asked questions like it.</p>
<p>The joke about these questions is silly, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to watch a person and if I was more of an asshole, I would really stick on</p>
<p>that question.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a silly question in some sense, but like we haven&rsquo;t really considered what it means.</p>
<p>Just a more concrete version of that question is what is a better world?</p>
<p>What is the kind of world we&rsquo;re trying to create really?</p>
<p>Have you really thought,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me, but let</p>
<p>me do the societal indices first because they&rsquo;re fun.</p>
<p>We should take a note of this meaningful thing because it&rsquo;s important to come back to.</p>
<p>Are you reminding me to ask you about the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Noted.</p>
<p>Let me jot that down.</p>
<p>So because I think I stopped tracking it like 25 open threads.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let it all burn.</p>
<p>One index that I find very interesting is the inverse correlation of addiction within</p>
<p>the society.</p>
<p>The more a society produces addiction within the people in it, the less healthy I think</p>
<p>the society is as a pretty fundamental metric.</p>
<p>And so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things in compelling</p>
<p>them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values.</p>
<p>And insofar as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it,</p>
<p>the inverse of addiction.</p>
<p>Lovely defined.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Addiction.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Compulsive behavior that is destructive towards things that we value.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very interesting one to think about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting one.</p>
<p>And this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close.</p>
<p>And the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed</p>
<p>to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and</p>
<p>needing that hypernormal stimuli, which does involve a kind of hormesis.</p>
<p>So I do think the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and</p>
<p>the ayahuasca journey and the Sundance were.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s even a big part of what yoga asana was, is to make beings that are resilient</p>
<p>and strong, they have to overcome some things.</p>
<p>To make beings that can control their own mind and fear, they have to face some fears.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want to put everybody in war or real trauma.</p>
<p>And yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know had childhoods of a lot of</p>
<p>trauma.</p>
<p>But some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma, whether</p>
<p>or not they happened to make it through and overcome that or not.</p>
<p>So how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever</p>
<p>that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people?</p>
<p>A certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves,</p>
<p>but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the</p>
<p>other people are there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff, but we have to also develop</p>
<p>resilience in the presence of that for the anti addiction direction and the fullness</p>
<p>of character and the trustworthiness to others.</p>
<p>So you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system, ritualize.</p>
<p>I mean, this sounds like you have to imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>
<p>You have to imagine Sisyphus with his rock, optimally resilient from a metrics perspective</p>
<p>in society.</p>
<p>So we want to constantly be throwing rocks at ourselves.</p>
<p>Not constantly.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to frequently, periodically, and there&rsquo;s different levels of intensity,</p>
<p>different periodicities.</p>
<p>Now, I do not think this should be imposed by states.</p>
<p>I think it should emerge from cultures.</p>
<p>And I think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of it.</p>
<p>So there is both a cultural cohesion to it, but there&rsquo;s also a voluntaryism because the</p>
<p>people value the thing that is being developed and understand it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what conditioning, it&rsquo;s conditioning some of these values.</p>
<p>Conditioning is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty, but when we recognize</p>
<p>the language that we speak and the words that we think in and the patterns of thought built</p>
<p>into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just</p>
<p>based on where we&rsquo;re born, you can&rsquo;t not condition people.</p>
<p>So all you can do is take more responsibility for what the conditioning factors are.</p>
<p>And then you have to think about this question of what is a meaningful human life?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re, unlike the other animals born into environment that they&rsquo;re genetically</p>
<p>adapted for, we&rsquo;re building new environments that we were not adapted for, and then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>becoming affected by those.</p>
<p>So then we have to say, well, what kinds of environments, digital environments, physical</p>
<p>environments, social environments would we want to create that would develop the healthiest,</p>
<p>happiest, most moral, noble, meaningful people?</p>
<p>What are even those sets of things that matter?</p>
<p>So you end up getting deep existential consideration at the heart of civilization design when you</p>
<p>start to realize how powerful we&rsquo;re becoming and how much what we&rsquo;re building it in service</p>
<p>towards matters.</p>
<p>Before I pull it, I think three threads you just laid down, is there another metric index</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more that I really like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a number, but the next one that comes to mind is I have to make a very quick model.</p>
<p>Healthy human bonding, say we were in a tribal type setting, my positive emotional states</p>
<p>and your positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated, your negative emotional</p>
<p>states and mine.</p>
<p>And so you start laughing, I start laughing, you start crying, my eyes might tear up.</p>
<p>And we would call that the compassion compersion axis.</p>
<p>I would, this is a model I find useful.</p>
<p>So compassion is when you&rsquo;re feeling something negative, I feel some pain, I feel some empathy,</p>
<p>something in relationship.</p>
<p>Compersion is when you do well, I&rsquo;m stoked for you, right?</p>
<p>Like I actually feel happiness at your happiness.</p>
<p>I like compersion.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fact that it&rsquo;s such an uncommon word in English is actually a problem culturally.</p>
<p>Because I feel that often, and I think that&rsquo;s a really good feeling to feel and maximize</p>
<p>for actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the metric I&rsquo;m going to say is the compassion compersion axis is the thing</p>
<p>I would optimize for.</p>
<p>Now, there is a state where my emotional states and your emotional states are just totally</p>
<p>decoupled.</p>
<p>And that is like sociopathy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, but I don&rsquo;t care if I do or for you to do well or whatever.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a worse state and it&rsquo;s extremely common, which is where they&rsquo;re inversely coupled.</p>
<p>Where my positive emotions correspond to your negative ones and vice versa.</p>
<p>And that is the, I would call it the jealousy sadism axis.</p>
<p>The jealousy axis is when you&rsquo;re doing really well, I feel something bad.</p>
<p>I feel taken away from, less than, upset, envious, whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so common, but I think of it as kind of a low grade psychopathology that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just normalized.</p>
<p>The idea that I&rsquo;m actually upset at the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like</p>
<p>a profoundly fucked up thing.</p>
<p>No, we shouldn&rsquo;t shame it and repress it so it gets worse.</p>
<p>We should study it.</p>
<p>Where does it come from?</p>
<p>And it comes from our own insecurities and stuff.</p>
<p>But then the next part that everybody knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same inverted, which is to the jealousy or the envy is the, I feel badly when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing well.</p>
<p>The sadism side is I actually feel good when you lose or when you&rsquo;re in pain, I feel some</p>
<p>happiness that&rsquo;s associated.</p>
<p>And you can see when someone feels jealous, sometimes they feel jealous with a partner</p>
<p>and then they feel they want that partner to get it, revenge comes up or something.</p>
<p>So sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path to sadism from the healthy compassion</p>
<p>conversion axis.</p>
<p>So, I would like to see a society that is inversely, that is conditioning sadism and</p>
<p>jealousy inversely, right?</p>
<p>The lower that amount and the more the compassion conversion.</p>
<p>And if I had to summarize that very simply, I&rsquo;d say it would optimize for conversion.</p>
<p>Which is because notice that&rsquo;s not just saying love for you where I might be self sacrificing</p>
<p>and miserable and I love people, but I kill myself, which I don&rsquo;t think anybody thinks</p>
<p>a great idea.</p>
<p>Happiness where I might be sociopathically happy where I&rsquo;m causing problems all over</p>
<p>the place or even sadistically happy, but it&rsquo;s a coupling, right?</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship where</p>
<p>I, my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually speaking of another pickup line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite honestly what I, as a guy who is single, this is going to come out very</p>
<p>ridiculous because it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, where&rsquo;s your girlfriend, bro?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I look for in a relationship because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so much, it&rsquo;s so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such an amazing life where you actually get joy from another person&rsquo;s success and</p>
<p>they get joy from your success.</p>
<p>And then it becomes like you don&rsquo;t actually need to succeed much for that to have a, like</p>
<p>a loop, like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>So like just be, just enjoying the happiness of others, the success of others.</p>
<p>So this, this is like the, let&rsquo;s call this, cause the first person that drilled this into</p>
<p>my head is Rogan, Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>He was the embodiment of that cause I saw somebody who is a successful, rich and nonstop</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>I mean, you could tell when somebody is full of shit and somebody is not really genuinely</p>
<p>enjoying the success of his friends.</p>
<p>That was weird to me.</p>
<p>That was interesting.</p>
<p>And I mean, the way you&rsquo;re kind of speaking to it, the reason Joe stood out to me is I</p>
<p>guess I haven&rsquo;t witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture of just real</p>
<p>joy for others.</p>
<p>I mean, part of that has to do, there hasn&rsquo;t been many channels where you can watch or</p>
<p>listen to people being their authentic selves.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who live life with compersion.</p>
<p>They probably don&rsquo;t seek public attention also, but that was, yeah, if there was any</p>
<p>word that could express what I&rsquo;ve learned from Joe, why he&rsquo;s been a really inspiring</p>
<p>figure is that compersion.</p>
<p>And I wish our world was, had a lot more of that cause then it may, I mean, my own, sorry</p>
<p>to go in a small tangent, but like you&rsquo;re speaking how society should function.</p>
<p>But I feel like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>live a truly fulfilling life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word to use, but that&rsquo;s a really good way to live life.</p>
<p>You will also learn what gets in the way of it and how to work with it that if you wanted</p>
<p>to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do</p>
<p>that, you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, as you mentioned that there&rsquo;s this virtuous cycle between when you</p>
<p>get stoked on other people doing well and then they have a similar relationship to you</p>
<p>and everyone is in the process of building each other up.</p>
<p>And this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy version.</p>
<p>The healthy version, right, the root, I believe it&rsquo;s a Latin word that means to strive together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that impulse of becoming where I want to become more, but I recognize that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a hormesis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But that means that, yes, there&rsquo;s an impulse where I&rsquo;m trying to get ahead.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m even trying to win, but I actually want a good opponent and I want them to get</p>
<p>ahead too because that is where my ongoing becoming happens and the win itself will get</p>
<p>boring very quickly.</p>
<p>The ongoing becoming is where there&rsquo;s aliveness and for the ongoing becoming, they need to</p>
<p>have it too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the strive together.</p>
<p>So, in the healthy competition, I&rsquo;m stoked when they&rsquo;re doing really well because my</p>
<p>becoming is supported by it.</p>
<p>Now this is actually a very nice segue into a model I like about what a meaningful human</p>
<p>life is, if you want to go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>I have three things I&rsquo;m going elsewhere with, but if we were first, let us take this short</p>
<p>stroll through the park of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Daniel, what is a meaningful life?</p>
<p>I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning</p>
<p>and the word purpose almost interchangeably and they&rsquo;ll think kind of, what is the meaning</p>
<p>of my life?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of human life?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of the universe?</p>
<p>And what is the meaning of existence rather than nonexistence?</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>cognitive mistakes that are very easy, like taking the idea of purpose.</p>
<p>Which is like a goal?</p>
<p>Which is a utilitarian concept.</p>
<p>The purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed value.</p>
<p>And to say, what is the purpose of everything?</p>
<p>Well, purpose is too small of a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamentally a relative question within everything.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of one thing relative to another?</p>
<p>What is the purpose of everything?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing outside of it with which to say it.</p>
<p>We actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless.</p>
<p>It means the concept is too small.</p>
<p>Which is why you end up getting to, you know, like in Taoism, talking about the nature of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Rather, there&rsquo;s a fundamental what where the why can&rsquo;t go deeper is the nature of it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to try to speak to a much simpler part, which is when people think about what</p>
<p>is a meaningful human life.</p>
<p>And kind of if we were to optimize for something at the level of individual life, but also,</p>
<p>how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual life lead to the best society</p>
<p>for insofar as people living that way affects others and long term, the world as a whole?</p>
<p>And how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about these things?</p>
<p>Because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there&rsquo;s value on two sides,</p>
<p>individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder</p>
<p>and whatever.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s failure modes on both sides.</p>
<p>And so, when you were starting to say, okay, individual happiness, you&rsquo;re like, wait, fuck,</p>
<p>sadists can be happy while hurting people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not individual happiness, it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>But wait, some people can self sacrifice out of love in a way that actually ends up just</p>
<p>creating codependency for everybody.</p>
<p>Or okay, so how do we think about all those things together?</p>
<p>This kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate to it is that a meaningful</p>
<p>life involves the mode of being, the mode of doing and the mode of becoming.</p>
<p>And it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes on</p>
<p>their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life.</p>
<p>The mode of being, the way I would describe it, if we&rsquo;re talking about the essence of</p>
<p>it is about taking in and appreciating the beauty of life that is now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being with what is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of experience.</p>
<p>The prima facie meaningfulness of when I&rsquo;m having this experience, I&rsquo;m not actually asking</p>
<p>what the meaning of life is, I&rsquo;m actually full of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m full of experiencing it.</p>
<p>The momentary experience, the moment.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So taking in the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Being is adding to the beauty of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to produce some art, I&rsquo;m going to produce some technology that will make life</p>
<p>easier and more beautiful for somebody else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do some science that will end up leading to better insights or other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand more about it or whatever</p>
<p>it is or protect it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to protect it in some way.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing.</p>
<p>And becoming is getting better at both of those.</p>
<p>Being able to deepen our being, which is to be able to take in the beauty of life more</p>
<p>profoundly, be more moved by it, touched by it, and increasing our capacity with doing</p>
<p>to add to the beauty of life more.</p>
<p>So I hold that a meaningful life has to be all three of those.</p>
<p>And where they&rsquo;re not in conflict with each other, ultimately it grounds in being, it</p>
<p>grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience.</p>
<p>And then my doing is ultimately something that will be able to increase the possibility</p>
<p>of the quality of experience for others.</p>
<p>And my becoming is a deepening on those.</p>
<p>So it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary possibility of experience.</p>
<p>And the point is to oscillate between these, never getting stuck on any one or I suppose</p>
<p>in parallel, well you can&rsquo;t really, attention is a thing, you can only allocate attention.</p>
<p>I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I&rsquo;m not thinking about what to</p>
<p>do next.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn&rsquo;t come from what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like how can I make life better for other people that don&rsquo;t have as much opportunities</p>
<p>I had?</p>
<p>How can I add something wonderful?</p>
<p>How can I just be in the creative process?</p>
<p>And so I think where the doing comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness</p>
<p>of being, it&rsquo;s inherently going to be paying attention to externalities or it&rsquo;s more oriented</p>
<p>to do that than if it comes from some emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that</p>
<p>is willing to cause sacrifices other places and where a chunk of its attention is internally</p>
<p>focused.</p>
<p>And so when Buddha said desire is the cause of all suffering, then later the vow of the</p>
<p>Bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient beings in universe forever is a pretty intense</p>
<p>thing like desire.</p>
<p>I would say there is a kind of desire, if we think of desire as a basis for movement</p>
<p>like a flow or a gradient, there&rsquo;s a kind of desire that comes from something missing</p>
<p>inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world.</p>
<p>That ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also not just non desire, there&rsquo;s a kind of desire that comes from feeling full</p>
<p>at the beauty of life and wanting to add to it that is a flow this direction.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that is the cause of suffering.</p>
<p>I think that is, you know, and the Western traditions, right, the Eastern traditions</p>
<p>focused on that and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them, in the moment outside</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>The Western tradition said, no, actually, desire is the source of creativity and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here to be made in the image and likeness of the creator.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to be fundamentally creative.</p>
<p>But creating from where and in service of what?</p>
<p>Creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness in service of the well being</p>
<p>of all of it is very different.</p>
<p>Which is back to that compassion, compersion axis.</p>
<p>Being, doing, becoming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>You could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying, where does death come</p>
<p>into that?</p>
<p>Being is forgetting, I mean, the concept of time completely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense to doing and becoming that has a deadline built in, the urgency built</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>Do you think death is fundamental to this, to a meaningful life?</p>
<p>Acknowledging or feeling the terror of death, like Ernest Becker, or just acknowledging</p>
<p>the uncertainty, the mystery, the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends.</p>
<p>Is that part of this equation or it&rsquo;s not necessary?</p>
<p>Okay, look at how it could be related.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced fear of death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also experienced times where I thought I was going to die that felt extremely peaceful</p>
<p>and beautiful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because we can be afraid of death because we&rsquo;re afraid of hell or bad</p>
<p>reincarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we&rsquo;re projecting</p>
<p>some kind of sentient suffering.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re afraid of just non experience, I noticed that every time I stay up late enough</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really tired, I&rsquo;m longing for deep sleep and non experience, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m actually longing for experience to stop.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not morbid, it&rsquo;s not a bummer.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind falling asleep and sometimes when I wake up, I want to go back into it</p>
<p>and then when it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;m happy to come out of it.</p>
<p>So when we think about death and having finite time here, and we could talk about if we live</p>
<p>for a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that, it would still be</p>
<p>finite time.</p>
<p>The one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start</p>
<p>to emotionally mature just shortly before they die.</p>
<p>But if I get to live forever, I can just stay focused on what&rsquo;s in it for me forever.</p>
<p>And if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and</p>
<p>adding to it and becoming continues, my life doesn&rsquo;t, but my life can have effects that</p>
<p>continue well beyond it, then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than</p>
<p>my life.</p>
<p>My life gets to be a part of and in service to.</p>
<p>And the whole thing about when old men plant trees, the shade of which they&rsquo;ll never get</p>
<p>to be in.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I read this poem by Hafez, the Sufi poet, written in like 13th</p>
<p>century or something like that, and he talked about that if you&rsquo;re lonely, to think about</p>
<p>him and he was kind of leaning his spirit into yours across the distance of a millennium</p>
<p>and would comfort you with these poems and just thinking about people a millennium from</p>
<p>now and caring about their experience and what they&rsquo;d be suffering if they&rsquo;d be lonely</p>
<p>and could he offer something that could touch them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just fucking beautiful.</p>
<p>And so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in it for me.</p>
<p>And death forces you to that.</p>
<p>So not only does death create the urgency of doing, you&rsquo;re very right, it does have</p>
<p>a sense in which it incentivizes the compersion and the compassion.</p>
<p>And the widening, you remember Einstein had that quote, something to the effect of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this one thing we call universe and something about us being inside of a prison</p>
<p>of perception that can only see a very narrow little bit of it.</p>
<p>But this might be just some weird disposition of mine, but when I think about the future</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;m dead and I think about consciousness, I think about young people falling in love</p>
<p>for the first time and their experience, and I think about people being awed by sunsets</p>
<p>and I think about all of it, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t not feel connected to that.</p>
<p>Do you feel some sadness to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely</p>
<p>by all of human history, you, Daniel, the name, that which cannot be named?</p>
<p>Systems like to self perpetuate, egos do that.</p>
<p>The idea that I might do something meaningful that future people will appreciate, of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a certain sweetness to that idea.</p>
<p>But I know how many people did something, did things that I wouldn&rsquo;t be here without</p>
<p>and that my life would be less without, whose names I will never know.</p>
<p>And I feel a gratitude to them, I feel a closeness, I feel touched by that, and I think to the</p>
<p>degree that the future people are conscious enough, there is a, you know, a lot of traditions</p>
<p>have this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond the names.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very healthy idea.</p>
<p>But let me return to a much less beautiful and a much less pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>You mentioned prison.</p>
<p>Back to X risk, okay.</p>
<p>And conditioning.</p>
<p>You mentioned something about the state.</p>
<p>So what role, let&rsquo;s talk about companies, governments, parents, all the mechanisms that</p>
<p>can be a source of conditioning.</p>
<p>Which flavor of ice cream do you like?</p>
<p>Do you think the state is the right thing for the future?</p>
<p>So governments that are elected democratic systems that are representing representative</p>
<p>democracy.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of political system of governance that you find appealing?</p>
<p>Is it parents, meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that&rsquo;s the most essential?</p>
<p>And then you and Michael Malice would happily agree that it&rsquo;s anarchy, or the state should</p>
<p>be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you&rsquo;re Michael Malice, giggling,</p>
<p>holding the torch as the fire burns.</p>
<p>So which which is it is the state can state be good?</p>
<p>Or is the state bad for the conditioning of a beautiful world, A or B?</p>
<p>This is like an SPT test.</p>
<p>You like to give these simplified good or bad things.</p>
<p>Would I like the state that we live in currently, the United States federal government to stop</p>
<p>existing today?</p>
<p>No, I would really not like that.</p>
<p>I think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Do I think that it&rsquo;s a optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those</p>
<p>things?</p>
<p>And I wanted to continue as is.</p>
<p>No, also not that.</p>
<p>But I am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a better thing without going</p>
<p>through the catastrophe phase that I think it&rsquo;s just non existence would give.</p>
<p>So what size of state is good in a sense like do we should we as a human society as this</p>
<p>world becomes more globalized?</p>
<p>Should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can put on a map like right</p>
<p>now, literally, like the the centers of power in the world, some of them are tech companies,</p>
<p>some of them are governments, should we be trying to as much as possible to decentralize</p>
<p>the power to where it&rsquo;s very difficult to point on the map, the centers of power.</p>
<p>And that means making the state however, there&rsquo;s a bunch of different ways to make the government</p>
<p>much smaller, that could be reducing in the United States, reducing the funding for the</p>
<p>government, all those kinds of things, their set of responsibilities, the set of powers,</p>
<p>it could be, I mean, this is far out, but making more nations, or maybe nations not</p>
<p>in the space that are defined by geographic location, but rather in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>which is what anarchy is about.</p>
<p>So anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas, and doing so dynamically</p>
<p>not based on where you were born, and so on.</p>
<p>I think we can say that the natural state of humans, if we want to describe such a thing,</p>
<p>is to live in tribes that were below the Dunbar number, meaning that for a few hundred thousand</p>
<p>years of human history, all of the groups of humans mostly stayed under that size.</p>
<p>And whenever it would get up to that size, it would end up cleaving.</p>
<p>And so it seems like there&rsquo;s a pretty strong, but there weren&rsquo;t individual humans out in</p>
<p>the wild doing really well, right?</p>
<p>So we were a group animal, but with groups that had a specific size.</p>
<p>So we could say, in a way, humans were being domesticated by those groups.</p>
<p>They were learning how to have certain rules to participate with the group, without which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get kicked out.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s still the wild state of people.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s useful to do as a side statement, which I&rsquo;ve recently looked at a bunch of</p>
<p>papers around Dunbar&rsquo;s number, where the mean is actually 150.</p>
<p>If you actually look at the original papers, it&rsquo;s a range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a range.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually somewhere under a thousand.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a range of like two to 500 or whatever it is.</p>
<p>But like you could argue that the, I think it actually is exactly two, the range is two</p>
<p>to 520, something like that.</p>
<p>And this is the mean that&rsquo;s taken crudely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very good paper in terms of the actual numerically speaking.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;d be interesting if there&rsquo;s a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for</p>
<p>particular environments, particular conditions, so on.</p>
<p>It is very true that they&rsquo;re likely to be something small, you know, under a million.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;d be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will change</p>
<p>the fabric of this conversation.</p>
<p>I just want to kind of throw that in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the 150 is baked in somehow into the hardware.</p>
<p>We can talk about some of the things that it probably has to do with.</p>
<p>Up to a certain number of people.</p>
<p>And this is going to be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to</p>
<p>some degree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in a minute.</p>
<p>Up to a certain number of people, everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go ahead and just take 150 as an average number.</p>
<p>Everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your extended family and you&rsquo;re stuck living with them and you know who they are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no anonymous people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no just them and over there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one part of what leads to a kind of tribal process where it&rsquo;s good for the</p>
<p>individual and good for the whole has a coupling.</p>
<p>Also below that scale, everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not groups that are very siloed.</p>
<p>And as a result, it&rsquo;s actually very hard to get away with bad behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a force kind of transparency.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t need kind of like the state in that way.</p>
<p>But lying to people doesn&rsquo;t actually get you ahead.</p>
<p>Sociopathic behavior doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead because it gets seen.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a conditioning environment where the individual is behaving in a way</p>
<p>that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned.</p>
<p>When it gets to be a much larger system, it becomes easier to hide certain things from</p>
<p>the group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people.</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people, we</p>
<p>could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really</p>
<p>big decision.</p>
<p>Do we migrate?</p>
<p>Do we not migrate?</p>
<p>Do we, you know, something like that?</p>
<p>Do we get rid of this person?</p>
<p>And why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>part of that council?</p>
<p>And so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part of</p>
<p>a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I&rsquo;m subject to.</p>
<p>So I think the cleaving and a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can</p>
<p>look at that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>And if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy, that civilization will last.</p>
<p>And so there are things that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society,</p>
<p>things we can do to increase the binding energy.</p>
<p>I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size kind</p>
<p>of tribalism.</p>
<p>That ended with a few things.</p>
<p>It ended with people having migrated enough that when you started to get resource wars,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t just migrate away easily.</p>
<p>And so tribal warfare became more obligated.</p>
<p>It involved the plow and the beginning of real economic surplus.</p>
<p>So there were a few different kind of forcing functions.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about what size should it be, right?</p>
<p>What size should a society be?</p>
<p>And I think the idea, like if we think about your body for a moment as a self organizing</p>
<p>complex system that is multi scaled, we think about&hellip;</p>
<p>Our body is a wonderland.</p>
<p>Our body is a wonderland, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a John Mayer song.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>But yes, so if we think about our body and the billions of cells that are in it.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t have&hellip;</p>
<p>Think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells</p>
<p>in it with no internal organization structure, right?</p>
<p>Just like a sea of protoplasm.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Pure democracy.</p>
<p>And so you have cells and tissues, and then you have tissues and organs and organs and</p>
<p>organ systems, and so you have these layers of organization, and then obviously the individual</p>
<p>in a tribe in a ecosystem.</p>
<p>And each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers, but also influencing</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>I think the future of civilization will be similar, which is there&rsquo;s a level of governance</p>
<p>that happens at the level of the individual.</p>
<p>My own governance of my own choice.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a level that happens at the level of a family.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making decisions together, we&rsquo;re inter influencing each other and affecting each</p>
<p>other, taking responsibility for the idea of an extended family.</p>
<p>And you can see that like for a lot of human history, we had an extended family, we had</p>
<p>a local community, a local church or whatever it was, we had these intermediate structures.</p>
<p>Whereas right now, there&rsquo;s kind of like the individual producer, consumer, taxpayer, voter,</p>
<p>and the massive nation state global complex, and not that much in the way of intermediate</p>
<p>structures that we relate with, and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics,</p>
<p>all impersonalized, made fungible.</p>
<p>And so, I think that we have to have global governance, meaning I think we have to have</p>
<p>governance at the scale we affect stuff, and if anybody is messing up the oceans, that</p>
<p>matters for everybody.</p>
<p>So, that can&rsquo;t only be national or only local.</p>
<p>Everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top down system</p>
<p>of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared of that same version, so I&rsquo;m not talking about that kind of global governance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m even using the word governance as a process rather than government as an</p>
<p>imposed phenomena.</p>
<p>And so, I think we have to have global governance, but I think we also have to have local governance,</p>
<p>and there has to be relationships between them that each, where there are both checks</p>
<p>and balances and power flows of information.</p>
<p>So, I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than governance</p>
<p>at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things</p>
<p>that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that.</p>
<p>I think cities are based on real things that will keep being real where the proximity of</p>
<p>certain things together, the physical proximity of things together gives increased value of</p>
<p>those things.</p>
<p>So, you look at like Jeffrey West&rsquo;s work on scale and finding that companies and nation</p>
<p>states and things that have a kind of complicated agreement structure get diminishing return</p>
<p>of, of production per capita as the total number of people increases beyond about the</p>
<p>tribal scale.</p>
<p>But the city actually gets increasing productivity per capita, but it&rsquo;s not designed, it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of this organic thing, right?</p>
<p>So, there should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually</p>
<p>have some agency there, probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals</p>
<p>and some of it won&rsquo;t be geographic, it&rsquo;ll be network based, right?</p>
<p>Networks of affinities.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think the future is one type of governance.</p>
<p>Now, what we can say more broadly is say, when we&rsquo;re talking about groups of people</p>
<p>that inner affect each other, the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out how</p>
<p>to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase</p>
<p>total productive capacity in a way that&rsquo;s good for everybody, division of labor and</p>
<p>specialty so we all get more better stuff and whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a coordination of our choice making.</p>
<p>I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination</p>
<p>of choice making, so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal</p>
<p>war comes about or whatever, or they can&rsquo;t make smart decisions and they overuse their</p>
<p>resources or whatever.</p>
<p>Or it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition, via force, and so it</p>
<p>fails on the side of oppression, which ends up being for a while functionalish for the</p>
<p>thing as a whole, but miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt</p>
<p>or because it can&rsquo;t innovate enough or something like that.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s this like toggling between order via oppression and chaos.</p>
<p>And I think the idea of democracy, not the way we&rsquo;ve implemented it, but the idea of</p>
<p>it, whether we&rsquo;re talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital democracy, liquid</p>
<p>democracy, a republic or whatever, the idea of an open society, participatory governance</p>
<p>is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren&rsquo;t stuck with</p>
<p>chaos and infighting and inability to coordinate, and we&rsquo;re also not stuck with oppression?</p>
<p>And what would it take to have emergent order?</p>
<p>This is the most kind of central question for me these days because if we look at what</p>
<p>different nation states are doing around the world and we see nation states that are more</p>
<p>authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating much more effectively.</p>
<p>So for instance, we can see that China has built high speed rail not just through its</p>
<p>country but around the world and the US hasn&rsquo;t built any high speed rail yet.</p>
<p>You can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we&rsquo;ve had increasing</p>
<p>economic inequality happening.</p>
<p>You can see like that if there was a single country that could make all of its own stuff</p>
<p>if the global supply chains failed, China would be the closest one to being able to</p>
<p>start to go closed loop on fundamental things.</p>
<p>Belt and Road Initiative, supply chain on rare earth metals, transistor manufacturing</p>
<p>that is like, oh, they&rsquo;re actually coordinating more effectively in some important ways.</p>
<p>In the last call it 30 years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s imposed order.</p>
<p>Imposed order.</p>
<p>And we can see that if in the US, let&rsquo;s look at why real quick.</p>
<p>We know why we created term limits so that we wouldn&rsquo;t have forever monarchs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances</p>
<p>on power and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But that also has created a negative second order effect, which is nobody does long term</p>
<p>planning because somebody comes in who&rsquo;s got four years, they want reelected.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do anything that doesn&rsquo;t create a return within four years that will end up</p>
<p>getting them elected, reelected.</p>
<p>And so the 30 year industrial development to build high speed trains or the new kind</p>
<p>of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn&rsquo;t get invested in.</p>
<p>And then if you have left versus right, where whatever someone does for four years, then</p>
<p>the other guy gets in and undoes it for four years.</p>
<p>And most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other.</p>
<p>This system is just dissipating as heat, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just burning up as heat.</p>
<p>And the system that has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they</p>
<p>got rid of those people can actually coordinate better.</p>
<p>But I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic properties that are</p>
<p>not the thing we want.</p>
<p>So the goal is to accomplish, to create a system that does long term planning without</p>
<p>the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the long term and accomplish</p>
<p>that through not doing the imposition of a single leader, but through emergence.</p>
<p>So that perhaps, first of all, the technology in itself seems to maybe disagree a lot for</p>
<p>different possibilities here, which is make primary the system, not the humans.</p>
<p>So the basic, the medium on which the democracy happens, like a platform where people can</p>
<p>make decisions, do the choice making, the coordination of the choice making, where emerges</p>
<p>some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family, the</p>
<p>family, the city, the country, the continent, the whole world, and then does that so dynamically,</p>
<p>constantly changing based on the needs of the people, sort of always evolving.</p>
<p>And it would all be owned by Google.</p>
<p>Is there a way to, so first of all, you&rsquo;re optimistic that you could basically create</p>
<p>the technology can save us technology at creating platforms by technology, I mean, like software</p>
<p>network platforms that allows humans to deliberate, like make government together dynamically</p>
<p>without the need for a leader that&rsquo;s on a podium screaming stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one and two.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re optimistic about that, are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms?</p>
<p>The idea that technology is values neutral, values agnostic, and people can use it for</p>
<p>constructive or destructive purposes, but it doesn&rsquo;t predispose anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just silly and naive.</p>
<p>Technology elicits patterns of human behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead</p>
<p>end up behaving differently because of their utilization of it, and then other people,</p>
<p>then they end up shaping the world or other people race to also get the power of the technology</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s whole schools of anthropology that look at the effect on social systems</p>
<p>and the minds of people of the change in our tooling.</p>
<p>Marvin Harris&rsquo;s work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply, obviously Marshall</p>
<p>McLuhan looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature</p>
<p>of our beliefs, minds, values, social systems.</p>
<p>I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will disagree on the subtle</p>
<p>details but I&rsquo;ll do it kind of like illustratively.</p>
<p>You think about the emergence of the plow, the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture</p>
<p>that came with it where before that you had hunter gatherer and then you had horticulture</p>
<p>kind of a digging stick but not the plow.</p>
<p>Well the world changed a lot with that, right?</p>
<p>And a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn</p>
<p>plow started to proliferate, any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually</p>
<p>cultivate grain because just with a digging stick you couldn&rsquo;t get enough grain for it</p>
<p>to matter, grain was a storable caloric surplus, they could make it through the famines, they</p>
<p>could grow their population, so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate</p>
<p>and everybody used it, that corresponding with the use of a plow, animism went away</p>
<p>everywhere that it existed because you can&rsquo;t talk about the spirit of the buffalo while</p>
<p>beating the cow all day long to pull the plow, so the moment that we do animal husbandry</p>
<p>of that kind where you have to beat the cow all day, you have to say it&rsquo;s just a dumb</p>
<p>animal, man has dominion over earth and the nature of even our religious and spiritual</p>
<p>ideas change.</p>
<p>You went from women primarily using the digging stick to do the horticulture or gathering</p>
<p>before that, men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the plow because the upper</p>
<p>body strength actually really mattered, women would have miscarriages when they would do</p>
<p>it when they were pregnant, so all the caloric supply started to come from men where it had</p>
<p>been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods</p>
<p>following that.</p>
<p>Obviously we went from very, that particular line of thought then also says that feminism</p>
<p>followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the West started to follow women</p>
<p>being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn&rsquo;t differential</p>
<p>once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea, so I think this</p>
<p>is a reductionist view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values</p>
<p>agnostic is silly.</p>
<p>Technology codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior</p>
<p>and believing in them.</p>
<p>The plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene, right, it was the beginning of us changing</p>
<p>the environment radically to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which</p>
<p>also meant the change of the view of where the web of life were just a part of it, etc.</p>
<p>So all those types of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliantly put, by the way, that was just brilliant.</p>
<p>But the question is, so it&rsquo;s not agnostic, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So we have to look at what the psychological effects of specific tech applied certain ways</p>
<p>are and be able to say it&rsquo;s not just doing the first order thing you intended, it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal culture in the beginning</p>
<p>of empire and the class systems that came with that.</p>
<p>We can go on and on about what the plow did.</p>
<p>The beginning of surplus was inheritance, which then became the capital model and like</p>
<p>lots of things.</p>
<p>So we have to say when we&rsquo;re looking at the tech, what are the values built into the way</p>
<p>the tech is being built that are not obvious?</p>
<p>Right, so you always have to consider externalities.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the externalities are not just physical to the environment, they&rsquo;re also to how the</p>
<p>people are being conditioned and how the relationality between them is being conditioned.</p>
<p>So the question I&rsquo;m asking you, so I personally would rather be led by a plow and a tractor</p>
<p>than Stalin, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;m asking you.</p>
<p>In creating an emergent government where people, where there&rsquo;s a democracy that&rsquo;s dynamic,</p>
<p>that makes choices, that does governance at like a very kind of liquid, there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales, right?</p>
<p>And doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate</p>
<p>and impose rule, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Stalin version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying isn&rsquo;t the alternative that&rsquo;s emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and</p>
<p>the tractor, which is the modern version of that, is like the internet, the digital space</p>
<p>where we can, the monetary system where you have the currency and so on, but you have</p>
<p>much more importantly, to me at least, is just basic social interaction, the mechanisms</p>
<p>of human transacting with each other in the space of ideas, isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s not agnostic, definitely not agnostic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a brilliant rant there.</p>
<p>The tractor has effects, but isn&rsquo;t that the way we achieve an emergent system of governance?</p>
<p>Yes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re on track.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t seen anything promising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t seen anything promising, it&rsquo;s that to be on track requires understanding</p>
<p>and guiding some of the things differently than is currently happening and it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what I really care about.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t have had a Stalin without having certain technologies emerge.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t have ruled such a big area without transportation technologies, without the train,</p>
<p>without the communication tech that made it possible.</p>
<p>So when you say you&rsquo;d rather have a tractor or a plow than a Stalin, there&rsquo;s a relationship</p>
<p>between them that is more recursive, which is new physical technologies allow rulers</p>
<p>to rule with more power over larger distances historically.</p>
<p>And some things are more responsible for that than others.</p>
<p>Like Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast, but the thing he ate for breakfast is less</p>
<p>responsible for the starvation of millions than the train.</p>
<p>The train is more responsible for that and then the weapons of war are more responsible.</p>
<p>So some technology, let&rsquo;s not throw it all in the, you&rsquo;re saying like technology has</p>
<p>a responsibility here, but some is better than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that people&rsquo;s use of technology will change their behavior.</p>
<p>So it has behavioral dispositions built in.</p>
<p>The change of the behavior will also change the values in the society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complicated, right?</p>
<p>It will also, as a result, both make people who have different kinds of predispositions</p>
<p>with regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities.</p>
<p>And so we have to think about these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism ended</p>
<p>feudalism and created kind of nation states.</p>
<p>So one thing I would say as a long trend that we can look at is that whenever there is a</p>
<p>step function, a major leap in technology, physical technology, the underlying techno</p>
<p>industrial base with which we do stuff, it ends up coding for, it ends up predisposing</p>
<p>a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social system had not emerged</p>
<p>to try to solve.</p>
<p>And so it usually ends up breaking the previous social systems, the way the plow broke the</p>
<p>tribal system, the way that the industrial revolution broke the feudal system, and then</p>
<p>new social systems have to emerge so they can deal with the new powers, the new dispositions,</p>
<p>whatever with that tech.</p>
<p>Obviously, the nuke broke nation state governance being adequate and said, we can&rsquo;t ever have</p>
<p>that again.</p>
<p>So then it created this international governance apparatus world.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following the current</p>
<p>path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do, market being a previous social</p>
<p>tech.</p>
<p>I would say that exponential tech, if we look at different types of social tech, so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing, right?</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the story, and which is, and this is why if you look, this important part</p>
<p>to build first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just doing it poorly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, I mean, that&rsquo;s, it is emergent order in some sense.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the hope of democracy versus other forms of government.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I mean, I said at least the story because obviously it didn&rsquo;t do it for women and slaves</p>
<p>early on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do it for all classes equally, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the idea of democracy is that, is participatory governance.</p>
<p>And so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the European enlightenment</p>
<p>and specifically because the idea that a lot of people, some huge number, not a tribal</p>
<p>number, a huge number of anonymous people who don&rsquo;t know each other, are not bonded</p>
<p>to each other, who believe different things, who grew up in different ways, can all work</p>
<p>together to make collective decisions, well, that affect everybody, and where some of them</p>
<p>will make compromises and the thing that matters to them for what matters to other strangers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually wild.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a wild idea that that would even be possible.</p>
<p>And it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we could all do the</p>
<p>philosophy of science and we could all do the Hegelian dialectic.</p>
<p>Those ideas had emerged, right?</p>
<p>And it was that we could all, so our choice making, because we said a society is trying</p>
<p>to coordinate choice making, the emergent order is the order of the choices that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making, not just at the level of the individuals, but what groups of individuals, corporations,</p>
<p>nations, states, whatever do.</p>
<p>Our choices are based on, our choice making is based on our sense making and our meaning</p>
<p>making.</p>
<p>Our sense making is what do we believe is happening in the world, and what do we believe</p>
<p>the effects of a particular thing would be.</p>
<p>Our meaning making is what do we care about, right, our values generation, what do we care</p>
<p>about that we&rsquo;re trying to move the world in the direction of.</p>
<p>If you ultimately are trying to move the world in a direction that is really, really different</p>
<p>than the direction I&rsquo;m trying to, we have very different values, we&rsquo;re gonna have a</p>
<p>hard time.</p>
<p>And if you think the world is a very different world, right, if you think that systemic racism</p>
<p>is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems, and I think it&rsquo;s not even a thing,</p>
<p>if you think climate change is almost existential, and I think it&rsquo;s not even a thing, we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have a really hard time coordinating.</p>
<p>And so, we have to be able to have shared sense making of can we come to understand</p>
<p>just what is happening together, and then can we do shared values generation, okay?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m emphasizing a particular value more than you, but I can take your perspective</p>
<p>and I can see how the thing that you value is worth valuing, and I can see how it&rsquo;s affected</p>
<p>by this thing.</p>
<p>So, can we take all the values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all</p>
<p>of them better than the proposition I created just to benefit these ones that harms the</p>
<p>ones that you care about, which is why you&rsquo;re opposing my proposition?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently to see, and this is</p>
<p>the reason that the proposition we vote on, it gets half the votes almost all the time.</p>
<p>It almost never gets 90% of the votes, is because it benefits some things and harms</p>
<p>other things.</p>
<p>We can say all theory of trade offs, but we didn&rsquo;t even try to say, could we see what</p>
<p>everybody cares about and see if there is a better solution?</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>How do we fix that try?</p>
<p>I wonder, is it as simple as the social technology of education?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I mean, the proposition crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or participatory</p>
<p>governance, and it&rsquo;s not currently.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the humans creating that situation?</p>
<p>So one way, there&rsquo;s two ways to fix that.</p>
<p>One is to fix the individual humans, which is the education early in life, and the second</p>
<p>is to create somehow systems that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>So I understand the education part, but creating systems, that&rsquo;s why I mentioned the technologies</p>
<p>is creating social networks, essentially.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s actually necessary.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go to the first part and then we&rsquo;ll come to the second part.</p>
<p>So democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we could all do a dialectic and</p>
<p>come to understand what other people valued, and so that we could actually come up with</p>
<p>a cooperative solution rather than just, fuck you, we&rsquo;re gonna get our thing in war, right?</p>
<p>And that we could sense make together.</p>
<p>We could all apply the philosophy of science and you weren&rsquo;t gonna stick to your guns on</p>
<p>what the speed of sound is if we measured it and we found out what it was, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a unifying element to the objectivity in that way.</p>
<p>And so this is why I believe Jefferson said, if you could give me a perfect newspaper and</p>
<p>a broken government, or in paraphrasing, a broken government and perfect newspaper, I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take the perfect newspaper.</p>
<p>Because if the people understand what&rsquo;s going on, they can build a new government.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on, they can&rsquo;t possibly make good choices.</p>
<p>And Washington, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing again, first president said the number one aim of the federal</p>
<p>government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen and the science of government.</p>
<p>Science of government was the term of art.</p>
<p>Think about what that means, right?</p>
<p>Science of government would be game theory, coordination theory, history, wouldn&rsquo;t call</p>
<p>game theory yet, history, sociology, economics, right?</p>
<p>All the things that lead to how we understand human coordination.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so profound that he didn&rsquo;t say the number one aim of the federal government</p>
<p>is rule of law.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s protecting the border from enemies.</p>
<p>Because if the number one aim was to protect the border from enemies, it could do that</p>
<p>as a military dictatorship quite effectively.</p>
<p>And if the goal was rule of law, it could do it as a dictatorship, as a police state.</p>
<p>And so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of</p>
<p>all the citizens and the science of government, it won&rsquo;t stay democracy long.</p>
<p>You can see, so both education and the fourth estate, the fourth estate being the&hellip;</p>
<p>So education, can I make sense of the world?</p>
<p>Am I trained to make sense of the world?</p>
<p>The fourth estate is what&rsquo;s actually going on currently, the news.</p>
<p>Do I have good, unbiased information about it?</p>
<p>Those are both considered prerequisite institutions for democracy to even be a possibility.</p>
<p>And then at the scale it was initially suggested here, the town hall was the key phenomena</p>
<p>where there wasn&rsquo;t a special interest group crafted a proposition, and the first thing</p>
<p>I ever saw was the proposition, didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, and I got to vote yes or</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>It was in the town hall, we all got to talk about it, and the proposition could get crafted</p>
<p>in real time through the conversation, which is why there was that founding fathers statement</p>
<p>that voting is the death of democracy.</p>
<p>Voting fundamentally is polarizing the population in some kind of sublimated war.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll do that as the last step, but what we wanna do first is to say, how does the</p>
<p>thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition, how could that turn into</p>
<p>a solution to make this proposition better?</p>
<p>Where this proposition still tends to the thing it&rsquo;s trying to tend to and tends to</p>
<p>that better.</p>
<p>Can we work on this together?</p>
<p>And in a town hall, we could have that.</p>
<p>As the scale increased, we lost the ability to do that.</p>
<p>Now, as you mentioned, the internet could change that.</p>
<p>The fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to</p>
<p>the other one to see what the colony would do, that we stopped having this kind of developmental</p>
<p>propositional development process when the town hall ended.</p>
<p>The fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane</p>
<p>and aligned with class interests.</p>
<p>I would push back to say that the internet has those things, it just has a lot of other</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>I feel like the internet has places where that encourage synthesis of competing ideas</p>
<p>and sense making, which is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing</p>
<p>it under current incentives, perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Linux is awesome, right?</p>
<p>And Wikipedia and places where you have, and they have problems, but places where you have</p>
<p>open source sharing of information, vetting of information towards collective building.</p>
<p>Is that building something like, how much has that affected our court systems or our</p>
<p>policing systems or our military systems or our?</p>
<p>First of all, I think a lot, but not enough.</p>
<p>I think this is something I told you offline yesterday as a, perhaps as a whole nother</p>
<p>discussion, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re quite quantifying the impact on the world, the positive</p>
<p>impact of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You said the policing, I mean, I just, I just think the amount of empathy that like knowledge</p>
<p>I think can&rsquo;t help, but lead to empathy, just knowing, okay.</p>
<p>Just knowing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some pieces of information, knowing how many people died in various wars</p>
<p>that already that Delta, when you have millions of people have that knowledge, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little like slap in the face, like, Oh, like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking</p>
<p>up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people were tortured, you know, like just</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>And when a lot of people know that because of Wikipedia, uh, or the effect, their second</p>
<p>order effects of Wikipedia, which is it&rsquo;s not that necessarily people read Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like YouTubers who don&rsquo;t really know stuff that well will thoroughly read a Wikipedia</p>
<p>article and create a compelling video describing that Wikipedia article that then millions</p>
<p>of people watch and they understand that.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>A lot of, there was such, first of all, there was such a thing as world war II and world</p>
<p>war I.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like they can at least like learn about it.</p>
<p>They can learn about this was like recent.</p>
<p>They can learn about slavery.</p>
<p>They can learn about all kinds of injustices in the world.</p>
<p>And that I think has a lot of effects to our, to the way, whether you&rsquo;re a police officer,</p>
<p>a lawyer, a judge in the jury, or just the regular civilian citizen, the way you approach</p>
<p>the every other communication you engage in, even if the system of that communication is</p>
<p>very much flawed.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a huge positive effect on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my case for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So you should donate to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a huge fan, but there&rsquo;s very few systems like it, which is sad to me.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, it would be a useful exercise for any, uh, listener of the show to really</p>
<p>try to run the dialectical synthesis process with regard to a topic like this and take</p>
<p>the, um, techno concerned perspective with regard to, uh, information tech that folks</p>
<p>like Tristan Harris take and say, what are all of the things that are getting worse and</p>
<p>what, and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much worse, how quickly could</p>
<p>that be?</p>
<p>And then, and do that fully without mitigating it, then take the techno optimist perspective</p>
<p>and see what things are getting better in a way that Kurzweil or Diamandis or someone</p>
<p>might do and try to take that perspective fully and say, are some of those things exponential?</p>
<p>What could that portend?</p>
<p>And then try to hold all that at the same time.</p>
<p>And I think there are ways in which, depending upon the metrics we&rsquo;re looking at, things</p>
<p>are getting worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different</p>
<p>metrics at the same time, which I hold as the destabilization of previous system and</p>
<p>either an emergence to a better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible.</p>
<p>And so I want my optimism not to be about my assessment.</p>
<p>I want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be.</p>
<p>I want my optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment.</p>
<p>So I never want to apply optimism in the sense making.</p>
<p>I want to just try to be clear.</p>
<p>If anything, I want to make sure that the challenges are really well understood.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s in service of an optimism that there are good potentials, even if I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they are, that are worth seeking.</p>
<p>There is some sense of optimism that&rsquo;s required to even try to innovate really hard problems.</p>
<p>But then I want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see, is that solution</p>
<p>not going to work?</p>
<p>Does it have second order effects?</p>
<p>And then not get upset by that because I then come back to how to make it better.</p>
<p>So just a relationship between optimism and pessimism and the dialectic of how they can</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>So when I, of course, we can say that Wikipedia is a pretty awesome example of a thing.</p>
<p>We can look at the places where it has limits or has failed, where on a celebrity topic</p>
<p>or corporate interest topic, you can pay Wikipedia editors to edit more frequently and various</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>But you can also see where there&rsquo;s a lot of information that was kind of decentrally created</p>
<p>that is good information that is more easily accessible to people than everybody buying</p>
<p>their own encyclopedia Britannica or walking down to the library and that can be updated</p>
<p>in real time faster.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re very right that the business model is a big difference because Wikipedia</p>
<p>is not a for profit corporation.</p>
<p>It is a ‚Äì it&rsquo;s tending to the information commons and it doesn&rsquo;t have an agenda other</p>
<p>than tending to the information commons.</p>
<p>And I think the two masters issue is a tricky one when I&rsquo;m trying to optimize for very different</p>
<p>kinds of things where I have to sacrifice one for the other and I can&rsquo;t find synergistic</p>
<p>satisfiers.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>And if I have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder profit maximization and, you know,</p>
<p>what does that end up creating?</p>
<p>I think the ad model that Silicon Valley took, I think Jaron Laney or I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had him on the show, but he has an interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but also</p>
<p>the belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more</p>
<p>people you got on, you got increased value per user, per capita as more people got on</p>
<p>so you didn&rsquo;t want to do anything to slow the rate of adoption.</p>
<p>Some places actually, you know, PayPal paying people money to join the network because the</p>
<p>value of the network would be, there&rsquo;d be a Metcalf like dynamic proportional to the</p>
<p>square of the total number of users.</p>
<p>So the ad model made sense of how do we make it free but also be a business, get everybody</p>
<p>on but not really thinking about what it would mean to ‚Äì and this is now the whole idea</p>
<p>that if you aren&rsquo;t paying for the product, you are the product.</p>
<p>If they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder to maximize profit, their</p>
<p>customer is the advertiser, the user who it&rsquo;s being built for is to do behavioral mod for</p>
<p>them for advertisers, that&rsquo;s a whole different thing than that same type of tech could have</p>
<p>been if applied with a different business model or different purpose.</p>
<p>I think because Facebook and Google and other information and communication platforms end</p>
<p>up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are in</p>
<p>a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than</p>
<p>even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting,</p>
<p>they basically are accessing privileged information.</p>
<p>There should be a fiduciary responsibility.</p>
<p>And in normal fiduciary law, if there&rsquo;s this principal agent thing, if you are a principal</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m an agent on your behalf, I don&rsquo;t have a game theoretic relationship with you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sharing something with me and I&rsquo;m the priest or I&rsquo;m the therapist, I&rsquo;m never</p>
<p>going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>But Facebook is gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to</p>
<p>modify people&rsquo;s behavior for a behavior that they didn&rsquo;t sign up for wanting the behavior</p>
<p>but what the corporation did.</p>
<p>So I think this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous</p>
<p>social tech where it&rsquo;s being shaped in particular ways.</p>
<p>And here, unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the information commons, this evolved for</p>
<p>fulfilling particular agentic purpose.</p>
<p>Most people when they&rsquo;re on Facebook think it&rsquo;s just a tool that they&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s an agent, right?</p>
<p>It is a corporation with a profit motive and as I&rsquo;m interacting with it, it has a goal</p>
<p>for me different than my goal for myself.</p>
<p>And I might want to be on for a short period of time.</p>
<p>Its goal is maximize time on site.</p>
<p>And so there is a rivalry where there should be a fiduciary contract.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually a huge deal.</p>
<p>And I think if we said, could we apply Facebook like technology to develop people&rsquo;s citizenry</p>
<p>capacity, right?</p>
<p>To develop their personal health and wellbeing and habits as well as their cognitive understanding,</p>
<p>the complexity with which they can process the health of their relationships, that would</p>
<p>be amazing to start to explore.</p>
<p>And this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is a</p>
<p>major step function in the physical tech, it obsoletes the previous social tech and</p>
<p>the new social tech has to emerge.</p>
<p>What I would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the world today, the</p>
<p>more top down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to emerge,</p>
<p>the digital technology started to emerge, they were in a position for better long term</p>
<p>planning and better coordination.</p>
<p>And so the authoritarian states started applying the exponential tech intentionally to make</p>
<p>more effective authoritarian states.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s everything from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine</p>
<p>learning systems to the Sesame credit system to all those types of things.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re upgrading their social tech using the exponential tech.</p>
<p>Otherwise within a nation state like the US, but democratic open societies, the countries,</p>
<p>the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes a better open society,</p>
<p>meaning better emergent order.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, well, the corporations are doing that and the state is doing the relatively</p>
<p>little thing it would do aligned with the previous corporate law that no longer is relevant</p>
<p>because there wasn&rsquo;t fiduciary responsibility for things like that.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network dynamics,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Where YouTube has more users than Vimeo and every other video player together.</p>
<p>Amazon has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together.</p>
<p>You get one big dog per vertical because of network effect, which is a kind of organic</p>
<p>monopoly that the previous antitrust law didn&rsquo;t even have a place, that wasn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>Antimonopoly was only something that emerged in the space of government contracts.</p>
<p>So what we see is that the new exponential technology is being directed by authoritarian</p>
<p>nation states to make better authoritarian nation states and by corporations to make</p>
<p>more powerful corporations.</p>
<p>Powerful corporations, when we think about the Scottish enlightenment, when the idea</p>
<p>of markets was being advanced, the modern kind of ideas of markets, the biggest corporation</p>
<p>was tiny compared to what the biggest corporation today is.</p>
<p>So the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny.</p>
<p>And the asymmetry now in terms of the total technology it employs, total amount of money,</p>
<p>total amount of information processing is so many orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>And rather than there be demand for an authentic thing that creates a basis for supply, as</p>
<p>supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the demand wasn&rsquo;t coordinated</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have a labor union of all the customers working together, but you do</p>
<p>have a coordination on the supply side.</p>
<p>Supply started to recognize that it could manufacture demand.</p>
<p>It could make people want shit that they didn&rsquo;t want before that maybe wouldn&rsquo;t increase their</p>
<p>happiness in a meaningful way, might increase addiction.</p>
<p>Addiction is a very good way to manufacture demand.</p>
<p>And so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and you have</p>
<p>to have it for status or whatever it is, the intelligence of the market was breaking.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for</p>
<p>things that are really meaningful.</p>
<p>We were able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather than the higher ones.</p>
<p>The addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn&rsquo;t actually make</p>
<p>them happy or make the world better.</p>
<p>And so we really also have to update our theory of markets because behavioral econ showed</p>
<p>that homo economicus, the rational actor is not really a thing, but particularly at greater</p>
<p>and greater scale can&rsquo;t really be a thing.</p>
<p>Voluntaryism isn&rsquo;t a thing where if my company doesn&rsquo;t want to advertise on Facebook, I just</p>
<p>will lose to the companies that do because that&rsquo;s where all the fucking attention is.</p>
<p>And so then I can say it&rsquo;s voluntary, but it&rsquo;s not really if there&rsquo;s a functional monopoly.</p>
<p>Same if I&rsquo;m going to sell on Amazon or things like that.</p>
<p>So what I would say is these corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states</p>
<p>in some ways.</p>
<p>And they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states, the open societies.</p>
<p>So the democracies are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of</p>
<p>new tech companies that are kind of a new feudalism, tech feudalism, because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a democracy inside of a tech company or the supply and demand relationship when you have</p>
<p>manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type functions.</p>
<p>And so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian nation</p>
<p>states controlling it.</p>
<p>And those attractors are both shitty.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m interested in the application of exponential tech to making better social tech</p>
<p>that makes emergent order possible and where then that emergent order can bind and direct</p>
<p>the exponential tech in fundamentally healthy, not X risk oriented directions.</p>
<p>I think the relationship of social tech and physical tech can make it.</p>
<p>I think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech, but it&rsquo;s not given</p>
<p>that we do.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t make better social tech, then I think the physical tech empowers really</p>
<p>shitty social tech that is not a world that we want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a road we want to go down, but I tend to believe that the market</p>
<p>will create exactly the thing you&rsquo;re talking about, which I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money to be made in creating a social tech that creates a better citizen, that creates</p>
<p>a better human being.</p>
<p>Your description of Facebook and so on, which is a system that creates addiction, which</p>
<p>manufactures demand, is not obviously inherently the consequence of the markets.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s the first stage of us, like baby deer trying to figure out how to</p>
<p>use the internet.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s much more money to be made with something that creates compersion</p>
<p>and love.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>I mean, I really, we can have this, I can make the business case for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I don&rsquo;t think we want to really have that discussion, but do you have</p>
<p>some hope that that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>I guess if not, then how do we fix the system of markets that worked so well for the United</p>
<p>States for so long?</p>
<p>Like I said, every social tech worked for a while.</p>
<p>Like tribalism worked well for two or 300,000 years.</p>
<p>I think social tech has to keep evolving.</p>
<p>The social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to keep evolving</p>
<p>as our physical tech does.</p>
<p>So I think the thing that we call markets, of course we can try to say, oh, even biology</p>
<p>runs on markets.</p>
<p>But the thing that we call markets, the underlying theory, homo economicus, demand, driving supply,</p>
<p>that thing broke.</p>
<p>It broke with scale in particular and a few other things.</p>
<p>So it needs updated in a really fundamental way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something even deeper than making money happening that in some ways will</p>
<p>obsolete money making.</p>
<p>I think capitalism is not about business.</p>
<p>So if you think about business, I&rsquo;m going to produce a good or a service that people</p>
<p>want and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the world of business, but that&rsquo;s not capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism is the management and allocation of capital, which financial services was a</p>
<p>tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of the total market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different creature.</p>
<p>So if I was in business and I was producing a good or service and I was saving up enough</p>
<p>money that I started to be able to invest that money and gain interest or do things</p>
<p>like that, I start realizing I&rsquo;m making more money on my money than I&rsquo;m making on producing</p>
<p>the goods and services.</p>
<p>So I stop even paying attention to goods and services and start paying attention to making</p>
<p>money on money and how do I utilize capital to create more capital.</p>
<p>And capital gives me more optionality because I can buy anything with it than a particular</p>
<p>good or service that only some people want.</p>
<p>Capitalism ‚Äì more capital ended up meaning more control.</p>
<p>I could put more people under my employment.</p>
<p>I could buy larger pieces of land, novel access to resource, mines, and put more technology</p>
<p>under my employment.</p>
<p>So it meant increased agency and also increased control.</p>
<p>I think attentionalism is even more powerful.</p>
<p>So rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in</p>
<p>the least work they can, there&rsquo;s a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable</p>
<p>than slavery, right?</p>
<p>Have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead and nobody</p>
<p>has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever.</p>
<p>This is a cynical take but a meaningful take.</p>
<p>So people ‚Äì so capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior, right?</p>
<p>And yet where people still feel free in some meaningful way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not feeling like they&rsquo;re going to be punished by the state if they don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like punished by the market via homelessness or something.</p>
<p>But the market is this invisible thing I can&rsquo;t put an agent on so it feels like free.</p>
<p>And so if you want to affect people&rsquo;s behavior and still have them feel free, capital ends</p>
<p>up being a way to do that.</p>
<p>But I think affecting their attention is even deeper because if I can affect their attention,</p>
<p>I can both affect what they want and what they believe and what they feel.</p>
<p>And we statistically know this very clearly.</p>
<p>Facebook has done studies that based on changing the feed, it can change beliefs, emotional</p>
<p>dispositions, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a way that the harvest and directing of attention is even a more</p>
<p>powerful system than capitalism.</p>
<p>It is effective in capitalism to generate capital, but I think it also generates influence</p>
<p>beyond what capital can do.</p>
<p>And so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type of tech to direct other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attention?</p>
<p>If so, towards what?</p>
<p>Towards what metrics of what a good civilization and good human life would be?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the oversight process?</p>
<p>What is the&hellip;</p>
<p>Transparency.</p>
<p>I can answer all the things you&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>
<p>I can build, I guarantee you if I&rsquo;m not such a lazy ass, I&rsquo;ll be part of the many people</p>
<p>doing this as transparency and control, giving control to individual people.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe the corporation has coordination on its goals that all of its customers or</p>
<p>users together don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some asymmetry of its goals, but maybe I could actually help all of</p>
<p>the customers to coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating</p>
<p>them adequately about the effects, the externalities on them.</p>
<p>This is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their minds, their beings, their families, their relationships, such that they will in</p>
<p>group change their behavior.</p>
<p>One way of saying what you&rsquo;re saying, I think, is that you think that you can rescue homo</p>
<p>economicus from the rational actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose</p>
<p>the best one at the best price, the kind of Rand von Mises Hayek, that you can rescue</p>
<p>that from Dan Ariely and behavioral econ that says that&rsquo;s actually not how people make choices.</p>
<p>They make it based on status hacking, largely whether it&rsquo;s good for them or not in the long</p>
<p>term.</p>
<p>And the large asymmetric corporation can run propaganda and narrative warfare that hits</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s status buttons and their limbic hijacks and their lots of other things in ways that</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t even perceive that are happening.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not paying attention to that.</p>
<p>The site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever else.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying, I think we can recover homo economicus.</p>
<p>And not just through a single mechanism of technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the, not to keep mentioning the guy, but platforms like Joe Rogan and so on, that</p>
<p>make help make viral the ways that the education of negative externalities can become viral</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p>So interestingly, I actually agree with you that</p>
<p>I got them that we four and a half hours in that we can take can do some good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, see, what you&rsquo;re talking about is the application of tech here, broadcast tech where</p>
<p>you can speak to a lot of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken to differently,</p>
<p>which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more</p>
<p>like Facebook&rsquo;s tech.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, we&rsquo;ll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then the word</p>
<p>of mouth is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>You need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like lands a catapult or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right weapon is, but then it just spreads the word of mouth through</p>
<p>all kinds of tech, including Facebook.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s come back to the fundamental thing.</p>
<p>The fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting</p>
<p>parts of ourself, actually having more harmony than they might have to a family, extended</p>
<p>family, local, all the way up to global.</p>
<p>We want emergent order where our choices have more alignment, right?</p>
<p>We want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than we want fundamentally different</p>
<p>things or make totally different sense of the world where warfare of some kind becomes</p>
<p>the only solution.</p>
<p>Emergent order requires us in our choice making, requires us being able to have related sense</p>
<p>making and related meaning making processes.</p>
<p>Can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity</p>
<p>to do that where the technology called a town hall, the social tech that we&rsquo;d all get together</p>
<p>and talk obviously is very scale limited and it&rsquo;s also oriented to geography rather than</p>
<p>networks of aligned interest.</p>
<p>Can we build new better versions of those types of things?</p>
<p>And going back to the idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive</p>
<p>education and the science of government, which include being able to understand things like</p>
<p>asymmetric information warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize</p>
<p>adequately.</p>
<p>Can you utilize some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive</p>
<p>education of the people and maybe comprehensive informativeness, so both fixing the decay</p>
<p>in both education and the fourth estate that have happened so that people can start self</p>
<p>organizing to then influence the corporations, the nation states to do different things and</p>
<p>or build new ones themselves?</p>
<p>Yeah, fundamentally that&rsquo;s the thing that has to happen.</p>
<p>The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape that the world never had.</p>
<p>The nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required this whole Bretton Woods</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape, our existing problem solving processes</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t doing a good job.</p>
<p>We have had more countries get nukes, we have a nuclear de proliferation, we haven&rsquo;t achieved</p>
<p>any of the UN sustainable development goals, we haven&rsquo;t kept any of the new categories</p>
<p>of tech from making arms races, so our global coordination is not adequate to the problem</p>
<p>landscape.</p>
<p>So we need fundamentally better problem solving processes, a market or a state is a problem</p>
<p>solving process.</p>
<p>We need better ones that can do the speed and scale of the current issues.</p>
<p>Right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we regulated DDT out of</p>
<p>existence or cigarettes not for people under 18, they had already killed so many people</p>
<p>and we let the market do the thing.</p>
<p>But as Elon has made the point that won&rsquo;t work for AI, by the time we recognize afterwards</p>
<p>that we have an auto poetic AI that&rsquo;s a problem, you won&rsquo;t be able to reverse it, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a number of things that when you&rsquo;re dealing with tech that is either self replicating</p>
<p>and disintermediate humans to keep going, doesn&rsquo;t need humans to keep going, or you</p>
<p>have tech that just has exponentially fast effects, your regulation has to come early.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t come after the effects have happened, the negative effects have happened because</p>
<p>the negative effects could be too big too quickly.</p>
<p>So we basically need new problem solving processes that do better at being able to internalize</p>
<p>this externality, solve the problems on the right time scale and the right geographic</p>
<p>scale.</p>
<p>And those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting them and</p>
<p>being able to participate in their development, which is what I would call kind of a new cultural</p>
<p>enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen, where people start understanding the new power</p>
<p>that exponential tech offers, the way that it is actually damaging current governance</p>
<p>structures that we care about, and creating an extra landscape, but could also be redirected</p>
<p>towards more protopic purposes, and then saying, how do we rebuild new social institutions?</p>
<p>What are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale</p>
<p>and time?</p>
<p>And how can the people actually participate to build those things?</p>
<p>The solution that I see working requires a process like that.</p>
<p>And the result maximizes love.</p>
<p>So again, Elon would be right that love is the answer.</p>
<p>Let me take you back from the scale of societies to the scale that&rsquo;s far, far more important,</p>
<p>which is the scale of family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written a blog post about your dad.</p>
<p>We have various flavors of relationships with our fathers.</p>
<p>What have you learned about life from your dad?</p>
<p>Well, people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that I learned</p>
<p>that I really appreciated.</p>
<p>If I was to kind of summarize at a high level, I had a really incredible dad, very, very</p>
<p>unusually positive set of experiences.</p>
<p>We were homeschooled, and he was committed to work from home to be available and prioritize</p>
<p>fathering in a really deep way.</p>
<p>And as a super gifted, super loving, very unique man, he also had his unique issues</p>
<p>that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance, and those things often go together.</p>
<p>And I say that because I think I had some unusual gifts and also some unusual difficulties.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s useful for everybody to know their path probably has both of those.</p>
<p>But if I was to say kind of the essence of one of the things my dad taught me across</p>
<p>a lot of lessons was like the intersection of self empowerment, ideas and practices that</p>
<p>self empower, towards collective good, towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self.</p>
<p>And he both said that a million different ways, taught it in a million different ways.</p>
<p>When we were doing construction and he was teaching me how to build a house, we were</p>
<p>putting the wires to the walls before the drywall went on, he made sure that the way</p>
<p>that we put the wires through was beautiful.</p>
<p>Like that the height of the holes was similar, that we twisted the wires in a particular</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like no one&rsquo;s ever going to see it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, if a job&rsquo;s worth doing, it&rsquo;s worth doing well, and excellence is its own</p>
<p>reward.</p>
<p>And those types of ideas.</p>
<p>And if there was a really shitty job to do, he&rsquo;d say, see the job, do the job, stay out</p>
<p>of the misery.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t indulge any negativity, do the things that need done.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s an empowerment and a nobility together.</p>
<p>And yeah, extraordinarily fortunate.</p>
<p>Is there ways you think you could have been a better son?</p>
<p>Is there things you regret?</p>
<p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>Let me first say, just as a bit of a criticism, that what kind of man do you think you are</p>
<p>not wearing a suit and tie, if a real man should?</p>
<p>Exactly I agree with your dad on that point.</p>
<p>You mentioned offline that he suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie.</p>
<p>But outside of that, is there ways you could have been a better son?</p>
<p>Maybe next time on your show, I&rsquo;ll wear a suit and tie.</p>
<p>My dad would be happy about that.</p>
<p>I can answer the question later in life, not early.</p>
<p>I had just a huge amount of respect and reverence for my dad when I was young.</p>
<p>So I was asking myself that question a lot.</p>
<p>So there weren&rsquo;t a lot of things I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t seeking to apply.</p>
<p>There was a phase when I went through my kind of individuation, differentiation, where I</p>
<p>had to make him excessively wrong about too many things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I had to, but I did.</p>
<p>And he had a lot of kind of nonstandard model beliefs about things, whether early kind of</p>
<p>ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary theory or alternate models of physics.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t irrational, but they didn&rsquo;t all have the standard of epistemic proof that</p>
<p>I would need.</p>
<p>And I went through, and some of them were kind of spiritual ideas as well, I went through</p>
<p>a phase in my early 20s where I kind of had the attitude that Dawkins or a Christopher</p>
<p>Hitchens has that can kind of be like excessively certain and sanctimonious, applying their</p>
<p>reductionist philosophy of science to everything and kind of brutally dismissive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m embarrassed by that phase.</p>
<p>Not to say anything about those men and their path, but for myself.</p>
<p>And so during that time, I was more dismissive of my dad&rsquo;s epistemology than I would have</p>
<p>liked to have been.</p>
<p>I got to correct that later and apologize for it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the first thought that came to mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written the following.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the experience countless times, making love, watching a sunset, listening to music,</p>
<p>feeling the breeze, that I would sign up for this whole life and all of its pains just</p>
<p>to experience this exact moment.</p>
<p>This is a kind of wordless knowing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most important and real truth I know, that experience itself is infinitely</p>
<p>meaningful and pain is temporary.</p>
<p>And seen clearly, even the suffering is filled with beauty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life, such an unreasonable</p>
<p>fortune.</p>
<p>A few words of gratitude from you, beautifully written.</p>
<p>Is there some beautiful moments?</p>
<p>Now you have experienced countless lives worth of those moments, but is there some things</p>
<p>that if you could, in your darker moments, you can go to to relive, to remind yourself</p>
<p>that the whole ride is worthwhile?</p>
<p>Maybe skip the making love part.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to know about that.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel unreasonably fortunate that it is such a humongous list because, I mean,</p>
<p>I feel fortunate to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of</p>
<p>seeing things that makes me see things that way.</p>
<p>So I can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for granted really</p>
<p>wonderful things, but I can&rsquo;t take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that</p>
<p>even gave me that possibility.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not just with my wife, it&rsquo;s with every person who I really love when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking and I look at their face, I, in the context of a conversation, feel overwhelmed</p>
<p>by how lucky I am to get to know them.</p>
<p>And like there&rsquo;s never been someone like them in all of history and there never will be</p>
<p>again and they might be gone tomorrow, I might be gone tomorrow and like I get this moment</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>And when you take in the uniqueness of that fully and the beauty of it, it&rsquo;s overwhelmingly</p>
<p>beautiful.</p>
<p>And I remember the first time I did a big dose of mushrooms and I was looking at a tree</p>
<p>for a long time and I was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was.</p>
<p>And it was a tree outside the front of my house that I&rsquo;d walked by a million times and</p>
<p>never looked at like this.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t the dose of mushrooms where I was hallucinating like where the tree was</p>
<p>purple.</p>
<p>Like the tree still looked like, if I had to describe it, it&rsquo;s green and it has leaves,</p>
<p>looks like this, but it was way fucking more beautiful, like capturing than it normally</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, why is it so beautiful if I would describe it the same way?</p>
<p>And I realized I had no thoughts taking me anywhere else.</p>
<p>Like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually shutting the narrative</p>
<p>off that would have me be distracted so I could really see the tree.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, fuck, when I get off these mushrooms, I&rsquo;m going to practice seeing the</p>
<p>tree because it&rsquo;s always that beautiful and I just miss it.</p>
<p>And so I practice being with it and quieting the rest of the mind and then being like,</p>
<p>wow.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not mushrooms, like people have peak experiences where they&rsquo;ll see life and</p>
<p>how incredible it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that I had this exact same experience on quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone</p>
<p>and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it, appreciating the undistorted beauty of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny to me that here&rsquo;s two humans, very different with very different journeys</p>
<p>or at some moment in time, both looking at a tree like idiots for hours and just in awe</p>
<p>and happy to be alive.</p>
<p>And yeah, even just that moment alone is worth living for, but you did say humans and we</p>
<p>have a moment together as two humans and you mentioned shots that I have to ask, what are</p>
<p>we looking at?</p>
<p>When I went to go get a smoothie before coming here, I got you a keto smoothie that you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want because you&rsquo;re not just keto, but fasting.</p>
<p>But I saw the thing with you and your dad where you did shots together and this place</p>
<p>happened to have shots of ginger, turmeric, cayenne juice of some kind.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t necessarily plan it for being on the show, I just brought it, but we can</p>
<p>do it that way.</p>
<p>I think we shall toast like heroes, Daniel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>What do we toast to?</p>
<p>We toast to this moment, this unique moment that we get to share together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful to be here in this moment with you and yeah, I&rsquo;m grateful that you invited</p>
<p>me here.</p>
<p>We met for the first time and I will never be the same for the good and the bad, I am.</p>
<p>That is really interesting.</p>
<p>That feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and I were drinking.</p>
<p>So I feel like a better man already, Daniel, this is one of the best conversations I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever had.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to have many more.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>This has been an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Thank you for wasting all your time today.</p>
<p>I want to say in terms of what you&rsquo;re mentioning about like the, that you work in machine learning</p>
<p>and the optimism that wants to look at the issues, but wants to look at how this increased</p>
<p>technological power could be applied to solving them and that even thinking about the broadcast</p>
<p>of like, can I help people understand the issues better and help organize them?</p>
<p>Like fundamentally you&rsquo;re oriented like Wikipedia, what I see, to really try to tend to the information</p>
<p>commons without another agentic interest distorting it.</p>
<p>And for you to be able to get guys like Lee Smolin and Roger Penrose and like the greatest</p>
<p>thinkers of, that are alive and have them on the show and most people would never be</p>
<p>exposed to them and talk about it in a way that people can understand, I think it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible service.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing great work.</p>
<p>So I was really happy to hear from you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Daniel.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger and thank you</p>
<p>to Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought</p>
<p>with sticks and stones.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
