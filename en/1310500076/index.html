    <p>The following is a conversation with John Hopfield,</p>
<p>professor at Princeton, whose life&rsquo;s work weaved beautifully</p>
<p>through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.</p>
<p>Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology</p>
<p>through the piercing eyes of a physicist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s perhaps best known for his work</p>
<p>on associative neural networks,</p>
<p>now known as Hopfield networks,</p>
<p>that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed</p>
<p>the development of the modern field of deep learning.</p>
<p>As his 2019 Franklin Medal in Physics Award states,</p>
<p>he applied concepts of theoretical physics</p>
<p>to provide new insights on important biological questions</p>
<p>in a variety of areas, including genetics and neuroscience</p>
<p>with significant impact on machine learning.</p>
<p>And as John says in his 2018 article titled,</p>
<p>Now What?, his accomplishments have often come about</p>
<p>by asking that very question, now what?</p>
<p>And often responding by a major change of direction.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,</p>
<p>and Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A M.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LexPodcast.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading,</p>
<p>let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that works behind the scenes</p>
<p>to create the abstraction of fractional orders</p>
<p>is to me an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers</p>
<p>for solving a hard problem</p>
<p>that in the end provides an easy interface</p>
<p>that takes a step up the next layer of abstraction</p>
<p>over the stock market,</p>
<p>making trading more accessible for new investors</p>
<p>and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,</p>
<p>Google Play, and use code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that is helping advance robotics and STEM education</p>
<p>for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with John Hopfield.</p>
<p>What difference between biological neural networks</p>
<p>and artificial neural networks</p>
<p>is most captivating and profound to you?</p>
<p>At the higher philosophical level,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not get technical just yet.</p>
<p>But one of the things that very much intrigues me</p>
<p>is the fact that neurons have all kinds of components,</p>
<p>properties to them.</p>
<p>And in evolutionary biology,</p>
<p>if you have some little quirk</p>
<p>in how a molecule works or how a cell works,</p>
<p>and it can be made use of,</p>
<p>evolution will sharpen it up</p>
<p>and make it into a useful feature rather than a glitch.</p>
<p>And so you expect in neurobiology for evolution</p>
<p>to have captured all kinds of possibilities</p>
<p>of getting neurons,</p>
<p>of how you get neurons to do things for you.</p>
<p>And that aspect has been completely suppressed</p>
<p>in artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>So the glitches become features</p>
<p>in the biological neural network.</p>
<p>They can.</p>
<p>Look, let me take one of the things</p>
<p>that I used to do research on.</p>
<p>If you take things which oscillate,</p>
<p>they have rhythms which are sort of close to each other.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances,</p>
<p>these things will have a phase transition</p>
<p>and suddenly the rhythm will,</p>
<p>everybody will fall into step.</p>
<p>There was a marvelous physical example of that</p>
<p>in the Millennium Bridge across the Thames River,</p>
<p>about, built about 2001.</p>
<p>And pedestrians walking across,</p>
<p>pedestrians don&rsquo;t walk synchronized,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t walk in lockstep.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all walking about the same frequency</p>
<p>and the bridge could sway at that frequency</p>
<p>and the slight sway made pedestrians tend a little bit</p>
<p>to lock into step and after a while,</p>
<p>the bridge was oscillating back and forth</p>
<p>and the pedestrians were walking in step to it.</p>
<p>And you could see it in the movies made out of the bridge.</p>
<p>And the engineers made a simple minor mistake.</p>
<p>They assume when you walk, it&rsquo;s step, step, step</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s back and forth motion.</p>
<p>But when you walk, it&rsquo;s also right foot left</p>
<p>with side to side motion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the side to side motion</p>
<p>for which the bridge was strong enough,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t stiff enough.</p>
<p>And as a result, you would feel the motion</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d fall into step with it.</p>
<p>And people were very uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p>They closed the bridge for two years</p>
<p>while they built stiffening for it.</p>
<p>Now, nerve cells produce action potentials.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of cells which are loosely coupled together</p>
<p>producing action potentials at the same rate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some circumstances</p>
<p>under which these things can lock together.</p>
<p>Other circumstances in which they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re fired together,</p>
<p>you can be sure that other cells are gonna notice it.</p>
<p>So you can make a computational feature out of this</p>
<p>in an evolving brain.</p>
<p>Most artificial neural networks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have action potentials,</p>
<p>let alone have the possibility for synchronizing them.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>So the evolutionary process</p>
<p>that builds on top of biological systems</p>
<p>leverages the weird mess of it somehow.</p>
<p>So how do you make sense of that ability</p>
<p>to leverage all the different kinds of complexities</p>
<p>in the biological brain?</p>
<p>Well, look, in the biological molecule level,</p>
<p>you have a piece of DNA</p>
<p>which encodes for a particular protein.</p>
<p>You could duplicate that piece of DNA</p>
<p>and now one part of it can code for that protein,</p>
<p>but the other one could itself change a little bit</p>
<p>and thus start coding for a molecule</p>
<p>which is slightly different.</p>
<p>Now, if that molecule was just slightly different,</p>
<p>had a function which helped any old chemical reaction</p>
<p>which was important to the cell,</p>
<p>you would go ahead and let that try,</p>
<p>and evolution would slowly improve that function.</p>
<p>And so you have the possibility of duplicating</p>
<p>and then having things drift apart.</p>
<p>One of them retain the old function,</p>
<p>the other one do something new for you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s evolutionary pressure to improve.</p>
<p>Look, there isn&rsquo;t in computers too,</p>
<p>but improvement has to do with closing some companies</p>
<p>and opening some others.</p>
<p>The evolutionary process looks a little different.</p>
<p>Yeah, similar timescale perhaps.</p>
<p>Much shorter in timescale.</p>
<p>Companies close, yeah, go bankrupt and are born,</p>
<p>yeah, shorter, but not much shorter.</p>
<p>Some companies last a century, but yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think of companies as a single organism</p>
<p>that builds and you all know, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating dual correspondence there</p>
<p>between biological organisms.</p>
<p>And companies have difficulty having a new product</p>
<p>competing with an old product.</p>
<p>When IBM built its first PC, you probably read the book,</p>
<p>they made a little isolated internal unit to make the PC.</p>
<p>And for the first time in IBM&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t insist that you build it out of IBM components.</p>
<p>But they understood that they could get into this market,</p>
<p>which is a very different thing</p>
<p>by completely changing their culture.</p>
<p>And biology finds other markets in a more adaptive way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s better at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better at that kind of integration.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;ve already said it,</p>
<p>but what to use the most beautiful aspect</p>
<p>or mechanism of the human mind?</p>
<p>Is it the adaptive, the ability to adapt</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve described, or is there some other little quirk</p>
<p>that you particularly like?</p>
<p>Adaptation is everything when you get down to it.</p>
<p>But the difference, there are differences between adaptation</p>
<p>where your learning goes on only over generations</p>
<p>and over evolutionary time,</p>
<p>where your learning goes on at the time scale</p>
<p>of one individual who must learn from the environment</p>
<p>during that individual&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>And biology has both kinds of learning in it.</p>
<p>And the thing which makes neurobiology hard</p>
<p>is that a mathematical system, as it were,</p>
<p>built on this other kind of evolutionary system.</p>
<p>What do you mean by mathematical system?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the math and the biology?</p>
<p>Well, when you talk to a computer scientist</p>
<p>about neural networks, it&rsquo;s all math.</p>
<p>The fact that biology actually came about from evolution,</p>
<p>and the fact that biology is about a system</p>
<p>which you can build in three dimensions.</p>
<p>If you look at computer chips,</p>
<p>computer chips are basically two dimensional structures,</p>
<p>maybe 2.1 dimensions, but they really have difficulty</p>
<p>doing three dimensional wiring.</p>
<p>Biology is, the neocortex is actually also sheet like,</p>
<p>and it sits on top of the white matter,</p>
<p>which is about 10 times the volume of the gray matter</p>
<p>and contains all what you might call the wires.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a huge, the effect of computer structure</p>
<p>on what is easy and what is hard is immense.</p>
<p>And biology does, it makes some things easy</p>
<p>that are very difficult to understand</p>
<p>how to do computationally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can&rsquo;t do simple floating point</p>
<p>arithmetic because it&rsquo;s awfully stupid.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying this kind of three dimensional</p>
<p>complicated structure makes, it&rsquo;s still math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still doing math.</p>
<p>The kind of math it&rsquo;s doing enables you to solve problems</p>
<p>of a very different kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So you mentioned two kinds of adaptation,</p>
<p>the evolutionary adaptation and the adaptation</p>
<p>or learning at the scale of a single human life.</p>
<p>Which do you, which is particularly beautiful to you</p>
<p>and interesting from a research</p>
<p>and from just a human perspective?</p>
<p>And which is more powerful?</p>
<p>I find things most interesting that I begin to see</p>
<p>how to get into the edges of them</p>
<p>and tease them apart a little bit and see how they work.</p>
<p>And since I can&rsquo;t see the evolutionary process going on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in awe of it.</p>
<p>But I find it just a black hole as far as trying</p>
<p>to understand what to do.</p>
<p>And so in a certain sense, I&rsquo;m in awe of it,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t be interested in working on it.</p>
<p>The human life&rsquo;s time scale is however thing</p>
<p>you can tease apart and study.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can do, there&rsquo;s developmental neurobiology</p>
<p>which understands how the connections</p>
<p>and how the structure evolves from a combination</p>
<p>of what the genetics is like and the real,</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re building a system in three dimensions.</p>
<p>In just days and months, those early days</p>
<p>of a human life are really interesting.</p>
<p>They are and of course, there are times</p>
<p>of immense cell multiplication.</p>
<p>There are also times of the greatest cell death</p>
<p>in the brain is during infancy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turnover.</p>
<p>So what is not effective, what is not wired well enough</p>
<p>to use at the moment, throw it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mysterious process.</p>
<p>From, let me ask, from what field do you think</p>
<p>the biggest breakthrough is in understanding</p>
<p>the mind will come in the next decades?</p>
<p>Is it neuroscience, computer science, neurobiology,</p>
<p>psychology, physics, maybe math, maybe literature?</p>
<p>Well, of course, I see the world always</p>
<p>through a lens of physics.</p>
<p>I grew up in physics and the way I pick problems</p>
<p>is very characteristic of physics</p>
<p>and of an intellectual background which is not psychology,</p>
<p>which is not chemistry and so on and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, both of your parents are physicists.</p>
<p>Both of my parents were physicists</p>
<p>and the real thing I got out of that was a feeling</p>
<p>that the world is an understandable place</p>
<p>and if you do enough experiments and think about</p>
<p>what they mean and structure things</p>
<p>so you can do the mathematics of the,</p>
<p>relevant to the experiments, you ought to be able</p>
<p>to understand how things work.</p>
<p>But that was, that was a few years ago.</p>
<p>Did you change your mind at all through many decades</p>
<p>of trying to understand the mind,</p>
<p>of studying in different kinds of ways?</p>
<p>Not even the mind, just biological systems.</p>
<p>You still have hope that physics, that you can understand?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of what do you mean by understand?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>When I taught freshman physics, I used to say,</p>
<p>I wanted to get physics to understand the subject,</p>
<p>to understand Newton&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want them simply to memorize a set of examples</p>
<p>to which they knew the equations to write down</p>
<p>to generate the answers.</p>
<p>I had this nebulous idea of understanding</p>
<p>so that if you looked at a situation,</p>
<p>you could say, oh, I expect the ball to make that trajectory</p>
<p>or I expect some intuitive notion of understanding</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how to express that very well</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never known how to express it well.</p>
<p>And you run smack up against it when you do these,</p>
<p>look at these simple neural nets,</p>
<p>feed forward neural nets, which do amazing things</p>
<p>and yet, you know, contain nothing of the essence</p>
<p>of what I would have felt was understanding.</p>
<p>Understanding is more than just an enormous lookup table.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s linger on that.</p>
<p>How sure you are of that?</p>
<p>What if the table gets really big?</p>
<p>So, I mean, asked another way,</p>
<p>these feed forward neural networks,</p>
<p>do you think they&rsquo;ll ever understand?</p>
<p>Could answer that in two ways.</p>
<p>I think if you look at real systems,</p>
<p>feedback is an essential aspect</p>
<p>of how these real systems compute.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I have a mathematical system</p>
<p>with feedback, I know I can unlayer this and do it,</p>
<p>but I have an exponential expansion</p>
<p>in the amount of stuff I have to build</p>
<p>if I can resolve the problem that way.</p>
<p>So feedback is essential.</p>
<p>So we can talk even about recurrent neural nets,</p>
<p>so recurrence, but do you think all the pieces are there</p>
<p>to achieve understanding through these simple mechanisms?</p>
<p>Like back to our original question,</p>
<p>what is the fundamental, is there a fundamental difference</p>
<p>between artificial neural networks and biological</p>
<p>or is it just a bunch of surface stuff?</p>
<p>Suppose you ask a neurosurgeon, when is somebody dead?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll probably go back to saying,</p>
<p>well, I can look at the brain rhythms</p>
<p>and tell you this is a brain</p>
<p>which has never could have functioned again.</p>
<p>This is one of the, this other one is one of the stuff</p>
<p>we treat it well is still recoverable.</p>
<p>And then just do that by some electrodes</p>
<p>looking at simple electrical patterns,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t look in any detail at all</p>
<p>what individual neurons are doing.</p>
<p>These rhythms are utterly absent</p>
<p>from anything which goes on at Google.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the rhythms.</p>
<p>But the rhythms what?</p>
<p>So, well, that&rsquo;s like comparing, okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re comparing the greatest classical musician</p>
<p>in the world to a child first learning to play.</p>
<p>The question I&rsquo;m at, but they&rsquo;re still both</p>
<p>playing the piano.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking, is there, will it ever go on at Google?</p>
<p>Do you have a hope?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re one of the seminal figures</p>
<p>in both launching both disciplines,</p>
<p>both sides of the river.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to go on generation after generation.</p>
<p>The way it has where what you might call</p>
<p>the AI computer science community says,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the following.</p>
<p>This is our model of neurobiology at the moment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend it&rsquo;s good enough</p>
<p>and do everything we can with it.</p>
<p>And it does interesting things.</p>
<p>And after a while it sort of grinds into the sand</p>
<p>and you say, ah, something else is needed for neurobiology.</p>
<p>And some other grand thing comes in</p>
<p>and enables you to go a lot further.</p>
<p>What will go into the sand again?</p>
<p>And I think it could be generations of this evolution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of them.</p>
<p>And each one is going to get you further</p>
<p>into what a brain does.</p>
<p>And in some sense, past the Turing test longer</p>
<p>and in more broad aspects.</p>
<p>And how many of these are going to have to be</p>
<p>before you say, I&rsquo;ve made something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a human, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But your sense is it might be a couple.</p>
<p>My sense is it might be a couple more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And going back to my brainwaves as it were.</p>
<p>Yes, from the AI point of view,</p>
<p>they would say, ah, maybe these are an epiphenomenon</p>
<p>and not important at all.</p>
<p>The first car I had, a real wreck of a 1936 Dodge,</p>
<p>go above about 45 miles an hour and the wheels would shimmy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good speedometer that.</p>
<p>Now, nobody designed the car that way.</p>
<p>The car is malfunctioning to have that.</p>
<p>But in biology, if it were useful to know</p>
<p>when are you going more than 45 miles an hour,</p>
<p>you just capture that.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t worry about where it came from.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long time before that kind of thing,</p>
<p>which can take place in large complex networks of things</p>
<p>is actually used in the computation.</p>
<p>Look, how many transistors are there</p>
<p>in your laptop these days?</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know the number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the scale of 10 to the 10.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the number either.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And all the transistors are somewhat similar.</p>
<p>And most physical systems with that many parts,</p>
<p>all of which are similar, have collective properties.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Sound waves in air, earthquakes,</p>
<p>what have you, have collective properties.</p>
<p>Weather.</p>
<p>There are no collective properties used</p>
<p>in artificial neural networks, in AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very.</p>
<p>If biology uses them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take us to more generations of things</p>
<p>for people to actually dig in</p>
<p>and see how they are used and what they mean.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re very right.</p>
<p>We might have to return several times to neurobiology</p>
<p>and try to make our transistors more messy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>At the same time, the simple ones will conquer big aspects.</p>
<p>And I think one of the most, biggest surprises to me was</p>
<p>how well learning systems</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re manifestly nonbiological,</p>
<p>how important they can be actually,</p>
<p>and how important and how useful they can be in AI.</p>
<p>So if we can just take a stroll to some of your work.</p>
<p>If we can just take a stroll to some of your work</p>
<p>that is incredibly surprising,</p>
<p>that it works as well as it does,</p>
<p>that launched a lot of the recent work with neural networks.</p>
<p>If we go to what are now called Hopfield networks,</p>
<p>can you tell me what is associative memory in the mind</p>
<p>for the human side?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore memory for a bit.</p>
<p>Okay, what do you mean by associative memory is,</p>
<p>ah, you have a memory of each of your friends.</p>
<p>Your friend has all kinds of properties</p>
<p>from what they look like, what their voice sounds like,</p>
<p>to where they went to college, where you met them,</p>
<p>go on and on, what science papers they&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>And if I start talking about a 5 foot 10 wire,</p>
<p>cognitive scientist who&rsquo;s got a very bad back,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t take very long for you to say,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s talking about Jeff Hinton.</p>
<p>I never mentioned the name or anything very particular.</p>
<p>But somehow a few facts that are associated</p>
<p>with a particular person enables you to get a hold</p>
<p>of the rest of the facts.</p>
<p>Or not the rest of them, another subset of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this ability to link things together,</p>
<p>link experiences together, which goes under</p>
<p>the general name of associative memory.</p>
<p>And a large part of intelligent behavior</p>
<p>is actually just large associative memories at work,</p>
<p>as far as I can see.</p>
<p>What do you think is the mechanism of how it works?</p>
<p>What do you think is the mechanism of how it works</p>
<p>in the mind?</p>
<p>Is it a mystery to you still?</p>
<p>Do you have inklings of how this essential thing</p>
<p>for cognition works?</p>
<p>What I made 35 years ago was, of course,</p>
<p>a crude physics model to actually enable you</p>
<p>to understand my old sense of understanding</p>
<p>as a physicist, because you could say,</p>
<p>ah, I understand why this goes to stable states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like things going downhill.</p>
<p>And that gives you something with which to think</p>
<p>in physical terms rather than only in mathematical terms.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve created these associative artificial networks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at what I did,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t at all describe a system which gracefully learns.</p>
<p>I described a system in which you could understand</p>
<p>how learning could link things together,</p>
<p>how very crudely it might learn.</p>
<p>One of the things which intrigues me</p>
<p>as I reinvestigate that system now to some extent is,</p>
<p>look, I see you, I&rsquo;ll see you every second</p>
<p>for the next hour or what have you.</p>
<p>Each look at you is a little bit different.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t store all those second by second images.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t store 3,000 images.</p>
<p>I somehow compact this information.</p>
<p>So I now have a view of you,</p>
<p>which I can use.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t slavishly remember anything in particular,</p>
<p>but it compacts the information into useful chunks,</p>
<p>which are somehow these chunks,</p>
<p>which are not just activities of neurons,</p>
<p>bigger things than that,</p>
<p>which are the real entities which are useful to you.</p>
<p>Which are useful to you.</p>
<p>Useful to you to describe,</p>
<p>to compress this information coming at you.</p>
<p>And you have to compress it in such a way</p>
<p>that if the information comes in just like this again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t bother to rewrite it or efforts to rewrite it</p>
<p>simply do not yield anything</p>
<p>because those things are already written.</p>
<p>And that needs to be not,</p>
<p>look this up, have I stored it somewhere already?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be something which is much more automatic</p>
<p>in the machine hardware.</p>
<p>Right, so in the human mind,</p>
<p>how complicated is that process do you think?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>feels weird to be sitting with John Hotfield</p>
<p>calling him Hotfield Networks, but.</p>
<p>It is weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, but nevertheless, that&rsquo;s what everyone calls him.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a simplification.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a physicist would do.</p>
<p>You and Richard Feynman sat down</p>
<p>and talked about associative memory.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the mind</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t quite simplify it so perfectly,</p>
<p>do you think that?</p>
<p>Well, let me backtrack just a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Biology is about dynamical systems.</p>
<p>Computers are dynamical systems.</p>
<p>You can ask, if you want to model biology,</p>
<p>if you want to model neurobiology,</p>
<p>what is the time scale?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dynamical system in which,</p>
<p>of a fairly fast time scale in which you could say,</p>
<p>the synapses don&rsquo;t change much during this computation,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll think of the synapses fixed</p>
<p>and just do the dynamics of the activity.</p>
<p>Or you can say, the synapses are changing fast enough</p>
<p>that I have to have the synaptic dynamics</p>
<p>working at the same time as the system dynamics</p>
<p>in order to understand the biology.</p>
<p>Most, if you look at the feedforward artificial neural nets,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all done as learnings.</p>
<p>First of all, I spend some time learning, not performing,</p>
<p>and I turn off learning and I turn off learning,</p>
<p>and I turn off learning and I perform.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not biology.</p>
<p>And so as I look more deeply at neurobiology,</p>
<p>even as associative memory,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to face the fact that the dynamics</p>
<p>of the synapse change is going on all the time.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t just get by by saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do the dynamics of activity with fixed synapses.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the synaptic, the dynamics of the synapses</p>
<p>is actually fundamental to the whole system.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily separating the time scales.</p>
<p>When the time scale&rsquo;s gonna be separated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s neat from the physicist&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or the mathematician&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily true in neurobiology.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of dancing beautifully</p>
<p>between showing a lot of respect to physics</p>
<p>and then also saying that physics</p>
<p>cannot quite reach the complexity of biology.</p>
<p>So where do you land?</p>
<p>Or do you continuously dance between the two points?</p>
<p>I continuously dance between them</p>
<p>because my whole notion of understanding</p>
<p>is that you can describe to somebody else</p>
<p>how something works in ways which are honest and believable</p>
<p>and still not describe all the nuts and bolts in detail.</p>
<p>Weather.</p>
<p>I can describe weather</p>
<p>as 10 to the 32 molecules colliding in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I can simulate weather that way if I have a big enough machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll simulate it accurately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no good for understanding.</p>
<p>If I want to understand things, I want to understand things</p>
<p>in terms of wind patterns, hurricanes,</p>
<p>pressure differentials, and so on,</p>
<p>all things as they&rsquo;re collective.</p>
<p>And the physicist in me always hopes</p>
<p>that biology will have some things</p>
<p>that can be said about it which are both true</p>
<p>and for which you don&rsquo;t need all the molecular details</p>
<p>as the molecules colliding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean from the roots of physics,</p>
<p>by understanding.</p>
<p>So what did, again, sorry,</p>
<p>but Hopfield Networks help you understand</p>
<p>what insight did give us about memory, about learning?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t give insights about learning.</p>
<p>They gave insights about how things having learned</p>
<p>could be expressed, how having learned a picture of you,</p>
<p>a picture of you reminds me of your name.</p>
<p>That would, but it didn&rsquo;t describe a reasonable way</p>
<p>of actually doing the learning.</p>
<p>They only said if you had previously learned</p>
<p>the connections of this kind of pattern,</p>
<p>would now be able to,</p>
<p>behave in a physical way was to say,</p>
<p>ah, if I put the part of the pattern in here,</p>
<p>the other part of the pattern will complete over here.</p>
<p>I could understand that physics,</p>
<p>if the right learning stuff had already been put in.</p>
<p>And it could understand why then putting in a picture</p>
<p>of somebody else would generate something else over here.</p>
<p>But it did not have a reasonable description</p>
<p>of the learning that was going on.</p>
<p>It did not have a reasonable description</p>
<p>of the learning process.</p>
<p>But even, so forget learning.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just a powerful concept</p>
<p>that sort of forming representations</p>
<p>that are useful to be robust,</p>
<p>you know, for error correction kind of thing.</p>
<p>So this is kind of what the biology does</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, and what my paper did was simply enable you,</p>
<p>there are lots of ways of being robust.</p>
<p>If you think of a dynamical system,</p>
<p>you think of a system where a path is going on in time.</p>
<p>And if you think for a computer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a computational path,</p>
<p>which is going on in a huge dimensional space</p>
<p>of ones and zeros.</p>
<p>And an error correction system is a system,</p>
<p>which if you get a little bit off that trajectory,</p>
<p>will push you back onto that trajectory again.</p>
<p>So you get to the same answer in spite of the fact</p>
<p>that there were things,</p>
<p>so that the computation wasn&rsquo;t being ideally done</p>
<p>all the way along the line.</p>
<p>And there are lots of models for error correction.</p>
<p>But one of the models for error correction is to say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a valley that you&rsquo;re following, flowing down.</p>
<p>And if you push a little bit off the valley,</p>
<p>just like water being pushed a little bit by a rock,</p>
<p>it gets back and follows the course of the river.</p>
<p>And that basically the analog</p>
<p>in the physical system, which enables you to say,</p>
<p>oh yes, error free computation and an associative memory</p>
<p>are very much like things that I can understand</p>
<p>from the point of view of a physical system.</p>
<p>The physical system is, can be under some circumstances,</p>
<p>an accurate metaphor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only metaphor.</p>
<p>There are error correction schemes,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t have a valley and energy behind them.</p>
<p>But those are error correction schemes,</p>
<p>which a mathematician may be able to understand,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the physical metaphor that seems to work here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So these kinds of networks actually led to a lot of the work</p>
<p>that is going on now in neural networks,</p>
<p>artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>So the follow on work with restricted Boltzmann machines</p>
<p>and deep belief nets followed on from these ideas</p>
<p>of the Hopfield network.</p>
<p>So what do you think about this continued progress</p>
<p>of that work towards now re revigorated exploration</p>
<p>of feed forward neural networks</p>
<p>and recurrent neural networks</p>
<p>and convolutional neural networks</p>
<p>and kinds of networks that are helping solve</p>
<p>image recognition, natural language processing,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It always intrigued me that one of the most long lived</p>
<p>of the learning systems is the Boltzmann machine,</p>
<p>which is intrinsically a feedback network.</p>
<p>And with the brilliance of Hind and Sinowski</p>
<p>to understand how to do learning in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still a useful way to understand learning</p>
<p>and the learning that you understand in that</p>
<p>has something to do with the way</p>
<p>that feed forward systems work.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not always exactly simple</p>
<p>to express that intuition.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always amuses me to see Hinton</p>
<p>going back to the will yet again</p>
<p>on a form of the Boltzmann machine</p>
<p>because really that which has feedback</p>
<p>and interesting probabilities in it</p>
<p>is a lovely encapsulation of something in computational.</p>
<p>Something computational?</p>
<p>Something both computational and physical.</p>
<p>Computational and it&rsquo;s very much related</p>
<p>to feed forward networks.</p>
<p>Physical in that Boltzmann machine learning</p>
<p>is really learning a set of parameters</p>
<p>for a physics Hamiltonian or energy function.</p>
<p>What do you think about learning in this whole domain?</p>
<p>Do you think the aforementioned guy,</p>
<p>Jeff Hinton, all the work there with backpropagation,</p>
<p>all the kind of learning that goes on in these networks,</p>
<p>if we compare it to learning in the brain, for example,</p>
<p>is there echoes of the same kind of power</p>
<p>that backpropagation reveals</p>
<p>about these kinds of recurrent networks?</p>
<p>Or is it something fundamentally different</p>
<p>going on in the brain?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the brain is as deep</p>
<p>as the deepest networks go,</p>
<p>the deepest computer science networks.</p>
<p>And I do wonder whether part of that depth</p>
<p>of the computer science networks is necessitated</p>
<p>by the fact that the only learning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easily done on a machine is feed forward.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s the question of to what extent</p>
<p>is the biology, which has some feed forward</p>
<p>and some feed back,</p>
<p>been captured by something which has got many more neurons</p>
<p>but much more depth than the neurons in it.</p>
<p>So part of you wonders if the feedback is actually</p>
<p>more essential than the number of neurons or the depth,</p>
<p>The dynamics of the feedback.</p>
<p>Look, if you don&rsquo;t have feedback,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit like a building a big computer</p>
<p>and running it through one clock cycle.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>until you reload something coming in.</p>
<p>How do you use the fact that there are multiple clock cycles?</p>
<p>How do I use the fact that you can close your eyes,</p>
<p>stop listening to me and think about a chessboard</p>
<p>for two minutes without any input whatsoever?</p>
<p>Yeah, that memory thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamentally a feedback kind of mechanism.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going back to something.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s hard to understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to introspect,</p>
<p>let alone consciousness.</p>
<p>Oh, let alone consciousness, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s tied up in there too.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just put that on another shelf.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I get interested in consciousness</p>
<p>and then I go and I&rsquo;ve done that for years</p>
<p>and ask one of my betters, as it were,</p>
<p>their view on consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting collecting them.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to take a brief step into that room.</p>
<p>Well, ask Marvin Minsky,</p>
<p>his view on consciousness.</p>
<p>And Marvin said,</p>
<p>consciousness is basically overrated.</p>
<p>It may be an epiphenomenon.</p>
<p>After all, all the things your brain does,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually hard computations</p>
<p>you do nonconsciously.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much evidence</p>
<p>that even the simple things you do,</p>
<p>you can make decisions,</p>
<p>you can make committed decisions about them,</p>
<p>the neurobiologist can say,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s now committed, he&rsquo;s going to move the hand left</p>
<p>before you know it.</p>
<p>So his view that consciousness is not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like little icing on the cake.</p>
<p>The real cake is in the subconscious.</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>Subconscious, nonconscious.</p>
<p>Nonconscious, what&rsquo;s the better word, sir?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only that Freud captured the other word.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a confusing word, subconscious.</p>
<p>Nicholas Chaiter wrote an interesting book.</p>
<p>I think the title of it is The Mind is Flat.</p>
<p>Flat in a neural net sense, might be flat</p>
<p>as something which is a very broad neural net</p>
<p>without any layers in depth,</p>
<p>whereas a deep brain would be many layers</p>
<p>and not so broad.</p>
<p>In the same sense that if you push Minsky hard enough,</p>
<p>he would probably have said,</p>
<p>consciousness is your effort to explain to yourself</p>
<p>that which you have already done.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the weaving of the narrative</p>
<p>around the things that have already been computed for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, and so much of what we do</p>
<p>for our memories of events, for example.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s some traumatic event you witness,</p>
<p>you will have a few facts about it correctly done.</p>
<p>If somebody asks you about it, you will weave a narrative</p>
<p>which is actually much more rich in detail than that</p>
<p>based on some anchor points you have of correct things</p>
<p>and pulling together general knowledge on the other,</p>
<p>but you will have a narrative.</p>
<p>And once you generate that narrative,</p>
<p>you are very likely to repeat that narrative</p>
<p>and claim that all the things you have in it</p>
<p>are actually the correct things.</p>
<p>There was a marvelous example of that</p>
<p>in the Watergate slash impeachment era of John Dean.</p>
<p>John Dean, you&rsquo;re too young to know,</p>
<p>had been the personal lawyer of Nixon.</p>
<p>And so John Dean was involved in the coverup</p>
<p>and John Dean ultimately realized</p>
<p>the only way to keep himself out of jail for a long time</p>
<p>was actually to tell some of the truths about Nixon.</p>
<p>And John Dean was a tremendous witness.</p>
<p>He would remember these conversations in great detail</p>
<p>and very convincing detail.</p>
<p>And long afterward, some of the tapes,</p>
<p>the secret tapes as it were from which these,</p>
<p>Don was, Gene was recalling these conversations</p>
<p>were published, and one found out that John Dean</p>
<p>had a good but not exceptional memory.</p>
<p>What he had was an ability to paint vividly</p>
<p>and in some sense accurately the tone of what was going on.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s a beautiful description of consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you, like where do you stand in your today?</p>
<p>So perhaps it changes day to day,</p>
<p>but where do you stand on the importance of consciousness</p>
<p>in our whole big mess of cognition?</p>
<p>Is it just a little narrative maker</p>
<p>or is it actually fundamental to intelligence?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very hard one.</p>
<p>When I asked Francis Crick about consciousness,</p>
<p>he launched forward in a long monologue</p>
<p>about Mendel and the peas and how Mendel knew</p>
<p>that there was something and how biologists understood</p>
<p>that there was something in inheritance,</p>
<p>which was just very, very different.</p>
<p>And the fact that inherited traits didn&rsquo;t just wash out</p>
<p>into a gray, but this or this and propagated</p>
<p>that that was absolutely fundamental to the biology.</p>
<p>And it took generations of biologists to understand</p>
<p>that there was genetics and it took another generation</p>
<p>or two to understand that genetics came from DNA.</p>
<p>But very shortly after Mendel, thinking biologists</p>
<p>did realize that there was a deep problem about inheritance.</p>
<p>And Francis would have liked to have said,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m working on consciousness.</p>
<p>But of course, he didn&rsquo;t have any smoking gun</p>
<p>in the sense of Mendel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the weakness of his position.</p>
<p>If you read his book, which he wrote with Koch, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, Christoph Koch, yeah.</p>
<p>I find it unconvincing for the smoking gun reason.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going on collecting views without actually having taken</p>
<p>a very strong one myself,</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t seen the entry point.</p>
<p>Not seeing the smoking gun from the point of view</p>
<p>of physics, I don&rsquo;t see the entry point.</p>
<p>Whereas in neurobiology, once I understood the idea</p>
<p>of a collective, an evolution of dynamics,</p>
<p>which could be described as a collective phenomenon,</p>
<p>I thought, ah, there&rsquo;s a point where what I know</p>
<p>about physics is so different from any neurobiologist</p>
<p>that I have something that I might be able to contribute.</p>
<p>And right now, there&rsquo;s no way to grasp at consciousness</p>
<p>from a physics perspective.</p>
<p>From my point of view, that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And of course, people, physicists, like everybody else,</p>
<p>think very muddily about things.</p>
<p>You ask the closely related question about free will.</p>
<p>Do you believe you have free will?</p>
<p>Physicists will give an offhand answer,</p>
<p>and then backtrack, backtrack, backtrack,</p>
<p>where they realize that the answer they gave</p>
<p>must fundamentally contradict the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Natural, answering questions of free will</p>
<p>and consciousness naturally lead to contradictions</p>
<p>from a physics perspective.</p>
<p>Because it eventually ends up with quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>and then you get into that whole mess</p>
<p>of trying to understand how much,</p>
<p>from a physics perspective, how much is determined,</p>
<p>already predetermined, how much is already deterministic</p>
<p>about our universe, and there&rsquo;s lots of different things.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t push quite that far, you can say,</p>
<p>essentially, all of neurobiology, which is relevant,</p>
<p>can be captured by classical equations of motion.</p>
<p>Right, because in my view of the mysteries of the brain</p>
<p>are not the mysteries of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>but the mysteries of what can happen</p>
<p>when you have a dynamical system, driven system,</p>
<p>with 10 to the 14 parts.</p>
<p>That that complexity is something which is,</p>
<p>that the physics of complex systems</p>
<p>is at least as badly understood</p>
<p>as the physics of phase coherence in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Can we go there for a second?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about attractor networks,</p>
<p>and just maybe you could say what are attractor networks,</p>
<p>and more broadly, what are interesting network dynamics</p>
<p>that emerge in these or other complex systems?</p>
<p>You have to be willing to think</p>
<p>in a huge number of dimensions,</p>
<p>because in a huge number of dimensions,</p>
<p>the behavior of a system can be thought</p>
<p>as just the motion of a point over time</p>
<p>in this huge number of dimensions.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And an attractor network is simply a network</p>
<p>where there is a line and other lines</p>
<p>converge on it in time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essence of an attractor network.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you.</p>
<p>In a highly dimensional space.</p>
<p>And the easiest way to get that</p>
<p>is to do it in a highly dimensional space,</p>
<p>where some of the dimensions provide the dissipation,</p>
<p>which, if I have a physical system,</p>
<p>trajectories can&rsquo;t contract everywhere.</p>
<p>They have to contract in some places and expand in others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental classical theorem</p>
<p>of statistical mechanics,</p>
<p>which goes under the name of Liouville&rsquo;s theorem,</p>
<p>which says you can&rsquo;t contract everywhere.</p>
<p>If you contract somewhere, you expand somewhere else.</p>
<p>In interesting physical systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got driven systems</p>
<p>where you have a small subsystem,</p>
<p>which is the interesting part.</p>
<p>And the rest of the contraction and expansion,</p>
<p>the physicists would say it&rsquo;s entropy flow</p>
<p>in this other part of the system.</p>
<p>But basically, attractor networks are dynamics</p>
<p>that are funneling down so that you can&rsquo;t be any,</p>
<p>so that if you start somewhere in the dynamical system,</p>
<p>you will soon find yourself</p>
<p>on a pretty well determined pathway, which goes somewhere.</p>
<p>If you start somewhere else,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll wind up on a different pathway,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have just all possible things.</p>
<p>You have some defined pathways which are allowed</p>
<p>and onto which you will converge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way you make a stable computer,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way you make a stable behavior.</p>
<p>So in general, looking at the physics</p>
<p>of the emergent stability in networks,</p>
<p>what are some interesting characteristics that,</p>
<p>what are some interesting insights</p>
<p>from studying the dynamics of such high dimensional systems?</p>
<p>Most dynamical systems, most driven dynamical systems,</p>
<p>are driven, they&rsquo;re coupled somehow to an energy source.</p>
<p>And so their dynamics keeps going</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s coupling to the energy source.</p>
<p>Most of them, it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand at all</p>
<p>what the dynamical behavior is going to be.</p>
<p>You have to run it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a subset of systems which has</p>
<p>what is actually known to the mathematicians</p>
<p>as a Lyapunov function, and those systems,</p>
<p>you can understand convergent dynamics</p>
<p>by saying you&rsquo;re going downhill on something or other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I found with ever knowing</p>
<p>what Lyapunov functions were in the simple model</p>
<p>I made in the early 80s, was an energy function</p>
<p>so you could understand how you could get this channeling</p>
<p>on the pathways without having to follow the dynamics</p>
<p>in infinite detail.</p>
<p>You started rolling a ball at the top of a mountain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna wind up at the bottom of a valley.</p>
<p>You know that&rsquo;s true without actually watching</p>
<p>the ball roll down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain properties of the system</p>
<p>that when you can know that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And not all systems behave that way.</p>
<p>Most don&rsquo;t, probably.</p>
<p>Most don&rsquo;t, but it provides you with a metaphor</p>
<p>for thinking about systems which are stable</p>
<p>and who to have these attractors behave</p>
<p>even if you can&rsquo;t find a Lyapunov function behind them</p>
<p>or an energy function behind them.</p>
<p>It gives you a metaphor for thought.</p>
<p>Yeah, speaking of thought,</p>
<p>if I had a glint in my eye with excitement</p>
<p>and said I&rsquo;m really excited about this something</p>
<p>called deep learning and neural networks</p>
<p>and I would like to create an intelligent system</p>
<p>and came to you as an advisor, what would you recommend?</p>
<p>Is it a hopeless pursuit to use neural networks</p>
<p>to achieve thought?</p>
<p>Is it, what kind of mechanisms should we explore?</p>
<p>What kind of ideas should we explore?</p>
<p>Well, you look at the simple networks,</p>
<p>the one past networks.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t support multiple hypotheses very well.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>As I have tried to work with very simple systems</p>
<p>which do something which you might consider to be thinking,</p>
<p>thought has to do with the ability to do mental exploration</p>
<p>before you take a physical action.</p>
<p>Almost like we were mentioning, playing chess,</p>
<p>visualizing, simulating inside your head different outcomes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And now you would do that in a feed forward network</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve pre calculated all kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I think the way neurobiology does it</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t pre calculated everything.</p>
<p>It actually has parts of a dynamical system</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re doing exploration in a way which is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a creative element.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s an.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a creative element.</p>
<p>And in a simple minded neural net,</p>
<p>you have a constellation of instances</p>
<p>of which you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>And if you are within that space,</p>
<p>if a new question is a question within this space,</p>
<p>you can actually rely on that system pretty well</p>
<p>to come up with a good suggestion for what to do.</p>
<p>If on the other hand,</p>
<p>the query comes from outside the space,</p>
<p>you have no way of knowing how the system</p>
<p>is gonna behave.</p>
<p>There are no limitations on what can happen.</p>
<p>And so with the artificial neural net world</p>
<p>is always very much,</p>
<p>I have a population of examples.</p>
<p>The test set must be drawn from the equivalent population.</p>
<p>If the test set has examples,</p>
<p>which are from a population which is completely different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that you could expect</p>
<p>to get the answer right.</p>
<p>Yeah, what they call outside the distribution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so if you see a ball rolling across the street at dusk,</p>
<p>if that wasn&rsquo;t in your training set,</p>
<p>the idea that a child may be coming close behind that</p>
<p>is not going to occur to the neural net.</p>
<p>And it is to our,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in your biology that allows that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something in the way</p>
<p>of what it means to be outside of the population</p>
<p>of the training set.</p>
<p>The population of the training set</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just sort of this set of examples.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to it than that.</p>
<p>And it gets back to my question of,</p>
<p>what is it to understand something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, in a small tangent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about the value of thinking</p>
<p>of deductive reasoning in science</p>
<p>versus large data collection.</p>
<p>So sort of thinking about the problem.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s the physics side of you</p>
<p>of going back to first principles and thinking,</p>
<p>but what do you think is the value of deductive reasoning</p>
<p>in the scientific process?</p>
<p>Well, there are obviously scientific questions</p>
<p>in which the route to the answer to it</p>
<p>comes through the analysis of one hell of a lot of data.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Cosmology, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s never been the kind of problem</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;ve had any particular insight.</p>
<p>Though I must say, if you look at,</p>
<p>cosmology is one of those.</p>
<p>If you look at the actual things that Jim Peebles,</p>
<p>one of this year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize in physics,</p>
<p>ones from the local physics department,</p>
<p>the kinds of things he&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never crunched large data.</p>
<p>Never, never, never.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s used the encapsulation of the work of others</p>
<p>in this regard.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it ultimately boiled down to thinking</p>
<p>through the problem.</p>
<p>Like what are the principles under which</p>
<p>a particular phenomenon operates?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And look, physics is always going to look</p>
<p>for ways in which you can describe the system</p>
<p>in a way which rises above the details.</p>
<p>And to the hard dyed, the wool biologist,</p>
<p>biology works because of the details.</p>
<p>In physics, to the physicists,</p>
<p>we want an explanation which is right</p>
<p>in spite of the details.</p>
<p>And there will be questions which we cannot answer</p>
<p>as physicists because the answer cannot be found that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with the entire field of brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s become more and more intensely researched</p>
<p>and developed recently, especially with companies</p>
<p>like Neuralink with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know there have always been the interests</p>
<p>both in things like getting the eyes</p>
<p>to be able to control things</p>
<p>or getting the thought patterns</p>
<p>to be able to move what had been a connected limb</p>
<p>which is now connected through a computer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So in the case of Neuralink,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing 1,000 plus connections</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re able to do two way,</p>
<p>activate and read spikes, neural spikes.</p>
<p>Do you have hope for that kind of computer brain interaction</p>
<p>in the near or maybe even far future</p>
<p>of being able to expand the ability</p>
<p>of the mind of cognition or understand the mind?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting watching things go.</p>
<p>When I first became interested in neurobiology,</p>
<p>most of the practitioners thought you would be able</p>
<p>to understand neurobiology by techniques</p>
<p>which allowed you to record only one cell at a time.</p>
<p>One cell, yeah.</p>
<p>People like David Hubel,</p>
<p>very strongly reflected that point of view.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been taken over by a generation,</p>
<p>a couple of generations later,</p>
<p>by a set of people who says not until we can record</p>
<p>from 10 to the four, 10 to the five at a time,</p>
<p>will we actually be able to understand</p>
<p>how the brain actually works.</p>
<p>And in a general sense, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You have to begin to be able to look</p>
<p>for the collective modes, the collective operations of things.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t rely on this action potential or that cell.</p>
<p>It relies on the collective properties of this set of cells</p>
<p>connected with this kind of patterns and so on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to succeed in seeing</p>
<p>what those collective activities are</p>
<p>without recording many cells at once.</p>
<p>The question is how many at once?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the threshold?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, and look, it&rsquo;s being pursued hard</p>
<p>in the motor cortex.</p>
<p>The motor cortex does something which is complex,</p>
<p>and yet the problem you&rsquo;re trying to address</p>
<p>is fairly simple.</p>
<p>Now, neurobiology does it in ways that differ</p>
<p>from the way an engineer would do it.</p>
<p>An engineer would put in six highly accurate stepping motors</p>
<p>are controlling a limb rather than 100,000 muscle fibers,</p>
<p>each of which has to be individually controlled.</p>
<p>And so understanding how to do things in a way</p>
<p>which is much more forgiving and much more neural,</p>
<p>I think would benefit the engineering world.</p>
<p>The engineering world, a touch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put in a pressure sensor or two,</p>
<p>rather than an array of a gazillion pressure sensors,</p>
<p>none of which are accurate,</p>
<p>all of which are perpetually recalibrating themselves.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying your hope is,</p>
<p>your advice for the engineers of the future</p>
<p>is to embrace the large chaos of a messy, air prone system</p>
<p>like those of the biological systems.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s probably the way to solve some of these.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be able to make better computations</p>
<p>slash robotics that way than by trying to force things</p>
<p>into a robotics where joint motors are powerful</p>
<p>and stepping motors are accurate.</p>
<p>But then the physicists, the physicist in you</p>
<p>will be lost forever in such systems</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no simple fundamentals to explore</p>
<p>in systems that are so large and messy.</p>
<p>Well, you say that, and yet there&rsquo;s a lot of physics</p>
<p>in the Navier Stokes equations,</p>
<p>the equations of nonlinear hydrodynamics,</p>
<p>huge amount of physics in them.</p>
<p>All the physics of atoms and molecules has been lost,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been replaced by this other set of equations,</p>
<p>which is just as true as the equations at the bottom.</p>
<p>Now those equations are going to be harder to find</p>
<p>in general biology, but the physicist in me says</p>
<p>there are probably some equations of that sort.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there, and if physics</p>
<p>is going to contribute anything,</p>
<p>it may contribute to trying to find out</p>
<p>what those equations are and how to capture them</p>
<p>from the biology.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s one of the main open problems</p>
<p>of our age is to discover those equations?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at, there&rsquo;s molecules</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s psychological behavior,</p>
<p>and these two are somehow related.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re layers of detail, they&rsquo;re layers of collectiveness,</p>
<p>and to capture that in some vague way,</p>
<p>several stages on the way up to see how these things</p>
<p>can actually be linked together.</p>
<p>So it seems in our universe, there&rsquo;s a lot of elegant</p>
<p>equations that can describe the fundamental way</p>
<p>that things behave, which is a surprise.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s compressible into equations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple and beautiful, but it&rsquo;s still an open question</p>
<p>whether that link is equally between molecules</p>
<p>and the brain is equally compressible</p>
<p>into elegant equations.</p>
<p>But your sense, well, you&rsquo;re both a physicist</p>
<p>and a dreamer, you have a sense that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but I can only dream physics dreams.</p>
<p>Physics dreams.</p>
<p>There was an interesting book called Einstein&rsquo;s Dreams,</p>
<p>which alternates between chapters on his life</p>
<p>and descriptions of the way time might have been but isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The linking between these being important ideas</p>
<p>that Einstein might have had to think about</p>
<p>the essence of time as he was thinking about time.</p>
<p>So speaking of the essence of time in your biology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one human, famous, impactful human,</p>
<p>but just one human with a brain living the human condition.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re ultimately mortal, just like all of us.</p>
<p>Has studying the mind as a mechanism</p>
<p>changed the way you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>It has, really, because particularly as you get older</p>
<p>and the body comes apart in various ways,</p>
<p>I became much more aware of the fact</p>
<p>that what is somebody is contained in the brain</p>
<p>and not in the body that you worry about burying.</p>
<p>And it is to a certain extent true</p>
<p>that for people who write things down,</p>
<p>equations, dreams, notepads, diaries,</p>
<p>fractions of their thought does continue to live</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re dead and gone,</p>
<p>after their body is dead and gone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sea change in that going on in my lifetime</p>
<p>between when my father died, except for the things</p>
<p>which were actually written by him, as it were.</p>
<p>Very few facts about him will have ever been recorded.</p>
<p>And the number of facts which are recorded</p>
<p>about each and every one of us, forever now,</p>
<p>as far as I can see, in the digital world.</p>
<p>And so the whole question of what is death</p>
<p>may be different for people a generation ago</p>
<p>and a generation further ahead.</p>
<p>Maybe we have become immortal under some definitions.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Last easy question, what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Looking back, you&rsquo;ve studied the mind,</p>
<p>us weird descendants of apes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of our existence on this little earth?</p>
<p>Oh, that word meaning is as slippery as the word understand.</p>
<p>Interconnected somehow, perhaps.</p>
<p>Is there, it&rsquo;s slippery, but is there something</p>
<p>that you, despite being slippery,</p>
<p>can hold long enough to express?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been amazed at how hard it is</p>
<p>to define the things in a living system</p>
<p>in the sense that one hydrogen atom</p>
<p>is pretty much like another,</p>
<p>but one bacterium is not so much like another bacterium,</p>
<p>even of the same nominal species.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole notion of what is the species</p>
<p>gets a little bit fuzzy.</p>
<p>And do species exist in the absence</p>
<p>of certain classes of environments?</p>
<p>And pretty soon one winds up with a biology</p>
<p>which the whole thing is living,</p>
<p>but whether there&rsquo;s actually any element of it</p>
<p>which by itself would be said to be living</p>
<p>becomes a little bit vague in my mind.</p>
<p>So in a sense, the idea of meaning</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s possessed by an individual,</p>
<p>like a conscious creature.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s all interconnected</p>
<p>in some kind of way that there might not even</p>
<p>be an individual.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all kind of this complicated mess</p>
<p>of biological systems at all different levels</p>
<p>where the human starts and when the human ends is unclear.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and we&rsquo;re in neurobiology where the,</p>
<p>oh, you say the neocortex is the thinking,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of things that are done on the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And so where&rsquo;s the essence of thought?</p>
<p>Is it just gonna be neocortex?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be, can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe to understand and to build thought</p>
<p>you have to build the universe along with the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all interlinked through the spinal cord.</p>
<p>John, it&rsquo;s a huge honor talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for the challenge of talking with you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether you can win</p>
<p>five minutes out of this with just coherence</p>
<p>to anyone or not.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom</p>
<p>from John Hopfield in his article titled, Now What?</p>
<p>Choosing problems is the primary determinant</p>
<p>of what one accomplishes in science.</p>
<p>I have generally had a relatively short attention span</p>
<p>in science problems.</p>
<p>Thus, I have always been on the lookout</p>
<p>for more interesting questions,</p>
<p>either as my present ones get worked out</p>
<p>or as they get classified by me as intractable,</p>
<p>given my particular talents.</p>
<p>He then goes on to say,</p>
<p>what I have done in science relies entirely</p>
<p>on experimental and theoretical studies by experts.</p>
<p>I have a great respect for them,</p>
<p>especially for those who are willing to attempt</p>
<p>communication with someone who is not an expert in the field.</p>
<p>I would only add that experts are good</p>
<p>at answering questions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re brash enough, ask your own.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about how you found them.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
