    <p>Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.</p>
<p>And if you gaze into the abyss,</p>
<p>the abyss gazes also into you.</p>
<p>But I would say, bring it on.</p>
<p>If you gaze into the abyss long enough,</p>
<p>you see the light, not the darkness.</p>
<p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting my life on it.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host,</p>
<p>and author of Maps of Meaning, 12 Rules for Life,</p>
<p>and Beyond Order.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Readman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot,</p>
<p>spoken through the character of Prince Mishkin,</p>
<p>that beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this in his Nobel Prize</p>
<p>acceptance speech.</p>
<p>What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?</p>
<p>Was he right?</p>
<p>Well, I guess it&rsquo;s the divine that saves the world,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you could say that by definition.</p>
<p>And then you might say, well, are there pointers</p>
<p>to that which will save the world,</p>
<p>or that which eternally saves the world?</p>
<p>And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s maybe truth, and love, and justice,</p>
<p>and the classical virtues, beauty, perhaps,</p>
<p>in some sense, foremost among them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.</p>
<p>Which direction is the arrow pointing?</p>
<p>Well, the arrow&rsquo;s pointing up.</p>
<p>No, I think that that which it points to</p>
<p>is what beauty points to.</p>
<p>It transcends beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than beauty.</p>
<p>And that speaks to the divine.</p>
<p>It points to the divine.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would say, again, by definition,</p>
<p>because we could define the divine in some real sense.</p>
<p>So one way of defining the divine is,</p>
<p>what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, I don&rsquo;t have a fundamental axiom.</p>
<p>And I would say, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re just confused,</p>
<p>because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say, well, you&rsquo;re just epistemologically</p>
<p>ignorant beyond comprehension, if you think that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just not true at all.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think a human being can exist</p>
<p>within contradictions?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction.</p>
<p>But when the contradictions make themselves manifest,</p>
<p>say in confusion with regard to direction,</p>
<p>then the consequence of that technically is anxiety,</p>
<p>and frustration, and disappointment,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other negative emotions.</p>
<p>But the cardinal negative emotion,</p>
<p>signifying multiple pathways forward, is anxiety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entropy signal.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think that kind of entropy signal</p>
<p>can be channeled into beauty, into love?</p>
<p>Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?</p>
<p>Well, I would say it probably doesn&rsquo;t have to be,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be reduced to clarity and simplicity.</p>
<p>Because when it&rsquo;s optimally structured,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too ordered, if music is too ordered,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not acceptable.</p>
<p>It sounds like a drum machine, it&rsquo;s too repetitive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too predictable.</p>
<p>It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it,</p>
<p>along with the structure.</p>
<p>I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus</p>
<p>with a number of scholars, and this is a beauty discussion.</p>
<p>When Moses first encounters the burning bush,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a conflagration that demands attention,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that catches his attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phenomena, and that means to shine forth.</p>
<p>And Moses has to stop and attend to it, and he does.</p>
<p>And he sees this fire that doesn&rsquo;t consume the tree.</p>
<p>And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tree like structure, it&rsquo;s a branching structure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a self similar structure, it&rsquo;s a fractal structure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the tree of life,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>And the fire in it is the transformation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always occurring within every structure.</p>
<p>And the fact that the fire doesn&rsquo;t consume the bush</p>
<p>in that representation is an indication</p>
<p>of the balance of transformation with structure.</p>
<p>And that balance is presented as God,</p>
<p>and what attracts Moses to it in some sense is the beauty.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the novelty and all that,</p>
<p>but like a painting is like a burning bush,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much for people often.</p>
<p>My house was, and will soon be again,</p>
<p>completely covered with paintings inside.</p>
<p>And it was hard on people to come in there</p>
<p>because, well, my mother, for example, say,</p>
<p>well, why would you wanna live in a museum?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d think, well, I would rather live in a museum</p>
<p>than anywhere else in some real sense,</p>
<p>but beauty is daunting, it scares people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re terrified of buying art, for example,</p>
<p>because their taste is on display,</p>
<p>and they should be terrified</p>
<p>because generally people have terrible taste.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they shouldn&rsquo;t foster it</p>
<p>and develop it, but, and you know,</p>
<p>when you put your taste on display,</p>
<p>it really exposes you.</p>
<p>Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.</p>
<p>Absolutely. This is who I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is,</p>
<p>and look how trite it is, and look at how cliched it is,</p>
<p>and look at how sterile or too ordered it is, or too chaotic.</p>
<p>Or how quickly you start to take it for granted</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve seen it so many times.</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s a real piece of art, that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>You notice the little details.</p>
<p>The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>I mean, there are images, religious images in particular,</p>
<p>so we could call them deep images,</p>
<p>that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years</p>
<p>and still haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>This is a terrible example.</p>
<p>So, I did a lecture series on Genesis,</p>
<p>and I got a lot of it unpacked, but by no means all of it.</p>
<p>When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,</p>
<p>he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate</p>
<p>to stop human beings from reentering paradise.</p>
<p>I thought, what the hell does that mean, cherubim,</p>
<p>and why do they have flaming swords?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get that. What is that exactly?</p>
<p>And then I found out from Matthew Pagel,</p>
<p>who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,</p>
<p>that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complicated idea,</p>
<p>and that they are partly a representation of that</p>
<p>which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also got an angelic or demonic aspect.</p>
<p>Take your pick.</p>
<p>Why do they have flaming swords?</p>
<p>Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment and the separation</p>
<p>of the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>You use a sword to cut away, to cut away, and to carve.</p>
<p>And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that which burns.</p>
<p>And what does it carve away and burn?</p>
<p>Well, you want to get into paradise?</p>
<p>It carves away everything about you that isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>And so what does that mean?</p>
<p>Okay, well, here&rsquo;s part of what it means.</p>
<p>This is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>So you could say that the entire Christian narrative</p>
<p>is embedded in that image.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.</p>
<p>That seems pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say further that they&rsquo;re a symbol of apocalypse and hell.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>Not only do you have to face death,</p>
<p>you have to face death and hell before you can get to paradise.</p>
<p>Hellish judgment and all that&rsquo;s embedded in that image.</p>
<p>And a piece of art with an image like that</p>
<p>has all that information in it.</p>
<p>And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.</p>
<p>It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind</p>
<p>at levels you can&rsquo;t even comprehend and grips you.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why people go to museums and gaze at paintings</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ll pay what&rsquo;s the most expensive objects</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not carbon fiber racing yachts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely classic paintings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high level technological implements or it&rsquo;s classic art.</p>
<p>Well, why are those things so expensive?</p>
<p>Why do we build temples to house the images?</p>
<p>Even secular people go to museums.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m secular.</p>
<p>Well, are you in a museum?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you looking at art?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, what makes you think you&rsquo;re secular then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arguable that the thing many, many centuries from now</p>
<p>that will remain of all of human civilization will be our art.</p>
<p>Not even the words.</p>
<p>Well, a book has remained a very long time, right?</p>
<p>The biblical writings have.</p>
<p>Not that long.</p>
<p>A few millennia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s in the full arc of living organisms,</p>
<p>perhaps will not be.</p>
<p>Well, we have images that are, we</p>
<p>have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old,</p>
<p>right, that have survived.</p>
<p>And some of those are, they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>profound in their symbolism.</p>
<p>By we, do you mean humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, we found them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve lasted, they&rsquo;ve lasted that long.</p>
<p>And so, and then think about Europe.</p>
<p>Secular people all over the world</p>
<p>make pilgrimages to Europe.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>Because of the beauty.</p>
<p>Obviously, I mean, that&rsquo;s self evident.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s partly because there are things</p>
<p>in Europe that are so beautiful.</p>
<p>They take your breath away, right?</p>
<p>They make your hair stand on end.</p>
<p>They fill you with a sense of awe.</p>
<p>And we need to see those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not optional.</p>
<p>We need to see those things.</p>
<p>The cathedrals.</p>
<p>I was in a cathedral in Vienna, and it was terribly beautiful.</p>
<p>Terribly beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, it was terribly beautiful.</p>
<p>Is beauty painful for you?</p>
<p>Is that the highest form of beauty?</p>
<p>It really challenges you?</p>
<p>Oh, definitely.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I got a good analysis of the statue of David.</p>
<p>Michelangelo says, you could be far more than you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that statue says.</p>
<p>And this cathedral, we went down into the under structure of it.</p>
<p>And there were three floors of bones from the plague.</p>
<p>And there they all are.</p>
<p>And then that cathedral is on top of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no joke to go visit a place like that.</p>
<p>No, it rattles you to the core.</p>
<p>And our religious systems have become propositionally dubious.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no arguing with the architecture,</p>
<p>although modern architects like to,</p>
<p>with their sterility and their giant middle fingers erected</p>
<p>everywhere.</p>
<p>But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.</p>
<p>And a secular person will say, well, I don&rsquo;t believe in God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, have it your way.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon</p>
<p>of the future except on faith.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, I have no faith.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, good luck with the future then.</p>
<p>Because what are you then, nihilistic and hopeless</p>
<p>and anxiety ridden?</p>
<p>And if not, well, something&rsquo;s guiding you forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s faith in something or multiple things,</p>
<p>which just makes you a polytheist,</p>
<p>which I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you one short lived biological meat</p>
<p>bag to another.</p>
<p>Who is God then?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to sneak up to this question</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s at all possible.</p>
<p>Is it possible to even talk about this?</p>
<p>Well, it better be.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, there&rsquo;s no communicating about it.</p>
<p>It has to be something that can be brought down to Earth.</p>
<p>Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just ignorant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sinful because there&rsquo;s not knowing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s wanting to know or refusing to know.</p>
<p>And so you might say, well, could you</p>
<p>extract God from a description of the objective world?</p>
<p>Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?</p>
<p>And I would say, well, in a sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some truth in that, but not exactly.</p>
<p>Because God in the highest sense is the spirit</p>
<p>that you must emulate in order to thrive.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for a biological definition?</p>
<p>Spirit is a pattern, the spirit that you must</p>
<p>emulate in order to thrive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of, in one sense, when we say the human spirit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an animating principle.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a meta.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pattern.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, what&rsquo;s the pattern?</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you that to some degree.</p>
<p>Imagine that like your grip by beauty,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gripped by admiration.</p>
<p>And you can just notice this.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t propositional.</p>
<p>You have to notice it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, turns out I admire that person.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what admiration means.</p>
<p>It means there&rsquo;s something about the way</p>
<p>they are that compels imitation, another instinct,</p>
<p>or inspires respect or awe even.</p>
<p>What is that that grips you?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say, OK, fine.</p>
<p>But it grips you.</p>
<p>And you want to be like that.</p>
<p>Kids hero worship, for example.</p>
<p>So do adults, for that matter, unless they</p>
<p>become entirely cynical.</p>
<p>I worship quite a few heroes.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>Yes, well, there you go.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, that worship, that celebration and proclivity</p>
<p>to imitate is worship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what worship means most fundamentally.</p>
<p>Now, imagine you took the set of all admirable people</p>
<p>and you extracted out AI learning.</p>
<p>You extracted out the central features</p>
<p>of what constitutes admirable.</p>
<p>And then you did that repeatedly until you purified it</p>
<p>to what was most admirable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as good as you&rsquo;re going to get in terms</p>
<p>of a representation of God.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, I don&rsquo;t believe in that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a set of propositional facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a scientific theory about the structure</p>
<p>of the objective world.</p>
<p>And then I could say something about that, too,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot,</p>
<p>especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, OK, the postmodernist types,</p>
<p>going back way before Derrida and Foucault,</p>
<p>maybe back to Nietzsche, who I admire greatly, by the way.</p>
<p>He says, God is dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, OK.</p>
<p>But Nietzsche said, God is dead, and we have killed him,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll not find enough water to wash away all the blood.</p>
<p>So that was Nietzsche.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s no fool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got away with words.</p>
<p>He certainly does.</p>
<p>And so then you think, OK, well, we killed the transcendent.</p>
<p>Well, what does that mean for science?</p>
<p>Well, it frees it up, because all that nonsense about a deity</p>
<p>is just the idiot superstition that</p>
<p>stops the scientific process from moving forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the new atheist claim, something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wait a second.</p>
<p>Do you believe in the transcendent</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a scientist?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,</p>
<p>you believe in it more than anything else.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a scientist, you</p>
<p>believe in what objects to your theory</p>
<p>more than you believe in your theory.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve got to think that through very carefully.</p>
<p>So your theory describes the world.</p>
<p>And as far as you&rsquo;re concerned, your description of the world</p>
<p>is the world.</p>
<p>But because you&rsquo;re a scientist, you think, well,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s my description of the world</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I believe, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something beyond what I believe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the object.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to throw my theory against the object</p>
<p>and see where it&rsquo;ll break.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to use the evidence of the break</p>
<p>as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.</p>
<p>So as a scientist, you have to posit</p>
<p>the existence of the ontological transcendent</p>
<p>before you can move forward at all.</p>
<p>But more, you have to posit that contact</p>
<p>with the ontological transcendent,</p>
<p>annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart,</p>
<p>is exactly what will, in fact, set you free.</p>
<p>So then you accept the proposition</p>
<p>that there is a transcendent reality</p>
<p>and that contact with that transcendent reality</p>
<p>is redemptive in the most fundamental sense.</p>
<p>Because if it wasn&rsquo;t, well, why would you</p>
<p>bother making contact with it?</p>
<p>Is it going to make everything worse or better?</p>
<p>Why does the contact with the transcendent</p>
<p>set you free as a scientist?</p>
<p>Because you assume that, you assume,</p>
<p>I mean, freedom in the most fundamental sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, freedom from want,</p>
<p>freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?</p>
<p>That it informs you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the lie of science.</p>
<p>It is definitely that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the direction, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>the directionality of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.</p>
<p>And then the question is, what is the narrative?</p>
<p>Well, it posits a transcendent reality.</p>
<p>It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.</p>
<p>It posits that our knowledge structures</p>
<p>should be regarded with humility.</p>
<p>It posits that you should bow down</p>
<p>in the face of the transcendent evidence.</p>
<p>And you have to take a vow.</p>
<p>You know this as a scientist.</p>
<p>You have to take a vow to follow that path if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be a real scientist.</p>
<p>Like, the truth, no matter what, and that</p>
<p>means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.</p>
<p>Well, what does redemptive mean?</p>
<p>Well, why bother with science?</p>
<p>Well, so people don&rsquo;t starve.</p>
<p>So people can move about more effectively.</p>
<p>So life can be more abundant, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all ensconced within an underlying ethic.</p>
<p>So the reason I was saying that while we were talking</p>
<p>about belief in God, it&rsquo;s like, this</p>
<p>is a very complicated topic, right?</p>
<p>Do you believe in a transcendent reality?</p>
<p>See, OK, now let&rsquo;s say you buy the argument I just</p>
<p>made on the natural front.</p>
<p>You say, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s just nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not God.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say, well, what makes you think</p>
<p>you know what nature is?</p>
<p>Like, see, the problem with that argument</p>
<p>is that it already presumes a materialist,</p>
<p>a reductionist, materialist, objective view</p>
<p>of what constitutes nature.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a scientist, you&rsquo;re going to think,</p>
<p>well, in the final analysis, I don&rsquo;t know what nature is.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t know its origin or destination point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know its teleology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really ignorant about nature.</p>
<p>And so when I say it&rsquo;s nothing but nature,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s nothing but what</p>
<p>I understand nature to be.</p>
<p>So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account</p>
<p>of cognitive processes?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>But by the time we do that, our understanding of matter</p>
<p>will have transformed so much that what</p>
<p>we think of as reductionists now won&rsquo;t look anything like what</p>
<p>we think of reductionism now.</p>
<p>Matter isn&rsquo;t dead dust.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>I have no idea what it is.</p>
<p>Matter is what matters.</p>
<p>There is a definition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very weird definition.</p>
<p>But the notion that we have, you know,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re a reductionist, a materialist reductionist,</p>
<p>that you can reduce the complexity of what</p>
<p>is to your assumptions about the nature of matter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a scientific proposition.</p>
<p>Your specific limited human assumptions of this century,</p>
<p>of this week, that so in some sense,</p>
<p>without God in this complicated big definition</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about, there&rsquo;s no humility.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s less likely to be, or rather science</p>
<p>can err in taking a trajectory away from humility.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Without something much more powerful</p>
<p>than an individual human.</p>
<p>Yeah, well then and we know, you know,</p>
<p>the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good story for the current times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re playing around with making new life.</p>
<p>You bloody well better make sure you have your arrows pointed up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because you said science has an ethic to it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s embedded in an ethic.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a, you know, science is a big word.</p>
<p>And it includes a lot of disciplines</p>
<p>that have different traditions.</p>
<p>So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,</p>
<p>those are very different communities.</p>
<p>And I think biology, especially when</p>
<p>you get closer and closer to medicine and to the human body,</p>
<p>does have a very serious, first of all,</p>
<p>has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it has a history of taking this stuff seriously.</p>
<p>What doesn&rsquo;t have a history of taking this stuff seriously</p>
<p>is robotics and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t, you know, you called me a scientist.</p>
<p>And I would like to wear that label proudly,</p>
<p>but often people don&rsquo;t think of computer science as a science.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it will be, I think,</p>
<p>the science of one of the major scientific fields</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>And you should take that very seriously.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,</p>
<p>they think of them as toys to tinker with.</p>
<p>Oh, isn&rsquo;t this cool?</p>
<p>And I feel this too.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this cool?</p>
<p>It is cool.</p>
<p>But, you know, at a certain moment you might,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this nuclear explosion cool?</p>
<p>Because it is.</p>
<p>Or birth control pill cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, or transistor cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the other thing too, and this is a weird problem</p>
<p>in some sense, the robotics engineer types,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thing people, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the big classes of interest</p>
<p>are interest in things versus interest in people.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are thing people.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And thing people are very, very clear, logical thinkers.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very outcome oriented and practical.</p>
<p>Now, and that&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a human side of the equation.</p>
<p>And you get the extreme thing people,</p>
<p>and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re talking about, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking about the necessity of having</p>
<p>a technological enterprise embedded in an ethic.</p>
<p>And you can ignore that, like most of the time, right?</p>
<p>You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re toying around with your toys.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re building an artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s not a toy.</p>
<p>That might be.</p>
<p>Toy becomes the monster very quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And this is a whole new kind of monster.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s already here.</p>
<p>Yes, and you notice how many of those things</p>
<p>you can no longer turn off.</p>
<p>And what is it with you engineers and your inability</p>
<p>to put off switches on things now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I have to hold this for five seconds for it</p>
<p>to shut off.</p>
<p>Or I can&rsquo;t figure it.</p>
<p>I just want to shut it off.</p>
<p>Click, off.</p>
<p>Well, what is it with you humans that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put off switches on other humans?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a magic to the thing that you notice.</p>
<p>And it hurts for both you and perhaps one day the thing</p>
<p>itself to turn it off.</p>
<p>And so you have to be very careful as an engineer</p>
<p>adding off switches to things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug, the off switch.</p>
<p>The off switch gives a deadline to us humans,</p>
<p>to systems of existence.</p>
<p>It makes you, you know, death is the thing that really</p>
<p>brings clarity to life.</p>
<p>And I do think.</p>
<p>Hence the flaming swords.</p>
<p>The flaming sword.</p>
<p>I do like your view of the flame, the bush,</p>
<p>and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a transformation that kind of consumes</p>
<p>the thing in the process.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.</p>
<p>You know, this is why you can&rsquo;t touch the Ark of the Covenant,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re 95% dead wood</p>
<p>and you get too close to the flame,</p>
<p>the 5% that&rsquo;s left might not be able to make it.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s all chaff.</p>
<p>But I think there is some aspect of destruction</p>
<p>that is the old Bukowski line of do what you love</p>
<p>and let it kill you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that destruction is part of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s humility.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like invite in the judgment.</p>
<p>Invite in the judgment because maybe you</p>
<p>can die a little bit instead of dying completely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Alfred North Whitehead.</p>
<p>We can let our ideas die instead of us.</p>
<p>We can have these partial personalities</p>
<p>that we can burn off.</p>
<p>And we can let them go before they become tyrannical pharaohs</p>
<p>and we lose everything.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, there&rsquo;s this optimal bite of death.</p>
<p>And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?</p>
<p>Like what if it was possible that if you died enough</p>
<p>all the time that you could continue to live?</p>
<p>And the thing is we already know that biologically</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t die properly all the time,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s cancerous outgrowths and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very fine balance between productivity</p>
<p>on the biological front and the culling of that, right?</p>
<p>Life is a real balance between growth and death.</p>
<p>And so what would happen if you got that balance right?</p>
<p>Well, we kind of know, right?</p>
<p>Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re humble enough to let your stupidity die</p>
<p>before it takes you out, you will live longer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>Well, but then what&rsquo;s the ultimate extension of that?</p>
<p>And the answer is we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a difficult question because.</p>
<p>As opposed to the easy ones that you&rsquo;ve been asking so far.</p>
<p>Well, Dostoevsky is always just a warm up.</p>
<p>So if death every single day is the way</p>
<p>to progress through life, you have become quite famous.</p>
<p>Death and hell.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t want to forget the hell part.</p>
<p>Do you worry that your fame traps you into the person</p>
<p>that you were before?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Elvis became an Elvis impersonator</p>
<p>by the time he died.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you fear that you have become a Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>impersonator?</p>
<p>Do you fear of, in some part, becoming the famous suit</p>
<p>wearing brilliant Jordan Peterson, the certainty in the pursuit</p>
<p>of truth, always right?</p>
<p>I think I worry about it more than anything else.</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
<p>I hope I do.</p>
<p>I better.</p>
<p>Has fame, to some degree, when you look at yourself</p>
<p>in the mirror, in the quiet of your mind, has it corrupted you?</p>
<p>No doubt, in some regard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing</p>
<p>to avoid because things change around you.</p>
<p>People are much more likely to do what you ask, for example.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a danger because one</p>
<p>of the things that keeps you dying properly</p>
<p>is that people push back against you optimally.</p>
<p>This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,</p>
<p>especially the tyrannical types that, say, run countries.</p>
<p>Everyone around them stops saying,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re deviating a little bit there.</p>
<p>They laugh at all their jokes.</p>
<p>They open all their doors.</p>
<p>They always want something from them.</p>
<p>The red carpet&rsquo;s always rolled out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you think, wouldn&rsquo;t that be lovely?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on your way to perdition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good deal.</p>
<p>You just get there more efficiently.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that I&rsquo;ve tried to learn to manage</p>
<p>is to have people around me all the time who are critics, who</p>
<p>are saying, yeah, I could have done that better.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a little too harsh there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re alienating people unnecessarily there.</p>
<p>And you should have done some more background work there.</p>
<p>And I think the responsibility attendant upon that</p>
<p>increases as your influence increases.</p>
<p>And as your influence increases, then that</p>
<p>becomes a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>So and then maybe have an off day.</p>
<p>And well, here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing some columns lately</p>
<p>about things that perturb me, like the forthcoming famine,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to take those problems on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to take those problems on in a serious</p>
<p>manner, and it&rsquo;s frightening.</p>
<p>And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage</p>
<p>with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy</p>
<p>to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.</p>
<p>But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental</p>
<p>in my tone when I&rsquo;m reading such things, for example,</p>
<p>on YouTube than might be optimal.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve had debates with people about that</p>
<p>because I have friends who say, no,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re calling out the environmentalists, globalists</p>
<p>who are harassing the Dutch farmers,</p>
<p>then a little anger is just the ticket.</p>
<p>But then others say, well, you don&rsquo;t want to be too harsh</p>
<p>because you alienate people who would otherwise listen to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a hard balance to get right.</p>
<p>But also maybe anger hardens your mind</p>
<p>to where you don&rsquo;t notice the subtle quiet beauty</p>
<p>of the world, the quiet love that&rsquo;s always there</p>
<p>that permeates everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the Nietzsche thing.</p>
<p>Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster.</p>
<p>And if you gaze into the abyss,</p>
<p>the abyss gazes also into you.</p>
<p>But I would say, bring it on.</p>
<p>Right, because I also say knowing</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>But if you gaze into the abyss long enough,</p>
<p>you see the light, not the darkness.</p>
<p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting my life on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a heck of a bet.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Because it might distort your mind to where all you see.</p>
<p>Is abyss.</p>
<p>Is abyss, is the evil in this world.</p>
<p>Well, then I would say you haven&rsquo;t looked long enough.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s back to the.</p>
<p>You just eliminated.</p>
<p>The swords, the flaming swords.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, so I said the whole story of Christ</p>
<p>was prefigured in that image.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the story of Christ psychologically</p>
<p>is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it means, that&rsquo;s what the crucifix means.</p>
<p>Psychologically, it&rsquo;s like gaze upon that</p>
<p>which you are most afraid of.</p>
<p>But that story doesn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>Because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.</p>
<p>So death isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>The abyss, the abyss of innocent death</p>
<p>is not sufficient to produce redemption.</p>
<p>It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s true for everyone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, there is no more terrifying idea than that,</p>
<p>by definition.</p>
<p>And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?</p>
<p>Well, who knows?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>How often do you gaze upon death, your own?</p>
<p>How often do you remember, remind yourself</p>
<p>that this ride ends?</p>
<p>Personally?</p>
<p>Personally.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to start philosophizing</p>
<p>and forgetting that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you might die today.</p>
<p>The angel of death sits on every word.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>How often do you actually consciously?</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Notice the angel?</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the things that made me peculiar.</p>
<p>When I was in graduate school, you know,</p>
<p>I thought about, I was, I had the thought of death</p>
<p>in my mind all the time.</p>
<p>And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,</p>
<p>these were people I admired, fine.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t part of their character,</p>
<p>but it was definitely part of mine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wake up every morning, this happened for years,</p>
<p>think, time&rsquo;s short, get at it.</p>
<p>Time&rsquo;s short, get at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things to do.</p>
<p>And so that was always, it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still there with, I would say,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unbearable in some sense.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s your relationship?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I was ready to die a year ago and not casually.</p>
<p>I had people I loved, you know.</p>
<p>So no, I&rsquo;m not very worried about me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very worried about making a mistake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>It was really a striking moment.</p>
<p>Someone asked him about death and he said just offhand</p>
<p>and then went on with the conversation.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;d be a relief.</p>
<p>And then he went on with the conversation.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a lot of weight on his shoulders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that part of him thinks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be easier just if this wasn&rsquo;t here at all.</p>
<p>Now he said it offhand,</p>
<p>but it was a telling moment in my estimation.</p>
<p>So for him, that&rsquo;s a why live question.</p>
<p>The exhaustion of life, if you call it life is suffering,</p>
<p>but the hardship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more afraid of hell than death.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid of the thing that follows?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it follows or if it&rsquo;s always here.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re gonna find out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between death and hell?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to die terribly</p>
<p>if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one connection.</p>
<p>And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the definition, by the way.</p>
<p>What do you make of Elon Musk?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about him a bit.</p>
<p>You met him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struck with admiration.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I make of him.</p>
<p>And I always think of that as a primary.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like, do you find this comedian funny?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I laugh at him.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not propositional again.</p>
<p>And so I would,</p>
<p>there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk about.</p>
<p>The Mars venture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s up to there.</p>
<p>It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense</p>
<p>because I think, well, it&rsquo;d be easier</p>
<p>just to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.</p>
<p>Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what it needs to say.</p>
<p>Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.</p>
<p>Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously he&rsquo;s building rockets.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s motivated because he wants to build</p>
<p>a platform for life on Mars.</p>
<p>Is that a good idea?</p>
<p>Who am I to say?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s building the rockets, man.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to ask him about it.</p>
<p>I would like to see that conversation.</p>
<p>I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,</p>
<p>I think these, several of his ideas like Mars,</p>
<p>like humans becoming a multi planetary species</p>
<p>could be one of the things that human civilization</p>
<p>looks back at as, duh, I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>he is one of the few people that was really pushing</p>
<p>this idea because it&rsquo;s the obvious thing</p>
<p>for society, for life to survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it isn&rsquo;t obvious to me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Like I would like to talk to him</p>
<p>and find out what he&rsquo;s up to and why,</p>
<p>but I mean, he&rsquo;s an impossible person.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s done is impossible, all of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he built an electric car that works.</p>
<p>Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars</p>
<p>or should it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but if we&rsquo;re gonna build electric cars,</p>
<p>he seems to be the best at that by a lot.</p>
<p>And he more or less did that, people carp about him,</p>
<p>but he more or less did that by himself.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s very good at distributing responsibility</p>
<p>and all of that, but he&rsquo;s the spearhead.</p>
<p>And then that was pretty hard.</p>
<p>And then he built a rocket at like one 10th</p>
<p>the price of NASA rockets.</p>
<p>And then he shot his car out into space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty hard.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s building this boring company,</p>
<p>more or less as a, what would you call it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s this whimsical joke in some sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And Neuralink delving into the depths of the mind.</p>
<p>And Starlink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, go Elon, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>And then he puts his finger on things so oddly.</p>
<p>The problem is underpopulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think so too.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a terrible problem that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the West for example, is no longer at replacement</p>
<p>with regard to birth rate.</p>
<p>It means we&rsquo;ve abandoned the Virgin and the child</p>
<p>in a most fundamental sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bloody catastrophe.</p>
<p>And Musk, he sees it clear as can be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, and where everyone else is running around</p>
<p>going, oh, there&rsquo;s too many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, nope, got that.</p>
<p>Not only, see, I&rsquo;ve learned that there are falsehoods</p>
<p>and lies and there are antitruths.</p>
<p>And an antitruth is something that&rsquo;s so preposterous</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t make a claim</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more opposite to the truth.</p>
<p>And the claim that there are too many people</p>
<p>on the planet is an antitruth.</p>
<p>So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept</p>
<p>limits to growth and et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I have to accept the limits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to impose on me</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re frightened of the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your theory, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>It could be a right idea.</p>
<p>It could be a wrong idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think antitruth.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll tell you why it&rsquo;s the wrong idea, I think.</p>
<p>So imagine that there&rsquo;s an emergency, dragon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dragon.</p>
<p>Someone comes and says, there&rsquo;s a dragon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy to deal with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the environmentalists say,</p>
<p>the radical types who push limits to growth.</p>
<p>Then I look at them and I think, okay,</p>
<p>is that dragon real or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one question.</p>
<p>Well, is the&hellip;</p>
<p>I ask that question of myself every time</p>
<p>when I spend time alone.</p>
<p>Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?</p>
<p>Yes or no? I&rsquo;ll just leave that aside for the time being.</p>
<p>I think you can make a case both ways</p>
<p>for a bunch of different reasons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a trivial concern.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve overfished the oceans terribly.</p>
<p>And there are environmental issues that are looming large.</p>
<p>Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not</p>
<p>is a whole different question, but we won&rsquo;t get into that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the issue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clamoring about a dragon.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why should I listen to you?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see how you&rsquo;re reacting to the dragon.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re scared stiff and in a state of panic.</p>
<p>That might indicate you&rsquo;re not the man for the job.</p>
<p>Second, you&rsquo;re willing to use compulsion</p>
<p>to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.</p>
<p>So now not only are you terrified,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a terrified tyrant.</p>
<p>So then I would say, well, then you&rsquo;re not the Moses</p>
<p>that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s a neurological explanation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re so afraid of what you&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re terrified into paralysis and nihilism</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re willing to use tyrannical compulsion</p>
<p>to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.</p>
<p>So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomborg</p>
<p>or Matt Ridley or Marion Toopy.</p>
<p>And they say, well, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got our environmental problems.</p>
<p>And maybe you could make a case</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a Malthusian element in some situations,</p>
<p>but fundamentally the track record of the human race</p>
<p>is that we learn very fast and faster all the time</p>
<p>to do more with less, and we&rsquo;ve got this.</p>
<p>And I think, yes, to that idea.</p>
<p>And I think about it in a fundamental way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I trust Lomborg, I trust Toopy,</p>
<p>trust Matt Ridley.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve thought about these things deeply.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just saying,</p>
<p>oh, the environment doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>whatever the environment is.</p>
<p>You know, the environment, I don&rsquo;t even know what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s everything, the environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about the environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, which is, how is that different</p>
<p>than saying I&rsquo;m worried about everything?</p>
<p>How are those statements different semantically?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the environment, it could be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about human society.</p>
<p>A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much involved for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, everything.</p>
<p>And then these models,</p>
<p>because people have gone after me</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t buy the climate models.</p>
<p>Well, I think about the climate models</p>
<p>as extended into the economic models</p>
<p>because the climate model is,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s gonna be a certain degree of heating,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say by 2100.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, some of that might be human generated.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s a consequence of warming after the ice age.</p>
<p>This has happened before, but fair enough.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take your presumption.</p>
<p>Although there are multiple presumptions</p>
<p>and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,</p>
<p>but have it your way.</p>
<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re gonna extend the climate model,</p>
<p>so to speak, into the economic model.</p>
<p>So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,</p>
<p>third biggest company in the US,</p>
<p>300,000 employees, major league consultants.</p>
<p>They just produced a report in May.</p>
<p>I wrote an article for it in the Telegraph,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m gonna release this week on my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Said, well, if we get the climate problem</p>
<p>under control economically,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the models are now being generated</p>
<p>on the economic front.</p>
<p>So now we have to model the environment, that&rsquo;s climate,</p>
<p>and we have to model the economy,</p>
<p>and then we have to model their joint interaction,</p>
<p>and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,</p>
<p>and then we have to put a dollar value on that,</p>
<p>and then we have to claim that we can do that,</p>
<p>which we can&rsquo;t, and then this is our conclusion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go through a difficult period of privation,</p>
<p>because if we don&rsquo;t accept limits to growth,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a catastrophe,</p>
<p>50 years in the future or thereabouts.</p>
<p>And so to avert that catastrophe,</p>
<p>we are going to make people poorer now.</p>
<p>How much poorer?</p>
<p>Well, not a lot compared to how much richer</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be, but definitely,</p>
<p>and they say this in their own models,</p>
<p>definitely poorer, definitely poorer</p>
<p>than they would be if we just left them the hell alone.</p>
<p>And so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s look at it biologically.</p>
<p>Got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hierarchy or one type.</p>
<p>You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s birds in an environment,</p>
<p>and an avian flu comes in,</p>
<p>and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy,</p>
<p>and the low ranking birds have the worst nests.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re most exposed to wind and rain and sun</p>
<p>and farthest from food supplies</p>
<p>and most exposed to predators.</p>
<p>And so those birds are stressed,</p>
<p>which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more stressed because your life is more uncertain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more stressed.</p>
<p>Your immunological function is compromised</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sacrificing the future for the present.</p>
<p>An avian flu comes in,</p>
<p>and the birds die from the bottom up.</p>
<p>That happens in every epidemic.</p>
<p>You die from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Okay, so they say when the aristocracy catches a cold,</p>
<p>the working class dies of pneumonia.</p>
<p>All right, so now we&rsquo;re gonna make people poorer.</p>
<p>Okay, who?</p>
<p>Well, we know who we make poor when we make people poorer.</p>
<p>We make those who are barely hanging on poorer.</p>
<p>And what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means they die.</p>
<p>And so what the Deloitte consultants are basically saying</p>
<p>is, well, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of unfortunate,</p>
<p>but according to our models,</p>
<p>a lot of poor people are gonna have to die</p>
<p>so that a lot more poor people don&rsquo;t die in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, hold on a sec.</p>
<p>Which of those two things am I supposed to regard</p>
<p>with certainty?</p>
<p>The hypothetical poor people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna hypothetically save 100 years from now,</p>
<p>or the actual poor people</p>
<p>that you are actually going to kill in the next 10 years?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna cast my lot with the actual poor people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually going to kill.</p>
<p>And so, and then I think further,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,</p>
<p>have you actually modeled the world?</p>
<p>Or is this a big advertising shtick</p>
<p>designed to attract your corporate clients</p>
<p>with demonstration that you&rsquo;re so intelligent</p>
<p>that you can actually model the entire ecosystem</p>
<p>of the world, including the economic system,</p>
<p>and predict it 100 years forward?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t there a bit of a moral hazard</p>
<p>in making a claim like that?</p>
<p>Just like just a trifle, especially when&hellip;</p>
<p>So I talked to Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Yon last week.</p>
<p>I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year.</p>
<p>150 million people will suffer food insecurity.</p>
<p>Food insecurity.</p>
<p>Yeah, food insecurity, that&rsquo;s the bloody buzzword.</p>
<p>Famine.</p>
<p>Well, Michael Yon thought 1.2 billion,</p>
<p>and then that it&rsquo;ll spiral because he said,</p>
<p>what happens in a famine is that the governments go nuts,</p>
<p>crazy, the governments destabilize,</p>
<p>and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.</p>
<p>Then the farmers don&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p>Then they can&rsquo;t grow crops.</p>
<p>And I think, yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what would happen.</p>
<p>And so Yon told me 1.2 billion,</p>
<p>and then Bjorn Lomborg said the same thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even ask him.</p>
<p>He just made it as an offhand comment.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think&hellip;</p>
<p>In the Ukraine?</p>
<p>In the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Fun, fun, fun.</p>
<p>Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned</p>
<p>in the last few sentences kind of echo</p>
<p>to that part of human history.</p>
<p>The hole in the door.</p>
<p>Do you&hellip;</p>
<p>No one knows about.</p>
<p>Well, now I&rsquo;ve just spent four weeks in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different parts of the world that still,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t know, they know.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>They feel.</p>
<p>They feel history runs in the blood.</p>
<p>The Dutch knew, in some sense.</p>
<p>They had a famine at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>And part of the reason the Dutch farmers</p>
<p>are so unbelievably efficient and productive</p>
<p>is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War II</p>
<p>that that was not going to happen again.</p>
<p>And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean</p>
<p>because Holland, that&rsquo;s quite a country.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s number two exporter.</p>
<p>You know that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s number two exporter</p>
<p>of agricultural products, Holland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big as Massachusetts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this little tiny place.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>And they want to put, here&rsquo;s the plan.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put 30% of the farmers out of business.</p>
<p>While the broader ecosystem of agricultural production</p>
<p>in Holland is 6% of their GDP.</p>
<p>Now these centralizing politicians think,</p>
<p>tell me if I&rsquo;m stupid about this.</p>
<p>Take an industry, you knock it back by fiat by 30%.</p>
<p>Now it runs on like a 3% profit margin.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re going to kill 30% of it.</p>
<p>How are you not going to bring the whole thing down?</p>
<p>The whole farming ecosystem down?</p>
<p>How are you not going to impoverish the transport systems?</p>
<p>How are you not going to demolish the grocery stores?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take something like that and pare it back</p>
<p>by fiat by 30% and not kill it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see how you can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.</p>
<p>We broke the supply chains.</p>
<p>We tried buying something lately.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, and wait, and aren&rsquo;t the Chinese threatening</p>
<p>Taiwan at the moment?</p>
<p>What are we going to do without chips?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what these people are thinking.</p>
<p>And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?</p>
<p>Well, the Deloitte people are thinking,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t we smart and shouldn&rsquo;t we be hired</p>
<p>by our corporate employers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, too bad about the poor.</p>
<p>What are the environmentalists thinking?</p>
<p>We love the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you?</p>
<p>We love the poor.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s pit the planet against the poor.</p>
<p>Who wins?</p>
<p>The planet.</p>
<p>Okay, you don&rsquo;t love the poor that much.</p>
<p>Do you love the planet or do you hate capitalism?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pit those two things against each other.</p>
<p>Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.</p>
<p>How can we tell?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re willing to break it.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going to happen in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?</p>
<p>Are they going to eat all the animals?</p>
<p>Are they going to burn all the firewood?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stockpiling firewood in Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, so is your environmental globalist utopia</p>
<p>going to kill the poor and destroy the planet?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay, because we&rsquo;ll wipe out capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon</p>
<p>drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,</p>
<p>some of which can destroy that world.</p>
<p>Now, what do you think of that theory about trustworthiness?</p>
<p>If the dragon that you&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>turns you into a terrified tyrant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not the man for the job.</p>
<p>Is that a good theory?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting theory.</p>
<p>Let me use that theory to challenge,</p>
<p>because what does terror look like?</p>
<p>Let me table the turns, turn the tables on you.</p>
<p>You are terrified, afraid, concerned about the dragon</p>
<p>of something we can call communism, Marxism.</p>
<p>Am I terrified of it?</p>
<p>Well, okay, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not terrified enough to be a tyrant.</p>
<p>Your theories had two components.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not paralyzed.</p>
<p>Had a dragon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not paralyzed, and I don&rsquo;t wanna be a tyrant.</p>
<p>The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.</p>
<p>But you are very concerned.</p>
<p>The intensity of your feeling</p>
<p>does not give much space,</p>
<p>actually, at least in your public persona,</p>
<p>for sitting quietly with the dragon</p>
<p>and sipping on a couple of beers</p>
<p>and thinking about this thing.</p>
<p>The intensity of your anger,</p>
<p>concern about certain things you&rsquo;re seeing in society,</p>
<p>is that going to drive you off the path</p>
<p>that ultimately takes us to a better world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to get that right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve kind of come to a cultural conclusion</p>
<p>about the Nazis.</p>
<p>Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?</p>
<p>Seems the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>Well, actually, let me push back here.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t trust people who are angry about the Nazis.</p>
<p>I mean the actual Nazis.</p>
<p>Well, as you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the world</p>
<p>that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>One of them is very important to me.</p>
<p>Me, for example.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Nazi, or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.</p>
<p>I think they actually sort of steel man</p>
<p>all their perspectives.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an important thing there though,</p>
<p>because I went to the front in Ukraine,</p>
<p>and a lot of the people that lost their home</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re kind of, that got to interact a lot</p>
<p>with the Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian people</p>
<p>that interact with the Russian soldiers,</p>
<p>they reported that the Russian soldiers</p>
<p>really believe they&rsquo;re saving the people of Ukraine</p>
<p>in these local villages from the Nazis.</p>
<p>I understand, yeah.</p>
<p>So to them, it&rsquo;s not just that the Ukrainian government has</p>
<p>or Ukraine has some Nazis, it&rsquo;s like it has been,</p>
<p>the idea is that the Nazis have taken over Ukraine</p>
<p>and we need to free them.</p>
<p>This is the belief.</p>
<p>So this, again, Nazi is still a dragon that lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s used by people because it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>to sit next to that dragon</p>
<p>and spread any kind of ideology you want.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to kind of say that we have agreed</p>
<p>on this particular dragon,</p>
<p>but I still don&rsquo;t trust anybody who uses that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s, so this is a very complicated problem, right?</p>
<p>So Rene Girard believed that it was a human proclivity</p>
<p>to demonize a scapegoat and then drive it out</p>
<p>of the village.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve thought about that a lot.</p>
<p>We need a place to put Satan.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a serious issue.</p>
<p>Should he be inside the village or outside?</p>
<p>Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Satan is best fought</p>
<p>on the battleground of your soul.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re fighting?</p>
<p>Is it communism?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the spirit of Cain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?</p>
<p>So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise</p>
<p>for becoming self conscious,</p>
<p>or when they become self conscious,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re destined to work.</p>
<p>And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>is that to become self conscious</p>
<p>is to become aware of the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to become aware of death.</p>
<p>That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story,</p>
<p>to have the scales fall from your eyes.</p>
<p>And then the consequence of that</p>
<p>is that you now have to labor to prevent</p>
<p>the catastrophes of the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Work is sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sacrifice of the present to the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delay of gratification, it&rsquo;s maturity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sacrifice to something as well,</p>
<p>and in the spirit of something.</p>
<p>Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children, Cain and Abel.</p>
<p>So those are the first two people in history.</p>
<p>Because the Garden of Eden doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the first two people</p>
<p>who are born rather than created.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re the first two people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hell of a story,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a story of fratricidal murder</p>
<p>that degenerates into genocide, flood, and tyranny.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fun for the opening salvo of the story, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.</p>
<p>And for some reason, Abel&rsquo;s sacrifice is please God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly clear why.</p>
<p>And Cain&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an implication in the text</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s because Cain&rsquo;s sacrifices are true,</p>
<p>are second rate.</p>
<p>God says that Abel brings the finest</p>
<p>to the sacrificial altar.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say that about Cain.</p>
<p>So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s holding something in reserve.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not all in, he&rsquo;s not bringing his best to the table.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not offering his best to God.</p>
<p>And so Abel thrives like mad.</p>
<p>And everyone loves him.</p>
<p>And he gets exactly what he needs and wants,</p>
<p>exactly when he needs and wants it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s favored of God.</p>
<p>And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward</p>
<p>and working, and his sacrifices are rejected.</p>
<p>So he gets resentful, really resentful.</p>
<p>Enough resentful enough to call God out</p>
<p>and say something like,</p>
<p>this is quite the creation you&rsquo;ve got going here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m breaking myself in half</p>
<p>and nothing good&rsquo;s coming my way.</p>
<p>What the hell&rsquo;s up with that?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Abel, the sun shining on him every day.</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>But this is God that Cain&rsquo;s talking to.</p>
<p>And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,</p>
<p>which is what God usually says to people.</p>
<p>He says, look to your own devices.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not making the sacrifices you should.</p>
<p>And you know it.</p>
<p>And then he says something even worse.</p>
<p>He says, sin crouches at your door</p>
<p>like a sexually aroused predatory animal.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve invited it in to have your way,</p>
<p>to have its way with you.</p>
<p>And so he basically says,</p>
<p>you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re brooding upon it</p>
<p>and generating something creative, new and awful,</p>
<p>possessed by the spirit of resentment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re in the miserable state you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So then Cain leaves, his countenance falls,</p>
<p>as you might expect, and Cain leaves.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so incensed by this because God has said,</p>
<p>look, your problems are of your own making.</p>
<p>And not only that, you invited them in.</p>
<p>And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.</p>
<p>And not only that, you&rsquo;re blaming it on me.</p>
<p>And not only that, that&rsquo;s making you jealous of Abel,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s your actual idol and goal.</p>
<p>And Cain, instead of changing, kills Abel, right?</p>
<p>And then Cain&rsquo;s descendants are the first people</p>
<p>who make weapons of war.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, okay, you wanna know what I think?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the eternal story of mankind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s playing out right now,</p>
<p>except at a thousand times the rate.</p>
<p>Can I present to you a difficult truth?</p>
<p>Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have,</p>
<p>that it is not always easy to know</p>
<p>which among us are the Cain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>And resentment, it is possible to imagine you</p>
<p>as the person who has a resentment</p>
<p>towards a particular worldview that you really worry about.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine last week</p>
<p>about that publicly, we&rsquo;ll release it.</p>
<p>So I said, well, do I have a particular animus</p>
<p>against the left, let&rsquo;s say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, probably.</p>
<p>Okay, why?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;m a university professor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the universities are threatened by the right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re threatened by the left, 100%.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not just threatened a little bit,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re threatened a lot.</p>
<p>And that threat made it impossible</p>
<p>for me to continue in my profession the way I was.</p>
<p>And it cost me my clinical practice too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits</p>
<p>against me out right now from the College of Psychologists</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve allowed anyone to complain about me</p>
<p>anywhere in the world for any reason,</p>
<p>and have the choice to follow that up with an investigation,</p>
<p>which is a punishment in and of itself, and are doing so.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve been tortured nearly to death multiple times</p>
<p>by bad actors on the left.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of radical right wingers</p>
<p>being unhappy with what I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>but personally, that&rsquo;s been the left the whole time.</p>
<p>Not only me, but my family, put my family at risk</p>
<p>in a big way and constantly, like not once or twice,</p>
<p>because many people get canceled once or twice.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been canceled like 40 times.</p>
<p>And I know like 200 people now who&rsquo;ve been canceled.</p>
<p>And I can tell you without doubt,</p>
<p>that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s if it only happens once.</p>
<p>And so, and then I also know that the communists killed</p>
<p>100 million people in the 20th century,</p>
<p>that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop</p>
<p>and still haven&rsquo;t quit, that almost no one knows about it,</p>
<p>and that the specter of resentful Marxism</p>
<p>is back in full force.</p>
<p>And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Does it go too far?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>The story you just told, it seems nearly impossible</p>
<p>for you, an intellectual powerhouse,</p>
<p>not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>And this is the, so let me challenge you.</p>
<p>Yeah, go right ahead, man.</p>
<p>Let me challenge you.</p>
<p>Can you steal, man, the case that the prime minister</p>
<p>of this country, Trudeau, wants the best for this country</p>
<p>and actually might do good things for this country</p>
<p>as an intellectual challenge?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>He seems to get along well with his wife.</p>
<p>He has some kids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sexual scandals.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in a position where that could easily be the case.</p>
<p>He seems to have done some good things</p>
<p>on the oceanic management front.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s put a fair bit of Canada&rsquo;s oceans</p>
<p>into marine protected areas,</p>
<p>and that might be his most fundamental legacy, if it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get information</p>
<p>about the actual reality of the protection,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t been able to do that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>So sorry, the family thing is, there&rsquo;s some aspect of.</p>
<p>It speaks to his character.</p>
<p>This is a character.</p>
<p>There is some aspect to him that makes him a good man</p>
<p>in that sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the evidence there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate on the sexual front,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage,</p>
<p>and he has kids, so good for him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good start, by the way, for a leader.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>To be a good man.</p>
<p>Well, then I also thought, okay,</p>
<p>well, after the Liberals had brought in</p>
<p>a Harvard intellectual who was a Canadian</p>
<p>to be their last leader, he didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re flailing about for a leader,</p>
<p>and the Liberals in Canada are pretty good</p>
<p>at maintaining power and leadership,</p>
<p>and have been the dominant governing party in Canada</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And so they went to Justin and said,</p>
<p>well, you know, it&rsquo;s you or a Conservative,</p>
<p>and you can imagine that&rsquo;s not a positive specter</p>
<p>for someone who&rsquo;s on the left, or even a Liberal,</p>
<p>especially, and Trudeau&rsquo;s quite a bit on the left.</p>
<p>And they said, we need you to run.</p>
<p>And then I thought, okay, well,</p>
<p>the answer to that should have been no,</p>
<p>because Trudeau, Justin, has no training for this,</p>
<p>no experience.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s a part time drama teacher, fundamentally.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t run a business.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t know enough to be Prime Minister.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m trying to put myself in his position, eh?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, I don&rsquo;t know enough, but I&rsquo;m young,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t want the Conservatives,</p>
<p>and they had had a run, a 10 year run,</p>
<p>so maybe it was time for a new government.</p>
<p>I could, maybe I could grow into this man.</p>
<p>Maybe I could surround myself with good people,</p>
<p>and I could learn humbly, and I could become</p>
<p>the person I&rsquo;m now pretending to be,</p>
<p>which we all have to do as we move forward, right?</p>
<p>And so then I thought, okay,</p>
<p>I think you made a mistake there,</p>
<p>because you ran only on your father&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t have the background,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s give the devil his due,</p>
<p>and say that&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>Okay, so now what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, you get elected, and your first act is</p>
<p>to make the cabinet 50% women,</p>
<p>despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members</p>
<p>are female.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you just have your talent pool.</p>
<p>That was a really bad move for your first move.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about that?</p>
<p>Do you think, where does that move come from?</p>
<p>Deep somewhere in the heart?</p>
<p>Or is it trying to listen to the social forces</p>
<p>of the moment, and try to ride those ways towards</p>
<p>maybe greater and greater popularity?</p>
<p>By after thinking it through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, you just have your talent pool</p>
<p>for cabinet positions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough cabinet positions.</p>
<p>You know, you could argue that each of them met threshold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between threshold and excellent.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think that came from a place of compassion?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t regard compassion as a virtue.</p>
<p>Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think?</p>
<p>Judicious compassion is a virtue.</p>
<p>Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Compassion can come deep from the human heart</p>
<p>and the human mind, I think.</p>
<p>Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Trying to understand the suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Well, compassion isn&rsquo;t treating adults like infants.</p>
<p>I mean, those are just terms.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Whatever the term is, maybe love is maybe the better word.</p>
<p>Edible compassion is.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose I&rsquo;m speaking to love.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think those ideas came from concern?</p>
<p>Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.</p>
<p>Love is complicated, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has a lot of good things in it, yes.</p>
<p>If I love you, is it compassion</p>
<p>or encouragement you want from me?</p>
<p>Yeah, the dance.</p>
<p>Love is definitely a dance of two humans, ultimately,</p>
<p>that leads to the growth of both, yes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The growth element is crucial.</p>
<p>Because the growth element, to foster the growth element,</p>
<p>that requires judgment.</p>
<p>Compassion and judgment, well, even,</p>
<p>and have been conceptualized this way forever,</p>
<p>two hands of God, mercy and justice.</p>
<p>They have to operate in tandem, right?</p>
<p>And mercy is flawed as you are, you&rsquo;re acceptable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, do you want that?</p>
<p>Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s where the judgment comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but you could be better.</p>
<p>You could be more than you are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the maternal and the paternal</p>
<p>in some fundamental sense.</p>
<p>And there has to be a active exchange of information</p>
<p>between those two poles.</p>
<p>So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, yeah, just how loving are you, first of all?</p>
<p>No, it was a really bad decision.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s expressed contempt for monetary policy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in monetary policy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, but you&rsquo;re a prime minister.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s expressed admiration</p>
<p>for the Chinese Communist Party,</p>
<p>because they can be very efficient</p>
<p>in their pursuit of environmental goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?</p>
<p>The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.</p>
<p>And so, and I&rsquo;ve watched him repeatedly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve listened to him a lot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried to do that clinically</p>
<p>and with some degree of dispassion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard too, because his father, Pierre,</p>
<p>devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.</p>
<p>And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.</p>
<p>And so as a westerner as well,</p>
<p>I have an inbuilt animus and one that&rsquo;s well deserved,</p>
<p>because central Canada,</p>
<p>especially the glittery literati elite types</p>
<p>in the Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto triangle</p>
<p>have exploited the West and expressed contempt for the West</p>
<p>far too much for far too long.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s accelerating at the moment, for example,</p>
<p>with Trudeau&rsquo;s recent attack on the Canadian farmers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an enemy of the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe.</p>
<p>And look what&rsquo;s happened in Europe,</p>
<p>at least in partial consequence.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s no friend to the farmers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried to steel man him.</p>
<p>I try to put myself in the position of the people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m criticizing.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a narcissist.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a degree to which power changed him?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not suited for the position,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not the man for the position,</p>
<p>you can be absolutely 100% sure</p>
<p>that the power will corrupt you.</p>
<p>How could it not?</p>
<p>I mean, at the least, if you don&rsquo;t have the chops</p>
<p>for the job, you have to devalue the job</p>
<p>to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.</p>
<p>So yes, I think that it&rsquo;s corrupted him.</p>
<p>And I mean, look at him doubling down.</p>
<p>We wear masks in flights into Canada.</p>
<p>We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form</p>
<p>on our phones because a passport isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t get a passport.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re 85 and you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to use a smartphone?</p>
<p>Oh, well, too bad for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, it&rsquo;s corrupted him.</p>
<p>Would you talk to him?</p>
<p>If you were to sit down and talk with him</p>
<p>and he wanted to talk,</p>
<p>would you and what kind of things would you talk about,</p>
<p>perhaps on your podcast?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever said no to talking to anyone.</p>
<p>So, which is, you know.</p>
<p>Would you, would that be a first</p>
<p>or would you make that conversation?</p>
<p>Do you believe in the power of those kinds of contexts?</p>
<p>No, if he was willing to talk to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d talk because I&rsquo;d like to ask him.</p>
<p>I have lots of things I&rsquo;d like to ask him about.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had political types in Canada</p>
<p>on my podcast and tried to ask them questions.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to know.</p>
<p>You know, maybe I&rsquo;ve got a big part of him wrong.</p>
<p>And I probably do, but my observation has been</p>
<p>that every chance he had to retreat</p>
<p>from his pharaonic position, let&rsquo;s say, he doubled down.</p>
<p>And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still zoom in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still COVID lockdown parliament.</p>
<p>For the next year, it&rsquo;s already been fatally compromised,</p>
<p>perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>And this is parliament we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a kind of paralysis, fear driven paralysis</p>
<p>that also, in part, some of the most brilliant people</p>
<p>I know are lost in this paralysis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people have signed a word to it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like a fear of this unknown thing</p>
<p>that lurks in the shadows.</p>
<p>And that, unfortunately, that fear is leveraged by people</p>
<p>that, you know, who are in academic circles,</p>
<p>who are in faculty or students,</p>
<p>and so on, or more in administration.</p>
<p>And they start to use that fear,</p>
<p>which makes me quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It does lend people in the positions of power</p>
<p>who are not good at handling that power</p>
<p>to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.</p>
<p>I was really trying to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>the last two weeks, thinking this through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you know?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say someone asked me a question</p>
<p>in the YouTube comments, said,</p>
<p>why can I trust your advice on the environmental front?</p>
<p>And I thought, that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s see if we can figure out the principles</p>
<p>by which the advice would be trustworthy.</p>
<p>Okay, how do you know it&rsquo;s not trustworthy?</p>
<p>Well, one potential response to that would be</p>
<p>the claims are not in accordance with the facts,</p>
<p>but, you know, facts are tricky things</p>
<p>and it depends on where you look for them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tough one to get right because,</p>
<p>for example, Lomberg&rsquo;s fundamental critics</p>
<p>argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.</p>
<p>So that can&rsquo;t be an unerring guide.</p>
<p>And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because when it&rsquo;s about everything, there&rsquo;s too many facts.</p>
<p>So then how do you determine if someone&rsquo;s a trustworthy guide</p>
<p>in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s really the question.</p>
<p>And the answer is they&rsquo;re not terrified tyrants.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the answer.</p>
<p>Now, maybe that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>If someone has a better answer.</p>
<p>How do you know if they&rsquo;re a terrified tyrant?</p>
<p>Because they are willing to use compulsion on other people.</p>
<p>When they could use goodwill.</p>
<p>Like the farmers in Canada objected.</p>
<p>They said, look, we have every economic reason</p>
<p>to use as little fertilizer as we can.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.</p>
<p>We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially</p>
<p>in the last 40 years, you can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And we grow way more food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already breaking ourselves in half.</p>
<p>And if you know farmers,</p>
<p>especially the ones who still survive,</p>
<p>you think those people don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, they&rsquo;re pretty damn sophisticated man.</p>
<p>Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.</p>
<p>And now you tell them, no, it&rsquo;s a 30% reduction.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t care how much food you&rsquo;re growing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a reduction that&rsquo;s dependent</p>
<p>on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,</p>
<p>which would be at least you could imagine it.</p>
<p>So, okay, so you&rsquo;re producing this much food</p>
<p>and you use this much fertilizer.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re hyper efficient.</p>
<p>Maybe we take the 10% of farmers</p>
<p>who are the least efficient in that metric.</p>
<p>And we say to them,</p>
<p>you have to get as efficient as the average farmer.</p>
<p>And then they say, well, look, you know,</p>
<p>our situation&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a more Northern climb, the soil&rsquo;s weaker.</p>
<p>You know, you obviously have to bargain with that,</p>
<p>but at least you reward them for their productivity.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like, well, Holland isn&rsquo;t gonna have beef.</p>
<p>Well, where are they gonna get it?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I see.</p>
<p>You get to tell me what I can eat now, do you?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And Holland is gonna import food from where</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more efficient on the fertilizer front.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one more efficient than Holland.</p>
<p>And same with Canada.</p>
<p>And like, isn&rsquo;t this gonna make food prices more expensive?</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t that mean that hungry people die?</p>
<p>Cause that is what it means.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Ultimately, poor people pay the price</p>
<p>of these kinds of policies.</p>
<p>Not known, not ultimately.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crucial distinction because they say,</p>
<p>well, ultimately the poor will benefit.</p>
<p>Yeah, except the dead ones.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>Today, right.</p>
<p>It seems like the story of war to,</p>
<p>is a time when the poor people suffer</p>
<p>from the decision made by the powerful, the rich,</p>
<p>the political elite.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I got into plenty of trouble about that too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re just a man in a suit</p>
<p>talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also people dying, fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their land, it&rsquo;s their country, it&rsquo;s their history.</p>
<p>This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people trying to ask, they have many dragons</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re asking themselves a question,</p>
<p>who are we?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>What is the future of this nation?</p>
<p>We thought we are a great nation.</p>
<p>And I think both countries say this.</p>
<p>And they say, well, how do we become the great nation</p>
<p>we thought we are?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so what, first of all, you got in trouble.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dynamics of the trouble?</p>
<p>And is there something you regret saying?</p>
<p>No, no, I thought about it a lot.</p>
<p>I laid out four reasons for the war.</p>
<p>And then I was criticized in the Atlantic</p>
<p>for the argument was reduced to one reason,</p>
<p>which was a caricature of the reason.</p>
<p>I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.</p>
<p>Mismanagement on the part of the West in relationship</p>
<p>to Russia and foreign policy over the last,</p>
<p>since the wall fell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable because it&rsquo;s extremely complex.</p>
<p>Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy</p>
<p>provision for Europe in the wake of idiot environmental</p>
<p>globalist utopianism.</p>
<p>The expansionist tendencies of Russia</p>
<p>that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet Union empire</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for,</p>
<p>which is Putin&rsquo;s belief or willingness</p>
<p>to manipulate his people into believing</p>
<p>that Russia is a salvific force in the face</p>
<p>of idiot Western wokeism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one I got in trouble for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, while you&rsquo;re justifying Putin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not only the Russians</p>
<p>that think the West has lost its mind.</p>
<p>The Eastern Europeans think so too.</p>
<p>And do I know that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries</p>
<p>this spring.</p>
<p>And I talked to 300 political and cultural leaders.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, they were all conservatives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, actually, no, they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most of them were conservatives.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more willing to talk to me.</p>
<p>But a good chunk of them were liberals</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.</p>
<p>Well, because you&rsquo;re very concerned</p>
<p>about the culture wars that perhaps</p>
<p>are a signal of a possible bad future for this country</p>
<p>and for this part of the world, that reason stands out.</p>
<p>And do you, sort of looking back at four reasons,</p>
<p>think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Because it is, you know.</p>
<p>Well, the four was bifurcated.</p>
<p>Because I said, look, Putin might believe this.</p>
<p>And I actually think he does.</p>
<p>Because I read a bunch of Putin speeches.</p>
<p>And I have been reading them for 15 years.</p>
<p>And my sense of people generally,</p>
<p>and this was true of Hitler, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what did Hitler believe?</p>
<p>Well, did you read what he wrote?</p>
<p>He just did what he said he was going to do.</p>
<p>And you might think, well, some people are so tricky,</p>
<p>they have a whole body of elaborated speech</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely separate from their personality.</p>
<p>And their personality is pursuing a different agenda.</p>
<p>And this whole body of speech is nothing but affront.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.</p>
<p>First of all, if you say things long enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to believe them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting and fascinating and important</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,</p>
<p>I think Hitler is an example of somebody</p>
<p>that I think really quickly you start</p>
<p>to believe the propaganda.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve thought a lot about AI systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t you become what you practice?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.</p>
<p>We even know the neurology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you first formulate a concept,</p>
<p>huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.</p>
<p>But as you practice that, first of all,</p>
<p>the right hemisphere stops participating.</p>
<p>And then the left participates less and less</p>
<p>until you build specialized machinery for exactly</p>
<p>that conceptual frame.</p>
<p>And then you start to see it, not just think it.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re telling the same lies over and over,</p>
<p>who do you think you&rsquo;re fooling?</p>
<p>Think, well, I can withstand my own lies,</p>
<p>not if they&rsquo;re effective lies.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re effective enough to fool millions of people,</p>
<p>and then they reflect them back to you,</p>
<p>what makes you think you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be able to withstand that?</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree</p>
<p>that he believes anything, I do believe</p>
<p>that he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom</p>
<p>against the degeneration of the West.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that third way that Dugin and Putin</p>
<p>have been talking about, the philosopher Alexander Dugin</p>
<p>and Putin for 15 years.</p>
<p>Now, what that is is very amorphous.</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians</p>
<p>would have to return to the incremental development</p>
<p>of Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.</p>
<p>And to some degree, that&rsquo;s happened in Russia</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s been a return to Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox church</p>
<p>has just been coopted by the state.</p>
<p>And I would say there&rsquo;s some evidence for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns,</p>
<p>now I don&rsquo;t know if this is true,</p>
<p>owns $5 billion worth of personal property.</p>
<p>And I would say there&rsquo;s a bit of a moral hazard in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that the Orthodox church</p>
<p>has been coopted.</p>
<p>But there has been somewhat of an Orthodox revival in Russia.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all bad.</p>
<p>Now, even if Putin doesn&rsquo;t believe any of this,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s just a psychopathic manipulator,</p>
<p>and unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read his speeches.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like it to me.</p>
<p>And he is by no means the worst Russian leader</p>
<p>of the last 100 years.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s quite a selection there.</p>
<p>There certainly is.</p>
<p>And I say that knowing that.</p>
<p>Even if he doesn&rsquo;t believe it, he&rsquo;s convinced his people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re stuck with the claim in either case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the point I was trying to make in the article.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m troubled by people that explain things.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have reached out to me, experts,</p>
<p>telling me how I should feel, what</p>
<p>I should think about Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh, you naive Lex, you&rsquo;re so naive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it really is.</p>
<p>But then I get to see people that lost their home.</p>
<p>I get to see people on the Russian side who believe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, I genuinely think that there&rsquo;s some degree to which</p>
<p>they have love in their heart.</p>
<p>They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.</p>
<p>How else would you motivate young men to go fight?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s these humans destroying not only their homes,</p>
<p>but creating generational hate, destroying</p>
<p>the possibility of love towards each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically creating hate.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of is on February 24 of this year,</p>
<p>hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.</p>
<p>Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not</p>
<p>the soldiers in Russia, but hate towards all Russians.</p>
<p>Hate that will last generations.</p>
<p>And then you can see just the pain there.</p>
<p>And then when all these experts talk about agriculture,</p>
<p>and energy, and geopolitics, and yeah,</p>
<p>maybe like what you say with fighting</p>
<p>the ideologies of the woke and so on,</p>
<p>I just feel like it&rsquo;s missing something deep,</p>
<p>that war is not fought about any of those things.</p>
<p>War is started, and war is averted based on human beings,</p>
<p>based on humanity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another ugly thought, since we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had enough so far.</p>
<p>We locked everything down for COVID.</p>
<p>How much face to face communication</p>
<p>was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>How about none?</p>
<p>How about that was the wrong amount,</p>
<p>especially given that Europe was completely dependent on Putin</p>
<p>for its energy supplies?</p>
<p>Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Materially and significantly.</p>
<p>Maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s in a bit of a bubble.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>And not just an information bubble,</p>
<p>how all these experts tell me about.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, a human bubble.</p>
<p>Look, one of the things I&rsquo;ve really learned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real emphasis on hospitality</p>
<p>in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>I just brought all these scholars together</p>
<p>to talk about Exodus.</p>
<p>Hey, I have this security team with me,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re tough military guys.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re on board for this mission, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And so they went out of their way</p>
<p>to be hospitable to my academic guests.</p>
<p>They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.</p>
<p>They spent all day preparing this house</p>
<p>I had rented so that we could have a hospitable time</p>
<p>with these scholars.</p>
<p>Most of whom I didn&rsquo;t know well,</p>
<p>but who said they would come and spend eight days</p>
<p>talking about this book with me.</p>
<p>We rented some jet skis.</p>
<p>We had a nice house.</p>
<p>We had fun.</p>
<p>And we got to know each other.</p>
<p>And we got to trust each other</p>
<p>because we could see that we could have some fun</p>
<p>and that we could let our hair down a bit.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to be on guard.</p>
<p>And that made the talks way deeper.</p>
<p>And then we found out we couldn&rsquo;t get through Exodus</p>
<p>in eight days.</p>
<p>And so I had proposed very early on</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna double the length.</p>
<p>And so I pulled eight people out of their lives</p>
<p>for eight days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also quite expensive.</p>
<p>And the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.</p>
<p>And they said, right.</p>
<p>They said, yes, right away.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d love to do this again.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>Well, partly because it was intellectually,</p>
<p>it was unbelievably engaging.</p>
<p>I learned so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take me like a year to digest it</p>
<p>if I can ever digest it.</p>
<p>But they had a really good time.</p>
<p>And so when they were offered that combination</p>
<p>of intellectual challenge, let&rsquo;s say in hospitality,</p>
<p>it was a no brainer.</p>
<p>They just said, every one of them said,</p>
<p>if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.</p>
<p>And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times</p>
<p>and the culture of hospitality has broken down</p>
<p>in Washington.</p>
<p>40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have apartments.</p>
<p>Their family isn&rsquo;t there with them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have social occasions with their fellow Democrats</p>
<p>or Republicans, much less across the table.</p>
<p>And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington</p>
<p>that were bilateral a couple of times,</p>
<p>get young Republican congressmen</p>
<p>and Democrats together to talk.</p>
<p>And as soon as they talk, they think,</p>
<p>oh, it was so interesting.</p>
<p>Cause one of the lunches was about 15 people,</p>
<p>half Democrats and half Republicans.</p>
<p>And all I&rsquo;d asked them to do was just spend three minutes</p>
<p>talking about why you decided to become a congressman,</p>
<p>which is not a job I would take, by the way.</p>
<p>You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.</p>
<p>Your family isn&rsquo;t there with you.</p>
<p>You have to run for reelection every two years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re beholden to the party apparatus, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re vilified constantly.</p>
<p>This is not, you know, people think,</p>
<p>well, this is a job for the privileged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you go and run for Congress</p>
<p>and find out how much fun it is</p>
<p>and put your family on the line</p>
<p>and then have to beg for your job every two years</p>
<p>while your enemies, the worst of your enemies</p>
<p>and the worst of your friends</p>
<p>are viciously hen pecking you.</p>
<p>And so anyways, we had them all sit around the table</p>
<p>and said, okay, just say why you ran for Congress.</p>
<p>It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,</p>
<p>cause you Americans, you&rsquo;re so bloody theatrical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such something to watch.</p>
<p>It was like, Mr. Smith goes to Washington</p>
<p>for every one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, this country has given us so much,</p>
<p>where our families have been so,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve benefited so much from our time here.</p>
<p>We think this is a wonderful country.</p>
<p>We really felt that we should give back.</p>
<p>And the next one would talk.</p>
<p>And it was like exactly the same story.</p>
<p>And then it didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if they were Republican or Democrat,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>No one could.</p>
<p>And was it genuine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, are you genuine?</p>
<p>You think these people are worse than you?</p>
<p>First of all, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Second of all, they&rsquo;re probably better.</p>
<p>All things considered,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that easy to become a Congressman.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some bad apples in the bunch,</p>
<p>but by and large,</p>
<p>you walk away from your meetings with these people</p>
<p>and you think, pretty impressive.</p>
<p>They really are giving a part of themselves</p>
<p>in the name of service.</p>
<p>Maybe over time, they become cynical</p>
<p>and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of it.</p>
<p>Could you imagine that?</p>
<p>Is healed, I think.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m, well, I&rsquo;m in part naive,</p>
<p>but not fully,</p>
<p>that a lot of it is healed</p>
<p>through the power of conversation,</p>
<p>just basic social interaction.</p>
<p>I do think that the effects of this pandemic.</p>
<p>Especially by listening.</p>
<p>Listen, just sitting there.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be talking about the actual issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually humor and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>about personal struggles,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that remind you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re all just humans.</p>
<p>Well, the great leaders that I&rsquo;ve met,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve met some now,</p>
<p>they go listen to their constituents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a policy discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an ideology discussion.</p>
<p>They go say, okay, what&rsquo;s your life like?</p>
<p>And what are your problems?</p>
<p>And tell me about them.</p>
<p>And then they listen and then they&rsquo;re struck by them.</p>
<p>And then they gather up all that misery</p>
<p>and they bring it to the congressional office</p>
<p>or to the parliament.</p>
<p>And they think, here&rsquo;s what the people are crying out for.</p>
<p>And the good leaders, that&rsquo;s a leader.</p>
<p>Leader listens.</p>
<p>So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s sold out stages worldwide on a tour, being funny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>He said, comedy is the most standup comedy,</p>
<p>which is what I do in some real sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing I do that it&rsquo;s most akin</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m doing on my book tours, I would say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the closest analog.</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s the most dialogical enterprise.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, why, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Cause see, it&rsquo;s just the monologue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a prepared monologue.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re telling your jokes</p>
<p>and you gotta get the timing right,</p>
<p>but you have a body of jokes.</p>
<p>He said, well, here&rsquo;s how you prepare the jokes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been told this by other comedians.</p>
<p>You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour</p>
<p>and you got some new material and you think it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And you go into a club and you lay out your new material</p>
<p>and people laugh at some of it.</p>
<p>And you pay attention to what they laugh at</p>
<p>and what they don&rsquo;t laugh at.</p>
<p>So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd</p>
<p>and you get rid of everything that isn&rsquo;t funny.</p>
<p>And if you do that enough, even if you&rsquo;re not that funny,</p>
<p>the crowd will tell you what&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows</p>
<p>and each is an hour long</p>
<p>and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.</p>
<p>So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,</p>
<p>more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not very funny at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like funny 2% of the time.</p>
<p>You aggregate that, man, you&rsquo;re a scream.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what a leader does is,</p>
<p>that is what a leader does is goes out</p>
<p>and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.</p>
<p>And then I do think that&rsquo;s revivify</p>
<p>to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded</p>
<p>because then the person can say to themselves,</p>
<p>despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gathering up the misery and the hope</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m bringing it forward where it can be redressed.</p>
<p>Giving it a voice.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, giving it a voice.</p>
<p>Can you actually take me through a day</p>
<p>because this is fascinating, through your comedy tour.</p>
<p>What does a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?</p>
<p>Which is this very interesting day.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the day when you have to speak.</p>
<p>Preparing your mind,</p>
<p>thinking of what you&rsquo;re going to talk about,</p>
<p>preparing yourself physically and mentally</p>
<p>to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking,</p>
<p>how do you adjust what you&rsquo;re thinking through</p>
<p>and how do you come down from that?</p>
<p>So you can start all again as a limited biological system.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m usually up by seven</p>
<p>and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.</p>
<p>Coffee?</p>
<p>No, steak and water.</p>
<p>How many times a day steak?</p>
<p>All, that&rsquo;s all I eat.</p>
<p>How many times?</p>
<p>Three or four, depending on the day.</p>
<p>Steak and water.</p>
<p>Steak and sparkling water.</p>
<p>Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.</p>
<p>Well, I did the proper, I usually just once a day,</p>
<p>I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night</p>
<p>and just ate two steaks.</p>
<p>And how was that?</p>
<p>It was wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,</p>
<p>you know, could be worse.</p>
<p>So anyways, I&rsquo;m ready to go at eight</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re generally moving.</p>
<p>What does moving mean?</p>
<p>Flying. You&rsquo;re constantly.</p>
<p>Flying somewhere.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we usually use private flights now</p>
<p>because the commercial airlines aren&rsquo;t reliable enough</p>
<p>and you cannot not make a venue, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s rule number one on a tour.</p>
<p>You make the show.</p>
<p>So everything, and then number rule number two</p>
<p>is anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone</p>
<p>because there is zero room for error.</p>
<p>Now, no, there&rsquo;s zero room for unnecessary,</p>
<p>unaddressed error.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gonna be errors.</p>
<p>The guys I have around me now, if they make a mistake,</p>
<p>they fix it right away.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people relying on you to be there.</p>
<p>So you have to be there.</p>
<p>Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.</p>
<p>So then I&rsquo;m on the plane and I usually write or often</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no internet on the plane</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a good use of time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m writing a new book.</p>
<p>So I write on the plane.</p>
<p>Typing or handwriting?</p>
<p>Typing, yeah, typing.</p>
<p>And then we land and we go to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually early afternoon by then we go to a hotel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a nice hotel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not corporate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like corporate hotels.</p>
<p>My secretary and one of my logistics guys</p>
<p>has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,</p>
<p>boutique hotels are usually in the old parts of the city,</p>
<p>especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.</p>
<p>And so we go there and then lunch usually.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s an air fryer and a steak</p>
<p>in the hotel room.</p>
<p>And I leave a trail of air fryers behind me</p>
<p>all across the world.</p>
<p>And then Tammy and I usually go out and have a walk</p>
<p>or something and take a look at the city.</p>
<p>And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half</p>
<p>or an hour, half an hour.</p>
<p>Like a nap?</p>
<p>Yeah, nap.</p>
<p>I have to sleep for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about all I can sleep,</p>
<p>but I need to do that in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>That refreshes your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, that gives me, that wakes me up again for the evening.</p>
<p>And then Tam has to sleep longer.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s still recovering from her illness.</p>
<p>And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s absolutely necessary for both of us</p>
<p>or things start to get frayed.</p>
<p>And so then we go to the venue</p>
<p>and then I usually sit for an hour.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m gonna lecture, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of Q and A&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a little easier.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m gonna lecture, I have to sit for an hour.</p>
<p>And then I think, okay, what question am I trying</p>
<p>to investigate?</p>
<p>I have to have that, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>What mystery am I trying to unravel?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually associated with one of the rules in my book</p>
<p>because technically it&rsquo;s a book tour,</p>
<p>but each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.</p>
<p>And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no end to the amount that can be explored.</p>
<p>And so I have the question,</p>
<p>my question might be something like put your house</p>
<p>in perfect order before you criticize the world.</p>
<p>Okay, what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>What does house mean?</p>
<p>What does put mean, that active verb?</p>
<p>What is perfect in order mean?</p>
<p>Why before you criticize the world?</p>
<p>What does it mean to criticize?</p>
<p>What does it mean to criticize the world?</p>
<p>How can you do that properly or improperly?</p>
<p>So I start to think about how to decompose the question.</p>
<p>And you start to think which of these decompositions</p>
<p>are important to really dig into?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, then they&rsquo;ll strike me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, there&rsquo;s something there</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been maybe noodling around on</p>
<p>that I would like to investigate further.</p>
<p>Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?</p>
<p>I think, well, I have this story that I know,</p>
<p>I have this story and I have this story,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t juxtaposed them before.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s gonna be some interesting interaction</p>
<p>in the juxtaposition.</p>
<p>So I have the question</p>
<p>and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.</p>
<p>And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.</p>
<p>And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that</p>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>And so then what I wanna do is concentrate on that process</p>
<p>while attending to the audience</p>
<p>to make sure that the words are landing</p>
<p>and then see if I can delve into it deeply enough</p>
<p>so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced this in podcasts, right?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but my experience has been</p>
<p>if I fall into the conversation</p>
<p>and we know about the timeframe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a natural narrative arc.</p>
<p>And then, so you&rsquo;ll kind of know when the midpoint is</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll kind of see when you&rsquo;re reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>And then if you really pay attention,</p>
<p>you can see that&rsquo;s a good place to stop.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of, you come to a point</p>
<p>and you have to be alert and patient to see that.</p>
<p>And you have to be willing to be satisfied</p>
<p>with where you&rsquo;ve got to.</p>
<p>But if you do that, and then it&rsquo;s like a comedian</p>
<p>making the punchline work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve got all these balls in the air</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going somewhere</p>
<p>and this is how they come together.</p>
<p>And people love that, right?</p>
<p>They say, oh, this and this and this and this and this.</p>
<p>Whack, together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an insight.</p>
<p>And it is very much like a punchline.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting because your mind actually,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a fan of your podcast too.</p>
<p>And you are always driving towards that.</p>
<p>I would say for me in a podcast conversation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a kind of Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p>type of exploration.</p>
<p>Down the rabbit hole, man.</p>
<p>And then you just, a new thing pops up,</p>
<p>the more absurd, the wilder, the better.</p>
<p>Conversations with Elon are like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, actually the more you drive towards an arc,</p>
<p>the more uncomfortable you start to get</p>
<p>in a fun, absurd conversation because,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m now one of the normies.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I wanna be, I want the rabbit.</p>
<p>I want the crazy because it makes it more fun.</p>
<p>But somehow throughout it, there is wisdom</p>
<p>that you try to grasp at such that there is a thread.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re following the thread, eh?</p>
<p>Yeah, the thread&rsquo;s the, well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do, that thread.</p>
<p>That thread is the proper balance</p>
<p>between structure and spontaneity.</p>
<p>And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the logos in the dialogos.</p>
<p>And it really is the logos.</p>
<p>And God only knows what that means.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, the biblical claim</p>
<p>is that logos is the fundamental principle of reality.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>because I think that that meaning that guides you,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s a way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about this recently.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s real matter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, that&rsquo;s one answer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s real?</p>
<p>What matters is real.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s how you act.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s different than matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, what&rsquo;s the most real of what matters?</p>
<p>How about pain?</p>
<p>Why is it the most real?</p>
<p>Try arguing it away.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>So pain is the fundamental reality.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?</p>
<p>Yeah, doesn&rsquo;t it lead to a philosophy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s antithetical towards being</p>
<p>the most fundamental reality is pain?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there anything more fundamental than pain?</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in pain,</p>
<p>love and truth,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you got.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re more powerful than pain,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re the most real things.</p>
<p>When you think about reality, what is real?</p>
<p>That is the most real thing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a tough one, right?</p>
<p>Because you have to,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re a scientist, a materialist,</p>
<p>think, well, the matter is the most real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you don&rsquo;t know what the matter is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, and then when push comes to shove,</p>
<p>and it will, you&rsquo;ll find out what&rsquo;s most real.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like this is missing,</p>
<p>the physical reality is missing some of the things.</p>
<p>So of course pain has a biological component</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s missing something deep about the human condition</p>
<p>that at least the modern science is not able to describe,</p>
<p>but it is reaching towards that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the reason, one way to describe it</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing is the reason it&rsquo;s reaching it</p>
<p>is because underneath of science is this assumption</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a deep.</p>
<p>Logos.</p>
<p>Thing to this whole thing we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Well, you know, there&rsquo;s two traditions, right?</p>
<p>In some sense, there&rsquo;s two logos traditions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a logos tradition.</p>
<p>And it insists that there&rsquo;s a logos in nature</p>
<p>and that science is the way to approach it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a Judeo Christian logos,</p>
<p>which is more embodied and more spiritual.</p>
<p>And I would say the West is actually an attempt</p>
<p>to unite those two.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the proper attempt to unite those two</p>
<p>because they need to be united.</p>
<p>And I see the union coming in your terms.</p>
<p>You know, I talked to friends to wall, for example</p>
<p>about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty close biologically.</p>
<p>Is it power?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the claim even from the biologists often</p>
<p>the most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, dominant.</p>
<p>Hey, you mean using compulsion?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s look.</p>
<p>Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?</p>
<p>And the answer is sporadically and rarely.</p>
<p>And for short, well, that&rsquo;s sporadically</p>
<p>for short periods of time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they meet an unpleasant end.</p>
<p>The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control</p>
<p>wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds, right?</p>
<p>Every dictators terror and for good reason.</p>
<p>And the wall has showed that the alpha chimps,</p>
<p>the males who do have preferential mating access often</p>
<p>are often and reliably the best peacemakers</p>
<p>and the most reciprocal.</p>
<p>And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty</p>
<p>is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a way better principle than power.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something like I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the antithesis of the spirit of power.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the spirit of play.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what you think about that,</p>
<p>but when you have a good podcast conversation,</p>
<p>you already described it in some sense as play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a structure, right?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s an ordered conversation,</p>
<p>but you want there to be play in the system.</p>
<p>And if you get that right, then it&rsquo;s really engaging.</p>
<p>And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to impose that even though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing I don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come to this conversation at all thinking,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I want out of a conversation</p>
<p>with Lex Friedman, like instrumentally.</p>
<p>I thought, I&rsquo;ll go talk to Lex.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I like his podcasts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing something right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>He asks interesting questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go have a conversation with him.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s it gonna go?</p>
<p>Wherever it goes.</p>
<p>Embracing the spirit of play.</p>
<p>So what you have this, when you&rsquo;re lecturing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going in front of the crowd,</p>
<p>you thought of a question, you get on the stage.</p>
<p>First of all, are you nervous at all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very nervous when I&rsquo;m sitting down,</p>
<p>thinking through the structure initially,</p>
<p>which is why my wife and I have been doing Q and As</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s easier on me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way comedians are nervous.</p>
<p>Like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.</p>
<p>And so he now has to sit nervously like a comedian does,</p>
<p>which is like, I have no material now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>When I was doing the lectures constantly</p>
<p>instead of the Q and As,</p>
<p>basically what I was doing was writing</p>
<p>a whole book chapter every night.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration</p>
<p>because I would return to themes that I had developed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really an exaggeration</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t ever just go over wrote material ever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very demanding and that part&rsquo;s nerve wracking</p>
<p>because I sit down, it&rsquo;s an hour before the show</p>
<p>and I think, can I do this?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, you did it a thousand times,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not this time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, can I come up with a question?</p>
<p>Can I think through the structure?</p>
<p>Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?</p>
<p>Can I pull it together?</p>
<p>And the answer is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so then I get it together in my mind, I think,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It takes effort and it&rsquo;s nerve wracking.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the moment you go out on stage</p>
<p>and you think, well, I know I had it, but can I do it?</p>
<p>No notes.</p>
<p>And then the question is,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re gonna find out while you do it.</p>
<p>And so then I go out on stage and I don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>to the audience, I talk to one person at a time.</p>
<p>And you can talk to one person,</p>
<p>cause you know how to do that.</p>
<p>So I talk to a person and not too long</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t wanna make them too nervous</p>
<p>and then someone else and someone else.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m in contact with the audience</p>
<p>and then I can tell if the words are landing</p>
<p>and I listen, it&rsquo;s like, are they rustling around?</p>
<p>Are they dead quiet?</p>
<p>Cause you want dead quiet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, oh, I see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what focus sounds like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in it together then.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>Well, and I also, here&rsquo;s a good rule</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re learning to speak publicly,</p>
<p>I never say a word till everyone is 100% quiet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a great way to start a talk</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re setting the frame,</p>
<p>and if the frame is we&rsquo;ll all talk while you&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>the message is, well, you can talk.</p>
<p>This is a place where everybody can talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna talk till everyone&rsquo;s listening.</p>
<p>And so then you get that stillness</p>
<p>and then you just wait</p>
<p>cause that stillness turns into an expectation.</p>
<p>And then it comes, turns into a kind of nervous expectations</p>
<p>like what the hell is he doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not manipulative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sense of timing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just when that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>you think, okay, now it&rsquo;s time to start.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing about that nervous expectation</p>
<p>is from an audience perspective, we&rsquo;re in it together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there is into that silence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a togetherness to it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s the union of everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you love that at a concert when everyone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not silence then,</p>
<p>but when everyone&rsquo;s attention is unified</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s moving in unison,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all worshiping the same thing, right?</p>
<p>And that would be the point of the conversation,</p>
<p>the point of the lecture.</p>
<p>And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s union, it&rsquo;s communion</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s doing it at the same time.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, there&rsquo;s not much difference</p>
<p>between a lecture theater and a church in that regard, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same fundamental layout and structure.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very integrally associated with one another.</p>
<p>One really grew out of the other,</p>
<p>the lecture theater grew out of the church.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable</p>
<p>to be thinking about it in those terms.</p>
<p>And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,</p>
<p>we play a piece of music that is a piece of music</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been producing with some musicians</p>
<p>for a couple of books I&rsquo;m gonna release in the fall.</p>
<p>Terrible books, ABC of childhood tragedy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called dark, dark books,</p>
<p>dark and comical books, terrible books,</p>
<p>heartbreaking illustrations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve set them to music.</p>
<p>And so we play a piece from that.</p>
<p>And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people</p>
<p>to have photographs.</p>
<p>And so each of those is a little.</p>
<p>Is there a little sparkle of human connection?</p>
<p>A lot, a lot, it&rsquo;s very intense.</p>
<p>10 seconds with every person you think,</p>
<p>how can 10 seconds be intense?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, pay enough attention.</p>
<p>It gets intense real quick.</p>
<p>Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being in a wedding lineup,</p>
<p>at a wedding that you wanna be at.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s dressed up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so weird,</p>
<p>because I bought these expensive suits</p>
<p>when I went on tour and it broke my heart</p>
<p>because I spent so much money on them.</p>
<p>I thought, God, that&rsquo;s completely unconscionable.</p>
<p>I thought, no way, man, I&rsquo;m in this 100%.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna dress with respect.</p>
<p>And like 60% of the audience comes in</p>
<p>two or three piece suits.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all dressed up.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this line to greet me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all happy to see me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not so hard to take.</p>
<p>You know, although it is in a sense, right?</p>
<p>Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.</p>
<p>And you think, I don&rsquo;t want shallow interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, you do most of the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s intense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very intense.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you have.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve had a taste of this, no doubt,</p>
<p>because people recognize you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I also have,</p>
<p>when a person recognizes me and they come with the love</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re often brilliant people,</p>
<p>one of the thoughts I have to deal with,</p>
<p>one of the dragons in my own mind is, you know,</p>
<p>thinking that I don&rsquo;t deserve that kind of attention.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Well, you probably don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But maybe you could.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a burden in that I have to step up</p>
<p>to be the kind of person that deserves that,</p>
<p>not deserves that, but in part deserves</p>
<p>that kind of attention.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, holy shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucially important too,</p>
<p>because if someone comes up to you in an airport</p>
<p>and they know who you are and they&rsquo;re brave enough</p>
<p>to admire you or who you are attempting to be</p>
<p>and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a high stakes enterprise.</p>
<p>And the flip side of that, especially with young people,</p>
<p>a few words you can say can change the direction</p>
<p>of their life.</p>
<p>One way or another.</p>
<p>And so I really have to watch this too in airports</p>
<p>because I do not like airports.</p>
<p>I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve always bothered me.</p>
<p>They really bother me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an unpleasant travel companion</p>
<p>for my wife sometimes because of that.</p>
<p>Although I think we&rsquo;ve worked that out.</p>
<p>Thank God, cause we&rsquo;re doing a lot of traveling.</p>
<p>But most of the security guards and the border personnel,</p>
<p>all those people, they know me.</p>
<p>And as a general rule, they&rsquo;re positively predisposed to me.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m peevish or irritable,</p>
<p>then well, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a tight rope to walk to</p>
<p>because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.</p>
<p>But by the same token, if you&rsquo;re just one of the crowd,</p>
<p>just, sometimes it&rsquo;s good just to be one of the crowd</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re a little irritable</p>
<p>and people can just brush that off.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re someone they have dared to open their heart to,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s what admiration is, and then you betray that,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a real, they&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll tell everyone too.</p>
<p>So it takes a lot of alertness.</p>
<p>And so Tammy and our life has got complicated</p>
<p>because in Toronto, for example,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t really just go for a walk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a high drama production</p>
<p>cause always people come up and they have some</p>
<p>heart rending story to tell.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not being cynical about that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard thing to bear because people don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just open themselves up to you like that</p>
<p>and share the tragedy of their life.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>And so when we go up to our cottage,</p>
<p>which is out of the city, it&rsquo;s a relief,</p>
<p>because as wonderful as that is,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a weird, I have a weird life</p>
<p>because everywhere I go, it&rsquo;s very weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m surrounded by old friends</p>
<p>because I walk down the street in any city now virtually</p>
<p>and people say, hello, Dr. Peterson, so nice to see you.</p>
<p>Or they say better things than that.</p>
<p>Very rarely bad things.</p>
<p>One experience in 5,000, maybe very rare,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t forget those either,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an intimacy, they know you well.</p>
<p>And because they leap into,</p>
<p>they avoid the small talk often.</p>
<p>They leap into familiarity.</p>
<p>It really is like it&rsquo;s an old friend</p>
<p>and it feels like that.</p>
<p>For me personally, the experiences, the goodbye hurts</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re never gonna see that friend again.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a strange thing, eh?</p>
<p>So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s, I suppose, in some sense,</p>
<p>part of the pain of opening yourself up to people</p>
<p>because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly.</p>
<p>She said, I really never knew what men were like.</p>
<p>I said, well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are</p>
<p>when they come and talk to you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always the same.</p>
<p>The pattern&rsquo;s very similar.</p>
<p>The person comes up, they&rsquo;re mostly men,</p>
<p>not always, but mostly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re tentative and they&rsquo;re very polite,</p>
<p>very, very polite.</p>
<p>And they say, I hope I&rsquo;m not bothering you.</p>
<p>Do you mind, you know, do you mind that I say</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not bothering me?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m doing everything I can to not be the guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s bothered by that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who do you think you are?</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the guy that what is famous and now is above that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy.</p>
<p>So you wanna be grateful all the time</p>
<p>when people open up like that.</p>
<p>And so you gotta be alert and on point</p>
<p>to do that properly, like right away.</p>
<p>Because for you, it&rsquo;s five seconds or 10 seconds</p>
<p>or 20 seconds, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But for them, they&rsquo;ve opened up.</p>
<p>And so you can really nail them if you&rsquo;re foolish.</p>
<p>After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?</p>
<p>How do you find yourself again?</p>
<p>Well, that was when I got caught in Twitter traps,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m so burnt out by then from the talk</p>
<p>and the audience interactions and the whole day.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s a new city, it&rsquo;s a new hotel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new 5,000 people, it&rsquo;s a new book chapter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole new horizon of ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s off to another city the next day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so burnt out by then that I&rsquo;m not as good</p>
<p>at controlling my impulses as I might be.</p>
<p>And Twitter was a real catastrophe for that</p>
<p>cause it would hook me and then I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,</p>
<p>I used to call Tammy and say, look,</p>
<p>you have to come and get me, I can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop, I got tired and then I kind of,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s part of a kind of hypomanic focus.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quit, it&rsquo;s like, oh no, I&rsquo;m still writing.</p>
<p>I need to get away from this, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s better to read something, a book.</p>
<p>Fiction, nonfiction.</p>
<p>Fiction, Stephen King.</p>
<p>I was reading a lot of Stephen King</p>
<p>when I was on tour last time, that was good.</p>
<p>I like Stephen King a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great narrative.</p>
<p>Great, and great characterization, you know?</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s a familiarity about Stephen King&rsquo;s</p>
<p>writing too that it&rsquo;s, he writes about people you know.</p>
<p>And so I really found that a relief.</p>
<p>And so that was useful.</p>
<p>And that in order to tolerate this, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or to be able to sustain it,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s take a lot of negotiation</p>
<p>on the part of Tammy and I,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s dragged into this and, you know,</p>
<p>her life is part of this, whatever this is.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s had to find her way and has, for example,</p>
<p>now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.</p>
<p>And she found that she didn&rsquo;t want to be on the tour</p>
<p>this spring, and I was ill again for part of it.</p>
<p>And that made it complicated,</p>
<p>but she went away back home and she came back</p>
<p>and she said, and she was nervous about,</p>
<p>she said, I think I need my own room.</p>
<p>And part of me was not happy with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what do you mean you need your,</p>
<p>like, are we not married anymore?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you need your own room?</p>
<p>And she said, well, you know, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>she has to do exercises because she was really sick</p>
<p>and she has to keep herself in shape.</p>
<p>And she has to have some time to do that.</p>
<p>She does a lot of prayer and meditation</p>
<p>and she needs the time.</p>
<p>And she has her own podcast, which is going quite well.</p>
<p>And she needs the time and I trust her.</p>
<p>And she said, well, I need this in order to continue.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, okay,</p>
<p>if you need this in order to continue, yes.</p>
<p>Because she went away and didn&rsquo;t say, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be on the tour.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this anymore.</p>
<p>She went away and prayed, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>how can I continue to do this?</p>
<p>And that was the answer.</p>
<p>And so she has her own hotel room.</p>
<p>And that was a really good decision on her part.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s very good and getting better all the time</p>
<p>at figuring out what has to happen for her</p>
<p>to make this sustainable.</p>
<p>And all that&rsquo;s been is a plus</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to travel without her.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want her life to be miserable.</p>
<p>And I want her to be fully on board.</p>
<p>And so she has to be properly selfish.</p>
<p>Like everyone does in a relationship.</p>
<p>And you have to, not just that,</p>
<p>this is a weird thing that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And you have to, both you and her have to figure out</p>
<p>how to manage this very intense intellectual,</p>
<p>social journey.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s another element to it too</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t tell you about.</p>
<p>So that was a typical day, but it&rsquo;s missing a big component</p>
<p>because usually we also have a dinner</p>
<p>with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose,</p>
<p>10 to 30 from each country.</p>
<p>Cause I have a network of people who have networks</p>
<p>who are setting me up with key decision makers</p>
<p>in each country.</p>
<p>And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes that&rsquo;s on a day when I don&rsquo;t have a talk,</p>
<p>but sometimes the talks are back to back.</p>
<p>And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.</p>
<p>And then people are showing us exciting things</p>
<p>and tours in the cities and which is all,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a surf fight of wonderful.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, yeah, you have to be there for it.</p>
<p>You have to be present for it mentally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.</p>
<p>How do you get to sleep?</p>
<p>Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.</p>
<p>Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years.</p>
<p>I thought about that a lot too, you know,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t do a really good job of explaining that</p>
<p>while I was ill because it appeared in some sense</p>
<p>that the reason I was ill was because I was taking</p>
<p>benzodiazepines, but that isn&rsquo;t why I was ill.</p>
<p>And then I took them and very low dose.</p>
<p>And I took that for a long time and it helped</p>
<p>whatever was wrong with me.</p>
<p>And it looks like it was an allergy</p>
<p>or maybe multiple allergies.</p>
<p>And then that stopped working.</p>
<p>And so I took a little bit more for about a month</p>
<p>and that made it way worse.</p>
<p>And so then I cut back a lot and then,</p>
<p>then things really got out of hand.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So there was a deeper thing in the Benzo.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>What can you put words to?</p>
<p>Well, I had a lot of immune, well, my daughter,</p>
<p>as everyone knows, has a very reactive immune system.</p>
<p>And Tammy has three immunological conditions,</p>
<p>each of them quite serious.</p>
<p>And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,</p>
<p>which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata</p>
<p>and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared</p>
<p>to be allergy related.</p>
<p>And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.</p>
<p>And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,</p>
<p>cause I also had this proclivity to depression</p>
<p>that was part of my family history.</p>
<p>But I think that was all immunological</p>
<p>as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So one of the things that&rsquo;s happened to me,</p>
<p>I always noticed I really couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>Like I could breathe about one fifth</p>
<p>as much as I sometimes could.</p>
<p>And so I was always short of breath.</p>
<p>And it looks like what that was perhaps was</p>
<p>I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,</p>
<p>which is not pleasant.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hypersympathetic activation,</p>
<p>no parasympathetic activation.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t relax at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an immunological response.</p>
<p>Allergic response, yeah.</p>
<p>So anyways, that was what seemed,</p>
<p>now this, I don&rsquo;t like to talk about this much</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so bloody radical</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like to propagate it,</p>
<p>but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.</p>
<p>My gum disease, which is incurable,</p>
<p>I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,</p>
<p>is completely gone, took three years.</p>
<p>My right eye, which was quite cloudy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cleared up completely.</p>
<p>What else has changed?</p>
<p>Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly kept it off.</p>
<p>I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator</p>
<p>of nutritional science.</p>
<p>I have my skepticism towards the degree</p>
<p>to which it is currently as a science.</p>
<p>Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery</p>
<p>and full of profiteers,</p>
<p>the people that profit of different kinds of diets.</p>
<p>But I should say for me personally,</p>
<p>it does seem that I feel by far the best</p>
<p>when I eat only meat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And I discovered that a long time ago.</p>
<p>First of all.</p>
<p>How did you discover it?</p>
<p>So by, the discovery went like this.</p>
<p>I started listening to ultra marathon runners</p>
<p>about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And they started talking about fat adapted running.</p>
<p>So I first discovered that I don&rsquo;t have to run super fast</p>
<p>to enjoy running.</p>
<p>And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.</p>
<p>So that was like step one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>If I maintain something called the math rule,</p>
<p>which is the pretty low heart rate.</p>
<p>If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast</p>
<p>while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.</p>
<p>Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.</p>
<p>So I got into that.</p>
<p>On top of that, I also, they also fast often.</p>
<p>So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.</p>
<p>You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an optimization of death because you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>when you fast, your body, logically and obviously,</p>
<p>if you think about it biologically is,</p>
<p>well, what is your body scavenge first?</p>
<p>Well, damaged tissue.</p>
<p>So the, and I know the literature on fasting</p>
<p>to some degree, and it&rsquo;s very compelling literature.</p>
<p>If you starve dogs down, I think it&rsquo;s 20% below rats too,</p>
<p>below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, 30%, like it&rsquo;s like 30%, yeah, 30%.</p>
<p>Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things</p>
<p>that make me nervous because I always feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no free lunch that I&rsquo;m gonna pay for it somehow.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,</p>
<p>especially when I eat once a day.</p>
<p>My mind is almost like nervously focused.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an anxiety, but a positive one</p>
<p>or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.</p>
<p>You know, I wonder how much of that&rsquo;s associated with,</p>
<p>well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,</p>
<p>which not that hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert</p>
<p>in that situation, right?</p>
<p>Biologically speaking, because you&rsquo;re in hunting mode,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.</p>
<p>And God only knows maybe human beings</p>
<p>should be in hunting mode all the time.</p>
<p>Often, but we don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So I wonder if it has a stress on the system</p>
<p>that long term causes the system to get sick.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>
<p>It seems in the case of fasting, not.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, I discovered that</p>
<p>the thing I enjoy, I just don&rsquo;t enjoy eating fat as much.</p>
<p>So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diet.</p>
<p>So I just discovered through that process,</p>
<p>if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,</p>
<p>I just feel a lot of the things</p>
<p>that make me feel weird about food,</p>
<p>like a little groggy or like full or just whatever,</p>
<p>the aspects of food that I don&rsquo;t enjoy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not there with meat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still able to enjoy company.</p>
<p>And when I eat once a day and eat meat,</p>
<p>I said, at least in Texas,</p>
<p>you could still have all the merriment of,</p>
<p>you have dinner with friends.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t do the, you have a very serious thing</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s health benefits</p>
<p>that you are very serious about.</p>
<p>For me, I can still drink whiskey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still do the things that add a little bit of spice</p>
<p>into the thing.</p>
<p>Now, when you completely remove the spice,</p>
<p>it does become more difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s more difficult socially.</p>
<p>And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,</p>
<p>although she might be able to eat non aged beef.</p>
<p>And that makes traveling complicated too, right?</p>
<p>Because, well, for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, really, that&rsquo;s all you can eat?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, celeries.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s a form of craziness, but.</p>
<p>If we can return to actually the thing</p>
<p>you were talking about,</p>
<p>when you were thinking about a question before the lecture.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about thinking in general.</p>
<p>This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller</p>
<p>think a lot about is thinking how to think.</p>
<p>How do you think through an idea?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>We tried to work that out with this essay app</p>
<p>that my son and I have developed,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re gonna write,</p>
<p>the first question is, well, what should I write about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the app?</p>
<p>Essay.app.</p>
<p>And, well, the first question is, well, what bugs you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s bugging you?</p>
<p>This is such a cool thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where is my destiny?</p>
<p>Well, what bothers you?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where your destiny is.</p>
<p>Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.</p>
<p>Why did those things bother you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things you could be bothered by.</p>
<p>Like a million things, man.</p>
<p>But some things grip you.</p>
<p>They bug you.</p>
<p>And they might make you resentful and bitter,</p>
<p>because they bug you so much.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re your things, man.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got you.</p>
<p>So then I look for a question</p>
<p>that I would like the answer to,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t, and I would really like the answer to it,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t assume I already have the answer,</p>
<p>because I would actually really like to have the answer.</p>
<p>So if I could get a better answer, great.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a prayer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, here&rsquo;s a mystery.</p>
<p>I would like to delve into it further.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s humility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s a mystery,</p>
<p>which means I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would like to delve into it further,</p>
<p>which means I don&rsquo;t know enough already.</p>
<p>And then comes the revelation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, what&rsquo;s a revelation?</p>
<p>Well, if you ask yourself a question, it&rsquo;s a real question.</p>
<p>Do you get an answer or not?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, yeah,</p>
<p>thoughts start to appear in your head.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>From somewhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, from somewhere.</p>
<p>Where do they come from?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense?</p>
<p>Depends on what you&rsquo;re aiming at.</p>
<p>Depends on the question.</p>
<p>No, no, it does to some degree.</p>
<p>It depends on your intent.</p>
<p>So imagine that your intent is to make things better.</p>
<p>Then maybe they come from the place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to make things better.</p>
<p>Maybe your intent is to make things worse.</p>
<p>Then they come from hell.</p>
<p>And you think, not really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re so sure about that, are you?</p>
<p>Is your intent conscious?</p>
<p>Like, are you able to introspect with the intent?</p>
<p>Conscious and habitual, right?</p>
<p>Because as you practise something consciously,</p>
<p>it becomes habitual.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I sit down before I do a lecture,</p>
<p>I think, okay, what&rsquo;s the goal here?</p>
<p>To do the best job I can.</p>
<p>To what end?</p>
<p>Well, people are coming here not for political issues.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming here because they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to make their lives better.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are we doing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re conducting a joint investigation</p>
<p>into the nature of that which makes life better.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s my role?</p>
<p>To do as good a job about that as possible.</p>
<p>What state of mind do I have to be in?</p>
<p>Am I annoyed about the theatre?</p>
<p>Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people</p>
<p>have showed up at substantial expense and trouble</p>
<p>to come and listen to me talk?</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m not in that state of mind,</p>
<p>I think, well, maybe I need something to eat</p>
<p>or maybe I need to talk to someone</p>
<p>because ingratitude is no place to start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.</p>
<p>And so that orientation has to be there.</p>
<p>And then I, is it conscious?</p>
<p>All this is conscious.</p>
<p>What am I serving?</p>
<p>The highest good I can conceptualize.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I have some sense, but I don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>in the final analysis, which is why the investigation</p>
<p>is being conducted.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s doing it?</p>
<p>Me, whoever I&rsquo;m communing with, and the audience.</p>
<p>And so I try to get myself and I chase everybody away</p>
<p>for that, it&rsquo;s like I have to do that by myself.</p>
<p>Are you writing stuff down?</p>
<p>Yes, at that point, I just make point notes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s usually about maybe 30 notes.</p>
<p>But then I, on stage, I never refer to them.</p>
<p>And I often don&rsquo;t even use the structure that I laid out.</p>
<p>Kind of an interesting thing.</p>
<p>From where do powerful phrases come from?</p>
<p>Do you have a, do you try to encapsulate an idea</p>
<p>into a sentence or two?</p>
<p>Well, when I talk, and I&rsquo;ve practiced this since,</p>
<p>consciously, since 1985, I try to feel</p>
<p>and see if the words are stepping stones</p>
<p>or foundation stones, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, is this solid?</p>
<p>Is this word solid?</p>
<p>Is this phrase solid?</p>
<p>Is this sentence solid?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real sense of fundamental foundation</p>
<p>under each word.</p>
<p>And I suppose people ask me if I pray.</p>
<p>And I would say, I pray before every word.</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re asking questions,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re very clear headed and present</p>
<p>in your ability to ask questions and inquire.</p>
<p>So how do you do that?</p>
<p>So first of all, I&rsquo;m worried that my mind</p>
<p>easily gets trapped when I step on a word</p>
<p>and I know it&rsquo;s unstable.</p>
<p>You kind of realize that you don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>the definitions of many words you use.</p>
<p>And that can be debilitating.</p>
<p>So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you get trapped.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be obsessional.</p>
<p>Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence</p>
<p>will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Well, you know, neurologically.</p>
<p>And then everything else just explodes.</p>
<p>Your big picture idea explodes</p>
<p>and you lost yourself in the minutiae.</p>
<p>Well, neurologically, there&rsquo;s a production center</p>
<p>and an editing center.</p>
<p>And those can be separately affected by strokes.</p>
<p>And so often when people are writing or talking,</p>
<p>they try to activate both at the same time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so people will try to write an essay</p>
<p>and get every sentence right in the first draft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big mistake.</p>
<p>And so then you might say, well,</p>
<p>how can you be careful with your words, but carefree?</p>
<p>And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?</p>
<p>While in the conversation we&rsquo;re having,</p>
<p>you have an orientation structure.</p>
<p>You want to be prepared.</p>
<p>You want to be attentive.</p>
<p>Then you want to have an interesting conversation.</p>
<p>And you want to have the kind of interesting conversation</p>
<p>that other people want to listen to.</p>
<p>That will be good for them in some manner.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s pretty good frame.</p>
<p>And then you kind of scour your heart</p>
<p>and you think, is that really what you want?</p>
<p>Are you after fame or after notoriety?</p>
<p>Are you after money?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not optimal,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not willing to admit them, right?</p>
<p>And so they can contaminate you.</p>
<p>So you want to be decontaminated.</p>
<p>So you have the right trip, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And so you have to put yourself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a meditative practice.</p>
<p>You have to put yourself in the right receptive position</p>
<p>with the right goal in mind.</p>
<p>Then you can,</p>
<p>and I think you can get better and better at this,</p>
<p>then you can trust what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>You know, so for example, before I came here,</p>
<p>I mean, I presume you have a reason</p>
<p>for doing the podcast with me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reason?</p>
<p>I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.</p>
<p>So the reason has evolved.</p>
<p>One of the reasons is I&rsquo;ve listened to you</p>
<p>for quite a long time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve become a one way friend</p>
<p>and I have many one way friends.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends don&rsquo;t even know I exist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big fan of podcasts and audio books.</p>
<p>Actually, most of my friends are dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>The writers.</p>
<p>The definition of a reader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of dead, great dead friends.</p>
<p>So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose,</p>
<p>and have a conversation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this kind of puzzle</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been longing to solve.</p>
<p>The same reason I went to Ukraine</p>
<p>of asking this question of myself, who am I?</p>
<p>And what was this part of the world?</p>
<p>What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?</p>
<p>That I lost so much of my family there</p>
<p>and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place.</p>
<p>Now that place includes the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and it includes Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It includes Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>includes these big powerful leaders</p>
<p>and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty,</p>
<p>the power of the dream, but were also the torture</p>
<p>that was forced onto them</p>
<p>through different governmental institutions.</p>
<p>And you are somebody that seemed from some angle</p>
<p>to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.</p>
<p>And not in some sort of historical sense,</p>
<p>but in a deeply psychological human sense.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What is that, will it repeat again?</p>
<p>In what way is it repeating again?</p>
<p>And how can we stop it?</p>
<p>And so. That&rsquo;s the crucial issue.</p>
<p>I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,</p>
<p>pull at the thread of that curiosity.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m an engineer, you&rsquo;re a psychologist,</p>
<p>both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits.</p>
<p>And a talk with various levels of eloquence</p>
<p>about sort of the shadows that these,</p>
<p>that history casts on us.</p>
<p>And so that was one.</p>
<p>And also the psychology,</p>
<p>I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by the human mind</p>
<p>until I discovered artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>the fact that I could program and make a robot move.</p>
<p>And until I discovered that magic,</p>
<p>I thought I wanted to understand the human mind</p>
<p>by being psychiatrist, by talking to people,</p>
<p>by to talk therapy, psychotherapy.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got the best of both worlds</p>
<p>because you get to talk to people and you get build robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.</p>
<p>That I felt like by building the thing,</p>
<p>can you start to try to understand it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities.</p>
<p>So like my particular one is, has to do with,</p>
<p>I learned by building.</p>
<p>I think through a thing by building it.</p>
<p>And programming is a wonderful thing</p>
<p>because it allows you to like build a little toy example.</p>
<p>So in the same way you can do a little thought experiment,</p>
<p>programming allows you to create a thought experiment</p>
<p>in action, it can move, it can live, it can,</p>
<p>and then you can ask questions of it.</p>
<p>So all of those, because of my interest in Freud and Young,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also in different ways,</p>
<p>have delved deeply into humanity, the human psyche</p>
<p>through the perspective of those psychologists.</p>
<p>So for all those reasons, I thought our paths were crossed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s quite a frame for a discussion, right?</p>
<p>You had all sorts of reasons, and then you think,</p>
<p>well, are you just letting the conversation</p>
<p>go where it will?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, not exactly.</p>
<p>You spent all this time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like this came about by accident,</p>
<p>this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.</p>
<p>And so all of that provides the implicit substructure</p>
<p>for the play in the conversation.</p>
<p>And if you have that implicit, here&rsquo;s another way,</p>
<p>this is very much worth knowing is,</p>
<p>if you get the implicit structure of perception right,</p>
<p>everything becomes a game.</p>
<p>And not only that, a game you wanna play,</p>
<p>and maybe in the final analysis,</p>
<p>a game you&rsquo;d wanna play forever.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s obviously a distant beckoning ideal,</p>
<p>but we know only games need rules, or there&rsquo;s no play.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give, now that we know the frame,</p>
<p>to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,</p>
<p>how to think about this world,</p>
<p>how to be a good engineer,</p>
<p>how to be a good human being, from what you know about me.</p>
<p>Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serious business, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of that,</p>
<p>to circle back to the beginning, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that willingness to gaze into the abyss,</p>
<p>which is obviously what you were doing</p>
<p>when you went to Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gazing into the abyss that makes you better.</p>
<p>The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche&rsquo;s ideas,</p>
<p>not as differentiated as it became,</p>
<p>sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed</p>
<p>towards the abyss, and then you&rsquo;re traumatized.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.</p>
<p>The more it&rsquo;s voluntary, the more transformative it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of that idea about facing death and hell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, can you tolerate death and hell?</p>
<p>And the answer is, this terrible answer is,</p>
<p>yes, to the degree that you&rsquo;re willing to do it voluntarily.</p>
<p>And then you might ask, well,</p>
<p>why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m innocent.</p>
<p>And then the answer to that is,</p>
<p>even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed</p>
<p>to the highest good.</p>
<p>Even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed to the highest good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting distinction.</p>
<p>Voluntary suffering.</p>
<p>Voluntary, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why the central Christian doctrine is,</p>
<p>pick up your cross and follow me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m speaking, not in religious terms saying that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking as a psychologist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>in the last 100 years is voluntary exposure to that</p>
<p>which freezes and terrifies you</p>
<p>in measured proportions is curative.</p>
<p>So a form of, at least in part,</p>
<p>involuntary suffering is depression.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a man who has suffered in this way.</p>
<p>Perhaps continue to suffer in this way.</p>
<p>How do you find a way out?</p>
<p>The first thing I do as a clinician,</p>
<p>if someone comes to me and says they&rsquo;re depressed</p>
<p>is ask myself a question.</p>
<p>Well, what does this person mean by that?</p>
<p>So I have to find out like,</p>
<p>because maybe they&rsquo;re not depressed,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re hyper anxious,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re obsessional.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s various forms of powerful negative emotion.</p>
<p>So they need to be differentiated.</p>
<p>But then the next question you have to ask is,</p>
<p>well, are you depressed?</p>
<p>Or do you have a terrible life?</p>
<p>Or is it some combination of the two?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re depressed, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a terrible life.</p>
<p>You have friends, you have family,</p>
<p>you have an intimate relationship,</p>
<p>you have a job or a career,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about as educated as you should be</p>
<p>given your intelligence,</p>
<p>use your time outside of work wisely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not beholden to alcohol or other temptations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re engaged in the community in some fundamental sense,</p>
<p>and all that&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Now, if you have all that and you&rsquo;re feeling really awful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either ill or you&rsquo;re depressed.</p>
<p>And so then sometimes there&rsquo;s a biochemical route</p>
<p>to that treatment of that.</p>
<p>My experience has been as a clinician is if you&rsquo;re depressed,</p>
<p>but you have a life and you take an antidepressant,</p>
<p>it will probably help you a lot.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you&rsquo;re not depressed.</p>
<p>Exactly, you just have a terrible life.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>You have no relationship, your family&rsquo;s a mess,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got no friends, you&rsquo;ve got no plan, you&rsquo;ve got no job.</p>
<p>You use your time outside of work</p>
<p>not only badly but destructively.</p>
<p>You have a drug or alcohol habit</p>
<p>or some other vice, pornography addiction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely unengaged in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>You have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you</p>
<p>in your current mode of being or you move forward.</p>
<p>And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s depression per se,</p>
<p>well, like I said, there&rsquo;s sometimes a biochemical route,</p>
<p>a nutritional route, there&rsquo;s ways that can be addressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably physiological if you&rsquo;re, at least in part,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re depressed, but you have an okay life.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s conceptual.</p>
<p>You can turn to dreams sometimes to help people.</p>
<p>Cause dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.</p>
<p>And if your person is a real good dreamer</p>
<p>and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.</p>
<p>But that seems to be only true for more creative people.</p>
<p>And for the people who just have a terrible life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, you have a terrible life.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s pick a front.</p>
<p>How about you need a friend?</p>
<p>Like one sort of friend.</p>
<p>Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have the person show me.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do it for a sec.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this, hi, I&rsquo;m Jordan, right?</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>And then they can&rsquo;t even get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.</p>
<p>Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish, you know?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these elementary social skills</p>
<p>that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,</p>
<p>you learned when you were like three</p>
<p>and sometimes people have, I had lots of clients</p>
<p>to whom no one ever paid any attention.</p>
<p>And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.</p>
<p>And some of that was just listening</p>
<p>because they had 10,000 hours of conversations</p>
<p>they never had with anyone.</p>
<p>And they were all tangled up in their head.</p>
<p>And they had to just, one client in particular,</p>
<p>I worked with this person for 15 years.</p>
<p>And what she wanted from me</p>
<p>was for me just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes.</p>
<p>It was very hard for me.</p>
<p>And to just tell me what had happened to her.</p>
<p>And then what happened at the end of the conversation,</p>
<p>then I could discuss a bit with her.</p>
<p>And then as we progressed through the years,</p>
<p>the amount of time that we spent in discussion</p>
<p>increased in proportion in the sessions</p>
<p>until by the time we stopped seeing each other,</p>
<p>when my clinical practice collapsed,</p>
<p>we were talking about 80% of the time.</p>
<p>But she literally,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d never been attended to properly ever.</p>
<p>And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t been subjected to those flaming swords</p>
<p>that separated the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>And so you can do that in therapy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening and you&rsquo;re depressed,</p>
<p>I would say if you can&rsquo;t find a therapist,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s getting harder and harder</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually become illegal to be a therapist now</p>
<p>because you have to agree with your clients,</p>
<p>which is a terrible thing to do with them.</p>
<p>Just like it&rsquo;s terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.</p>
<p>You could do the self authoring program online</p>
<p>because it helps you write an autobiography.</p>
<p>And so if you have memories</p>
<p>that are more than 18 months old</p>
<p>that bother you when you think them up,</p>
<p>part of you is locked inside that.</p>
<p>An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a metaphorical way of thinking about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it still has emotional significance.</p>
<p>So you can write about your past experiences,</p>
<p>but I would say wait for at least 18 months</p>
<p>if something bad has happened to you.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again</p>
<p>by encountering it.</p>
<p>You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an analysis of faults and virtues,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the present authoring.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a guided writing exercise</p>
<p>that helps you make a future plan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s young men who do that could go to college,</p>
<p>young men who do that, 90 minutes,</p>
<p>just the future authoring, 90 minutes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re 50% less likely to drop out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>
<p>So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud</p>
<p>that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.</p>
<p>Or you said isolate, make a friend.</p>
<p>Oh man, sometimes the first step is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Oh my God, sometimes it&rsquo;s way worse than that.</p>
<p>Like I had clients who were so depressed</p>
<p>they literally couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s their first step?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, can you sit up once today?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?</p>
<p>Like you just, you scale back the dragon</p>
<p>till you find one that&rsquo;s conquerable</p>
<p>that moves you forward.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rubric for life.</p>
<p>Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you a little bit of goal.</p>
<p>Commensurate with the struggle.</p>
<p>But the plus side of that,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s, you think that God, that&rsquo;s depressing.</p>
<p>You mean I have to start by sitting up?</p>
<p>Well you do if you can&rsquo;t sit up.</p>
<p>But the plus side of that is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Pareto distribution issue</p>
<p>is that aggregates exponentially increase</p>
<p>and failures do too by the way.</p>
<p>But aggregates exponentially increase.</p>
<p>So once you start the ball rolling</p>
<p>it can get zipping along pretty good.</p>
<p>This person that I talked about</p>
<p>was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe</p>
<p>when we first met just talking</p>
<p>even though I was her therapist.</p>
<p>But by the end she was doing standup comedy.</p>
<p>So, you know, it took years,</p>
<p>but still most people won&rsquo;t do standup comedy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite the bloody achievement.</p>
<p>She would read her poetry on stage too.</p>
<p>So for someone who was petrified into paralysis</p>
<p>by social anxiety and who had to start very small,</p>
<p>it was a hell of an accomplishment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it all starts with one step.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people in high school?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given, a lot of people look up to you</p>
<p>for advice, for strength,</p>
<p>for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.</p>
<p>Take on some responsibility.</p>
<p>Do something for other people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something for yourself while you&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t know it, for sure.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re a community across time.</p>
<p>Find something to serve.</p>
<p>Somebody to help.</p>
<p>Someone to help, a job to, find a job,</p>
<p>do your best with the customers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be above your job.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get an entry level job when you&rsquo;re a kid</p>
<p>or what else would you want?</p>
<p>You wanna be the boss?</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>You could be the boss of your job.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re working in a grocery store</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re working in a convenience store,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re not working for terrified tyrants,</p>
<p>you can be nice to the customers.</p>
<p>You can develop your social skills.</p>
<p>You can learn how to handle boss employee relationship.</p>
<p>You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.</p>
<p>Like you can learn in an entry level job, man.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you take an entry level job</p>
<p>and you learn and it&rsquo;s a reasonably decent place,</p>
<p>you will not be in an entry level job for long</p>
<p>because everyone who&rsquo;s competent</p>
<p>is desperate for competent people.</p>
<p>And if you go and show yourself as competent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a trial period.</p>
<p>But if you go show yourself as competent,</p>
<p>all sorts of doors you didn&rsquo;t even know were there</p>
<p>will start opening like mad.</p>
<p>So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, for discipline, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>I said in one of the chapters,</p>
<p>my books is focused on putting your house in order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, how do you start?</p>
<p>Make your bed.</p>
<p>You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life</p>
<p>before I made my bed regularly in the morning.</p>
<p>Most of my life was pretty good order,</p>
<p>but that was one thing I didn&rsquo;t have in order.</p>
<p>My clothes in my closet as well, all that&rsquo;s in order.</p>
<p>Not all of it, I&rsquo;m cleaning out some drawers right now,</p>
<p>but look around and see what bugs you in your room.</p>
<p>Just look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m in my room.</p>
<p>Do I like this room?</p>
<p>No, it bugs me.</p>
<p>Okay, why?</p>
<p>Well, the paint&rsquo;s peeling there and it&rsquo;s dusty there</p>
<p>and the carpet&rsquo;s dirty and that corner&rsquo;s kind of ugly</p>
<p>and the light there isn&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p>And my clothes closet&rsquo;s a mess,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t even like to open it.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a lot of problems.</p>
<p>That sucks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>Pick something and fix it.</p>
<p>Something that bugs you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not too much.</p>
<p>So the rule is pick something you know would make,</p>
<p>pick a problem, pick a solution to it</p>
<p>that you know would help, that you could do,</p>
<p>that you would do.</p>
<p>So you have to negotiate with yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I won&rsquo;t clean up this room.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in here for 10 years and I&rsquo;ve never cleaned it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, obviously that&rsquo;s too big a dragon for you.</p>
<p>Would you clean one drawer?</p>
<p>Find out.</p>
<p>And so imagine now you wanna be happy</p>
<p>when you open that drawer and you think,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, is it?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s your sock drawer,</p>
<p>which I cleaned up in my room the other day.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re gonna open that every morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like 30 seconds of your life every day.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s three minutes a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 12 minutes a month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two hours a year.</p>
<p>So maybe your life is made out of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got 16 hours a day.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure this out.</p>
<p>Five, 12 in an hour, 12 in an hour, 144 in 12 hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say 200, 205 minute chunks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your life.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math</p>
<p>how many five minute chunks there are in a day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s pretty accurate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approximately right.</p>
<p>So you got 205 minute chunks and they repeat.</p>
<p>A lot of them repeat.</p>
<p>So if you get every one of those right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trivial, right, who cares</p>
<p>what my sock drawer looks like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, fair enough, man, but that&rsquo;s your life.</p>
<p>The things you repeat every day, the mundane things.</p>
<p>Think I could get all those mundane things right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like now all the mundane is in place.</p>
<p>Now you can play because all the mundane is in place.</p>
<p>And this is actually true.</p>
<p>So with children, imagine you want your children to play.</p>
<p>Well, play is very fragile neurologically.</p>
<p>Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.</p>
<p>So everything has to be in order.</p>
<p>Everything has to be a walled garden</p>
<p>before the children will play.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>So you put everything in order and you think,</p>
<p>oh my God, now I&rsquo;m tyrannized by this order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, you aren&rsquo;t, not if it&rsquo;s voluntary.</p>
<p>And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.</p>
<p>And so then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you get all these things in order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, look at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some room to play here.</p>
<p>And then maybe you&rsquo;re not depressed.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s often not that simple.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Try putting your room in order, perfect order.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a really powerful way</p>
<p>to think about those five minute chunks.</p>
<p>Just get one of them right in a day.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,</p>
<p>your life is in order.</p>
<p>You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.</p>
<p>So a lot of them would come home from work,</p>
<p>the guys, and their wives would meet them at the door</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be a fight right away.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s a clash there</p>
<p>because he comes home and he&rsquo;s tired and hungry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worked all day and he&rsquo;s hoping that, you know,</p>
<p>he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home,</p>
<p>but then the wife is at home</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been with the kids all day</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s tired and hungry and she&rsquo;s hoping</p>
<p>that when he comes home, he&rsquo;ll show her some appreciation</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s happened today.</p>
<p>And then they clash and then they both have problems</p>
<p>to discuss because they&rsquo;ve had their troubles</p>
<p>during the day.</p>
<p>And so then every time they get together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not like it&rsquo;s a bit of a fight for 20 minutes</p>
<p>and then the whole evening is screwed.</p>
<p>And so then you think, okay, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s knock and the door will open.</p>
<p>Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,</p>
<p>but you have to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>So now this is the deal.</p>
<p>You treat yourself properly.</p>
<p>You imagine coming home</p>
<p>and it goes the way you want and need it to go.</p>
<p>Okay, what does that look like?</p>
<p>You get to have it, but you have to know what it is.</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>And you think, okay, I want to come home.</p>
<p>I want to be happy about coming home.</p>
<p>I come home, I open the door.</p>
<p>I say, hello, honey, I&rsquo;m home.</p>
<p>My wife says, hi, it&rsquo;s so nice to hear your voice.</p>
<p>She comes up, she says, hi, dear.</p>
<p>She gives you a hug.</p>
<p>She says, how was your day?</p>
<p>And you say, well, we&rsquo;ll sit and talk about that.</p>
<p>How was your day?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll sit and talk about that.</p>
<p>Do you need something to eat?</p>
<p>Probably, let&rsquo;s go sit and talk about our day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay, that sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>Might not be perfect,</p>
<p>but sounds a hell of a lot better</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>So how about we go talk to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go talk to your wife and say,</p>
<p>okay, this is what&rsquo;s happening when I come home.</p>
<p>I would like it to be better.</p>
<p>What would you like to have happened</p>
<p>if you could have what you wanted?</p>
<p>And so she sits down and she thinks,</p>
<p>okay, if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?</p>
<p>And then now you got two visions and you say,</p>
<p>well, what would you like?</p>
<p>And you listen and she says, what would you like?</p>
<p>And you tell her, and then you think,</p>
<p>okay, now how can we bring these visions together?</p>
<p>So not only do we both get what we want,</p>
<p>but because we&rsquo;ve brought them together,</p>
<p>we even get more than we want.</p>
<p>Well, who wouldn&rsquo;t agree to that</p>
<p>unless they were aiming down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a compromise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a union of ideals that even makes a better ideal.</p>
<p>And then you get to come home.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another rule that goes along with that,</p>
<p>which is, please, dear, have the grace</p>
<p>to allow me to do this stupidly and badly</p>
<p>while I learn at least 20 times.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you the same leeway,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll practice stupidly for 20 times</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>And then maybe we&rsquo;ll get it right</p>
<p>for the next 10,000 times, right?</p>
<p>And you can do that with your whole life.</p>
<p>And you can do that with your kids</p>
<p>and you can do that with your family.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not easy, but you can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier than the alternative.</p>
<p>Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>How do you find on that topic the love of your life?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I was asked that multiple times on my tour,</p>
<p>three times in a row, in fact,</p>
<p>because we ask people to use this Slido gadget.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a popular question?</p>
<p>To vary.</p>
<p>It always came up to the top.</p>
<p>And I got asked that three times in a row</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have a good answer.</p>
<p>And then I thought, why don&rsquo;t I have a good answer?</p>
<p>I thought, oh, I know why.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s a stupid question.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the right question.</p>
<p>How do I make myself into the perfect date?</p>
<p>You answer that question</p>
<p>and you will not have any problem</p>
<p>answering the previous question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what do I want in a partner?</p>
<p>If I offered everything I could to a partner</p>
<p>who would I be?</p>
<p>You work on that.</p>
<p>Ask that question.</p>
<p>Just ask.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, okay.</p>
<p>I have to be the person that women would want.</p>
<p>Okay, what do they want?</p>
<p>Clean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad start.</p>
<p>Reasonably good physical shape.</p>
<p>So healthy, productive,</p>
<p>generous, honest,</p>
<p>willing to delay gratification.</p>
<p>So you dance with a woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s she doing?</p>
<p>What are you two doing?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a pattern.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s patterns happening around you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the music, patterns, patterns of being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the music.</p>
<p>Now, can you align yourself</p>
<p>with the patterns of being gracefully?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s checking out.</p>
<p>And then can you do that with her?</p>
<p>And then can you do that in a playful</p>
<p>and attentive manner and keep your bloody hands</p>
<p>to yourself for at least a minute?</p>
<p>And so can you dance in a playful manner?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can go through this in your imagination</p>
<p>and you know, you&rsquo;ll know, you know.</p>
<p>And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?</p>
<p>And the answer is usually, man,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.</p>
<p>But the harder you work on offering other people</p>
<p>what they need and want,</p>
<p>the more people will line up to play with you.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how can I be the best partner possible?</p>
<p>And then you think, well, if I do that,</p>
<p>people will just take advantage of me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the non naive objection, right?</p>
<p>Because the naive person is saying, well, I&rsquo;ll be good</p>
<p>and everyone will treat me right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cynic says, no, I&rsquo;ll be good</p>
<p>and someone will take me out.</p>
<p>And then you think, well,</p>
<p>what do you do about that objection?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, you factor that in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re supposed to be, what is it?</p>
<p>As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I know you&rsquo;re full of snakes.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>Maybe I know it more than you do, but we&rsquo;ll play anyways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the risk anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, voluntarily, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and what&rsquo;s so cool about that</p>
<p>is that even though the person you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s real, you will evoke the best in them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true even, I&rsquo;ve dealt with people</p>
<p>who are pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic</p>
<p>and sometimes dangerously so.</p>
<p>And you tread very lightly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with someone like that,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re intoxicated.</p>
<p>And even then your best bet is that alert trust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only, it&rsquo;s the fact that the only thing I know</p>
<p>that I had one client who was a paranoid,</p>
<p>he was paranoid psychopath.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad combination.</p>
<p>He was a bad guy, man.</p>
<p>He had like four restraining orders on him</p>
<p>and restraining orders don&rsquo;t work on the sort of people</p>
<p>that you put restraining orders on.</p>
<p>And he used to be harassed now and then by a bureaucrat</p>
<p>in a bank with delusions of power.</p>
<p>And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out</p>
<p>to me when I was talking to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m going to be your worst nightmare.</p>
<p>And he meant it and he would do it.</p>
<p>He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance</p>
<p>that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt</p>
<p>and paranoid people are hyper acute.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re watching you for any sign of deceit</p>
<p>or manipulation and they&rsquo;re really good at it.</p>
<p>Cause like they&rsquo;re 100%, that&rsquo;s what paranoia is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% focus on that.</p>
<p>And even under those circumstances,</p>
<p>if you step carefully enough, you can,</p>
<p>maybe you can avoid the ax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing to know if you ever meet someone</p>
<p>truly dangerous.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I believe in that, that being fragile, nevertheless,</p>
<p>taking that leap of trust towards another person,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re dangerous,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re dangerous.</p>
<p>If you care, if there&rsquo;s something there in those hills</p>
<p>you want to find, then that&rsquo;s probably the only way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find is taking that risk.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s speak to this very point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many layers to this book.</p>
<p>We could talk about it forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.</p>
<p>But there is sort of one of the themes captured</p>
<p>in the few ways that was described to the book</p>
<p>is that line between good and evil</p>
<p>that runs through every human being.</p>
<p>As he writes, the line dividing good and evil</p>
<p>cuts through the heart of every human being.</p>
<p>During the life of any heart,</p>
<p>this line keeps changing place.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil,</p>
<p>and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space</p>
<p>for good to flourish.</p>
<p>One and the same human being is, at various ages,</p>
<p>under various circumstances,</p>
<p>a totally different human being.</p>
<p>At times he&rsquo;s close to being a devil,</p>
<p>at times the sainthood.</p>
<p>But his name doesn&rsquo;t change,</p>
<p>and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.</p>
<p>What do you think about this line?</p>
<p>What do you think about this thing</p>
<p>where we talked about if you give somebody a chance,</p>
<p>you actually bring out the best in them?</p>
<p>What do you think about this other aspect</p>
<p>that throughout time that line shifts inside each person</p>
<p>and you get to define that shift?</p>
<p>What do you think about this line?</p>
<p>Are we all capable of evil?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the cosmic drama,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Satan versus Christ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, who&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not about you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking just as a psychologist</p>
<p>or as a literary critic.</p>
<p>Those are characters, at least they&rsquo;re that.</p>
<p>Well, are they human characters?</p>
<p>Well, obviously.</p>
<p>Well, are they archetypal human characters?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, is the world a story?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>But the way stories are often told</p>
<p>is the characters embody a stable.</p>
<p>Those are unsophisticated, not great literature though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare in great literature.</p>
<p>What you have in great literature generally</p>
<p>is the internal drama, right?</p>
<p>And as the literature becomes more pop, I would say,</p>
<p>the characters are more unitary.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real bad guy and he&rsquo;s all bad</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a real good guy and he&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not as interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as sophisticated.</p>
<p>When you reach Dostoevskian heights in literary representation</p>
<p>or Shakespearean heights, you can identify with the villain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when literature really reaches its pinnacle</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>And also the characters change throughout.</p>
<p>They shift throughout.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unpredictable throughout.</p>
<p>Taking the speaking of Russian more seriously recently.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gotten to talk to translators of Dostoevsk and Tolstoy</p>
<p>and Cherkov and those kinds of folks.</p>
<p>And you get the, one of the mistakes that translators made</p>
<p>with Dostoevsky for the longest time</p>
<p>is they would, quote unquote, fix the chaotic mess</p>
<p>that is Dostoevsky because there was a sense</p>
<p>like he was too rushed in his writing.</p>
<p>It seemed like there was tangents</p>
<p>that had nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And what they realize that is, that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually crafted that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like editing James Joyce,</p>
<p>like Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake or something</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>They realize that that is the magic of it.</p>
<p>That captures the humanity of these characters,</p>
<p>that they are unpredictable.</p>
<p>They change throughout time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of contradictions.</p>
<p>On which point I gotta ask, is there a case to be made</p>
<p>that Brothers Karamazov is the greatest book I&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is a case to be made for that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, is it better than Crime and Punishment?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Why do you, I&rsquo;m not arguing with it.</p>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>Well, every book is a person.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are inside that book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an amazing book.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, some books are defined</p>
<p>by your personal relationship with them.</p>
<p>That one was definitive, and I almost graduated to that one</p>
<p>because for the longest time,</p>
<p>The Idiot was my favorite book of all,</p>
<p>because I identified with the ideas</p>
<p>represented by Prince Mishkin.</p>
<p>I also identified.</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>To Prince Mishkin as a human being.</p>
<p>The holy fool.</p>
<p>The fool, yeah, because the world kind of,</p>
<p>my whole life still kind of sees me,</p>
<p>saw me in my perception.</p>
<p>My narrow perception is kind of the fool.</p>
<p>And I, different from the interpretation</p>
<p>that a lot of people take of this book,</p>
<p>I see him as a kind of hero to be.</p>
<p>Oh, definitely.</p>
<p>To be a naive, quote unquote, fool,</p>
<p>but really just a naive optimist,</p>
<p>and naive in the best possible way.</p>
<p>I do believe that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s childlike?</p>
<p>Yeah, childlike is a better.</p>
<p>So naive is usually seen as.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s childish, naive.</p>
<p>Yeah, but childlike.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why no one enters the kingdom of heaven</p>
<p>unless they become like a child.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Prince Mishkin.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky knew that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why he liked The Idiot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>See, I think I like Crime and Punishment</p>
<p>because while you identified with Mishkin,</p>
<p>I think I identified more with Raskolnikov</p>
<p>because I was tempted by a Luciferian intellect,</p>
<p>you know, in a manner very similar</p>
<p>to the manner he was tempted.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think you can make a case</p>
<p>that the Brothers Karamazov is Dostoevsky&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crowning achievement.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something, man.</p>
<p>He ruined literature for me.</p>
<p>Because everything else just felt insipid afterwards.</p>
<p>Not everything.</p>
<p>I found some books that in my experience</p>
<p>hit that pinnacle.</p>
<p>The Master and Margarita.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a deadly book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that I think four times,</p>
<p>and I still, there&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s unbelievably deep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Nikos Kazantzakis, a Greek writer.</p>
<p>Some of his books are,</p>
<p>his writing is amazing as well.</p>
<p>Did you ever connect with the literary,</p>
<p>like existentialist Camus or people like Hermann Hesse</p>
<p>or even Kafka?</p>
<p>Did you ever connect with those?</p>
<p>To the same degree?</p>
<p>Yeah, to the same.</p>
<p>Enough to be an influence.</p>
<p>You know, you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense</p>
<p>not to encounters a great dead friend and fail to learn.</p>
<p>No, and I mean, I tried to separate the wheat</p>
<p>from the chaff when I read.</p>
<p>You know, and I read all the great clinicians,</p>
<p>all of them, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Those who are foremost in the pantheon.</p>
<p>And I tried to pull out what I could,</p>
<p>and that was a lot.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from Freud.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from Rogers.</p>
<p>And I learned a lot from, well,</p>
<p>from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p>for this Peterson Academy.</p>
<p>This is coming up in January.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;ll be them together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re weaving, I mean.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about doing them together.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a good idea.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna steal that idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You often weave them together really masterfully</p>
<p>because there is religious in the broad sense</p>
<p>of that word, themes throughout the writing.</p>
<p>Throughout the writing of both.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s uncanny parallelisms</p>
<p>in their writing and their lives.</p>
<p>So, and Dostoevsky&rsquo;s deeper than Nietzsche,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because he was a writer of fiction.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is almost a character in a Dostoevsky book.</p>
<p>He is definitely that.</p>
<p>He is definitely that, yes.</p>
<p>And apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky</p>
<p>than people had thought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some recent scholarship on that grounds.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky didn&rsquo;t know anything about Nietzsche</p>
<p>as far as I know.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche</p>
<p>is Nietzsche had to make things propositional</p>
<p>in some real sense, cause he was a philosopher.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to propositionalize things</p>
<p>that are outside your ken, but you can characterize them.</p>
<p>And so in the Brothers Karamazov,</p>
<p>Ivan is a more developed character than Eleosha.</p>
<p>In the explicit sense, he can make better arguments.</p>
<p>But Eleosha wins, like Mishkin, because he&rsquo;s the better man.</p>
<p>And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t render it entirely propositional,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably because what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be rendered entirely propositional.</p>
<p>And so Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.</p>
<p>He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,</p>
<p>atheist, materialist, and puts forward an argument</p>
<p>on that front that&rsquo;s still unparalleled</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>And overwhelms Eleosha, who cannot respond</p>
<p>but Eleosha&rsquo;s still the better man.</p>
<p>So, which is very interesting, you know, that.</p>
<p>You know, the funny thing about those two characters</p>
<p>is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody</p>
<p>that at least in part embodies both.</p>
<p>Because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,</p>
<p>rigorous in thought, but also are able</p>
<p>to have that kind of, what would you describe?</p>
<p>If you remove the religiosity of Eleosha,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, what&rsquo;s a good word?</p>
<p>Love towards the world.</p>
<p>Spirit of encouragement.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s, you know, one of the things</p>
<p>I did learn, perhaps, from looking into the abyss</p>
<p>to the degree that I have had to, or was willing to,</p>
<p>was that at some level you have to make</p>
<p>a fundamental statement of faith.</p>
<p>When God creates the world, after each day,</p>
<p>He says, He saw that it was good.</p>
<p>You think, well, is it good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, do you want to bring a child</p>
<p>into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question</p>
<p>of whether or not it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an act of faith to declare that it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because the evidence is ambivalent.</p>
<p>And so then you think, okay, well,</p>
<p>am I gonna act as if it&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>And what would happen if I did?</p>
<p>And maybe the answer to that is, I think this is the answer.</p>
<p>The more you act out the proposition that it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>the better it gets.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky said, this is something else.</p>
<p>Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,</p>
<p>but for everything everyone else does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what is that profound, or are you just insane?</p>
<p>Then you think, is what you receive back proportionate</p>
<p>to what you deliver?</p>
<p>And the answer to that might be yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrifying idea, man.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly, you can see that it&rsquo;s true in some sense</p>
<p>because people certainly respond to you in kind</p>
<p>with how you treat them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly the case.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s terrifying and it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an adventure, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You, yeah, you create the world by the way you live it.</p>
<p>The world you experience is defined by the way</p>
<p>you live that world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And then taken as a collective,</p>
<p>we create the world together in that way.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve defined it many, many times</p>
<p>throughout this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the adventure along the route, man.</p>
<p>And I would say, where&rsquo;s that adventure to be found?</p>
<p>In faith?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the faith?</p>
<p>The highest value is love and truth is its handmaiden.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a statement of faith, right?</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>You have to act it out to see if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s true. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t even find out without,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s so peculiar.</p>
<p>You have to make the commitment a priori.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s like a marriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, is this the person for me?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p>
<p>How do I find out if this is the person for me?</p>
<p>By binding myself to them.</p>
<p>Well, maybe the same thing is true of life, right?</p>
<p>You bind yourself to it.</p>
<p>And the tighter you bind yourself to it,</p>
<p>the more you find out what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a radical embrace.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really radical embrace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crucifix symbol.</p>
<p>And more than that, because like I said,</p>
<p>the full passion story isn&rsquo;t death.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t even unjust death.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t even unjust death</p>
<p>and the crucifixion of the innocent,</p>
<p>which is really getting pretty bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unjust, torturous, innocent death,</p>
<p>attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a hell of a thing to radically embrace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, bring it on.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal</p>
<p>and think they can get to that ideal</p>
<p>while living in a place of cynicism</p>
<p>and ultimately escape from life</p>
<p>and hiding from life, afraid of life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautifully put that love</p>
<p>is the highest ideal to reach for and truth is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s handmade.</p>
<p>I thought about that for a long time, right?</p>
<p>This hierarchy of ideal.</p>
<p>And the thing about truth, that bitter truth,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, that cynical truth,</p>
<p>is it can break the shackles of naivety.</p>
<p>And actually a burnt cynicism</p>
<p>is a moral improvement over a blind naivety.</p>
<p>Even though one is in some ways positive,</p>
<p>but only because it&rsquo;s protected.</p>
<p>And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not done at that point.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just barely started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re cynical?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not cynical enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how cynical are you?</p>
<p>Are you, I&rsquo;m an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?</p>
<p>Because you have to be,</p>
<p>you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds</p>
<p>before you find that part of you.</p>
<p>But you can find it if you want.</p>
<p>And then you think, well, I want to stop this.</p>
<p>Well, that was the question you posed.</p>
<p>In some sense, you&rsquo;re obsessed with,</p>
<p>say, what happened on these mass scale catastrophes</p>
<p>in the communist countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, millions of people participated.</p>
<p>So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.</p>
<p>So what part of that is you?</p>
<p>And you can find it if you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>The prisoner, the interrogator, the Judas.</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>All of it, yeah.</p>
<p>And all of it is inside us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you just have to look.</p>
<p>And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.</p>
<p>Jordan, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply honored you would talk to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world.</p>
<p>And thank you for the love.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks for the invitation, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
<p>You must have chaos within you</p>
<p>to give birth to a dancing star.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you</p>
<p>next time.</p>
