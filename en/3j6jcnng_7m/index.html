Transcript ﻿so there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that you absolutely need to avoid if you get an ear infection i&amp;rsquo;m primarily talking about your children if they develop an ear infection they must avoid this one thing but let&amp;rsquo;s first talk about what this infection is another name for it is otitis media the word media comes from the word middle because you have an external part of your ear then you have a middle ear then you have the inner ear okay these infections originate from the middle part of the ear which i have in my nice diagram right here there&amp;rsquo;s a small tube which is about an inch and a half that connects the inner ear to the back of your throat and normally it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed but it&amp;rsquo;s there for several reasons number one to prevent mucus from your back of your throat back up into the ear and because it has a little uh valve there and it&amp;rsquo;s also there to help equalize pressure so let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you&amp;rsquo;re in a plane and there&amp;rsquo;s pressure building up you can swallow and it helps to equalize the pressure you can also yawn and do the same thing and it also has another function of helping you drain mucous if there&amp;rsquo;s mucus in the inner ear it can help drain into the back of the throat so it can actually work both ways now there&amp;rsquo;s several things that can increase the risk of getting an ear infection number one is smoking or being around secondhand smoke infection now as far as an infection goes 92 percent of the cases are bacteria and 70 of the cases are viral related so you can see that there&amp;rsquo;s a combination of both viruses and bacteria and one of the problems that i see is as soon as a child gets an ear infection a lot of times the parents run to get an antibiotic and sometimes doctors continue to give these antibiotics over and over and over and then this child develops antibiotic resistance and that becomes a huge problem and so a lot of doctors now are not recommending antibiotics right from the get-go they just give it three days and sometimes it gets resolved but there is a significant risk from the allergy the most common allergy which is cow&amp;rsquo;s milk allergy and so if your child is prone to your infections or they have an ear infection get them off milk and milk products immediately it&amp;rsquo;s probably the number one trigger in developing ear infections because if you have an allergy to milk you&amp;rsquo;re going to generate a lot of mucus that can back right up into this little station tube which is the connection between the back the throat and the inner ear so there&amp;rsquo;s also a couple other things you can do and by the way there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely zero research on this but it works i&amp;rsquo;ve seen it work over and over and over again just use a drop of colloidal silver you can drop it right into the ear it creates no side effects and it&amp;rsquo;s very anti-bacterial and anti-viral and you can do this several times a day and also a drop of garlic oil works very well and you can mix it in some olive oil and dilute it in this take one drop put into the ear let it soak down in there it&amp;rsquo;s very antiviral antibacterial and then number three and this is very important avoid milk and milk products and i would also avoid all sugars and one last point xylitol which is an alternative type of sugar it&amp;rsquo;s a sugar alcohol which has the ability to decrease risk of getting ear infections so as a sugar substitute for children xylitol would be a good thing women that breastfeed their children dramatically decrease the risk of getting ear infections all right there you go and thanks for watching before you go if you have a question

avoid if you get an ear infection i&rsquo;m primarily  </p><p>talking about your children if they develop an ear 
infection they must avoid this one thing but let&rsquo;s  </p><p>first talk about what this infection is another 
name for it is otitis media the word media comes  </p><p>from the word middle because you have an external 
part of your ear then you have a middle ear then  </p><p>you have the inner ear okay these infections 
originate from the middle part of the ear  </p><p>which i have in my nice diagram right here there&rsquo;s 
a small tube which is about an inch and a half  </p><p>that connects the inner ear to the back of your 
throat and normally it&rsquo;s collapsed but it&rsquo;s there  </p><p>for several reasons number one to prevent mucus 
from your back of your throat back up into the ear  </p><p>and because it has a little uh valve 
there and it&rsquo;s also there to help equalize  </p><p>pressure so let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re 
in a plane and there&rsquo;s pressure building up  </p><p>you can swallow and it helps to equalize the 
pressure you can also yawn and do the same thing  </p><p>and it also has another function of helping you 
drain mucous if there&rsquo;s mucus in the inner ear  </p><p>it can help drain into the back of the 
throat so it can actually work both ways  </p><p>now there&rsquo;s several things that can increase the 
risk of getting an ear infection number one is  </p><p>smoking or being around secondhand smoke infection 
now as far as an infection goes 92 percent of the  </p><p>cases are bacteria and 70 of the cases are viral 
related so you can see that there&rsquo;s a combination  </p><p>of both viruses and bacteria and one of the 
problems that i see is as soon as a child gets  </p><p>an ear infection a lot of times the parents run to 
get an antibiotic and sometimes doctors continue  </p><p>to give these antibiotics over and over and over 
and then this child develops antibiotic resistance  </p><p>and that becomes a huge problem and so a lot of 
doctors now are not recommending antibiotics right  </p><p>from the get-go they just give it three days 
and sometimes it gets resolved but there is a  </p><p>significant risk from the allergy the most 
common allergy which is cow&rsquo;s milk allergy  </p><p>and so if your child is prone to your infections 
or they have an ear infection get them off milk  </p><p>and milk products immediately it&rsquo;s probably the 
number one trigger in developing ear infections  </p><p>because if you have an allergy to milk you&rsquo;re 
going to generate a lot of mucus that can back  </p><p>right up into this little station tube which 
is the connection between the back the throat  </p><p>and the inner ear so there&rsquo;s also a couple 
other things you can do and by the way there&rsquo;s  </p><p>absolutely zero research on this but it works 
i&rsquo;ve seen it work over and over and over again  </p><p>just use a drop of colloidal silver you can drop 
it right into the ear it creates no side effects  </p><p>and it&rsquo;s very anti-bacterial and anti-viral 
and you can do this several times a day and  </p><p>also a drop of garlic oil works very well and 
you can mix it in some olive oil and dilute it  </p><p>in this take one drop put into the ear let it soak 
down in there it&rsquo;s very antiviral antibacterial  </p><p>and then number three and this is very important 
avoid milk and milk products and i would also  </p><p>avoid all sugars and one last point xylitol which 
is an alternative type of sugar it&rsquo;s a sugar  </p><p>alcohol which has the ability to decrease risk of 
getting ear infections so as a sugar substitute  </p><p>for children xylitol would be a good thing women 
that breastfeed their children dramatically  </p><p>decrease the risk of getting ear infections 
all right there you go and thanks for watching  </p><p>before you go if you have a question about a 
product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing 
by to help you this is just for the  </p><p>people in the u.s hopefully in the future 
we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
