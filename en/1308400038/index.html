    <p>Hi friends! So this week I want to talk some shit about social media. I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>share some realizations and then I&rsquo;m gonna rant for a minute because I have</p>
<p>some shit going on that&rsquo;s just pissing me off that I keep seeing on social media.</p>
<p>And one of the realizations I&rsquo;m gonna share about posting online and like</p>
<p>being online is one of the things that actually helped me move away and change</p>
<p>my life. First off, let&rsquo;s just jump into the shit. Social media gives people a</p>
<p>false sense of importance. And I&rsquo;m not talking about people with followers, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about people without followers too. Like I have some followers it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh cute, fun. But it gives day-to-day normal people a false sense of</p>
<p>importance also because you&rsquo;re posting shit and you feel like people are</p>
<p>keeping up with you. It&rsquo;s like you feel like people are watching you. You feel</p>
<p>like people actually give a fuck about you. So you&rsquo;re like posting your outfit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re posting your dinner, you&rsquo;re posting your this, posting your that. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like people feel the impulse to post everything they&rsquo;re doing because they</p>
<p>think people care. Like that&rsquo;s kind of like the vibe it gives you. Like it makes</p>
<p>you feel like someone&rsquo;s watching you. Like people give a fuck about you and</p>
<p>they want to know what you&rsquo;re up to. And this makes you feel better about your</p>
<p>life. It makes you feel good about your life. Even if it&rsquo;s a life that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re getting positively reinforced that like people care about</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing. So it makes you weirdly like in your mind feel better</p>
<p>about the life that you&rsquo;re living. And it makes you want to keep posting. Like yes,</p>
<p>some people do look at your page because they want to keep up with you. But a lot</p>
<p>of people don&rsquo;t. Like the reality is most people get on social media for a</p>
<p>distraction. They just want to like get online and just go play. So like anytime</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a void in someone&rsquo;s day, like you&rsquo;re waiting at the post office, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking driving and the lights red, you just get on your phone real quick and</p>
<p>you just like start scrolling to distract yourself. Or like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>cardio. Or you get in bed and you&rsquo;re just like bored and you&rsquo;re laying there so</p>
<p>you just start scrolling social media. People just scroll social media. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting on to look at you. You&rsquo;re just what pops up when they get online.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve had to humble the fuck out of myself. Like people don&rsquo;t actually give a</p>
<p>fuck what I&rsquo;m doing. Some people do and I get that. But majority of people, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>what comes up like when they&rsquo;re on social media. Like they&rsquo;re looking for a</p>
<p>distraction and I just happen to be there. You know like people are not like</p>
<p>watching my shit and eating it up the way that I think they are. Because like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>noticed I&rsquo;ve been so like stressed about what I post because I feel like</p>
<p>people give a fuck. They don&rsquo;t. They fucking don&rsquo;t. No one is watching my shit</p>
<p>and analyzing it as hard as I am. Like I&rsquo;m analyzing it and I see every piece</p>
<p>of content that I post and I&rsquo;m very like perfectionist about it. But I realize</p>
<p>like not everybody sees everything you post and not everybody gives a fuck. Like</p>
<p>genuinely. But the way that this realization helped me change my life and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the reason that I fully moved away is feeling good about yourself on social</p>
<p>media because you posted shit and you shared your dinner. Like let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>you shared a story of your dinner and 300 people watched it or a thousand</p>
<p>people watched it. Whatever it is. It&rsquo;s like people are watching me. Like it</p>
<p>gives you this sense of like oh my god like people care what I&rsquo;m up to. They</p>
<p>care what I&rsquo;m doing. And like you get in this false reality of like thinking</p>
<p>people give a fuck. And I&rsquo;m not trying to be a negative Nancy and like a Debbie</p>
<p>Downer and be like nobody gives a fuck about you. But social media heightens it</p>
<p>when it shouldn&rsquo;t. Like a lot of people are not actually doing shit with their</p>
<p>life. Like they&rsquo;re posting their fucking lemon water in the morning and they</p>
<p>think they have a sense of accomplishment because people are</p>
<p>watching their story. Babe they were swiping because they wanted distraction</p>
<p>and your little lemon water just popped up. Like I&rsquo;m so sorry to say it but</p>
<p>literally like social media will get you in the mindset that you&rsquo;re important and</p>
<p>that people care about you. And it&rsquo;s a weird thing because that distracts you</p>
<p>from the reality of your actual life. And this will give you a false sense of</p>
<p>connection. I think that&rsquo;s the better way to say it. It&rsquo;s not that you aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>important but you&rsquo;re going to feel a lot more connected to people than you</p>
<p>actually are. And you&rsquo;re going to feel like a lot more people are concerned</p>
<p>about you. And this will become addicting and you will get addicted as fuck to</p>
<p>posting online because that&rsquo;s your sense of connection. That&rsquo;s your sense of</p>
<p>feeling good. So that&rsquo;s how I actually got to the point where I was ready to</p>
<p>move. Like I was looking at my social media presence online. I&rsquo;m like okay I</p>
<p>have followers. Cute. Fun. But what is my actual life? Like when I stopped letting</p>
<p>social media distract me from what my life actually was and how I actually</p>
<p>felt about my life. I was sat square in the reality of it and it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>fucking comfortable reality. Like it was like oh shit this is my life. Like take</p>
<p>away the distraction of social media. Take away feeling like people give a</p>
<p>fuck about you. Take away all that. Like turn your phone off and then look at</p>
<p>your life. What the fuck? Literally that&rsquo;s what came out of my mouth when I</p>
<p>did that. I was like what the literal fuck is my life? Like if I turn my phone</p>
<p>off all my followers disappear. All my content disappears. Like if I just look</p>
<p>at the square reality of what my life is. I was like damn like I&rsquo;m not actually</p>
<p>doing as good as I thought I was. And that&rsquo;s the fucking problem. Social media</p>
<p>makes everybody think that they&rsquo;re doing a lot better than they actually are.</p>
<p>Because it makes you feel like people are watching you and keeping up with you</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re fucking not. It&rsquo;s just the appearance of that. But these social</p>
<p>media platforms have been engineered and set up in a way to make you addicted to</p>
<p>them as a consumer. Like as you&rsquo;re watching other people and you also get</p>
<p>addicted to posting. Like your whole sense of self is like tied up in it</p>
<p>sometimes. And your sense of feeling good and feeling like important is tied up in</p>
<p>that. That&rsquo;s a basic need of a human being is to feel important. And these</p>
<p>apps have literally like capitalized on that to make us addicted to them. Because</p>
<p>like everyone posts their story and no one posts with intention anymore. No one</p>
<p>actually like takes time to post like meaningful shit or like anything that</p>
<p>matters to them. It&rsquo;s like oh they&rsquo;re just posting their daily routine and</p>
<p>their fucking coffee they had and their random shit. It&rsquo;s like girl who literally</p>
<p>gives a fuck? Like you know what I mean? Like it&rsquo;s cute and it&rsquo;s nice to watch. I</p>
<p>like when people post certain things. I&rsquo;m not for the fucking lemon water and the</p>
<p>coffee. We get it bitch. But everybody posts it. Like everybody is posting</p>
<p>everything they do in a day. But I was doing the same thing until I broke out</p>
<p>of that. Like I was posting all my random little day-to-day shit thinking that</p>
<p>somebody gave a fuck. And then once I realized like yo what is your life</p>
<p>actually? Stop with the image you&rsquo;re putting online. Stop with sharing shit</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Like take it take it away for a second and look at your</p>
<p>actual life and how you actually feel. And stop trying to feel better about it.</p>
<p>Like get square in the reality what the fuck your life is dude. That was just a</p>
<p>big thing for me because once I looked at my life it became so uncomfortable</p>
<p>and I was like ew like I&rsquo;m changing it. And literally within a week I moved away</p>
<p>and changed my whole fucking life. Like that realization set me the fuck free.</p>
<p>But now I just look around on social media and I&rsquo;m like what the fuck is</p>
<p>everybody doing? Like people put so much effort into their posts and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>girl what the fuck? Like I understand it&rsquo;s most people&rsquo;s jobs but I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>like normal people. Like people with like a thousand followers that are just</p>
<p>like normal and not trying to have a big presence online. Like what the fuck are</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all stressing out so hard for? So Betty Bop in the fucking town you grew up in</p>
<p>can look at what you&rsquo;re doing and it makes people feel a sense of importance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not real. Like this I&rsquo;m just trying to like break that down for</p>
<p>everybody because it fucked me up for so long. Like I was just living in this</p>
<p>reality of like social media is fun like oh it made me feel better about who I am</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m actually doing. And as soon as I realized social media helped me</p>
<p>feel better about the life I was living I was like oh fuck. Like that&rsquo;s where the</p>
<p>awareness kicked in and I was like why is it making me feel better? Why is</p>
<p>social media making me feel better about my life? Like that should not be</p>
<p>happening. Like escaping your reality and playing on a little platform should not</p>
<p>make you feel better okay? You should feel good in your normal day-to-day life</p>
<p>as it is. So that let me know that there was like a big disconnect of like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not truly happy in my life. And realizing that made me understand I need to have a</p>
<p>life that I truly enjoy living and then share parts of it. It&rsquo;s like the trend</p>
<p>now on social media to not live an exciting life. It&rsquo;s just to make it look</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re living an exciting life. Like you&rsquo;re supposed to have a life</p>
<p>everybody wants and be sharing parts of that. Not just orchestrating it to look</p>
<p>like you have a good life online. Am I making sense or am I just talking</p>
<p>fucking shit? Because I feel like nobody is like worth the shit anymore. Like</p>
<p>everybody just lives for social media. They don&rsquo;t live and then share it on</p>
<p>social media. And that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons so many influencers are burning</p>
<p>the fuck out. Like so many people are quitting. So many people are like oh my</p>
<p>god I had to take a mental health break. It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re orchestrating their</p>
<p>life to look pretty. They don&rsquo;t actually have a pretty life. Like there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>exhaustion when there&rsquo;s a disconnect between who you actually are and the</p>
<p>image you&rsquo;re portraying. That&rsquo;s exhausting to keep up. But if you</p>
<p>actually had a life you liked, you&rsquo;d just be sharing parts of it casually. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where the fuck my voice is going but it&rsquo;s trying to run away. And one more</p>
<p>part with that I&rsquo;m gonna get into in a few minutes is trying to just casually</p>
<p>share your life is no longer cool anymore. Like if it&rsquo;s not like high</p>
<p>production, high quality, people are like stressing the fuck out. So it&rsquo;s like even</p>
<p>if you just want to share a casual part of your life, so much effort goes into</p>
<p>trying to make it look better and make it look pretty and make it look like</p>
<p>well-produced. Like that&rsquo;s fucking exhausting and it&rsquo;s annoying. Like even</p>
<p>if you do have a happy and exciting life, it&rsquo;s not gonna look that exciting because</p>
<p>everybody else&rsquo;s image they&rsquo;re putting on is so fucking fake and it&rsquo;s so over</p>
<p>the top that where you actually have a life that you&rsquo;re happy, it doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re that happy because these other people are like blowing smoke up</p>
<p>your fucking ass with what they&rsquo;re posting. It&rsquo;s just the comparison thing</p>
<p>of like I could be sharing my actual life and how I&rsquo;m doing good but if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not doing ten times more than what I&rsquo;m currently doing like Joe Schmoe here on</p>
<p>the side with his fucking Lamborghini, like my life doesn&rsquo;t look that great. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually fallen into this trap before too. Like you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>content, you&rsquo;re trying to make shit so important but what you need to be trying</p>
<p>to do is make your life worthy of content. Like so it&rsquo;s easy to just pull</p>
<p>out a fucking camera, record a tidbit of what you&rsquo;re actually doing, and then</p>
<p>share it. But it&rsquo;s so backwards now, like it&rsquo;s so inauthentic. It&rsquo;s so like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking of ideas to make it look like my life is pretty. How do I keep thinking</p>
<p>of more ideas? But people don&rsquo;t realize motherfucker, make your life better and</p>
<p>it will be easier to film it. And I haven&rsquo;t figured this out fully, like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still working on it too. But that&rsquo;s just one of the things I&rsquo;ve realized recently</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m working on implementing that because I&rsquo;m living a life that like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so busy and doing so much shit but I actually enjoy it. And now I&rsquo;m at the</p>
<p>point where I&rsquo;m not recording so much because I&rsquo;m actually like enjoying my</p>
<p>life and getting shit done. Like it&rsquo;s the weirdest thing, it&rsquo;s like I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying make a good life so you can share that, but I&rsquo;d be having fun now. Like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever pull out my fucking phone, I&rsquo;m not that type. Like I always forget to</p>
<p>pull out my phone. I&rsquo;d be forgetting I&rsquo;m an influencer. Like I don&rsquo;t even like to</p>
<p>fucking say that. But like I do have an obligation kind of now to post online</p>
<p>and I let it stress me out for so long and I&rsquo;m just like no, like if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>doing shit I&rsquo;m not posting. Or like if I&rsquo;m just busy working like I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>posting, I&rsquo;m fucking getting my business done. I hope these thoughts are making</p>
<p>sense because it makes sense in my fucking brain. And it&rsquo;s been the weirdest</p>
<p>thing to watch once I became aware of all this and stopped really like doing</p>
<p>it. Like I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing with my social media, like I want</p>
<p>to change it. I want to fucking delete it all but I can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything I do now, like everything I do now is dependent on it. Like I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just fucking shut my shit off. So I&rsquo;m kind of stuck with it but I really want</p>
<p>to change what I post and how I post. But I&rsquo;m like what the fuck am I doing even?</p>
<p>You know like I want to post with more intention and get out of the mindset of</p>
<p>like people give a fuck what I&rsquo;m doing. Like they don&rsquo;t. They genuinely don&rsquo;t. So</p>
<p>my social media got very draining. Like posting on social media got draining as</p>
<p>fuck. But now I&rsquo;m just kind of like being a lot more casual. I&rsquo;m stopped trying to</p>
<p>be so like perfect and I&rsquo;m just like fucking around now. Like I&rsquo;m at the point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally just like fucking around. Like I just do what I want to post and I</p>
<p>make sure I have fun with it. Because if you don&rsquo;t have fun with it, it&rsquo;ll turn</p>
<p>into a task. So now I just post what I want. Like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like whatever I&rsquo;m over it. Like I&rsquo;ll post little things. I post my little</p>
<p>get ready with me on TikTok and like it did good and I&rsquo;m just like this is funny</p>
<p>as shit. Like I literally don&rsquo;t care about social media anymore. Like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying. And now I&rsquo;m gonna start ranting. Okay I got the deep shit out of the way</p>
<p>but now I just want to run my mouth. Like literally everybody now is somebody on</p>
<p>social media. Like everybody is a somebody and I fucking hate it. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much to unpack with this but typically like people didn&rsquo;t have like</p>
<p>super good quality content unless they were big or unless they were somebody.</p>
<p>And what I mean by somebody is like you have a lot of followers. Like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>somebody big. Like you were given the opportunity to have like super well</p>
<p>produced content because you made it. And now everybody has a nice camera and</p>
<p>everybody has like super good quality shit. Like girl what the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t tell who is a somebody and who&rsquo;s actually important and who&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because like Joe Schmoes that go to my gym have like 2,000 followers and they</p>
<p>have like next level like drop 5k on a fucking camera and they have the top of</p>
<p>the top quality for their pictures. And I&rsquo;m like who is this? It&rsquo;s too accessible</p>
<p>now. It&rsquo;s like everybody looks like a somebody because having like really</p>
<p>really well orchestrated content and like pictures and like high quality shit</p>
<p>is so accessible to everyone now. You can&rsquo;t tell who actually is a somebody</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the biggest mindfuck. Because I&rsquo;m like oh they must be big. No girl</p>
<p>they got like 2k. I&rsquo;m like what the fuck are you doing? I have so many followers</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t even give a shit. Like I literally just like I want to</p>
<p>have the good quality content but like I don&rsquo;t care. So I&rsquo;m like how do y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>care? Can y&rsquo;all tell me the trick? Because I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. But the other thing</p>
<p>with that like everything is so mass-produced and I&rsquo;m fucking sick of it.</p>
<p>Like everything is mass-produced. Like what the fuck? No one is just like making</p>
<p>random ass videos anymore and like everyone is so effort. Like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>putting so much effort into what they&rsquo;re posting. I&rsquo;m like girl let&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>make it easy. I don&rsquo;t like to post things that are like difficult to create. Like I</p>
<p>just want easy little things to like throw together and post. I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>put the effort into it. But like that&rsquo;s how social media used to be. No one put</p>
<p>effort and it was just random little tidbits of your life. Now everybody is so</p>
<p>fucking orchestrated and perfecting the image that they have on social media. So</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like uncommon to have normal quality content. Like if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>mass-produced shit you&rsquo;re looked at like a fucking idiot and like you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing. Like it&rsquo;s weird. Like it&rsquo;s so weird. It&rsquo;s intimidating and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sick of it. Like I don&rsquo;t like to have to put effort into pictures and shit and</p>
<p>videos. Like literally girl turn your fucking phone off and everything that</p>
<p>you just worked on all day is gone. Like we work so hard and put so much effort</p>
<p>into posting shit online when online doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s not a tangible thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little glass box as our phone. We waste all this time of our</p>
<p>actual life, living our actual being and like being a human. We spend the time</p>
<p>that we have to experience life making fucking content that doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>really. Like you literally shut your phone off, you turn off Wi-Fi and</p>
<p>everything you did was for nothing. Like there&rsquo;s no&hellip; Does that make sense? Like I</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird wrapping my mind around like I don&rsquo;t want to put effort into making</p>
<p>my life look good anymore and like making it look pretty online. I want to</p>
<p>put my effort into having a good life and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing. And but</p>
<p>my social media is like slacking because of it. Cuz like even if I post my</p>
<p>life as it is now it&rsquo;s fucking great. It&rsquo;s way better than it&rsquo;s ever been but</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t appear that great because there&rsquo;s so many other people posting</p>
<p>online that their lives are a hundred times better than they actually are. So</p>
<p>like me living a normal good life is not shit compared to what&rsquo;s out there. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t even care to fucking put the effort into it. Like girl I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna just do my goddamn thing. Like I said I&rsquo;m just ranting at this point but</p>
<p>social media has really been pissing me off. Like it&rsquo;s so weird now and the</p>
<p>biggest thing is like everybody&rsquo;s a somebody and I can&rsquo;t get off that. Like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why it aggravates the shit out of me. People really are a fucking</p>
<p>nobody but they have their really good camera quality and they&rsquo;re really like</p>
<p>mass-produced content but like what they&rsquo;re sharing is actually shit. But one</p>
<p>thing I do think is really fucking funny is when people get pissy when they</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t gaining followers. Like everybody thinks the trick is to have perfect</p>
<p>quality content and you&rsquo;ll grow. But people are spending all this money on</p>
<p>like editors and all these expensive ass cameras. Their quality is fucking</p>
<p>immaculate. It&rsquo;s 10 out of 10 but they still aren&rsquo;t growing. Everyone&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to figure out the cheat code and they think that&rsquo;s it. Like sure high quality</p>
<p>content will help you grow a little bit but now it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have</p>
<p>quality content because everybody fucking does. Like it&rsquo;s not the flex</p>
<p>anymore. Like everybody&rsquo;s like oh I&rsquo;ll just go be hot and it&rsquo;s enough. Everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bored of that. Everyone&rsquo;s fucking bored of the perfect content and everybody</p>
<p>being so goddamn fake. Like now in order for you to grow on social media you have</p>
<p>to actually be special and be someone worth the fuck. You can&rsquo;t just look like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re someone worth the fuck because everyone sees through it. Does that make</p>
<p>sense? Like everybody looks like they are somebody so everyone&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>unimpressed by that. Like you actually have to be someone and share good</p>
<p>quality stuff or like actually be funny. Actually have a personality. Actually</p>
<p>share valuable information to get followers and people don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t fucking like it and it&rsquo;s so funny to watch everybody get pissy. I</p>
<p>have one more point I&rsquo;m gonna make and then I&rsquo;m gonna talk shit about the gym I</p>
<p>go to Alphaland and all the influencers I&rsquo;ve been seeing in real life. Y&rsquo;all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to burst a little bubbles I&rsquo;m sorry. But the thing about social media</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really been pissing me off is ads are everywhere. Like literally Instagram</p>
<p>the new algorithm is so beyond fucked. I don&rsquo;t see anyone I actually fucking</p>
<p>follow. I&rsquo;m sick of it. It&rsquo;s ugly. Only thing getting posted is reels. Girl I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t always want to watch a fucking video. I want to look at pictures too.</p>
<p>Like I understand TikTok was doing good and it&rsquo;s all videos like Instagram</p>
<p>trying to copy it. What the fuck ever. But ads literally every other fucking video</p>
<p>is a goddamn ad and it pisses me off. Like I&rsquo;m actually like so aggravated by</p>
<p>it. Like I understand these apps need to make their money. Like Instagram it says</p>
<p>that you need to make your money. I get it. But can you space your fucking ads</p>
<p>out a little bitch or can you give me a fucking thing where I can pay $10 a</p>
<p>month I don&rsquo;t have to see a goddamn fucking ad because I&rsquo;m sick of them. Like</p>
<p>YouTube Red or premium whatever it is it&rsquo;s like 10 bucks a month. I have that</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t have to watch anybody&rsquo;s stupid fucking ads. Like I hate</p>
<p>advertisements. I fucking hate them and that&rsquo;s all social media is now. Like even</p>
<p>on Instagram stories like you click two fucking stories and then boom there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>ad. Here&rsquo;s a couch you could buy. Here&rsquo;s a fucking sweater. Like I&rsquo;m sick of it.</p>
<p>Like everything is ads and even if it&rsquo;s not ads like everyone that is creating</p>
<p>content now is creating shit and using their social media to sell something.</p>
<p>Like everything is marketed and I&rsquo;m like what the fuck dude. Like social media is</p>
<p>no longer fun. Like social media is annoying as shit. It&rsquo;s so fucking fake</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s not fake as fuck there&rsquo;s ads everywhere and if it&rsquo;s not an actual ad</p>
<p>like they paid for the ad it&rsquo;s someone marketing something. Like it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>the most annoying shit. Like no one just posts on social media to post anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all calculated and it&rsquo;s all like ew I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. Like</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s posting to sell something or posting to feel better about their self</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re actually doing with their little shitty booty life and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like everything is so see-through and when I say awareness is a curse it</p>
<p>fucking is because I can&rsquo;t enjoy social media anymore. I&rsquo;m too aware of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on. Like I can&rsquo;t enjoy shit. Like reality TV I used to love. I used to eat</p>
<p>it up. I don&rsquo;t fucking care no more. Like I see through it. I understand so</p>
<p>many elements. I know how to break down everything. It&rsquo;s like my brain is not</p>
<p>stimulated anymore and it&rsquo;s scary because all of my life is like on social</p>
<p>media. Girl this really just turned into a fucking rant huh? I literally just get</p>
<p>on social media now to post my shit and get off. Like I watch my own things and I</p>
<p>watch a couple of my friends things but I don&rsquo;t sit and like consume social</p>
<p>media anymore. You can&rsquo;t. Like you literally will consume ads. That&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fucking consume. Girl I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going with this. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kind of going but I do want to talk shit on influencers at the fucking gym</p>
<p>that I go to. Yo you guys have no idea what people look like in real life. Like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much more that goes into these influencers than you realize. They</p>
<p>are all like two feet tall. I swear to God they&rsquo;re the smallest little fucking</p>
<p>rugrats I&rsquo;ve ever seen running around the gym. Like on social media they look</p>
<p>huge. They look massive and then you see them in real life and they&rsquo;re like the</p>
<p>size of a pack of fucking gum. Like I don&rsquo;t get it. I literally don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so weird to see someone with so many followers online and they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>respected for the person that they are online and then the person they are in</p>
<p>real life is a fucking wacko. Like they&rsquo;re lame. Like they&rsquo;re literally lame</p>
<p>as shit. They&rsquo;re insecure as fuck. You can tell by the way that they walk. Like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing. It&rsquo;s like you see all these influencers but you don&rsquo;t see the</p>
<p>way that they walk and the way that they carry their self. Like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>highly respected in the little world they&rsquo;ve created online but in real life</p>
<p>they know they&rsquo;re a fucking dipshit. They know that they&rsquo;re not shit. Like they</p>
<p>literally just walk around so insecure and like scared and timid and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what the hell. And then you have the other ones that are like overinflated</p>
<p>sense of fucking ego in public or at the gym or like at clubs and shit. Like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re overinflated their sense of self but really like I see you. You&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>fucking loser. Like you can just tell by the way that they behave y&rsquo;all. When I</p>
<p>said being aware is a curse it&rsquo;s also fun because I get to see through people.</p>
<p>Like I know who has followers and who doesn&rsquo;t by the way that they fucking act</p>
<p>sometimes. You can just spot it. Like I&rsquo;m very good at that. But there is this one</p>
<p>guy on TikTok that screams like motivational shit. Like he&rsquo;ll scream at</p>
<p>people get the fuck up and get to the gym and all this and that. And then I saw</p>
<p>him at the gym and I was like girl you be yelling like that? Like sure he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>decent shape but like seeing who he was in real life and the way that he walked</p>
<p>and the way he carried himself I was like you&rsquo;re a laughingstock. You online</p>
<p>are on there screaming at people? Like girl you? I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m so baffled by it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m so baffled. The main reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is because I want to</p>
<p>put everybody&rsquo;s mind at ease and to help everybody be less insecure because the</p>
<p>people you&rsquo;re judging your life against online like you see these people that</p>
<p>are all cool and they&rsquo;re all great they&rsquo;re all this they&rsquo;re all that and</p>
<p>then you look at your life and you just subconsciously compare it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>them. Like they aren&rsquo;t like that in real life and I want to set everybody free</p>
<p>from that mentally. Like the people that you idolize online are not this fucking</p>
<p>cool. Like they&rsquo;re not shit in real life and I hate to sound like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>dogging the fuck out of everybody but I&rsquo;m very protective of my followers</p>
<p>because I care about all of you and I know how hard it is to be comparing</p>
<p>yourself to people online and how much it will fuck with you and your sense of</p>
<p>value and your sense of self so I just want to protect you all from that and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m revealing this shit. Like these people are not as cool as you</p>
<p>think. They&rsquo;re not anything to be intimidated by. They&rsquo;re nothing special.</p>
<p>Like there are some people that are really cool that have really great</p>
<p>content that are like cool ass people in real life but most of them are not this</p>
<p>special and that&rsquo;s the thing is like when you get online everybody looks</p>
<p>special. You think everybody is special and there&rsquo;s no way that this many people</p>
<p>are special is all I&rsquo;m gonna tell you and reassure you of. So you can tell the</p>
<p>ones that are actually special. So many more are just an image online and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you all comparing yourself to the shit that you see because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>real. Like this is just what I&rsquo;m trying to expose in this episode is the reality</p>
<p>of it so that y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t feel so bad about yourself because I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>anything to hurt you guys. I&rsquo;m exposing it. Like I&rsquo;m ranting a little and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being a little rough I know but I&rsquo;m not talking shit. I&rsquo;m just trying to protect</p>
<p>you all and share some of the things that I wish somebody else would have</p>
<p>shared. Like someone else that was around influencers. I wish someone else would</p>
<p>have posted this a couple years ago before I got into all this because I</p>
<p>felt so bad about myself and like my life and what was online. Like I was so</p>
<p>intimidated by everything online. I was like my life is not shit but I just want</p>
<p>to reassure you guys the norm and like what looks normal online none of these</p>
<p>people are actually experiencing it okay like it&rsquo;s a very small scale of people</p>
<p>who are actually special who are actually balling like you think and who</p>
<p>are actually living a life that you think that you want. Most of this shit is</p>
<p>so fake so I just want to protect you all mentally and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to accomplish but y&rsquo;all know I just like to complain and talk shit but that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>motive and I just want to make that very clear and girl the fucking tea that</p>
<p>I have about that goddamn gym these influencers none of them like each other</p>
<p>they literally all- I&rsquo;m gonna get fucking shit on I might get into trouble for</p>
<p>this but none of these fucking influencers are friends none of them</p>
<p>fucking like each other okay they literally get together film content and</p>
<p>fuck off like they literally like some of them don&rsquo;t like each other at all but</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re not friends like it seems like none of these influencers are actually</p>
<p>like bestie boos and especially the fucking drama with the photographers if</p>
<p>you see an influencer with a photographer and then you see the</p>
<p>photographer all of a sudden stop working with them there&rsquo;s a motherfucking</p>
<p>problem there I&rsquo;m just gonna let you know I know so much tea and I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>one to ever like rat out people&rsquo;s business like I like to be someone that</p>
<p>people can talk to because I like to know everything going on I like to know</p>
<p>the tea so I&rsquo;ll never fully spill it like I&rsquo;ll never come on here like talking</p>
<p>and like exposing people&rsquo;s fucking shit but I will say photographers and</p>
<p>influencers if they all of a sudden have a breakup one of them switch the fuck up</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m just gonna let you know some people get too big for their fucking</p>
<p>britches whether it&rsquo;s the photographer or the influencer but there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>snake shit that goes on and there&rsquo;s so many weird-ass dynamics but like I said</p>
<p>these people are not friends like the people you see online like oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many of these collabs be so staged and so fucking fake like I posted</p>
<p>a video of my friend Leslie me and her are actually friends as fuck like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like one of my best friends here I see her at the gym every day I&rsquo;ve hung out</p>
<p>with her like a month before I ever posted anything online of us like we</p>
<p>were at her pool getting fucking drunk we finished a bottle of tequila together</p>
<p>we talked about all our deepest darkest secrets like she&rsquo;s a genuine ass bitch</p>
<p>and like before I ever got online with her like we were really good friends and</p>
<p>we developed a really good friendship these people you see online are literally</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t know a fuck thing about each other they meet up for the videos</p>
<p>so they can get clout from each other they make a video and dip and a lot of</p>
<p>them like don&rsquo;t like each other but they want to get the other person&rsquo;s followers</p>
<p>and be seen with them so they can grow like it&rsquo;s so fucking fake and it&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>bullshit it&rsquo;s honestly kind of funny like seeing it like I&rsquo;m I say it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m so shocked I&rsquo;m like what the hell like literally moving to Houston</p>
<p>was the my favorite thing I ever did cuz I&rsquo;m getting like all the tea like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>living in it like I&rsquo;m living in the fucking Mecca of like all this drama and</p>
<p>it is so funny and y&rsquo;all these people all be fucking each other no fuck that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny like I think it&rsquo;s so fucking funny they all be fucking each other for</p>
<p>clout like they fuck each other for clout they fuck each other for videos</p>
<p>and a lot of them just fuck each other like it&rsquo;s so messy like I just like to</p>
<p>sit back and observe like I just like to watch and know everything going on</p>
<p>and all of them on drugs all of them on fucking drugs I&rsquo;m telling you steroids</p>
<p>or molly coke ecstasy like party drugs they&rsquo;re on party drugs or they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>fucking steroids most of them are on both but all these people y&rsquo;all posting</p>
<p>about all this nutrition all this health and wellness all this this is how you</p>
<p>live your lifestyle here&rsquo;s my lemon water here&rsquo;s my fat burners they are the</p>
<p>most drug using motherfuckers I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life like it&rsquo;s insane but one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s so funny to me about molly and ecstasy like that&rsquo;s a girl drug oh</p>
<p>my god I&rsquo;m so sorry in my opinion like that&rsquo;s a fucking girl drug like to roll</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s such a bitch thing to do like that&rsquo;s for the girls in the gays</p>
<p>straight guys that roll well I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s so unattractive to me</p>
<p>but like that&rsquo;s so pussy fitness people especially they love some molly bitch</p>
<p>they love some fucking ecstasy I just want to say these influences party a lot</p>
<p>and they party hard bitch like you think that they&rsquo;re not gonna spend the money</p>
<p>that they have like they&rsquo;re buying fish scale they&rsquo;re not buying like normal</p>
<p>shit but like they are partying hard as fuck and like a lot of them posts like</p>
<p>oh I went to the club last night but I only had water girl no the fuck you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you have some ecstasy I don&rsquo;t know why this is so funny to me this is</p>
<p>just hilarious to me I have a time of this like I just love knowing everything</p>
<p>but the image y&rsquo;all are seeing online is not these people like it&rsquo;s not fucking</p>
<p>them at all like everybody posts what they think they need to post everyone is</p>
<p>trying to orchestrate a certain image for like hidden motives and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m sick of it I can everybody just go back to being like normal and just</p>
<p>like spamming their fucking feed and shit like stop trying to look perfect I</p>
<p>do want to say that anyone you see me posting in a picture with like on my</p>
<p>profiles they&rsquo;re a genuine ass person and I&rsquo;ve tested them y&rsquo;all know I test</p>
<p>everybody but the people that I post with are people that I&rsquo;ve been friends</p>
<p>with I don&rsquo;t just take a picture with someone and post them like if I say that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in my life they&rsquo;re actually in my life I don&rsquo;t do the whole clout shit</p>
<p>like I post on my Instagram is like my actual friends that&rsquo;s like the people I</p>
<p>actually have in my life so if you ever see me with someone they&rsquo;re a good one</p>
<p>if you see me not with someone I don&rsquo;t know them yet or I&rsquo;m avoiding them and</p>
<p>one more thing I want to talk about is everybody coming out with a goddamn</p>
<p>brand like everybody&rsquo;s coming out with their own brand and I&rsquo;m like cool I get</p>
<p>it like I respect the hustle but y&rsquo;all are all ordering from the same fucking</p>
<p>manufacturers on Alibaba and fucking getting all this same quality shit and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say it&rsquo;s shit because that&rsquo;s what it is like everybody&rsquo;s ordering the</p>
<p>same poor quality materials and products slapping their name on it and then</p>
<p>trying to sell it like how many more people can come out with brands like this</p>
<p>shit is so done it&rsquo;s so like washed out like everybody&rsquo;s fucking done it</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got a brand everybody&rsquo;s doing the same thing everybody&rsquo;s selling</p>
<p>the same products with different fucking labels and it&rsquo;s annoying like look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to buy no more there&rsquo;s no business to make anymore that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>product based business and there&rsquo;s no fucking like shit to buy no more it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the fucking same and like all the retailers and everybody like all the</p>
<p>quality of everything is going down this is a separate rant but the one about the</p>
<p>businesses girl these businesses are not making as much money as you think like</p>
<p>people with their little clothing brands the little sunglasses brands or the</p>
<p>little whatever fucking accessories they&rsquo;ve got like their little brands</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not making as much as you think I&rsquo;m gonna just leave it there cuz I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want something a negative Nelly cuz all I&rsquo;ve done is like talk shit this</p>
<p>whole time but my whole point I want to reiterate it is I&rsquo;m not bringing people</p>
<p>down I&rsquo;m bringing you guys into the awareness of the truth of it because it</p>
<p>will make you feel bad about your life like seeing all this shit going so right</p>
<p>for everybody on social media and all these people able to live these certain</p>
<p>ways I just want to promise you they&rsquo;re fucking not alright don&rsquo;t compare your</p>
<p>life to it don&rsquo;t get stressed out don&rsquo;t wonder why are you different you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>different everybody&rsquo;s dealing with the same shit people are just choosing what</p>
<p>they post and choosing what they don&rsquo;t post and I do post this a lot of a time</p>
<p>I always post you&rsquo;re doing better than you think you are and I want to remind</p>
<p>you of that and I just wanted to share a little bit of the truth of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually going on in the world and not just like the perfect part that people</p>
<p>show you like this life is not as pretty as people make it seem like the life of</p>
<p>being an influencer like I am one at this point like I&rsquo;m not that big but I</p>
<p>am at the point where like I&rsquo;m considered an influencer I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking like that term at all but I have to like accept the reality of it but I</p>
<p>just want you all to know the people that are sitting there looking up at</p>
<p>everybody that has more followers than them the life that you see is not as</p>
<p>fucking pretty as they think like my life is great but I&rsquo;m not focused on</p>
<p>like trying to make my life look perfect like I&rsquo;ll post on my story when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having a bad fucking day like I&rsquo;m crying I&rsquo;m upset like I just binge ate like I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>post like my shit and my struggles but a lot of people don&rsquo;t so just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compare yourself to the people online don&rsquo;t think that these people that have</p>
<p>followers have perfect lives they&rsquo;re literally a fucking train wreck like</p>
<p>most of them like social media is so much more of like a mental chess game</p>
<p>than you realize and it fucks people up so much cuz like I said these apps and</p>
<p>these platforms are created to make you addicted to them like people are</p>
<p>addicted to these apps as creators too like people are addicted to watching it</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re addicted to posting I&rsquo;ve fallen into that trap like it&rsquo;s so nice</p>
<p>when all these people are watching you and you have all these views and all</p>
<p>these likes it&rsquo;s like oh my god it&rsquo;s invigorating but it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>damaging because like I said it gives you a false sense of importance like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not important but it makes you feel like you are a lot</p>
<p>more important than you realize and then when your actual life doesn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a mind fuck cuz like online you are somebody you&rsquo;re big you&rsquo;re this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re that but in real life your life sucks and you fucking hate it there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot to unpack with that but yeah I just wanted to talk my shit a little bit but</p>
<p>with all that being said about how much I hate social media I do like it and if</p>
<p>you do want to follow me and check my shit out my Instagram and tick tocks and</p>
<p>everything will be linked in the description of this podcast if you like</p>
<p>this podcast leave it a 5 star rating whether you&rsquo;re on Spotify or Apple</p>
<p>podcast tell me you love 5 stars and if you want to hear me talk about any other</p>
<p>topics just send me a DM on Instagram I&rsquo;m always like adding to my list of</p>
<p>shit I want to talk about but that&rsquo;s all I got for this episode thank you so much</p>
