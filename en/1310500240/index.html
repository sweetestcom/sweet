    <p>The following is a conversation with Jimmy Pedro,</p>
<p>a legendary judo competitor and coach.</p>
<p>He represented the United States at four Olympics</p>
<p>in 92, 96, 2000, and 2004,</p>
<p>winning a bronze medal at two of them.</p>
<p>He medaled in three world championships,</p>
<p>winning gold in 1999.</p>
<p>He has coached many of the elite level American judoka,</p>
<p>including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,</p>
<p>Travis Stevens, and many others.</p>
<p>Plus, he&rsquo;s now my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?</p>
<p>I think Uchi Mata.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the one that seems</p>
<p>to have the most amplitude.</p>
<p>That person goes the highest,</p>
<p>you see a leg swing through the middle,</p>
<p>the person doing the throw, there&rsquo;s a leg swinging</p>
<p>through the middle, the other person definitely goes,</p>
<p>you know, head over heels, flat on their back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the most dynamic, pretty judo throw there is.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s a single, you&rsquo;re standing on a single foot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re raising your other foot in the air</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a forward throw, which means the,</p>
<p>your back is facing the opponent,</p>
<p>but they kind of both fly through the air</p>
<p>and twist through the air.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how does that throw work?</p>
<p>What are the principles behind that throw?</p>
<p>Is one of those throws that, you know,</p>
<p>people can kind of understand how to pick up</p>
<p>another human being in sort of trivial ways,</p>
<p>but the Uchi Mata to me never quite made sense,</p>
<p>like why it works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cork, there&rsquo;s a twisting motion,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some involvement of the hip,</p>
<p>but not, it&rsquo;s not really a hip throw</p>
<p>because the hip is not all the way over,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a very confusing throw to me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to say, can you say something through words?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably one of the most difficult throws</p>
<p>to learn as well, because it is so complex.</p>
<p>You do have to stand on one leg, balance on one leg,</p>
<p>you know, swing your other leg through the middle,</p>
<p>hold your opponent up in the air,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to, it&rsquo;s hard to make that contact</p>
<p>with upper body to your back.</p>
<p>You know, you have to turn your back on the throw as well.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely sort of a throw</p>
<p>where you need to start pulling your opponent&rsquo;s upper body</p>
<p>towards you, right?</p>
<p>So their upper body starts coming towards you.</p>
<p>Your legs go towards them</p>
<p>as your body starts to go into the throw.</p>
<p>So your head is gonna go left, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>your body, your legs are gonna go to the right,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s, your partner&rsquo;s gonna start to lean towards you.</p>
<p>And just as you start to get there,</p>
<p>momentum coming forward,</p>
<p>your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,</p>
<p>pick them up onto your hip, right,</p>
<p>and then the finish of the throw is a twist.</p>
<p>And a lot of times, the good judoka</p>
<p>will leave their feet when they do the throw,</p>
<p>so both bodies are in the air together,</p>
<p>and then the thrower comes down</p>
<p>on top of the person being thrown.</p>
<p>So all four feet are in the air.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just this unstoppable force that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re all in the air.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically doing a roll together.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay, so who, to you, is the best uchimata,</p>
<p>who has, besides yourself, the&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, there&rsquo;s plenty of guys</p>
<p>that do uchimata a lot better than I do.</p>
<p>You do have a nice video about the uchimata online,</p>
<p>but who is a great practitioner of the uchimata to you?</p>
<p>Right now, Shohei Ono, who&rsquo;s two time Olympic gold medalist,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his favorite throw,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s tons of highlight videos on the IGF</p>
<p>and judo fanatics showing how he does his uchimata,</p>
<p>and it is quite different than everybody else&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unstoppable.</p>
<p>When he comes in, nobody stops it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s won two golds in a row at the Olympics.</p>
<p>I think maybe in the last eight years,</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s lost two matches.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>At a very competitive division, I guess 73 kilos?</p>
<p>Okay, and then three time world champ too.</p>
<p>Is he the greatest of all time to you?</p>
<p>The only reason why he&rsquo;s not is because Nomura</p>
<p>is a 60 kilo player.</p>
<p>He was three time Olympic champion,</p>
<p>so Nomura, I mean, unless Ono&rsquo;s gonna stick around</p>
<p>for another three years and win again here in Paris,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;d match what Nomura did,</p>
<p>but three time gold medalist in judo</p>
<p>in a lightweight division, that&rsquo;s pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>So to you, being able to win a championship,</p>
<p>world championship, or Olympic medal</p>
<p>is a measure of greatness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you have some people</p>
<p>who are not as accomplished like Koga or something like that,</p>
<p>but just the beauty, the moments of magic,</p>
<p>the number of moments of magic is the highest,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not championships.</p>
<p>I think you have to go by that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many phenomenal judo players</p>
<p>that have come through the system of spectacular judo.</p>
<p>You have won countless major events,</p>
<p>but the ability to pull it together,</p>
<p>those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,</p>
<p>the world championships, the Olympic games,</p>
<p>and proving that you can do it time and time again</p>
<p>makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.</p>
<p>There was a guy back in the 70s and 80s by the name of Fuji</p>
<p>and he won four world championships back to back.</p>
<p>And back then, the Worlds was every two years.</p>
<p>So here he was, a four time world champion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s eight years the top of the sport.</p>
<p>He never won an Olympic medal.</p>
<p>He never went to the Olympics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy who missed out on Olympic greatness,</p>
<p>but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.</p>
<p>By the way, same Fuji as Fuji?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Really, okay.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know there was an actual guy, Fuji.</p>
<p>Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>But this is a different guy, his name was Fuji.</p>
<p>All right, well, history rhymes.</p>
<p>What about Teddy Renier?</p>
<p>10 time world champ, I think,</p>
<p>two time gold medalist at the Olympics,</p>
<p>two times bronze medalist at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Probably the most dominant judoka ever.</p>
<p>Is he in the running?</p>
<p>What do you think about that guy?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a freak of nature, Teddy.</p>
<p>If you look at the size, just how tall he is,</p>
<p>how big he is, how physical he is of a specimen.</p>
<p>I sat next to him on a bus,</p>
<p>and his legs are literally the size of my waist.</p>
<p>When you sit next to him and just look at the size,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big man.</p>
<p>So obviously to win 10 world titles in the sport of judo,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s almost an incomprehensible feat,</p>
<p>two time Olympic champion, again, that puts him in one</p>
<p>of the maybe 10 or 12 people to ever do that</p>
<p>in the history of the sport.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s definitely got to be in the running for the best.</p>
<p>But technically, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s as technical</p>
<p>as some of the other, in terms of pure judo finesse technique.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s powerful, he&rsquo;s explosive, he&rsquo;s dominant, he&rsquo;s strong.</p>
<p>Teddy also grips really, really well,</p>
<p>which makes him that much tougher to beat.</p>
<p>Because a lot of times heavyweights,</p>
<p>especially in the heavyweight division,</p>
<p>a lot of them just grab the gi and they go man to man</p>
<p>and judo to judo and take shots at each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of them end up getting beat.</p>
<p>But Teddy&rsquo;s in control, like positionally,</p>
<p>he stays in really good position</p>
<p>and he controls his opponent the whole fight.</p>
<p>So they really don&rsquo;t have a chance against them.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t give them a chance to beat him,</p>
<p>which is why he&rsquo;s been so dominant.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not really stalling.</p>
<p>So I mean, he does have a really nice Osorogari,</p>
<p>this backward trip, outside trip, in case people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And he has just like technically pretty good throws</p>
<p>for heavyweight.</p>
<p>Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty technical and clean</p>
<p>in the execution of his big throws.</p>
<p>But a lot of that probably has to do</p>
<p>with the dominant gripping that he does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not defensive gripping, it&rsquo;s offensive gripping,</p>
<p>but the dominant gripping.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>He controls the grips, he controls the movement</p>
<p>of the match as a result of that,</p>
<p>and then he creates his own openings.</p>
<p>So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.</p>
<p>And what you said, messy, I&rsquo;d like to call it sloppy, right?</p>
<p>A lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re falling on the ground a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get that body moving</p>
<p>and just with a simple pull motion.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s definitely found a way to do it.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also, I don&rsquo;t know, six foot eight.</p>
<p>He probably weighs 140 kilos.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big boy.</p>
<p>But he had this winning streak of just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long, but like over 100 matches.</p>
<p>And he lost at this Olympics that we just went through,</p>
<p>the 20, I don&rsquo;t even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the proper terminology.</p>
<p>Tokyo 2020 is what they call it.</p>
<p>Tokyo 2020, all right.</p>
<p>So he lost to Tamerlan Bashev.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always sad to see a sort of greatness</p>
<p>come to an end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Karelin in wrestling and Greco Roman.</p>
<p>Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?</p>
<p>Or is it just the way of life?</p>
<p>I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,</p>
<p>this run of dominance being stopped?</p>
<p>I think, I mean, it&rsquo;s obviously sad to see LFC</p>
<p>and champions succeed, especially people</p>
<p>that are good people.</p>
<p>And I think Teddy&rsquo;s a good person.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s some arrogant champions</p>
<p>that everybody would like to see lose</p>
<p>just because they don&rsquo;t wanna deal with their personality.</p>
<p>But I think Teddy&rsquo;s a very humble champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a people&rsquo;s champion.</p>
<p>You know, I think he&rsquo;s been privileged</p>
<p>and he makes good money from the sport of judo</p>
<p>and the French Federation has taken care of him well.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a lifelong judo icon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sad to see somebody like that get beat,</p>
<p>especially when this could have been his third Olympic title</p>
<p>and just put him in infamy.</p>
<p>So it was sad to see, but I think, you know,</p>
<p>every athlete goes through it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s what the Olympics is all about.</p>
<p>The great ones fall sometimes and.</p>
<p>Especially in judo, it&rsquo;s like so, like the margin of error.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess the other question I wanna ask here is,</p>
<p>in your sense, how difficult it is to not lose for so long?</p>
<p>It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no coming back and Ippon means it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>So how difficult is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to stay that dominant without question.</p>
<p>First of all, when you are the entire world</p>
<p>is training against you just to beat you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re studying every single movement.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re studying patterns.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to break it down</p>
<p>and find a flaw in your game.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s hunting for you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re the best in the world,</p>
<p>especially at the Olympics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one to beat you at.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s focused on you.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of pressure</p>
<p>on that athlete to perform.</p>
<p>You carry the flag for your country</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re at opening ceremonies sometimes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all spotlight is on you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s particularly hard when things don&rsquo;t go well early.</p>
<p>In other words, when you&rsquo;re expected to win</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden now you&rsquo;re in a hard fight</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going the way you want,</p>
<p>that pressure, the one who&rsquo;s the favorite</p>
<p>feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think the other ones are able to win it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never gotten a chance</p>
<p>to listen to Teddy Renner sort of explain ideas</p>
<p>behind his Judo.</p>
<p>Like I wonder what his mental game is like</p>
<p>because I think his English is pretty, not very good.</p>
<p>And so, and I just haven&rsquo;t seen good interviews,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always fascinating to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain great athletes</p>
<p>that are also great thinkers and speakers,</p>
<p>like the Satya brothers in wrestling.</p>
<p>Again, not meaning, that&rsquo;s on my to do list,</p>
<p>100%, I&rsquo;m going to Dagestan and talking to them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,</p>
<p>to think back, what were the systems involved?</p>
<p>Both on the technical, the training side,</p>
<p>and then the mental side.</p>
<p>Because to stay that dominant, just like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s studying to beat you.</p>
<p>And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.</p>
<p>So to be able to control them with your game</p>
<p>and the game that everybody knows is coming is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s behind that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s got to be, it feels like the mental game</p>
<p>is exceptionally important.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people underestimate</p>
<p>just how important that side is.</p>
<p>Being mentally prepared for victory,</p>
<p>mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s weak minded</p>
<p>that they can accomplish that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% confidence and belief in yourself.</p>
<p>If we take a big picture view then,</p>
<p>not necessarily Taylor Renner,</p>
<p>but if you want to go from the very beginning,</p>
<p>from day one of judo class to Olympic champion</p>
<p>or Olympic medalist, what does it take</p>
<p>to become an Olympic medalist in judo from start to finish?</p>
<p>Like how many different trajectories do you see?</p>
<p>Or is there some unifying principles?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it has to,</p>
<p>your journey is gonna depend a lot by where you&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>So a path that an American might take</p>
<p>versus somebody who&rsquo;s from Japan</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s from Europe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two very, three very distinct paths, right?</p>
<p>Because in Japan, it&rsquo;s part of the culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a system of excellence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s elementary school judo, there&rsquo;s junior high school,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s high school, there&rsquo;s collegiate,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Olympic and much like our wrestling is here</p>
<p>in the United States, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar, there&rsquo;s youth wrestling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s high school, there&rsquo;s NCAA</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s Olympic wrestling.</p>
<p>And when your country is a factory</p>
<p>of producing athletes at the highest level,</p>
<p>then all of those top athletes typically go back</p>
<p>into the sport and there&rsquo;s professions for them.</p>
<p>They have an opportunity to coach</p>
<p>at all those different levels.</p>
<p>And just the level of their game and the expertise</p>
<p>that all of them have, even down at the elementary level,</p>
<p>make their skill so solid.</p>
<p>And as a coach, in that situation,</p>
<p>you can just sit back and watch who stands out</p>
<p>as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,</p>
<p>you would need to craft.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to choose from a thousand people,</p>
<p>a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.</p>
<p>You have to actually, whatever the natural resources</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re given, craft them into a champion.</p>
<p>So if we look at that, the American way,</p>
<p>where you just have a person with a smile</p>
<p>show up to your dojo, says I want to be an Olympic medalist,</p>
<p>what process do you take them through?</p>
<p>The odds are really insurmountable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very high hill to climb.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only a few, there&rsquo;s only a few people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only a few coaches in this entire country</p>
<p>that really understand that process</p>
<p>and that can help people reach that level,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s been proven, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,</p>
<p>a fundamental base of an expectation</p>
<p>of what the training is gonna be.</p>
<p>And it has to be a level of professionalism</p>
<p>very, very early, where you&rsquo;re teaching</p>
<p>all the basic judo moves, all the basic fundamental</p>
<p>movements, posture, gripping.</p>
<p>Well, maybe gripping doesn&rsquo;t come in so early in the game,</p>
<p>but throwing methodology, movements,</p>
<p>niwaza position, standing fundamental throws.</p>
<p>And I think most importantly is really the work ethic,</p>
<p>just the way you&rsquo;re gonna train,</p>
<p>the intensity you&rsquo;re gonna train with,</p>
<p>the ability to, mindset of going to tournaments constantly.</p>
<p>In order to compete with the rest of the world,</p>
<p>our young kids need to be tested a lot when they&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>They have to be put through adversity</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t get put through adversity in training</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have that many good training partners.</p>
<p>So you get put through adversity in competition</p>
<p>and then we see what your weaknesses are</p>
<p>and we continue to make improvements on those.</p>
<p>But the journey is, it&rsquo;s long.</p>
<p>And until they&rsquo;re kind of at the teenage years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have to pretty much stay domestic, right?</p>
<p>Cause they gotta go through life as a normal kid,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve gotta be training in the dojo at least,</p>
<p>five days a week.</p>
<p>Sometimes they might wanna get an extra technical workout in</p>
<p>or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.</p>
<p>And then really at the teenage years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we really, we&rsquo;ve struggled in America</p>
<p>of keeping teens in the sport of Judo</p>
<p>as well as developing them properly.</p>
<p>Cause up until around the teenage years,</p>
<p>I think the Americans are on par with the rest of the world</p>
<p>in terms of technique and in terms of skill</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve proven we can compete with the rest of the world</p>
<p>up until that age.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where Japan and that&rsquo;s where the Europeans</p>
<p>and the countries that are strong in Judo,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they put a lot of time, energy and effort</p>
<p>is it to the teens where they have a great coaching staff,</p>
<p>they have good training camps with 800,</p>
<p>a thousand people going to them every single weekend.</p>
<p>When you say teens, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Do you mean literally like 13?</p>
<p>Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you really accelerate your development.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like in America, when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>like before nine, 10, 11, 12, you stick in Judo,</p>
<p>you can progress quite a bit.</p>
<p>But then I guess the other competition there,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re into two people doing stuff to each other</p>
<p>in a combative way, the other competitor</p>
<p>in America is wrestling.</p>
<p>So Judo almost primes you, like it teaches you</p>
<p>how to be a great wrestler as well.</p>
<p>And so then you have to have a hard decision</p>
<p>because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.</p>
<p>You have like a clear plan of where you&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>if you wanna be a wrestler.</p>
<p>With Judo, that plan is less clear.</p>
<p>So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, so when you&rsquo;re on your own with your coach,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s just a fascinating journey</p>
<p>because then it&rsquo;s just like the purity of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the coach and the athlete and the dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the dedication, the five, six,</p>
<p>seven days a week competing, what, once a month, twice a month.</p>
<p>Okay, but also, you probably don&rsquo;t have that conversation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you do.</p>
<p>Maybe you do, saying like, we&rsquo;re gonna do this</p>
<p>for the next eight years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do you ever sit down?</p>
<p>Would you just take it the David Goggins way,</p>
<p>which is like, let&rsquo;s just take it one step at a time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;re there in eight years.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Do you actually?</p>
<p>Like right now, you have to think about,</p>
<p>the Olympics is gonna be in Los Angeles in 2028.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Now would be the time, and now is the time,</p>
<p>to identify talent and get commitment out of students</p>
<p>that in seven years, you can make a US Olympic team</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna have a full team.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s gonna have 14 athletes compete in those games,</p>
<p>one in every weight class.</p>
<p>So now&rsquo;s the time, if you&rsquo;re gonna go on a journey</p>
<p>to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,</p>
<p>now would be the time to do it, you know?</p>
<p>And so what, you show up to the Pedro Judo Center</p>
<p>and how much drilling, how much technique,</p>
<p>strategy discussions, how much randori,</p>
<p>or like live sparring, how much conditioning</p>
<p>and strength training, how much of all that?</p>
<p>How much of cross training to other gyms</p>
<p>or something like that, traveling abroad?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about some aspects</p>
<p>of that system?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>You need it all.</p>
<p>What you just said, you need it all of it.</p>
<p>And we do do all of that.</p>
<p>Right now, we have a young group of kids at the Academy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see tonight.</p>
<p>Some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.</p>
<p>Are they good?</p>
<p>Yeah, really good.</p>
<p>Okay, can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right around your waist, so it&rsquo;ll be perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just young boys,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been training hard through COVID.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been, Travis and myself have been training them.</p>
<p>We share responsibilities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing randori like five nights a week.</p>
<p>We have them doing randori Tuesdays, Wednesdays,</p>
<p>Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays</p>
<p>is when they&rsquo;re doing randori.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming to the dojo Friday night</p>
<p>and Sunday night to do training.</p>
<p>We also have technical sessions for them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in school now, so it&rsquo;s a little bit challenging,</p>
<p>but they come five o clock in the afternoon</p>
<p>and they do a technical session.</p>
<p>Through COVID, they were coming every morning</p>
<p>doing technical sessions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a technical session?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an hour of repetitive throwing</p>
<p>or repetitive drilling to reinforce movements</p>
<p>that we deem important to our successful system.</p>
<p>So, niwaza positions, groundwork positions,</p>
<p>where we want them to be put in this position</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna drill it 50 times</p>
<p>with resistance in big groups,</p>
<p>doing drills over and over again,</p>
<p>picking apart the details of the technique</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re doing wrong,</p>
<p>showing them how to fix it.</p>
<p>But now, we&rsquo;ve done it so much</p>
<p>that now we can do a whole drill session with them</p>
<p>where they know all the different techniques</p>
<p>inside and out and they can move</p>
<p>from position to position really quickly.</p>
<p>Do they do it for a period of time,</p>
<p>like two minutes, five minutes,</p>
<p>or is it like one, two, they&rsquo;re actually counting?</p>
<p>No, sometimes it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>So sometimes we do it for reps,</p>
<p>sometimes we do it for time.</p>
<p>So sometimes it might be as many as they can do</p>
<p>in 60 seconds or as many as they can do in two minutes.</p>
<p>And sometimes it might just be,</p>
<p>I want you to do every position five times.</p>
<p>In terms of throws,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about it on a crash pad, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about free moving around the mat.</p>
<p>And just dynamically and just throwing.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>How many, because as I was mentioning to you offline,</p>
<p>Travis threw me a few times,</p>
<p>a lot of times when he was visiting in Austin,</p>
<p>and I just remembered,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately in my life,</p>
<p>having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,</p>
<p>with just cleanness of throw and the power,</p>
<p>and it was very nice.</p>
<p>I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that.</p>
<p>To throw a little shade at Craig Jones</p>
<p>with his current mat situation,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re very, they were quite thin.</p>
<p>And as Travis commented on,</p>
<p>and not just the thinness of the mats,</p>
<p>but they were laid on like concrete, right?</p>
<p>So I felt, it&rsquo;s like soft until it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But being thrown very cleanly,</p>
<p>I just felt like there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this is not gonna lead to injury, it was great.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t injury prone.</p>
<p>But then as I mentioned to you,</p>
<p>when a day or two after,</p>
<p>my entire leg, one of them, I guess it&rsquo;s the left leg,</p>
<p>was just black, a bruise.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t hurt too bad,</p>
<p>but it was just, the body&rsquo;s gotten soft.</p>
<p>So I guess the question I have is,</p>
<p>does the body get used to just that number of throws?</p>
<p>Just over time, being thrown thousands of times a month?</p>
<p>Unquestionably.</p>
<p>Your body gets used to it.</p>
<p>So it hardens, it gets really hard.</p>
<p>Which is why judo is hard to come back to</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve taken a long period of time off,</p>
<p>because your body is not used to that impact anymore.</p>
<p>I always found out that when I was training judo a lot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to shed weight and keep weight off,</p>
<p>because your body, it develops this layer of protection</p>
<p>on itself that it doesn&rsquo;t wanna give up.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sucking a lot of weight,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re frail.</p>
<p>So I always seem to retain weight more</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing hard judo training,</p>
<p>as opposed to losing weight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy when you go out for runs and things like that</p>
<p>to shed the water weight,</p>
<p>but to actually keep the pounds off was pretty hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, the body develops, like you said, a level of protection.</p>
<p>What about the randori?</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, again,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever had the opportunity to train</p>
<p>with folks at a high level.</p>
<p>In jiu jitsu, there&rsquo;s different gyms at different styles,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve noticed that at the highest levels,</p>
<p>people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more technical,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re moving at 100%,</p>
<p>but the power is not at 100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird little dance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really forcing stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more focused on the right timing,</p>
<p>the right positioning of hands and feet and body</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not forcing stuff in the way you would in competition,</p>
<p>like really the power.</p>
<p>Does that sound similar to you</p>
<p>for the way you try to do randori?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different styles of judo,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say the Japanese style,</p>
<p>the technical style of judo</p>
<p>is exactly what you just talked about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like two guys in pajamas, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving around,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to feel that movement,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s timing and finesse and technique</p>
<p>and fun and clean throws.</p>
<p>And when you train in Japan,</p>
<p>you can train 15 rounds of randori, five minute rounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 75 minutes of straight sparring.</p>
<p>You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ll get tired, of course.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fall a lot, you&rsquo;re gonna throw a lot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very free feeling,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s technical as you explained.</p>
<p>But then when you go to Europe</p>
<p>and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,</p>
<p>they are very physical.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that same finesse in their training</p>
<p>that they do in Japan.</p>
<p>In Europe, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed</p>
<p>to do eight rounds of randori in a night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so physically exhausting</p>
<p>because so much effort is going into just fighting</p>
<p>and fending off the gripping system</p>
<p>and the power of your opponent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re physically drained after eight rounds of randori.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a much different feel.</p>
<p>When you say Europe,</p>
<p>do you mean Germany, France, Britain, Russia?</p>
<p>Is there a lot?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of similarity</p>
<p>to all of those kinds of approaches.</p>
<p>The only difference would be Russia</p>
<p>that they do a lot more active drilling,</p>
<p>a lot more sequential movement training.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t focus as much on randori.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps</p>
<p>than you would in those other countries</p>
<p>we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.</p>
<p>What about in this kind of American system</p>
<p>where you have much less talent to work with?</p>
<p>Do you just select whatever works</p>
<p>for the particular athletes,</p>
<p>or do you have something you prefer in your system?</p>
<p>So you need a combination of all of it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna win at the Olympic level,</p>
<p>you have to be able to deal with the finesse of the Japanese,</p>
<p>the physicality of the Europeans.</p>
<p>You have to focus on the ground,</p>
<p>niwaza aspect, because a lot of people are weak there</p>
<p>in the world of the sport of judo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a chance to win.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve sort of developed our American system of judo,</p>
<p>at least for the last,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say probably the last 20 years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be the American system of judo,</p>
<p>which relies heavily on taking the individual</p>
<p>and whatever techniques they do,</p>
<p>perfecting those techniques and the combinations</p>
<p>and other throws that go with those throws,</p>
<p>but then implementing and overlaying an American system</p>
<p>of gripping, niwaza, conditioning, mentality,</p>
<p>training methodology, and game planning</p>
<p>to beat your opponents.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the secret sauce to success</p>
<p>for your Americans, because there&rsquo;s no way,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have eight partners to train with in a night</p>
<p>that are gonna give us good rounds, right?</p>
<p>We might have two, so we&rsquo;re gonna have the same guy</p>
<p>four times, those two people four, two times each.</p>
<p>Now I have four good rounds.</p>
<p>The rest of the rounds, I&rsquo;m not being pushed to the limit.</p>
<p>So we train differently.</p>
<p>And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.</p>
<p>When our athletes are preparing for competition,</p>
<p>for example, when Kayla or Travis</p>
<p>were preparing for competition,</p>
<p>we might only have 20 people in the whole gym</p>
<p>to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?</p>
<p>And of those 20 people,</p>
<p>maybe four of them are Travis&rsquo;s size.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s only one girl in the room for Kayla,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gotta train with guys.</p>
<p>And then the other ones are teenagers</p>
<p>that are too weak to train with either one of them.</p>
<p>So what we would do is just put together</p>
<p>four or five people that could give them a challenge</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d line them up and they would do a minute,</p>
<p>a minute, a minute, a minute,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.</p>
<p>That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t go five minutes hard,</p>
<p>but they can go one minute hard.</p>
<p>So it made their training much, much more intense,</p>
<p>much more physically demanding.</p>
<p>And then rinse and repeat that six times</p>
<p>or eight times in a night,</p>
<p>they just got 40 minutes of intense randori.</p>
<p>The person that was training with them that wasn&rsquo;t as good</p>
<p>only had to do six or eight minutes</p>
<p>of training the whole night, you know, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s so difficult because then you look</p>
<p>at like the Russian national team</p>
<p>and you have just the world champions and so,</p>
<p>or you even have like, what is it,</p>
<p>Tom Brands and Terry Brands in the wrestling system.</p>
<p>You have like these people, it&rsquo;s a small group of people,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all some of the best people in the world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going head to head.</p>
<p>And yeah, you don&rsquo;t necessarily get a good look</p>
<p>kind of a variety of styles, but just the quality is there.</p>
<p>And even that is missing for people your size in America,</p>
<p>because that is so difficult to work with,</p>
<p>which it makes Kayla&rsquo;s and makes Travis&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>that much more amazing.</p>
<p>You mentioned kind of picking whatever the set of techniques</p>
<p>the athlete is naturally good at or prefers or whatever.</p>
<p>How much specialization is there?</p>
<p>Maybe if I give you like two choices,</p>
<p>is it good to have like one throw</p>
<p>and try to become the best person in the world</p>
<p>at that throw, or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?</p>
<p>Like a variety of throws?</p>
<p>Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Seinagi,</p>
<p>that was his main throw, right?</p>
<p>But from that Ippon Seinagi, he had a variety</p>
<p>of other attacks he could do, you know,</p>
<p>that mixed it up so that you kept people guessing.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the Ippon Seinagi that was coming,</p>
<p>maybe it was the Koshi Gruma that he did,</p>
<p>or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto</p>
<p>that he did in combination.</p>
<p>So you typically have one main throw that you do.</p>
<p>For me, it was Tai Otoshi.</p>
<p>For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.</p>
<p>For Travis, it was his Ippon Seinagi.</p>
<p>But then you come up with a variety of other throws</p>
<p>that you do from the very same grip.</p>
<p>So whatever grip you take for your main throw,</p>
<p>you wanna develop, you know, an arsenal of attacks</p>
<p>that go in all different directions holding that same grip.</p>
<p>So you keep your opponent guessing as to what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>You know, because if they&rsquo;re just sitting on one technique</p>
<p>at the highest level of sport,</p>
<p>with the exception of a few, right?</p>
<p>We talked about Ono&rsquo;s Uchi Mata.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few,</p>
<p>most of the world catches on pretty quick</p>
<p>on how to beat you.</p>
<p>There is something to just sticking,</p>
<p>making sure you really dedicate to the main thing.</p>
<p>So for Travis, that would be like the main version</p>
<p>of his Seinagi.</p>
<p>Like really making sure you don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>to really put in the time on that.</p>
<p>Because I mean, one way to say it is</p>
<p>that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But also, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just, as a fan,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sad when like elite level athletes</p>
<p>in all like combat sports,</p>
<p>kind of start taking their main thing for granted.</p>
<p>Like they think, okay, I&rsquo;ve figured that part out.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll be working on all this whole system</p>
<p>on variations, on different setups,</p>
<p>on lefty versus, some like weird variation</p>
<p>as opposed to, you know what?</p>
<p>If you look at some of the best people ever,</p>
<p>they seem to have not cared about variations at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like literally,</p>
<p>they are more like Jiro James of Sushi</p>
<p>and like fine tuning their ear,</p>
<p>their ability to detect the minute movements</p>
<p>that give you an opening on that main thing.</p>
<p>And so the whole time you&rsquo;re just waiting for that throw,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like dancing with the like little bit of pressure</p>
<p>and like releasing the pressure, putting the pressure,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of off balance</p>
<p>and finding like the right moment to strike</p>
<p>and focusing on that.</p>
<p>Again, maybe that&rsquo;s just like a romanticization</p>
<p>of like the simplicity of that.</p>
<p>Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on a large scale,</p>
<p>but I just, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on that,</p>
<p>whether there is some value in still putting in</p>
<p>like tens of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.</p>
<p>Well, unquestionably that has to happen.</p>
<p>You still have to drill your main throw</p>
<p>and you have to fine tune it</p>
<p>and continue to do repetition after repetition</p>
<p>and throws on the crash pad or throws on the mat,</p>
<p>moving around, just explosive movements</p>
<p>doing your main technique.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna forget that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna put it to the side</p>
<p>and not practice it anymore.</p>
<p>It still has to be part of your repertoire</p>
<p>and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the sport of judo, makes you evolve.</p>
<p>When I look at, we talk about Koga from before, right?</p>
<p>And we talked about, he had a dynamic Ippon Seinagi</p>
<p>that nobody could stop for years and years and years.</p>
<p>But when people started to be unorthodox</p>
<p>and come down his back and cross grip him</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t get to the lapel,</p>
<p>he had to come up with something else.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing, now he did a Sode</p>
<p>or now he did a Tomoe Nagi,</p>
<p>which so he can, he added to his arsenal</p>
<p>to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not just that one trick pony.</p>
<p>They still couldn&rsquo;t stop his Ippon Seinagi</p>
<p>once he got that grip.</p>
<p>But if they stopped them from getting that grip</p>
<p>or putting two hands on the gi,</p>
<p>he had to go to something else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he did.</p>
<p>Does Travis&rsquo;s or Koga&rsquo;s Seinagi make sense to you?</p>
<p>That weird, so when I,</p>
<p>Because split hip, split hip.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know this,</p>
<p>but like I got into judo because of Travis.</p>
<p>I watched him at 2008 Olympics and I was,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about like, just not the cockiness,</p>
<p>but the confidence and just the refusal to quit,</p>
<p>the refusal to just, that energy,</p>
<p>whatever it connected with me is like,</p>
<p>oh, that guy&rsquo;s bad ass.</p>
<p>I want to be bad ass like that.</p>
<p>And then I also there happened to be in my university judo</p>
<p>and I got into it and just fell in love with the elegance</p>
<p>and the beauty and the power of the sport.</p>
<p>But also I started to mimic Travis&rsquo;s game, his and Koga&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then the instructors I worked with,</p>
<p>they said that&rsquo;s the wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,</p>
<p>no, that&rsquo;s not the wrong way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to do it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like the classic way</p>
<p>and you have to understand it and you have to learn it,</p>
<p>but this is not the wrong way.</p>
<p>Cause I was trying to find somebody</p>
<p>who understands this throw.</p>
<p>Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,</p>
<p>especially with Koga, the way you&rsquo;re able,</p>
<p>the quickness with which you can strike,</p>
<p>the fact that you can stand on the feet</p>
<p>and the elevation you can get and the power you can get</p>
<p>has certain throws, just like Uchimata</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it looks effortless.</p>
<p>But like the standing Seinagi with a split hip,</p>
<p>it just looks powerful because there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re stepping into them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lifting the opponent and they still have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not surprised, they&rsquo;re now like helpless.</p>
<p>Right, their feet are fluttering in the air.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just this pause</p>
<p>and then just big slam.</p>
<p>With the Uchimata, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what hit you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Taitoshi is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a surprise.</p>
<p>Like, oh shit, I&rsquo;m now on my back.</p>
<p>And so I just love that throw,</p>
<p>but like it didn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Like when trying to explain it to others,</p>
<p>when trying to learn, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to me</p>
<p>how it works.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to you?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>I was born a Judoka, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve lived this stuff since I was an infant</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen every style and every technique.</p>
<p>The split hip Saiyan Aiki is difficult to learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to learn than the basic form,</p>
<p>but it is powerful and it does, upon entry,</p>
<p>both of your opponent&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>leave the mat at the same time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got them.</p>
<p>Once you enter, you&rsquo;ve got them.</p>
<p>You just gotta finish, right?</p>
<p>You just gotta lock them and turn and go.</p>
<p>So it makes sense to me.</p>
<p>My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.</p>
<p>Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.</p>
<p>We have kids at the school today</p>
<p>that we teach the split hip Saiyan Aiki, same way,</p>
<p>because it is that dynamic, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t drop to the ground and roll and turn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the classic form</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re giving way to your opponent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, you go pick the guy up in the air</p>
<p>and then you slam him, so.</p>
<p>Okay, beautiful.</p>
<p>So maybe on a small tangent,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about elite level athletes</p>
<p>in terms of Randori, in terms of like drilling.</p>
<p>For more recreational athletes,</p>
<p>like, you know, I have personally that situation going on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other people</p>
<p>that are just recreationally training Judo.</p>
<p>How do you recommend they improve Judo?</p>
<p>Like if I wanted to compete a bunch</p>
<p>and do reasonable with a particular set of throws,</p>
<p>say the split Saiyan Aiki,</p>
<p>so how do you do the Randori?</p>
<p>Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?</p>
<p>Do you, like, what do you recommend?</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s two recreational people</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>One is somebody who wants to learn Judo</p>
<p>and become good at Judo,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily want to compete,</p>
<p>but just wants to get better.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s not enough emphasis</p>
<p>in this country on paying attention</p>
<p>to that type of student.</p>
<p>Everybody pushes them to competition.</p>
<p>But in reality, there&rsquo;s a huge audience of people out there</p>
<p>that would love to learn Judo</p>
<p>and be very proficient at Judo</p>
<p>and have the skills to go execute if they ever needed it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a class</p>
<p>and there should be a program for that athlete.</p>
<p>And that athlete does not need to do Randori.</p>
<p>Like the sport of Judo is physical enough</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re picking somebody up all the time</p>
<p>and moving their body weight around the mat all the time,</p>
<p>where you can get very physically strong,</p>
<p>very physically fit.</p>
<p>Technically, you&rsquo;ll be better than somebody</p>
<p>that does Randori more than you</p>
<p>because if you learn good technique</p>
<p>and you learn the movement and you learn the feel</p>
<p>and you learn the timing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually be a better athlete</p>
<p>than the person that just focuses on Randori</p>
<p>who does ugly technique and wins with force.</p>
<p>So we have a recreational class at our school</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t do any Randori.</p>
<p>They have an option afterwards</p>
<p>if they want to stay for 15 minutes</p>
<p>or stay for 30 minutes</p>
<p>where they can participate in Randori.</p>
<p>But most of the adult students choose not to</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re already so tired from the other hour class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good workout.</p>
<p>Right, they&rsquo;re already dripping sweat.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already like, if you work hard and drill hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an intense workout, you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a specific set of program,</p>
<p>I should say, at every academy.</p>
<p>And then if you want to get good and you want to compete,</p>
<p>then to me, once you have your techniques,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s learning how to implement a good gripping system</p>
<p>to put yourself in a position</p>
<p>where you can always dominate the grips,</p>
<p>control the movement, initiate the reactions</p>
<p>from your opponent,</p>
<p>and then have the opportunity to attack and score.</p>
<p>And I think that when people train with,</p>
<p>or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the first thing they say is, I can&rsquo;t attack.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to attack.</p>
<p>Because positionally, they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where to put their hands.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to hold the gi properly.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they have an inferior grip,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know how to get into better positions</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t attack.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big part of the game</p>
<p>that not a lot of people really understand.</p>
<p>So you really, even for recreational competitors,</p>
<p>you really need to have a gripping system.</p>
<p>You need to understand the gripping system.</p>
<p>If you want to win.</p>
<p>I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going, I don&rsquo;t have fun getting beat up</p>
<p>or losing in competitions.</p>
<p>I enjoy the&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s the winning or the losing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I think this is what,</p>
<p>because I competed a lot in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>and in Judo, it feels like,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t have a gripping system,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re not even playing Judo</p>
<p>against the good black belts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even trying because they have,</p>
<p>they get a certain kind of grip,</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a good answer for that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not even fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like even losing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t even show up to play</p>
<p>is what it feels like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, and I think that is a big gap</p>
<p>in knowledge, actually, in Judo schools,</p>
<p>is the gripping part.</p>
<p>When you first go out to do Judo, right?</p>
<p>You, the first thing you have to do</p>
<p>is you have to grab your opponent, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip.</p>
<p>Just take a grip.</p>
<p>Well, sometimes if you take a grip,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a worse position than not having a grip at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way,</p>
<p>your opponent can attack you, but you can&rsquo;t attack him.</p>
<p>So why would you ever do that grip</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s only to your detriment, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, and the way you grip does set up</p>
<p>what attacks you can do as well.</p>
<p>So that is a huge part.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined</p>
<p>and only always outgrip your opponent</p>
<p>and only be able to do throws</p>
<p>when you have a superior grip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that to be able to put the grips together</p>
<p>with the throws and understand the movements</p>
<p>is gonna make you that much ahead of the game.</p>
<p>So if we take a step to our previous discussion</p>
<p>of going from zero to hero.</p>
<p>So going from the early days through the teenage years</p>
<p>to winning an Olympic medal.</p>
<p>So we mentioned a lot of training,</p>
<p>the dedication of the training, the competing,</p>
<p>what other elements are there?</p>
<p>The mental side is visualization,</p>
<p>believing that you could perform at that level.</p>
<p>So what else can you say about that?</p>
<p>I think that comes at the highest level,</p>
<p>the visualization, the success,</p>
<p>that comes at the highest level.</p>
<p>I think in the teen years, there&rsquo;s the experience,</p>
<p>just plays a huge role in getting to train</p>
<p>with other people.</p>
<p>Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe.</p>
<p>We have to feel the European style of judo.</p>
<p>You have to understand that physicality.</p>
<p>They grip very differently.</p>
<p>They put you in very unorthodox positions.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know how to deal with that,</p>
<p>you get thrown before you even have a chance</p>
<p>to try your own throws.</p>
<p>So it takes a lot of that experience</p>
<p>and understanding what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then you also need to get that physicality.</p>
<p>You need to be strong and hard, I would say,</p>
<p>by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you need to go to Asia</p>
<p>and you need to train in Japan</p>
<p>because you need to feel that free flowing judo</p>
<p>for your technical side.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that I was able to benefit from.</p>
<p>My dad was a coach who said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Listen, I&rsquo;ve taken you as far as I can take you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I want you to go to the next level.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he sent me to England with Neil Adams,</p>
<p>who was an Olympic silver medalist and was a world champion,</p>
<p>had a great ground game and was good at gripping</p>
<p>and actually did Tai Otoshi, which is the throw I did.</p>
<p>So my dad said, &lsquo;&lsquo;I want you to go learn from Neil.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I ended up going to England</p>
<p>probably eight to 10 times in my career</p>
<p>and spending a good amount of time there</p>
<p>training at the Neil Adams Academy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.</p>
<p>What do you make of that guy?</p>
<p>Just a brief pause.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like the, like Morgan Freeman</p>
<p>is the voice of like March of the Penguins</p>
<p>and any other nature documentary.</p>
<p>And Neil Adams is, there&rsquo;s very few sports</p>
<p>that have a Neil Adams, I would say,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s legitimately, maybe like Joe Rogan</p>
<p>is that from mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Also the passion is conveyed so well.</p>
<p>Like many times I&rsquo;ll watch just because he&rsquo;s talking.</p>
<p>So who is he?</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to train with him,</p>
<p>to learn from him, who is Neil Adams?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine.</p>
<p>He is?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a mentor.</p>
<p>Like I said, I lived and trained</p>
<p>at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England</p>
<p>since I was like 16 years old.</p>
<p>I went and visited him for the first time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one who originally taught me</p>
<p>how to do jujigatami and the way that I do jujigatami.</p>
<p>I trained with him.</p>
<p>He was just retired.</p>
<p>He was in his early thirties when I first went out there.</p>
<p>And so I trained with him many times</p>
<p>and over the years he was a mentor.</p>
<p>Great person, cares about people,</p>
<p>cares about the sport of judo, had a good little club</p>
<p>that was a fitness club.</p>
<p>And it was judo, it was fitness.</p>
<p>It used to go there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d show up at that place at like seven in the morning.</p>
<p>And the first thing we would do is we&rsquo;d go for a run.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d either be running mountains</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;d be doing a five mile run</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;d be doing something at the park.</p>
<p>We were doing sprints and buddy carries and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And then at 9 a.m. we&rsquo;d have a technical session</p>
<p>with Neil Adams where he would, for an hour and a half,</p>
<p>we would drill techniques and learn positions.</p>
<p>And it was no randori.</p>
<p>It was that sequential drilling</p>
<p>that we talked about before, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re reinforcing your two or three attacks</p>
<p>to set up your main attack.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re on the ground,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through repetitions of certain movements.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.</p>
<p>And then in the evening,</p>
<p>we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams Club</p>
<p>or we would all get in a car</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d drive to another location</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d go train at another club</p>
<p>that might be an hour away.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;d be 50 bodies there to train with.</p>
<p>And each night we&rsquo;d go to a different dojo.</p>
<p>And so it would be all day at the club</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d do that for like three weeks straight.</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;d do was train.</p>
<p>Do you know how he became the voice of judo?</p>
<p>Do you have an understanding of what he&rsquo;s thinking is</p>
<p>around how much he dedicates to himself</p>
<p>to just commentating on judo?</p>
<p>I imagine the amount of research required,</p>
<p>but also just like psychologically,</p>
<p>just the excitement he has in his voice.</p>
<p>It takes work to do that.</p>
<p>Do you have an understanding</p>
<p>of like what his vision is with that?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.</p>
<p>Very passionate and loud and funny.</p>
<p>And the Brits are very funny to begin with.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s very charismatic.</p>
<p>But I think after coaching, he tried coaching.</p>
<p>He coached the country of Wales for a while.</p>
<p>He tried coaching stints in other countries.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success on the coaching side</p>
<p>developing an Olympic champion.</p>
<p>I know that was a goal of his that he was a world champion.</p>
<p>I think it was 1981.</p>
<p>He won two silver medals in the Olympic games himself.</p>
<p>He went on to coach for a while</p>
<p>and had some political issues</p>
<p>with the country of England for a while.</p>
<p>And then left England and went to Wales.</p>
<p>And I think he had a coaching stint</p>
<p>somewhere else as well.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success coaching in the sport</p>
<p>with athletes, not at the highest level.</p>
<p>Had a great national team and things like that.</p>
<p>He was really good at teaching his technique to others</p>
<p>because he helped me a lot.</p>
<p>But running a program, I think was difficult for him.</p>
<p>The boys not listening and not having that same kind</p>
<p>of passion and intensity that he&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I bonded well with him</p>
<p>because I was all in, right?</p>
<p>I went there and whatever he said, I did.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care how hard, I didn&rsquo;t care how long.</p>
<p>I just wanted to get as good as I could.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why he was a good mentor for me.</p>
<p>But now in terms of a commentator, he&rsquo;s very cerebral.</p>
<p>He loves judo, he researches it nonstop.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got that great voice</p>
<p>and he knows how to bring life to the game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And now this is who he is, right?</p>
<p>He does judo full time, this is his job.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a small, before we return to the actual sport,</p>
<p>the coaching and the sport,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of a political question.</p>
<p>I did a whole rant before Travis episode.</p>
<p>I love Neil Adams&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>I love watching judo.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really disappointing to me that the IOC</p>
<p>and whoever is responsible, I don&rsquo;t understand this,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t make it easy for people</p>
<p>to watch the Olympics in replay for years after.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t watch Travis&rsquo;s matches.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t watch, like they make it very difficult</p>
<p>to watch stuff online.</p>
<p>So what happened is I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode</p>
<p>and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.</p>
<p>And it was like one minute of like a small overlay</p>
<p>of the video as we&rsquo;re talking through it,</p>
<p>like stepping through it.</p>
<p>And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,</p>
<p>the whole four hour conversation</p>
<p>because of that one minute little clip.</p>
<p>And the way it got taken down automatically</p>
<p>is because the IOC has that video uploaded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set to private, but it&rsquo;s uploaded.</p>
<p>So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re asking for money or whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not showing it anywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not showing it through their own service.</p>
<p>Like an NBC Olympics or so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many great human stories</p>
<p>that the Olympics reveals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not made easily accessible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Olympics charter is you want to,</p>
<p>I think the actual line is to ensure the fullest coverage</p>
<p>and the widest possible audience in the world</p>
<p>for the Olympic games.</p>
<p>And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic games,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting any of that.</p>
<p>Do you have an understanding of why that is?</p>
<p>Like why we can&rsquo;t watch Kayla&rsquo;s matches,</p>
<p>Travis&rsquo;s matches super easily,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re willing to pay money for it.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t go on the International Judo Federation</p>
<p>website right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>So the only thing they have is for certain,</p>
<p>for example, Teddy Rene match he lost.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a dramatic thing.</p>
<p>So the one thing they have is for certain sports</p>
<p>at the highest level, like gymnastics,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have a highlight,</p>
<p>which is the most frustrating thing to me.</p>
<p>Because this is what I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to prevent myself from going on a rant.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t just want to see a two minute highlight</p>
<p>of a historic moment.</p>
<p>They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,</p>
<p>the nerves, the fear, the confidence.</p>
<p>You see the buildup to the event,</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s a gymnastic, whatever, floor routine.</p>
<p>Like their name is announced, they&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>the coat, then they cut to the coach,</p>
<p>and the coach with anticipation,</p>
<p>and then go to the athlete.</p>
<p>You want the full 10 minute thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a two minute highlight</p>
<p>of what happened like last second or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the magic of that full story.</p>
<p>Like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of the Olympics.</p>
<p>The both the drama and the triumph</p>
<p>that happens in those moments.</p>
<p>And the fact that you can&rsquo;t relive that.</p>
<p>Like Travis had a bunch of those, right?</p>
<p>Like he had a bunch of times he faced like world champions,</p>
<p>he won and lost, and just, it&rsquo;s always close,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always dramatic.</p>
<p>And none of those are available except like</p>
<p>maybe the one where he beat Armbard,</p>
<p>or whatever the submission was, I forgot.</p>
<p>The choke, yeah, the Georgian.</p>
<p>But most things are not.</p>
<p>Usain Bolt, the full races,</p>
<p>not all of his races are available online.</p>
<p>The race with the Italian winning the 100 meter track race,</p>
<p>this Olympics is not only highlight is available</p>
<p>from what I saw, I didn&rsquo;t look too hard.</p>
<p>So like, but the fact that it&rsquo;s not super easily accessible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to pay money even,</p>
<p>but probably should be for free, is heartbreaking to me.</p>
<p>Because to me, the Olympics is like some of the best</p>
<p>of humanity.</p>
<p>Just like, again, the hardship they have to overcome.</p>
<p>So like the losses are really powerful.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s such heartbreak,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like the triumph.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re losing history.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re losing history is what you are,</p>
<p>of all the magical moments of your sport, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sin.</p>
<p>I got to blame it on television rights and money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States</p>
<p>and globally, whatever the main carriers are</p>
<p>and all the other nations that are dictating</p>
<p>what can be replayed and what can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>I made a DVD or a video when I first retired</p>
<p>from the sport.</p>
<p>It was called Fury on the Mat.</p>
<p>It was kind of my story, right?</p>
<p>And I did it with a friend who was a videographer</p>
<p>and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage</p>
<p>and Olympic footage and somebody said to me,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use that Olympic footage.</p>
<p>And I was young and I had just retired.</p>
<p>I said, what do you mean I can&rsquo;t use the Olympic footage?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the television footage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my footage.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then they said, no, if it has Olympics in it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s anything to do with the Olympics,</p>
<p>the USOC owns it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I said, okay, well, they said,</p>
<p>well, you should get to send it to them</p>
<p>and let them review it.</p>
<p>So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.</p>
<p>I got a thing back that said,</p>
<p>if you want to use this footage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be like $30,000.</p>
<p>And I said, man, it&rsquo;s only like three minutes.</p>
<p>I spliced it up as much as I could</p>
<p>and I only have highlights in there.</p>
<p>And then I said, come on.</p>
<p>I went back and I negotiated with them.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I still had to pay like $15,000</p>
<p>just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, you wouldn&rsquo;t even have that film</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t compete in it.</p>
<p>You know, like you can&rsquo;t, you know.</p>
<p>So it was a struggle.</p>
<p>This is the different,</p>
<p>like you have the same in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain organizations, IBJJF</p>
<p>or like Flow Grappling and Flow Wrestling.</p>
<p>I understand, I think when it&rsquo;s a business,</p>
<p>it might make sense.</p>
<p>First of all, you should actually be good</p>
<p>at being a business and making money,</p>
<p>which is why for me, the IOC doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Like it should be accessible, but it would cost money.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>Like would I have to email them for this footage</p>
<p>and pay $30,000?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, but the question is,</p>
<p>like the way you run a business</p>
<p>is you make that frictionless.</p>
<p>Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30,</p>
<p>you make it frictionless and easy to pay that money.</p>
<p>But anyway, I understand why that might be the case</p>
<p>with Flow Grappling,</p>
<p>but to me, the Olympics is a special thing.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, like you said, it is history.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>like even the world championships don&rsquo;t compare.</p>
<p>I understand they&rsquo;re really important,</p>
<p>but Olympics is history.</p>
<p>And the stories should certainly belong to the athletes</p>
<p>if they want to do like Fury on the Mat</p>
<p>to do their own story,</p>
<p>or like on a podcast to talk about the most tragic moment</p>
<p>of their career.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed or no?</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to go to the Olympic committee.</p>
<p>The US Olympic committee is the place I would start</p>
<p>because the US controls the worldwide market</p>
<p>when it comes to television.</p>
<p>We pay the most for our television rights.</p>
<p>Our sponsors pay the most for their rights</p>
<p>to be associated with the best team in the world,</p>
<p>which is the United States, right?</p>
<p>So all the money starts here.</p>
<p>I gotta believe there has to be a way to get that footage</p>
<p>that should be accessible to the sports themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s not, then it&rsquo;s because of dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the sport itself is not willing to pay enough money</p>
<p>to have it on its, accessible to its audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too cost prohibitive for them to do it.</p>
<p>No, but I think it&rsquo;s also, unfortunately,</p>
<p>might be some mixture of incompetence</p>
<p>and just an old way of doing things</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made</p>
<p>on television rights where you live show the event, right?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s not being leveraged is the huge amount of money</p>
<p>that could be made on the replay.</p>
<p>This is what people don&rsquo;t understand is,</p>
<p>do you know how many times, just the tens of millions</p>
<p>of times that people watch individual events years from now?</p>
<p>You watch like all the videos on YouTube,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still getting plays.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of views on stuff</p>
<p>that happened 10 years ago, 15 years ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful and there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity</p>
<p>to make a ton of money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re necessarily greedy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also just not good at being greedy.</p>
<p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not the tradition.</p>
<p>Think about it though, it&rsquo;s not traditional, right?</p>
<p>For television studios, it&rsquo;s nontraditional</p>
<p>to go to online streaming, to online access to information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard, right?</p>
<p>Because everybody&rsquo;s doing it now, but it&rsquo;s not typical.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it requires for the IOC</p>
<p>to operate outside their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely hope that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And since Travis&rsquo;s video got taken down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious they have it.</p>
<p>They have it on their YouTube channel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I hope that they will just release it.</p>
<p>And for money, for whatever, but release it</p>
<p>and have that history not be erased, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be wonderful if athletes could buy.</p>
<p>Even if you could buy your own footage,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use it commercially, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but you can buy your own matches</p>
<p>and have them available for yourself</p>
<p>or package the footage, it&rsquo;d be awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>That is quite heartbreaking for me,</p>
<p>so I wanted to talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to you as an athlete real quick.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You represented the United States at four Olympics,</p>
<p>winning a bronze medal at two of them.</p>
<p>Who or what was the toughest match or moment</p>
<p>you had in those years?</p>
<p>Maybe a moment that defined you,</p>
<p>that you remember as being</p>
<p>particularly defining in your career.</p>
<p>I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in 96,</p>
<p>because up to that moment,</p>
<p>the United States team had not won a medal,</p>
<p>had not fought for a medal in the games.</p>
<p>We were on our home turf.</p>
<p>It was my second Olympic games, right?</p>
<p>So I had competed in 92 and I had won two matches</p>
<p>and lost in the third round in Barcelona.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make the podium.</p>
<p>I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.</p>
<p>But the gold, silver, and bronze medalist</p>
<p>at that Olympics in Barcelona were all guys that I had beat.</p>
<p>In fact, two of them I was undefeated against</p>
<p>in my entire career,</p>
<p>the Brazilian and the Cuban I had never lost to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I knew I was capable of being</p>
<p>on the podium at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>When 96 came around, I was 25 years old.</p>
<p>I was fairly in my prime.</p>
<p>I had lived in Japan for six months.</p>
<p>My technique was at a high level.</p>
<p>I was amongst the best in the world.</p>
<p>I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.</p>
<p>It was right before the match</p>
<p>I was supposed to fight against Japan.</p>
<p>So I was anticipating the match against Japan</p>
<p>and I got beat by the Mongolian.</p>
<p>So that was kind of a letdown.</p>
<p>But the match for the bronze in front of the hometown crowd,</p>
<p>all of my family, all of my friends,</p>
<p>everybody who had ever helped me in the sport</p>
<p>were in the stands that day,</p>
<p>including all my teammates at Brown University</p>
<p>that were on the wrestling team</p>
<p>and little, my uncles, my aunts,</p>
<p>everybody was in the stands, right?</p>
<p>So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m getting goosebumps right now talking about it.</p>
<p>But it was a match against the Brazilian</p>
<p>for the bronze medal.</p>
<p>I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times</p>
<p>before that.</p>
<p>And I found myself down in the match.</p>
<p>He actually countered me.</p>
<p>I came in my Taiyo Toshi and he was waiting for it</p>
<p>and he counted me and he scored a yuko against me.</p>
<p>So I was losing the fight,</p>
<p>came down to about the last minute in the match</p>
<p>and I was just tucking in my gi</p>
<p>and fixing my thing and gathering my thoughts together.</p>
<p>And the whole crowd just started chanting,</p>
<p>USA, USA, USA.</p>
<p>And I like literally like got so much energy.</p>
<p>I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,</p>
<p>I came in my Taiyo Toshi again.</p>
<p>He stepped off the Taiyo Toshi.</p>
<p>I threw him with duchimada for Ippon.</p>
<p>I won my first Olympic medal</p>
<p>in front of the hometown crowd.</p>
<p>Everybody went bananas.</p>
<p>The United States judo team had our first medal</p>
<p>from the Olympics.</p>
<p>It ended up being the only Olympic medal</p>
<p>we won at that games.</p>
<p>But it was like a magical moment that defined my career</p>
<p>and solidified myself in like history where,</p>
<p>hey, now I get to step up on the Olympic podium</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m Olympic medalist.</p>
<p>And to me, that was my defining moment.</p>
<p>And after that, I was sold.</p>
<p>Like man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.</p>
<p>I wanna win a gold medal.</p>
<p>I want this feeling all over again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if I have to wait four years, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>In your career, like moments like that,</p>
<p>do you think you love winning or hate losing more?</p>
<p>So do you live for those moments</p>
<p>or are you more driven by just how much you hate losing?</p>
<p>So in order to be a champion,</p>
<p>my belief is that you have to hate losing</p>
<p>more than you like winning.</p>
<p>Hate losing more than you like winning.</p>
<p>But I live for those moments when you do win.</p>
<p>And what excited me the most in my career</p>
<p>when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.</p>
<p>I loved the spotlight being on me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of too many times in my career,</p>
<p>of course there were a few,</p>
<p>but there weren&rsquo;t too many times where the chips were down,</p>
<p>like the lights were on and I didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Like it was, I might&rsquo;ve lost early in the day</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t make it to the finals</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t make it to the medal rounds.</p>
<p>But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.</p>
<p>I have a ton of bronzes,</p>
<p>which means the lights are on and I won</p>
<p>and I have very few silvers and very few fifths.</p>
<p>So I either lost in the early rounds</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t make it to the medal rounds in my younger days</p>
<p>or the spotlight came and I really shined.</p>
<p>Cause if you look, I don&rsquo;t know how many silvers,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t very many silver medals in my career</p>
<p>that I won.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So I just loved that moment.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel pressure.</p>
<p>I loved the crowd.</p>
<p>I loved being in the spotlight.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have, I wasn&rsquo;t nervous when it came to the finals</p>
<p>or I knew I was getting a medal.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You know, so it was just me against the other guy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I always saw it.</p>
<p>And I just loved that moment.</p>
<p>So your dad was your coach.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get to meet him tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of a legend in the sport.</p>
<p>So how has your dad helped you as a coach,</p>
<p>as an athlete, as a human being throughout the years?</p>
<p>Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person</p>
<p>you will ever meet in your life.</p>
<p>Brutally honest.</p>
<p>He will tell you, if you are fat,</p>
<p>he will tell you you&rsquo;re fat, right, to your face.</p>
<p>He wants you to get better.</p>
<p>He wants you to be healthy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t want you to die of obesity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way he is.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t do well, he will not sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>He will let you know what you didn&rsquo;t do right.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the ultimate litmus test.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Second is, he is the most passionate, caring, deep,</p>
<p>always thinking about, very cerebral,</p>
<p>very like a student of the game,</p>
<p>somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,</p>
<p>helping me improve, and always look for what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of training,</p>
<p>I think that he&rsquo;s probably the most brilliant human</p>
<p>when it comes to preparing an athlete physically,</p>
<p>not necessarily mentally, physically, for success.</p>
<p>When all the chips are down,</p>
<p>that athlete will be ready that day,</p>
<p>and he has a system of training and preparing</p>
<p>and getting the athlete to peak for performance.</p>
<p>You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, because I vaguely remember Kayla Harrison</p>
<p>talking about her preparation being very difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>At the same, you go back and ask Ronda Rousey</p>
<p>about her career, right?</p>
<p>My dad was her coach.</p>
<p>My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,</p>
<p>got her up, ran her in the morning,</p>
<p>had her downstairs in the basement of his house,</p>
<p>training with the weights.</p>
<p>We brought a Russian girl in.</p>
<p>She did throws on his cement outside</p>
<p>with the little crash pad.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Threw the Russian girl a hundred times that morning,</p>
<p>and then every night came to Boston,</p>
<p>to the training center in Wakefield,</p>
<p>trained at night, and went back and slept at my dad&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.</p>
<p>And he did the same with Kayla.</p>
<p>He did the same with me.</p>
<p>His passion is producing athletes at the highest level,</p>
<p>and he knows how to do it.</p>
<p>And then the one side of my dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coaching where I think there&rsquo;s a flaw or a weakness</p>
<p>is on the mental preparation side of the game.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t somebody that was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he,</p>
<p>maybe because he wasn&rsquo;t an Olympic champion himself</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t a world champion,</p>
<p>he lacked the confidence in helping others be more confident.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s more of a,</p>
<p>this is what you need to work on type of thing.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how to build the athletes up</p>
<p>to make them feel invincible.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I was able to give all of the athletes,</p>
<p>to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,</p>
<p>knowing that you&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>before you step out of the mat,</p>
<p>knowing that we&rsquo;ve earned the right to victory,</p>
<p>seeing success in your mind,</p>
<p>having a positive mantra that you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best in the world, nobody&rsquo;s beating me today,</p>
<p>type of feeling.</p>
<p>So you go out there feeling like King Kong</p>
<p>when you step on the mat,</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s gonna stop you.</p>
<p>And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lot more technical.</p>
<p>My dad is good at letting,</p>
<p>identifying what they need to do for their techniques</p>
<p>and what, in strategy, how to beat opponents</p>
<p>and putting game plans together.</p>
<p>So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not gonna let the athlete be soft</p>
<p>when they enter the highest,</p>
<p>the most difficult competitions of their career.</p>
<p>So on the mental side, what&rsquo;s mental preparation look like?</p>
<p>Like how many years before the Olympics</p>
<p>do you start helping an athlete believe</p>
<p>that they can win an Olympic medal?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s gotta be a seed</p>
<p>in that athlete&rsquo;s brain, something they wanna do, right?</p>
<p>Nobody can quickly get there, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long process.</p>
<p>But if your goal, if you&rsquo;re national champion</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve proven yourself to win</p>
<p>in some international tournaments,</p>
<p>and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,</p>
<p>then defining it as, hey, I wanna be on the Olympic team,</p>
<p>that would be the first step into getting ready.</p>
<p>And I always make them put it on paper.</p>
<p>If it really is your goal,</p>
<p>then you show me that it&rsquo;s your goal</p>
<p>and put it on paper and commit to it.</p>
<p>I wanna be Olympic medalist,</p>
<p>I wanna be Olympic champion,</p>
<p>I wanna go to the Olympics.</p>
<p>World team member, maybe junior world team member,</p>
<p>whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level.</p>
<p>But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s accomplish these other things first, right?</p>
<p>Because if we can accomplish these other things,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,</p>
<p>which is the Olympics.</p>
<p>For somebody like Kayla, for example,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t say that she wanted to be Olympic champion</p>
<p>when she first came here in 2005, right?</p>
<p>We wanted to become national champion,</p>
<p>then we wanted to be on the world team,</p>
<p>then we wanted to be a world medalist.</p>
<p>Then our sights were set on the Olympics</p>
<p>or the Olympic gold.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s having those clearly defined goals</p>
<p>that are attainable.</p>
<p>Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch,</p>
<p>but they have to be attainable.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be just a pipe dream.</p>
<p>But once you put it to paper and you think it&rsquo;s achievable,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s mapping the plan to get there.</p>
<p>Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself</p>
<p>as an Olympic champion or national champion?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, and you should do it</p>
<p>either every night before you go to bed</p>
<p>or before every training session</p>
<p>or after every training session.</p>
<p>One of those three times it should,</p>
<p>or first thing you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>because it may be to help some people,</p>
<p>it motivates them to go do what it is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to do in the day.</p>
<p>But the process of visualization is, to me,</p>
<p>is closing your eyes for a few moments.</p>
<p>Your brain works really, really fast, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually picturing the day in its entirety,</p>
<p>from start to finish,</p>
<p>from the moment you wake up and you step on the scale</p>
<p>to the moment you have your breakfast</p>
<p>and you go through your morning routine.</p>
<p>Like live the day that you&rsquo;re gonna have at the Olympics.</p>
<p>So whatever it is you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the Olympic day, for example.</p>
<p>Picture yourself making weight,</p>
<p>picture yourself, who you&rsquo;re around, eating your breakfast,</p>
<p>having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing.</p>
<p>This is a real day, make it real.</p>
<p>Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,</p>
<p>getting on the bus, driving to the venue,</p>
<p>feel what it&rsquo;s like walking into the stadium</p>
<p>for the first time, going to the warmup area,</p>
<p>seeing your drawer up on the sheet,</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;re gonna fight that day,</p>
<p>watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine,</p>
<p>walking out of the shoot, into the venue,</p>
<p>going to do that first fight.</p>
<p>Picture the moment of throwing your opponent,</p>
<p>coming off the mat, high fiving the coach,</p>
<p>getting ready for your second fight.</p>
<p>Like live the day from start to finish</p>
<p>and make it as real as possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all the way to the moment where you&rsquo;ve just won</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re raising your arms in celebration,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bowing, you&rsquo;re hugging your opponent,</p>
<p>you come off the mat, you hug your coach,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running around the stadium with the flag,</p>
<p>you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,</p>
<p>Olympic champion, Jimmy Pedro,</p>
<p>like you heard the moment,</p>
<p>the medal being put around your neck,</p>
<p>picture the people coming up on the podium with you,</p>
<p>arms around them, taking the pictures.</p>
<p>Like the more real you can make it,</p>
<p>even before it ever happens, right?</p>
<p>When you do that enough times,</p>
<p>I feel that like pathways get created for you</p>
<p>so that when your body gets to that moment,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been here before, this is it,</p>
<p>this is my moment, this is what I pictured my whole life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not nervous, because I&rsquo;ve seen this,</p>
<p>this is gonna happen, I believe it&rsquo;s possible, right?</p>
<p>And I believe the athletes that do that</p>
<p>and make it real enough that when they get to that moment,</p>
<p>they go right through, there&rsquo;s no hesitation.</p>
<p>This is what this is meant to be, this is my destiny,</p>
<p>this is why I did everything I did,</p>
<p>versus the ones that don&rsquo;t think about it ever,</p>
<p>but just kind of like hope, it&rsquo;s not real to them,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel attainable,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t committed to believing it was possible.</p>
<p>Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,</p>
<p>you probably worked with him on the details</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but he said that you should really</p>
<p>focus on visualizing the sensations you feel.</p>
<p>So say if you&rsquo;re drinking coffee or something like that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking about like observing yourself</p>
<p>from a third person perspective drinking coffee,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re thinking of how your hand will feel</p>
<p>when it touches something warm.</p>
<p>Like you try to replay the actual sensations</p>
<p>you would feel, right?</p>
<p>So it sounds kind of strange,</p>
<p>but meaning like you really wanna put yourself in the body</p>
<p>as you would experience those moments,</p>
<p>as opposed to like watching yourself on TV</p>
<p>experience in those moments, like really be inside.</p>
<p>And yeah, so that means sensations,</p>
<p>like how does it feel when you grip a gi?</p>
<p>How does it, yeah, the sweating,</p>
<p>just the sensation of sweat,</p>
<p>like rolling down your forehead or whatever,</p>
<p>like all of those actual feelings.</p>
<p>When I explain it to you,</p>
<p>like I guess my body has been through it so many times,</p>
<p>both in my mind and in reality</p>
<p>that it brings back all of those same emotions.</p>
<p>I start to get goosebumps, my armpits start to sweat,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m living it if it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reliving it now.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re going through the visualization process,</p>
<p>it has to be that real, the smells,</p>
<p>the taping of the fingers,</p>
<p>like the more colorful and the more real you can make it,</p>
<p>the more believable it is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been doing this kind of thing,</p>
<p>just having listened to you enough</p>
<p>for other stuff in life, so let&rsquo;s see if it works.</p>
<p>But do you see this kind of visualization</p>
<p>being useful for other things in career</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>100%, 100%, because I just know with my own life,</p>
<p>my own experiences, like my wife sometimes says to me,</p>
<p>she says, well, where do you see yourself</p>
<p>in like five years from now?</p>
<p>And five years ago, I had said to her,</p>
<p>I wanna have my own business.</p>
<p>I wanna have, this is the amount of money</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m hoping I can make in a given year.</p>
<p>Like you have to have goals for yourself.</p>
<p>Like is this, if you put out there like,</p>
<p>okay, I wanna make a million dollars in a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big number.</p>
<p>Like for me or for the normal person,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a really big number.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not, especially when you&rsquo;re not making</p>
<p>that much at the time, it&rsquo;s a super big number, right?</p>
<p>So having those goals for yourself,</p>
<p>like it won&rsquo;t happen and it&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>unless you dream it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and think that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And then it doesn&rsquo;t magically happen.</p>
<p>And maybe it doesn&rsquo;t happen in five years,</p>
<p>maybe it happens in 10,</p>
<p>but at least you&rsquo;re on the path to getting there.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I said, I wanna own my own business.</p>
<p>I wanna control my own destiny.</p>
<p>I wanna be my own boss.</p>
<p>I wanna make my own decisions.</p>
<p>Like these are the things that I told her I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m at that point,</p>
<p>where I work for myself,</p>
<p>I have my own company, I have partners obviously,</p>
<p>but like if I wanna pick up and go somewhere for a week,</p>
<p>I just do, I don&rsquo;t have to ask permission to do it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what life, freedom, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>And all of it starts with a dream.</p>
<p>In the same with my dojo, when I first opened.</p>
<p>So I ran a dojo for a long time</p>
<p>and I only had 60 students always,</p>
<p>like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.</p>
<p>And I sit there and say,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t I get more people in my door, right?</p>
<p>So I hired consultants to come in</p>
<p>and look at my business and say why, right?</p>
<p>And they came in and said,</p>
<p>well, this place is really intimidating.</p>
<p>Like if I was coming in off the street,</p>
<p>the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion</p>
<p>on the wall and I see this training that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and these guys are flying through the air and landing hard.</p>
<p>And as a white belt, you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the class for me?</p>
<p>Like no way, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So like I listened to these people and I said, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And the training was hour and a half, two hours long.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t handle an hour and a half or two hours training</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re first walking in the door.</p>
<p>So I had to restructure all my programming.</p>
<p>I had to look at the way I was offering my school</p>
<p>and I had to make levels for everybody, right?</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s my four to six year old class.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my six to 13 year old class.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all my beginner classes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t mix in with the advanced people.</p>
<p>And I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody</p>
<p>instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.</p>
<p>And then the challenge was, okay,</p>
<p>if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a recreational school.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t produce champions at that same school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was told.</p>
<p>So then I got all my black belts together</p>
<p>and I said, listen, this is my vision.</p>
<p>This is what I want.</p>
<p>I wanna have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes,</p>
<p>no jujitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.</p>
<p>I want over 200 people.</p>
<p>And in the inside of that dojo, I wanna have Olympic</p>
<p>champions and I wanna have recreational,</p>
<p>like little kids, five and six years old,</p>
<p>older guys in their seventies train, I don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>but I want the spectrum of recreational</p>
<p>and I want Olympic champions.</p>
<p>The only way to do that is to take your instructors</p>
<p>and say, you&rsquo;re gonna do this, define the roles,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be the recreational coach,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be the competitive coach.</p>
<p>How do we separate these programs?</p>
<p>And lo and behold, that was my vision that I shared</p>
<p>with all of them and that was back in 2006.</p>
<p>And by 2012, we&rsquo;ve got Olympic champion Kayla Harrison,</p>
<p>we have over 200 people at the school,</p>
<p>we have a successful thriving business,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen without that vision,</p>
<p>a plan and believing that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Believing that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I personally have on top of that</p>
<p>almost like very specific visions of a future.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t wanna give actual examples.</p>
<p>Cause for several reasons, one of which is just people</p>
<p>will, as they often have, they often will in your life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just laugh at it a little bit,</p>
<p>like that seems silly.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m very hesitant to share certain things</p>
<p>like that with people because they&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m with Johnny Ive, who&rsquo;s the lead designer</p>
<p>in Apple, like you want that dream, that little flame</p>
<p>to not, people will put that flame out too easily,</p>
<p>even people that love you.</p>
<p>So I have very specific kind of visions,</p>
<p>like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent</p>
<p>or something like Ole Bischoff, like very specific,</p>
<p>very specific situation of what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Not just like, I wanna be an Olympic champion,</p>
<p>but very specific, like almost silly situations.</p>
<p>Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis</p>
<p>and Ole Bischoff or something, like maybe visualize that.</p>
<p>For me, that helps because it makes it all real,</p>
<p>even more real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some big goal, like a million dollars</p>
<p>or something like that, which is also really important</p>
<p>to have because you can measure it and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like you belong in those situations.</p>
<p>Just believing you belong there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the default.</p>
<p>It can be you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be you.</p>
<p>And for some reason, that really helps me,</p>
<p>the little details.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Like visualizing, most of them are almost</p>
<p>a little bit funny, like focusing on the funniness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the mundaneness of it helps me a lot.</p>
<p>And all the people that have done great things,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just human too.</p>
<p>Correct, and I think a lot of people overestimate</p>
<p>who others are and sell themselves too short.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, everybody started</p>
<p>like everybody else, really.</p>
<p>I mean, we did.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all infants.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t walk, we couldn&rsquo;t talk,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>We learned along the way.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the one thing that I realized is that,</p>
<p>and I tell this to my athletes,</p>
<p>but I also tell it to my recreational students,</p>
<p>nobody is better than you are, nobody,</p>
<p>unless you allow them to be.</p>
<p>If you really want something to happen,</p>
<p>then like map the plan, believe in yourself,</p>
<p>decide, and know full out, you&rsquo;re gonna fail a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get beat down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have losses.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have struggles.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the one thing with social media today</p>
<p>is that everybody sees everybody succeed.</p>
<p>Nobody posts the picture when they&rsquo;re on the ground</p>
<p>and fail, you&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>Like nobody sees when you broke your arm</p>
<p>and you had to go through rehab,</p>
<p>whatever it is, like had your injuries</p>
<p>and you were on your couch watching TV</p>
<p>and you were suffering and you were like,</p>
<p>everybody has really, really dark, bad moments in their life</p>
<p>and defeats and losses and suffrage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only at the end after they&rsquo;ve recovered</p>
<p>from all of that, they&rsquo;ve reclimbed up the mountain</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gone to the pinnacle</p>
<p>that you see them on social media with the medal, right?</p>
<p>But everybody else like struggles and was human</p>
<p>and failed many, many times.</p>
<p>And convincing yourself that you&rsquo;re capable,</p>
<p>I think is the first start of everything.</p>
<p>Do you need people in your life that believe in you</p>
<p>or should most of it come from within yourself?</p>
<p>I think most of it has to come in from,</p>
<p>it certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.</p>
<p>You have to be driven, like other people can help you</p>
<p>define where you wanna go and help you get there</p>
<p>and encourage you and can support you</p>
<p>and whether it&rsquo;s resource wise or with connections</p>
<p>and like they can help with that path,</p>
<p>but that first part has to come from you.</p>
<p>It has to be your passion, your desire,</p>
<p>your commitment to yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s gonna ultimately make</p>
<p>all the sacrifices to do it.</p>
<p>So it has to be your decision, not your parents,</p>
<p>not your spouses, something that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really motivated to do.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,</p>
<p>and maybe a few of the other athletes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been involved with.</p>
<p>So first, Travis.</p>
<p>Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,</p>
<p>three time Olympian, 2008, 2012, 2016.</p>
<p>What makes Travis Stevens great?</p>
<p>What makes him so successful?</p>
<p>What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?</p>
<p>Through all the hardship he had to overcome,</p>
<p>through his weird looking sayonagi</p>
<p>that eventually worked out nicely,</p>
<p>through the full richness of his personality,</p>
<p>in the context of all the other great athletes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve coached, what makes him special?</p>
<p>His fight, Travis has fight.</p>
<p>And you know, the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens</p>
<p>was in, like recognized him, maybe I had seen him before</p>
<p>as a younger boy or something,</p>
<p>but like actually recognized him as,</p>
<p>I brought a group of young kids to Italy</p>
<p>for a competition in a training camp.</p>
<p>And it was this program called U23 Elite.</p>
<p>And I picked, handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.</p>
<p>And it was the first time I coached an international team.</p>
<p>And I had never seen Travis fight before,</p>
<p>compete, train, anything.</p>
<p>And during this competition, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an 81 kilo player.</p>
<p>I think he was maybe like 18 years old, 17, 18 years old.</p>
<p>And it was a really hard European event.</p>
<p>And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.</p>
<p>But what stood out the most to me was like,</p>
<p>the fight he had in him.</p>
<p>He was scrapping every fight.</p>
<p>Like he scrapped hard.</p>
<p>Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t win, but he wanted to win more.</p>
<p>And I noticed that right away.</p>
<p>And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match</p>
<p>and he was eliminated from the tournament,</p>
<p>I saw how disappointed he was in himself.</p>
<p>Like he actually thought he was supposed</p>
<p>to beat those people.</p>
<p>Even though he was like 17, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s fighting against grown men that are,</p>
<p>you know, a high level judo, much higher than he was.</p>
<p>And I said to him, I said,</p>
<p>hey son, like, don&rsquo;t worry, man.</p>
<p>You got a long career ahead of you.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re disappointed,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many things you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and so many skills you don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>The fact that you were able to hold your own</p>
<p>and scrap like that, like you&rsquo;ve got a good future.</p>
<p>And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,</p>
<p>after that tournament.</p>
<p>And I said, hey man,</p>
<p>did you ever hear of this kid, Travis Stevens?</p>
<p>He says, no, why?</p>
<p>I said, man, that kid&rsquo;s got some fight in him, right?</p>
<p>And I said that, I said that to Jason at the time.</p>
<p>I said, that kid&rsquo;s got some fight in him, man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty talented, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it started.</p>
<p>But so I saw that in him when he was young.</p>
<p>But the other thing was, Travis,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s no such thing as hard work to that guy.</p>
<p>If you tell him to put his head through the wall</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how he wins,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go put his head through the wall.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.</p>
<p>And he hates failure more than he likes winning, 100%.</p>
<p>He always has.</p>
<p>He punishes himself when he doesn&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>He makes himself work harder.</p>
<p>He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn&rsquo;t succeed</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a trait that I think all of the athletes</p>
<p>that I work with closely, they all had that same trait.</p>
<p>They hated losing more than anything.</p>
<p>They would break their arm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d fall on their head.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament.</p>
<p>And as a result, then they all had fight</p>
<p>and they all were willing to train.</p>
<p>They were willing to listen.</p>
<p>They would do anything for victory.</p>
<p>Within the rules, I&rsquo;m not talking about taking drugs</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;d give 100% of themselves for victory.</p>
<p>And Travis was somebody that when he was down,</p>
<p>he found a way to get better doing something else.</p>
<p>If he couldn&rsquo;t do standing, that&rsquo;s when he started jujitsu.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t go on his feet anymore.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t stand up and train.</p>
<p>Might as well go learn jujitsu</p>
<p>and get good on the ground because I can.</p>
<p>So he always found a way no matter what obstacle</p>
<p>was in his way, he just went around it.</p>
<p>So what about, it&rsquo;d be interesting to get your perspective</p>
<p>because I know Travis&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>is just the number of injuries.</p>
<p>Like what do you make of the perseverance</p>
<p>through all the injuries he had to overcome?</p>
<p>Specifically like you just observing this creature</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve coached.</p>
<p>I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem.</p>
<p>He just like, just like you said, head through the wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what, like when we were talking about injuries,</p>
<p>he kinda, he doesn&rsquo;t even see the injuries themselves</p>
<p>as the problem because he thinks that the injuries,</p>
<p>you know, you heal back stronger.</p>
<p>I forget the exact quote, but he said like,</p>
<p>my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve already broken everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken everything and it&rsquo;s just grown back stronger.</p>
<p>Like, cause I asked him something like,</p>
<p>do you regret sort of pushing your body</p>
<p>to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?</p>
<p>He was, his response was like, no, I&rsquo;m stronger now.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s justification,</p>
<p>but that certainly describes a mindset that,</p>
<p>yeah, head through the wall.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s almost not dramatic.</p>
<p>Like, look, I got this injury.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, I&rsquo;m so like brave and special</p>
<p>for overcoming this injury.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s part of the job</p>
<p>and he gets the job done.</p>
<p>But like that job involves a lot of injuries.</p>
<p>One of the talks I gave Travis and that team</p>
<p>at that particular tournament was at the very beginning</p>
<p>of the camp after the tournament, I said to them, listen,</p>
<p>my vision, I shared my vision with them.</p>
<p>I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years,</p>
<p>cause that was 2005, I said in seven years,</p>
<p>I wanna have a US team that steps on the mat</p>
<p>that is ready to kick ass.</p>
<p>And in order to get there,</p>
<p>all of you guys can be a part of this team</p>
<p>and part of this process.</p>
<p>But in order to get there,</p>
<p>you guys have to be the first ones to practice.</p>
<p>You have to be the last ones to leave</p>
<p>cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re up against all odds.</p>
<p>I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock of judo</p>
<p>and being the first round, easy match,</p>
<p>warmup for everybody else.</p>
<p>I said, if you get injured,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be on the side with, you know,</p>
<p>with a ice bag on taking off rounds.</p>
<p>And then get back on the mat the next day</p>
<p>and tell me you&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>If you can train the next day, you can train today.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no injury.</p>
<p>The only time you&rsquo;ll leave in this dojo</p>
<p>is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.</p>
<p>You know, and I do think subliminally,</p>
<p>Travis bought into that message and heard that message then,</p>
<p>said, if I&rsquo;m gonna be a champion,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>And he did, and he embodied it, he lived it.</p>
<p>Man, do it many times in Europe where I said,</p>
<p>dude, just tape it up, go off to the side,</p>
<p>just take the day off, like, take the rest of the day off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re beat up, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>He said, no, no, I&rsquo;m gonna tape it up, I&rsquo;m gonna tape it up.</p>
<p>I said, no, you don&rsquo;t need to right now.</p>
<p>And he said, no, sensei, I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>You know, the ambulance isn&rsquo;t taking me out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just my wrist, it&rsquo;s just my ankle, it&rsquo;s just my wrist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my ankle, yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about the, so the other really big thing</p>
<p>is you comment on a little bit is the weight cut.</p>
<p>So early in his career, he was 81 kg,</p>
<p>and that was presumably not so difficult.</p>
<p>But later in his career, he is 81 kg,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s becoming more and more difficult.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other thing with him is,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve known a lot of really, really tough people</p>
<p>at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.</p>
<p>Like that can break the toughest minds.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have broken him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s delivered on it often, on like insane weight cuts.</p>
<p>So just as a coach, what do you think about his,</p>
<p>particularly his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?</p>
<p>It was part of his process.</p>
<p>It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.</p>
<p>Suffering?</p>
<p>Yeah, it really was.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m gonna suffer this much,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna make my opponents pay</p>
<p>for all the suffering that I went through to get here.</p>
<p>That was his mindset.</p>
<p>Later on in his career, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>like a lot of times, Travis,</p>
<p>he would never step on a scale</p>
<p>until he got to the tournament.</p>
<p>And even when he get to the tournament,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;d weigh like 90 kilos.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d show up at the tournament nine kilos over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you have to, but I never,</p>
<p>it was just an expectation of making weight.</p>
<p>Not making weight was never an option</p>
<p>for any of our athletes.</p>
<p>And Travis knew it.</p>
<p>And he said, as a professional, my job is to make weight.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t make weight,</p>
<p>he was never gonna allow that to happen.</p>
<p>And he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say,</p>
<p>hey, I told you.</p>
<p>Cause losing wasn&rsquo;t an option,</p>
<p>making weight wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>not making weight was not an option for him ever either.</p>
<p>But a lot of times he wouldn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be nine kilos over on the plane</p>
<p>going over to the tournament</p>
<p>and have to make weight three days later.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t break 86 kilos</p>
<p>until the day before the tournament.</p>
<p>Like he had five kilos over the day before.</p>
<p>That was his way.</p>
<p>But he would do three workouts</p>
<p>to wake up in the morning and work out.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;d eat.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;d work out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;d eat again.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;d work out again at night.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;d reward himself.</p>
<p>Hey, I worked out three times today.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d go have a, you know, a Mountain Dew.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, or a chocolate bar.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And then his next morning, he&rsquo;s back up to 87</p>
<p>and he would never touch weight</p>
<p>until the morning of weigh ins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, when he,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t on weight for more than like five minutes.</p>
<p>His process would break a lot of people.</p>
<p>So the fact that he got the job done is&hellip;</p>
<p>Not just the job done, but every single time</p>
<p>he got the job done.</p>
<p>And I made those athletes fight.</p>
<p>We would fight in Paris.</p>
<p>We would do a camp for a week,</p>
<p>double session camp for a week.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be seven kilos over,</p>
<p>have to fight the next weekend.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking two or three days later.</p>
<p>You know, so not only did he make the weight,</p>
<p>but he did a grueling training camp twice a day.</p>
<p>And then cut weight and then fought again.</p>
<p>Then did another camp for a week</p>
<p>in double session training camp,</p>
<p>and then fought on a third weekend in a row.</p>
<p>And our athletes went through hell.</p>
<p>You know, all of our athletes went through hell</p>
<p>because on the tour around the world,</p>
<p>they fought in every event.</p>
<p>They did every camp.</p>
<p>They fought in every event.</p>
<p>Whereas most of the other teams,</p>
<p>like Japan comes in and fights in Paris,</p>
<p>then they go home.</p>
<p>You know, they maybe do a camp for three days,</p>
<p>then they go home.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight</p>
<p>and fight in every tournament.</p>
<p>And when you get to Germany,</p>
<p>the Germans skip the French Open.</p>
<p>They skip the camp in France.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just getting ready for Germany.</p>
<p>Our athletes already had two competitions,</p>
<p>two training camps, three weight cuts now.</p>
<p>And then, so they&rsquo;re not 100% when they fight in Germany,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all part of the experience they need,</p>
<p>the training that they need</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t get here in this country.</p>
<p>And all of those were just preparation</p>
<p>for our world championships or our Olympic games.</p>
<p>So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,</p>
<p>they felt so strong, so rested, so like,</p>
<p>man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany</p>
<p>feels like nothing today</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re fully rested now, you know?</p>
<p>But part of the challenge</p>
<p>is because the American team is smaller and more,</p>
<p>I mean, just smaller,</p>
<p>is all the different places you go to do the weight cut,</p>
<p>to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, like that process changes every time.</p>
<p>So you basically have to improvise a lot.</p>
<p>So you show up to a hotel</p>
<p>and how you do the weight cut, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And this is the different weather conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like, what is it?</p>
<p>Rocky versus Drago, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have, you have to just improvise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also a fascinating part</p>
<p>of the American judo story,</p>
<p>which is like, you have to improvise more.</p>
<p>Well, it was funny because when I, it was 1990,</p>
<p>and it was at the Goodwill Games, right?</p>
<p>And we were, it was a US Olympic committee type event.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re on the bus with the swim team.</p>
<p>And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to the judo competition,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re on the bus with the swim team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, we&rsquo;re going to the venue where we&rsquo;re staying.</p>
<p>You know, I remember being like by ourselves</p>
<p>with no staff, no manager, no coach,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just by ourselves going to fight in Russia, right?</p>
<p>And the swim team&rsquo;s on there with their full sweats</p>
<p>and their staff and like their managers.</p>
<p>And I heard the lady, the girl go,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, this was 1994,</p>
<p>because it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>So I heard the little girl on the team,</p>
<p>she goes up to the coach, she goes,</p>
<p>coach, do you think you can send the massage therapist</p>
<p>to my room at 10 a.m.?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m feeling kind of jet lag.</p>
<p>I looked at, me and Jason looked at each other like,</p>
<p>oh, she&rsquo;s scheduling a massage?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have a staff.</p>
<p>Like what the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>You know, what a difference in sporting,</p>
<p>you know, different sports within the same country,</p>
<p>you know, and.</p>
<p>But that, I mean, not to romanticize things,</p>
<p>but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re kind of the improvisational nature of it.</p>
<p>Cause it is just you, you and sometimes you and the coach</p>
<p>and just pure guts and you against the world with no money.</p>
<p>The warrior spirit.</p>
<p>How did it feel like when he,</p>
<p>after being in two Olympics,</p>
<p>beating some of the best people in the world,</p>
<p>facing some of the best people in the world</p>
<p>and just barely losing,</p>
<p>what did it feel like to you as a coach</p>
<p>to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?</p>
<p>Electric.</p>
<p>I like, first of all, in 2012 in London,</p>
<p>it was like, it felt like somebody died.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be, I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>The Ole Bischoff match?</p>
<p>Not, no, just seeing Travis not finish on the podium period.</p>
<p>You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,</p>
<p>I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.</p>
<p>He just left everything he had on that mat, right?</p>
<p>10 minutes of probably it was a 20 something minute match,</p>
<p>but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?</p>
<p>He left everything he had.</p>
<p>He wanted to be in the Olympic finals.</p>
<p>He wanted to be Olympic champion.</p>
<p>And when he didn&rsquo;t get that opportunity,</p>
<p>he lost everything.</p>
<p>He drained himself.</p>
<p>He cried for 45 minutes straight.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t regroup him.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get him up.</p>
<p>I said, Travis, you&rsquo;ve got to stop your crying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get off the floor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a bronze medal fight.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t recover, you&rsquo;re not going to perform well.</p>
<p>And he just didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like it was gold or nothing.</p>
<p>And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,</p>
<p>he had beaten the Canadian.</p>
<p>I think at that time,</p>
<p>he had beaten that Canadian every single time,</p>
<p>except for that bronze medal match.</p>
<p>But he just didn&rsquo;t have the fight in him anymore.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;d left it all in the match,</p>
<p>in the Bischoff match.</p>
<p>So to see him come back with zero, right?</p>
<p>We just had a team where his best friend, Marty Malloy,</p>
<p>won a bronze medal, right?</p>
<p>Then the day after Travis fights,</p>
<p>Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal, right?</p>
<p>Our first ever gold.</p>
<p>So we have a gold and a bronze.</p>
<p>His training partner wins a gold.</p>
<p>His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.</p>
<p>He has nothing, right?</p>
<p>To see him for four years go through hell,</p>
<p>like literally like all of his injuries,</p>
<p>every training camp,</p>
<p>and then forget the humiliation,</p>
<p>because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,</p>
<p>they want to talk to Kayla.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the Olympic champion.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s this Travis guy?</p>
<p>Who is this guy?</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t medal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not that important.</p>
<p>And up until you get to right before the Olympics,</p>
<p>now they talk about he&rsquo;s an Olympian again.</p>
<p>But up until that point,</p>
<p>and then every little kid sees Kayla&rsquo;s medal.</p>
<p>Oh, Travis, yeah, you went to the Olympics.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your medal?</p>
<p>How did you do?</p>
<p>You know, I took fifth, I didn&rsquo;t place.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the lowest of low,</p>
<p>every day having that constant reminder.</p>
<p>So four years later, when that guy,</p>
<p>I mean, mentally, he was ready.</p>
<p>Physically, he was ready.</p>
<p>That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I&rsquo;ve ever felt.</p>
<p>Like, cause I had to get on the mat</p>
<p>and do some drills and stuff like that,</p>
<p>and like try to defend armbars,</p>
<p>and cause we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of bodies in Rio.</p>
<p>And I was like, my God, he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I said after one of the prizes,</p>
<p>those are the strongest I&rsquo;ve ever felt that guy, right?</p>
<p>Before the competition, so physically he was ready.</p>
<p>Mentally, the morning of competition,</p>
<p>I said to Travis, I looked him in the eye,</p>
<p>and I said, you know, we&rsquo;re ready to go over to the venue.</p>
<p>I said, are you ready today?</p>
<p>And he just looked at me like he goes,</p>
<p>I am gonna shock the world today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he told me, I&rsquo;m gonna shock the world today.</p>
<p>And I said, all right, great, let&rsquo;s go, right?</p>
<p>So we go to the venue,</p>
<p>and every other athlete was just like nervously,</p>
<p>like doing repetitions of Uchi Komis.</p>
<p>You could see like sweat coming out.</p>
<p>You could see like all this nervous energy</p>
<p>going through their body.</p>
<p>And here comes Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got these big goofy headphones on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a tank top that says USA on it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the swim trunks that say USA,</p>
<p>like that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall</p>
<p>where all these athletes are warming up</p>
<p>for their first match.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like dancing around, like doing this loose warmup,</p>
<p>like almost like a little kid at an amusement park</p>
<p>whose dad said, yeah, go play, you know?</p>
<p>And it was like, he had waited four years for that moment,</p>
<p>and he was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed,</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>It was like a caged tiger.</p>
<p>Like if you like coming out of the chute</p>
<p>to go step on to the mat was like this tiger</p>
<p>that you were just letting out of the cage,</p>
<p>and he just go, like now&rsquo;s your time to go fight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he did that whole day.</p>
<p>And like when he beat Chirikishvili in the semis</p>
<p>and choked him out and won that fight,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s nobody with the exception</p>
<p>of maybe the guys in the American team,</p>
<p>there was nobody in that stadium</p>
<p>that expected Travis to beat him, nobody.</p>
<p>Like, you know, he had smashed Travis,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times before that free poem,</p>
<p>like in the first minute even.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a fight, right?</p>
<p>And it was great game plan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the world number one at the time too.</p>
<p>World number one at the time, world champion,</p>
<p>carried the flag for the Georgian Federation</p>
<p>walking into the games,</p>
<p>most dominant 81 kilo player in that weight class</p>
<p>for quite some time.</p>
<p>And man, we just had his number and Travis was ready to go.</p>
<p>It was so cool.</p>
<p>It was so awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, we had already won,</p>
<p>Kayla had already won her second gold, right?</p>
<p>The way the event went and Travis winning that</p>
<p>was like icing on the cake for our team.</p>
<p>That was the best performance we&rsquo;ve ever had in history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Kayla.</p>
<p>She is one of, if not the greatest American Jidoka ever.</p>
<p>Two time gold medalist.</p>
<p>2010 world champion.</p>
<p>2010.</p>
<p>First senior worlds.</p>
<p>Senior worlds.</p>
<p>What makes Kayla special?</p>
<p>What makes her so great?</p>
<p>What made this champion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of a lot of things.</p>
<p>One was obviously Kayla&rsquo;s mental toughness, right?</p>
<p>To overcome what she overcame.</p>
<p>You know, this is a girl who,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s not say forget about the sexual abuse,</p>
<p>but the fact that she had to go through that in life</p>
<p>and learned how to compartmentalize that</p>
<p>and keep that off as a separate part of her brain,</p>
<p>you know, and forget about it and move on.</p>
<p>That took an incredible team to help her do that,</p>
<p>and my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, we should comment</p>
<p>and say that Kayla had to go through trauma</p>
<p>in her earlier life through sexual abuse</p>
<p>and had to overcome that through the whole process</p>
<p>of becoming a champion as well.</p>
<p>Because she had zero self esteem, zero self worth.</p>
<p>She was at the lowest of lows</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t even want to be on this earth, right?</p>
<p>So she was traumatized obviously</p>
<p>and getting her the right help</p>
<p>and surrounding her with the right people</p>
<p>who could help her get through that</p>
<p>and be by her side as she&rsquo;s getting through that</p>
<p>and letting her know and reaffirming</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s doing the right thing</p>
<p>and she made the right decision</p>
<p>and she should have zero guilt.</p>
<p>And you know, this doesn&rsquo;t define her.</p>
<p>It happened to her, but it doesn&rsquo;t define her.</p>
<p>What defines her is what she does from now on.</p>
<p>And then rebuilding that person to become who she became.</p>
<p>I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.</p>
<p>But then as an athlete, she&rsquo;s a lot like Travis.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a warrior.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fighter.</p>
<p>My dad always jokes with her.</p>
<p>He says, you&rsquo;re a workhorse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a thoroughbred.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna treat you like a thoroughbred, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a workhorse, so you&rsquo;re gonna work.</p>
<p>And the way you&rsquo;re gonna get bigger and stronger</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re gonna work harder and you&rsquo;re gonna keep, you know.</p>
<p>And she came to us when she was only 15.</p>
<p>So at that time we got her</p>
<p>with a really good strength and conditioning coach.</p>
<p>We did all the core Olympic style lifting.</p>
<p>Like as her body was developing,</p>
<p>she was getting stronger every single day.</p>
<p>And then, you know, she had the luxury</p>
<p>of being on the mat with,</p>
<p>at the time I was still young enough to train</p>
<p>and be on the mat and I was around her weight class</p>
<p>and Travis was able to train with her</p>
<p>and we had all the top US athletes at the time</p>
<p>training here at my school.</p>
<p>So she got the benefit of all the best guys</p>
<p>to train within the country, you know.</p>
<p>And her doing all of those rounds,</p>
<p>you know, night in, week, night,</p>
<p>every night, every week, every year,</p>
<p>compiled with the best, you know,</p>
<p>highest level she could as a girl.</p>
<p>She got the strength, she got the technique,</p>
<p>she got the, and then she had the coaching on top of it</p>
<p>with my dad being on her as, you know,</p>
<p>working her out and, you know, having the wherewithal</p>
<p>to develop a strategy and a plan for her.</p>
<p>Because when she first came here,</p>
<p>she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.</p>
<p>At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here</p>
<p>and she was 70 kilos.</p>
<p>So if Kayla was struggling making 63,</p>
<p>so the only way to, obviously,</p>
<p>the only way to still compete is to move up.</p>
<p>But my dad said, well, if you move up,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in Rhonda&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s skip that weight and you&rsquo;re gonna go to 78 kilos.</p>
<p>And he told her, listen, you&rsquo;re gonna go up two weight classes.</p>
<p>She looked at him and was like, that&rsquo;s 172 pounds.</p>
<p>And he goes, well, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re already struggling making 138,</p>
<p>you weigh 150, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>We put 20 pounds on, go to 170.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why she jumped two weights,</p>
<p>because she passed Rhonda, she went to the weight above</p>
<p>so she could make the national team</p>
<p>and she had a chance to go to the Olympics</p>
<p>and all that, because we envisioned Rhonda</p>
<p>staying around till 2012.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also like a longterm vision</p>
<p>because you kind of grow into that body then over time.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So you can dominate, you can learn</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like in that weight class.</p>
<p>You can learn to dominate that weight class,</p>
<p>excel and then dominate.</p>
<p>People that cut weight too hard, too long,</p>
<p>they forget about technique</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re only worried about losing weight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always tired in training.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give 100% effort, they&rsquo;re not getting better.</p>
<p>She now is just focused on getting better at judo,</p>
<p>getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful.</p>
<p>So I think giving her that purpose and that,</p>
<p>that was a great call.</p>
<p>What are some memorable or maybe the most memorable moment,</p>
<p>Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?</p>
<p>Not the most perhaps, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>what are some memorable moments?</p>
<p>Everybody hears the good ones, right?</p>
<p>So everybody knows she won the world championships</p>
<p>in Tokyo in 2010.</p>
<p>She was our two time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget those moments, right?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re historic.</p>
<p>One of the biggest moments that I liked sharing this story</p>
<p>with everybody is that in 2010 in January,</p>
<p>Kayla was still a developing athlete</p>
<p>and we had a local tournament in New York.</p>
<p>It was in Brooklyn, New York, it was called the Starrett Cup.</p>
<p>And I knew that at that tournament</p>
<p>that two of the Canadian girls,</p>
<p>they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t superstars, but they were tough players.</p>
<p>Both of them, I knew were gonna be at that tournament.</p>
<p>So I said, Kayla, we&rsquo;re gonna go to this tournament,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna compete against the Canadian girls,</p>
<p>get some good experience,</p>
<p>figure out what you need to work on</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go home and work on some stuff.</p>
<p>Well, she went to the tournament,</p>
<p>there was only three girls in the weight,</p>
<p>her and the two Canadians.</p>
<p>At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?</p>
<p>So this is January, 2010, she lost both matches.</p>
<p>She was competitive,</p>
<p>but certainly things she needed to work on,</p>
<p>it was good development thing for her and for us.</p>
<p>It also opened her mind to say, oh man,</p>
<p>cause she was already a junior world champion at the time.</p>
<p>But so now there&rsquo;s another level,</p>
<p>this is a senior level, right?</p>
<p>You gotta go up another level.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s two girls that aren&rsquo;t even medalists</p>
<p>that are beating you.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s more work to be done.</p>
<p>And so I like telling that story</p>
<p>because everybody sees the champions in the greatest moments,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see them when they have bad days.</p>
<p>And could you imagine being, oh and two,</p>
<p>you feel like a failure, right?</p>
<p>But 10 months later, it was Tokyo 2010,</p>
<p>she went from oh and two at Starret, New York</p>
<p>to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an amazing turnaround.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s only possible if you put the losses</p>
<p>in their proper context,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t let it destroy you mentally</p>
<p>and just keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>This is so funny.</p>
<p>So you were there 2010 at the Starret Cup?</p>
<p>Was Travis there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I made all those, we fought at every,</p>
<p>like the mentality of our team was</p>
<p>no tournament is beneath us.</p>
<p>If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no tournament that&rsquo;s beneath us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get experience, we&rsquo;re gonna fight,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna learn, we&rsquo;re gonna compete,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get better, you know?</p>
<p>I actually, just as a funny little side,</p>
<p>I was there, I competed.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>This is one of the earlier tournaments,</p>
<p>like the beginner division.</p>
<p>Oh no, I actually did black belt division too.</p>
<p>That was one of the, actually yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it was so early that I thought,</p>
<p>like I was also really strong at that time,</p>
<p>just like physically like power lifting stuff.</p>
<p>So I thought like it&rsquo;ll be good experience</p>
<p>to also do black belt division.</p>
<p>And remember, it must have been actually</p>
<p>Travis&rsquo;s division, which is funny.</p>
<p>Is Legere Brothers?</p>
<p>Yeah, Harry and Gary.</p>
<p>They are super, they&rsquo;re super good</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re super dominant,</p>
<p>but I think Travis faced one of them and beat them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just remembered,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny how there&rsquo;s just like these little roads</p>
<p>that later reconnect.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s some incredible people there.</p>
<p>And I saw obviously the positive things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting that Kayla&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>was also intersecting there</p>
<p>and that was one of the lower points for her.</p>
<p>Another story I like to share is that</p>
<p>you have to know your athletes, right?</p>
<p>And you have to really get to know their,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re thinking psychologically, mentally,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going through their head.</p>
<p>Another story was in Tokyo.</p>
<p>It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.</p>
<p>So we had had Kayla face off</p>
<p>against almost all the top girls in her division.</p>
<p>She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam,</p>
<p>there was a girl from Japan</p>
<p>that she hadn&rsquo;t fought in a long time</p>
<p>and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.</p>
<p>So it was something we wanted her</p>
<p>to beat this girl going into the Olympics</p>
<p>so that she knew she could beat everybody.</p>
<p>And it was a first round match</p>
<p>and it was gonna be tough for Kayla, right?</p>
<p>It was gonna be a really hard fight.</p>
<p>And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row</p>
<p>leading up to that.</p>
<p>So her confidence was really high, but at the same time,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t think she needed this fight.</p>
<p>And she showed up to the tournament and she said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can fight today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a stinger in my neck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a stinger coming down my neck and I&rsquo;m kind of sore.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t tell us.</p>
<p>She went and told the trainer.</p>
<p>She walked around, she&rsquo;s holding her neck.</p>
<p>And me and my dad were like, what&rsquo;s up with her?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then, so maybe she doesn&rsquo;t wanna fight today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t come to us.</p>
<p>The trainer came to us and says,</p>
<p>you know, I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>that Kayla fight today.</p>
<p>And we looked at him and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, your opinion doesn&rsquo;t really matter, does it?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, she has this thing in her neck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a pinched nerve and there&rsquo;s this and that.</p>
<p>We talked, I said, is there a risk of her getting injured?</p>
<p>Like, is this pain or is this risk</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s gonna get injured and she&rsquo;s gonna set her back</p>
<p>like long time in her career?</p>
<p>Says, no, she&rsquo;s not gonna get injured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pinched nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little pain she&rsquo;s gonna have to deal with.</p>
<p>I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?</p>
<p>Says, yeah, I can do this and that</p>
<p>and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away.</p>
<p>I said, okay, then do that.</p>
<p>And so Kayla comes up, she goes,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t the trainer talk to you?</p>
<p>I said, yeah, he talked to us.</p>
<p>Well, he said, I can&rsquo;t fight.</p>
<p>I know, but we already talked to the trainer and.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>He said, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>She looked at us like.</p>
<p>And then we had to talk to her and say, listen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not injured, you&rsquo;re in pain</p>
<p>because we just came from a camp.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re in pain, but here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>We want you to fight this girl.</p>
<p>We want you to go out there and beat this girl, period.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I want to know that you can beat this girl.</p>
<p>This is why we came.</p>
<p>This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic games.</p>
<p>This is what we want from you.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, she understood.</p>
<p>They gave her a quick shot.</p>
<p>The rest of the world thought we were crazy</p>
<p>making her compete.</p>
<p>And then she went out there, she fought,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know she was injured.</p>
<p>No, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>She just went out there, she fought the tournament.</p>
<p>She beat the Japanese girl.</p>
<p>She ended up going through the whole tournament.</p>
<p>She took a gold medal.</p>
<p>She won the event.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a great confidence builder, yeah.</p>
<p>And that kind of sets you up for all the chaos</p>
<p>that can happen at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>And it tells you if you can beat these girls</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not 100% and you&rsquo;re not at your best,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re physically beat, mentally beat,</p>
<p>imagine what you&rsquo;re gonna do when you&rsquo;re fresh.</p>
<p>Well, when she was going to the Olympic games,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>She had the mental game down.</p>
<p>Down.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a girl in that division</p>
<p>that thought they could beat Kayla</p>
<p>going into those games.</p>
<p>Not a one.</p>
<p>They just looked at her and went, no, not happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s a great Olympic champion,</p>
<p>two time Olympic champion.</p>
<p>But there is something that she&rsquo;s commented on,</p>
<p>which is she&rsquo;s suffered or went through depression</p>
<p>after winning her second Olympic gold.</p>
<p>Why do you think this happens?</p>
<p>You often hear stories of great champions</p>
<p>becoming depressed after the Olympics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of purpose afterwards, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve done in life what you set out to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a goal every day you woke up.</p>
<p>You knew what your purpose was.</p>
<p>You knew what your day looked like.</p>
<p>You knew why you were doing that.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re all happy.</p>
<p>But then you wake up and you go, now what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a next.</p>
<p>And also because there was nothing for her,</p>
<p>there was no path set out for Kayla that said,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re gonna become an ambassador,</p>
<p>a global ambassador of judo.</p>
<p>The IJF is gonna help pay a salary.</p>
<p>The USA judo is gonna give you a salary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we want you to go teach children.</p>
<p>We want you to go be an ambassador for women.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna fly you around and whatever it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna give you a job and here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to take it.</p>
<p>There was nothing for her.</p>
<p>Like I remember doing the interview at the Olympics</p>
<p>with her and they said, are you gonna compete</p>
<p>in the next Olympics?</p>
<p>And I said, no.</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>She already two time gold medalist.</p>
<p>What does three time gold medalist do for her?</p>
<p>Nothing, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t motivate her to do it again.</p>
<p>They said, are you doing MMA?</p>
<p>I said, no, why would she do MMA?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like she doesn&rsquo;t need MMA.</p>
<p>She should be able to make a living off of what she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accomplished in this sport for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>But what happens is, and what most people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is once you say I&rsquo;m retired, I&rsquo;m no longer competing</p>
<p>in the sport of judo, you don&rsquo;t get a salary</p>
<p>from USA Judo anymore, which she was getting.</p>
<p>I think she got like $72,000 a year</p>
<p>from USA Judo at the time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a stipend from the Olympic committee anymore.</p>
<p>Goes away.</p>
<p>Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club</p>
<p>was a great sponsor for her for all those years.</p>
<p>In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became</p>
<p>without the support of the NYC.</p>
<p>Cause I talked to them when she was 15, I said,</p>
<p>hey, I got a girl that&rsquo;s really good someday.</p>
<p>Like if you invest in her now,</p>
<p>I promise you she&rsquo;ll pay back for you.</p>
<p>And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold,</p>
<p>I called the guy up, I said, hey, I told you so.</p>
<p>But they can no longer give you stipends</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not competing and representing them anymore.</p>
<p>So that goes away.</p>
<p>All of your sponsorships and all of your money</p>
<p>that you would make from your TV commercials or whatever,</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t happen for her after the Olympics</p>
<p>cause Judo&rsquo;s a obscure sport, right?</p>
<p>So she didn&rsquo;t have any opportunities for that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.</p>
<p>How do you live?</p>
<p>You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee</p>
<p>or whatever for winning a gold.</p>
<p>But aside from that, you&rsquo;re not gonna live on that money.</p>
<p>So no purpose, no goal, right?</p>
<p>What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, so she has no direction.</p>
<p>And then at the same time, she has no money coming in.</p>
<p>So everything shuts off.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s like, wait till you turn, what do you do?</p>
<p>And that leads to being depressed because yeah,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve accomplished all this stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of lost in life.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s next for me?</p>
<p>And I guess you just have to ride that out</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re a great human being, great champion,</p>
<p>life has a way of helping you find a way.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s in mixed martial arts now,</p>
<p>but she has a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>Right, well, her kids, she adopted her sister&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s their legal guardian now.</p>
<p>So that is her purpose, right?</p>
<p>Raising these kids and making them part of her family.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s fortunate enough that she has enough money</p>
<p>that she can do that and she can give them a good life.</p>
<p>Mm hmm, I&rsquo;m gonna ask you to start some trouble.</p>
<p>But I heard that she said somewhere</p>
<p>that she can be Khabib Nurmagomedov in judo.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what level of judoka.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what level he is.</p>
<p>But I do know that that Russian system</p>
<p>respects judo immensely.</p>
<p>What I will tell you is this, I trained with Kayla</p>
<p>and I was an Olympic medalist and a world champion in judo.</p>
<p>And granted, I was older when I trained with her.</p>
<p>But you have to go as a man.</p>
<p>You have to go 100% or she will smash you as a man.</p>
<p>And I could tell you that if Khabib</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of just judo, doesn&rsquo;t like gripping</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t understand, if he can throw, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>But if he doesn&rsquo;t really understand judo at a high level,</p>
<p>she will throw him.</p>
<p>She would beat him in a match, in a judo contest.</p>
<p>Not in a mixed martial arts contest,</p>
<p>not in a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest.</p>
<p>In a pure judo match.</p>
<p>Where he cannot grab legs and he has to grip up</p>
<p>and just throw.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put my money on Kayla.</p>
<p>Unless he&rsquo;s, you know, if he could go place</p>
<p>in the nationals in Russia, he would beat her.</p>
<p>But if he&rsquo;s not at that level of judo,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s more like a brown belt or he&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a high level judo player, she will win.</p>
<p>I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country.</p>
<p>Some of the guys that went and won our,</p>
<p>medaled in our senior nationals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen her smash all of them in judo.</p>
<p>Now, she&rsquo;s not gonna do that to a Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not gonna do that to a senior national champion</p>
<p>or an Olympian in our sport.</p>
<p>But she will go toe to toe with every other male,</p>
<p>black belts or not.</p>
<p>Speaking of Khabib in Russia,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin, I don&rsquo;t know if you have heard of him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the president of Russia, but he&rsquo;s also a judoka.</p>
<p>Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?</p>
<p>What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually really good friends</p>
<p>with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>The guy in charge is Ezio Gamba.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an Italian, he&rsquo;s a mastermind behind their success</p>
<p>of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.</p>
<p>2020, he suffered from leukemia, blood cancer,</p>
<p>so he wasn&rsquo;t part of their 2020 program.</p>
<p>But he was part of 2012, 2016.</p>
<p>That whole national, the Olympic team in 2012</p>
<p>came to our studio and lived here for a month in Boston.</p>
<p>They went to school in Boston.</p>
<p>I brought them to my house.</p>
<p>They had three Olympic champions.</p>
<p>Three Olympic champions.</p>
<p>Oh my God, what a team.</p>
<p>They all came and lived here in Boston for a month.</p>
<p>They wanted to be part of experience America type program.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen all of them with Putin in Russia</p>
<p>at their national training center,</p>
<p>working out with them and taking falls</p>
<p>and doing judo with him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard when you&rsquo;re older to move in judo.</p>
<p>I mean, I was at a high level and I&rsquo;m now 51.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to move like I used to.</p>
<p>So at his age, he&rsquo;s gotta be what, 60,</p>
<p>between 62, 65ish?</p>
<p>I mean, it moves really well for somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that age and probably hasn&rsquo;t done very much judo</p>
<p>for the last however many years, right?</p>
<p>So that tells you he, at one point,</p>
<p>he had to be a really good judo player.</p>
<p>Yeah, he put in a lot of work at some point</p>
<p>to develop the technique.</p>
<p>You could tell when a great judo player,</p>
<p>even if they haven&rsquo;t practiced it,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re up there in age,</p>
<p>like just the way they move,</p>
<p>the way they go in for a Seinage,</p>
<p>the way they go for a particular throw,</p>
<p>the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>you could just tell he&rsquo;s good at judo.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating to see political leaders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to interact with quite a few</p>
<p>for whom judo was a formative experience in their life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so interesting that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>judo played a big part in their life, early development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to like if you served in the military.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something about judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, as a martial art, it&rsquo;s not just the technique.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s something about gaining confidence</p>
<p>through becoming aware of what like your body can do,</p>
<p>the sort of the artistry and the skill of it,</p>
<p>also the power of being able to dominate</p>
<p>another human being with technique,</p>
<p>but also like the, I don&rsquo;t know, the formality,</p>
<p>the discipline of just honoring the tradition of it.</p>
<p>So all of that mixed together somehow creates.</p>
<p>Memories.</p>
<p>It creates memories that kind of define you</p>
<p>as a human being and that you carry that forward</p>
<p>throughout your life.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just been surprised to know</p>
<p>how many powerful people internationally</p>
<p>have like in their heart, in their, who they are, judo.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>At the core of it.</p>
<p>It makes you the human being that you are.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>Like it becomes a fabric of,</p>
<p>the people that stick with it, right?</p>
<p>That stay with it.</p>
<p>Because it, I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so memorable because of what you talked about,</p>
<p>the tradition.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, you grow with other people,</p>
<p>and you learn from other people</p>
<p>and you experience things with other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a hands on sport that it&rsquo;s very memorable.</p>
<p>And people love it so much.</p>
<p>Like right now at my dojo, we have like four generations.</p>
<p>Like somebody that did judo with my dad,</p>
<p>had a kid who trained with me,</p>
<p>who loved judo so much, had a kid.</p>
<p>That kid was now in his 20s who did judo.</p>
<p>And now has a kid who&rsquo;s two or three or four</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming to my toddler program at my school.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re talking four generations.</p>
<p>And they all love the experience so much</p>
<p>and what it did for them and their lives</p>
<p>that they wanted the next generation</p>
<p>to also experience the same thing.</p>
<p>This is a tricky question,</p>
<p>but if people are interested in judo</p>
<p>and want to start learning it,</p>
<p>in the United States there&rsquo;s thousands of jiu jitsu schools,</p>
<p>for example, is there advice you can give</p>
<p>to people interested in judo</p>
<p>or maybe to jiu jitsu gym owners?</p>
<p>Like how do you get judo as part of your life in America?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you&rsquo;re fortunate</p>
<p>to live near another dojo, right?</p>
<p>A place that has judo locally,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s your best opportunity to learn</p>
<p>is to go learn from another school.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo</p>
<p>might not be for two hours or three hours</p>
<p>away from where you&rsquo;re at, which is an obstacle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, Travis and I did start</p>
<p>the American Judo System online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at usajudo.com.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve broken down every single judo technique</p>
<p>to the very, very basic elements of just movement.</p>
<p>So we teach every technique of how you do it mechanically</p>
<p>with just your feet,</p>
<p>then how you incorporate your hands and your feet together,</p>
<p>how you do it in all directions,</p>
<p>moving forward, sideways, backwards,</p>
<p>how to then introduce a partner into the movement,</p>
<p>how to do basic uchi komi or repetitions with a partner,</p>
<p>then moving with a partner,</p>
<p>then how to throw your opponent static,</p>
<p>how to throw your opponent.</p>
<p>So basically from the very foundation of the movement</p>
<p>all the way to the most advanced level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve documented this through separate videos.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve taken now, I think 12 to 15 of standing techniques</p>
<p>combined with a whole bunch of groundwork techniques.</p>
<p>And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out</p>
<p>so that anybody anywhere can learn online</p>
<p>and can ask questions.</p>
<p>We have a live training class every couple of weeks,</p>
<p>every two weeks, he or I answer questions online</p>
<p>for our members.</p>
<p>Ideally, what we&rsquo;d like to do is have a standing curriculum</p>
<p>for jujitsu instructors that want to learn</p>
<p>and become black belts in judo.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how, these are the techniques you need to know.</p>
<p>This is how many reps you need to do.</p>
<p>This is how efficient you need to get at those techniques</p>
<p>to become certified as an instructor</p>
<p>or become a black belt.</p>
<p>And eventually have an online promotion system</p>
<p>where anybody anywhere can just submit videos</p>
<p>and show us that they can do those techniques.</p>
<p>And obviously we&rsquo;ll have people review them.</p>
<p>And this is a dream and a vision,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve already started the platform.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo</p>
<p>where all of their members will start to get access</p>
<p>to this platform as well.</p>
<p>And if we can get that influx of money</p>
<p>and people on the platform, it&rsquo;ll allow us to hire</p>
<p>and grow it faster.</p>
<p>So you also want to do certification there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just instruction.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That would be amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for me personally, sort of,</p>
<p>I mean, mostly in Austin, Texas now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few judo schools, but it&rsquo;s not really.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, and it&rsquo;s just one of those cities</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t quite have, I mean, there&rsquo;s a few,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically just like a few random judo people</p>
<p>that kind of kind of gather together</p>
<p>a couple of times a week, but it&rsquo;s not a system,</p>
<p>a dojo, an instructor, integrated into a jiu jitsu school</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>The problem with most judo dojos right now</p>
<p>is that most of them cater towards the competitive side.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of them do it recreationally,</p>
<p>meaning this isn&rsquo;t how they make a living.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re there three nights a week,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re there five,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re there five nights a week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still only one junior class and one senior class,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one size fits all.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what level you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one size fits all.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t get out of the training</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking to get out of the training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever the instructor&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t learn because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>at the appropriate level for you.</p>
<p>And usually you&rsquo;re pushed into doing randori</p>
<p>where you have no choice</p>
<p>but to do the randori part of the training.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a challenge to go learn.</p>
<p>And then a lot of times the schools are old school,</p>
<p>so they go make you do falls for a half hour.</p>
<p>They make you do things,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re a jujitsu person</p>
<p>who knows how to fall already,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t proven it to the judo instructor</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t break the norm</p>
<p>and say you still have to fall for six months,</p>
<p>which turns a lot of people away as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like any business.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t deliver on your customer&rsquo;s expectations,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have very many customers,</p>
<p>which is the way it is now.</p>
<p>So a lot of people who listen to this,</p>
<p>but in general in the United States</p>
<p>practice Brazilian jujitsu,</p>
<p>which has a lot of similarities to judo</p>
<p>as obviously its origins in judo.</p>
<p>How would you compare the two arts</p>
<p>from the perspective of people</p>
<p>just interested about both arts?</p>
<p>Do you recommend people who do jujitsu get into judo?</p>
<p>How can it enrich their jujitsu?</p>
<p>How do you compare the two arts,</p>
<p>the actual practice of it and why it might be useful to you?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that judo is a hard sport for adults to do.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>Especially people that haven&rsquo;t fallen in a long time,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t very athletic, haven&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I think about my own experience, right?</p>
<p>Other than judo,</p>
<p>when did I ever do like a forward somersault?</p>
<p>Maybe when I was in grade school, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last time I&rsquo;ve left my feet was in grade school.</p>
<p>Most people haven&rsquo;t got off of a chair or a couch.</p>
<p>They spend eight to 10 hours a day</p>
<p>either working behind a computer</p>
<p>or sitting on their couch watching TV, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not that athletic.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t done anything athletic</p>
<p>at least probably since high school, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their last athletic endeavor, most of them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about as an adult,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 35 or 40 wanting to start a sport.</p>
<p>Judo is a really hard sport to start,</p>
<p>especially in today&rsquo;s dojos</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a recreational adult program.</p>
<p>You know, when it&rsquo;s one size fits all, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So for those people,</p>
<p>jujitsu makes a heck of a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Good self defense, it&rsquo;s cerebral,</p>
<p>where you got to use your brain, you&rsquo;re a smaller person,</p>
<p>you have to use technique, you know,</p>
<p>it teaches all the same things as judo,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a safe way to do it.</p>
<p>And because of the validation it has</p>
<p>with the UFC and MMA today, right?</p>
<p>Everybody knows jujitsu.</p>
<p>So now they can be part of mainstream society</p>
<p>and talk intelligently about what they see on television</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s going on on ESPN today, right?</p>
<p>They have some knowledge.</p>
<p>So they have an identity.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a good culture in jujitsu</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s becoming a family.</p>
<p>You know, the dojo is the family place.</p>
<p>You go to feel good, you go to see your friends,</p>
<p>you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?</p>
<p>So it makes a lot of sense why it&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>Judo on the other hand,</p>
<p>I think is a better sport for children to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, I would say fun and interactive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little easier to teach the kids</p>
<p>how to do the throwing skills</p>
<p>and for safety and things like that.</p>
<p>Their body can handle more than the adults can.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less likely to get injured.</p>
<p>It makes them better athletes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a lot more three dimensional in my opinion.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a good fit</p>
<p>between judo can thrive from kids till whatever,</p>
<p>high school, college.</p>
<p>Jujitsu thrives from that 18 year old up, right?</p>
<p>Right now, that&rsquo;s kind of where it is.</p>
<p>So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens</p>
<p>and the college, like early 20s, that kind of.</p>
<p>Or you need to have,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be a successful judo dojo,</p>
<p>you have to have that recreational</p>
<p>fundamental adult program in your school</p>
<p>where people actually come to judo, learn the moves,</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t pushed into randori training</p>
<p>and pushed into things where they&rsquo;re uncomfortable</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t control the situation</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too many unknowns.</p>
<p>You got an education at Browns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody, it&rsquo;s amazing because as an Olympian</p>
<p>and an Olympic coach, you always emphasize</p>
<p>kind of balance and education, all of that side of life.</p>
<p>So developing your brain too.</p>
<p>So you are an Olympic medalist,</p>
<p>a coach of Olympic medalists, you&rsquo;re a business owner.</p>
<p>So successful in all these domains.</p>
<p>So I have to ask, what advice would you give</p>
<p>to young people today, high school, judo age,</p>
<p>high school, college, undergrad,</p>
<p>how to be successful in their career</p>
<p>or just in life in general,</p>
<p>how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think you have to be true to yourself.</p>
<p>You have to decide what it is you really wanna do</p>
<p>with your life.</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s hard because when I grew up,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I was gonna be successful.</p>
<p>When I was young, I didn&rsquo;t know I was gonna be</p>
<p>an Olympic medalist.</p>
<p>I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies</p>
<p>that makes their living exclusively from martial arts</p>
<p>or judo, cause that wasn&rsquo;t really an opportunity</p>
<p>when I was a kid, but I&rsquo;ve created that opportunity.</p>
<p>I would just say that, pick something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>I was stuck in a career before</p>
<p>where I wasn&rsquo;t passionate about it.</p>
<p>And it was my wife who said, Jimmy,</p>
<p>if you can figure out how to make your living</p>
<p>exclusively from martial arts,</p>
<p>where your brain and your heart and your passion</p>
<p>is all towards one thing that you really like,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be successful.</p>
<p>And I left the job.</p>
<p>I had three kids.</p>
<p>I was working for monster.com.</p>
<p>I was in internet marketing</p>
<p>and I was working for that great company,</p>
<p>nothing wrong with the company,</p>
<p>but sitting behind the desk from eight till five.</p>
<p>And then I get to go to judo from six till nine at night.</p>
<p>My whole day is tied up doing something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really not passionate about.</p>
<p>She said, if you can figure out how to make money</p>
<p>from your dojo and other things judo related,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;ll be successful.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s the one that my wife, Marie,</p>
<p>gave me that advice and I would give that to others.</p>
<p>Find something that you love doing</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t feel like work,</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>And if the opportunity doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>how to make money on it, you can create the opportunity.</p>
<p>Be resourceful, figure it out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anybody tell you you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that I could have a 200 person judo school</p>
<p>that only taught judo</p>
<p>because that really didn&rsquo;t exist in this country.</p>
<p>That actually charges money like jujitsu charges.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking not, there&rsquo;s plenty of clubs out there</p>
<p>that charge 10 bucks a month that might have 100 people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not many that,</p>
<p>where the tuition is $150 a month having 200 people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a successful business, but it wasn&rsquo;t done before.</p>
<p>But be passionate about it, understand you&rsquo;re gonna fail,</p>
<p>understand you&rsquo;re gonna get knocked down, beat up, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be dark days, but you gotta persevere.</p>
<p>You gotta believe in yourself.</p>
<p>You gotta have a plan.</p>
<p>You have to be willing to learn from other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know it, I brought somebody in to tell me,</p>
<p>what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Like, look from the outside, what do you see?</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Then you gotta be willing to change.</p>
<p>You gotta be willing to adapt.</p>
<p>And I think listening, believing in myself,</p>
<p>and creating opportunity.</p>
<p>And the other thing is helping others.</p>
<p>Something I always did in my judo life</p>
<p>and in my business life.</p>
<p>If somebody came to me and asked for help with,</p>
<p>hey man, is there something you can do to help me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get this thing started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get this dojo off the ground,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m trying to run this event series,</p>
<p>or I was creative and trying to figure out a way</p>
<p>to help them make it work.</p>
<p>Because if that really was their dream,</p>
<p>and I could help them do their dream,</p>
<p>I felt like that person would then give nothing</p>
<p>but good, good comments about us.</p>
<p>Good, good, like they&rsquo;ll remember it forever.</p>
<p>They become like family.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be the best advocates for your business ever.</p>
<p>And so the kids that I taught at my dojo</p>
<p>were treated that way.</p>
<p>The people that worked for me get treated that way.</p>
<p>The people that, my customers that I work with</p>
<p>and building their dojos,</p>
<p>get treated that way.</p>
<p>People that ran tournaments,</p>
<p>whether it was Grappler&rsquo;s Quest years ago,</p>
<p>and helping that guy with a full set of mats</p>
<p>for his, Brian Simmons with his thing,</p>
<p>or any of the Gracie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It just became like family.</p>
<p>And then I just work hard and deliver</p>
<p>on what I say I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>If I say I&rsquo;m gonna do it, I do it.</p>
<p>And I think it goes a long way.</p>
<p>Well, and I got a comment.</p>
<p>So in a small way, people may not know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s still on YouTube.</p>
<p>We previously talked many years ago.</p>
<p>And I remember it, you were so kind to me.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t really know who I was.</p>
<p>You just took me as a human being.</p>
<p>You welcomed me into your dojo.</p>
<p>And we just had a conversation on a podcast</p>
<p>or whatever the heck you call that thing.</p>
<p>And you were just very kind.</p>
<p>And you were also just,</p>
<p>it was the last conversation I had</p>
<p>when I showed up to MIT,</p>
<p>and it stayed with me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve resumed doing this podcast.</p>
<p>But it stayed with me because you said</p>
<p>that I did a good job at this.</p>
<p>And people, especially at that time,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tell me that.</p>
<p>And just that little act of kindness</p>
<p>is probably just a regular part of your day.</p>
<p>You had a busy day, it was the end of the day.</p>
<p>Just saying that, that was powerful.</p>
<p>And that pays off somehow.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was sincere, right?</p>
<p>It was genuine.</p>
<p>I felt like I had been to so many interviews.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s around the Olympic time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of beat reporters that come out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to get your time.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re there because they have to get the story</p>
<p>for their newspaper or their television show.</p>
<p>And a lot of times those people show up, right?</p>
<p>And they pronounce my name wrong.</p>
<p>Or they get something wrong about the background.</p>
<p>Or they offend me because they call me for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>Or they call me five minutes before</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re supposed to be there and say,</p>
<p>oh, sorry, we&rsquo;re running late.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be there in an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a busy guy too.</p>
<p>But you were somebody that showed up,</p>
<p>was so prepared with your notes,</p>
<p>knew everything about the history of what I had done.</p>
<p>The questions you asked were intelligent questions.</p>
<p>They were well thought out.</p>
<p>And at the end of that interview,</p>
<p>I was really genuinely impressed.</p>
<p>And I wanted to let you know you did a great job</p>
<p>and you stood out from the rest.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, it was like showing up to like the Mecca,</p>
<p>like the track.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t always want to just tell that to people,</p>
<p>but you show up, you know,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re the legend of judo in the United States.</p>
<p>And so that was like, Boston is the Mecca.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where you travel to talk to the great.</p>
<p>So the fact that you were kind to me</p>
<p>just stuck with me for a long time.</p>
<p>So it pays off to be kind to others,</p>
<p>to give them a chance.</p>
<p>Jimmy, thank you so much for giving me another chance</p>
<p>and spending your valuable time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also were kind enough to invite me</p>
<p>to train with you today at your dojo.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go do some judo.</p>
<p>Yeah, awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Pedro.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you some words from Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,</p>
<p>but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
