    <p>Hey everybody welcome to the all in podcast it</p>
<p>was a slow news week. So we decided we&rsquo;d give you a special</p>
<p>episode. We&rsquo;re going to go around the horn with our special</p>
<p>picks. We&rsquo;re each going to pick three picks everybody. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pick our favorite recipe, our favorite new hobby</p>
<p>and our favorite streaming guilty pleasure, because there</p>
<p>was no news with us today. The dictator Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
<p>Rain Man David Sachs with his new track from Young Spielberg</p>
<p>just ripping across the charts. Young Spielberg at it again this</p>
<p>time with a track focused on the rain man himself and the</p>
<p>queen of quinoa, who everybody says we should upgrade to the</p>
<p>king of quinoa.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so sexist. Why is that an upgrade? The queen of quinoa is</p>
<p>better. I don&rsquo;t know people just felt I was being I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how people could say that anointing him as queen would be</p>
<p>derogatory. I think these people are not woke and they need to be</p>
<p>canceled.</p>
<p>Jason, here you go again, making a lot of assumptions about</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s pronouns. Yeah.</p>
<p>They queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I take no offense. I take no offense to your insults to me.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m having the emotion of excitement and I am ready for</p>
<p>the conversation.</p>
<p>Good. We got the firmware upgraded. Alright, so I think we</p>
<p>might as well start with I don&rsquo;t know if you guys caught this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a red subreddit called Wall Street Badger. And</p>
<p>called Wall Street bets. And what they do on Wall Street bets</p>
<p>is they find angles and a thesis and then they bet on a stock,</p>
<p>the stock they picked for the past couple of months has been</p>
<p>GameStop. And boy, actually, Jason, hold on a second. Ram</p>
<p>is yes, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s not true. So do you I had</p>
<p>actually a guy on my team put together two really important</p>
<p>documents, and I&rsquo;m just going to read them because it&rsquo;s full of</p>
<p>so much interesting shit. And then we can talk about where</p>
<p>are these documents from? You&rsquo;re saying from the Wall Street</p>
<p>bets? No, no, no, no, I had a guy go in one of my team members,</p>
<p>one of my colleagues and go and summarize the entire saga from</p>
<p>the beginning. And then we can talk about the the corporatist</p>
<p>scumbags at Robin Hood and other fucking people over. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do that. Okay.</p>
<p>This is why they call him the dictator.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with your bias. And no, no, shut up. boring.</p>
<p>Document. Go. You&rsquo;re an idiot, because you you just want to</p>
<p>defend people because you blindly stumbled into a fucking</p>
<p>trade that actually made a little money. Lo and behold, you</p>
<p>actually invested in a company that literally they got on</p>
<p>television yesterday, and they fucking lied to Americans right</p>
<p>to their face. This is a company that was insolvent, because now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just put a pin in the following data point, which I</p>
<p>believe to be true. I know more about this than you do, because</p>
<p>I live in these markets. Okay, so I understand what it means to</p>
<p>be putting on trades to being short to being gamma squeezed to</p>
<p>have longs to do all of this risk management. You&rsquo;re an early</p>
<p>stage investor. So I know the intricacies of this stuff and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in your this company was insolvent. They did</p>
<p>not have the capital requirements to post the margin</p>
<p>that was being asked of them by their partners. And so this was</p>
<p>a platform level decision to ban and block people from trading</p>
<p>securities. It costs individuals hundreds of millions, probably</p>
<p>billions, maybe even 10s of billions and these motherfuckers</p>
<p>should go to jail. Now let me give you the timeline before we</p>
<p>get into that. June 2019. In June of 2019, a Wall Street bets</p>
<p>user named deep fucking value began buying long dated January</p>
<p>21 calls. What that means is, in June of 19, this person was</p>
<p>betting that the stock would go up by January of 2021. He spent</p>
<p>$50,000, which by the way, today is worth about $25 million. By</p>
<p>the way, we should just highlight that there are forums</p>
<p>where individuals that are trading stocks talk to each</p>
<p>other and share tips and promote things to one another. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where this was taking place. Yeah. And by the way, those</p>
<p>forums exist in the professional organized world to amongst hedge</p>
<p>funds. You know, I&rsquo;ve been invited to idea dinners where we</p>
<p>all get together and we talk about the ideas that we have and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all expected to do fundamental analysis. But some</p>
<p>of those ideas are actually momentum driven ideas. And a lot</p>
<p>of the biggest dislocations in the market, just as a setup</p>
<p>here, have been because of momentum driven trading by</p>
<p>organized capital. Okay, so we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve been stuck with this</p>
<p>for a while. So, so this guy deep fucking value post this and</p>
<p>every month since he&rsquo;s posted a screenshot of his position and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s titled it GME YOLO update. August 22nd of 2019. Michael</p>
<p>Burry, who is this guy famous from the big short, who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>guy that caught the mortgage thing. He discloses a 3% position</p>
<p>in the company. And he highlights that 90% 90% of Game</p>
<p>Stops 5700 stores are free cash flow positive. That&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pretty good. He urges a buyback and he notes that the company</p>
<p>was trading at or near net cash levels. So he&rsquo;s making a deep</p>
<p>value oriented fundamental thesis as well.</p>
<p>Come on. I think also it&rsquo;s worth saying what GameStop is</p>
<p>because even my wife asked me what the hell is GameStop last</p>
<p>night. GameStop is a retail store where people buy video</p>
<p>games. I used to go to the mall all the time and consoles and</p>
<p>headphones and other stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll buy back your old games.</p>
<p>And so the stock got beat up over the last couple years as</p>
<p>people stopped going to malls and stopped buying stuff in</p>
<p>stores, and everyone thought that the company was going to</p>
<p>die. And so these guys observed that maybe there&rsquo;s real value in</p>
<p>this company and making money</p>
<p>digital downloads are</p>
<p>no one buys DVD roms anymore or anything like that. So</p>
<p>and and the chewy founder who is very successful at e commerce</p>
<p>came in to run the company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best part of the story. So June 19 was the</p>
<p>original post August 22 of 19. Michael Burry comes in and says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m long. Then a year later, August 31 of 2020. Ryan Cohen,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the founder of chewy, takes an almost 10% position in</p>
<p>GameStop. About two or three weeks later, on September 19 of</p>
<p>last year, a member of Wall Street bets writes a post on</p>
<p>GameStop. And he notes that GameStop has 120% short</p>
<p>interest, which I&rsquo;ll get to in a second. So hold on, what what</p>
<p>does that mean? 120% short interest. And he defends the</p>
<p>company as a result of a few things. He says number one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new console cycle coming just as Jason mentioned.</p>
<p>Number two, consoles are are not going all digital immediately.</p>
<p>GameStop loyalty programs have 55 million users, they have a</p>
<p>strong balance sheet, Ryan Cohen just bought a stake. And the</p>
<p>shorts were underwater and would be forced to cover if the stock</p>
<p>ran up. He predicted the convergence of all these factors</p>
<p>would lead to a big squeeze. Now November 16 of 2020. Ryan</p>
<p>Cohen writes a letter to the GameStop board. And he urges the</p>
<p>company to conduct a strategic review and share a credible plan</p>
<p>to capture market share in the gaming industry. He said that</p>
<p>they need to evolve into a technology company that delights</p>
<p>gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>quoting here, not remain a video game retailer that</p>
<p>overprioritizes its brick and mortar footprint, and stumbles</p>
<p>around the online ecosystem. November of 2020. Someone in</p>
<p>Wall Street bets highlights that a hedge fund called Melvin</p>
<p>Capital was going long GameStop puts what does that mean that</p>
<p>they are synthetically shorting the stock by buying the right to</p>
<p>sell it at a different price in the future. Okay. And that they</p>
<p>had been long that position for more than four years. So all the</p>
<p>way going back to 2016. Fast forward to now 2021 of this</p>
<p>year, January of 2021. GameStop strikes an agreement with Ryan</p>
<p>Cohen and adds him to the board of directors and gives two of</p>
<p>his affiliates, his former COO and CFO of Chewy also to board</p>
<p>seats. They collectively, you know, bring their experience in</p>
<p>e commerce, online marketing, finance and strap planning. The</p>
<p>stock goes up 13% on that day and closes at about 20 bucks a</p>
<p>share. One day later. And then over the next day after that,</p>
<p>so for January 12 and 13 of 2021. There&rsquo;s a ton of activity</p>
<p>around GameStop in Wall Street bets, and now in discord, and in</p>
<p>stock twits, claiming that Ryan Cohen is going to be the savior.</p>
<p>And then by January 14. So three days later, the stock closes at</p>
<p>40 bucks. So now it&rsquo;s up 125%. So now comes to set up the pros</p>
<p>versus the joes. From January 12 to today, there has basically</p>
<p>been a battle by institutional investors on one side, shorting</p>
<p>GameStop and retail investors on the other, buying the stock and</p>
<p>also buying the right to buy the stock or what&rsquo;s called call</p>
<p>options. And this is what has created this crazy nonsense</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen. So on the institutional side, after you</p>
<p>know, retail drives the stock up, the institutional guys are</p>
<p>like, Hey, wait a minute, you know, Ryan Cohen&rsquo;s an idiot. You</p>
<p>know, this company is fucked, fuck these guys, they have too</p>
<p>many, you know, cyclical and secular tailwinds. And they</p>
<p>become so massively short, that the infrastructure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to even count all the shares can&rsquo;t keep up. And now</p>
<p>they are short more than the actual number of shares that</p>
<p>actually exist. So now they&rsquo;re 140% short. The joes retail,</p>
<p>they start to aggressively purchase all these cobble</p>
<p>options. And on January 13, and 14, this price keeps ticking up.</p>
<p>Then a bunch of quant funds and momentum hedge funds notice all</p>
<p>this activity. And they also participate on the long side.</p>
<p>And then over the past seven trading days, we have traded</p>
<p>over $100 billion of stock in GameStop, which is well in</p>
<p>excess of what retail can support. So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>to realize a bunch of value oriented, non computerized, non</p>
<p>quantitative hedge funds short, retail notices a dislocation</p>
<p>initially fundamentally, but then momentum oriented buys.</p>
<p>Other hedge funds realize also by and this is what&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>this massive short squeeze. On January 19. Citroen Research, a</p>
<p>research firm that basically tries to, you know, find shorts</p>
<p>in the market announces that they were short GameStop, and</p>
<p>they gave five reasons why it should go to 20 bucks. The stock</p>
<p>was at 3550 on January 19. Then over the next two days, GameStop</p>
<p>calls hit an all time high. And it runs a two day rally of</p>
<p>almost 70%. And this is what really starts what&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>gamma squeeze. Okay, which is what we saw in the first part of</p>
<p>this week. So January 25. Ken Griffin, Stevie Cohen, they</p>
<p>inject almost $3 billion into Melvin Capital, the firm that</p>
<p>was short, 2 billion from Citadel and 750 from from Stevie</p>
<p>Cohen. Stevie Cohen had a billion in it from before. And</p>
<p>then now all of a sudden, the squeeze keeps happening, the</p>
<p>squeeze keeps happening. And then it starts to spill over to</p>
<p>the rest of the market. Now all these hedge funds, these</p>
<p>original hedge funds, they are getting called by the bank</p>
<p>saying, Hey, wait a minute, you&rsquo;ve run over your collateral</p>
<p>limits, you need to post more collateral, we need more money</p>
<p>in your bank accounts. So now not only do they have to cover</p>
<p>GameStop, they have to cover all their other shorts. So those go</p>
<p>crazy. And they have to sell their longs. So now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>selling, you know, Facebook, Netflix, Alibaba, so those</p>
<p>things are going down. That accordion is what&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>happening in the market in the last couple of days. And then</p>
<p>the coup de gras is what happened on January 28 of 2021.</p>
<p>brokerage firms, and this is where Jason, we should talk</p>
<p>about this, like Robinhood and interactive brokers, because in</p>
<p>fairness, it wasn&rsquo;t just Robinhood prevented their users</p>
<p>from buying GameStop and a handful of other stocks, they</p>
<p>were only able to sell, which resulted in such a one way</p>
<p>pressure, it caused a 44% sell off yesterday. Now, that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>reversed today. And so what it speaks to is a bunch of</p>
<p>questions, there are questions as to whether or not this was</p>
<p>mandated by the platforms or the regulators. Given the fact</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t impact all the brokerage accounts, it was a</p>
<p>platform level decision. So some organizations like Robinhood</p>
<p>banded, some organizations did not. And it could be that some</p>
<p>of these platforms that banded is likely because and this is</p>
<p>where we get to the insolvency question, didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>margin. And so they knew that if they open the doors, there would</p>
<p>be a run on the bank, and there would be a run on Robinhood. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they basically, I believe, had to stop allowing</p>
<p>people to trade. And it just shows how, how fragile the whole</p>
<p>system is. The last thing I&rsquo;ll say, and then we can talk about</p>
<p>this is, how does Robinhood make money, which I think is also</p>
<p>important to understand this Robinhood makes money through a</p>
<p>mechanism that&rsquo;s called payment for order flow. So they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make money from consumers, right? What they do is they</p>
<p>watch and monitor your orders, they create a data file about</p>
<p>that. And they give it to these prime brokerage, prime</p>
<p>brokerage institutions like Citadel milliseconds before you</p>
<p>do the trade. What that allows Citadel to do is if they see a</p>
<p>lot of people buying milliseconds before you buy,</p>
<p>they can buy. And that allows them to make money. So to be</p>
<p>clear, Citadel is responsible for 47% of all the payment for</p>
<p>order flow volume, they paid Robinhood almost $60 million in</p>
<p>the third quarter. Okay. Plus another, I think, you know,</p>
<p>seven and a half million for S&amp;P 500 stocks and 31 million for</p>
<p>non S&amp;P 500 stocks. They paid them almost 100 million in the</p>
<p>quarter or a $400 million run rate. So if we had to summarize</p>
<p>all of this in a nutshell, that&rsquo;s what we know. We know</p>
<p>that it started out as people debating the true fundamental</p>
<p>value of GameStop. And it morphed into a momentum trade,</p>
<p>where a bunch of folks got dogmatic about a short, a bunch</p>
<p>of folks got dogmatic about being long, and belongs one. And</p>
<p>in the middle, what happened was a bunch of firms basically</p>
<p>decided at some point to gate the ability for people to</p>
<p>transact in all of this, which I think caused a lot of economic</p>
<p>disruption. And that was because they didn&rsquo;t have the margin</p>
<p>requirements. And I think it&rsquo;s because they were insolvent, i.e</p>
<p>Robinhood. Jason, over to you.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we probably agree on a lot of things here. Thank</p>
<p>you for the concise. So we agree that Wall Street bets and retail</p>
<p>investors are incredibly powerful now. And we agree that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing. We also probably agree that there are</p>
<p>shenanigans going on with shorting of stocks, ie 120% or</p>
<p>130% short. And we agree, I think that some of these hedge</p>
<p>funds do manipulate the markets with these, we all also agree</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s unfortunate that in order to stay solvent,</p>
<p>Robinhood, apparently, if this is the information, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have complete information right now. So the thing I do think</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re being tremendously unfair about, and I&rsquo;ll try not</p>
<p>to make it personal to mop is that you&rsquo;ve been uncouth, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re attacking people without with partial information. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>let you respond to that in a minute. And I think we agree</p>
<p>that Robinhood is responsible. Robinhood is responsible for</p>
<p>this revolution in retail trading, they created the</p>
<p>platform, and they created the innovation that got millennials</p>
<p>to en masse, embrace trading stocks, how did they do it, they</p>
<p>figured out a clever innovation of how to make it free and</p>
<p>friction free. They did that because they did this selling of</p>
<p>the data in the order flow. Okay, we can debate whether that</p>
<p>is fair or not. But Facebook did the same thing, they created a</p>
<p>data business, they provided amazing products and services</p>
<p>that you yourself built for five years and made a billion dollars</p>
<p>off of, in order to make it free for consumers. Now, there are</p>
<p>unintended consequences of any company at scale, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Uber, Robinhood, Tesla, etc. And they will all have to weather</p>
<p>these storms. And I think that there are pieces of information</p>
<p>that you do not have trauma. And for you to say that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>criminal, and for you to say they&rsquo;re scumbags, and to act</p>
<p>this way is, I think, unprofessional and does you a</p>
<p>disservice and does your argument a disservice. And you</p>
<p>did this as well with Uber, another one of my investments,</p>
<p>and that company weather the storm, and they&rsquo;ve done great</p>
<p>things in the world. And they and I&rsquo;m very proud of that.</p>
<p>And I will be very proud of what I believe that</p>
<p>CEO and they brought in Dara who cleaned it up.</p>
<p>Oh, agreed, agreed, but they got there. And so I believe what</p>
<p>happens. So what do you know that I don&rsquo;t know? Well, I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t talked to Vlad. I saw what he said about Vlad. He</p>
<p>lied on. He lied on television. I don&rsquo;t believe he lied. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not on Fox. Where did he not? What is the lie? Well,</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>he was confronted, he was confronted about whether there</p>
<p>was a liquidity crisis. And he said to their face, no, that is</p>
<p>not true.</p>
<p>I think this is being misinterpreted. And there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a clarification that&rsquo;ll car. I think because they were able to</p>
<p>draw down 600 million, and because they were able to take</p>
<p>down a billion dollar investment from the top investors in the</p>
<p>world, that they resolved their liquidity problem. Nobody in</p>
<p>history has ever created this many retail investors, then</p>
<p>Robin Hood, they are responsible for the movement, when they</p>
<p>pitched me the company, they wanted to create this</p>
<p>revolution. It is paradoxical that they are now the enemies of</p>
<p>the revolution because they actually created enable this.</p>
<p>And I and they have been number one in the app store since this</p>
<p>whole fiasco starting</p>
<p>nothing you&rsquo;re saying convinces me that this is the they are the</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns of 2008. To me,</p>
<p>they will not be they will get through this. And there has this</p>
<p>is an unprecedented black swan event. I think we would all</p>
<p>agree. Nobody has</p>
<p>exactly what Lehman and bear said, that is exactly what they</p>
<p>said. And this they will, I believe Robin Hood will write it</p>
<p>out, because they throttle the number of people coming to</p>
<p>platform. Las Vegas is not designed for everybody in</p>
<p>America to come to Las Vegas in the same weekend. Will you</p>
<p>happen? Will you admit that, that the 10s of millions of</p>
<p>people that had their hard earned money inside of Robin</p>
<p>Hood was prevented from participating in trades that</p>
<p>could have been executed other places because of an arbitrary</p>
<p>decision by Robin Hood that they added was an arbitrary, they</p>
<p>have to stay insolvent. How is that? How is that? Jason, Jason,</p>
<p>do you</p>
<p>Jason, that&rsquo;s me telling you that they were insolvent. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not them saying it. This is what I&rsquo;m saying right now.</p>
<p>Communication was not perfect. I&rsquo;ll agree. The communication</p>
<p>was not perfect. They should have just said we had no choice</p>
<p>but to stop this or we would have been insolvent. We cannot</p>
<p>take this many trades that but is that what we call lies when</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s money gets fucked over? Just it&rsquo;s inconvenient. Let me</p>
<p>just say one thing. I&rsquo;m going to enter interject your your your</p>
<p>vigorous debate. The the important thing I think to note</p>
<p>is Robin Hood makes money effectively, as Chamath pointed</p>
<p>out, through arbitrage of pricing in the markets, and by</p>
<p>providing leverage to their clients. So the clients can</p>
<p>trade beyond their means. I used to be an investor in a forex</p>
<p>trading company was the largest forex trading platform in the</p>
<p>world for retail investors. And 60% of those accounts went</p>
<p>bankrupt over time. So there was a lifetime value on an account</p>
<p>because the customer would come in, they trade foreign exchange</p>
<p>rates up and down, they would ultimately just get burnt up.</p>
<p>And that was it. Robin Hood makes money when the market is</p>
<p>non volatile, when there isn&rsquo;t a lot of swings. Suddenly, when</p>
<p>there is a swing, and that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re able to provide their</p>
<p>free pricing to people, they&rsquo;re making a spread. But suddenly,</p>
<p>when there is a swing, and the spread start to widen, they are</p>
<p>actually exposed to losing money. So Jason, it&rsquo;s true what</p>
<p>Chamath is saying, like they did face a liquidity crisis, to some</p>
<p>extent, that&rsquo;s why they agreed. But it was a function of their</p>
<p>business model, right? Their business model provides great</p>
<p>benefit and value in some extent, during good times, but</p>
<p>when times get bad, it&rsquo;s like, oh, shit, things are at risk.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very similar to kind of the Lehman and, you know, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t disagree. I don&rsquo;t disagree. I think this is an</p>
<p>unprecedented situation with a number of participants. It</p>
<p>reminds me of surge pricing with Uber during snowstorms. And that</p>
<p>also was an unintended thing that you know, who knew that it</p>
<p>would go up to $400 to take a ride. And that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>companies will be faced with, and they will have to then</p>
<p>adjust, and then make it work. And I think, you know, in the</p>
<p>case of Robin Hood, they should have just came up on Wednesday</p>
<p>and said, we can&rsquo;t take any more orders, we can&rsquo;t take any more</p>
<p>new customers, we&rsquo;re pausing signups, you&rsquo;ll be on a</p>
<p>waitlist, because we will be insolvent if you guys make any</p>
<p>more trades. And that would have I don&rsquo;t know, I agree with that.</p>
<p>Okay, so Jason, let me just explain the mechanical rookie</p>
<p>Jason, it&rsquo;s beyond poor communication. People were</p>
<p>blocked out of their accounts, like there was hundreds of</p>
<p>incalculable amounts of economic loss.</p>
<p>That was gonna wind up being true, because all these trades</p>
<p>are occurring now. And the stock is rock is a rocket ship. Who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to say no, no, I mean, look, I mean, Jason, aren&rsquo;t the shorts</p>
<p>all covered by now? That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been saying. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>NBC. No, there are still people. How do you know how many people</p>
<p>are short right now? How many shares?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the primes put the data together, and they send it</p>
<p>to us.</p>
<p>Do you have it handy? Because I&rsquo;ve been looking for it online.</p>
<p>And they said 10 times the number of shares short I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>traded hands in the last 10 days, or five. I mean, Jason, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have, I don&rsquo;t have it literally in front of me, but I</p>
<p>could get it in the next. Yeah, just text one of your people.</p>
<p>You got all these researchers there. Good.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I&rsquo;m going to try and thread the needle here. I think</p>
<p>J Cal is right that we shouldn&rsquo;t impugn people&rsquo;s motives without</p>
<p>having all the information. And furthermore, you know, building</p>
<p>these rapidly scaling startups is really tough. And it could</p>
<p>have just been, you know, a function of, you know, not</p>
<p>knowing how to deal with unprecedented growing pain. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t want to be too judgmental.</p>
<p>Can I just stop you there?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s not what no, but David, that&rsquo;s not can I but you</p>
<p>guys are not being accurate. They have known for decades for</p>
<p>years, sorry, dears, how this business work when somebody buys</p>
<p>a call option, they are legally obligated when they send that</p>
<p>order through, they have to post margin on behalf of that</p>
<p>person. So they saw this building. This happened in March</p>
<p>of 2020. They went through this liquidity crisis, they&rsquo;ve had to</p>
<p>draw credit lines before they saw it building in the system.</p>
<p>So this was nothing except negligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, so so I was about to, I hadn&rsquo;t gotten to the point where</p>
<p>I was about to agree with you, Chamath. I mean, look, all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is, even if it was negligence, I&rsquo;m not sure I would</p>
<p>impugn all the motives to them. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to find some common ground with Jake on that point.</p>
<p>But where I totally agree with you, Chamath, is with respect to</p>
<p>the effects of their decision. I mean, the effects of that</p>
<p>decision they made to stop trading, and specifically, they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t stop people from selling, they only stop people from</p>
<p>buying. So they shut down one side of the trade. And the</p>
<p>effect of that was we had these hedge funds from Wall Street,</p>
<p>they were on the ropes, right? I mean, let&rsquo;s discuss who these</p>
<p>guys are. These are the apex predators of Wall Street. They</p>
<p>are in the business of shorting companies to destroy them. I</p>
<p>mean, that is their business model. And they are not</p>
<p>academic traders, okay, who are just speculating on outcome,</p>
<p>they engineer the outcome, right? Look at their tactics,</p>
<p>just watch the show billions, right? They hire PR people, they</p>
<p>hire private investigators, they&rsquo;re participating on these</p>
<p>message boards, spreading disinformation. Look at the the</p>
<p>year of hell that Elon went went through, right? They tried to</p>
<p>destroy like five years. Yeah, yeah, exactly. They tried to</p>
<p>destroy companies to engineer that outcome, they create</p>
<p>nothing, they&rsquo;re in the business of destruction. Now, the</p>
<p>beautiful thing is you had these Reddit kids, these pirates who</p>
<p>published this manifesto, right on Reddit, basically being the</p>
<p>heirs to occupy Wall Street, they recognize look, occupying</p>
<p>like, like a physical space does nothing to these guys, we are</p>
<p>going to hurt them where it counts in their pocketbook, we</p>
<p>are going to get together. And we&rsquo;re going to basically create</p>
<p>a trade mob that&rsquo;s even bigger than their cartel. And they did</p>
<p>they got 2.7 million people taking the other side of this</p>
<p>trade. And then when the hedge funds doubled down, they said,</p>
<p>fuck you, we&rsquo;re gonna double we&rsquo;re gonna triple down. And the</p>
<p>guy on Reddit said, Listen, paraphrasing john Maynard Keynes</p>
<p>said, we can be retarded longer than you can be solvent. And</p>
<p>they were winning. That was what they said, right. And they were</p>
<p>winning the trade. Okay. And Melvin was dead busted. And</p>
<p>Citron was on its way to being dead busted. And they had to go</p>
<p>to Big Papa Stevie Cohn, okay. And Ken Griffin to get to get</p>
<p>their rebias to buy the rebias to get back into the game. Okay.</p>
<p>And then they had these guys on the ropes, they had them felted.</p>
<p>Okay. And then what happens just at the moment where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna like, basically bust them out of the game for good. Robin</p>
<p>Hood shuts down the buy side of the trade. And so what does that</p>
<p>do? It gives these hedge funds time to regroup to unspool the</p>
<p>trade to reposition and save themselves. And to get out of</p>
<p>the trade, if they want to get out of the trade, you can never</p>
<p>take that 24 hour time period back, no matter what Robin Hood</p>
<p>does now. And so I agree with your mouth. This was like, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you? It was tremendous, David, on that point, I think it&rsquo;s, I</p>
<p>am in agreement that the hedge funds deserve to get their asses</p>
<p>kicked. 100%. I also, as I said, we don&rsquo;t have complete</p>
<p>information of why, you know, Robin Hood had to pause trading</p>
<p>and the other platforms. And it was like five platforms, by the</p>
<p>way, that had to stop or else they would be insolvent. Because</p>
<p>nothing like this has ever happened before. This is a run</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s ever seen. And now we&rsquo;re back in the game. And</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think all this attention, then drives more</p>
<p>people to buy GameStop, which is what&rsquo;s happening today. And that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still going to get crushed, because it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>going to have to cover I mean,</p>
<p>we look, I don&rsquo;t like like I said, look, where I agree with</p>
<p>you is I think the consequences of this decision by Robin Hood</p>
<p>were I mean, they were really bad, right? And we finally had</p>
<p>these shorts on the ropes where they deserve to be. Finally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting a taste of their own medicine. Yes. And it was</p>
<p>really bad to pull the plug on on the I wish they wish they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to, I&rsquo;m sure. Okay, exactly. And I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>went into that decision. But here&rsquo;s the thing that I think</p>
<p>kind of stinks about it, is the point that Chamath is making</p>
<p>about who is doing the the trade execution for Robin Hood, those</p>
<p>trades are flowing to Citadel. Well, that&rsquo;s part of it. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of it. But 4047%. But who is now on the short side of the</p>
<p>trade, Citadel went in and bailed out Melvin and Citron.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re on both sides of this trade. Now, how does that</p>
<p>make sense? Well, Citadel? Yeah, but I mean, what I would like to</p>
<p>know specifically, okay, is did anybody from Citadel reach out</p>
<p>and touch Robin Hood? Did anybody at Citadel put in the</p>
<p>fix and saying Robin Hood? Of course, that&rsquo;s a valid question.</p>
<p>valid. We&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna cut you off. You know, unless</p>
<p>you freeze out the buy side. Now look, 99% chance that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen. I don&rsquo;t know. But that is a legitimate question. We</p>
<p>need to actually can I can I just tell you the the question</p>
<p>is important, but the way that you phrase it is you call them</p>
<p>and you basically say, Listen, you need to post $500 million</p>
<p>of margin. Why? Oh, well, these trades, you know what, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to arbitrarily change the margin requirements. Okay. Oh,</p>
<p>hey, you need to raise a you need to post. So then what they</p>
<p>did was they pulled all the credit lines. Okay, they post</p>
<p>margin trades are still happening like crazy, right? All</p>
<p>these people are buying GameStop calls, they have to go. Because</p>
<p>look, when you buy a call when you as a user with David</p>
<p>Friedberg, Keenwah buys a call, Robin Hood becomes synthetically</p>
<p>shorted. Right? Robin Hood doesn&rsquo;t have the share to sell</p>
<p>you, but it&rsquo;s giving it to you. So they&rsquo;re technically short,</p>
<p>they got to go buy it. Okay. So this is what creates this</p>
<p>dynamic where Robin Hood knew they knew every second of every</p>
<p>moment, what was happening, and more importantly, what could</p>
<p>happen. At a minimum, it&rsquo;s negligence. And at a maximum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fix.</p>
<p>Well, it was and it was and it was fine to do it before the</p>
<p>market started to swing volatile, right? And so when the</p>
<p>market wasn&rsquo;t high volume, and when it wasn&rsquo;t volatile, it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter because they had appropriate levels of surplus</p>
<p>capital or statutory capital or whatever the definition is in</p>
<p>this market, to be able to cover the quote unquote, VAR or the</p>
<p>value at risk of their portfolio of their customers worst case</p>
<p>outcome. But as soon as that spiked, as soon as the VAR</p>
<p>spiked, they had to go get more capital. And so what do you do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the manager of Robin Hood in that situation where</p>
<p>your clients who&rsquo;ve been making you a bunch of money by trading</p>
<p>stocks over the last couple of years, suddenly they all get</p>
<p>themselves in a bind where the VAR on the portfolio is more</p>
<p>than the cash Robin Hood has to clear assuming all these people</p>
<p>go bankrupt. That&rsquo;s where Robin Hood had to scramble. And so in</p>
<p>that circumstance, they drew down debt, and they had to go</p>
<p>get a billion dollars of equity. But if you guys were running</p>
<p>that business, and I&rsquo;m not speaking for Robin Hood&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not making the case for Robin Hood, but what would you guys</p>
<p>have done in that circumstance? You know, suddenly all your and</p>
<p>by the way, I&rsquo;m saying they created the problem for</p>
<p>themselves, because they allowed people to trade on margin with</p>
<p>low bank with low account balances and volatile stocks</p>
<p>prior to this, it got away from them.</p>
<p>And this way, you can&rsquo;t, you cannot run a business like that</p>
<p>and be selective and arbitrary. You can&rsquo;t say some stocks on</p>
<p>certain days, some stocks on other days, some options over</p>
<p>here, some puts over there. That means you&rsquo;re a fucking moron.</p>
<p>And what do you do on Tuesday or Wednesday, when all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you&rsquo;re not Tuesday or Wednesday, this, if you were a</p>
<p>reasonable manager of a business like this, this conversation</p>
<p>would have been happening at a board meeting. I quarters ago,</p>
<p>hold on a second, let me finish, please. Okay. It needs to</p>
<p>happen quarters ago. And in quarters ago, what they would</p>
<p>have said is, hey, guys, we&rsquo;ve run some scenario analyses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some sensitivity analyses. Here&rsquo;s what happens if</p>
<p>all of these things can go against us. That&rsquo;s a typical</p>
<p>stress test that a bank has to do, right? When you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>structurally important bank, you have legislation that</p>
<p>forces you to be under these conditions where you have to</p>
<p>make sure that you can understand some of these</p>
<p>scenarios.</p>
<p>And then you have to have any trading entity or insurance</p>
<p>company, they all have to have that analysis of what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst case scenario, and how do you plan for it?</p>
<p>And you have to you and by the way, coming out of 2008, we</p>
<p>actually legislated that we needed to have these two and</p>
<p>three sigma, you know, event scenario planning, and you</p>
<p>needed to have proper credit. So here&rsquo;s what happened really.</p>
<p>Number one, it was under equitized, right at a minimum,</p>
<p>the business was massively relative to what they were</p>
<p>letting their customers do. Exactly. And that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important, because the point is, they let people trade with high</p>
<p>margin, and they let people trade in volatile stocks. And it</p>
<p>was working until not just stocks, but options, which is</p>
<p>what which is what creates the real spin up the feedback loop</p>
<p>that blows this whole thing up.</p>
<p>And then number two is they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think one thing that&rsquo;s really important, I just want to say</p>
<p>this, we should stop pretending that trading in stocks is</p>
<p>investing in businesses. And this is something we&rsquo;ve said for</p>
<p>a long time on Wall Street, but stocks, shorting margin and</p>
<p>derivatives, those, those four things no longer look like what</p>
<p>the capital markets were originally set up for, which was</p>
<p>to help capitalize businesses and allow people to exit their</p>
<p>investment and helping to capitalize that business to</p>
<p>another investor that wants to come along, it has effectively</p>
<p>become a synthetic casino, or a synthetic gambling model that</p>
<p>lets people trade things up and down. And this has been the</p>
<p>mainstay of Wall Street for the last couple of decades. And as</p>
<p>you pointed out, Saks, it really is a leech on the system,</p>
<p>because the amount of money that trading firms and traders and</p>
<p>hedge funds make doing this, ultimately is taking away from</p>
<p>capital that could be invested in actual businesses that could</p>
<p>drive job growth, drive economic prosperity, drive innovation. And</p>
<p>the volatility that I think we&rsquo;ve seen is the ultimate</p>
<p>feedback loop that emerges from when you allow a casino to</p>
<p>operate that sits under the guise of being business capital</p>
<p>and investing in businesses. It&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;ll give you guys a</p>
<p>statistic. I downloaded the data from CBOE that analyzes</p>
<p>how much volume was traded across all the equity markets</p>
<p>last year in the US. Stocks traded a total volume last year,</p>
<p>you guys ready for this $121 trillion of notional across 2.7</p>
<p>trillion trades. Do you think that $121 trillion of notional</p>
<p>equity value trading provided capital to businesses anywhere</p>
<p>close to 1% of that total amount of trading volume? It</p>
<p>really is a synthetic instrument that allows people to</p>
<p>participate in I bet that something is going to go up and</p>
<p>I bet that something is going to go down with other people of an</p>
<p>of a similar ilk. And one person makes money and one person loses</p>
<p>money. And at the end of the day, the underlying business</p>
<p>entity doesn&rsquo;t benefit whatsoever. And you see it when</p>
<p>shorts go against businesses like happened with Elon and</p>
<p>Tesla. And you see it when derivatives like CDOs blow up</p>
<p>the fucking housing market, where people basically trade</p>
<p>these derivatives that sit on top of housing and that capital</p>
<p>did not find its way into homes to help people buy homes, it</p>
<p>ultimately led to the collapse of the only the only reason that</p>
<p>Lehman and Bear Stearns was shut down was in 2007 and eight when</p>
<p>they were in a liquidity crunch in the same thing. And they</p>
<p>basically had all these trades blowing up against them. And</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t collateralize them was that the people on the other</p>
<p>side were hedge funds. And that&rsquo;s why you know, they were</p>
<p>put into the Fed. And that&rsquo;s why we were able to basically like,</p>
<p>you know, come out relatively unscathed. And but I mean, by</p>
<p>relatively unscathed is like a global calamity. The tragedy of</p>
<p>this is that this is the tragedy of the commons. It&rsquo;s like, you</p>
<p>know, there is no organization of people that can say, Hey,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m really rich and wealthy. And what happened here</p>
<p>was wrong, even though it&rsquo;s probably on the same scale. And</p>
<p>so everybody that was a participant in it is, in my</p>
<p>opinion, I think is guilty of all of this, they were, they</p>
<p>were complicit in the robbing of America.</p>
<p>Do you think calls and puts should and shorting should be</p>
<p>allowed? Should those markets exist?</p>
<p>I do have a sense of common sense solutions. And let me let</p>
<p>me kind of give you them. And then you can tell me what you</p>
<p>think. So the first is we need to use modern technology. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just start with that, right to ensure that, you know, one share</p>
<p>of stock, right, isn&rsquo;t loaned out multiple times so that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have a scenario where you have more than 100%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a no brainer, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a no brainer.</p>
<p>So you still support shorting some up?</p>
<p>Yeah, let me let me just go through the list. And then you</p>
<p>can tell me what you think. If if high frequency firms can</p>
<p>trade 10s of millions of shares per day, there&rsquo;s no reason why</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t reconcile who the beneficial owner of every share</p>
<p>is. So maybe that&rsquo;s a, you know, now maybe we found the first</p>
<p>obvious use case for a blockchain, right? Like you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t borrow a share unless you can prove beneficial ownership</p>
<p>in a in a, you know, nanosecond, which can only be done on a, you</p>
<p>know, decentralized ledger. But the point is, number one is, we</p>
<p>need to rebuild this infrastructure, you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>136% of a company be short, that makes no sense. The second,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve learned is that, again, this is like, are we</p>
<p>going to basically have these blow ups every 10 years before</p>
<p>we actually address the elephant in the room, which is leverage,</p>
<p>like you need to have leverage limits. So for example, banks</p>
<p>coming out of a weight have super strict oversight and</p>
<p>leverage limits, because they&rsquo;re dubbed systematically</p>
<p>important. We don&rsquo;t do that for hedge funds. And I think we need</p>
<p>to. And I think that we need to have the ability to realize that</p>
<p>these these guys can cause systemic risks, right. So just</p>
<p>on this example, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have ever heard about</p>
<p>long term capital management.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Asian currency crisis, the whole thing collapsed. So</p>
<p>good. There&rsquo;s a good book on it.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny. But if you guys think this is the</p>
<p>second financial calamity, it&rsquo;s not the first, it&rsquo;s the third,</p>
<p>because the first one happened in 1998. So in 1998,</p>
<p>there was a firm, it was the whole, the whole economic system</p>
<p>was going to collapse if the bailout didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So listen to what these guys did. Long term capital</p>
<p>management borrowed. They had $4.8 billion of capital that</p>
<p>limited partners and investors gave them, okay. These fucking</p>
<p>crooks were able to then borrow $125 billion. $125 billion on</p>
<p>the 4.8 billion of notional. So they were able to lever</p>
<p>themselves up 26 times,</p>
<p>by the way, a synthetic margin, right? No actual capital was</p>
<p>allocated to these to this transaction set. It was all</p>
<p>synthetic, like no, no money moved accounts when</p>
<p>no money moved accounts. So it was literally just writing stuff</p>
<p>against debt that couldn&rsquo;t have existed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they so they built 60,000 trading positions. And</p>
<p>those individual positions represented, again, 1.4 trillion</p>
<p>right US dollars. So you took these guys in a room took 4.8</p>
<p>billion, got knucklehead over here to give them 125. And then</p>
<p>got these knuckleheads to sell them positions. And all of a</p>
<p>sudden, 4.8 billion equaled 1.4 trillion. And so then US US</p>
<p>regulators had to step in, they had to orchestrate a bailout</p>
<p>from a consortium of banks, because they were concerned that</p>
<p>if LTCM collapsed, the whole system would collapse because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t understand. So right. So we have to we have to</p>
<p>put leverage limits on top of hedge funds. The third is we</p>
<p>need to improve disclosure. The rules at the SEC right now is to</p>
<p>discourage disclosure. That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. We</p>
<p>should force everybody to publish what they own on a</p>
<p>weekly or monthly basis, you have the ability to do it, the</p>
<p>technology is simple. So you need to improve disclosure,</p>
<p>because then watchdogs and other people can basically be looking</p>
<p>at it all day and identifying these risks faster, not slower.</p>
<p>The third is we need to do something around open trading.</p>
<p>Like, why is it that you&rsquo;re, you know, people are allowed to go</p>
<p>to casinos, why can you, you know, buy lottery tickets, but</p>
<p>all of a sudden, like, we&rsquo;re going to decide who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>financially literate, a platform like Robinhood can decide what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bought and what&rsquo;s sold, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair. And then the</p>
<p>last thing is, I think that we should have a short term trading</p>
<p>tax. We tried to pass one in 2018 10 basis points, if you</p>
<p>would pass this 10 basis point tax in 2018, on short term</p>
<p>trading, it would have created a trillion dollars almost,</p>
<p>I did the math on this, because I actually, the reason I ran all</p>
<p>the equity numbers was to figure this number out. So in the US,</p>
<p>we generated $160 billion in capital gains tax last year. And</p>
<p>if you look at the volume I described earlier, in terms of</p>
<p>notional traded of equities and number of shares traded, if you</p>
<p>charge point 1%, every time someone sold a share on the</p>
<p>value of the share they sold, it would equal the capital gains</p>
<p>tax. So what you could do is you could charge point 1% on</p>
<p>every trade, it would reduce all of this high frequency nonsense</p>
<p>where people trade in and out of stocks, it would force people to</p>
<p>trade for the longer term or basically invest in companies.</p>
<p>And you could get rid of the capital gains tax. Think about</p>
<p>that. If we didn&rsquo;t have to pay capital gains tax, and we were</p>
<p>only taxed when we traded out of a stock point 1%, you could see</p>
<p>an incredible amount of capital making its way into businesses.</p>
<p>And this would fuel economic growth and jobs and prosperity.</p>
<p>And so I think if you could pull that off, put the two together</p>
<p>at point 1% sales tax on every share sold and get rid of</p>
<p>capital gains tax, it could be incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>The lobbyists got to that bill, but that 10 basis point tax on</p>
<p>high frequency trading, it just means like, look, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to trade a whole bunch of shit every eight seconds, you</p>
<p>just have to pay 10 basis points in and out $777 billion of</p>
<p>incremental revenue to the federal government and it was</p>
<p>lobbied out. And I agree with you. And by the way, the</p>
<p>more money goes in more money makes its way into companies,</p>
<p>right? And that&rsquo;s the you stop all the nonsense where people</p>
<p>are basically trading to bet that something will go up in the</p>
<p>short term. And you get people to make investments in the</p>
<p>business as opposed to the momentum.</p>
<p>Lowering the capital gains rate is genius because I think that</p>
<p>if you if you are a retail investor, and you can for every</p>
<p>year you hold if you can decrease your cap gains by 20%</p>
<p>by the fifth year, now all of a sudden retail folks aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily gambling their owning and their cap gains rate</p>
<p>would be zero after five years, that would be amazing.</p>
<p>I have a basic question. I&rsquo;m interested in your position</p>
<p>sacks and maybe even around the horn. What happens to the if the</p>
<p>short positions get covered, which they&rsquo;re going to be at</p>
<p>some point in GameStop, I would think, or some large amount of</p>
<p>when the short squeeze is off, what happens to the people who</p>
<p>are buying in, you know, to the meme stock as a retail investor,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say over the next 10 days, are they going to be left</p>
<p>holding the bags? Is there any way this company could be worth</p>
<p>20 billion or 25 billion? Because as freeberg points out</p>
<p>there, people are not buying GameStop, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to destroy a hedge fund, who made a stupid manipulative bet.</p>
<p>Great. We all love the the Robin Hood story of that. Not Robin</p>
<p>Hood TM, but the generic term Robin Hood. What what happens to</p>
<p>those people? Are they going to be the last people holding the</p>
<p>bag?</p>
<p>Probably this is not going to end? Well, there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>about that. I totally agree with you that people engaging in this</p>
<p>kind of speculation and buying at these prices, it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to end well. Now, I do think that the Redditors actually had</p>
<p>a brilliant strategy, right? When they noticed that these</p>
<p>hedge funds were overshort, overexposed, and they seized on</p>
<p>that vulnerability, they did to the hedge funds, what the hedge</p>
<p>funds usually do to everybody else, which is find the Achilles</p>
<p>heel, right and pile in. So I think the strategy started</p>
<p>brilliant. Now anyone who&rsquo;s piling into it, I&rsquo;d be real</p>
<p>careful because I think the hedge funds have regrouped, you</p>
<p>know, and, you know, the idea that you&rsquo;re going to be beat</p>
<p>them at their own game, you know, when, look, I mean,</p>
<p>Citadel is executing your trades. I mean, right, that the</p>
<p>trades are the order flow is going from Robin Hood to</p>
<p>Citadel, they&rsquo;re not going to be caught flatfooted, they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the other side of this trade. And so, you know, I just think</p>
<p>the house always wins, I&rsquo;d be real careful about getting into</p>
<p>it at this point.</p>
<p>I think, just so you guys know, Robin Hood just tweeted that now</p>
<p>the list of restricted names is now up to almost 35 or 40.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re randomly picking companies, guys, RLX. What is</p>
<p>RLX? I think that&rsquo;s a Ralph Lauren. Nope, you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to trade that. SNDL. I don&rsquo;t know what that is. But you can</p>
<p>only buy 10 shares.</p>
<p>Would a better solution Chamath be for them if they can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>this and they have the risk of ruin to just say we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>adding any more accounts until we can digest all this and raise</p>
<p>enough capital to float all this? And do you think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chance the SEC is telling them, you got to pump the brakes on</p>
<p>this because we can&rsquo;t have a market crash? Two questions</p>
<p>tomorrow.</p>
<p>I think that the the issue isn&rsquo;t Robin Hood&rsquo;s ability to grow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t have their ability to run their business.</p>
<p>And so their incompetence is going to cause them to, I think</p>
<p>have to deal with</p>
<p>if they had 20, well, if they had $20 billion in cash right</p>
<p>now, this would not be an issue, right?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Okay, so assuming they can line that up, because that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on right now is a $10 billion investment is going</p>
<p>to go into this company pre IPO so that they can actually take</p>
<p>advantage of this situation and grow. So despite the fact that</p>
<p>you have an axe to grind with them, because you have so far a</p>
<p>competitor that&rsquo;s very far behind them that had its own</p>
<p>colossal problems. Let&rsquo;s put that aside for a second, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking your own book without even mentioning it. Do you think</p>
<p>that if they had that 10 billion, they would just open up</p>
<p>all the doors? Or do you think maybe they should say, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to add anybody else?</p>
<p>I think that what&rsquo;s going to happen is they&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>sued into oblivion. I think that the class action lawsuits here</p>
<p>when people talk about the implied losses that that they</p>
<p>that they had over the last 24 hours, David Sachs is right, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t undo it. The thing is, like what in all of these other</p>
<p>situations, like in the Uber fiasco, you know, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>claim much damage, right? Because you can&rsquo;t measure it,</p>
<p>you could have taken a bus, you could have taken a taxi, you</p>
<p>know, you could have taken a lift, maybe you could have</p>
<p>walked, who knows what it is. But the point is that the the</p>
<p>economic impacts, I think, were much less than maybe the</p>
<p>psychological impact, right? Like you were angry. Here, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the exact opposite, which is that you prevented people from</p>
<p>transacting in an open market. And when people signed up to use</p>
<p>the service, that&rsquo;s what they thought they were signing up for.</p>
<p>And they thought that that the risk on the back end would be</p>
<p>managed. You have to remember, it&rsquo;s not that the individuals</p>
<p>did anything wrong by buying or selling. It&rsquo;s that Robin Hood did</p>
<p>something wrong by not being able to manage their business</p>
<p>accurately. And then that then impacted the users to the tune</p>
<p>of 10s of billions of dollars that has to get adjudicated. And</p>
<p>so yeah, I think the right thing to do is to stop the business,</p>
<p>hit the pause button, allow people to elegantly transfer</p>
<p>their money out, do we have to remember, on the back end of</p>
<p>this, whenever that you have one of these market failures, the</p>
<p>clearing houses are allowed to instantaneously close your</p>
<p>account and transfer to another broker. Instantaneously, you</p>
<p>have that right. And so the market does understand the</p>
<p>systemic risk at some level, they just didn&rsquo;t push it all the</p>
<p>way through to the end of retail. And so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to unwind this and unscramble this egg, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really, it&rsquo;s a really big problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, you</p>
<p>imagine growing, growing willy nilly, because everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>infatuated with valuations and blah, blah, blah. And you move</p>
<p>into a regulated market where you needed to understand capital</p>
<p>constraints, you needed to understand modeling, you need to</p>
<p>understand three and four sigma events. It just means you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>underprepared, which means at a minimum, you can&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>business until you get that shit under control.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually think we&rsquo;re almost in sync on this. You have</p>
<p>a little bit of an axe to grind because of your other portfolio</p>
<p>company, I think that you still won&rsquo;t recognize that you have a</p>
<p>no wait, let&rsquo;s talk about worse in the race. Wait, let&rsquo;s go so</p>
<p>far. I just did they did they finish resolving all of their</p>
<p>harassment lawsuits? Is that all resolved now? Or is that still</p>
<p>open? Yeah, we&rsquo;ve we had you took them public. So did did you</p>
<p>work all that out before you took them public? Yeah, Jason,</p>
<p>we we transitioned the CEO, we&rsquo;ve completely hired a new</p>
<p>team. Great. I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible. So your company that</p>
<p>you took public can resolve issues, and you can give them</p>
<p>time. And then you can, in fact, become their mentor. And you can</p>
<p>become their savior to get them public and save that company.</p>
<p>Jason, you should Robin Hood can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Jamal can&rsquo;t Jamal can&rsquo;t talk about his company that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>public right now. So just as his lawyer, I&rsquo;m going to step</p>
<p>in and okay, no, no, I just want to point out, make sure you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go to him into saying something.</p>
<p>All of our companies, and I don&rsquo;t mean to create a lot of</p>
<p>collateral damage here. But sacks had a company that had</p>
<p>challenges. Chamath had companies of challenges, we all</p>
<p>had companies have challenges. And I think focusing on what is</p>
<p>the role of an investor, when your company faces challenges, I</p>
<p>think the role of the investor should be and I take umbrage to</p>
<p>you Chamath trying to dunk on me, because I&rsquo;m supporting an</p>
<p>investment. I think it&rsquo;s a low blow. And I take it personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be totally honest, I am trying to work with the company</p>
<p>to help them resolve the issues. And I need to be loyal to my</p>
<p>founders. And I need to say, hey, how do we resolve this? How</p>
<p>do we get here and work with them? And I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ride or die. But that&rsquo;s how I approach this is I should be</p>
<p>trying to be helpful as a shareholder. Could you try to be</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>But could you make the argument that someone dunking on your</p>
<p>company is the equivalent of a hedge fund shorting a company?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about my personal relationship with Chamath, which,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s different than, you know, the public markets,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But I, what I&rsquo;m saying is, like, I think in the private markets,</p>
<p>we hear a lot about venture investors, you know, often</p>
<p>speaking good about their own companies, where people really</p>
<p>get irritated is when venture investors speak bad about other</p>
<p>companies, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of the hedge fund short. And I</p>
<p>mean,</p>
<p>Jake, I mean, Chamath, maybe dunking on Robin Hood, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear him dunking on you. I mean,</p>
<p>I just said, I stumbled into the investment at the opening.</p>
<p>Well, you stumbled into Vlad in a bar. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you told me. Jason, you told the story. Jason, you</p>
<p>told the story.</p>
<p>He recognized me in a bar and came up and</p>
<p>fine Jason, but you told the story flippantly on television</p>
<p>that you ran into man Antonio&rsquo;s nuthouse. What do you want us to</p>
<p>think? You didn&rsquo;t tell us. Listen, I had I had systematic</p>
<p>scouts reach out based on traffic growth. I sat down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my that&rsquo;s not how I get to flow by doing a podcast.</p>
<p>Then Jake, if you want me to apologize for saying flow is</p>
<p>through this podcast. But Jason, if you want me to apologize for</p>
<p>saying that you stumbled into it based on your public description</p>
<p>on television, then I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t take away from what we have. I think the</p>
<p>investors responsibility. This is what I think is fundamentally</p>
<p>wrong with Silicon Valley. We are people that basically do</p>
<p>this, like hero worship around founders, and it&rsquo;s stupid. I</p>
<p>think we have a job as fiduciaries to the users, and to</p>
<p>the employees, and to everybody else that doesn&rsquo;t have a voice.</p>
<p>And most investors are incapable of actually pushing people to do</p>
<p>the right thing. Okay, I&rsquo;m pushing to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And I always learned the hard way. And in this example, what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying is, this problem should have been solved three</p>
<p>and four quarters ago. And that&rsquo;s a government. Yeah, I</p>
<p>mean, look, yeah, you&rsquo;re such a mouth. You&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>But I mean, just to give Jake out a little support here. I</p>
<p>mean, the reality is, you know, we&rsquo;ve all been on the inside of</p>
<p>these hyper growth companies. And, you know, like mistakes</p>
<p>happen all the time, because you&rsquo;re moving so fast. And yes,</p>
<p>it should have, it should have been fixed. You know, but but,</p>
<p>you know, stuff happens. Now, the question is, when bad stuff</p>
<p>happens, is it an integrity issue? Or is it negligence? Or</p>
<p>is it just people running too fast? And I don&rsquo;t think we know</p>
<p>that this was an integrity problem. I mean, it could have</p>
<p>just been people running too fast.</p>
<p>But David, that&rsquo;s what you knew what the rules were. Meaning, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I think it is an integrity issue. The rules were</p>
<p>not like all of a sudden in a crystal ball and all of there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a magic eight ball that spits out a rule when you do a deal</p>
<p>with DTCC. When you did a deal with your holding company for</p>
<p>clearing, you sign contracts, those contracts should have been</p>
<p>modelable. This is an Excel problem. This is not like I hear</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying. And I&rsquo;m saying I don&rsquo;t completely know,</p>
<p>I want to get to the bottom of the relationship between</p>
<p>Citadel and Robin Hood. And I want to understand if there was</p>
<p>any undue influence there, okay, or whether this was just</p>
<p>a case of hyper growth catching a company by surprise. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>defending them. I&rsquo;m just saying I don&rsquo;t know. And therefore, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a little bit premature to be talking about</p>
<p>giving this company.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t think is there even a possibility that this has</p>
<p>ever happened in the history of the stock market or the modern</p>
<p>stock market? That 10 million new and well, hold on, I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say what it is. 10 million new retail investors came into a</p>
<p>stock, you know, or millions of them a day, and that the stock</p>
<p>traded hands. And I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ve ever had social media</p>
<p>collide with finance like this. And it&rsquo;s very reminiscent of our</p>
<p>discussions with democracy, and journalism, censorship, and</p>
<p>politics, we are having weird behaviors because of virality.</p>
<p>And I think</p>
<p>this is the most important learning from this experience,</p>
<p>forget about the fiduciary and the governance responsibility of</p>
<p>these companies, whether they were good or bad will be</p>
<p>resolved over the next couple of weeks and months, I&rsquo;m sure, as</p>
<p>more information comes to light. But what&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>about what happened this week, and I think is the most</p>
<p>impactful societally over time, is that we&rsquo;re seeing this</p>
<p>phenomena where individuals in aggregate can believe something</p>
<p>to be true, and make it true. And we saw this with Tesla. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think Tesla got this level of notoriety because it was such</p>
<p>a longer playout cycle. But Elon, you know, was not hitting</p>
<p>numbers that people thought he was going to hit margins,</p>
<p>production volume, etc. People were shorting the stock. But</p>
<p>enough people believed in the story that Elon told about what</p>
<p>he wanted the future to look like, that they bought the stock</p>
<p>and that gave him the ability to do shelf offerings, raise</p>
<p>additional capital, and ultimately build the business</p>
<p>and make it manifest in reality that he said would happen. And</p>
<p>the same is true of Bitcoin. And the same is true of Trump. And</p>
<p>the same is true of storming the capital. In all of these cases,</p>
<p>there was a belief in something, and there was an</p>
<p>aggregation of individuals using social media as a mechanism for</p>
<p>sharing and talking and engaging and creating a collective</p>
<p>outcome that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened through a centralized</p>
<p>system or a centralized process, and wouldn&rsquo;t have happened in</p>
<p>the traditional way where history defines the future. And</p>
<p>I think that is what&rsquo;s so powerful about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>right now. And we&rsquo;re seeing it in financial markets, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also seeing it play out in politics. And we&rsquo;re seeing it</p>
<p>play out in the real world, in a remarkable way. And it goes</p>
<p>back to this notion that like a stock is worth the underlying</p>
<p>value of the company. And that&rsquo;s not true. People can dream a</p>
<p>stock to be anything as they did with Tesla at the time that</p>
<p>people were buying Tesla stock, the historical performance of</p>
<p>that business was not what hedge funds considered to be a, you</p>
<p>know, a profitable good business. It shouldn&rsquo;t be worth</p>
<p>anything. But the belief in what it could be is what drove the</p>
<p>value of that stock. And ultimately, that value enabled</p>
<p>that business to become true. And it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s amazing to</p>
<p>see it happening. And I think the counter, which is really</p>
<p>what makes this so striking is the centralized institutions</p>
<p>that are trying to block this from happening. And the shutting</p>
<p>down of parlor and the shutting down of Robin Hood trading are</p>
<p>equivalent, from my point of view, or at least equivalent, I</p>
<p>think will be perceived to be equivalent broadly, which is if</p>
<p>a group of people get together and try and use an online</p>
<p>service to make a change in the world, by sharing and talking</p>
<p>with one another and communicating a belief, a</p>
<p>collective belief, and that gets yanked away from them, that</p>
<p>institution that has the ability to yank it away from them is</p>
<p>evil, and it will force people to decentralize and it will</p>
<p>enable new ways of trading new ways of communicating new ways</p>
<p>of building. And that&rsquo;s the profound change that I think</p>
<p>this decade is going to realize. And we&rsquo;re just seeing it start</p>
<p>I agree that parlor or Wall Street bets is parlor 2.0. Right?</p>
<p>And what happened as soon as Wall Street bets started, which</p>
<p>is the the Reddit kids, they started threatening, and they</p>
<p>wounded these powerful insiders, these rich, you know, hedge fund</p>
<p>magnates, what happened, they started getting banned off of</p>
<p>discord, they got discord as a tech company to kick them off.</p>
<p>How did that happen? They&rsquo;ve been talking on there for months.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, just magically right, the critical</p>
<p>moment where they&rsquo;re also not allowed to trade, their free</p>
<p>speech gets cut off. That&rsquo;s a that was deliberate. Now, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you how it happens is I guarantee you what these hedge</p>
<p>funds did is they went through the discord room, and they</p>
<p>screenshotted, you know, any post that they could plausibly</p>
<p>characterize as, you know, hate speech or what have you. And,</p>
<p>you know, and by the way, I mean, those there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>raunchiness in these rooms, but it&rsquo;s not hate speech. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not organized for the purpose of hate. It&rsquo;s organized for the</p>
<p>purpose of trades. But what they do is they weaponize the</p>
<p>censorship rules, and they go in and they screenshot and then</p>
<p>they give it to discord, and they get these guys kicked off.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been talking about with</p>
<p>censorship, it starts with something you like, and then</p>
<p>becomes something you don&rsquo;t. How many of the people who support</p>
<p>these, you know, Reddit kids were in favor of deplatforming</p>
<p>Trump and parlor, and now they can see where it goes. This is</p>
<p>a slippery slope, and we&rsquo;ve only had to wait three weeks to</p>
<p>see where it goes. It goes to the same place, which is when</p>
<p>the people in power get threatened, they use these</p>
<p>rules, they weaponize these rules to shut down the outsiders</p>
<p>and the upstarts. That is a problem with censorship. That is</p>
<p>why you cannot let the beast get started.</p>
<p>I completely agree. And I think this is exactly why how I think</p>
<p>where we came out was, you know, the deplatforming of Trump made</p>
<p>no sense. I think the the economic censorship of Robin</p>
<p>Hood makes no sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can argue it&rsquo;s the right thing to do with a narrow</p>
<p>context. But when you take the broader point of view of the</p>
<p>implications, that&rsquo;s where this becomes really shaky and really</p>
<p>scary. And I think really enables a decentralized</p>
<p>movement that is going to be a lot broader than than folks are</p>
<p>really realizing at this point, you know, folks don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>trading on a system that tells them how to trade and folks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be communicating on a system that tells them how</p>
<p>to communicate.</p>
<p>If I gave if I was running Robin Hood, and I said, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have two options, there&rsquo;s gonna be a Robin Hood diamond</p>
<p>membership, and you pay by the trade. And, you know, you get</p>
<p>these special features, and then the Robin Hood free, you know,</p>
<p>you get your data is sold, or however it works. Would that be</p>
<p>a possible solution, I think, to the optics issue here where</p>
<p>consumers could basically pick just like a Facebook or</p>
<p>Instagram woke up one day and said, for 995 a month, you can</p>
<p>have none of your data, no advertising, ad free, like Hulu</p>
<p>does, you get Hulu premium,</p>
<p>I would. So here&rsquo;s the thing, Jake out. I hope your Robin Hood</p>
<p>investment is successful. I just think that there are now three</p>
<p>moments in Robin Hood&rsquo;s life, there is pre this week. And it</p>
<p>is what it is, it&rsquo;s an $11 billion unicorn, God bless them.</p>
<p>Then there was this week, where we have to frankly hold people</p>
<p>accountable for the economic damage that they created this</p>
<p>week, because it is measurable. Okay, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like missing, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not like, you know, surge</p>
<p>pricing in Uber, it&rsquo;s not, you know, Facebook growing too fast</p>
<p>and allowing, you know, pictures of breasts getting posted, not</p>
<p>have to catch up. It&rsquo;s not that. Okay, it&rsquo;s not a bunch of like</p>
<p>disinformation that we can&rsquo;t really judge, this is very</p>
<p>discreetly judgeable. And so in this week, Robin Hood existed as</p>
<p>a different company. And I think that there&rsquo;s an implication for</p>
<p>that, then to your point, honestly, I agree with you, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happens from here. And I and they should survive, but</p>
<p>they have to learn. And I think what they have to learn is you</p>
<p>have to stop the account growth, you have to massively shore up</p>
<p>the balance sheet, take the dilution, get the capital you</p>
<p>need, because let&rsquo;s be honest, I&rsquo;m sorry, but nobody&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>show up with five or $10 billion at 11 billion pre, they&rsquo;ll show</p>
<p>up with five or $10 billion at 3 billion pre, and they should</p>
<p>take the money. And then they should allow the platform to</p>
<p>work as intended, or at least as perceived to be intended to</p>
<p>their users, and then they should reopen to everybody. What</p>
<p>would you do, David, if you were in charge? And then let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on to our next topic?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I feel like we probably talked about Robin Hood</p>
<p>enough. And I kind of want to go back to the point that that</p>
<p>Freeberg was making just kind of up leveling this a minute, which</p>
<p>is I definitely think this is part of this ongoing populism</p>
<p>versus the elites war. And social media is now the tool</p>
<p>that the people use to organize themselves against these</p>
<p>powerful elites. It&rsquo;s why we cannot allow censorship,</p>
<p>because it always comes down it to benefit the powerful the</p>
<p>elites against the people are trying to organize against</p>
<p>them. That was, to me, one of the biggest takeaways from this</p>
<p>week. And, and look, the reason why people are organizing is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking the question, what is the societal benefit of</p>
<p>these big hedge funds in relation to the enormous sums of</p>
<p>money they make every year, you go to like the Forbes rich list</p>
<p>or whatever. And every year, these guys are taking down the</p>
<p>most money, they&rsquo;re not creating companies, you know, and</p>
<p>Chamath is right, we can&rsquo;t have founder worship, because they</p>
<p>make mistakes, too. But at least founders are creating things,</p>
<p>right? They&rsquo;re taking big risks, that they&rsquo;re not providing risk</p>
<p>capital, like what we do, okay, we&rsquo;re investors, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funding people&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re taking the risk of</p>
<p>writing checks to start the guy who&rsquo;s got nothing, right? Or</p>
<p>gal, yep, you know, they, them, it&rsquo;s all good. All of them. So,</p>
<p>so, but try to keep you from getting canceled here.</p>
<p>But, but, but, but what, what exactly is the societal value of</p>
<p>these hedge funds? I know that they provide some price</p>
<p>discovery, and they provide greater liquidity to markets,</p>
<p>but is that really worth them really being the richest players</p>
<p>in the game? It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. And then when they lose,</p>
<p>like in 2008, they get bailed out. It makes no sense. It</p>
<p>makes no sense. Something is wrong here. Now, is this a</p>
<p>right wing view, a left wing view, it feels to me like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a political realignment happening here, where the left</p>
<p>and the right, we&rsquo;re all getting on board with this idea, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to get fixed.</p>
<p>Yeah, this, this might be the legacy of Trumpet away sacks,</p>
<p>that he created so much disruption over those four</p>
<p>years, that now we&rsquo;re actually finding out where the actual</p>
<p>breaking points are in society. And this is one of them. And the</p>
<p>healthcare system is one of them. And freedom of speech is</p>
<p>one of them. And we need to address each of these. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re complex, but there is common ground. I mean, when AOC</p>
<p>and Ted Cruz are both agreeing on the same issue with something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here, like, I think we have to fight the real enemy</p>
<p>Chamath and I should not be fighting over this. Because I</p>
<p>can tell you, if Chamath did the series a and this, he would be</p>
<p>backing up Robin Hood like this, to the end of the end of earth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s totally fine. And I agree with Jason, I just I just</p>
<p>want you to know, number one, I love you with all my heart. And</p>
<p>I hope you make I hope you I hope you make ditto hundreds and</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of dollars. But there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>you know, you were you just got upset with me because you</p>
<p>thought I was kind of saying that you stumbled into it. I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t mean it that way. I was just repeating the way that I</p>
<p>heard the story. But something that touches me equally</p>
<p>ferociously is this idea of like the little guy getting run over</p>
<p>by some like, you know, objective thing over here that</p>
<p>makes a decision that&rsquo;s arbitrary.</p>
<p>I 100% agree with you.</p>
<p>And so like the idea that like, you know, somebody who&rsquo;s on an</p>
<p>app, all of a sudden gets censored. Somebody that, you</p>
<p>know, makes a post gets canceled. Somebody that all</p>
<p>tries to make a trade can&rsquo;t, it feels unfair. It feels that each</p>
<p>individual is suffering some pretty deep inequity. Yes. And I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t, I just can&rsquo;t stand that it really just touches me in a</p>
<p>way that tilts me.</p>
<p>And I get very, and you know what, it&rsquo;s interesting. I think</p>
<p>the reason I made the Robin Hood investment is because my</p>
<p>belief in the underdog and my belief in people&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>come up from being poor or middle class to middle class or</p>
<p>affluent Friedberg, you haven&rsquo;t chimed in yet, as we wrap here</p>
<p>and then move on to our second topic, I think we&rsquo;re at an hour.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, um, so I just want to say, you know, we talked about</p>
<p>decentralization. And, you know, we all feel the emotional</p>
<p>response to the little guy getting screwed by the big guy</p>
<p>that controls the system. And we want to fight the system. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the basis of every great movie. That it&rsquo;s worth highlighting,</p>
<p>though, that decentralization, and what I would kind of</p>
<p>characterize as swarming behavior, uncontrolled swarming</p>
<p>behavior can actually have negative consequences. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason systems exist. You know, when you put a bunch</p>
<p>of people in a room, let&rsquo;s say you put 100 people in a room,</p>
<p>and every time and someone says the word door, and every time</p>
<p>you hear the word door, you&rsquo;re supposed to repeat it. Within 30</p>
<p>seconds, the entire room will be like deafening with everyone</p>
<p>screaming door, door, door, and suddenly everyone will be</p>
<p>screaming it. That&rsquo;s a feedback loop that occurs in an</p>
<p>uncontrolled social system. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s occurred with</p>
<p>GameStop. And it&rsquo;s what occurred with with with Bitcoin. So there</p>
<p>are, as we&rsquo;ve seen, remarkable outcomes when you allow systems</p>
<p>to operate without centralized control, and without</p>
<p>centralized brake pads, that kind of slow them down or put in</p>
<p>place some rules and some obligations to how that system</p>
<p>operates. The problem with decentralization, and this</p>
<p>swarming approach to resolution, where lots of people basically</p>
<p>work together individually, is you end up with things like</p>
<p>cancel culture, where before a judge and jury determines</p>
<p>whether or not someone did something wrong, the community</p>
<p>decides that person should be punished and shuts them down in</p>
<p>the real world and their career and their life is ended and</p>
<p>ruined. And we saw the same. And we saw the same with the capital</p>
<p>riots, you know, people basically died, because of the</p>
<p>swarm that occurred, where this idea that there was fraud in the</p>
<p>election became an echoing, deafening noise for these</p>
<p>people, and they swarmed and killed people. And the system by</p>
<p>which you can actually have vigorous debate, and the system</p>
<p>by which you can actually have controls and processes and</p>
<p>judges and juries and trials is what needs to be improved for</p>
<p>this to work. Otherwise, people will go to decentralization and</p>
<p>you will have a Lord of the Flies moment that engulfs civil</p>
<p>society, because the tools are there today. And so centralized</p>
<p>systems can work, but they have to adapt and adapt quickly to be</p>
<p>fair and to enable and to not discriminate. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see Lord of the Flies and we&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>decentralization being the solution to getting out of the</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s inhibiting us, and we&rsquo;re going to end up having</p>
<p>really fucking ugly outcomes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a psychological term for what you&rsquo;re describing. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>diffusion of responsibility, when and also known as mob</p>
<p>behavior, when a group of people collectively do something, their</p>
<p>individual morality can evaporate. And the larger the</p>
<p>group and the more intense the behavior, the less</p>
<p>responsibility each person takes for it. So five people on the</p>
<p>steps of the Capitol, you know, one person breaks a window,</p>
<p>maybe somebody breaks it. But once you have 500 or 5000, and</p>
<p>one person breaks a window, now you got a much higher percentage</p>
<p>of people start breaking windows. And that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>tragedies happen. Of course, World War Two was the diffusion</p>
<p>of responsibility.</p>
<p>We agree. Yeah, you&rsquo;re totally right. You&rsquo;re totally just one</p>
<p>quick point, and then we can just move on. Yeah. So I think</p>
<p>these like viral tools, these social networks, they enable two</p>
<p>things, they enable mobs, but they also enable movements. I</p>
<p>think the mobs are bad, and the movements are good, or they can</p>
<p>be good depending on what their manifesto and what their mission</p>
<p>is. And so I think we want to enable the movements, but we</p>
<p>want to be really careful about the mobs. And you know, one of</p>
<p>the things that&rsquo;s kind of disturbing about Twitter is, I</p>
<p>generally find that like the tweets that seem to go the most</p>
<p>viral are the ones that are full of rage and anger. And the ones</p>
<p>that are trying to make more nuanced points just kind of get</p>
<p>lost. And so there is something a little bit disturbing about</p>
<p>the mob behavior. But the movement, the enabling of these</p>
<p>new movements, I think is really powerful. And that&rsquo;s what Wall</p>
<p>Street Bets was, at least in the early stage, and they did not</p>
<p>deserve to get shut down like that.</p>
<p>Social networks are a collective amygdala. They are not a</p>
<p>collective cerebral cortex. And I think if someone can solve that</p>
<p>problem and get people to think about the rational objective</p>
<p>outcomes in a social way, in as engaging a fashion as it is to</p>
<p>kind of be excited by the negative shit that excites the</p>
<p>amygdala, you know, it could be really powerful. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably we&rsquo;re going to need politicians who are going to</p>
<p>need some level of politician who has some integrity and some</p>
<p>expertise.</p>
<p>Only.</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t you think don&rsquo;t you think politicians with making a</p>
<p>transition ideas? I was gonna say don&rsquo;t you guys think that</p>
<p>what this means is that entrepreneurs now can really</p>
<p>think about decentralization as the key feature, like in many of</p>
<p>these markets or these systems, where we have the centralized</p>
<p>authority, we have to move to a much more decentralized,</p>
<p>democratized way of doing things, whether it&rsquo;s stock</p>
<p>trading, or whether it&rsquo;s healthcare records, or whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, education systems and degrees and</p>
<p>accreditation, there has to be a way where you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>canceled.</p>
<p>Yeah, but with morally and ethically inclined and or</p>
<p>legally inclined systems that ensure that the behavior of that</p>
<p>system doesn&rsquo;t run amok. And, you know, that&rsquo;s really where</p>
<p>things can, can go can go awry, as we&rsquo;ve seen lately. But it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hard problem to solve it. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna solve it</p>
<p>here today.</p>
<p>Just a final update. I don&rsquo;t know if this is exactly</p>
<p>correct. But I just asked on Twitter, how many shares of Game</p>
<p>Stop are still short. Apparently, there&rsquo;s still 55</p>
<p>million shares are so short of the 70 million or so share total</p>
<p>shares and 47 million in the float. So something very bad</p>
<p>could still happen here. I mean, these shorts have not been</p>
<p>covered. So this is going to be an ongoing saga where I think</p>
<p>every single platform if if consumers keep buying the shares,</p>
<p>what is the end? Does anybody have an idea or a prediction on</p>
<p>the end game here? And then we&rsquo;ll move on? What is the end</p>
<p>game? If another 5 million people buy the shares or 10</p>
<p>million people buy it, and it goes to 1000? Or 2000? What</p>
<p>happens if GameStop is worth $100 billion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question. Well, can I tell you, Jason, what that</p>
<p>means? There&rsquo;s a great article in the information which Sam</p>
<p>lesson wrote, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys read it. But it</p>
<p>basically said, Why did Tesla win? Now, this is not accurate.</p>
<p>But I think his framing is relatively accurate, which is</p>
<p>people were buying Elon like they would buy a trading card.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And, and Tesla is a manifestation of Elon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And it actually is. So visually, it makes a ton</p>
<p>of sense to me, like, then I think, you know, why have like</p>
<p>Richard Branson&rsquo;s businesses worked? Or why is the Jordan</p>
<p>brand work or come off all the, you know, at a smaller level?</p>
<p>Yeah, at a smaller level, because we&rsquo;re brands, and we</p>
<p>have these values, and people can imbue their, their</p>
<p>collective decision making and support to the person versus the</p>
<p>institution. It&rsquo;s a belief. It&rsquo;s a belief in what that person</p>
<p>represents to, you know, I can, why did MBS buy that friggin</p>
<p>painting that wasn&rsquo;t even a Leonardo painting for a billion</p>
<p>dollars? You know, there was some belief there, you know, is</p>
<p>it really worth a billion dollars? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. At</p>
<p>the end of the day, most assets are most assets are purchased</p>
<p>under the premise that I believe the price will be higher</p>
<p>tomorrow than it is today. And if we all believe that, then we</p>
<p>will all buy it today. And we will all find more people buying</p>
<p>tomorrow. That&rsquo;s what Bitcoin is. Do we all agree though, that</p>
<p>GameStop is not Tesla? I don&rsquo;t agree with your premise. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that stocks necessarily need to be reflective of the</p>
<p>underlying business. And that&rsquo;s what so what but but no, just</p>
<p>think about it. It&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so shocking about this</p>
<p>week. Because we&rsquo;ve all been taught in these friggin economics</p>
<p>books and these financial analysis books. Oh, the stock is</p>
<p>worth x dollars, this kind of cash flow, what company has ever</p>
<p>paid out dividends that equal the amount that you paid to buy</p>
<p>the friggin stock unless you lived in 1926. It hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happened. So everything we&rsquo;ve been taught about DCFs and</p>
<p>future cash flows and everything is nonsense. At the end of the</p>
<p>day, every stock trades based on the assumption that someone will</p>
<p>pay more for it than I am paying for it today. That is it. That</p>
<p>is entirely what a stock is. And so if everyone&rsquo;s belief is</p>
<p>completely uncoupled from the underlying asset that that stock</p>
<p>is meant to represent, it doesn&rsquo;t friggin matter. And it</p>
<p>highlights what&rsquo;s really going on. Trading stocks is not</p>
<p>investing in businesses. And I say, yeah, can I say something</p>
<p>else on top of this, Jason, what was the name of the member when</p>
<p>we were talking about censorship? What was the name of</p>
<p>the the left podcast that got cancelled on Twitter? Red, red</p>
<p>scare, red scare. Is GameStop red scare or at the real Donald</p>
<p>Trump? And my point is, who the hell are we to decide? Right?</p>
<p>How does it all three got cancelled? All three got</p>
<p>cancelled. What&rsquo;s your prediction? We&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>a year from now full year out. What does GameStop January 2022</p>
<p>look like? What is the stock price look like? What is the</p>
<p>business look like? What How does this all resolve itself?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a public stock market trader. I&rsquo;m just not I</p>
<p>just feel like it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not a day trader. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>public stocks. It&rsquo;s just kind of like, to me, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>distraction. What do you know this end? I you know, just buy</p>
<p>Vanguard funds. Like guys, if you&rsquo;re listening to this</p>
<p>program, and you&rsquo;re wondering where to put your money, just</p>
<p>buy Vanguard funds and stop worrying about it.</p>
<p>Index low fees index. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you want to</p>
<p>bet specific companies, because you get enjoyment out of it, do</p>
<p>it. But yeah, okay. So nobody has any idea what happens if it</p>
<p>hits 100 billion or how this adds. So I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illustrative of my point is that for somewhat intelligent people</p>
<p>who have some degree of expertise in this area, we have</p>
<p>no idea how this ends. But this is a black swan. But this is the</p>
<p>point it is a it is a collective Ouija board moment,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s got their hand on the Ouija board, and they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to craft the sentence. Any one of us individually cannot</p>
<p>predict what a collective group of 3 million plus people are</p>
<p>going to do. And we&rsquo;ve, you know, we try and struggle and</p>
<p>think about the underlying value of a business, which is what</p>
<p>these hedge funds have done historically. But at the end of</p>
<p>the day, this thing is going to be worth what the market tells</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s worth and what the market chooses to do. We</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t know because we are not the collective 3 million.</p>
<p>Jason, yeah, yeah. So look, Jason, there&rsquo;s two questions,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s always this question of like, what should</p>
<p>the price be? And then who gets to decide? And you look, do I</p>
<p>personally think GameStop is overvalued? Yes, of course. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to end very badly. But the question is, who</p>
<p>gets to decide? And is the game can be rigged by powerful</p>
<p>insiders against outsiders? Just it&rsquo;s just like the same</p>
<p>question with parlor, okay? Which is who gets it&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>which, look, we can say that there&rsquo;s certain views that are</p>
<p>bad, okay? But the question is, who gets the power to decide</p>
<p>that? And it&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s the thing we have to ask</p>
<p>is that second order question of who has the power to decide? Is</p>
<p>there any outcome is on got to decide and Robin Hood got to</p>
<p>decide and the victims were parlor and GameStop.</p>
<p>100%. Okay, so this would be a good segue to move on.</p>
<p>Apparently, we had a discussion on the last episode about</p>
<p>running for governor. And I bought the domain name</p>
<p>governor chamath.com I had governor jason.com I got</p>
<p>governor sacks and governor Friedberg calm and I redirected</p>
<p>him and you guys own them and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re redirected to</p>
<p>your Twitter handles. And lo and behold, we wake up one day and</p>
<p>chamath for CA is live. Chamath everybody wants to know jump the</p>
<p>gun we were gonna have a vigorous debate and decide</p>
<p>which one. Yeah, who&rsquo;s gonna run but somebody jumped in. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying other might not jump in other besties could jump in</p>
<p>to have domains. Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Jason, we do not</p>
<p>want to split the bestie vote. I think we got this is this is the</p>
<p>four musketeers. We&rsquo;re all behind him off. Now we do not</p>
<p>want to split the bestie vote. Okay, it&rsquo;s on you. Tell us</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen now. What&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>We are going to do an emergency pod and talk about exactly that.</p>
<p>So if folks want to know they&rsquo;re gonna have to tune in midweek,</p>
<p>but maybe we have to do right now. Well, let&rsquo;s talk about the</p>
<p>web. It&rsquo;s coming up with it. Well, we&rsquo;ll wrap on this the</p>
<p>website. You put out a platform. What&rsquo;s the action been? And no,</p>
<p>these reactions in part? Guys, midweek, I want to be I want to</p>
<p>be very clear midweek midweek, but I&rsquo;ll just say this. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be very clear. I&rsquo;m gonna be very clear. I&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>guys, midweek, I want to be I want to be very clear midweek</p>
<p>midweek, but I&rsquo;ll just tell the quick story is three young</p>
<p>people. These three amazing guys just built they built it. And I</p>
<p>just retweeted it. I can say the 10s of 1000s of people have</p>
<p>signed up for updates. I know that much. All these three guys</p>
<p>though. Here&rsquo;s the can I just if I can tell a shout out to these</p>
<p>guys. Rahul Samir and Aman all these three guys. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>live in California. Two did, but had to leave. One wants to</p>
<p>move but can&rsquo;t because he can&rsquo;t afford it. And it&rsquo;s just such a</p>
<p>microcosm of like how beautiful California is a place is and</p>
<p>just what people think about when they think about the state</p>
<p>is just so it&rsquo;s so lovely. So for another time, but anyway,</p>
<p>shout out to those guys for building the website. Thank you.</p>
<p>So essentially, the entire market has now been driven by a</p>
<p>group of all in of the all in army built a website, you</p>
<p>retweeted it. And that&rsquo;s what this is all about. So there has</p>
<p>been no paperwork filed, there is no action committee. However,</p>
<p>it has traction. So it makes one and you know, I mean, there may</p>
<p>be a shadow cabinet meeting, maybe not. There may or may not</p>
<p>be. But there may be a shadow cabinet meeting. What is the</p>
<p>chances?</p>
<p>Well, I think Chamath by publishing that website just</p>
<p>went down the escalator.</p>
<p>Golden escalator, he&rsquo;s gone down the escalator. And who knows</p>
<p>what could happen now? I&rsquo;ll tell you this. I went on. I&rsquo;ll do a</p>
<p>plug. I went on Bloomberg amazing, amazing hit. Great</p>
<p>amazing hit. It&rsquo;s on YouTube. We can put the show notes. Yeah,</p>
<p>but put the link in the show notes, Nick, people need to</p>
<p>watch that I went through all the ways in which California is</p>
<p>hurting. Newsom hasn&rsquo;t done a very good job. And I made my</p>
<p>case for Chamath. So that&rsquo;s a prelude to what we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>on the next pod. But that the amazing thing is the outpouring.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of people who have texted me, emailed me and</p>
<p>Chamath and all of us, like there&rsquo;s a groundswell happening</p>
<p>now. 100%. So you know, I would say all the fans of the pod who</p>
<p>are now behind this, you guys are making it real.</p>
<p>Freedberg, Manifest Destiny here. What&rsquo;s going on? Is this</p>
<p>another wisdom of the crowds or a mob or a movement?</p>
<p>Who am I to say?</p>
<p>Are you? Are you in as chief science officer? Will you be our</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci?</p>
<p>You know, here, I think we should have a good debate on our</p>
<p>next pod and hear the platform and discuss the platform and,</p>
<p>you know, make sure that we all feel like this is this is where</p>
<p>we should be. And I think this is going to take a little bit of</p>
<p>time to to build. And I think, you know, the more we kind of</p>
<p>build towards it, the more likely we are to have that</p>
<p>groundswell that we&rsquo;re going to need.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s give the oil and let&rsquo;s give you all I will tell</p>
<p>you, it seems pretty likely that this recall effort is going to</p>
<p>get the signatures it needs. So we can kind of put that in the</p>
<p>sand that it&rsquo;s very likely we&rsquo;re going to end up seeing a recall</p>
<p>election.</p>
<p>Okay, so if people want to participate in recall Gavin</p>
<p>Newsom, what do they do? Because that is the first step?</p>
<p>Yes, towards Chamath governorship,</p>
<p>you got to go, you got to go to rescue California.org. Rescue</p>
<p>California.org. Go to that website, sign the petition. That</p>
<p>is the first step. We are very, we only need a few 100,000 more</p>
<p>signatures. We have 1.2 million, we need 1.5 million, go there,</p>
<p>sign up and then go to Chamath&rsquo;s website, which is Chamath for</p>
<p>ca.com.</p>
<p>And so, Jason, I&rsquo;ll make one more point. And I think, and I</p>
<p>made this the other day on that clubhouse that Saxon I did, I</p>
<p>think we made it before you joined. If you think about the</p>
<p>difference between a leader and a manager, a manager is someone</p>
<p>who typically delegates responsibility and authority. A</p>
<p>leader is effective at synthesizing multiple people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>points of view, and creates an opportunity defines a vision</p>
<p>defines an objective that is the synthesis of all the people</p>
<p>that that report to him. And, and for which for whom he is</p>
<p>responsible, or she. And I think what we&rsquo;ve seen in California in</p>
<p>particular, and really across leadership positions or governing</p>
<p>positions across the country during this pandemic, is a</p>
<p>failure of leadership. Because when times are predictable, if A</p>
<p>then B, it is easy to manage and it is easy to look successful. I</p>
<p>delegate down to the person who knows best and they are</p>
<p>responsible for the outcome and they do it well, great, all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing is pointing to the right person to run something. The</p>
<p>pandemic is difficult, and it is unpredictable. It requires the</p>
<p>synthesis of economic information, social information</p>
<p>and health information. And more often than not, a person who</p>
<p>typically acts like a manager points to the person they think</p>
<p>should be in charge under the circumstance to make a decision.</p>
<p>And that person is not equipped to synthesize the economic and</p>
<p>social ramifications of the decision. So what we have seen</p>
<p>during the pandemic is most often people in a governing</p>
<p>position have pointed to the health officer or the medical</p>
<p>person and said, you make the decision. And that person does</p>
<p>not necessarily account for the social and economic</p>
<p>ramifications of the decision they&rsquo;re making. A health person</p>
<p>knows how to save lives. The best way to save lives is shut</p>
<p>everything down. And so the test of leadership during this</p>
<p>pandemic has been a test of synthesis, and recommending an</p>
<p>action that&rsquo;s associated with the understanding of the social,</p>
<p>economic and health implications of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really where so many governing bodies and individuals</p>
<p>have fallen apart during this pandemic is an inability to do</p>
<p>that effectively. And I think that is what is needed going</p>
<p>forward. It is a it is a moment of test. It is a it is a moment</p>
<p>of truth about about the difference between a manager and</p>
<p>a leader. And we&rsquo;re seeing across the nation, who is what,</p>
<p>and I think it is highlighting why some folks may not be best</p>
<p>suited to do this. The second thing I&rsquo;ll say and I know I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>a little bit of a diatribe. But the second thing I&rsquo;ll say is</p>
<p>career.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been waiting for your diatribe. By the way, it took 19</p>
<p>episodes go</p>
<p>career, career politicians, I think simply should not exist.</p>
<p>If you go back to the origins of this country, right, having your</p>
<p>place in government, and we talked about this over email,</p>
<p>having your place in government was meant to be something that</p>
<p>everyone was supposed to take their turn doing. And the people</p>
<p>that were sitting in political seats, it was supposed to be the</p>
<p>merchant and the local farmer and the banker and we were all</p>
<p>supposed to take our turn representing our communities</p>
<p>representing our people in government. And what we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is people who have made a career out of being a politician. And</p>
<p>the result of that is that their job depends on them getting</p>
<p>reelected. In order to remain in their career, they have to get</p>
<p>reelected. And they ultimately end up making trade offs that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily represent the best long term interest of their</p>
<p>community. And this is broadly true across nations across</p>
<p>centuries. But it&rsquo;s particularly acute in the United States where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen such wealth creation over the last 250 years. And</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened is when you have career politicians sitting in</p>
<p>these seats for so long in an environment of severe wealth</p>
<p>creation, you end up having governments that are ineffective</p>
<p>and creating systems that fail us. And here we are. And what we</p>
<p>need is to have someone go in that&rsquo;s not dependent on the</p>
<p>traditional folks that get people elected and fund</p>
<p>elections and result in reelections. We need someone</p>
<p>that can go in as an outsider and make a change. And so my</p>
<p>advocacy for what&rsquo;s needed in California, and I think</p>
<p>nationally, and that&rsquo;s a longer conversation is to find those</p>
<p>types of folks to come in and lead and be politicians that can</p>
<p>take a leadership role, synthesize information and not</p>
<p>be worried about the reelection cycle and not have anything to</p>
<p>lose related to a career in politics. So on on that note, I</p>
<p>want to say I love all of you. And let&rsquo;s do our emergency pod</p>
<p>on Tuesday. Do you guys want to play poker tonight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a child. I was playing that original graduation. My</p>
<p>mom&rsquo;s in town. My parents got vaccinated. Yeah, I can play. I</p>
<p>can. Oh, here we go. Maybe a little guys that wants to play.</p>
<p>He just</p>
<p>one note, if you do fill out if you take if you go to rescue</p>
<p>california.org. Is that the name sex? Yes. If you go there, you</p>
<p>print out the petition, and you hold it up and take a selfie</p>
<p>with your signature on it. And you add the besties we will like</p>
<p>it, possibly retweet it and possibly follow you. So go and</p>
<p>take a picture of your printout with your name on it. And that</p>
<p>proves that you&rsquo;re part of the all in army, and we will like</p>
<p>it. We might follow you and we might even retweet you. You</p>
<p>could fall besties love you. And we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on</p>
<p>the all in pocket.</p>
<p>See a couple&rsquo;s therapy tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the all in park.</p>
<p>A billion here a billion there pretty soon you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>real money.</p>
<p>I love you, sex.</p>
<p>These are really big numbers.</p>
<p>This spread the opportunity that that technology represents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably gonna have four Kardashians on there.</p>
