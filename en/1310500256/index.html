    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Elon Musk,</p>
<p>his third time on this, The Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>No, wow, okay.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do the headphone thing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, how close do I need to get up to the same place?</p>
<p>The closer you are, the sexier you sound.</p>
<p>Hey, babe.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get enough of your love, baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna clip that out</p>
<p>any time somebody messages me about it.</p>
<p>If you want my body and you think I&rsquo;m sexy,</p>
<p>come right out and tell me so.</p>
<p>Do, do, do, do, do.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Okay, serious mode activate.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Serious mode.</p>
<p>Come on, you&rsquo;re Russian.</p>
<p>You can be serious.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s serious all the time in Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten soft.</p>
<p>Allow me to say that the SpaceX launch</p>
<p>of human beings to orbit on May 30th, 2020</p>
<p>was seen by many as the first step</p>
<p>in a new era of human space exploration.</p>
<p>These human space flight missions were a beacon of hope</p>
<p>to me and to millions over the past two years</p>
<p>as our world has been going through</p>
<p>one of the most difficult periods in recent human history.</p>
<p>We saw, we see the rise of division, fear, cynicism,</p>
<p>and the loss of common humanity</p>
<p>right when it is needed most.</p>
<p>So first, Elon, let me say thank you</p>
<p>for giving the world hope and reason</p>
<p>to be excited about the future.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s kind of easy to say.</p>
<p>I do want to do that.</p>
<p>Humanity has obviously a lot of issues</p>
<p>and people at times do bad things,</p>
<p>but despite all that, I love humanity</p>
<p>and I think we should make sure we do everything we can</p>
<p>to have a good future and an exciting future</p>
<p>and one where that maximizes the happiness of the people.</p>
<p>Let me ask about Crew Dragon Demo 2.</p>
<p>So that first flight with humans on board,</p>
<p>how did you feel leading up to that launch?</p>
<p>Were you scared?</p>
<p>Were you excited?</p>
<p>What was going through your mind?</p>
<p>So much was at stake.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful, no question.</p>
<p>We obviously could not let them down in any way.</p>
<p>So extremely stressful, I&rsquo;d say, to say the least.</p>
<p>I was confident that at the time that we launched</p>
<p>that no one could think of anything at all to do</p>
<p>that would improve the probability of success.</p>
<p>And we racked our brains to think of any possible way</p>
<p>to improve the probability of success.</p>
<p>We could not think of anything more, nor could NASA.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just the best that we could do.</p>
<p>So then we went ahead and launched.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not a religious person,</p>
<p>but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed for that mission.</p>
<p>Were you able to sleep?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How did it feel when it was a success,</p>
<p>first when the launch was a success,</p>
<p>and when they returned back home or back to Earth?</p>
<p>It was a great relief.</p>
<p>Yeah, for high stress situations,</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s not so much elation as relief.</p>
<p>And I think once, as we got more comfortable</p>
<p>and proved out the systems,</p>
<p>because we really got to make sure everything works,</p>
<p>it was definitely a lot more enjoyable</p>
<p>with the subsequent astronaut missions.</p>
<p>And I thought the Inspiration mission</p>
<p>was actually a very inspiring Inspiration 4 mission.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d encourage people to watch the Inspiration documentary</p>
<p>on Netflix, it&rsquo;s actually really good.</p>
<p>And it really isn&rsquo;t, I was actually inspired by that.</p>
<p>And so that one I felt I was kind of able</p>
<p>to enjoy the actual mission</p>
<p>and not just be super stressed all the time.</p>
<p>So for people that somehow don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the all civilian, first time all civilian</p>
<p>out to space, out to orbit.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was I think the highest orbit</p>
<p>that in like, I don&rsquo;t know, 30 or 40 years or something.</p>
<p>The only one that was higher was the one shuttle,</p>
<p>sorry, a Hubble servicing mission.</p>
<p>And then before that, it would have been Apollo in 72.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty wild.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I think as a species, we want to be continuing</p>
<p>to do better and reach higher ground.</p>
<p>And like, I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic</p>
<p>if Apollo was the high watermark for humanity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s as far as we ever got.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s concerning that here we are 49 years</p>
<p>after the last mission to the moon.</p>
<p>And so almost half a century, and we&rsquo;ve not been back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s worrying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, does that mean we&rsquo;ve peaked as a civilization</p>
<p>or what?</p>
<p>So like, I think we got to get back to the moon</p>
<p>and build a base there, a science base.</p>
<p>I think we could learn a lot about the nature</p>
<p>of the universe if we have a proper science base</p>
<p>on the moon, like we have a science base in Antarctica</p>
<p>and many other parts of the world.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s like, I think the next big thing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to have like a serious moon base</p>
<p>and then get people to Mars and get out there</p>
<p>and be a spacefaring civilization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you about some of those details,</p>
<p>but since you&rsquo;re so busy with the hard engineering</p>
<p>challenges of everything that&rsquo;s involved,</p>
<p>are you still able to marvel at the magic of it all,</p>
<p>of space travel, of every time the rocket goes up,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s a crewed mission?</p>
<p>Or are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges</p>
<p>that you have to solve?</p>
<p>And actually, sort of to add to that,</p>
<p>the reason I wanted to ask this question of May 30th,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been some time, so you can look back</p>
<p>and think about the impact already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already, at the time it was an engineering problem</p>
<p>maybe, now it&rsquo;s becoming a historic moment.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a moment that, how many moments</p>
<p>will be remembered about the 21st century?</p>
<p>To me, that or something like that,</p>
<p>maybe Inspiration4, one of those would be remembered</p>
<p>as the early steps of a new age of space exploration.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, during the launches itself,</p>
<p>so I mean, I think maybe some people will know,</p>
<p>but a lot of people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>is like I&rsquo;m actually the chief engineer of SpaceX,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve signed off on pretty much all the design decisions.</p>
<p>And so if there&rsquo;s something that goes wrong</p>
<p>with that vehicle, it&rsquo;s fundamentally my fault, so.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really just thinking about all the things that,</p>
<p>like, so when I see the rocket,</p>
<p>I see all the things that could go wrong</p>
<p>and the things that could be better</p>
<p>and the same with the Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, other people will see,</p>
<p>oh, this is a spacecraft or a rocket</p>
<p>and this looks really cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve like a readout of like,</p>
<p>these are the risks, these are the problems,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>Like, choo choo choo choo choo choo choo.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not what other people see</p>
<p>when they see the product, you know.</p>
<p>So let me ask you then to analyze Starship</p>
<p>in that same way.</p>
<p>I know you have, you&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>in more detail about Starship in the near future, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can talk about it now if you want.</p>
<p>But just in that same way, like you said,</p>
<p>you see, when you see a rocket,</p>
<p>you see sort of a list of risks.</p>
<p>In that same way, you said that Starship</p>
<p>is a really hard problem.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many ways I can ask this,</p>
<p>but if you magically could solve one problem perfectly,</p>
<p>one engineering problem perfectly,</p>
<p>which one would it be?</p>
<p>On Starship?</p>
<p>On, sorry, on Starship.</p>
<p>So is it maybe related to the efficiency,</p>
<p>the engine, the weight of the different components,</p>
<p>the complexity of various things,</p>
<p>maybe the controls of the crazy thing it has to do to land?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually by far the biggest thing</p>
<p>absorbing my time is engine production.</p>
<p>Not the design of the engine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve often said prototypes are easy, production is hard.</p>
<p>So we have the most advanced rocket engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been designed.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;d say currently the best rocket engine ever</p>
<p>is probably the RD180 or RD170,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Russian engine basically.</p>
<p>And still, I think an engine should only count</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gotten something to orbit.</p>
<p>So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet,</p>
<p>but it is, it&rsquo;s the first engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually better than the Russian RD engines,</p>
<p>which were amazing design.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about Raptor engine.</p>
<p>What makes it amazing?</p>
<p>What are the different aspects of it that make it,</p>
<p>like what are you the most excited about</p>
<p>if the whole thing works in terms of efficiency,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, the Raptor is a full flow</p>
<p>staged combustion engine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s operating at a very high chamber pressure.</p>
<p>So one of the key figures of merit, perhaps the key figure</p>
<p>of merit is what is the chamber pressure</p>
<p>at which the rocket engine can operate?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the combustion chamber pressure.</p>
<p>So Raptor is designed to operate at 300 bar,</p>
<p>possibly maybe higher, that&rsquo;s 300 atmospheres.</p>
<p>So the record right now for operational engine</p>
<p>is the RD engine that I mentioned, the Russian RD,</p>
<p>which is I believe around 267 bar.</p>
<p>And the difficulty of the chamber pressure</p>
<p>is increases on a nonlinear basis.</p>
<p>So 10% more chamber pressure is more like 50% more difficult.</p>
<p>But that chamber pressure is,</p>
<p>that is what allows you to get a very high power density</p>
<p>for the engine.</p>
<p>So enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio</p>
<p>and a very high specific impulse.</p>
<p>So specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency</p>
<p>of a rocket engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the effect of exhaust velocity</p>
<p>of the gas coming out of the engine.</p>
<p>So with a very high chamber pressure,</p>
<p>you can have a compact engine</p>
<p>that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio,</p>
<p>which is the ratio between the exit nozzle and the throat.</p>
<p>So you see a rocket engine&rsquo;s got sort of like a hourglass</p>
<p>shape, it&rsquo;s like a chamber and then it necks down</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a nozzle and the ratio of the exit diameter</p>
<p>to the throat is the expansion ratio.</p>
<p>So why is it such a hard engine to manufacture at scale?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complex.</p>
<p>So a lot of, what is complexity mean here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of components involved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of components and a lot of unique materials</p>
<p>that, so we had to invent several alloys</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t exist in order to make this engine work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a materials problem too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a materials problem and in a staged combustion,</p>
<p>a full flow staged combustion,</p>
<p>there are many feedback loops in the system.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;ve got propellants and hot gas</p>
<p>flowing simultaneously to so many different places</p>
<p>on the engine and they all have a recursive effect</p>
<p>on each other.</p>
<p>So you change one thing here, it has a recursive effect</p>
<p>here, it changes something over there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite hard to control.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a reason no one&rsquo;s made this before.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;re doing a staged combustion full flow</p>
<p>is because it has the highest possible efficiency.</p>
<p>So in order to make a fully reusable rocket,</p>
<p>which that&rsquo;s the really the holy grail of orbital rocketry.</p>
<p>You have to have, everything&rsquo;s gotta be the best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be the best engine, the best airframe,</p>
<p>the best heat shield, extremely light avionics,</p>
<p>very clever control mechanisms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to shed mass in any possible way that you can.</p>
<p>For example, we are, instead of putting landing legs</p>
<p>on the booster and ship, we are gonna catch them</p>
<p>with a tower to save the weight of the landing legs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about catching</p>
<p>the largest flying object ever made with,</p>
<p>on a giant tower with chopstick arms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Karate Kid with the fly, but much bigger.</p>
<p>I mean, pulling something like that home.</p>
<p>This probably won&rsquo;t work the first time.</p>
<p>Anyway, so this is bananas, this is banana stuff.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that you doubt, well, not you doubt,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s days or moments when you doubt</p>
<p>that this is even possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so difficult.</p>
<p>The possible part is, well, at this point,</p>
<p>I think we will get Starship to work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of timing.</p>
<p>How long will it take us to do this?</p>
<p>How long will it take us to actually achieve</p>
<p>full and rapid reusability?</p>
<p>Cause it will take probably many launches</p>
<p>before we are able to have full and rapid reusability.</p>
<p>But I can say that the physics pencils out.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not, like at this point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re confident that, like let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very confident success is in the set</p>
<p>of all possible outcomes.</p>
<p>For a while there, I was not convinced</p>
<p>that success was in the set of possible outcomes,</p>
<p>which is very important actually.</p>
<p>But so we&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s a chance, exactly.</p>
<p>Just not sure how long it will take.</p>
<p>We have a very talented team.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working night and day to make it happen.</p>
<p>And like I said, the critical thing to achieve</p>
<p>for the revolution in space flight</p>
<p>and for humanity to be a spacefaring civilization</p>
<p>is to have a fully and rapidly reusable rocket,</p>
<p>orbital rocket.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not even been any orbital rocket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been fully reusable ever.</p>
<p>And this has always been the holy grail of rocketry.</p>
<p>And many smart people, very smart people,</p>
<p>have tried to do this before and they&rsquo;ve not succeeded.</p>
<p>So, cause it&rsquo;s such a hard problem.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your source of belief in situations like this?</p>
<p>When the engineering problem is so difficult,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of experts, many of whom you admire,</p>
<p>who have failed in the past.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, a lot of experts,</p>
<p>maybe journalists, all the kind of,</p>
<p>the public in general have a lot of doubt</p>
<p>about whether it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And you yourself know that even if it&rsquo;s a non null set,</p>
<p>non empty set of success, it&rsquo;s still unlikely</p>
<p>or very difficult.</p>
<p>Like where do you go to, both personally,</p>
<p>intellectually as an engineer, as a team,</p>
<p>like for source of strength needed</p>
<p>to sort of persevere through this.</p>
<p>And to keep going with the project, take it to completion.</p>
<p>A source of strength.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really not how I think about things.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, it&rsquo;s simply this,</p>
<p>this is something that is important to get done</p>
<p>and we should just keep doing it or die trying.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t need a source of strength.</p>
<p>So quitting is not even like&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not in my nature.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care about optimism or pessimism.</p>
<p>Fuck that, we&rsquo;re gonna get it done.</p>
<p>Gonna get it done.</p>
<p>Can you then zoom back in to specific problems</p>
<p>with Starship or any engineering problems you work on?</p>
<p>Can you try to introspect your particular</p>
<p>biological neural network, your thinking process</p>
<p>and describe how you think through problems,</p>
<p>the different engineering and design problems?</p>
<p>Is there like a systematic process?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about first principles thinking,</p>
<p>but is there a kind of process to it?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, like saying like physics is a law</p>
<p>and everything else is a recommendation.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve met a lot of people that can break the law,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t met anyone who could break physics.</p>
<p>So the first, for any kind of technology problem,</p>
<p>you have to sort of just make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not violating physics.</p>
<p>And first principles analysis, I think,</p>
<p>is something that can be applied to really any walk of life,</p>
<p>anything really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just saying, let&rsquo;s boil something down</p>
<p>to the most fundamental principles.</p>
<p>The things that we are most confident are true</p>
<p>at a foundational level.</p>
<p>And that sets your axiomatic base,</p>
<p>and then you reason up from there,</p>
<p>and then you cross check your conclusion</p>
<p>against the axiomatic truths.</p>
<p>So some basics in physics would be like,</p>
<p>are you violating conservation of energy or momentum</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just to establish, is it possible?</p>
<p>And another good physics tool</p>
<p>is thinking about things in the limit.</p>
<p>If you take a particular thing</p>
<p>and you scale it to a very large number</p>
<p>or to a very small number, how do things change?</p>
<p>Both like in number of things you manufacture</p>
<p>or something like that, and then in time?</p>
<p>Yeah, like let&rsquo;s say take an example of like manufacturing,</p>
<p>which I think is just a very underrated problem.</p>
<p>And like I said, it&rsquo;s much harder to</p>
<p>take an advanced technology product</p>
<p>and bring it into volume manufacturing</p>
<p>than it is to design it in the first place.</p>
<p>My orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>is like why is this part or product expensive?</p>
<p>Is it because of something fundamentally foolish</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing or is it because our volume is too low?</p>
<p>And so then you say, okay, well, what if our volume</p>
<p>was a million units a year?</p>
<p>Is it still expensive?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by thinking about things in the limit.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s still expensive at a million units a year,</p>
<p>then volume is not the reason why your thing is expensive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something fundamental about the design.</p>
<p>And then you then can focus on reducing the complexity</p>
<p>or something like that in the design.</p>
<p>You gotta change the design to change the part</p>
<p>to be something that is not fundamentally expensive.</p>
<p>But like that&rsquo;s a common thing in rocketry</p>
<p>because the unit volume is relatively low.</p>
<p>And so a common excuse would be,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s expensive because our unit volume is low.</p>
<p>And if we were in like automotive or something like that,</p>
<p>or consumer electronics, then our costs would be lower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, so let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re making a million units a year.</p>
<p>Is it still expensive?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then economies of scale</p>
<p>are not the issue.</p>
<p>Do you throw into manufacturing,</p>
<p>do you throw like supply chain?</p>
<p>Talked about resources and materials and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Do you throw that into the calculation</p>
<p>of trying to reason from first principles,</p>
<p>like how we&rsquo;re gonna make the supply chain work here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then the cost of materials, things like that.</p>
<p>Or is that too much?</p>
<p>Exactly, so like a good example,</p>
<p>I think of thinking about things in the limit</p>
<p>is if you take any machine or whatever,</p>
<p>like take a rocket or whatever,</p>
<p>and say, if you look at the raw materials in the rocket,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have like aluminum, steel, titanium,</p>
<p>Inconel, specialty alloys, copper,</p>
<p>and you say, what&rsquo;s the weight of the constituent elements,</p>
<p>of each of these elements,</p>
<p>and what is their raw material value?</p>
<p>And that sets the asymptotic limit</p>
<p>for how low the cost of the vehicle can be</p>
<p>unless you change the materials.</p>
<p>So, and then when you do that,</p>
<p>I call it like maybe the magic one number</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So that would be like, if you had the,</p>
<p>like just a pile of these raw materials,</p>
<p>again, you could wave the magic wand</p>
<p>and rearrange the atoms into the final shape.</p>
<p>That would be the lowest possible cost</p>
<p>that you could make this thing for</p>
<p>unless you change the materials.</p>
<p>So then, and that is almost always a very low number.</p>
<p>So then what&rsquo;s actually causing things to be expensive</p>
<p>is how you put the atoms into the desired shape.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, if you don&rsquo;t mind me taking a tiny tangent,</p>
<p>I often talk to Jim Keller,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s somebody that worked with you as a friend.</p>
<p>Jim was, yeah, did great work at Tesla.</p>
<p>So I suppose he carries the flame</p>
<p>with the same kind of thinking</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about now.</p>
<p>And I guess I see that same thing</p>
<p>at Tesla and SpaceX folks who work there,</p>
<p>they kind of learn this way of thinking</p>
<p>and it kind of becomes obvious almost.</p>
<p>But anyway, I had argument, not argument,</p>
<p>but he educated me about how cheap it might be</p>
<p>to manufacture a Tesla bot.</p>
<p>We just, we had an argument.</p>
<p>How can you reduce the cost of scale of producing a robot?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to interact quite a bit,</p>
<p>obviously, in the academic circles with humanoid robots</p>
<p>and then Boston Dynamics and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very expensive to build.</p>
<p>And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like,</p>
<p>okay, like this kind of first principles thinking</p>
<p>of how can we get the cost of manufacturing down?</p>
<p>I suppose you do that,</p>
<p>you have done that kind of thinking for Tesla bot</p>
<p>and for all kinds of complex systems</p>
<p>that are traditionally seen as complex.</p>
<p>And you say, okay, how can we simplify everything down?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think if you are really good</p>
<p>at manufacturing, you can basically make,</p>
<p>at high volume, you can basically make anything</p>
<p>for a cost that asymptotically approaches</p>
<p>the raw material value of the constituents</p>
<p>plus any intellectual property that you need to do license.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like that&rsquo;s a very hard thing to do,</p>
<p>but it is possible for anything.</p>
<p>Anything in volume can be made, like I said,</p>
<p>for a cost that asymptotically approaches</p>
<p>this raw material constituents</p>
<p>plus intellectual property license rights.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;ll often happen in trying to design a product</p>
<p>is people will start with the tools and parts</p>
<p>and methods that they are familiar with</p>
<p>and then try to create the product</p>
<p>using their existing tools and methods.</p>
<p>The other way to think about it is actually imagine the,</p>
<p>try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect product</p>
<p>or technology, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>And say, what is the perfect arrangement of atoms</p>
<p>that would be the best possible product?</p>
<p>And now let us try to figure out</p>
<p>how to get the atoms in that shape.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a Rick and Morty absurd</p>
<p>until you start to really think about it</p>
<p>and you really should think about it in this way</p>
<p>because everything else is kind of,</p>
<p>if you think, you might fall victim to the momentum</p>
<p>of the way things were done in the past</p>
<p>unless you think in this way.</p>
<p>Well, just as a function of inertia,</p>
<p>people will want to use the same tools and methods</p>
<p>that they are familiar with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll do by default.</p>
<p>And then that will lead to an outcome of things</p>
<p>that can be made with those tools and methods</p>
<p>but is unlikely to be the platonic ideal</p>
<p>of the perfect product.</p>
<p>So then, so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to think of things</p>
<p>in both directions.</p>
<p>So like, what can we build with the tools that we have?</p>
<p>But then, but also what is the perfect,</p>
<p>the theoretical perfect product look like?</p>
<p>And that theoretical perfect part</p>
<p>is gonna be a moving target</p>
<p>because as you learn more,</p>
<p>the definition of that perfect product will change</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t actually know what the perfect product is,</p>
<p>but you can successfully approximate a more perfect product.</p>
<p>So think about it like that and then saying,</p>
<p>okay, now what tools, methods, materials,</p>
<p>whatever do we need to create</p>
<p>in order to get the atoms in that shape?</p>
<p>But people rarely think about it that way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a powerful tool.</p>
<p>I should mention that the brilliant Siobhan Ziles</p>
<p>is hanging out with us in case you hear a voice</p>
<p>of wisdom from outside, from up above.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me ask you about Mars.</p>
<p>You mentioned it would be great for science</p>
<p>to put a base on the moon to do some research.</p>
<p>But the truly big leap, again,</p>
<p>in this category of seemingly impossible,</p>
<p>is to put a human being on Mars.</p>
<p>When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?</p>
<p>Hmm, best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna ask you about Mars.</p>
<p>You mentioned it would be great for science</p>
<p>to put a base on the moon to do some research.</p>
<p>But the truly big leap, again,</p>
<p>in this category of seemingly impossible,</p>
<p>is to put a human being on Mars.</p>
<p>But the truly big leap, again,</p>
<p>in this category of seemingly impossible,</p>
<p>is to put a human being on Mars.</p>
<p>When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?</p>
<p>Hmm, best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.</p>
<p>What are the determining factors, would you say,</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective?</p>
<p>Or is that not the bottlenecks?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, order of magnitude or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot, it&rsquo;s really next level.</p>
<p>So, and the fundamental optimization of Starship</p>
<p>is minimizing cost per ton to orbit,</p>
<p>and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>This may seem like a mercantile objective,</p>
<p>but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized.</p>
<p>Like there is a certain cost per ton to the surface of Mars</p>
<p>where we can afford to establish a self sustaining city,</p>
<p>and then above that, we cannot afford to do it.</p>
<p>So right now, you couldn&rsquo;t fly to Mars for a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>No amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars.</p>
<p>So we need to get that above,</p>
<p>to get that something that is actually possible at all.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, we don&rsquo;t just want to have,</p>
<p>with Mars, flags and footprints,</p>
<p>and then not come back for a half century,</p>
<p>like we did with the Moon.</p>
<p>In order to pass a very important, great filter,</p>
<p>I think we need to be a multi planet species.</p>
<p>This may sound somewhat esoteric to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but eventually, given enough time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something, Earth is likely to experience</p>
<p>some calamity that could be something</p>
<p>that humans do to themselves,</p>
<p>or an external event like happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>But eventually, if none of that happens,</p>
<p>and somehow magically we keep going,</p>
<p>then the Sun is gradually expanding,</p>
<p>and will engulf the Earth,</p>
<p>and probably Earth gets too hot for life</p>
<p>in about 500 million years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time, but that&rsquo;s only 10% longer</p>
<p>than Earth has been around.</p>
<p>And so if you think about the current situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really remarkable, and kind of hard to believe,</p>
<p>but Earth&rsquo;s been around four and a half billion years,</p>
<p>and this is the first time in four and a half billion years</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been possible to extend life beyond Earth.</p>
<p>And that window of opportunity may be open</p>
<p>for a long time, and I hope it is,</p>
<p>but it also may be open for a short time.</p>
<p>And I think it is wise for us to act quickly</p>
<p>while the window is open, just in case it closes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the existence of nuclear weapons, pandemics,</p>
<p>all kinds of threats should kind of give us some motivation.</p>
<p>I mean, civilization could die with a bang or a whimper.</p>
<p>If it dies as a demographic collapse,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more of a whimper, obviously.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s World War III, it&rsquo;s more of a bang.</p>
<p>But these are all risks.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s important to think of these things</p>
<p>and just think of things like probabilities, not certainties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain probability</p>
<p>that something bad will happen on Earth.</p>
<p>I think most likely the future will be good.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s say for argument&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>a 1% chance per century of a civilization ending event.</p>
<p>Like that was Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s estimate.</p>
<p>I think he might be right about that.</p>
<p>So then we should basically think of this</p>
<p>being a multi planet species,</p>
<p>just like taking out a planet from the sky,</p>
<p>multi planet species, just like taking out insurance</p>
<p>for life itself.</p>
<p>Like life insurance for life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turned into an infomercial real quick.</p>
<p>Life insurance for life, yes.</p>
<p>And we can bring the creatures from,</p>
<p>plants and animals from Earth to Mars</p>
<p>and breathe life into the planet</p>
<p>and have a second planet with life.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t bring themselves there.</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t bring them to Mars,</p>
<p>then they will just for sure all die</p>
<p>when the sun expands anyway.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;ll be it.</p>
<p>What do you think is the most difficult aspect</p>
<p>of building a civilization on Mars?</p>
<p>Terraforming Mars, like from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>from a financial perspective, human perspective,</p>
<p>to get a large number of folks there</p>
<p>who will never return back to Earth?</p>
<p>No, they could certainly return.</p>
<p>Some will return back to Earth.</p>
<p>They will choose to stay there</p>
<p>for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, many will.</p>
<p>But we need the spaceships back,</p>
<p>like the ones that go to Mars.</p>
<p>We need them back.</p>
<p>So you can hop on if you want.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t just not have the spaceships come back.</p>
<p>Those things are expensive.</p>
<p>We need them back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to come back and do another trip.</p>
<p>I mean, do you think about the terraforming aspect,</p>
<p>like actually building?</p>
<p>Are you so focused right now on the spaceships part</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so critical to get to Mars?</p>
<p>We absolutely, if you can&rsquo;t get there,</p>
<p>nothing else matters.</p>
<p>So, and like I said, we can&rsquo;t get there</p>
<p>at some extraordinarily high cost.</p>
<p>I mean, the current cost of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>one ton to the surface of Mars</p>
<p>is on the order of a billion dollars.</p>
<p>So, because you don&rsquo;t just need the rocket</p>
<p>and the launch and everything,</p>
<p>you need like heat shield, you need guidance system,</p>
<p>you need deep space communications,</p>
<p>you need some kind of landing system.</p>
<p>So, like rough approximation would be a billion dollars</p>
<p>per ton to the surface of Mars right now.</p>
<p>This is obviously way too expensive</p>
<p>to create a self sustaining civilization.</p>
<p>So we need to improve that by at least a factor of 1,000.</p>
<p>A million per ton?</p>
<p>Yes, ideally much less than a million ton.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not, like it&rsquo;s gotta be,</p>
<p>so you have to say like, well,</p>
<p>how much can society afford to spend</p>
<p>or just want to spend on a self sustaining city on Mars?</p>
<p>The self sustaining part is important.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just the key threshold,</p>
<p>the great filter will have been passed</p>
<p>when the city on Mars can survive</p>
<p>even if the spaceships from Earth stop coming</p>
<p>for any reason, doesn&rsquo;t matter what the reason is,</p>
<p>but if they stop coming for any reason,</p>
<p>will it die out or will it not?</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s even one critical ingredient missing,</p>
<p>then it still doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, if you&rsquo;re on a long sea voyage</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got everything except vitamin C,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a matter of time, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna get a Mars city</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s self sustaining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure this will really happen in my lifetime,</p>
<p>but I hope to see it at least have a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>And then you could say, okay,</p>
<p>what is the minimum tonnage necessary</p>
<p>to have a self sustaining city?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty about this.</p>
<p>You could say like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably at least a million tons</p>
<p>cause you have to set up a lot of infrastructure on Mars.</p>
<p>Like I said, you can&rsquo;t be missing anything</p>
<p>that in order to be self sustaining,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be missing, like you need,</p>
<p>you know, semiconductor, fabs, you need iron ore refineries,</p>
<p>like you need lots of things, you know.</p>
<p>So, and Mars is not super hospitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the least inhospitable planet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely a fixer of a planet.</p>
<p>Outside of Earth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Earth is pretty good.</p>
<p>Earth is like easy, yeah.</p>
<p>And also I should, we should clarify in the solar system.</p>
<p>Yes, in the solar system.</p>
<p>There might be nice like vacation spots.</p>
<p>There might be some great planets out there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>Too hard to get there?</p>
<p>Yeah, way, way, way, way, way too hard to say the least.</p>
<p>Let me push back on that, not really a push back,</p>
<p>but a quick curve ball of a question.</p>
<p>So you did mention physics as the first starting point.</p>
<p>So, general relativity allows for wormholes.</p>
<p>They technically can exist.</p>
<p>Do you think those can ever be leveraged</p>
<p>by humans to travel fast in the speed of light?</p>
<p>Well, the wormhole thing is debatable.</p>
<p>The, we currently do not know of any means</p>
<p>of going faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>There is like, there are some ideas about having space.</p>
<p>Like so, you can only move at the speed of light</p>
<p>through space, but if you can make space itself move,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s warping space.</p>
<p>Space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like the universe in the Big Bang,</p>
<p>the universe expanded at much,</p>
<p>much more than the speed of light by a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but the, if this is possible,</p>
<p>the amount of energy required to warp space</p>
<p>is so gigantic, it boggles the mind.</p>
<p>So all the work you&rsquo;ve done with propulsion,</p>
<p>how much innovation is possible with rocket propulsion?</p>
<p>Is this, I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen it all,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re constantly innovating in every aspect.</p>
<p>How much is possible?</p>
<p>Like how much, can you get 10x somehow?</p>
<p>Is there something in there in physics</p>
<p>that you can get significant improvement</p>
<p>in terms of efficiency of engines</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, really the Holy Grail</p>
<p>is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital system.</p>
<p>So right now, the Falcon 9</p>
<p>is the only reusable rocket out there,</p>
<p>but the booster comes back and lands,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve seen the videos,</p>
<p>and we get the nose cone fairing back,</p>
<p>but we do not get the upper stage back.</p>
<p>So that means that we have a minimum cost</p>
<p>of building an upper stage.</p>
<p>And you can think of like a two stage rocket</p>
<p>of sort of like two airplanes,</p>
<p>like a big airplane and a small airplane.</p>
<p>And we get the big airplane back,</p>
<p>but not the small airplane.</p>
<p>And so it still costs a lot.</p>
<p>So that upper stage is at least $10 million.</p>
<p>And then the degree of,</p>
<p>the booster is not as rapidly and completely reusable</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;d like in order of the fairings.</p>
<p>So our kind of minimum marginal cost</p>
<p>and our counting overhead for per flight</p>
<p>is on the order of 15 to $20 million, maybe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s extremely good for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by far better than any rocket ever in history.</p>
<p>But with full and rapid reusability,</p>
<p>we can reduce the cost per ton to orbit</p>
<p>by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>But just think of it like,</p>
<p>like imagine if you had an aircraft or something or a car.</p>
<p>And if you had to buy a new car</p>
<p>every time you went for a drive,</p>
<p>that would be very expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be silly, frankly.</p>
<p>But in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car.</p>
<p>And that makes your trip like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a thousand times cheaper.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same for rockets.</p>
<p>If you, it&rsquo;s very difficult to make this complex machine</p>
<p>that can go to orbit.</p>
<p>And so if you cannot reuse it</p>
<p>and have to throw even any part of,</p>
<p>any significant part of it away,</p>
<p>that massively increases the cost.</p>
<p>So, you know, Starship in theory</p>
<p>could do a cost per launch of like a million,</p>
<p>maybe $2 million or something like that.</p>
<p>And put over a hundred tons in orbit, which is crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like it&rsquo;s by far the biggest bang</p>
<p>for the buck is to make it fully reusable</p>
<p>versus like some kind of brilliant breakthrough</p>
<p>in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>No, no, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no brilliant break.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no, just make the rocket reusable.</p>
<p>This is an extremely difficult engineering problem.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>No new physics is required.</p>
<p>Just brilliant engineering.</p>
<p>Let me ask a slightly philosophical fun question.</p>
<p>Gotta ask, I know you&rsquo;re focused on getting to Mars,</p>
<p>but once we&rsquo;re there on Mars, what do you,</p>
<p>what form of government, economic system, political system</p>
<p>do you think would work best</p>
<p>for an early civilization of humans?</p>
<p>Is, I mean, the interesting reason to talk about this stuff,</p>
<p>it also helps people dream about the future.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re really focused</p>
<p>about the short term engineering dream,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about imagining an actual civilization</p>
<p>on Mars that gives people, really gives people hope.</p>
<p>Well, it would be a new frontier and an opportunity</p>
<p>to rethink the whole nature of government,</p>
<p>just as was done in the creation of the United States.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I would suggest having a direct democracy,</p>
<p>people vote directly on things</p>
<p>as opposed to representative democracy.</p>
<p>So representative democracy, I think,</p>
<p>is too subject to a special interest</p>
<p>and a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d recommend that there was just direct democracy,</p>
<p>people vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves,</p>
<p>and then the laws must be short enough</p>
<p>that people can understand them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then like keeping a well informed populace,</p>
<p>like really being transparent about all the information,</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re voting for.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolute transparency.</p>
<p>Yeah, and not make it as annoying as those cookies</p>
<p>we have to accept. Accept cookies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always, like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like always like a slight amount of trepidation</p>
<p>when you click accept cookies,</p>
<p>like I feel as though there&rsquo;s like perhaps</p>
<p>like a very tiny chance that it&rsquo;ll open a portal to hell</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel.</p>
<p>Why do they, why do they keep wanting me to accept it?</p>
<p>What do they want with this cookie?</p>
<p>Like somebody got upset with accepting cookies</p>
<p>or something somewhere, who cares?</p>
<p>Like so annoying to keep accepting all these cookies.</p>
<p>To me, this is just a great example.</p>
<p>Yes, you can have my damn cookie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, whatever.</p>
<p>Heard it from Ilhan first.</p>
<p>He accepts all your damn cookies.</p>
<p>Yeah, and stop asking me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one example of implementation</p>
<p>of a good idea done really horribly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s somebody who was like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some good intentions of like privacy or whatever,</p>
<p>but now everyone&rsquo;s just has to accept cookies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not, you know, you have billions of people</p>
<p>who have to keep clicking accept cookie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super annoying.</p>
<p>Then we just accept the damn cookie, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There is like, I think a fundamental problem that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve not really had a major,</p>
<p>like a world war or something like that in a while.</p>
<p>And obviously we would like to not have world wars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not been a cleansing function</p>
<p>for rules and regulations.</p>
<p>So wars did have, you know, some sort of aligning</p>
<p>in that there would be a reset on rules</p>
<p>and regulations after a war.</p>
<p>So World Wars I and II,</p>
<p>there were huge resets on rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Now, if society does not have a war</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no cleansing function</p>
<p>or garbage collection for rules and regulations,</p>
<p>then rules and regulations will accumulate every year</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re immortal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no actual, humans die, but the laws don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we need a garbage collection function</p>
<p>for rules and regulations.</p>
<p>They should not just be immortal</p>
<p>because some of the rules and regulations</p>
<p>that are put in place will be counterproductive,</p>
<p>done with good intentions, but counterproductive.</p>
<p>Sometimes not done with good intentions.</p>
<p>So if rules and regulations just accumulate every year</p>
<p>and you get more and more of them,</p>
<p>then eventually you won&rsquo;t be able to do anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like Gulliver with, you know,</p>
<p>tied down by thousands of little structures</p>
<p>by thousands of little strings.</p>
<p>And we see that in, you know, US and like basically</p>
<p>all economies that have been around for a while</p>
<p>and regulators and legislators create new rules</p>
<p>and regulations every year,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t put effort into removing them.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very important that we put effort</p>
<p>into removing rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But it gets tough because you get special interests</p>
<p>that then are dependent on, like they have, you know,</p>
<p>a vested interest in that whatever rule and regulation</p>
<p>and then they fight to not get it removed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, I guess the problem with the constitution</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s kind of like C versus Java</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have any garbage collection built in.</p>
<p>I think there should be, when you first said</p>
<p>the metaphor of garbage collection, I loved it.</p>
<p>Yeah, from a coding standpoint.</p>
<p>From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It would be interesting if the laws themselves</p>
<p>kind of had a built in thing</p>
<p>where they kind of die after a while</p>
<p>unless somebody explicitly publicly defends them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s not like somebody has to kill them.</p>
<p>They kind of die themselves.</p>
<p>They disappear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not to defend Java or anything, but you know, C++,</p>
<p>you know, you could also have a great garbage collection</p>
<p>in Python and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, something needs to happen</p>
<p>or just the civilization&rsquo;s arteries just harden over time</p>
<p>and you can just get less and less done</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a rule against everything.</p>
<p>So I think like, I don&rsquo;t know, for Mars or whatever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, or even for, you know, obviously for Earth as well,</p>
<p>like I think there should be an active process</p>
<p>for removing rules and regulations</p>
<p>and questioning their existence.</p>
<p>Just like if we&rsquo;ve got a function</p>
<p>for creating rules and regulations,</p>
<p>because rules and regulations can also think of us</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re like software or lines of code</p>
<p>for operating civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rules and regulations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we shouldn&rsquo;t have rules and regulations,</p>
<p>but you have code accumulation, but no code removal.</p>
<p>And so it just gets to become basically archaic bloatware</p>
<p>after a while.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it makes it hard for things to progress.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Mars, you&rsquo;d have like,</p>
<p>you know, any given law must have a sunset, you know,</p>
<p>and require active voting to keep it up there, you know.</p>
<p>And I actually also say like, and these are just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, recommendations or thoughts,</p>
<p>ultimately will be up to the people on Mars to decide.</p>
<p>But I think it should be easier to remove a law</p>
<p>than to add one because of the,</p>
<p>just to overcome the inertia of laws.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s like, for argument&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect,</p>
<p>but only a 40% vote to remove it.</p>
<p>So let me be the guy, you posted a meme on Twitter recently</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a row of urinals,</p>
<p>and a guy just walks all the way across,</p>
<p>and he tells you about crypto.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s happened to me so many times.</p>
<p>I think maybe even literally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think, technologically speaking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any room for ideas of smart contracts or so on?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned laws.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting use of things like smart contracts</p>
<p>to implement the laws by which governments function.</p>
<p>Like something built on Ethereum,</p>
<p>or maybe a dog coin that enables smart contracts somehow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite understand this whole smart contract thing.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m too dumb to understand smart contracts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>I mean, my general approach to any kind of deal or whatever</p>
<p>is just make sure there&rsquo;s clarity of understanding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>And just keep any kind of deal very short and simple,</p>
<p>plain language, and just make sure everyone understands</p>
<p>this is the deal, is it clear?</p>
<p>And what are the consequences if various things</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen?</p>
<p>But usually deals are, business deals or whatever,</p>
<p>are way too long and complex and overly lawyered</p>
<p>and pointlessly.</p>
<p>You mentioned that Doge is the people&rsquo;s coin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you said that you were literally going,</p>
<p>SpaceX may consider literally putting a Doge coin</p>
<p>on the moon, is this something you&rsquo;re still considering?</p>
<p>Mars, perhaps, do you think there&rsquo;s some chance,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about political systems on Mars,</p>
<p>that Doge coin is the official currency of Mars</p>
<p>at some point in the future?</p>
<p>Well, I think Mars itself will need to have</p>
<p>a different currency because you can&rsquo;t synchronize</p>
<p>due to speed of light, or not easily.</p>
<p>So it must be completely stand alone from Earth.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, because Mars is, at closest approach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s four light minutes away, roughly,</p>
<p>and then at furthest approach, it&rsquo;s roughly</p>
<p>20 light minutes away, maybe a little more.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t really have something synchronizing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got a 20 minute speed of light issue,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s got a one minute blockchain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna synchronize properly.</p>
<p>So Mars, I don&rsquo;t know if Mars would have</p>
<p>a cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably, seems likely.</p>
<p>But it would be some kind of localized thing on Mars.</p>
<p>And you let the people decide.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>The future of Mars should be up to the Martians.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I think the cryptocurrency thing</p>
<p>is an interesting approach to reducing</p>
<p>the error in the database that is called money.</p>
<p>I think I have a pretty deep understanding</p>
<p>of what money actually is on a practical day to day basis</p>
<p>because of PayPal.</p>
<p>We really got in deep there.</p>
<p>And right now, the money system, actually,</p>
<p>for practical purposes, is really a bunch</p>
<p>of heterogeneous mainframes running old COBOL.</p>
<p>Okay, you mean literally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>In batch mode.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In batch mode.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty the poor bastards who have</p>
<p>to maintain that code.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a pain.</p>
<p>Not even Fortran, it&rsquo;s COBOL.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s COBOL.</p>
<p>And the banks are still buying mainframes in 2021</p>
<p>and running ancient COBOL code.</p>
<p>And the Federal Reserve is probably even older</p>
<p>than what the banks have, and they have</p>
<p>an old COBOL mainframe.</p>
<p>And so, the government effectively has editing privileges</p>
<p>on the money database.</p>
<p>And they use those editing privileges to make more money,</p>
<p>whatever they want.</p>
<p>And this increases the error in the database that is money.</p>
<p>So, I think money should really be viewed</p>
<p>through the lens of information theory.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s kind of like an internet connection.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the bandwidth, total bit rate,</p>
<p>what is the latency, jitter, packet drop,</p>
<p>you know, errors in network communication.</p>
<p>Just think of money like that, basically.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the right way to think of it.</p>
<p>And then say what system from an information theory</p>
<p>standpoint allows an economy to function the best.</p>
<p>And, you know, crypto is an attempt to reduce</p>
<p>the error in money that is contributed</p>
<p>by governments diluting the money supply</p>
<p>as basically a pernicious form of taxation.</p>
<p>So, both policy in terms of with inflation</p>
<p>and actual like technological COBOL,</p>
<p>like cryptocurrency takes us into the 21st century</p>
<p>in terms of the actual systems</p>
<p>that allow you to do the transaction,</p>
<p>to store wealth, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Like I said, just think of money as information.</p>
<p>People often will think of money</p>
<p>as having power in and of itself.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>Money is information and it does not have power</p>
<p>in and of itself.</p>
<p>Like, you know, applying the physics tools</p>
<p>of thinking about things in the limit is helpful.</p>
<p>If you are stranded on a tropical island</p>
<p>and you have a trillion dollars, it&rsquo;s useless</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no resource allocation.</p>
<p>Money is a database for resource allocation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no resource to allocate except yourself.</p>
<p>So, money is useless.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re stranded on a desert island with no food,</p>
<p>all the Bitcoin in the world will not stop you</p>
<p>from starving.</p>
<p>So, just think of money as a database</p>
<p>for resource allocation across time and space.</p>
<p>And then what system, in what form</p>
<p>should that database or data system,</p>
<p>what would be most effective?</p>
<p>Now, there is a fundamental issue</p>
<p>with say Bitcoin in its current form</p>
<p>in that the transaction volume is very limited</p>
<p>and the latency for a properly confirmed transaction</p>
<p>is too long, much longer than you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s actually not great from a transaction volume</p>
<p>standpoint or a latency standpoint.</p>
<p>So, it is perhaps useful to solve an aspect</p>
<p>of the money database problem, which is the sort of store</p>
<p>of wealth or an accounting of relative obligations,</p>
<p>I suppose, but it is not useful as a currency,</p>
<p>as a day to day currency.</p>
<p>But people have proposed different technological solutions.</p>
<p>Like Lightning.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lightning Network and the layer two technologies</p>
<p>on top of that.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems to be all kind of a trade off,</p>
<p>but the point is, it&rsquo;s kind of brilliant to say</p>
<p>that just think about information,</p>
<p>think about what kind of database,</p>
<p>what kind of infrastructure enables</p>
<p>that exchange of information.</p>
<p>Yeah, just say like you&rsquo;re operating an economy</p>
<p>and you need to have some thing that allows</p>
<p>for the efficient, to have efficient value ratios</p>
<p>between products and services.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve got this massive number of products</p>
<p>and services and you need to, you can&rsquo;t just barter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, that would be extremely unwieldy.</p>
<p>So, you need something that gives you the ratio</p>
<p>of exchange between goods and services.</p>
<p>And then something that allows you</p>
<p>to shift obligations across time, like debt.</p>
<p>Debt and equity shift obligations across time.</p>
<p>Then what does the best job of that?</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I think there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>Merit Doge coin, even though it was obviously created</p>
<p>as a joke, is that it actually does have</p>
<p>a much higher transaction volume capability than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And the costs of doing a transaction,</p>
<p>the Doge coin fee is very low.</p>
<p>Like right now, if you want to do a Bitcoin transaction,</p>
<p>the price of doing that transaction is very high.</p>
<p>So, you could not use it effectively for most things.</p>
<p>And nor could it even scale to a high volume.</p>
<p>And when Bitcoin started, I guess around 2008</p>
<p>or something like that, the internet connections</p>
<p>were much worse than they are today.</p>
<p>Like Order of magnitude, I mean,</p>
<p>just way, way worse in 2008.</p>
<p>So, like having a small block size or whatever</p>
<p>is, and a long synchronization time made sense in 2008.</p>
<p>But 2021, or fast forward 10 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like comically low.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s some value to having a linear increase</p>
<p>in the amount of currency that is generated.</p>
<p>So, because some amount of the currency,</p>
<p>like if a currency is too deflationary,</p>
<p>or I should say, if a currency is expected</p>
<p>to increase in value over time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s reluctance to spend it.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like, oh, I&rsquo;ll just hold it and not spend it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s scarcity is increasing with time.</p>
<p>So, if I spend it now, then I will regret spending it.</p>
<p>So, I will just, you know, hodl it.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s some dilution of the currency occurring</p>
<p>over time, that&rsquo;s more of an incentive</p>
<p>to use it as a currency.</p>
<p>So, those coins, somewhat randomly has just a fixed,</p>
<p>a number of sort of coins or hash strings</p>
<p>that are generated every year.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s some inflation, but it&rsquo;s not a percentage base.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a percentage of the total amount of money</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fixed number.</p>
<p>So, the percentage of inflation</p>
<p>will necessarily decline over time.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s like the ideal system</p>
<p>for a currency, but I think it actually is</p>
<p>just fundamentally better than anything else I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>just by accident, so.</p>
<p>I like how you said around 2008.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re not, you know, some people suggested</p>
<p>you might be Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve previously said you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Let me ask.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not for sure.</p>
<p>Would you tell us if you were?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a feature or a bug</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s anonymous or she or they?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting kind of quirk of human history</p>
<p>that there is a particular technology</p>
<p>that is a completely anonymous inventor</p>
<p>or creator.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you can look at the evolution of ideas</p>
<p>before the launch of Bitcoin</p>
<p>and see who wrote, you know, about those ideas.</p>
<p>And then, like, I don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>obviously I don&rsquo;t know who created Bitcoin</p>
<p>for practical purposes,</p>
<p>but the evolution of ideas is pretty clear for that.</p>
<p>And like, it seems as though like Nick Szabo</p>
<p>is probably more than anyone else responsible</p>
<p>for the evolution of those ideas.</p>
<p>So, he claims not to be Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s neither here nor there,</p>
<p>but he seems to be the one more responsible</p>
<p>for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not perhaps like singular figures</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t even as important as the figures involved</p>
<p>in the evolution of ideas, the Leto thing, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, you know, perhaps it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>to think about history,</p>
<p>but maybe most names will be forgotten anyway.</p>
<p>What is a name anyway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a name attached to an idea.</p>
<p>What does it even mean, really?</p>
<p>I think Shakespeare had a thing about roses and stuff,</p>
<p>whatever he said.</p>
<p>A rose by any other name, it smells sweet.</p>
<p>I got Elon to quote Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I feel like I accomplished something today.</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer&rsquo;s day?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna clip that out.</p>
<p>I said it to people.</p>
<p>Not more temperate and more fair.</p>
<p>Autopilot.</p>
<p>Tesla autopilot.</p>
<p>Tesla autopilot has been through an incredible journey</p>
<p>over the past six years,</p>
<p>or perhaps even longer in the minds of,</p>
<p>in your mind and the minds of many involved.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s where we first like connected really</p>
<p>was the autopilot stuff, autonomy and.</p>
<p>The whole journey was incredible to me to watch.</p>
<p>I was, because I knew, well, part of it is I was at MIT</p>
<p>and I knew the difficulty of computer vision.</p>
<p>And I knew the whole, I had a lot of colleagues and friends</p>
<p>about the DARPA challenge and knew how difficult it is.</p>
<p>And so there was a natural skepticism</p>
<p>when I first drove a Tesla with the initial system</p>
<p>based on Mobileye.</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no way, so first when I got in,</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no way this car could maintain,</p>
<p>like stay in the lane and create a comfortable experience.</p>
<p>So my intuition initially was that the lane keeping problem</p>
<p>is way too difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Oh, lane keeping, yeah, that&rsquo;s relatively easy.</p>
<p>Well, like, but not this, but solve in the way</p>
<p>that we just, we talked about previous is prototype</p>
<p>versus a thing that actually creates a pleasant experience</p>
<p>over hundreds of thousands of miles or millions.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we had to wrap a lot of code</p>
<p>around the Mobileye thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just work by itself.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the story</p>
<p>of how you approach things sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes you do things from scratch.</p>
<p>Sometimes at first you kind of see what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and then you decide to do from scratch.</p>
<p>That was one of the boldest decisions I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is both in the hardware and the software</p>
<p>to decide to eventually go from scratch.</p>
<p>I thought, again, I was skeptical</p>
<p>of whether that&rsquo;s going to be able to work out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a difficult problem.</p>
<p>And so it was an incredible journey</p>
<p>what I see now with everything,</p>
<p>the hardware, the compute, the sensors,</p>
<p>the things I maybe care and love about most</p>
<p>is the stuff that Andre Karpathy is leading</p>
<p>with the data set selection,</p>
<p>the whole data engine process,</p>
<p>the neural network architectures,</p>
<p>the way that&rsquo;s in the real world,</p>
<p>that network is tested, validated,</p>
<p>all the different test sets,</p>
<p>versus the ImageNet model of computer vision,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s in academia is like real world</p>
<p>artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And Andre&rsquo;s awesome and obviously plays an important role,</p>
<p>but we have a lot of really talented people driving things.</p>
<p>And Ashok is actually the head of autopilot engineering.</p>
<p>Andre&rsquo;s the director of AI.</p>
<p>AI stuff, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m aware that there&rsquo;s an incredible team</p>
<p>of just a lot going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously people will give me too much credit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give Andre too much credit, so.</p>
<p>And people should realize how much is going on</p>
<p>under the hood.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a lot of really talented people.</p>
<p>The Tesla Autopilot AI team is extremely talented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some of the smartest people in the world.</p>
<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;re getting it done.</p>
<p>What are some insights you&rsquo;ve gained</p>
<p>over those five, six years of autopilot</p>
<p>about the problem of autonomous driving?</p>
<p>So you leaped in having some sort of</p>
<p>first principles kinds of intuitions,</p>
<p>but nobody knows how difficult the problem, like the problem.</p>
<p>I thought the self driving problem would be hard,</p>
<p>but it was harder than I thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I thought it would be easy.</p>
<p>I thought it would be very hard,</p>
<p>but it was actually way harder than even that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, what it comes down to at the end of the day</p>
<p>is to solve self driving,</p>
<p>you basically need to recreate what humans do to drive,</p>
<p>which is humans drive with optical sensors,</p>
<p>eyes and biological neural nets.</p>
<p>And so in order to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the entire road system is designed to work</p>
<p>with basically passive optical and neural nets,</p>
<p>biologically.</p>
<p>And now that we need to,</p>
<p>so for actually for full self driving to work,</p>
<p>we have to recreate that in digital form.</p>
<p>So we have to, that means cameras with advanced neural nets</p>
<p>in silicon form, and then it will obviously solve</p>
<p>for full self driving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any other way.</p>
<p>But the question is what aspects of human nature</p>
<p>do you have to encode into the machine, right?</p>
<p>Do you have to solve the perception problem, like detect?</p>
<p>And then you first realize</p>
<p>what is the perception problem for driving,</p>
<p>like all the kinds of things you have to be able to see,</p>
<p>like what do we even look at when we drive?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I just recently heard Andre talked about MIT</p>
<p>about car doors.</p>
<p>I think it was the world&rsquo;s greatest talk of all time</p>
<p>about car doors, the fine details of car doors.</p>
<p>Like what is even an open car door, man?</p>
<p>So like the ontology of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a perception problem.</p>
<p>We humans solve that perception problem,</p>
<p>and Tesla has to solve that problem.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the control and the planning</p>
<p>coupled with the perception.</p>
<p>You have to figure out like what&rsquo;s involved in driving,</p>
<p>like especially in all the different edge cases.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, maybe you can comment on this,</p>
<p>how much game theoretic kind of stuff needs to be involved</p>
<p>at a four way stop sign.</p>
<p>As humans, when we drive, our actions affect the world.</p>
<p>Like it changes how others behave.</p>
<p>Most autonomous driving, if you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re usually just responding to the scene</p>
<p>as opposed to like really asserting yourself in the scene.</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>I think these sort of control logic conundrums</p>
<p>are not the hard part.</p>
<p>The, you know, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>What do you think is the hard part</p>
<p>in this whole beautiful, complex problem?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of freaking software, man.</p>
<p>A lot of smart lines of code.</p>
<p>For sure, in order to have,</p>
<p>create an accurate vector space.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re coming from image space,</p>
<p>which is like this flow of photons,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to the camera, cameras,</p>
<p>and then you have this massive bitstream</p>
<p>in image space, and then you have to effectively compress</p>
<p>a massive bitstream corresponding to photons</p>
<p>that knocked off an electron in a camera sensor</p>
<p>and turn that bitstream into a vector space.</p>
<p>By vector space, I mean like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got cars and humans and lane lines and curves</p>
<p>and traffic lights and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got all of that in your head,</p>
<p>once you have an accurate vector space,</p>
<p>the control problem is similar to that of a video game,</p>
<p>like a Grand Theft Auto of Cyberpunk,</p>
<p>if you have accurate vector space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the control problem is,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s trivial, it&rsquo;s not trivial,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like some insurmountable thing.</p>
<p>Having an accurate vector space is very difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we humans don&rsquo;t give enough respect</p>
<p>to how incredible the human perception system is</p>
<p>to mapping the raw photons to the vector space</p>
<p>representation in our heads.</p>
<p>Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing</p>
<p>and giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image.</p>
<p>Like when we look around here, we see,</p>
<p>like you see color in the corners of your eyes,</p>
<p>but actually your eyes have very few cones,</p>
<p>like cone receptors in the peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize it,</p>
<p>but their eyes are actually painting color</p>
<p>and your eyes also have like this blood vessels</p>
<p>and all sorts of gnarly things and there&rsquo;s a blind spot,</p>
<p>but do you see your blind spot?</p>
<p>No, your brain is painting in the missing, the blind spot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna do these things online where you look here</p>
<p>and look at this point and then look at this point</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s in your blind spot,</p>
<p>your brain will just fill in the missing bits.</p>
<p>The peripheral vision is so cool.</p>
<p>It makes you realize all the illusions for vision sciences,</p>
<p>so it makes you realize just how incredible the brain is.</p>
<p>The brain is doing crazy amount of post processing</p>
<p>on the vision signals for your eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>And then even once you get all those vision signals,</p>
<p>your brain is constantly trying to forget</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>So human memory is,</p>
<p>perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory.</p>
<p>So because memory is so expensive to our brain</p>
<p>and so limited,</p>
<p>your brain is trying to forget as much as possible</p>
<p>and distill the things that you see</p>
<p>into the smallest amounts of information possible.</p>
<p>So your brain is trying to not just get to a vector space,</p>
<p>but get to a vector space that is the smallest possible</p>
<p>vector space of only relevant objects.</p>
<p>And I think you can sort of look inside your brain</p>
<p>or at least I can,</p>
<p>when you drive down the road and try to think about</p>
<p>what your brain is actually doing consciously.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ll see a car,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have cameras,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have eyes in the back of your head or a side.</p>
<p>So you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal.</p>
<p>And eyesight is not that great.</p>
<p>Okay, human eyes are like,</p>
<p>and people are constantly distracted</p>
<p>and thinking about things and texting</p>
<p>and doing all sorts of things they shouldn&rsquo;t do in a car,</p>
<p>changing the radio station.</p>
<p>So having arguments is like,</p>
<p>so when&rsquo;s the last time you looked right and left</p>
<p>and rearward, or even diagonally forward</p>
<p>to actually refresh your vector space?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re glancing around and what your mind is doing</p>
<p>is trying to distill the relevant vectors,</p>
<p>basically objects with a position and motion.</p>
<p>And then editing that down to the least amount</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary for you to drive.</p>
<p>It does seem to be able to edit it down</p>
<p>or compress it even further into things like concepts.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like it goes beyond,</p>
<p>the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space</p>
<p>to sort of space of concepts to where you&rsquo;ll see a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer represented spatially somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a concept that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Like if this is a school zone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll remember that as a concept,</p>
<p>which is a weird thing to represent,</p>
<p>but perhaps for driving,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to fully represent those things.</p>
<p>Or maybe you get those kind of indirectly.</p>
<p>You need to establish vector space</p>
<p>and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces.</p>
<p>So if you drive past, say a bus and you see that there&rsquo;s people,</p>
<p>before you drove past the bus,</p>
<p>you saw people crossing or some,</p>
<p>just imagine there&rsquo;s like a large truck</p>
<p>or something blocking site.</p>
<p>But before you came up to the truck,</p>
<p>you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road</p>
<p>in front of the truck.</p>
<p>Now you can no longer see the kids,</p>
<p>but you would now know, okay,</p>
<p>those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck</p>
<p>and cross the road, even though you cannot see them.</p>
<p>So you have to have memory,</p>
<p>you have to need to remember that there were kids there</p>
<p>and you need to have some forward prediction</p>
<p>of what their position will be at the time of relevance.</p>
<p>So with occlusions and computer vision,</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t see an object anymore,</p>
<p>even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really, really,</p>
<p>I mean, at least in academic literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tracking through occlusions, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>I understand this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So some of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like object permanence,</p>
<p>like same thing happens with humans with neural nets.</p>
<p>Like when like a toddler grows up,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a point in time where they develop,</p>
<p>they have a sense of object permanence.</p>
<p>So before a certain age, if you have a ball or a toy</p>
<p>or whatever, and you put it behind your back</p>
<p>and you pop it out, if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>before they have object permanence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a new thing every time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whoa, this toy went poof, just fared</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s back again and they can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And that they can play peekaboo all day long</p>
<p>because peekaboo is fresh every time.</p>
<p>But then we figured out object permanence,</p>
<p>then they realize, oh no, the object is not gone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just behind your back.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important problem to solve.</p>
<p>Yes, so like an important evolution</p>
<p>of the neural nets in the car is</p>
<p>memory across both time and space.</p>
<p>So now you can&rsquo;t remember, like you have to say,</p>
<p>like how long do you want to remember things for?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a cost to remembering things for a long time.</p>
<p>So you can like run out of memory</p>
<p>to try to remember too much for too long.</p>
<p>And then you also have things that are stale</p>
<p>if you remember them for too long.</p>
<p>And then you also need things that are remembered over time.</p>
<p>So even if you like say have like,</p>
<p>for our good sake, five seconds of memory on a time basis,</p>
<p>but like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re parked at a light</p>
<p>and you saw, use a pedestrian example,</p>
<p>that people were waiting to cross the road</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t quite see them because of an occlusion,</p>
<p>but they might wait for a minute before the light changes</p>
<p>for them to cross the road.</p>
<p>You still need to remember that that&rsquo;s where they were</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re probably going</p>
<p>to cross the road type of thing.</p>
<p>So even if that exceeds your time based memory,</p>
<p>it should not exceed your space memory.</p>
<p>And I just think the data engine side of that,</p>
<p>so getting the data to learn all of the concepts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re saying now is an incredible process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this iterative process of just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this hydranet of many.</p>
<p>Hydranet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re changing the name to something else.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be equally as Rick and Morty like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rearchitected the neural net,</p>
<p>the neural nets in the cars so many times it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Oh, so every time there&rsquo;s a new major version,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll rename it to something more ridiculous</p>
<p>or memorable and beautiful, sorry.</p>
<p>Not ridiculous, of course.</p>
<p>If you see the full array of neural nets</p>
<p>that are operating in the cars,</p>
<p>it kind of boggles the mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many layers, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>And we started off with simple neural nets</p>
<p>that were basically image recognition</p>
<p>on a single frame from a single camera</p>
<p>and then trying to knit those together</p>
<p>with C, I should say we&rsquo;re really primarily running C here</p>
<p>because C++ is too much overhead</p>
<p>and we have our own C compiler.</p>
<p>So to get maximum performance,</p>
<p>we actually wrote our own C compiler</p>
<p>and are continuing to optimize our C compiler</p>
<p>for maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve just recently done a new river</p>
<p>on our C compiler that&rsquo;ll compile directly</p>
<p>to our autopilot hardware.</p>
<p>If you want to compile the whole thing down</p>
<p>with your own compiler, like so efficiency here,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all kinds of compute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s CPU, GPU, there&rsquo;s like basic types of things</p>
<p>and you have to somehow figure out the scheduling</p>
<p>across all of those things.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re compiling the code down that does all, okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a lot of people involved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hardcore software engineering</p>
<p>at a very sort of bare metal level</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to do a lot of compute</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constrained to our full self driving computer.</p>
<p>So we want to try to have the highest frames per second</p>
<p>possible in a sort of very finite amount of compute</p>
<p>and power.</p>
<p>So we really put a lot of effort into the efficiency</p>
<p>of our compute.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s actually a lot of work done</p>
<p>by some very talented software engineers at Tesla</p>
<p>that at a very foundational level</p>
<p>to improve the efficiency of compute</p>
<p>and how we use the trip accelerators,</p>
<p>which are basically, you know,</p>
<p>doing matrix math dot products,</p>
<p>like a bazillion dot products.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what are neural nets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like compute wise, like 99% dot products.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>And you want to achieve as many high frame rates</p>
<p>like a video game.</p>
<p>You want full resolution, high frame rate.</p>
<p>High frame rate, low latency, low jitter.</p>
<p>So I think one of the things we&rsquo;re moving towards now</p>
<p>is no post processing of the image</p>
<p>through the image signal processor.</p>
<p>So like what happens for cameras is that,</p>
<p>almost all cameras is they,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of post processing done</p>
<p>in order to make pictures look pretty.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t care about pictures looking pretty.</p>
<p>We just want the data.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re moving just raw photon counts.</p>
<p>So the system will, like the image that the computer sees</p>
<p>is actually much more than what you&rsquo;d see</p>
<p>if you represented it on a camera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got much more data.</p>
<p>And even in a very low light conditions,</p>
<p>you can see that there&rsquo;s a small photon count difference</p>
<p>between this spot here and that spot there,</p>
<p>which means that,</p>
<p>so it can see in the dark incredibly well</p>
<p>because it can detect these tiny differences</p>
<p>in photon counts.</p>
<p>Like much better than you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>So, and then we also save 13 milliseconds on a latency.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>From removing the post processing on the image?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;ve got eight cameras</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s roughly, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>one and a half milliseconds or so,</p>
<p>maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency for each camera.</p>
<p>And so like going to just,</p>
<p>basically bypassing the image processor</p>
<p>gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency,</p>
<p>which is important.</p>
<p>And we track latency all the way from, you know,</p>
<p>photon hits the camera to, you know,</p>
<p>all the steps that it&rsquo;s got to go through to get,</p>
<p>you know, go through the various neural nets</p>
<p>and the C code.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit of C++ there as well.</p>
<p>Well, I can maybe a lot, but it,</p>
<p>the core stuff is heavy duty computers all in C.</p>
<p>And so we track that latency all the way</p>
<p>to an output command to the drive unit to accelerate</p>
<p>the brakes just to slow down the steering,</p>
<p>you know, turn left or right.</p>
<p>So, cause you go to output a command</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got to go to a controller.</p>
<p>And like some of these controllers have an update frequency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe 10 Hertz or something like that,</p>
<p>which is slow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like now you lose a hundred milliseconds potentially.</p>
<p>So, so then we want to update the,</p>
<p>the drivers on the like say steering and braking control</p>
<p>to have more like a hundred Hertz instead of 10 Hertz.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got a 10 millisecond latency</p>
<p>instead of a hundred millisecond worst case latency.</p>
<p>And actually jitter is more of a challenge than latency.</p>
<p>Cause latency is like, you can, you can,</p>
<p>you can anticipate and predict, but if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve got a stack up of things going</p>
<p>from the camera to the, to the computer through</p>
<p>then a series of other computers,</p>
<p>and finally to an actuator on the car,</p>
<p>if you have a stack up of tolerances of timing tolerances,</p>
<p>then you can have quite a variable latency,</p>
<p>which is called jitter.</p>
<p>And, and that makes it hard to, to, to anticipate exactly</p>
<p>what, how you should turn the car or accelerate,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;ve got maybe a hundred,</p>
<p>50, 200 milliseconds of jitter,</p>
<p>then you could be off by, you know, up to 0.2 seconds.</p>
<p>And this can make, this could make a big difference.</p>
<p>So you have to interpolate somehow to, to, to,</p>
<p>to deal with the effects of jitter.</p>
<p>So that you can make like robust control decisions.</p>
<p>You have to, so the jitters and the sensor information,</p>
<p>or the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline.</p>
<p>You can, if you have just, if you have fixed latency,</p>
<p>you can anticipate and, and like say, okay,</p>
<p>we know that our information is for argument&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>150 milliseconds stale.</p>
<p>Like, so for, for, for 150 milliseconds</p>
<p>from photon second camera to where you can measure a change</p>
<p>in the acceleration of the vehicle.</p>
<p>So then, then you can say, okay, well, we&rsquo;re going to enter,</p>
<p>we know it&rsquo;s 150 milliseconds.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to take that into account</p>
<p>and, and compensate for that latency.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;ve got then 150 milliseconds of latency</p>
<p>plus a hundred milliseconds of jitter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s which could be anywhere from zero,</p>
<p>zero to a hundred milliseconds on top.</p>
<p>So, so then your latency could be from 150 to 250 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got a hundred milliseconds</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know what to do with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically random.</p>
<p>So getting rid of jitter is extremely important.</p>
<p>And that affects your control decisions</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, the car&rsquo;s just going to fundamentally maneuver better</p>
<p>with lower jitter.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>The cars will maneuver with superhuman ability</p>
<p>and reaction time much faster than a human.</p>
<p>I mean, I think over time the autopilot,</p>
<p>full self driving will be capable of maneuvers</p>
<p>that are far more than what like James Bond could do</p>
<p>in like the best movie type of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I was imagining in my mind,</p>
<p>as you said it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an impossible maneuvers</p>
<p>that a human couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask sort of looking back the six years,</p>
<p>looking out into the future,</p>
<p>based on your current understanding,</p>
<p>how hard do you think this,</p>
<p>this full self driving problem,</p>
<p>when do you think Tesla will solve level four FSD?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s looking quite likely</p>
<p>that it will be next year.</p>
<p>And what does the solution look like?</p>
<p>Is it the current pool of FSD beta candidates,</p>
<p>they start getting greater and greater</p>
<p>as they have been degrees of autonomy,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a certain level</p>
<p>beyond which they can do their own,</p>
<p>they can read a book.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>I mean, you can see that anybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been following the full self driving beta closely</p>
<p>will see that the rate of disengagements</p>
<p>has been dropping rapidly.</p>
<p>So like disengagement be where the driver intervenes</p>
<p>to prevent the car from doing something dangerous,</p>
<p>potentially, so.</p>
<p>So the interventions per million miles</p>
<p>has been dropping dramatically at some point.</p>
<p>And that trend looks like it happens next year</p>
<p>is that the probability of an accident on FSD</p>
<p>is less than that of the average human,</p>
<p>and then significantly less than that of the average human.</p>
<p>So it certainly appears like we will get there next year.</p>
<p>Then of course, then there&rsquo;s gonna be a case of,</p>
<p>okay, well, we now have to prove this to regulators</p>
<p>and prove it to, you know, and we want a standard</p>
<p>that is not just equivalent to a human,</p>
<p>but much better than the average human.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gotta be at least two or three times</p>
<p>two or three times higher safety than a human.</p>
<p>So two or three times lower probability of injury</p>
<p>than a human before we would actually say like,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s okay to go, it&rsquo;s not gonna be equivalent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be much better.</p>
<p>So if you look, FSD 10.6 just came out recently,</p>
<p>10.7 is on the way, maybe 11 is on the way,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were hoping to get 11 out this year,</p>
<p>but 11 actually has a whole bunch of fundamental rewrites</p>
<p>on the neural net architecture,</p>
<p>and some fundamental improvements</p>
<p>in creating vector space, so.</p>
<p>There is some fundamental like leap</p>
<p>that really deserves the 11,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a pretty cool number.</p>
<p>Yeah, 11 would be a single stack</p>
<p>for all, you know, one stack to rule them all.</p>
<p>But there are just some really fundamental</p>
<p>neural net architecture changes</p>
<p>that will allow for much more capability,</p>
<p>but at first they&rsquo;re gonna have issues.</p>
<p>So like we have this working on like sort of alpha software</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s basically taking a whole bunch</p>
<p>of C, C++ code and leading a massive amount of C++ code</p>
<p>and replacing it with a neural net.</p>
<p>And Andre makes this point a lot,</p>
<p>which is like neural nets are kind of eating software.</p>
<p>Over time there&rsquo;s like less and less conventional software,</p>
<p>more and more neural net, which is still software,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, still comes out the lines of software,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more neural net stuff</p>
<p>and less, you know, heuristics basically.</p>
<p>More matrix based stuff and less heuristics based stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, like one of the big changes will be,</p>
<p>like right now the neural nets will deliver</p>
<p>a giant bag of points to the C++ or C and C++ code.</p>
<p>We call it the giant bag of points.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, so you&rsquo;ve got a pixel and something associated</p>
<p>with that pixel.</p>
<p>Like this pixel is probably car.</p>
<p>The pixel is probably lane line.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got to assemble this giant bag of points</p>
<p>in the C code and turn it into vectors.</p>
<p>And it does a pretty good job of it, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we want to just, you know,</p>
<p>we need another layer of neural nets on top of that</p>
<p>to take the giant bag of points and distill that down</p>
<p>to a vector space in the neural net part of the software,</p>
<p>as opposed to the heuristics part of the software.</p>
<p>This is a big improvement.</p>
<p>Neural nets all the way down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even all neural nets, but this will be just a,</p>
<p>this is a game changer to not have the bag of points,</p>
<p>the giant bag of points that has to be assembled</p>
<p>with many lines of C++ and have the,</p>
<p>and have a neural net just assemble those into a vector.</p>
<p>So the neural net is outputting much, much less data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outputting, this is a lane line.</p>
<p>This is a curb.</p>
<p>This is drivable space.</p>
<p>This is a car.</p>
<p>This is a pedestrian or a cyclist or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outputting, it&rsquo;s really outputting proper vectors</p>
<p>to the C, C++ control code,</p>
<p>as opposed to the sort of constructing the vectors in C,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve done, I think, quite a good job of,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re kind of hitting a local maximum</p>
<p>on how well the C can do this.</p>
<p>So this is really a big deal.</p>
<p>And just all of the networks in the car</p>
<p>need to move to surround video.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some legacy networks that are not surround video.</p>
<p>And all of the training needs to move to surround video</p>
<p>and the efficiency of the training,</p>
<p>it needs to get better and it is.</p>
<p>And then we need to move everything to raw photon counts</p>
<p>as opposed to processed images,</p>
<p>which is quite a big reset on the training</p>
<p>because the system&rsquo;s trained on post processed images.</p>
<p>So we need to redo all the training</p>
<p>to train against the raw photon counts</p>
<p>instead of the post processed image.</p>
<p>So ultimately, it&rsquo;s kind of reducing the complexity</p>
<p>of the whole thing.</p>
<p>So reducing the&hellip;</p>
<p>Lines of code will actually go lower.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing fusion of all the sensors</p>
<p>and reducing the complexity of having to deal with these&hellip;</p>
<p>Fusion of the cameras.</p>
<p>Fusion of the cameras, really.</p>
<p>Right, yes.</p>
<p>Same with humans.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we&rsquo;ve got ears too.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll actually need to incorporate sound as well</p>
<p>because you need to listen for ambulance sirens</p>
<p>or fire trucks or somebody yelling at you or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well.</p>
<p>Do you need to go back for a break?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, let&rsquo;s take a break.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Honestly, frankly, the ideas are the easy thing</p>
<p>and the implementation is the hard thing.</p>
<p>The idea of going to the moon is the easy part.</p>
<p>Not going to the moon is the hard part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hard part.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of hardcore engineering</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got to get done at the hardware and software level.</p>
<p>Like I said, optimizing the C compiler</p>
<p>and just cutting out latency everywhere.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t do this, the system will not work properly.</p>
<p>So the work of the engineers doing this,</p>
<p>they are like the unsung heroes,</p>
<p>but they are critical to the success of the situation.</p>
<p>I think you made it clear.</p>
<p>I mean, at least to me, it&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s going on outside of what Andre is doing.</p>
<p>Just the whole infrastructure, the software.</p>
<p>I mean, everything is going on with Data Engine,</p>
<p>whatever it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>The whole process is just work of art to me.</p>
<p>The sheer scale of it boggles my mind.</p>
<p>Like the training, the amount of work done with,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve written all this custom software for training and labeling</p>
<p>and to do auto labeling.</p>
<p>Auto labeling is essential.</p>
<p>Because especially when you&rsquo;ve got surround video, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>To label surround video from scratch is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Like take a human such a long time to even label one video clip,</p>
<p>like several hours.</p>
<p>Or the auto label, basically we just apply heavy duty,</p>
<p>like a lot of compute to the video clips to preassign</p>
<p>and guess what all the things are that are going on in the surround video.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like correcting it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then all the human has to do is like tweet,</p>
<p>like say, adjust what is incorrect.</p>
<p>This is like increases productivity by in fact a hundred or more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve presented Tesla Bot as primarily useful in the factory.</p>
<p>First of all, I think humanoid robots are incredible.</p>
<p>From a fan of robotics, I think the elegance of movement</p>
<p>that humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show are just so cool.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting that you&rsquo;re working on this</p>
<p>and also talking about applying the same kind of all the ideas,</p>
<p>some of which we&rsquo;ve talked about with Data Engine,</p>
<p>all the things that we&rsquo;re talking about with Tesla Autopilot,</p>
<p>just transferring that over to just yet another robotics problem.</p>
<p>I have to ask, since I care about human robot interaction,</p>
<p>so the human side of that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about mostly in the factory.</p>
<p>Do you see part of this problem that Tesla Bot has to solve</p>
<p>is interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home.</p>
<p>So interacting, not just not replacing labor, but also like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>being a friend or an assistant or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite in Tesla&rsquo;s primary mission direction</p>
<p>of accelerating sustainable energy,</p>
<p>but it is an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world,</p>
<p>which is to make a useful humanoid robot that is capable of interacting with the world</p>
<p>and helping in many different ways.</p>
<p>I think if you say extrapolate to many years in the future,</p>
<p>I think work will become optional.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of jobs that if people weren&rsquo;t paid to do it,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun necessarily.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re washing dishes all day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, even if you really like washing dishes,</p>
<p>you really want to do it for eight hours a day every day.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like dangerous work.</p>
<p>And basically, if it&rsquo;s dangerous, boring,</p>
<p>it has like potential for repetitive stress injury, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Then that&rsquo;s really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming for is for the humanoid robots to do jobs</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t voluntarily want to do.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll have to pair that obviously</p>
<p>with some kind of universal basic income in the future.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>So do you see a world when there&rsquo;s like hundreds of millions of Tesla bots</p>
<p>doing different, performing different tasks throughout the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t really thought about it that far into the future,</p>
<p>but I guess there may be something like that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Can I ask a wild question?</p>
<p>So the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been close to two million produced.</p>
<p>Many of them have autopilot.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re over two million now.</p>
<p>Do you think there will ever be a time when there will be more Tesla bots</p>
<p>than Tesla cars?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s funny you asked this question,</p>
<p>because normally I do try to think pretty far into the future,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t really thought that far into the future with the Tesla bot,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s codenamed Optimus.</p>
<p>I call it Optimus subprime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a giant transformer robot.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s meant to be a general purpose, helpful bot.</p>
<p>And basically, like the things that we&rsquo;re basically like, like,</p>
<p>Tesla, I think is the has the most advanced real world AI</p>
<p>for interacting with the real world,</p>
<p>which are developed as a function of to make self driving work.</p>
<p>And so along with custom hardware and like a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>hardcore low level software to have it run efficiently</p>
<p>and be power efficient because it&rsquo;s one thing to do neural nets</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s say you just you have to now distill that down</p>
<p>into one computer that&rsquo;s running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually very difficult.</p>
<p>A lot of hardcore software work is required for that.</p>
<p>So since we&rsquo;re kind of like solving the navigate the real world</p>
<p>with neural nets problem for cars,</p>
<p>which are kind of robots with four wheels,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like kind of a natural extension of that is to put it</p>
<p>in a robot with arms and legs and actuators.</p>
<p>So like the two hard things are like you basically need to make the</p>
<p>have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way</p>
<p>with the environment.</p>
<p>So you need real world AI and you need to be very good at manufacturing,</p>
<p>which is a very hard problem.</p>
<p>Tesla is very good at manufacturing and also has the real world AI.</p>
<p>So making the humanoid robot work is basically means developing custom motors</p>
<p>and sensors that are different from what a car would use.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve also we have I think we have the best expertise</p>
<p>in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics.</p>
<p>So it just has to be for humanoid robot application on a car.</p>
<p>Still, you do talk about love sometimes.</p>
<p>So let me ask.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t like for like sex robots or something like that.</p>
<p>Love is the answer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is something compelling to us, not compelling,</p>
<p>but we connect with humanoid robots or even like robots like with the dog</p>
<p>and shapes of dogs.</p>
<p>It just it seems like, you know, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of loneliness in this world.</p>
<p>All of us seek companionship with other humans, friendship</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We have a lot of here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs.</p>
<p>There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease</p>
<p>the amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other.</p>
<p>So in a way that dogs can.</p>
<p>Do you think about that with TeslaBot at all?</p>
<p>Or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks,</p>
<p>not connecting with humans?</p>
<p>I mean, to be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companionship</p>
<p>standpoint, but I think it actually would end up being it could be actually</p>
<p>a very good companion.</p>
<p>And it could develop like a personality over time that is that is like unique,</p>
<p>like, you know, it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re just all the robots are the same</p>
<p>and that personality could evolve to be, you know,</p>
<p>match the owner or the, you know, yes, the owner.</p>
<p>Well, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>The other half, right?</p>
<p>In the same way that friends do.</p>
<p>See, I think that&rsquo;s a huge opportunity.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Because, you know, like there&rsquo;s a Japanese phrase I like, Wabi Sabi,</p>
<p>you know, the subtle imperfections are what makes something special.</p>
<p>And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot mapped</p>
<p>to the subtle imperfections of the robot&rsquo;s human friend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, owner sounds like maybe the wrong word,</p>
<p>but could actually make an incredible buddy, basically.</p>
<p>In that way, the imperfections.</p>
<p>Like R2D2 or like a C3PO sort of thing, you know.</p>
<p>So from a machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>I think the flaws being a feature is really nice.</p>
<p>You could be quite terrible at being a robot for quite a while</p>
<p>in the general home environment or in general world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of adorable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, those are your flaws and you fall in love with those flaws.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very different than autonomous driving</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a very high stakes environment you cannot mess up.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s more fun to be a robot in the home.</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, if you think of like C3PO and R2D2,</p>
<p>like they actually had a lot of like flaws and imperfections</p>
<p>and silly things and they would argue with each other.</p>
<p>Were they actually good at doing anything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>They definitely added a lot to the story.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s sort of quirky elements and, you know,</p>
<p>that they would like make mistakes and do things.</p>
<p>It was like it made them relatable, I don&rsquo;t know, enduring.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that that could be something that probably would happen.</p>
<p>But our initial focus is just to make it useful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll get it done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the exact timeframe is,</p>
<p>but like we&rsquo;ll probably have, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a decent prototype towards the end of next year or something like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cool that it&rsquo;s connected to Tesla, the car.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s using a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>it would use the autopilot inference computer</p>
<p>and a lot of the training that we&rsquo;ve done for cars</p>
<p>in terms of recognizing real world things</p>
<p>could be applied directly to the robot.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of custom actuators and sensors that need to be developed.</p>
<p>And an extra module on top of the vector space for love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>We can add that to the car too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be useful in all environments.</p>
<p>Like you said, a lot of people argue in the car,</p>
<p>so maybe we can help them out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a student of history,</p>
<p>fan of Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Hardcore History podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Greatest podcast ever?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is actually.</p>
<p>It almost doesn&rsquo;t really count as a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like an audio book.</p>
<p>So you were on the podcast with Dan.</p>
<p>I just had a chat with him about it.</p>
<p>He said you guys went military and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was basically, it should be titled Engineer Wars, essentially.</p>
<p>Like when there&rsquo;s a rapid change in the rate of technology,</p>
<p>then engineering plays a pivotal role in victory and battle.</p>
<p>How far back in history did you go?</p>
<p>Did you go World War II?</p>
<p>Well, it was supposed to be a deep dive on fighters and bomber technology in World War II,</p>
<p>but that ended up being more wide ranging than that,</p>
<p>because I just went down the total rathole of studying all of the fighters and bombers of World War II</p>
<p>and the constant rock, paper, scissors game that one country would make this plane,</p>
<p>then it would make a plane to beat that, and that country would make a plane to beat that.</p>
<p>And really what matters is the pace of innovation</p>
<p>and also access to high quality fuel and raw materials.</p>
<p>Germany had some amazing designs, but they couldn&rsquo;t make them</p>
<p>because they couldn&rsquo;t get the raw materials,</p>
<p>and they had a real problem with the oil and fuel, basically.</p>
<p>The fuel quality was extremely variable.</p>
<p>So the design wasn&rsquo;t the bottleneck?</p>
<p>Yeah, the U.S. had kickass fuel that was very consistent.</p>
<p>The problem is if you make a very high performance aircraft engine,</p>
<p>in order to make it high performance, the fuel, the aviation gas,</p>
<p>has to be a consistent mixture and it has to have a high octane.</p>
<p>High octane is the most important thing, but it also can&rsquo;t have impurities and stuff</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll foul up the engine.</p>
<p>And Germany just never had good access to oil.</p>
<p>They tried to get it by invading the Caucasus, but that didn&rsquo;t work too well.</p>
<p>It never worked so well.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work out for them.</p>
<p>See you, Jerry.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Germany was always struggling with basically shitty oil,</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t count on high quality fuel for their aircraft,</p>
<p>so they had to have all these additives and stuff.</p>
<p>Whereas the U.S. had awesome fuel, and they provided that to Britain as well.</p>
<p>So that allowed the British and the Americans to design aircraft engines</p>
<p>that were super high performance, better than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>Germany could design the engines, they just didn&rsquo;t have the fuel.</p>
<p>And then also the quality of the aluminum alloys that they were getting</p>
<p>was also not that great.</p>
<p>Is this like, you talked about all this with Dan?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Broadly looking at history, when you look at Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>when you look at Stalin, Hitler, the darkest moments of human history,</p>
<p>what do you take away from those moments?</p>
<p>Does it help you gain insight about human nature, about human behavior today,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the wars or the individuals or just the behavior of people,</p>
<p>any aspects of history?</p>
<p>Yeah, I find history fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of incredible things that have been done, good and bad,</p>
<p>that they help you understand the nature of civilization and individuals.</p>
<p>Does it make you sad that humans do these kinds of things to each other?</p>
<p>You look at the 20th century, World War II, the cruelty, the abuse of power,</p>
<p>talk about communism, Marxism, and Stalin.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of human history.</p>
<p>Most of it is actually people just getting on with their lives,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like human history is just nonstop war and disaster.</p>
<p>Those are actually just, those are intermittent and rare.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t, then humans would soon cease to exist.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just that wars tend to be written about a lot,</p>
<p>whereas something being like, well,</p>
<p>a normal year where nothing major happened doesn&rsquo;t get written about much.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, most people just like farming and kind of living their life,</p>
<p>being a villager somewhere.</p>
<p>And every now and again, there&rsquo;s a war.</p>
<p>And I would have to say, there aren&rsquo;t very many books where I just had to stop reading</p>
<p>because it was just too dark.</p>
<p>But the book about Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar, I had to stop reading.</p>
<p>It was just too dark and rough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The 30s, there&rsquo;s a lot of lessons there to me,</p>
<p>in particular that it feels like humans,</p>
<p>like all of us have that, it&rsquo;s the old Solzhenitsyn line,</p>
<p>that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man,</p>
<p>that all of us are capable of evil, all of us are capable of good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like this kind of responsibility that all of us have</p>
<p>to tend towards the good.</p>
<p>And so to me, looking at history is almost like an example of,</p>
<p>look, you have some charismatic leader that convinces you of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy, based on that story, to do evil onto each other,</p>
<p>onto your family, onto others.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like our responsibility to do good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like now is somehow different from history.</p>
<p>That can happen again. All of it can happen again.</p>
<p>And yes, most of the time, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>the optimistic view here is mostly people are just living life.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ve often memed about, the quality of life was way worse</p>
<p>back in the day, and this keeps improving over time</p>
<p>through innovation, through technology.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s somehow notable that these blimps of atrocities happen.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, life was really tough for most of history.</p>
<p>I mean, for most of human history, a good year would be one</p>
<p>where not that many people in your village died of the plague,</p>
<p>starvation, freezing to death, or being killed by a neighboring village.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>It was only like we lost 5% this year.</p>
<p>That was a good year.</p>
<p>That would be par for the course.</p>
<p>Just not starving to death would have been the primary goal</p>
<p>of most people throughout history,</p>
<p>is making sure we&rsquo;ll have enough food to last through the winter</p>
<p>and not freeze or whatever.</p>
<p>So, now food is plentiful.</p>
<p>I have an obesity problem.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the lesson there is to be grateful for the way things are now</p>
<p>for some of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken about this offline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your thought about it here.</p>
<p>If I sat down for a long form in person conversation with the President of Russia,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin, would you potentially want to call in for a few minutes</p>
<p>to join in on a conversation with him, moderated and translated by me?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;d be happy to do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve shown interest in the Russian language.</p>
<p>Is this grounded in your interest in history of linguistics, culture, general curiosity?</p>
<p>I think it sounds cool.</p>
<p>Sounds cool and that looks cool.</p>
<p>Well, it takes a moment to read Cyrillic.</p>
<p>Once you know what the Cyrillic characters stand for,</p>
<p>actually then reading Russian becomes a lot easier</p>
<p>because there are a lot of words that are actually the same.</p>
<p>Like bank is bank.</p>
<p>So find the words that are exactly the same and now you start to understand Cyrillic.</p>
<p>If you can sound it out, there&rsquo;s at least some commonality of words.</p>
<p>What about the culture?</p>
<p>You love great engineering, physics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tradition of the sciences there.</p>
<p>You look at the 20th century from rocketry.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest rockets, some of the space exploration has been done in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So do you draw inspiration from that history?</p>
<p>Just how this culture that in many ways, one of the sad things is because of the language,</p>
<p>a lot of it is lost to history because it&rsquo;s not translated.</p>
<p>Because it is in some ways an isolated culture.</p>
<p>It flourishes within its borders.</p>
<p>So do you draw inspiration from those folks, from the history of science engineering there?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine as well have a really strong history in space flight.</p>
<p>Some of the most advanced and impressive things in history were done by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So one cannot help but admire the impressive rocket technology that was developed.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, there&rsquo;s much less that then happened.</p>
<p>But still things are happening, but it&rsquo;s not quite at the frenetic pace that it was happening before the Soviet Union kind of dissolved into separate republics.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s Roscosmos, the Russian agency.</p>
<p>I look forward to a time when those countries with China are working together.</p>
<p>The United States are all working together.</p>
<p>Maybe a little bit of friendly competition.</p>
<p>I think friendly competition is good.</p>
<p>Governments are slow and the only thing slower than one government is a collection of governments.</p>
<p>So the Olympics would be boring if everyone just crossed the finishing line at the same time.</p>
<p>Nobody would watch.</p>
<p>And people wouldn&rsquo;t try hard to run fast and stuff.</p>
<p>So I think friendly competition is a good thing.</p>
<p>This is also a good place to give a shout out to a video titled,</p>
<p>The Entire Soviet Rocket Engine Family Tree by Tim Dodd, AKA Everyday Astronaut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an hour and a half.</p>
<p>It gives the full history of Soviet rockets.</p>
<p>And people should definitely go check out and support Tim in general.</p>
<p>That guy is super excited about the future, super excited about space flight.</p>
<p>Every time I see anything by him, I just have a stupid smile on my face because he&rsquo;s so excited about stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, Tim Dodd is really great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in anything to do with space, he&rsquo;s, in terms of explaining rocket technology to your average person, he&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>The best, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>And I should say like the part of the reason like I switched us from like Rafter at one point was going to be a hydrogen engine.</p>
<p>But hydrogen has a lot of challenges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very low density.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep cryogen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only liquid at a very, very close to absolute zero.</p>
<p>Requires a lot of insulation.</p>
<p>So it is a lot of challenges there.</p>
<p>And I was actually reading a bit about Russian rocket engine developments.</p>
<p>And at least the impression I had was that the Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine primarily were actually in the process of switching to Methalox.</p>
<p>And there were some interesting tests and data for ISP.</p>
<p>Like they were able to get like up to like a 380 second ISP with the Methalox engine.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, OK, that&rsquo;s actually really impressive.</p>
<p>So I think you could actually get a much lower cost, like in optimizing cost per ton to orbit, cost per ton to Mars.</p>
<p>I think Methalox is the way to go.</p>
<p>And I was partly inspired by the Russian work on the test stands with Methalox engines.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different.</p>
<p>Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great, the powerful PewDiePie?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 1 to 11.</p>
<p>Just go over a few documents printed out.</p>
<p>We can try.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this.</p>
<p>I present to you document numero uno.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. OK.</p>
<p>Vladimir Impaler discovers marshmallows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>So you get it? Because he likes impaling things.</p>
<p>Yes, I get it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, three, whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very good.</p>
<p>This is grounded in some engineering, some history.</p>
<p>Yeah, give us an eight out of ten.</p>
<p>What do you think about nuclear power?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of nuclear power.</p>
<p>I think in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters, I think nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what about Chernobyl?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of fear of radiation and stuff.</p>
<p>The problem is a lot of people just don&rsquo;t study engineering or physics.</p>
<p>Just the word radiation just sounds scary.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t calibrate what radiation means.</p>
<p>But radiation is much less dangerous than you think.</p>
<p>For example, Fukushima, when the Fukushima problem happened due to the tsunami,</p>
<p>I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, definitely not, not even slightly, not at all.</p>
<p>That is crazy.</p>
<p>Just to show this is how the danger is so much overplayed compared to what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima.</p>
<p>I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant, and I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on TV in Fukushima.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still alive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even that the risk of these events is low, but the impact of them is&hellip;</p>
<p>The impact is greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know what radiation is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people ask me, what about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, when you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t know, what do you mean photons or particles?</p>
<p>Do you mean, let&rsquo;s say, photons?</p>
<p>What frequency or wavelength?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Do you know that everything&rsquo;s radiating all the time?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, everything&rsquo;s radiating all the time.</p>
<p>Photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically.</p>
<p>And if you want to know what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside.</p>
<p>The sun is a gigantic thermonuclear reactor that you&rsquo;re staring right at it.</p>
<p>Are you still alive?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess radiation is one of the words that could be used as a tool to fear monger by certain people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think people just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the way to fight that fear, I suppose, is to understand, is to learn.</p>
<p>Yeah, just say, okay, how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practically nothing.</p>
<p>And say, how many people have died from coal plants?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very big number.</p>
<p>So, like, obviously we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all.</p>
<p>Coal plants, like, I don&rsquo;t know, 100 to 1,000 times worse for health than nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>You want to go to the next one?</p>
<p>This is really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 90, 180, and 360 degrees.</p>
<p>Everybody loves the math.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit about 270.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super funny.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like, 203.</p>
<p>This is not a, you know, LOL situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was pretty good.</p>
<p>The United States oscillating between establishing and destroying dictatorships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a metronome.</p>
<p>Is that a metronome?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s out of 7 out of 10.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of true.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, this is kind of personal for me.</p>
<p>Next one.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Is this Leica?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s like referring to Leica or something?</p>
<p>As Leica&rsquo;s, like, husband.</p>
<p>Husband.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Yes, this is dog.</p>
<p>Your wife was launched into space.</p>
<p>And then the last one is him with his eyes closed and a bottle of vodka.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Leica didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tell you the full story of, you know, what the impact they had on the loved</p>
<p>ones.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 711 for me.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The Soviet shadow.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>This keeps going on the Russian theme.</p>
<p>First man in space.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>First man on the moon.</p>
<p>Well, I think people do care.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>There is&hellip;</p>
<p>Yuri Gagarin&rsquo;s name will be forever in history, I think.</p>
<p>There is something special about placing, like, stepping foot onto another totally foreign</p>
<p>land.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the journey, like, people that explore the oceans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as important to explore the oceans as to land on a whole new continent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this is about you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;d love to get your comment on this.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, after sending 6.6 billion dollars to the UN to end world hunger, you have three</p>
<p>hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, obviously, 6 billion dollars is not going to end world hunger.</p>
<p>So I mean, the reality is at this point, the world is producing far more food than it can</p>
<p>really consume.</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t have a caloric constraint at this point.</p>
<p>So where there is hunger, it is almost always due to, like, civil war or strife or some</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s not a thing that is extremely rare for it to be just a matter of, like, lack</p>
<p>of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like some civil war in some country and like one part of the</p>
<p>country is literally trying to starve the other part of the country.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much more complex than something that money could solve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s geopolitics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s governments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s money, monetary systems, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, food is extremely cheap these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, the US at this point, you know, among low income families, obesity is</p>
<p>actually another problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, like, obesity, it&rsquo;s not hunger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like too much, you know, too many calories.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that nobody&rsquo;s hungry anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, this is not a simple matter of adding money and solving it.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What do you think that one gets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting&hellip;</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going after empires, world, where did you get those artifacts?</p>
<p>The British Museum.</p>
<p>Shout out to Monty Python.</p>
<p>We found them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The British Museum is pretty great.</p>
<p>I mean, admittedly Britain did take these historical artifacts from all around the world</p>
<p>and put them in London, but, you know, it&rsquo;s not like people can&rsquo;t go see them.</p>
<p>So it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is London for, you know, for a large</p>
<p>segment of the world.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, on balance, the British Museum is a net good, although I&rsquo;m sure a</p>
<p>lot of countries will argue about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as</p>
<p>possible and the British Museum, I think, does a good job of that.</p>
<p>Even if there&rsquo;s a darker aspect to like the history of empire in general, whatever the</p>
<p>empire is, however things were done, it is the history that happened.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sort of erase that history, unfortunately.</p>
<p>You could just become better in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, well, how are we going to pass moral judgment on these things?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like if, you know, if one is going to judge, say, the Russian Empire, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to judge, you know, what everyone was doing at the time and how were the British</p>
<p>relative to everyone.</p>
<p>And I think the British would actually get like a relatively good grade, relatively good</p>
<p>grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what everyone else was doing, they were</p>
<p>not the worst.</p>
<p>Like I said, you got to look at these things in the context of the history at the time</p>
<p>and say, what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against?</p>
<p>And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade when looking</p>
<p>at history at the time.</p>
<p>You know, if you judge history from, you know, from what is morally acceptable today, you</p>
<p>basically are going to give everyone a failing grade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality of like you</p>
<p>could go back 300 years ago, like who&rsquo;s getting a passing grade?</p>
<p>Basically no one.</p>
<p>And we might not get a passing grade from generations that come after us.</p>
<p>What does that one get?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Six, seven.</p>
<p>For the Monty Python, maybe.</p>
<p>I always love Monty Python.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>The Life of Brian and the Quest of the Holy Grail are incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those serious eyebrows.</p>
<p>How important do you think is facial hair to great leadership?</p>
<p>Well, you got a new haircut.</p>
<p>How does that affect your leadership?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Hopefully not.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is that the second no one?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The second is no one.</p>
<p>There is no one competing with Brezhnev.</p>
<p>No one, too.</p>
<p>Those are like epic eyebrows.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Give it a six or seven, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I like this Shakespearean analysis of memes.</p>
<p>Brezhnev, he had a flair for drama as well.</p>
<p>Like, you know, showmanship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It must come from the eyebrows.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Invention, great engineering, look what I invented, that&rsquo;s the best thing since ripped</p>
<p>up bread.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they invented sliced bread, am I just explaining memes at this point?</p>
<p>This is where my life has become a meme, what it like, you know, like a scribe that like</p>
<p>runs around with the kings and just like writes down memes.</p>
<p>I mean, when was the cheeseburger invented?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like an epic invention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, like, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Versus just like a burger or a burger, I guess a burger in general is like, you know, then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, what is a burger, what&rsquo;s a sandwich, and then you start getting a pizza sandwich</p>
<p>and what is the original, it gets into an ontology argument.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But everybody knows like if you order like a burger or cheeseburger or whatever and you</p>
<p>like, you got like, you know, tomato and some lettuce and onions and whatever and, you know,</p>
<p>mayor and ketchup and mustard, it&rsquo;s like epic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve had bread and meat separately for a long time and it was kind of a burger</p>
<p>on the same plate, but somebody who actually combined them into the same thing and then</p>
<p>you bite it and hold it makes it convenient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a materials problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like your hands don&rsquo;t get dirty and whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Well, that is not what I would have guessed, but everyone knows like you, if you order</p>
<p>a cheeseburger, you know what you&rsquo;re getting, you know, it&rsquo;s not like some obtuse, like,</p>
<p>well, I wonder what I&rsquo;ll get, you know, um, you know, uh, fries are, I mean, great.</p>
<p>I mean, they were the devil, but fries are awesome.</p>
<p>And uh, yeah, pizza is incredible.</p>
<p>Food innovation doesn&rsquo;t get enough love, I guess is what we&rsquo;re getting at.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Um, uh, what about the, uh, Matthew McConaughey, Austinite here, uh, president Kennedy, do</p>
<p>you know how to put men on the moon yet?</p>
<p>NASA?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>President Kennedy, it&rsquo;d be a lot cooler if you did.</p>
<p>Pretty much sure, six, six or seven, I suppose.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And this is the last one that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls, 16 chapel boys bath.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a nine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really true.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is our highest ranking meme for today.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like, how do they get away with it?</p>
<p>Lots of nakedness.</p>
<p>I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history.</p>
<p>Uh, as long as people can draw things, there&rsquo;s been a dick pic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a staple of human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a staple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just throughout human history.</p>
<p>You tweeted that you aspire to comedy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re friends with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Might you, uh, do a short standup comedy set at some point in the future, maybe, um, open</p>
<p>for Joe, something like that.</p>
<p>Is that, is that&hellip;</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Standup?</p>
<p>Actual, just full on standup?</p>
<p>Full on standup.</p>
<p>Is that in there or is that&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely difficult if, uh, at least that&rsquo;s what, uh, like Joe says and the comedians</p>
<p>say.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could, um, I mean, I, I, you know, I, I have done standup for friends,</p>
<p>just, uh, impromptu, you know, I&rsquo;ll get, get on like a roof, uh, and they, they do laugh,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re our friends too.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if, if you&rsquo;ve got to call, you know, like a room of strangers, are they</p>
<p>going to actually also find it funny, but I could try, see what happens.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d learn something either way.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>I kind of love, um, both the, when you bomb and when, when you do great, just watching</p>
<p>people, how they deal with it, it&rsquo;s so difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, you&rsquo;re so fragile up there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you and you, you think you&rsquo;re going to be funny.</p>
<p>And when it completely falls flat, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see people deal with like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I might have enough material to do standup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought about it, but I might have enough material.</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t know, like 15 minutes or something.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do a Netflix special.</p>
<p>Netflix special.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Um, what&rsquo;s your favorite Rick and Morty concept, uh, just to spring that on you.</p>
<p>Is there, there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of scientific engineering ideas explored there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the butter robot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great, uh, that&rsquo;s a great show.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>Rick and Morty is awesome.</p>
<p>Somebody that&rsquo;s exactly like you from an alternate dimension showed up there.</p>
<p>Elon Tusk.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That you voiced.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rick and Morty certainly explores a lot of interesting concepts.</p>
<p>Uh, so like what&rsquo;s the favorite one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The butter robot certainly is, uh, you know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s certainly possible to have</p>
<p>too much sentience in a device.</p>
<p>Um, like you don&rsquo;t want to have your toast to be like a super genius toaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to hate, hate life cause all it could do is make his toast.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t want to have like super intelligent stuck in a very limited</p>
<p>device.</p>
<p>Um, do you think it&rsquo;s too easy from a, if we&rsquo;re talking about from the engineering perspective</p>
<p>of super intelligence, like with Marvin the robot, like, is it, it seems like it might</p>
<p>be very easy to engineer just the depressed robot.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not obvious to engineer and robot that&rsquo;s going to find a fulfilling existence.</p>
<p>Sometimes humans I suppose, but, um, I wonder if that&rsquo;s like the default, if you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>a good job on building a robot, it&rsquo;s going to be sad a lot.</p>
<p>Well we can reprogram robots easier than we can reprogram humans.</p>
<p>So I guess if you let it evolve without tinkering, then it might get a sad, uh, but you can change</p>
<p>the optimization function and have it be a cheery robot.</p>
<p>You uh, like I mentioned with, with SpaceX, you give a lot of people hope and a lot of</p>
<p>people look up to you.</p>
<p>Millions of people look up to you.</p>
<p>Uh, if we think about young people in high school, maybe in college, um, what advice</p>
<p>would you give to them about if they want to try to do something big in this world,</p>
<p>they want to really have a big positive impact.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them about their career, maybe about life in general?</p>
<p>Try to be useful.</p>
<p>Um, you know, do things that are useful to your fellow human beings, to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to be useful.</p>
<p>Um, very hard.</p>
<p>Um, you know, are you contributing more than you consume?</p>
<p>You know, like, uh, like can you try to have a positive net contribution to society?</p>
<p>Um, I think that&rsquo;s the thing to aim for, you know, not, not to try to be sort of a leader</p>
<p>for just for the sake of being a leader or whatever.</p>
<p>Um, a lot of time people, a lot of times the people you want as leaders are the people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t want to be leaders.</p>
<p>So, um, if you live a useful life, that is a good life, a life worth having lived.</p>
<p>Um, you know, and I, like I said, I would, I would encourage people to use the mental</p>
<p>tools of physics and apply them broadly in life.</p>
<p>There are the best tools.</p>
<p>When you think about education and self education, what do you recommend?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the university, there&rsquo;s a self study, there is a hands on sort of finding</p>
<p>a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you&rsquo;re passionate about and joining</p>
<p>them as early as possible.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s, uh, taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry,</p>
<p>which, uh, which, which trajectory do you suggest?</p>
<p>In terms of learning about how you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have</p>
<p>the most positive impact.</p>
<p>Well, I encourage people to read a lot of books, just read, basically try to ingest</p>
<p>as much information as you can, uh, and try to also just develop a good general knowledge.</p>
<p>Um, so, so you at least have like a rough lay of the land of the knowledge landscape.</p>
<p>Like try to learn a little bit about a lot of things, um, cause you might not know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really interested in.</p>
<p>How would you know what you&rsquo;re really interested in if you at least aren&rsquo;t like doing a peripheral</p>
<p>explore exploration of broadly of, of the knowledge landscape?</p>
<p>Um, and you talk to people from different walks of life and different, uh, industries</p>
<p>and professions and skills and occupations, like just try to learn as much as possible.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s search for meaning.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the whole thing a search for meaning?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life and all, you know, but just generally, like I said, I would encourage</p>
<p>people to read broadly, um, in many different subject areas, um, and, and, and then try</p>
<p>to find something where there&rsquo;s an overlap of your talents and, and what you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>So people may, may, may be good at something, but, or they may have skill at a particular</p>
<p>thing, but they don&rsquo;t like doing it.</p>
<p>Um, so you want to try to find a thing where you have your, that&rsquo;s a good, a good, a combination</p>
<p>of, of your, of the things that you&rsquo;re inherently good at, but you also like doing, um, and,</p>
<p>um,</p>
<p>And reading is a super fast shortcut to, to figure out which, where are you, you both</p>
<p>good at it.</p>
<p>You like doing it and it will actually have positive impact.</p>
<p>Well, you got to learn about things somehow.</p>
<p>So read, reading a broad range, just really read, read it.</p>
<p>You know, one point was that kid I read through the encyclopedia, uh, so that was pretty helpful.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, there are also things that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed a lot, so obviously</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like as broad as it gets.</p>
<p>Encyclopedias were digestible, I think, uh, you know, whatever, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Um, so, um, you know, maybe read through the, the condensed version of the encyclopedia</p>
<p>of Britannica.</p>
<p>And that, um, you can always like skip subjects or you read a few paragraphs and you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not interested, just jump to the next one.</p>
<p>That sort of read the encyclopedia or scan, skim, skim through it.</p>
<p>Um, and, um, but I, you know, I put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect</p>
<p>for someone who puts in an honest day&rsquo;s work, uh, to do useful things and, and just generally</p>
<p>to have like a, not a zero sum mindset, um, or, uh, like have, have more of a grow the</p>
<p>pie mindset.</p>
<p>Like the, if you, if you sort of say like when, when I see people like perhaps, um,</p>
<p>including some very smart people kind of taking an attitude of, uh, like, like, like doing</p>
<p>things that seem like morally questionable, it&rsquo;s often because they have at a base sort</p>
<p>of axiomatic level, a zero sum mindset.</p>
<p>Um, and, and they, without realizing it, they don&rsquo;t realize they have a zero sum mindset</p>
<p>or at least that they don&rsquo;t realize it consciously.</p>
<p>Um, and so if you have a zero sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking</p>
<p>things from others.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s like, if the, if the, if the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie</p>
<p>is to take someone else&rsquo;s pie.</p>
<p>But this is false.</p>
<p>Like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie.</p>
<p>Um, so the reality, in reality you can have the, so overuse this analogy, if you have</p>
<p>a lot of, there&rsquo;s a lot of pie, pie is not fixed.</p>
<p>Um, uh, so you really want to make sure you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not operating, um, without realizing</p>
<p>it from a zero sum mindset where, where the only way to get ahead is to take things from</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>And you take, try to take things from others, which is not, not good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much better to work on, uh, adding to the economic pie, maybe, you know, so creating,</p>
<p>like I said, create, creating more than you consume, uh, doing more than you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>Um, I think there&rsquo;s like, you know, a fair number of people in, in finance that, uh,</p>
<p>do have a bit of a zero sum mindset.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all walks of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that one of the, one of the reasons, uh, Rogan inspires me is he celebrates others</p>
<p>a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, not creating a constant competition.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a scarcity of resources.</p>
<p>What happens when you celebrate others and you promote others, the ideas of others, it,</p>
<p>it, uh, it actually grows that pie.</p>
<p>I mean, it, every, like the, uh, the resource, the resources become less scarce and that,</p>
<p>that applies in a lot of kinds of domains.</p>
<p>It applies in academia where a lot of people are very, uh, see some funding for academic</p>
<p>research is zero sum and it is not.</p>
<p>If you celebrate each other, if you make, if you get everybody to be excited about AI,</p>
<p>about physics, above mathematics, I think it, there&rsquo;ll be more and more funding and</p>
<p>I think everybody wins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That applies, I think broadly.</p>
<p>Uh,</p>
<p>yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So last, last question about love and meaning, uh, what is the role of love?</p>
<p>In the human condition, broadly and more specific to you, how has love, romantic love or otherwise</p>
<p>made you a better person, a better human being?</p>
<p>Better engineer?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re asking really perplexing questions.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s hard to give a, I mean, there are many books, poems and songs written about</p>
<p>what is love and what is, what exactly, you know, um, you know, what is love, baby don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hurt me.</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s one of the great ones.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve earlier quoted Shakespeare, but that that&rsquo;s really up there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Love is a many splinter thing.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean there&rsquo;s, um, it&rsquo;s cause we&rsquo;ve talked about so many inspiring things like be useful</p>
<p>in the world, sort of like solve problems, alleviate suffering, but it seems like connection</p>
<p>between humans is a source, you know, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a source of joys, a source of meaning</p>
<p>and that, that&rsquo;s what love is, friendship, love.</p>
<p>I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing where you talk about preserving the</p>
<p>light of human consciousness and us becoming a multi planetary, multi planetary species.</p>
<p>I mean, to me at least, um, that, that means like if we&rsquo;re just alone and conscious and</p>
<p>intelligent and it doesn&rsquo;t mean nearly as much as if we&rsquo;re with others, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some magic created when we&rsquo;re together, the, uh, the, the friendship of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I think the highest form of it is love, which I think broadly is, is much bigger than</p>
<p>just sort of romantic, but also yes, romantic love and, um, family and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about us becoming multi planet species in a space</p>
<p>frank civilization is foundationally, I love humanity, um, and, and so I wish to see it</p>
<p>prosper and do great things and be happy and, um, and if I did not love humanity, I would</p>
<p>not care about these things.</p>
<p>So when you look at the whole of it, the human history, all the people who&rsquo;s ever lived,</p>
<p>all the people live now, it&rsquo;s pretty, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&rsquo;re pretty interesting bunch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All things considered, and I&rsquo;ve read a lot of history, including the darkest, worst parts</p>
<p>of it, and, uh, despite all that, I think on balance, I still love humanity.</p>
<p>You joked about it with the 42, uh, what do you, what do you think is the meaning of this</p>
<p>whole thing?</p>
<p>Is like, is there a non numerical representation?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, really, I think what Douglas Adams was saying in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</p>
<p>is that, um, the universe is the answer and, uh, what we really need to figure out are</p>
<p>what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe and that the question is the</p>
<p>really the hard part.</p>
<p>And if you can properly frame the question, then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy.</p>
<p>Uh, so, so, so therefore, if you want to understand what questions to ask about the universe,</p>
<p>you want to understand the meaning of life, we need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re better able to understand the nature of the universe and, and understand</p>
<p>the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the most important part would be to ask the right question, thereby elevating</p>
<p>the role of the interviewer as the most important human in the room.</p>
<p>Good questions are, you know, it&rsquo;s a hard, it&rsquo;s hard to come up with good questions.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, like, it&rsquo;s like that, that is the foundation of my philosophy is that, um,</p>
<p>I am curious about the nature of the universe and, uh, you know, and obviously I will die.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll die, but I won&rsquo;t live forever.</p>
<p>Um, but I would like to know that we are on a path to understanding the nature of the</p>
<p>universe and the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is</p>
<p>the universe.</p>
<p>And, um, and so if we expand the scope and scale of humanity and consciousness in general,</p>
<p>um, which includes silicon consciousness, then that, you know, that, that, that seems</p>
<p>like a fundamentally good thing.</p>
<p>Elon, like I said, um, I&rsquo;m deeply grateful that you would spend your extremely valuable</p>
<p>time with me today and also that you have given millions of people hope in this difficult</p>
<p>time, this divisive time, in this, uh, cynical time.</p>
<p>So I hope you do continue doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Uh, thanks for your excellent questions.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Elon Musk himself.</p>
<p>When something is important enough, you do it, even if the odds are not in your favor.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
