    <p>The following is a conversation with Sergei Nazarov,</p>
<p>CEO of Chainlink, which is a decentralized Oracle network</p>
<p>that provides data to smart contracts.</p>
<p>He and his team have done seminal research</p>
<p>and engineering in the space of smart contracts.</p>
<p>Check out the Chainlink 2.0 white paper</p>
<p>that I found to be a great overview</p>
<p>of their technology and vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 136 pages, but very accessible.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,</p>
<p>and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description</p>
<p>to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that</p>
<p>externally connected smart contracts</p>
<p>that combine the ocean of data out there</p>
<p>with the security of the blockchain are fascinating to me,</p>
<p>both technically and philosophically.</p>
<p>Data is knowledge, and knowledge is power.</p>
<p>I think the more reliable data sources we integrate</p>
<p>into our decision making,</p>
<p>especially when those decisions are executed by programs,</p>
<p>the more efficient and productive our decisions become.</p>
<p>There are interactions between humans</p>
<p>that should not be formalized digitally,</p>
<p>like love, for example, but for all the others,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason for smart contracts</p>
<p>not to automate away the menial parts of life,</p>
<p>making more room for good conversation over brisket</p>
<p>and maybe some vodka with old and new friends.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Sergey Nazarov.</p>
<p>Is that Jozsik there?</p>
<p>So I gave away everything I own a few times in my life,</p>
<p>and he accidentally survived,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like stuffed animals.</p>
<p>What I really liked about, I got him in a thrift store.</p>
<p>What I liked about him is,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d never seen a stuffed animal</p>
<p>that looks pissed off at life.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re usually smiling in the dumbest of ways,</p>
<p>and this guy was just pissed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gotta tell you, that&rsquo;s actually pretty funny.</p>
<p>I like this guy.</p>
<p>If you had to live only in the digital world</p>
<p>or the physical world, which would you choose?</p>
<p>So I think this is actually a question</p>
<p>more about what the fidelity of the digital world would be</p>
<p>versus the physical world.</p>
<p>I think this type of question,</p>
<p>this whole simulation thing actually comes from papers</p>
<p>about 20, 30 years ago in the philosophical world</p>
<p>where people tried to make this thought experiment</p>
<p>of would you be comfortable</p>
<p>if everything that was happening to you</p>
<p>happened in a simulation?</p>
<p>What they were trying to do</p>
<p>is they were intuitively trying to understand</p>
<p>is there some kind of intuitive personal connection</p>
<p>we have to something being the real world, right?</p>
<p>And then the Matrix movie actually came out of these papers,</p>
<p>and then these ideas made their way</p>
<p>into the public consciousness.</p>
<p>I personally think that if I had the choice</p>
<p>to be in the digital world at the same fidelity</p>
<p>as the real world with immortality,</p>
<p>I would absolutely go with the digital.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you add the immortality part?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, you don&rsquo;t get immortality.</p>
<p>If you think about how we would go</p>
<p>into the digital world, right?</p>
<p>Our brain patterns would be mapped</p>
<p>onto some kind of probably virtual machine, right?</p>
<p>And that would mean immortality, right?</p>
<p>Because the virtual machine has no limit</p>
<p>to how long it can exist.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;ll be like a versioning system?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;ll be, this is a soft fork</p>
<p>versus hard fork question.</p>
<p>Whether Sergei version 2.0 would be different</p>
<p>from Sergei version 1.0, there&rsquo;ll be an upgrade.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a mortality.</p>
<p>Sergei 1.0 would die in the digital world.</p>
<p>And you get like a software update, and then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, when people go into the Star Trek transporter,</p>
<p>are they killed or are they transported?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written any papers on this.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really thought about it too much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no white paper on the transporter.</p>
<p>Not at this point, so.</p>
<p>Well, what does fidelity mean exactly to you?</p>
<p>Is it like strictly, so the fidelity of the physics world,</p>
<p>the physical world is maybe now questions of physics,</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, what is at the bottom of it all?</p>
<p>Or do you mean the fidelity of the actual experience?</p>
<p>Like the original state? It&rsquo;s just perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just perception.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s limited by human cognitive capabilities.</p>
<p>It is, but I don&rsquo;t really have anything else, right?</p>
<p>I think all of these papers</p>
<p>that brought up these questions of assimilation,</p>
<p>they were like in epistemology and metaphysics.</p>
<p>And what they were trying to do, I think,</p>
<p>was they were trying to put people</p>
<p>through a thought experiment</p>
<p>where they would come out on the other end</p>
<p>and say the reality of life is really worth something.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, you know, ignorance isn&rsquo;t bliss,</p>
<p>which is that consistent statement in the matrix, right?</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss is that that&rsquo;s what one of the guys says</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s like, you know, doing something wrong</p>
<p>and trying to get back into the matrix.</p>
<p>And the question is, is ignorance bliss?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a different version of that.</p>
<p>I think from a perceptual point of view,</p>
<p>if my perceptions aren&rsquo;t in any way different,</p>
<p>so fidelity is very good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>So if I don&rsquo;t know something, it doesn&rsquo;t really exist.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t exist in my perception</p>
<p>or my consciousness, then it doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>period, for me, at least.</p>
<p>And then whether it exists in some, you know,</p>
<p>more metaphysical version of things,</p>
<p>I personally never really got into the metaphysics stuff</p>
<p>because I could never really,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand what the point of it was, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these things where I couldn&rsquo;t really get</p>
<p>what the practical application of it was.</p>
<p>And this is from those realm of questions, right?</p>
<p>Like if there was something about the world,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t have a capacity to perceive it,</p>
<p>would it matter to you?</p>
<p>To me, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Right, to me, by the way, the simulation thing</p>
<p>is a really interesting engineering question,</p>
<p>which is how difficult is it to engineer a virtual reality,</p>
<p>a digital world that is sufficiently of high fidelity</p>
<p>where you would want to live in it?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really testable</p>
<p>and a fascinating engineering question.</p>
<p>So my intuition says like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as difficult as we think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not nearly as difficult as having to create</p>
<p>a quantum mechanical simulation that&rsquo;s large enough</p>
<p>to capture the full human experience.</p>
<p>Like it might be just as simple</p>
<p>as just a really nice quake game,</p>
<p>like with a nice engine,</p>
<p>with just creating all the basic visual elements</p>
<p>that trick our cognitive, our visual cortex</p>
<p>into believing that we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>in the physical environment.</p>
<p>And I think that if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s quite a high fidelity digital world</p>
<p>is actually achievable within a century.</p>
<p>And that changes things.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, maybe in our lifetime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really hoping for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping somebody can copy my brainwaves</p>
<p>onto a virtual machine and allow that consciousness</p>
<p>to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s death or not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s actually gonna require some serious leaps.</p>
<p>Like even the VR headsets, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t work if they go below 90 frame rates, right?</p>
<p>People start getting freaked out.</p>
<p>So you have to go from one gaming screen</p>
<p>of 60 frames per second</p>
<p>to two screens of 90 frames per second.</p>
<p>And so people&rsquo;s hardware today can&rsquo;t even handle that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for these two little screens by your eyeballs.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s gonna take to completely trick my consciousness</p>
<p>into not knowing the difference</p>
<p>in terms of like all the sensory inputs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Whoever does that and is close to doing that,</p>
<p>they should contact me.</p>
<p>I want to have my brainwaves turned into a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Would you in that context, if Morpheus came to you,</p>
<p>would you take the blue pill or the red pill?</p>
<p>Meaning, would you be happy just living in that world</p>
<p>and not knowing that you&rsquo;re living inside that virtual world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running a computer?</p>
<p>Or would you want to know the truth of it?</p>
<p>Well, actually I think that&rsquo;s a very different question,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a actually moral ethical question there</p>
<p>about whether you should allow a bunch of people</p>
<p>to get manipulated and killed and slaved,</p>
<p>because in the matrix they&rsquo;re all enslaved</p>
<p>as like a AAA battery</p>
<p>to turn a human being into the battery, right?</p>
<p>So I think the moral and ethical question of that,</p>
<p>fascinating enough, isn&rsquo;t actually different</p>
<p>than the moral and ethical questions we face today</p>
<p>in modern daily life.</p>
<p>But I probably have given the choice</p>
<p>of just completely going along or going against it.</p>
<p>I would probably go against it</p>
<p>if I had to make this kind of binary choice.</p>
<p>Because going along with it,</p>
<p>I think at that scale of scary stuff happening to people</p>
<p>is probably something really, really, really difficult.</p>
<p>But for your individual life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way more fun to go along with it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you value the opposing a system</p>
<p>that includes the suffering of others</p>
<p>versus just for yourself enjoying the ride.</p>
<p>I mean, if there is such a binary choice,</p>
<p>why choose to oppose the system?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the nature of kind of the ethical dilemma</p>
<p>that you face in that situation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of some,</p>
<p>this is obviously not something that&rsquo;s happening now, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know this, right?</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>at that scale of something like that happening,</p>
<p>yeah, that scale of people being manipulated and harmed,</p>
<p>then I think pretty much almost all people</p>
<p>have an obligation to go against it.</p>
<p>Probably that&rsquo;s what that looks like in my opinion.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about the concept of definitive truth.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And in general, what is the nature of truth</p>
<p>in human civilization?</p>
<p>And just talking about the digital age,</p>
<p>the nature of truth in the digital age.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing about definitive truth</p>
<p>is that it actually exists on this,</p>
<p>at least in my mind on this spectrum</p>
<p>between objective truth and just somebody made something up</p>
<p>and nobody else agrees.</p>
<p>So what I think definitive truth is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s somewhere in the middle on that spectrum</p>
<p>where if you and me define what truth is, right?</p>
<p>Like if you and me have an agreement of some kind</p>
<p>and we say, as long as the weather is sunny</p>
<p>or the weather isn&rsquo;t, there is no rain on that day,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;ll be an insurance policy that results</p>
<p>and you and me both agree that as long as three sensors,</p>
<p>three weather monitoring stations all say that,</p>
<p>then the definitive truth for us and for that agreement</p>
<p>is the result of those systems coming to consensus</p>
<p>about what happened out in the real world.</p>
<p>I think the objective truth definition</p>
<p>from kind of the philosophical world</p>
<p>is really, really stringent and very, very hard to attain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what this is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not what commerce</p>
<p>or the ability for people to interact about contracts needs.</p>
<p>What I think the world of commerce needs is an upgrade</p>
<p>from someone can unilaterally decide what the truth is</p>
<p>to there can be a pre agreed set of conditions</p>
<p>where we define what the truth is under those conditions.</p>
<p>And then you and me basically say,</p>
<p>if these 20 nodes or of these 30 data sources</p>
<p>come to consensus within this method of consensus</p>
<p>with this threshold of agreement,</p>
<p>then definitive truth has been achieved for you and me</p>
<p>in our relationship for this specific agreement</p>
<p>and the specificity and our shared agreement</p>
<p>to that kind of truth or that definitive truth</p>
<p>being acceptable to both of us is probably</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s kind of necessary and sufficient</p>
<p>for everything to move forward in a better way.</p>
<p>In any case, much better than,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bank or an insurance company,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna unilaterally decide what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely an upgrade from that.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to define formally in this way,</p>
<p>a definitive truth for many things in this world?</p>
<p>Like you talked about weather,</p>
<p>basically defining that if three sensors of weather agree,</p>
<p>then that we&rsquo;re going to agree that that is a definitive,</p>
<p>useful truth for us to operate under.</p>
<p>So how many things in this world</p>
<p>can be formalized in this way, do you think?</p>
<p>A huge amount.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually two things going on here.</p>
<p>One thing is the amount of data that already exists</p>
<p>and the pieces of data coming off of markets,</p>
<p>IOT, shipment of goods, any number of other things.</p>
<p>Like even your YouTube channel has a certain amount</p>
<p>of likes or a certain amount of clicks</p>
<p>or a certain amount of views</p>
<p>and even that&rsquo;s quantifiable.</p>
<p>So even to a certain degree, what we do here today,</p>
<p>you and me right now can be quantified</p>
<p>as far as the amount of views, the amount of clicks,</p>
<p>the amount of any number of other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, you, the viewer, have power of data in your hands</p>
<p>by clicking like or dislike right now</p>
<p>or the subscribe button or the unsubscribe button,</p>
<p>which I encourage you to do.</p>
<p>Anyway, okay, so there&rsquo;s data flowing</p>
<p>into all interactions in this world, there&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more and more data, right?</p>
<p>More and more data.</p>
<p>That data is more and more accessible to everybody</p>
<p>and that accessibility and the fact that there&rsquo;s more of it</p>
<p>means we can form more definitive truth proofs.</p>
<p>We can form more and more proofs</p>
<p>and as we form those proofs, well, we can provide them</p>
<p>to these blockchains and smart contract systems</p>
<p>that consume them and then they&rsquo;re tamper proof, right?</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t be manipulated.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;ve combined a system that can prove things</p>
<p>with a system that guarantees a certain outcomes</p>
<p>and we have a better system of contracts,</p>
<p>which is actually an unbelievably powerful tool</p>
<p>that has never existed before.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance,</p>
<p>decentralized finance?</p>
<p>What is it, what&rsquo;s its promise</p>
<p>from both the philosophical and technical perspective?</p>
<p>If we just zoom in on that particular space</p>
<p>of the digital world.</p>
<p>Sure, so the decentralized finance is the instantiation</p>
<p>of a specific type of smart contract, right?</p>
<p>Or what I call hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>which are these contracts that combine the on chain code</p>
<p>together with the off chain proofs that something happened.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called a hybrid</p>
<p>because they basically use both of these systems, right?</p>
<p>The blockchain and the proofs about what happened.</p>
<p>And what DeFi is, is one specific type</p>
<p>of hybrid smart contract that is taking</p>
<p>on the contractual agreements you traditionally find</p>
<p>in the global financial system, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically the world of lending,</p>
<p>the world of yield generation</p>
<p>for people giving me or giving whoever their money</p>
<p>and somebody giving back them yield back to them,</p>
<p>which is what bonds do and what treasuries do</p>
<p>and what a lot of the global financial markets do,</p>
<p>as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection</p>
<p>from different types of events and risks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of what derivatives do, right?</p>
<p>Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m either gonna protect myself</p>
<p>by getting paid if it happens,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to benefit from it happening</p>
<p>by basically saying it&rsquo;s gonna happen,</p>
<p>putting money down on that,</p>
<p>and that prediction will get me a return.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very large part</p>
<p>of the global financial system,</p>
<p>excluding all the stuff for global trade</p>
<p>and letters of credit and all the stuff</p>
<p>that facilitates international trade.</p>
<p>So excluding that at least for now.</p>
<p>So if we look at what decentralized finance does,</p>
<p>it takes all of those agreements</p>
<p>about generating yield, lending,</p>
<p>and all of these types of things you find in global finance</p>
<p>and the world of derivatives</p>
<p>and a few other types of financial products.</p>
<p>And it basically puts them into a different format, right?</p>
<p>So the format you have for centralized financial agreements</p>
<p>is that you go to a bank,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re a hedge fund,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re like the richest people,</p>
<p>you go to a bank, they make a product for you,</p>
<p>and you hope that they honor</p>
<p>the product that they made for you.</p>
<p>Or you do a deal with another hedge fund</p>
<p>or whoever, some counterparty,</p>
<p>and you hope that that deal is honored.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then a number of very freaky things start to take place.</p>
<p>One of them is people don&rsquo;t have clarity</p>
<p>about what the agreement is, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of people don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>what the agreement is between those parties</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t actually see it.</p>
<p>Sometimes agreements are kept very private</p>
<p>or parts of them are kept private.</p>
<p>And that keeps other counterparties,</p>
<p>other people in the system</p>
<p>from understanding what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>This is actually partly what happened</p>
<p>with the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p>The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically,</p>
<p>there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets,</p>
<p>but because the centralized financial system</p>
<p>worked in such an opaque way,</p>
<p>it was so unbelievably difficult</p>
<p>to understand what was going on, right?</p>
<p>And so that lack of understanding</p>
<p>for the global financial system</p>
<p>basically led to a big boom,</p>
<p>and then correspondingly, very, very big bust,</p>
<p>which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody,</p>
<p>even though they didn&rsquo;t participate</p>
<p>in the boom part of the equation.</p>
<p>In any case, what decentralized finance does</p>
<p>is it takes these financial contracts</p>
<p>that power the global financial system,</p>
<p>it puts them in this new blockchain based format</p>
<p>that basically at this point</p>
<p>provides three very powerful things.</p>
<p>The first thing that it provides is complete transparency</p>
<p>over what&rsquo;s going on with your financial product.</p>
<p>So this means when you use a financial product</p>
<p>in the DeFi format, you, and you as a technical person</p>
<p>actually can drill down very, very, very deeply,</p>
<p>and you can understand where the collateral is,</p>
<p>you can understand how much collateral there is,</p>
<p>you can understand what format it&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p>you can understand how it&rsquo;s changing,</p>
<p>you can understand this on a second to second</p>
<p>or block to block basis, right?</p>
<p>So you have complete transparency</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s going on in the financial protocol</p>
<p>that you have your assets in,</p>
<p>which is because blockchains and the infrastructure,</p>
<p>all of these things are built on, force that transparency.</p>
<p>Whereas the centralized financial system</p>
<p>is very, very good at hiding it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good at hiding it</p>
<p>and packaging things in a glossy wrapper,</p>
<p>creating a boom, then a bust.</p>
<p>The centralized finance is built on infrastructure</p>
<p>that forces transparency such that everyone can understand</p>
<p>what the financial product does from day one.</p>
<p>And in fact, escaping that property is practically impossible</p>
<p>or if someone tries to escape it,</p>
<p>it becomes immediately obvious</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t use their financial product.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Number two is control.</p>
<p>So if you look at what happened with Robinhood,</p>
<p>everybody thought the system worked a certain way, right?</p>
<p>Everybody thought I have a brokerage account,</p>
<p>I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions.</p>
<p>And then the market conditions changed</p>
<p>within the band of what people thought they could do.</p>
<p>And everybody was fascinated to find out that,</p>
<p>oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions</p>
<p>in which I can control my assets is X,</p>
<p>but it is actually Y,</p>
<p>is actually much, much smaller band.</p>
<p>And the reason it is a much, much smaller</p>
<p>group of market conditions</p>
<p>is that the system doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>the way people think it works.</p>
<p>The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper</p>
<p>and given to them to get them to participate in the system</p>
<p>because the system requires and needs their participation.</p>
<p>But if you actually look at how the system works underneath,</p>
<p>you will see that it does not work</p>
<p>the way people think that it works.</p>
<p>And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful</p>
<p>because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts,</p>
<p>give people the version of the world</p>
<p>they think they already have,</p>
<p>which is why they don&rsquo;t beg for it, right?</p>
<p>So everybody thinks they&rsquo;re in a certain version</p>
<p>of the world that works in this reliable way,</p>
<p>transparent way, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re confused when you tell them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make the world work this way</p>
<p>because they think they&rsquo;re already in that world.</p>
<p>But then things like Robinhood make it immediately,</p>
<p>painfully clear that that&rsquo;s not how the world works</p>
<p>so that the second real property of DeFi is control,</p>
<p>which means that you control your assets,</p>
<p>not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you.</p>
<p>You control your Bitcoins,</p>
<p>you control your tokens in the finance protocol.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like how something&rsquo;s going in that protocol,</p>
<p>you can remove it, you can send it to another protocol,</p>
<p>or you can use a feature of the protocol</p>
<p>to do something it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Nobody can just say, oops, that feature,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t so good for my friends over here.</p>
<p>That feature is actually,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna pause that feature in the critical moment</p>
<p>when you need it to execute your strategy,</p>
<p>which is why you took all the risks to begin with.</p>
<p>And then the final reason, the final thing to know about DeFi</p>
<p>is that DeFi is inherently global,</p>
<p>and actually right now provides better yield globally.</p>
<p>So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar,</p>
<p>you get 1% or less.</p>
<p>If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%.</p>
<p>So if we think about that in a world</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of inflation coming down the road,</p>
<p>and we think about, well, a lot more systems</p>
<p>might be failing soon,</p>
<p>and they might be highlighting these types of problems</p>
<p>that were there for, or as a result of the type of control</p>
<p>that you see in Robinhood,</p>
<p>and people are more and more concerned</p>
<p>about both transparency and control,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking for yield to combat inflation.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what DeFi is about in a practical sense.</p>
<p>It is this clarity about your risk.</p>
<p>It is control over your assets.</p>
<p>And amazingly, at the same time</p>
<p>as having those two unbelievably useful properties,</p>
<p>it is actually superior yield,</p>
<p>which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion</p>
<p>that the only reason DeFi is more used</p>
<p>is because more people don&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>And by virtue of this long kind of explanation</p>
<p>here and elsewhere, more people will know about it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such an obviously superior solution</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t heard a single explanation as to why.</p>
<p>No, no, don&rsquo;t earn 8% and take less risk</p>
<p>and have more transparency with your assets.</p>
<p>Earn 7% less, take more risk,</p>
<p>and give people the ability to change the rules on you</p>
<p>at their discretion, go do that.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna do that?</p>
<p>And in general, on the first two of transparency and control,</p>
<p>first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but from my perspective, they&rsquo;re deeply tied together</p>
<p>in the sense that transparency gives control.</p>
<p>Transparency creates accountability,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this kind of game being played,</p>
<p>game theoretic game, where if I know,</p>
<p>if you know I&rsquo;m gonna discover your deviation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna deviate.</p>
<p>Yes, this could be a whole nother conversation,</p>
<p>but just as a small aside,</p>
<p>on the social network side of things,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been thinking deeply about in the past year or so,</p>
<p>of how to do it right there, how to fix our social media.</p>
<p>And I tend to believe that human beings,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re given clear transparency</p>
<p>about which data is being stored, how it&rsquo;s being used,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s being moved about,</p>
<p>just all a clear, simple transparency</p>
<p>of how their data is being used,</p>
<p>and them having the control at the very minimal level</p>
<p>of being able to participate or to walk away,</p>
<p>and walk away means delete everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever known about me.</p>
<p>That will create a much, much better world.</p>
<p>That currently there&rsquo;s a complete lack of transparency</p>
<p>on social media, how the data is being used</p>
<p>for your own protection.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of parallels</p>
<p>to the central bank situation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a control element</p>
<p>of being able to walk away.</p>
<p>Like being able to delete all your data,</p>
<p>delete your account on Facebook is very difficult.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a single click,</p>
<p>which I think is what it should take.</p>
<p>There should be a big red button that says,</p>
<p>delete everything you&rsquo;ve ever known about me,</p>
<p>or like forget me.</p>
<p>So I think that coupled together can create</p>
<p>a very different kind of world and create</p>
<p>an incentivization that will lead to like progress</p>
<p>and innovation and just like a much better social network</p>
<p>and a really good business for the future social networks.</p>
<p>But so I tend to see like control as naturally</p>
<p>being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency.</p>
<p>It should all start at the transparency,</p>
<p>which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating.</p>
<p>Because like you&rsquo;re formalizing in a simple, clear way,</p>
<p>any agreements that you&rsquo;re participating in.</p>
<p>And as a side comment also, what&rsquo;s really inspiring to me</p>
<p>is that I think there&rsquo;s a greater,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is always the case,</p>
<p>but it seems like from having talked to people</p>
<p>on the psychological element,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hunger amongst people for transparency</p>
<p>and for control.</p>
<p>Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity.</p>
<p>If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now,</p>
<p>they want to know the reality of who you are</p>
<p>as an individual.</p>
<p>So that means you can create businesses,</p>
<p>you can create tools that are built on authenticity,</p>
<p>a transparency.</p>
<p>And then the same, I&rsquo;m inspired by the intelligence</p>
<p>of people, if you give them control,</p>
<p>if you give them power, that they would make good choices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>Of course, not everybody, but that means that</p>
<p>decentralized power can create effective systems.</p>
<p>So couple that, there&rsquo;s a hunger for transparency</p>
<p>so we can move to a world where everyone&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>just like real, conveying their genuine human nature.</p>
<p>And people are sufficiently intelligent</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re given power</p>
<p>in a distributed mass scale sense,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to build a better world through that,</p>
<p>as opposed to centralized supervised control</p>
<p>or only a small percent of the population</p>
<p>know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Everybody else is clueless sheep.</p>
<p>So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring.</p>
<p>Just to really quickly comment on this stuff</p>
<p>that you just said, which I think is super,</p>
<p>super, super fascinating.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all exactly right.</p>
<p>I think everything that you said is right.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually going to be the same</p>
<p>for social media and banking and every other type</p>
<p>of contract, is that all of those systems</p>
<p>that house people&rsquo;s value for them</p>
<p>and take control of either their social media value</p>
<p>or their financial value or whatever for them,</p>
<p>all of that is going to be made available to people</p>
<p>in like this autonomous piece of code</p>
<p>that does the same thing</p>
<p>that the centralized entity used to do.</p>
<p>So they get all the features,</p>
<p>but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability</p>
<p>to have control while getting all the features, right?</p>
<p>So banks give you features,</p>
<p>social media sites give you features,</p>
<p>whatever other system that you use online</p>
<p>gives you features, and then it takes your data</p>
<p>and it takes control of your assets from you</p>
<p>in return for those features, right?</p>
<p>I think the whole big difference here,</p>
<p>partly in line with the definition of smart contracts</p>
<p>and its evolution is that there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s this autonomous piece of code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving you all those features</p>
<p>without requiring the ownership and lock in and control</p>
<p>and unilateral kind of ownership of your data</p>
<p>or your value or whatever it is that you&rsquo;re giving it, right?</p>
<p>And I think what this will lead to fundamentally</p>
<p>is just more of a free market dynamic</p>
<p>among how people make,</p>
<p>I think with the social media folks,</p>
<p>you should just make some kind of law or something</p>
<p>where you can just export all your data from them,</p>
<p>everyone should be able to get their data exported</p>
<p>by another application,</p>
<p>and then the network effect of all these social media sites</p>
<p>will kind of crumble</p>
<p>because people will just combine your Twitter data</p>
<p>with your Facebook data, with everything else</p>
<p>into an application that you control,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll just be thousands of different interfaces</p>
<p>competing for how to consume all the social media data</p>
<p>because it isn&rsquo;t locked in</p>
<p>in one centralized actor&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>And so this is just the recurring pattern</p>
<p>of what I think all of this will do</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;ll give people, it gives people a better deal, right?</p>
<p>It gives them features without ownership of data,</p>
<p>without ownership of value,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really the difference.</p>
<p>So I think this is a good place</p>
<p>to talk about smart contracts then.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the history of smart contracts</p>
<p>and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?</p>
<p>Sure, so I think smart contracts as a definition</p>
<p>has actually gone through some kind of changes</p>
<p>or small evolution.</p>
<p>Initially, I think it was actually a conception</p>
<p>of a digital agreement that was tamper proof</p>
<p>and could know things about the world, right?</p>
<p>So it could get proof</p>
<p>and it could define that something happened</p>
<p>and it could conclude an outcome</p>
<p>and release payment or do something else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the definition of smart contracts</p>
<p>that I began working in this industry with</p>
<p>seven or eight years ago</p>
<p>when I started making smart contracts.</p>
<p>That is the conception that I had of a smart contract.</p>
<p>Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?</p>
<p>Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement</p>
<p>that could also know things about the real world</p>
<p>and release payments back to people about those events</p>
<p>that were codified in this tamper proof format</p>
<p>was actually a very tall order.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s consistent of three parts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consisting of the contract,</p>
<p>the proof about what happened</p>
<p>and the release of value.</p>
<p>The way things have evolved so far</p>
<p>is that the definition has now come to mean on chain code.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s come to mean the codification</p>
<p>of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some code somewhere on some blockchain</p>
<p>that defines what the agreement is.</p>
<p>Now that eliminates the part of the definition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to knowing things about the world</p>
<p>and it partly eliminates the definition about payments</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But basically it&rsquo;s on chain code, right?</p>
<p>We in our recent work on a second white paper</p>
<p>have actually put out a different definition</p>
<p>that we call hybrid smart contracts</p>
<p>that actually tries to go back to the initial definition</p>
<p>that I started with seven or eight years ago,</p>
<p>which basically says that there&rsquo;s some proof somewhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s proven to the contract</p>
<p>and the contract can know that</p>
<p>and the contract can gain proof.</p>
<p>Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s codified on a blockchain.</p>
<p>So you both need a mechanism to provide proof.</p>
<p>You need a mechanism to codify the contract</p>
<p>in a tamper proof way on something like a blockchain.</p>
<p>And then as with all contracts,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a presumption that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some kind of release of value.</p>
<p>So I think a smart contract in our industry right now</p>
<p>means on chain code,</p>
<p>which limits it to whatever can be done on chain only.</p>
<p>And then in our internal definition for us</p>
<p>and for us at Chainlink and for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>which is actually the original definition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that a contract can both know what happened</p>
<p>and automatically resolve to the proper outcome</p>
<p>based on what happened.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper,</p>
<p>which is a paper that I recommend people look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very easy read and very well structured</p>
<p>and very thorough.</p>
<p>So I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Very recently released, I guess.</p>
<p>Can you dig in deeper?</p>
<p>What is a hybrid smart contract?</p>
<p>You mentioned sort of this idea of data</p>
<p>or knowing about the world and on chain and off chain.</p>
<p>So what are the different roles in this?</p>
<p>So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s on chain and off chain contracts.</p>
<p>So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it</p>
<p>and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?</p>
<p>Like how do you actually achieve that?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the smart contract itself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you codify certain conditions,</p>
<p>such as the conditions under which an interest payment</p>
<p>is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out</p>
<p>the full amount that it holds to someone based</p>
<p>on a derivative outcome or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, what the on chain code is very good at</p>
<p>is creating transparency about what the core conditions</p>
<p>of the contract are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good at taking in money from other private keys</p>
<p>that send it tokens and send it value to hold.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also very good at returning money</p>
<p>or returning value back to other addresses</p>
<p>or other private keys.</p>
<p>It can also be involved in governance.</p>
<p>It can be involved in a few other private key signature</p>
<p>based operations.</p>
<p>But primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract,</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far, defines the agreement,</p>
<p>takes in value and returns value based upon the conditions</p>
<p>codified in the agreement on a blockchain.</p>
<p>The second and equally important off chain part</p>
<p>is where the term oracle and an oracle comes in</p>
<p>or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>as we describe it in the paper.</p>
<p>And this is another decentralized computational system</p>
<p>that has a different goal, right?</p>
<p>So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions</p>
<p>into blocks and connecting them</p>
<p>in a cryptographically unique way to create security</p>
<p>and assurance about that chain of transactions.</p>
<p>Oracles and decentralized oracle networks</p>
<p>achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization</p>
<p>about the topic of what happened, right?</p>
<p>So blockchains structure transactions.</p>
<p>Some of those transactions might be the state changes</p>
<p>in different pieces of on chain code.</p>
<p>And then those on chain pieces of code require input.</p>
<p>I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit</p>
<p>thrown by is despite being called smart contracts,</p>
<p>the on chain code on a blockchain</p>
<p>cannot actually speak to any other system.</p>
<p>So blockchains are valuable and useful</p>
<p>as far as they&rsquo;re tamper proof and secure.</p>
<p>And to be tamper proof and secure,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re made this kind of walled garden</p>
<p>that is able to know and interact</p>
<p>only with the highly reliable information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within that system,</p>
<p>which is basically tokens and private key signatures.</p>
<p>All the other world&rsquo;s information is not available</p>
<p>in a blockchain inherently.</p>
<p>And a smart contract or a piece of on chain code</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just say, hey, I&rsquo;m gonna go get some data</p>
<p>from over here because the API they would get it from</p>
<p>creates a whole bunch of security concerns</p>
<p>for the blockchain itself</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of consensus issues</p>
<p>about how to agree on what that API said</p>
<p>or what the truth of the world is, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not even agreeing on what one API said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more so creating a reliable</p>
<p>form of decentralized computation</p>
<p>that can give you a definitive proof of what happened</p>
<p>and not just what one API said.</p>
<p>So for example, some of our most widely used networks</p>
<p>have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources</p>
<p>that are all providing information</p>
<p>about the same type of data.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s consensus on that one piece of data,</p>
<p>which is then written in and essentially given back</p>
<p>into the on chain code to tell it what happened</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t really make an agreement</p>
<p>unless you know what happened, right?</p>
<p>If you and me were to make an agreement</p>
<p>and set some contractual conditions,</p>
<p>but our agreement could never know what happened,</p>
<p>it would be completely useless.</p>
<p>However, if you and me made an agreement</p>
<p>and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism</p>
<p>or decentralized Oracle network</p>
<p>that proved what happened definitively</p>
<p>and you and me pre agreed</p>
<p>that whatever this mechanism says is what happened,</p>
<p>then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation.</p>
<p>We can suddenly say, there&rsquo;s this piece of on chain code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s highly reliable.</p>
<p>We can give it millions, billions,</p>
<p>eventually trillions of dollars in value.</p>
<p>And it is controlled by this other system over here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also highly reliable</p>
<p>under this configurable set of definitive truth</p>
<p>and decentralization conditions,</p>
<p>which we all agree are sufficiently stringent</p>
<p>to control that much value.</p>
<p>And therefore the combination</p>
<p>of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract</p>
<p>and this mutually agreed upon definition</p>
<p>of a trigger or a proof system combined</p>
<p>is a hybrid smart contract,</p>
<p>which as you can see probably already</p>
<p>does a lot more than just a contract on chain, right?</p>
<p>Can you talk about this consensus mechanism,</p>
<p>which by the way is just fascinating.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the on chain consensus mechanism</p>
<p>of proof of work and proof of stake.</p>
<p>And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism</p>
<p>of what is true.</p>
<p>So how do you, can you compare the two?</p>
<p>Like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?</p>
<p>How do you achieve security</p>
<p>in integrating data about the world</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s definitively true</p>
<p>in a way that is usefully true,</p>
<p>such that we can rely on it in making major agreements</p>
<p>that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>Right, so this is the challenging,</p>
<p>this is the challenging question, right?</p>
<p>This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks,</p>
<p>Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on</p>
<p>in order to create this definitive truth</p>
<p>to trigger and create hyper automation</p>
<p>in this more advanced form,</p>
<p>more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts.</p>
<p>The reality I think of this problem</p>
<p>is that it is very specific to each use case.</p>
<p>And it, and this is actually how we&rsquo;ve architected our system</p>
<p>is in a very flexible way.</p>
<p>So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network</p>
<p>to grow in the amount of nodes that it has</p>
<p>relative to the value it secures, right?</p>
<p>So if you have an Oracle network</p>
<p>that secures a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p>in like a beta of a financial product,</p>
<p>maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes</p>
<p>and only two or three data sources, right?</p>
<p>Because the risk to that Oracle network</p>
<p>is relatively low based on the value it secures.</p>
<p>So the first question is actually</p>
<p>how do you scale security relative to value</p>
<p>secured by that Oracle network?</p>
<p>Because it wouldn&rsquo;t be very efficient</p>
<p>to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value.</p>
<p>So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale</p>
<p>and how do we compose ensembles of nodes</p>
<p>in a decentralized way where we can know that,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re going from seven nodes in a network</p>
<p>to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one dimension of the problem.</p>
<p>So you have to be scaling the number of nodes</p>
<p>relative to the value that&rsquo;s derived</p>
<p>from the truth integrated into those nodes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not the only problem, right?</p>
<p>The other side of this is that you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>a deterministic result, a deterministic output</p>
<p>from a set of non deterministic disparate systems,</p>
<p>data sources, or places that prove things.</p>
<p>Can you also, just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?</p>
<p>What is the role of an Oracle node?</p>
<p>Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists in both places,</p>
<p>it exists in both worlds.</p>
<p>It exists as an on chain contract</p>
<p>that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an on chain interface in the form of a contract</p>
<p>that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs.</p>
<p>You can request weather data from me,</p>
<p>you can request price data from me,</p>
<p>you can ask me to send a payment somewhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an API, so it&rsquo;s a pointer to a API</p>
<p>that provides truth about this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interface, so just like an API</p>
<p>is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers,</p>
<p>Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them</p>
<p>or individual nodes are the interface</p>
<p>of Web 3.0&rsquo;s use of services.</p>
<p>And services includes all services,</p>
<p>data, payment systems, messaging systems,</p>
<p>whatever Web 2.0 or any kind of computing service</p>
<p>that you can conceptualize,</p>
<p>needs an interface on chain in the form of a contract</p>
<p>that says, here are the services I can provide for you,</p>
<p>here are the transactions you need to send me</p>
<p>to get back this data or that computation or this result.</p>
<p>And then what you actually see</p>
<p>is that decentralized Oracle networks,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re uniquely capable of generating</p>
<p>their own computations in a decentralized way</p>
<p>around the data that they have access to,</p>
<p>you actually see decentralized Oracle networks</p>
<p>generating a lot of these services.</p>
<p>So for example, we have a randomness service,</p>
<p>a verifiable randomness function service</p>
<p>that basically provides randomness on chain</p>
<p>and that randomness is then used in lotteries</p>
<p>and various other contracts that need randomness.</p>
<p>But that randomness, it&rsquo;s not a piece of data</p>
<p>that comes from somewhere else.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t go to another data source and get it.</p>
<p>We generate it within an Oracle node</p>
<p>that then provides it over into Oracle node</p>
<p>or Oracle nodes that provide it</p>
<p>into the contracts themselves.</p>
<p>So why do you say Oracle nodes are non deterministic?</p>
<p>Well, they are as far as they come to consensus,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this kind of different problem here, right?</p>
<p>The blockchains are very focused</p>
<p>on generating blocks of transactions</p>
<p>within a smaller universe of transaction types,</p>
<p>a certain block size and a certain set of conditions.</p>
<p>And then they have a economic system that says,</p>
<p>I will perpetually generate blocks of this size</p>
<p>with these transaction types in this kind of limited set</p>
<p>of transaction types, whether those are UTXO transactions</p>
<p>or scripted solidity or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Oracles and Oracle networks,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a blockchain, for example.</p>
<p>There is no chain link blockchain.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to generate a certain set</p>
<p>of very clearly predetermined transaction types</p>
<p>into a set of transactions that are put into blocks</p>
<p>and it will infinitely be done that way.</p>
<p>Our goal is actually to create what we call a Meta layer,</p>
<p>a decentralized Meta layer between the non deterministic,</p>
<p>highly unreliable world</p>
<p>and the highly hyper reliable world of blockchains</p>
<p>so that the unreliable world can be passed</p>
<p>through this decentralized Meta layer.</p>
<p>And it can coexist with a reliable on chain world.</p>
<p>Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases,</p>
<p>the Meta layer might generate it.</p>
<p>So the problem in giving you this straight answer</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s just such a wide array of services.</p>
<p>If you were to say,</p>
<p>well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness</p>
<p>from a data source?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t use a data source to generate the randomness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the type of service that can be generated</p>
<p>in an Oracle network itself.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;ll be certain computations</p>
<p>that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves</p>
<p>to augment and improve blockchains.</p>
<p>And it is actually the goal of Oracles</p>
<p>to consistently do that.</p>
<p>So if you were to think about the stack</p>
<p>in a very generic high level,</p>
<p>you would see blockchains or databases.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically the data structures</p>
<p>that retain a lot of information</p>
<p>in this transparent, highly reliable form.</p>
<p>Smart contract code is the application logic.</p>
<p>It is the logic under which all of this</p>
<p>kind of activity occurs,</p>
<p>storing data in the data structure in the blockchain</p>
<p>as a database in a certain conceptualization of it.</p>
<p>And then Oracles and Oracle networks</p>
<p>are all the services that are used by the application code.</p>
<p>So, you know, by analogy, let&rsquo;s take Uber.</p>
<p>Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API</p>
<p>from Google Maps about the user&rsquo;s location,</p>
<p>sends a message to the user through Twilio,</p>
<p>pays the driver through Stripe.</p>
<p>If those services weren&rsquo;t available</p>
<p>to the people who made Uber,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have made Uber, right?</p>
<p>Because they would have written their core code</p>
<p>on some database,</p>
<p>and then they would have had to make a geolocation company,</p>
<p>a telecom messaging company,</p>
<p>and the global payments company.</p>
<p>And they wouldn&rsquo;t have done that because it&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the weird scenario</p>
<p>that a lot of people in our industry are in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix</p>
<p>is they provide these decentralized services</p>
<p>to take this developer ecosystem,</p>
<p>the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem</p>
<p>from, hey, I can have a database</p>
<p>and write some application logic</p>
<p>about tokenization and voting and private key signing,</p>
<p>all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation.</p>
<p>But now, if you just layer on all the world&rsquo;s services,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s market data, weather data, randomness,</p>
<p>suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming,</p>
<p>fraud proof global trade, fraud proof ad networks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why this world of decentralized services</p>
<p>and decentralized Oracle networks</p>
<p>is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And you talk about the currents of a decentralized world,</p>
<p>decentralized world, DeFi,</p>
<p>but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically just financial transactions.</p>
<p>And the kind of thing, the reason why it&rsquo;s super exciting,</p>
<p>the kind of thing you do with Chainlink and Oracle networks</p>
<p>is that you can basically open up</p>
<p>the whole world of services</p>
<p>to this kind of decentralized smart contract world.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about just orders of magnitude</p>
<p>greater impact financially</p>
<p>and just socially and philosophically.</p>
<p>Are there interesting near term</p>
<p>and long term applications that excite you?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot that excites me.</p>
<p>And that is how I think about it,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>we made a decentralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about we made a decentralized service</p>
<p>or collection of services</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going from hundreds to thousands.</p>
<p>And then people are able to build</p>
<p>the hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>which I think will redefine what our industry is about.</p>
<p>Because for example, for the people</p>
<p>that only learned about blockchains</p>
<p>through the lens of NFTs,</p>
<p>they understand blockchains through NFTs,</p>
<p>not through speculative tokens or Bitcoins, right?</p>
<p>And I think that will continue.</p>
<p>I think the use cases that excite me,</p>
<p>they vary between the developed market,</p>
<p>the developed world&rsquo;s economies and emerging markets.</p>
<p>I think in the developed world,</p>
<p>what you will see is that transparency,</p>
<p>creating a new level of information</p>
<p>for how markets work and the risk that is in markets</p>
<p>and kind of the dynamics that put</p>
<p>the global financial system</p>
<p>at systemic financial risk like 2008.</p>
<p>And my hope is that all of this infrastructure</p>
<p>will soften the boom and bust cycles</p>
<p>by making information immediately available</p>
<p>to all market participants,</p>
<p>which is by the way, what all market participants want,</p>
<p>except for the very, very, very small minority</p>
<p>that are able to game the system and their benefit</p>
<p>and benefit from booms but avoid busts</p>
<p>because of their asymmetric access to information,</p>
<p>which really everybody should have</p>
<p>and which this technically solves.</p>
<p>I think in the process of doing that</p>
<p>and which is happening, I think right about now,</p>
<p>you see a polishing of the technology</p>
<p>such that it can be made available to emerging markets.</p>
<p>And on a personal level,</p>
<p>I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more</p>
<p>from this technology,</p>
<p>just like the emerging markets benefit much more</p>
<p>from the internet or from those $50 Android phones</p>
<p>that people can have,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a massive shift</p>
<p>in how people&rsquo;s lives work, right?</p>
<p>I have always had access to books and a library,</p>
<p>which has been fantastic and very important.</p>
<p>But there are places in the world</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t have libraries,</p>
<p>but now they have the internet and a $50 Android phone</p>
<p>and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I watch.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of mind blowing realistically, right?</p>
<p>They just went from zero to one in a very,</p>
<p>very dramatic way.</p>
<p>I think all of these smart contracts,</p>
<p>and in my case, I think the one</p>
<p>that I seem to keep coming back to is crop insurance,</p>
<p>where partly because it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a tokenization component,</p>
<p>partly because it&rsquo;s actually much more important</p>
<p>than it might seem.</p>
<p>What is crop insurance?</p>
<p>Right, so this is the nature of why it&rsquo;s sometimes hard</p>
<p>to see the full value of what our industry does,</p>
<p>because it solves all these kinds of backend problems</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have, right?</p>
<p>So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn&rsquo;t rain,</p>
<p>I get an insurance payout,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t need to close down my farm,</p>
<p>because if it didn&rsquo;t rain, I don&rsquo;t have crops, right?</p>
<p>So people in the developed world can get crop insurance</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of systems</p>
<p>that basically pay them out,</p>
<p>and then they can argue with the insurance company</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t get paid out properly and whatever.</p>
<p>And this allows people to smooth out risk.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the global options markets</p>
<p>were about this, right?</p>
<p>They were initially about people selling their produce</p>
<p>or their crops ahead of time,</p>
<p>so that if there was a risk of drought,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t impacted by it, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where a lot of options trading</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff came from,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s now turned into this kind of global casino.</p>
<p>But in the emerging market,</p>
<p>there are literally people that,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have rain for two seasons,</p>
<p>they need to close down their farm</p>
<p>and become a migrant worker of some kind.</p>
<p>And now they have a $50 Android phone</p>
<p>where they can read Wikipedia,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still decades away from an insurance company</p>
<p>coming to their geography and offering them insurance</p>
<p>because their local legal system simply doesn&rsquo;t allow</p>
<p>that type of thing to exist.</p>
<p>No insurance company is gonna go and create insurance entity</p>
<p>and offer them insurance because the levels of fraud</p>
<p>and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts</p>
<p>would just not exist.</p>
<p>So now these people have to wait for decades</p>
<p>to have this very basic form of financial protection</p>
<p>or something like a bank account even.</p>
<p>And with this technology, they don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone</p>
<p>and the smart contract has data from satellites</p>
<p>or weather stations about the weather conditions</p>
<p>in the geography that my farm is in,</p>
<p>I can put value into the smart contract</p>
<p>and the smart contract will automatically pay me out back,</p>
<p>pay me back out at my Android phone.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government</p>
<p>not being able to provide a legal infrastructure</p>
<p>to create insurance.</p>
<p>I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll probably price gouge me and often not pay out.</p>
<p>And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper reliable</p>
<p>kind of guaranteed smart contract outcomes</p>
<p>that are as good or in many cases better</p>
<p>than what farmers in all parts of other parts</p>
<p>of the world have.</p>
<p>And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets</p>
<p>of creating a way for people to control and manage risk</p>
<p>in their economic life, I think extends way past insurance.</p>
<p>It extends to them having bank accounts</p>
<p>to combat local inflation.</p>
<p>It extends to them being able to sell their goods</p>
<p>on the free market of global trade without middlemen.</p>
<p>It extends to all these things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really care about, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not farmers,</p>
<p>but are unbelievably impactful for people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a bank account</p>
<p>and their inflation rate in their country is double digits</p>
<p>or their farm completely depends on rain</p>
<p>or their livelihood completely depends</p>
<p>on their ability to sell goods.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t sell those goods because there&rsquo;s a middleman</p>
<p>who essentially controls all the trust relationships.</p>
<p>But now we have the internet and smart contracts</p>
<p>and that might not have to be the case</p>
<p>in the next five or 10 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that definitely has a quality of life impact</p>
<p>on the particular farmer&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>but I suspect it has a huge like down the line ripple effect</p>
<p>on the whole supply chain.</p>
<p>So if you think about farmers,</p>
<p>but any other people that produce things</p>
<p>that are part of a large like logistics network,</p>
<p>like supply chain network,</p>
<p>that means when you increase reliability,</p>
<p>you sort of increase transparency and control,</p>
<p>but like where any one node in that supply chain network</p>
<p>can formalize the way it operates</p>
<p>in its agreements with others,</p>
<p>then you could just have a very like at scale</p>
<p>transformative effect on how people that down the line</p>
<p>use the services that you provide,</p>
<p>the products that you create operate.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s almost hard to imagine</p>
<p>the possible ways it might transform the world.</p>
<p>I wonder how much friction there is in the system,</p>
<p>I guess, currently that smart contracts might remove.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost unknown.</p>
<p>You can sort of hypothesize and stuff, but I wonder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough bureaucracy in my life</p>
<p>to know that smart contracts in many cases</p>
<p>would remove bureaucracy.</p>
<p>And I wonder how the world will be</p>
<p>once you remove much of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Coming from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>where I just have seen the life sucked out</p>
<p>of the innovative spirit of human nature by bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I wonder, the kind of amazing world that could be created</p>
<p>once bureaucracy is removed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s fascinating how the world can evolve.</p>
<p>I think this extends a lot further than people think</p>
<p>into many, many different parts of the global economy.</p>
<p>It might start with NFTs for art,</p>
<p>or it might start with DeFi, right?</p>
<p>Or it might start with fraud proof ad networks next.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s gonna go to next,</p>
<p>but I think the implication of people being</p>
<p>in a system of contracts that holds them accountable</p>
<p>and guarantees contractual outcomes,</p>
<p>regardless of a local legal system,</p>
<p>is something that I think extends to the supply chain.</p>
<p>You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way,</p>
<p>and you can prove that in a way that can&rsquo;t be gamed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll change buying power and supplier power</p>
<p>and how people produce goods that we all consume.</p>
<p>And then on the political level,</p>
<p>I personally think that in a number of decades,</p>
<p>we could literally be in a place</p>
<p>where politicians can commit</p>
<p>to a certain set of smart contract kind of budget,</p>
<p>definitional kind of results.</p>
<p>For example, we discovered oil.</p>
<p>I promise as a politician, I&rsquo;m gonna take the oil</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna redistribute it to all of you.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Sounds very nice when you&rsquo;re running for office.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we codify that in a smart contract?</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t we put those conditions</p>
<p>very solidly on a blockchain?</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;ve been elected,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just turn that one on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll distribute the money just like you said,</p>
<p>and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>I personally think that this new level of systems</p>
<p>that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody,</p>
<p>between supply chain partners, ad network users,</p>
<p>the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers,</p>
<p>all of these are just interactions</p>
<p>that require a trusted entity,</p>
<p>or in this case, a trusted piece of code</p>
<p>to orchestrate the interaction</p>
<p>in the way that everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the things that makes the United States</p>
<p>fascinating is the founding documents.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to think of us moving into the new</p>
<p>in the 21st century to a digital version of that.</p>
<p>So the constitution, a smart constitution,</p>
<p>no offense to the paper constitution,</p>
<p>and that would have transformative effects</p>
<p>on politicians and governments,</p>
<p>holding people accountable.</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s so exciting to think that</p>
<p>we might enforce accountability</p>
<p>through the smart contract process.</p>
<p>Exactly, why can&rsquo;t that happen?</p>
<p>Anything that we could codify into a smart contract,</p>
<p>and anything that we all agree</p>
<p>is the way the world should work.</p>
<p>And then anything that we can get proof about, right?</p>
<p>Anything that a system somewhere could tell us happened,</p>
<p>those are the pieces of the puzzle, right?</p>
<p>We need a trusted piece of code,</p>
<p>we need to have agreement</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s how the world should work,</p>
<p>and we need a system that&rsquo;ll tell that trusted piece</p>
<p>of code what happened.</p>
<p>As long as we have those three things,</p>
<p>we can theoretically codify any set of agreements</p>
<p>about anything where those three properties take hold.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could apply that</p>
<p>to like military conflict and so on.</p>
<p>Recently, Biden announced that we&rsquo;re going to pull off</p>
<p>from Afghanistan after 20 years in the war.</p>
<p>I wonder, there&rsquo;s a lot of debacles around war in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and invasion of Iraq, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract.</p>
<p>Like that might have actually huge impact</p>
<p>on the way we do conflict.</p>
<p>So you think of the smart contract</p>
<p>as a kind of win win situation where you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>like financial transactions or something like that.</p>
<p>But you could see that also about military conflict</p>
<p>or like whenever two nations are at tension with each other,</p>
<p>different scales of conflict,</p>
<p>that you can have conflict codified.</p>
<p>And that would potentially resolve conflict much faster</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s honesty, transparency and control</p>
<p>within that conflict, because there&rsquo;s conflict in this world.</p>
<p>And I, again, very, very inspiring to think</p>
<p>about the kind of effects it might have</p>
<p>on the negative kinds of contracts,</p>
<p>on the tense, painful kinds of contracts.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about that as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of scary,</p>
<p>the stuff you&rsquo;re thinking through now</p>
<p>with like the war contracts or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not in the white paper.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anything about war contracts or anything.</p>
<p>Again, this is the Russian, we&rsquo;re both Russian,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a little more Russian in the suffering side.</p>
<p>Maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky</p>
<p>and military kind of ideas.</p>
<p>But anyway, holding politicians accountable in all forms,</p>
<p>I think is really powerful.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say as a small aside</p>
<p>on how smart contracts actually work if we look at the code?</p>
<p>Is there some nice way to say technically</p>
<p>what is a smart contract?</p>
<p>What does it mean to codify these agreements,</p>
<p>the actual process for people</p>
<p>who might not at all be familiar?</p>
<p>I think you just write it into code</p>
<p>that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure.</p>
<p>You usually write code</p>
<p>that runs in a central server somewhere.</p>
<p>Now you write code that runs across a lot</p>
<p>of different machines in this decentralized way.</p>
<p>And then after you write it, you need services.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where oracles come in,</p>
<p>they provide all the services.</p>
<p>So just like you would be writing code in web 2.0 land,</p>
<p>running it on a server somewhere</p>
<p>and using an API, here you&rsquo;d be writing code,</p>
<p>putting it on a decentralized infrastructure</p>
<p>like a blockchain or a smart contract platform like Ethereum.</p>
<p>And then you would be using various services</p>
<p>in the form of oracles.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll just be called oracles</p>
<p>or decentralized services instead of APIs.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re basically composing the same type of architecture</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s hyper reliable.</p>
<p>At the moment, it&rsquo;s a little bit less efficient</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an early stage to our industry.</p>
<p>But it provides this extreme level of reliability</p>
<p>and transparency, which for certain use cases</p>
<p>is an absolute critical component</p>
<p>and is completely reinventing how they work.</p>
<p>So I think people should look at what are the use cases</p>
<p>where that trust dynamic can be so heavily improved.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the ones</p>
<p>where this is maybe initially useful.</p>
<p>But I mean, just to emphasize,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize when you say code</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about non obfuscated actual program.</p>
<p>Like you can read it, you can understand it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>maybe this is my computer science perspective</p>
<p>of like software engineering perspective,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the formalism</p>
<p>of programming languages, which enforces simplicity</p>
<p>and clarity and transparency.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s seen to everybody,</p>
<p>I mean, simplicity is enforced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about natural language,</p>
<p>like language as written in the constitution, for example,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so many interpretations.</p>
<p>With the nice thing about programs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be a huge number of books written</p>
<p>about what was meant by this particular line</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty clear.</p>
<p>Like programming languages have a clarity to them</p>
<p>that natural language does not,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have ambiguity, which I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to pause on because it&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to think about.</p>
<p>I think we live in a world where all the philosophers</p>
<p>and legal minds don&rsquo;t know how to program.</p>
<p>So I think, not all, most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t often see the philosophical impact</p>
<p>of this kind of idea that the agreements</p>
<p>between humans can be written in a programming language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really transformative idea.</p>
<p>That, I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s an idea that&rsquo;s not just technical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just financial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s philosophical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rethinking human nature from a digital perspective.</p>
<p>Like what is human civilization?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interaction between humans.</p>
<p>And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction</p>
<p>that is managed by programming languages,</p>
<p>by programs, by code.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ll look back at this time potentially</p>
<p>as one where us little descendants of apes</p>
<p>did not realize how important this moment in history is.</p>
<p>Like human beings might be totally different</p>
<p>a century from now because we codified</p>
<p>the interaction between humans.</p>
<p>That might have more of an impact than anything else</p>
<p>we do today.</p>
<p>You think about the impact of the internet,</p>
<p>one of the cool things is digitization of data.</p>
<p>But we have not yet integrated the tools,</p>
<p>the mechanisms fully that use that data</p>
<p>and interact with humans yet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what smart contracts do.</p>
<p>I wonder if you think about the role</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence in all of this.</p>
<p>Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements,</p>
<p>maybe you disagree with this,</p>
<p>but at least the way I&rsquo;m thinking about it</p>
<p>is agreements between humans or groups of humans.</p>
<p>But it seems like because everything&rsquo;s operating</p>
<p>in the digital space that you can integrate</p>
<p>non humans into this.</p>
<p>Or AI systems that help out humans,</p>
<p>managed by humans.</p>
<p>Like what do you think about a world</p>
<p>of hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>codifying agreements between hybrid</p>
<p>intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>In terms of AI, I&rsquo;m not an expert, right?</p>
<p>So it might be a bit simplistic or naive,</p>
<p>my ideas in this field.</p>
<p>I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?</p>
<p>Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s.</p>
<p>And it was like, this is really scary.</p>
<p>I personally think AI is amazing and makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I think it will evolve to a place where people have&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to understand,</p>
<p>I work in the world of trust issues, right?</p>
<p>I work in the world of how can technology solve trust</p>
<p>and collaboration issues using encryption,</p>
<p>using cryptographically guaranteed systems,</p>
<p>using decentralized infrastructure, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the world that I&rsquo;ve been inhabiting</p>
<p>for many, many years now,</p>
<p>building smart contracts for seven or eight,</p>
<p>doing stuff before that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m focused on.</p>
<p>So I view AI through that same lens.</p>
<p>And my brain naturally asks,</p>
<p>well, what is the trust issue</p>
<p>that people might have with AI?</p>
<p>And my natural kind of response is,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s say AI continues to be built and improve.</p>
<p>At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen different ideas that were very far from this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen other ideas were very close to this.</p>
<p>At a certain point, we&rsquo;d arrive at a place with AI</p>
<p>where we would be a little bit worried</p>
<p>about just how much it could do, right?</p>
<p>We might be worried that AI could do things</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want it to do,</p>
<p>but we still want to give AI</p>
<p>a level of control over our lives, right?</p>
<p>So in my world, that&rsquo;s a trust issue.</p>
<p>And the way that that trust issue</p>
<p>would be solved with blockchains</p>
<p>is actually very straightforward.</p>
<p>And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful.</p>
<p>You could have an AI that has an ability to do</p>
<p>and control key parts of your and our lives, right?</p>
<p>But then you could limit it with private keys</p>
<p>and blockchains and create certain guardrails</p>
<p>and firm kind of walls and limits</p>
<p>to what the AI could never go past,</p>
<p>assuming that encryption, right?</p>
<p>That encryption continues to work, right?</p>
<p>And assuming that if it&rsquo;s not that AI&rsquo;s specialization</p>
<p>to break encryption, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So if you have an AI that controls</p>
<p>something very important, whatever it is,</p>
<p>shipping or something in defense</p>
<p>or something in the financial system, whatever it is,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re sitting there and you&rsquo;re kind of worried,</p>
<p>hey, this thing is unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming up with things</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of in a hundred years,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s a little too unbelievable.</p>
<p>How do you limit it?</p>
<p>Well, if you bake in private keys</p>
<p>and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations,</p>
<p>you can create the conditions</p>
<p>beyond which an AI could never act.</p>
<p>And those could once again be codified</p>
<p>in the very specific unambiguous terms</p>
<p>in which you described,</p>
<p>which once again, in my trust issue focused world,</p>
<p>would solve the trust issue for users</p>
<p>and make them comfortable with using the AI</p>
<p>or ceding control to the AI,</p>
<p>which I think in more advanced versions of AI</p>
<p>will continue to be a concern, right?</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism</p>
<p>for human supervision of AI systems.</p>
<p>With encryption, very encryption heavy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about like, is it smarter than us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about will the encryption hold up?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s based on the assumption that encryption holds up.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a safe assumption.</p>
<p>We can get into that whole discussion,</p>
<p>but from quantum computing,</p>
<p>but cracking encryption is very difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother discussion.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re safe on the safe ground</p>
<p>for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds.</p>
<p>I, there&rsquo;s a space that is at the cutting edge</p>
<p>of general intelligence research in the AI community,</p>
<p>which is the space of program synthesis</p>
<p>or AI generating programs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s different than what you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is AI being able to generate smart contracts.</p>
<p>And that to me is kind of fascinating</p>
<p>to think of, especially two AI systems</p>
<p>between each other, generating contracts,</p>
<p>sort of almost creating a world</p>
<p>where most of the contracts are between nonhuman beings.</p>
<p>I think an AI system, as I think about it,</p>
<p>and once again, this is not my field.</p>
<p>This is something I might watch a YouTube video on</p>
<p>or just see something interesting about at some point.</p>
<p>I think if I were to just reason through it even now,</p>
<p>I think the highly deterministic</p>
<p>and guaranteed nature of smart contracts</p>
<p>would probably be preferable to an AI</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m guessing an AI would have a lot of problems</p>
<p>with dealing with the human element</p>
<p>of how contracts work today, right?</p>
<p>So an AI, for example, couldn&rsquo;t pick up the phone</p>
<p>and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative</p>
<p>and kind of discuss with Dave and have a call with him</p>
<p>and kind of have a conversation and get him comfortable</p>
<p>and tell him it&rsquo;s gonna be fine</p>
<p>and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues</p>
<p>that have to do with making certain derivatives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that that&rsquo;s a pretty complicated</p>
<p>neural map AI kind of problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if I think about it,</p>
<p>the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts</p>
<p>probably would, and if, assuming they&rsquo;re accessible to AIs,</p>
<p>could actually, interestingly enough, be the format</p>
<p>that they prefer to codify their relationship</p>
<p>with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems,</p>
<p>right, because it is very,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty guaranteed, right?</p>
<p>All the other types of contracts</p>
<p>that an AI could go out there and seek to do</p>
<p>would require some language processing around the law.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know if this is a term,</p>
<p>but probably not a smart AI or a good AI</p>
<p>or whatever the term is for a high quality AI,</p>
<p>would probably realize some of the limitations</p>
<p>and the risks.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity</p>
<p>and would prefer the determinism,</p>
<p>the deterministic nature of smart contracts.</p>
<p>I do wonder about this particular problem</p>
<p>and maybe you could speak to it of how smart contracts</p>
<p>can take over certain industries in a sense</p>
<p>or how certain industries can convert their sets</p>
<p>of agreements into smart contracts,</p>
<p>which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave</p>
<p>from the bank, many of our laws, many of our agreements</p>
<p>are currently through natural language, through words.</p>
<p>And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur</p>
<p>in order to convert the legal agreements,</p>
<p>legal contracts of today to smart contracts</p>
<p>that by the way, AI may be able to help with.</p>
<p>But by way of question, how do you think we convert</p>
<p>the legal contracts on which many industries</p>
<p>currently function today or not even legal contracts,</p>
<p>but ambiguous kind of agreements,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re loose sometimes into more formal</p>
<p>deterministic agreements that are represented</p>
<p>by smart contracts?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s two, maybe two sides to this.</p>
<p>I think the first one is actually not a huge problem</p>
<p>where you have things like the is the master agreement</p>
<p>for derivatives or you have these agreements</p>
<p>that basically already reference a system somewhere,</p>
<p>like for example, many legal agreements</p>
<p>already accept eSignature.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re saying, hey, I&rsquo;m gonna use</p>
<p>this computing system over here around signatures</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna consider, and there&rsquo;s laws around that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s clauses that say eSignature is good enough</p>
<p>for this agreement.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think this is a big problem</p>
<p>for the vast majority of legal agreements</p>
<p>that use systems already.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll swap out one repository</p>
<p>or one set of system of contract settlement.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll just say, hey, this blockchain system over here</p>
<p>is my new system of contract settlement.</p>
<p>Whatever it says is the state of the agreement</p>
<p>instead of the centralized system over there.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s actually a huge amount of agreements</p>
<p>that are already able to do that</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another side to your question,</p>
<p>which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous</p>
<p>that can be turned into smart contracts.</p>
<p>And I think the limitation there is twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, like you said earlier,</p>
<p>the highly reliable smart contract</p>
<p>and the lack of opaqueness and the clarity</p>
<p>of smart contracts is very high and very powerful</p>
<p>and very clear and it&rsquo;s, in my opinion,</p>
<p>gonna be much, much easier to take a smart contract</p>
<p>and turn it into a set of natural language explanations</p>
<p>and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?</p>
<p>So I think that many contracts are,</p>
<p>and even now in decentralized finance and DeFi</p>
<p>and in decentralized insurance,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically being rebuilt in this format</p>
<p>and that rebuilding will make them clearer, like you said,</p>
<p>and then restating those in natural language</p>
<p>and explaining to people, well, you know,</p>
<p>whether it is this, I think it&rsquo;ll actually be a lot simpler</p>
<p>to explain to people what the contract is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Mapping smart contracts into natural language,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s doable</p>
<p>and natural and easy to do.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much clear, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that forced clarity that you talked about.</p>
<p>I think the second aspect of this problem</p>
<p>is the nuance around what contracts can be made unambiguous</p>
<p>and I think that comes down to,</p>
<p>often comes down to proving what happened,</p>
<p>which is where Oracle networks</p>
<p>and decentralized Oracle networks and Chainlink would come in</p>
<p>and our experience there is quite extensive</p>
<p>over the many years that we&rsquo;ve worked on many different</p>
<p>contract types.</p>
<p>I think what it fundamentally comes down to</p>
<p>is whether there is data.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>about whether somebody painted your house</p>
<p>the right color blue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not gonna be doing that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no data feed that tells us</p>
<p>that your house was painted blue</p>
<p>or that it was the right color of blue.</p>
<p>You know, unless somebody sets up a drone</p>
<p>with a color analysis tool and they generate that data.</p>
<p>Which by the way, it could be possible, right?</p>
<p>They could, there could be, if there&rsquo;s enough demand</p>
<p>then the service would be created</p>
<p>that has drones flying around</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s telling you about the colors of, you know,</p>
<p>all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s actual demand that that would be created</p>
<p>and because there&rsquo;ll be value to connect that data feed</p>
<p>to the smart contracts and so on.</p>
<p>I think you have it unbelievably right</p>
<p>because there are already insurance companies</p>
<p>that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead</p>
<p>and see how many people are wearing hard hats.</p>
<p>And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t sufficiently high, then, you know,</p>
<p>the policy is voided.</p>
<p>And so in that case, there is a data source</p>
<p>and that data source can be put</p>
<p>into a hybrid smart contract.</p>
<p>So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is,</p>
<p>is there a data source or a set of data sources</p>
<p>to create definitive truth,</p>
<p>to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity.</p>
<p>And then as you said, I think as people realize</p>
<p>that smart contracts are a format</p>
<p>in which they can form agreement about things</p>
<p>like that insurance product around, you know,</p>
<p>how many people are wearing hard hats.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m the construction site owner, well, you know,</p>
<p>I would really like a guarantee</p>
<p>that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out</p>
<p>if everyone is wearing hard hats.</p>
<p>And in that case, there is demand for the data</p>
<p>and people will generate the data.</p>
<p>And I actually think the insurance industry</p>
<p>is interestingly a precursor of this</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so data driven.</p>
<p>You already see insurance companies paying IoT companies</p>
<p>to put data into their customer&rsquo;s infrastructure</p>
<p>at the cost of the insurance company</p>
<p>to generate the data that the insurance company uses</p>
<p>to make a policy for the customer.</p>
<p>So you basically already have people</p>
<p>who really want to price data into their agreements</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re of sufficiently high value paying</p>
<p>for their own customers to get data sensors</p>
<p>into their infrastructure.</p>
<p>And I think as smart contracts become more</p>
<p>of a requested format or data driven contracts</p>
<p>become more of a format,</p>
<p>there will be a growing demand</p>
<p>about proving what happened through data.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be motivating totally new data feeds being created.</p>
<p>By the way, the insurance industry broadly,</p>
<p>the revolutions there, it would be huge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>semi autonomous and just vehicles in general.</p>
<p>The insurance industry there, by the way,</p>
<p>makes a huge amount of money,</p>
<p>but is using very crappy data feeds,</p>
<p>revolutionizing how like not by crappy,</p>
<p>I mean very crude.</p>
<p>Like literally the insurance is based on things like age,</p>
<p>gender, like basic demographic information</p>
<p>as opposed to really high resolution information</p>
<p>about you as an individual,</p>
<p>which you may or may not want to provide.</p>
<p>So you can choose from an individual perspective</p>
<p>to provide a data feed.</p>
<p>And there like the power of insurance</p>
<p>to enable the individual,</p>
<p>to empower the individual could be huge</p>
<p>because ultimately smart contracts motivate the use of data,</p>
<p>the creation of new data feeds,</p>
<p>but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth,</p>
<p>as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are.</p>
<p>So that I&rsquo;m not, again,</p>
<p>not sure how that would change things,</p>
<p>but in terms of the fundamental experience of life,</p>
<p>because I think we all rely on insurance,</p>
<p>not just in business, but in life</p>
<p>and grounding that insurance</p>
<p>in more and more accurate representation of reality</p>
<p>might just have transformative effects on society.</p>
<p>Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said,</p>
<p>where I noticed another trust issue,</p>
<p>you said the user might not want to share their data.</p>
<p>So what you could actually do,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ve already worked on is,</p>
<p>you can have a smart contract that holds the data</p>
<p>and evaluates the data of the user</p>
<p>without sharing it with the insurance companies.</p>
<p>And the insurance company knows that the smart contract</p>
<p>will evaluate it according to the policy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need the data.</p>
<p>And the user can provide the data</p>
<p>knowing it&rsquo;ll never touch the insurance company</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only provided to the smart contract.</p>
<p>And suddenly you&rsquo;ve solved another trust issue</p>
<p>because the autonomous piece of code</p>
<p>can evaluate information separately from the interests</p>
<p>of both of the counterparties.</p>
<p>And so this is the recurring theme.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re seeing this recurring theme</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a trust issue,</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t use the system, they can&rsquo;t collaborate,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t share information</p>
<p>that would make a better agreement for both of them,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t solve a risk in their daily life,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t participate in a market,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t have a bank account</p>
<p>because nobody will give it to them</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t give it to them in that legal system.</p>
<p>And once you have an autonomous piece of code</p>
<p>that can also know what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>thanks to Oracle networks and that combination of the code</p>
<p>and the Oracle network for the hybrid smart contract,</p>
<p>the same pattern just recurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the same pattern.</p>
<p>And this is why I keep saying trust issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I basically,</p>
<p>almost every contractual trust issue that I see</p>
<p>where there is a piece of data to prove</p>
<p>and settle the trust issue</p>
<p>in a way that works for both parties,</p>
<p>there is no reason not to use an autonomous,</p>
<p>highly reliable contract and piece of code.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this in a lot of different industries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it insurance, ad networks,</p>
<p>global finance, global trade,</p>
<p>those are all multi trillion dollar industries.</p>
<p>And then there are other smaller industries.</p>
<p>Like even one of the first smart contracts</p>
<p>we worked on many years ago</p>
<p>was for search engine optimization firms</p>
<p>where they would tell you,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m gonna raise your search engine ranking,</p>
<p>give me the money.</p>
<p>And people wouldn&rsquo;t wanna give them the money</p>
<p>because they never knew if they were gonna do it.</p>
<p>And then the search engine firm</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t wanna do any work</p>
<p>thinking they&rsquo;ll never get any money.</p>
<p>So we just initially even came up with a system</p>
<p>where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract</p>
<p>and it would be released based on whether the search rank</p>
<p>of a website got to a certain level on Google</p>
<p>for a certain keyword, right?</p>
<p>And so the trust problem was solved.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just the same story, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like trust issues around AI,</p>
<p>trust issues around financial products,</p>
<p>trust issues around insurance,</p>
<p>trust issues around social media, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what people looking at this industry</p>
<p>really need to understand.</p>
<p>And once they do understand,</p>
<p>they realize what this is all about.</p>
<p>This is about redefining how everyone collaborates</p>
<p>with everyone about everything</p>
<p>where we can prove something through data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned confidentiality and privacy</p>
<p>that the parties don&rsquo;t need to necessarily know private data</p>
<p>in this interaction.</p>
<p>You talk about confidentiality in the white paper</p>
<p>for Chainlink 2.0.</p>
<p>Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality</p>
<p>in this process?</p>
<p>Sure, sure, absolutely.</p>
<p>So I think you once again need to think of the contract</p>
<p>as existing in two parts, right?</p>
<p>You have the on chain code</p>
<p>and then you have this off chain system</p>
<p>called the centralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>So the question is really what portion of the contract</p>
<p>should live in what part of these two systems, right?</p>
<p>So if you wanna create transparency,</p>
<p>you should put more information on chain</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what blockchains are very good at.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re public, transparent,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t necessarily have privacy.</p>
<p>Well, you can see how those two things</p>
<p>are a little bit kind of completely diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>So I do think and I do see blockchains working</p>
<p>on on chain encrypted smart contracts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very inefficient.</p>
<p>It has a lot of nuances around it.</p>
<p>That I think will appear at some point.</p>
<p>I think until it appears,</p>
<p>you have an option of taking a part of the computation</p>
<p>and putting it into the centralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>We actually did an entire paper about this</p>
<p>that we presented at Stanford in February of last year,</p>
<p>something called Mixicles,</p>
<p>which basically talks about how you can take</p>
<p>an Oracle network and you can put a portion</p>
<p>of the computation into the Oracle network,</p>
<p>assuming that you&rsquo;re comfortable with that limited set</p>
<p>of nodes knowing what the computation is.</p>
<p>And you could actually provide additional confidentiality</p>
<p>through special hardware</p>
<p>called trusted execution environments</p>
<p>that all those nodes are forced to run.</p>
<p>So they won&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re operating.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if you look at a hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>as gaining functionality from its on chain code</p>
<p>and gaining other functionality</p>
<p>from its off chain decentralized Oracle network component,</p>
<p>you can place the part of the computation</p>
<p>that you would like to be private</p>
<p>in the decentralized Oracle network,</p>
<p>because you can control the set of nodes.</p>
<p>You can control the committee of nodes</p>
<p>and you can require that they run certain hardware</p>
<p>to keep the information private, right?</p>
<p>So you could basically make a derivative that,</p>
<p>or a binary option is the example used</p>
<p>in the Mixicles paper where the payout happened on chain,</p>
<p>but it was actually impossible to tell</p>
<p>what the outcome of the contract was.</p>
<p>So the outcome of the contract was computed</p>
<p>in the centralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>And then there was a switch that triggered</p>
<p>who received the payment,</p>
<p>but from the point of view of analyzing</p>
<p>the on chain transactions and seeing who received</p>
<p>the payment or what the outcome of the contract was,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t derive that,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t backward engineer what that was,</p>
<p>but the users of that hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>still had on chain code that guaranteed them</p>
<p>that as long as the decentralized Oracle network</p>
<p>found a certain outcome, right?</p>
<p>Determined a certain outcome</p>
<p>that the relevant user would get paid</p>
<p>and there was still a place to put value, right?</p>
<p>So there is this kind of fundamental tension</p>
<p>between confidentiality, privacy,</p>
<p>which is very important for many contracts,</p>
<p>which is critical to many contracts</p>
<p>and the public and transparent nature of blockchains,</p>
<p>which I think eventually will be solved</p>
<p>through encrypted on chain smart contracts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll take some time,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll take years in my opinion.</p>
<p>And before we arrive there,</p>
<p>I think people will put the private portion</p>
<p>into the centralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>Once again, going back to what</p>
<p>the decentralized Oracle networks do,</p>
<p>they seek to provide these services, right?</p>
<p>So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation</p>
<p>is perhaps a service without which</p>
<p>a certain type of contract might never come into existence</p>
<p>in the form of an on chain hybrid smart contract.</p>
<p>And so this is once again,</p>
<p>what we see the centralized Oracle networks</p>
<p>and decentralized services doing</p>
<p>is providing people these tools and building blocks</p>
<p>to compose, like I&rsquo;m great at making</p>
<p>these derivatives contracts,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t make them unless I can retain</p>
<p>the privacy of them.</p>
<p>And our goal is to provide the infrastructure</p>
<p>that gives you as a developer</p>
<p>and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve seen is that as we provide that capability,</p>
<p>people create more,</p>
<p>which is also really the story of the internet, right?</p>
<p>The story of the internet is it was really tough</p>
<p>to do eCommerce while everything was an HTTP</p>
<p>and credit cards were transmitted publicly.</p>
<p>And so eCommerce was kind of tough</p>
<p>because how am I gonna send my credit card</p>
<p>over public on encrypted channels, right?</p>
<p>But the second HTTPS appears,</p>
<p>eCommerce becomes a lot easier</p>
<p>because I can put in my credit card number</p>
<p>and it can be sent over an encrypted channel</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not at risk.</p>
<p>And so I can participate in eCommerce</p>
<p>as long as I have a credit card.</p>
<p>I think those types, and I&rsquo;m sure that was unexpected,</p>
<p>right, I&rsquo;m sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome</p>
<p>from that technology.</p>
<p>And so I think this is why we sometimes have this focus</p>
<p>on privacy because in our work with contracts</p>
<p>and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form,</p>
<p>we see a substantial amount of need for privacy</p>
<p>as an inherent property of these contracts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll take a while before that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to create the kind of technology innovation required</p>
<p>to do that on chain.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a few ideas that are being floating about,</p>
<p>but so the currently distributed Oracle networks</p>
<p>provide that feature, which is essential to many contracts.</p>
<p>What brings to mind in this whole space,</p>
<p>again, it might be outside of your expertise,</p>
<p>but within the world which I&rsquo;m passionate about,</p>
<p>which is machine learning,</p>
<p>and it seems like very naturally</p>
<p>because current machine learning systems</p>
<p>are very data hungry</p>
<p>and much of the value mined by companies</p>
<p>in the digital space are from data.</p>
<p>They often want their data to maintain privacy.</p>
<p>So you think about an autonomous vehicle space,</p>
<p>Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data,</p>
<p>Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data.</p>
<p>It seems like it would be very beneficial</p>
<p>to form contracts where one could use the data</p>
<p>from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way,</p>
<p>but also where all the uses of data are codified</p>
<p>and you can exchange value cleanly,</p>
<p>basically contracts over data,</p>
<p>over machine learning systems use of different data.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, do you talk to machine learning folks</p>
<p>that use ideas of smart contracts</p>
<p>or is that for outside of your interest?</p>
<p>Because it seems like exceptionally applicable set of,</p>
<p>when we talk about different services</p>
<p>that might be created and revolutionized by smart,</p>
<p>especially hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me</p>
<p>in all industries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to interact with those folks, with those services.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re talking about is more data marketplaces</p>
<p>in the data marketplace side of things.</p>
<p>Well, this is actually once again, very applicable</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a trust issue.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m trying to sell you some data.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the quality of the data.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know what you wanna pay for it.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t give you the data for you</p>
<p>to determine the quality</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve given you the data, right?</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>We need an autonomous impartial agent.</p>
<p>We need an impartial computational kind of agent</p>
<p>and on chain smart contract with an Oracle network</p>
<p>to assess my data to write,</p>
<p>to basically take random cross section samples of the data,</p>
<p>assess it for quality, assess it for signal</p>
<p>from the algorithm you have,</p>
<p>which you don&rsquo;t wanna share with me</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna know the algorithm</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working on, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want me to know what you want the data for.</p>
<p>So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm,</p>
<p>keeping it private from me and takes my data,</p>
<p>keeping it private from you,</p>
<p>assesses it on a random cross section sampling</p>
<p>for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you,</p>
<p>allows you to determine a price.</p>
<p>And now both you and me know that we&rsquo;ve arrived</p>
<p>at a fair price for the quality of my data</p>
<p>for what you wanna do with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s once again,</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve seen in the data marketplaces,</p>
<p>which are full of people who want that data</p>
<p>for these learning models, often for financial markets,</p>
<p>often for other reasons,</p>
<p>this is their fundamental problem,</p>
<p>which amazingly enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trust issue that is getting solved.</p>
<p>And I think you can see even on the face of it,</p>
<p>once that trust issue is solved,</p>
<p>those markets can work a lot better, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to know your algorithm.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know my data.</p>
<p>We both know that the autonomous agent</p>
<p>is not under either of our control</p>
<p>and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all very comfortable with that.</p>
<p>I could even make conditions</p>
<p>that your algorithm isn&rsquo;t analyzing the data</p>
<p>for something I don&rsquo;t want you to analyze it for,</p>
<p>or you could make conditions</p>
<p>that the data has to have any number of properties.</p>
<p>And once again, you haven&rsquo;t leaked any signal to me</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t leaked any data to you,</p>
<p>which is once again,</p>
<p>just another type of trust issue that all of this solve.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same pattern.</p>
<p>If you work in this industry long enough,</p>
<p>or if you really look at these use cases long enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll simply come to the question,</p>
<p>and this is the useful question,</p>
<p>what is the trust issue this is solving?</p>
<p>And then if you can get an answer to that question</p>
<p>on a case by case basis,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll understand why blockchains are relevant.</p>
<p>And then once you do that with enough use cases,</p>
<p>it becomes a little bit mind blank.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned trust quite a bit.</p>
<p>You also mentioned trust minimization</p>
<p>in the Chainlink White Paper.</p>
<p>Can we dig into trust a little bit more?</p>
<p>What is the nature of trust</p>
<p>that you think about in these smart contracts?</p>
<p>What is trust minimization?</p>
<p>How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important maybe to have a conception</p>
<p>of what the alternative is, right?</p>
<p>What is highly reliable trust minimized off chain</p>
<p>and on chain computation and alternative to?</p>
<p>So this is just kind of how I see the world</p>
<p>in these two camps.</p>
<p>One camp is the traditional,</p>
<p>what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp.</p>
<p>And this is the world as pretty much most</p>
<p>or all people know today.</p>
<p>This is the world where there&rsquo;s a bank logo</p>
<p>or an insurance company logo, or some kind of logo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very big building with marble arches</p>
<p>and columns, it&rsquo;s the biggest building in the town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bigger than the church.</p>
<p>And everybody feels very good.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got such a nice logo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a big building.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I give them my money?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I interact with them on the basis</p>
<p>of any kind of agreement?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And that is definitely better than that not being there.</p>
<p>And that is definitely a huge improvement</p>
<p>for how people conduct commerce.</p>
<p>Letters of credit from branded entities</p>
<p>are very important for global trade to take place</p>
<p>in the early stages of global trade.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good, but it is fundamentally</p>
<p>just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it.</p>
<p>And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood</p>
<p>or somebody else suddenly has to change,</p>
<p>well, it changes and you can&rsquo;t really do anything about it.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to change anything</p>
<p>about what happened there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some long terms of service.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other agreements around all this stuff.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the brand based and paper guarantee world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all very vague and opaque</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of hoping for the best</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a nice logo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around a hundred years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of marble.</p>
<p>Put a lot of marble.</p>
<p>Big building, lots of marbles.</p>
<p>This is why banks have such nice buildings, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they want to spend money on buildings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to create confidence in them as an entity</p>
<p>in order for people to transact through them, right?</p>
<p>This is why all these kind of go to cities</p>
<p>that had gold rushes, go to cities</p>
<p>that needed banking as a service in certain time periods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the most beautiful buildings</p>
<p>at least in the United States.</p>
<p>So this is the brand based paper guarantee model</p>
<p>for which up until now,</p>
<p>there has never been an alternative, right?</p>
<p>So up until now, if you had a bad experience with a bank</p>
<p>or insurance company or some logo somewhere,</p>
<p>you would only have one option.</p>
<p>Your option would be to go across the road</p>
<p>and down the block to another building</p>
<p>with another color of marble</p>
<p>and another set of agreements</p>
<p>that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements, right?</p>
<p>Now for the first time, you have mathematical agreements.</p>
<p>You have mathematically guaranteed encryption secured,</p>
<p>decentralized infrastructure powered agreements, right?</p>
<p>This is really the shift.</p>
<p>This is really the comparison and the alternative</p>
<p>through which people should view all of this in my opinion,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s once again, this conception</p>
<p>that everything is fine, everything works very well.</p>
<p>Well, it does, it works fine and very well</p>
<p>as long as nothing goes wrong.</p>
<p>And then in the cases when things go wrong,</p>
<p>which they pretty much invariably at some point do,</p>
<p>then you find out that, well, you know,</p>
<p>turns out they don&rsquo;t have to pay me</p>
<p>or turns out I can&rsquo;t trade</p>
<p>or turns out the ATMs can be locked up</p>
<p>and only give me 66 euros per day,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m a business or an individual,</p>
<p>like what happened in Greece a few years ago, right?</p>
<p>And the reality is that once that becomes a strong enough</p>
<p>kind of realization for people,</p>
<p>I think they will all just migrate</p>
<p>to mathematically guaranteed contracts</p>
<p>because why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts,</p>
<p>kind of how do we, and cryptographically secured</p>
<p>and decentralized infrastructure powered,</p>
<p>how do we evolve into that world?</p>
<p>Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus,</p>
<p>right, it comes down to a collection of independent nodes,</p>
<p>a collection of provably independent computing systems</p>
<p>arriving at the same conclusion impartially.</p>
<p>That conclusion might be the transaction</p>
<p>is valid between address A and address B,</p>
<p>address A has one Bitcoin,</p>
<p>wants to send it to address B,</p>
<p>now address B has one Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one degree of validation.</p>
<p>It has certain cryptographic primitives</p>
<p>that are used, certain levels of cryptography,</p>
<p>encryption, and other methods</p>
<p>that basically provide clarity and those guarantees.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, it&rsquo;s this level of consensus</p>
<p>that multiple independent computing systems</p>
<p>came to the same conclusion, verified that conclusion</p>
<p>and created a sense of finality,</p>
<p>created a final state that is globally considered</p>
<p>to be the state of a transaction.</p>
<p>And that is how it&rsquo;s achieved, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s achieved by users looking</p>
<p>at these mathematical contract systems and saying,</p>
<p>you know, if I have money in a bank,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one single person who controls that money,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the bank,</p>
<p>they could choose to give me my money</p>
<p>or choose not to give me my money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s a percentage of what I own</p>
<p>that I wanna put into another system</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s thousands of independent computing systems</p>
<p>that are promising me, you know,</p>
<p>with the help of cryptographic primitives,</p>
<p>that I will be able to always have access to this,</p>
<p>whatever this is, whatever this token is,</p>
<p>I will at least, or at the very least,</p>
<p>I will always have unfettered,</p>
<p>complete control and access to it.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>Another example is, hey,</p>
<p>we have a hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>for something like crop insurance.</p>
<p>I, as the user, evaluate where this smart contract runs.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, the smart contract runs on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Great, thousands of nodes,</p>
<p>lots of computational security,</p>
<p>hash power, so on and so on.</p>
<p>Then I look at, oh, well, what triggers the contract?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s this Oracle network.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes,</p>
<p>gets data from five different weather stations.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m comfortable with that.</p>
<p>I have a certain level of comfort</p>
<p>with that hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>and its ability to provide me consensus</p>
<p>about the transaction</p>
<p>once the contract knows what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m comfortable with the consensus around the event</p>
<p>that controls the contract, right?</p>
<p>Because once again,</p>
<p>that event is what determines</p>
<p>what happens with the contract.</p>
<p>And if the contract is super well written,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the event isn&rsquo;t reliable, right?</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve made this determination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten all this clear, transparent information</p>
<p>about this system that combines the contract code</p>
<p>with a decentralized Oracle network.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve made my decision to participate</p>
<p>in this decentralized insurance,</p>
<p>kind of crop insurance policy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sent the Bitcoin or the stable coin</p>
<p>or whatever I have on my Android phone.</p>
<p>And then time goes by and let&rsquo;s say it doesn&rsquo;t rain,</p>
<p>lo and behold, the smart contract returns</p>
<p>the relevant amount from the policy back to me.</p>
<p>I continue my life as a farmer.</p>
<p>And by the way, the fact that that happened</p>
<p>contributes reputation and contributes proof</p>
<p>back to both the contract</p>
<p>as something that can prove to other people</p>
<p>that it has settled and the Oracle network</p>
<p>as something that can prove</p>
<p>that it has properly assessed reality</p>
<p>or properly triggered a contract.</p>
<p>And this is where there&rsquo;s one of many network effects</p>
<p>where the more that smart contracts</p>
<p>and Oracle networks are used,</p>
<p>they themselves generate this immutable on chain data</p>
<p>that proves their value and reliability.</p>
<p>And improving more and more of that</p>
<p>in more and more kind of use cases</p>
<p>and more and more variants of the same contract,</p>
<p>they arrive at a greater body of proof</p>
<p>that they like, I am the decentralized crop,</p>
<p>the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance</p>
<p>used by a million users.</p>
<p>And my failure rate is non existent or really low.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my Oracle network.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s also settled a million of these.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the logo, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, hey, what a nice logo you have</p>
<p>on top of a building above a train terminal or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more, hey, there&rsquo;s a million people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a million separate contracts</p>
<p>that got settled correctly.</p>
<p>I have all the proof that I could ever need about that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s very easy to gain, right?</p>
<p>Because real value was at stake, real value was moved around.</p>
<p>And so I think once again,</p>
<p>the transparency aspect comes in where you&rsquo;re able to prove</p>
<p>that the cryptographically enforced contracts are better.</p>
<p>That said, you can still integrate the traditional banks</p>
<p>as long as you create a data feed</p>
<p>on the amount of marble that&rsquo;s included.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s valuable to you in terms of reputation,</p>
<p>you could still integrate the marble, the amount of marble</p>
<p>that and the size of the logo.</p>
<p>We could still keep the banks around.</p>
<p>I think we will.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;ll happen with the banks</p>
<p>and all the insurance companies, by the way,</p>
<p>is not that they&rsquo;ll all just die or something.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be just like the internet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some of them that adopt this</p>
<p>and some of them that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and some of them that do it faster,</p>
<p>some of them that do it slower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an economic decision that they&rsquo;ll make.</p>
<p>I think their whole question is,</p>
<p>is this a foregone conclusion?</p>
<p>I mean, I think my answer is yes,</p>
<p>this is definitely gonna be happening.</p>
<p>I think they still have a question of,</p>
<p>is this gonna change my industry?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m seeing a definite shift in people&rsquo;s understanding.</p>
<p>And I think that shift is gonna accelerate rapidly</p>
<p>as one or two of them of their competitors</p>
<p>throw their hat in the smart contract ring</p>
<p>and say, well, I have smart contracts.</p>
<p>I guarantee my outcomes to you.</p>
<p>What do they do for you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s risky, just use mine.</p>
<p>And the second some of them start losing business</p>
<p>because of that, they&rsquo;re gonna move very quickly</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what all of their compensation structures</p>
<p>and all their goal planning structures are based around.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re based around what is losing us business</p>
<p>or getting us business.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating organizationally though,</p>
<p>to think about banks, they&rsquo;re very old school</p>
<p>and their ability to move quickly is questionable to me.</p>
<p>I just look at basic online banking,</p>
<p>like how good banks are creating</p>
<p>a frictionless online experience.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re not very good.</p>
<p>And so that speaks to the kind of people</p>
<p>who are in leadership positions at banks,</p>
<p>the kind of people they hire,</p>
<p>the kind of culture there is.</p>
<p>So I do wonder if banks will from inside</p>
<p>revolutionize themselves to include smart contracts</p>
<p>or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge</p>
<p>that basically create new kinds of banks.</p>
<p>Whether, what is the company square?</p>
<p>I think it comes up out of nowhere really with Cash App</p>
<p>and they have Bitcoin on Cash App,</p>
<p>whether they will start incorporating smart contracts</p>
<p>and they will revolutionize the whole banking industry</p>
<p>or whether Bank of America will revolutionize themselves</p>
<p>from within.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical on Bank of America, but you never know.</p>
<p>In general, I&rsquo;m fascinated by how big organizations,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Google or Microsoft or Bank of America,</p>
<p>pivot hard in a world that&rsquo;s quickly changing.</p>
<p>I think that takes bold leadership and a lot of firing</p>
<p>and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings</p>
<p>where the one asshole brings up the</p>
<p>from first principles idea that, you know what,</p>
<p>the ways we&rsquo;ve been doing stuff in the past require,</p>
<p>we need to throw that out and do stuff totally differently.</p>
<p>I know a lot of those assholes</p>
<p>in a lot of these different industries.</p>
<p>First of all, I think they&rsquo;re getting listened to more</p>
<p>and second of all, I think all of these places,</p>
<p>as I look at it more and more,</p>
<p>I think they have a fundamental line of business</p>
<p>that they try to protect</p>
<p>and then everybody&rsquo;s compensation</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s metrics and goals</p>
<p>is focused around that line of business.</p>
<p>So the second that things begin to impact that,</p>
<p>then everybody will be in a senior meeting</p>
<p>and that asshole will be quite listened to</p>
<p>because he will have the only thoughtful explanation</p>
<p>as to why this is happening.</p>
<p>How things will evolve from there, I actually don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because that hasn&rsquo;t been the case yet.</p>
<p>But my thinking is that there will be people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t wanna cannibalize certain parts of their business</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t wanna change certain parts of their business</p>
<p>and then there will be people who say,</p>
<p>look, I think this is how the world&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make a very, very heavy</p>
<p>kind of set of commitments to put resources towards this.</p>
<p>I already see that with a few banks</p>
<p>working on various blockchain based systems,</p>
<p>but granted, they&rsquo;ve been working on those for years.</p>
<p>So I think all of this comes down</p>
<p>to these kind of quarterly earnings calls</p>
<p>where somebody asks them, hey, I saw that bank over there</p>
<p>once the blockchain bond</p>
<p>or a smart contract derivative platform.</p>
<p>And I also saw that they made $10 billion in revenues</p>
<p>or $10 billion in volume or whatever it is from that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your plan on the earnings call?</p>
<p>And I promise you by the next earnings call,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a plan.</p>
<p>And then the question on the next one is,</p>
<p>well, when&rsquo;s the plan gonna happen?</p>
<p>And then by the next earnings call,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a plan is happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what these people are sensitive to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what these organizations are structured around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely economically like disconnected, right?</p>
<p>They have this core business, they wanna protect it.</p>
<p>I understand that idea,</p>
<p>but I think that the problem with that</p>
<p>is sometimes it requires this myopic focus, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what all the innovation stuff is about.</p>
<p>Every time somebody at a corporate entity</p>
<p>is about innovation, they&rsquo;re trying to sidestep this.</p>
<p>But once again, the incentives to maintain</p>
<p>whatever the core businesses is so strong</p>
<p>that the innovation people, even though they are there,</p>
<p>I think they get a phone call and go like,</p>
<p>what are we doing for this?</p>
<p>And the ones that actually did good work</p>
<p>and got ready to do something for this</p>
<p>have done their employer and their organization</p>
<p>a very positive service.</p>
<p>Whereas the ones that aren&rsquo;t ready,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ll make up something</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re really smart and they&rsquo;ll get it together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Can we talk about tokens a little bit?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there&rsquo;s been a meteoric rise</p>
<p>of a bunch of different tokens.</p>
<p>We could just talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples.</p>
<p>Bitcoin I think crossed $60,000 in value.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts in general on this rise?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the future of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the future of Ethereum?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the total value locked metric</p>
<p>that I think generalizes the different kind of value</p>
<p>of these tokens.</p>
<p>What does the future value and impact</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency look like</p>
<p>if we look through the lens of these tokens?</p>
<p>I think valuing all these tokens</p>
<p>and determining that isn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly great at.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the vast majority of my time</p>
<p>on building these systems and architecting them</p>
<p>and getting them to fruition and getting them to a place</p>
<p>where they operate properly on both the technical</p>
<p>and the crypto economic and in every other sense.</p>
<p>I think with Bitcoin,</p>
<p>there is a certain conception</p>
<p>of non governmental fiat money</p>
<p>that Bitcoin is really the first creator of, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this very powerful idea called fiat money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically more or less a kind of 40 year experiment.</p>
<p>I think on August 15th of this year</p>
<p>is maybe I think given the 40th anniversary,</p>
<p>government can say, hey, I have a currency</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s worth something and here it is.</p>
<p>In terms of the way that governments have stopped that</p>
<p>in the past is if anyone tries to make</p>
<p>another fiat currency in their country,</p>
<p>they immediately shut it down, right?</p>
<p>They immediately say, hey, this is really bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done something really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for you to stop.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>And it stops, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the history of non governmental fiat currency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is really due to its decentralized nature,</p>
<p>the first and possibly in some cases,</p>
<p>in many people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the only true non governmental fiat currency.</p>
<p>Now, how powerful is non governmental fiat currency?</p>
<p>I have no idea, right?</p>
<p>This is why so it&rsquo;s really as powerful as the ideas</p>
<p>that people ascribe to it are, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say people start saying,</p>
<p>like right now people are saying,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s internet money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the money of the internet.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that worth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably worth a lot.</p>
<p>I have no idea what it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>but as an idea, as a concept to underpin the fiat money,</p>
<p>the let there be aspect of fiat and of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you basically look at it and you say,</p>
<p>yeah, internet money.</p>
<p>Okay, that could be worth whatever,</p>
<p>60,000, 600,000, great question, right?</p>
<p>There are other versions of the world, right?</p>
<p>Where people say,</p>
<p>there are countries that don&rsquo;t have a good fiat currency</p>
<p>and I see a lot of people using Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t internet money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s countries without a good currency money.</p>
<p>So all the countries without a good currency</p>
<p>now use Bitcoin and let there be,</p>
<p>Bitcoin as this, right?</p>
<p>As this conception of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Probably huge amount of value.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a further conception of Bitcoin</p>
<p>as some digital gold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scarcity dynamic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these other kinds of dynamics.</p>
<p>What is a portable version of digital gold</p>
<p>with some kind of built in scarcity worth?</p>
<p>You know, kind of artificially created scarcity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that worth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the analysis on that is the point,</p>
<p>might be worth a lot.</p>
<p>What is it all worth if all three of these things,</p>
<p>you know, flow into the same fiat,</p>
<p>kind of let there be Bitcoin</p>
<p>as these three things conception of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>but could be worth a huge amount.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s super important</p>
<p>what I think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>or what many other people think it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really that important.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s probably important</p>
<p>is understanding what the societal conception of Bitcoin is</p>
<p>and how does that societal conception evolve over time.</p>
<p>And that interestingly enough,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just depend on, you know,</p>
<p>you or me or the people who made Bitcoin or anything else.</p>
<p>It actually depends on current events.</p>
<p>So for example, if people suddenly say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more and more worried about fiat currency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more and more worried that governmental fiat,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s the most reliable version of that</p>
<p>is not as good as I thought it was.</p>
<p>Maybe I should go on the PayPal app</p>
<p>and maybe I should get some Bitcoin just in case.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the world where Bitcoin is a certain percentage</p>
<p>of everyone&rsquo;s ownership as a hedge</p>
<p>against governmental fiat money not being so good?</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t done the analysis, but another example, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this conception, that&rsquo;s the conception.</p>
<p>So when I look at Bitcoin,</p>
<p>what I see is a lot of these fascinating conceptions</p>
<p>of what the fiat, let there be value of Bitcoin is.</p>
<p>By the way, all of them could be true.</p>
<p>Maybe some of them are true.</p>
<p>Maybe some of them aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>And the fascinating thing is that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this conception change, right?</p>
<p>So when I started in the Bitcoin space,</p>
<p>the conception was micropayments.</p>
<p>The cost of Bitcoin is low, we&rsquo;ll have micropayments.</p>
<p>Micropayments are wonderful for machine to machine</p>
<p>transactions, micropayments are wonderful.</p>
<p>The emerging market, and that&rsquo;s fine, right?</p>
<p>And that was one conception of Bitcoin</p>
<p>as let there be Bitcoin as micropayments platform, right?</p>
<p>But then the value rose and things changed.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t enough expansion in certain ways.</p>
<p>And now the conception has evolved</p>
<p>into this other conception.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think governments have a very clear set of steps</p>
<p>for directing the public&rsquo;s conception of their fiat, right?</p>
<p>They say our fiat is worth this for these reasons.</p>
<p>Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have an official Bitcoin spokesperson</p>
<p>that goes out and says,</p>
<p>the non governmental money called Bitcoin,</p>
<p>the non governmental fiat money called Bitcoin</p>
<p>has value on the basis of this, this, this and this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our fiscal budget, here&rsquo;s our future plans.</p>
<p>Our money will continue to be safe and secure and reliable.</p>
<p>And so what that hole creates</p>
<p>is a hole that we all fill, right?</p>
<p>We all basically come to some vague kind of</p>
<p>group understanding that Bitcoin is worth this</p>
<p>because it is tied to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say all non governmental fiat money comes</p>
<p>into question, everybody doubts it,</p>
<p>possibly due to inflation.</p>
<p>And everybody says, you know, this is nice,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to keep 10, 20% of my wealth</p>
<p>in non governmental fiat, just in case,</p>
<p>you know, what are those numbers?</p>
<p>I mean, if that happens, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you can add a few zeros.</p>
<p>I like how you say I haven&rsquo;t done the analysis</p>
<p>as if I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people have done</p>
<p>quote unquote analysis, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still speculation.</p>
<p>Nobody can predict the future,</p>
<p>especially when so much of it has to do</p>
<p>with a large number of people holding an idea</p>
<p>in their mind as to the importance</p>
<p>of a particular technology like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement by its possibilities,</p>
<p>but the number of zeros you add is an open question</p>
<p>and nobody can do a perfect analysis</p>
<p>except whoever created this simulation.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few people who suggest that person is you.</p>
<p>So is it you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who do you think it could be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is.</p>
<p>I think if I had to guess, it&rsquo;s probably a group of people,</p>
<p>some of which might not even be around anymore.</p>
<p>You know, obviously I&rsquo;m very grateful to,</p>
<p>if this is a singular or a group of people</p>
<p>for kicking off this entire industry</p>
<p>and making this amazing change in the world</p>
<p>that I have the privilege and luxury</p>
<p>of being part of in some small way in the work that I do.</p>
<p>I think also this kind of focus on who is Satoshi</p>
<p>or who isn&rsquo;t Satoshi,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t in my opinion matter so much</p>
<p>because regardless of who it is,</p>
<p>that in my opinion should have no substantial</p>
<p>significant effect or bearing on the functioning</p>
<p>or the value or the use</p>
<p>or the security of the Bitcoin system, right?</p>
<p>So I think whoever it is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably better off not making that public.</p>
<p>And I think beyond that,</p>
<p>whoever it turned out to be shouldn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because it has nothing to do</p>
<p>with how the system is made useful</p>
<p>or secure or anything else.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the point of view that I have.</p>
<p>Now, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto, would you tell me?</p>
<p>Because you said they shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>whoever Satoshi is, you should keep that private.</p>
<p>So would you tell it to me or no?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in some kind of weird like thought experiment here.</p>
<p>If I was this guy, let me think about this,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not, by the way, I am not this person.</p>
<p>But if you were, would you say it?</p>
<p>I think probably not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the,</p>
<p>I think that they would cause a lot of distraction</p>
<p>and a lot of weird stuff.</p>
<p>And so realistically, I don&rsquo;t think it would help anybody</p>
<p>or even the person who discloses it,</p>
<p>but just to be clear, I am not.</p>
<p>And whoever it is, I think they haven&rsquo;t said anything</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want the attention</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want the distraction</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want all the problems from this.</p>
<p>And that makes sense to me, conceptually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think if they&rsquo;re still out there</p>
<p>and part of the Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency community,</p>
<p>and it is inspiring to think that if they&rsquo;re out there,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not revealing their identity</p>
<p>because it would be a distraction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of inspiring that people are like that.</p>
<p>Just like George Washington,</p>
<p>a relinquishing power is inspiring</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s ultimately about the progress of the community</p>
<p>and not some kind of ego driven attention scheme.</p>
<p>Again, very inspiring.</p>
<p>The humans at their best are inspiring.</p>
<p>What do you think about the certainty</p>
<p>that people in the Bitcoin Maximus community</p>
<p>have about this particular piece of technology, Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting that you think</p>
<p>that you might wanna say about this community</p>
<p>or is it just is what it is?</p>
<p>I think at the end of the day,</p>
<p>results speak for themselves</p>
<p>and Bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry</p>
<p>and has had an amazing impact on the world.</p>
<p>And I think the result is still</p>
<p>that Bitcoin is very widely adopted</p>
<p>and driving the adoption of our industry in many ways.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very difficult for people to say</p>
<p>that Bitcoin maximalists don&rsquo;t have something</p>
<p>that they can latch onto and say,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s something very real here.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been decisions made</p>
<p>by the Bitcoin community</p>
<p>and the people who made the Bitcoin protocol</p>
<p>to focus it on Bitcoin</p>
<p>and to focus it on the kind of storing</p>
<p>of the ledger of Bitcoin</p>
<p>and the information about Bitcoin</p>
<p>and the transaction of Bitcoin</p>
<p>and to focus on securing that.</p>
<p>And I understand why that decision was made</p>
<p>to a certain degree, right?</p>
<p>It was about focus.</p>
<p>It was about getting something worthwhile right</p>
<p>without adding additional features and additional risk.</p>
<p>And that decision is a decision that was made</p>
<p>and has kind of the benefits of focus</p>
<p>and the benefits of a certain amount of security</p>
<p>and a certain amount of guarantees around Bitcoin</p>
<p>and what that is and the value of that.</p>
<p>And then it has certain limitations</p>
<p>as a consequence of doing less</p>
<p>or having the system hold data</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t related to Bitcoin</p>
<p>or not having the system hold contractual outcomes</p>
<p>or smart contract code.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just kind of a decision, right?</p>
<p>And I understand why they&rsquo;re excited</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very excited.</p>
<p>I started in this industry going to Bitcoin meetups</p>
<p>and I met a lot of fantastic people,</p>
<p>libertarian people that wanted</p>
<p>to see the world work differently</p>
<p>and shared a lot of my beliefs</p>
<p>and a lot of my points of view.</p>
<p>And so anyone who&rsquo;s been in the industry</p>
<p>as long as I have has had to come</p>
<p>from the Bitcoin ecosystem</p>
<p>by virtue of kind of starting out that early.</p>
<p>So I have an unbelievable amount of respect</p>
<p>and admiration and gratitude for Bitcoin</p>
<p>and that it exists and everything that it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>and that it birthed this industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no doubt about that.</p>
<p>At the same time, whatever design decisions people make</p>
<p>are the design decisions they make, right?</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;ve made a design decision</p>
<p>that this ledger and this thing will be about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be about colored coins,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be about op return at 80 bytes,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be about these other kind of nuances</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want this to be about, then that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine and that&rsquo;s a logical decision</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called focus.</p>
<p>And focus has a lot of value</p>
<p>and a lot of great technology products</p>
<p>have focused on something and done that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of smart people around Bitcoin</p>
<p>building kind of additional systems</p>
<p>that anchor their security within Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an interesting approach</p>
<p>that could bear fruit.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll eventually require an interaction</p>
<p>with a Bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways.</p>
<p>And then there will be another question of,</p>
<p>what is the design decision for Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Is it that Bitcoin will be just about the Bitcoin ledger?</p>
<p>Or does Bitcoin want to evolve</p>
<p>into an anchor for all these other systems</p>
<p>and maybe create additional data store,</p>
<p>kind of more data on chain,</p>
<p>on the Bitcoin blockchain related to that?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited to see how that evolves,</p>
<p>but until then kind of results speak for themselves</p>
<p>and the results that Bitcoin has achieved</p>
<p>for our industry and for itself</p>
<p>as kind of the dominant cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and the conception of our industry</p>
<p>that people interact with first</p>
<p>is obviously very important and something</p>
<p>that I think really everybody in our industry</p>
<p>is grateful for, right?</p>
<p>Because without Bitcoin, where would our industry be?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obviously something that we can&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Ethereum</p>
<p>in the chain link distributed Oracle network world?</p>
<p>Is it competition?</p>
<p>Is it collaboration?</p>
<p>Is it complimentary technology?</p>
<p>What do you think about Ethereum?</p>
<p>How much do you think about Ethereum?</p>
<p>What role does it have?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think about a lot.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re completely complimentary.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no competitive dynamics in my opinion.</p>
<p>We are completely collaborative and complimentary</p>
<p>with Ethereum and all other blockchains</p>
<p>and all other layer twos that operate a contract, right?</p>
<p>So we do not seek to operate a smart contract.</p>
<p>We seek to augment and enable smart contracts</p>
<p>to go further in what they&rsquo;re able to do.</p>
<p>In fact, Oracle networks have some value,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have nearly as much value in what they do</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t a mission critical system</p>
<p>like a smart contract that needs their data, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve made our own explicit design decisions</p>
<p>in our own and created our own focus</p>
<p>around guaranteeing that smart contracts can go further.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already done that, right?</p>
<p>Decentralized finance, the rate at which we put data</p>
<p>is to a degree the rate at which certain</p>
<p>decentralized financial markets grow.</p>
<p>And as we put more data, we see more</p>
<p>financial products go live, gaming, we provide VRF.</p>
<p>So we have this kind of focus and it&rsquo;s a very useful</p>
<p>and valuable kind of, valuable for our industry focus.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think that smart contract platforms</p>
<p>like Ethereum made a different set of design decisions</p>
<p>from Bitcoin and others.</p>
<p>And they focused on creating the smart contract capability</p>
<p>and they kind of wanted that functionality to exist.</p>
<p>And I think since then, there&rsquo;s been a number of people</p>
<p>that try to improve on that or try to make variants of that.</p>
<p>From our point of view, we want to support smart contracts</p>
<p>in all of their variations and in all of their use cases.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I personally like about Chainlink</p>
<p>is their ability or Chainlink&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>and the Chainlink network&rsquo;s ability to be useful</p>
<p>to many different chains and across many different use cases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally a fan of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well.</p>
<p>Ethereum took us from a world where it literally took months</p>
<p>to make a new smart contract by being forced</p>
<p>to code it into a protocol.</p>
<p>You had to go to the protocol developers</p>
<p>and you had to say, hey, I need a DEX</p>
<p>or I need some kind of smart contract.</p>
<p>Put it in the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Put it in the actual blockchain mining</p>
<p>and kind of block generation, transaction generation protocol.</p>
<p>That would take months or sometimes even over a year.</p>
<p>That was a horrible experience</p>
<p>and obviously very few people wanted to participate in that</p>
<p>and so very few people made smart contracts,</p>
<p>which I was not a fan of, right?</p>
<p>And then Ethereum came along</p>
<p>and really did a lot of innovative things</p>
<p>and introduced this approach to scriptable smart contracts</p>
<p>where you could script all of these different conditions.</p>
<p>And I found that fascinating before Ethereum.</p>
<p>I found that fascinating once Ethereum</p>
<p>arrived, I found it fascinating after Ethereum launched</p>
<p>and I still find it fascinating.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also very grateful to Vitalik</p>
<p>and the Ethereum community and all the core developers there</p>
<p>for taking our industry a step further.</p>
<p>So I think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit</p>
<p>for taking our industry from it takes months</p>
<p>to make a really small smart contract</p>
<p>to it takes weeks to make a relatively secure,</p>
<p>relatively advanced piece of on chain code</p>
<p>that anybody can script and people can do audits on</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an unbelievable leap forward for our industry</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m genuinely grateful to them for that.</p>
<p>I think the next step in line with our body of work</p>
<p>is how does that scriptable on chain code</p>
<p>become more advanced in its interaction</p>
<p>with all of the systems and events in the real world,</p>
<p>which is in my opinion, the final missing piece</p>
<p>of the puzzle, right?</p>
<p>So my body of work, the body of work that I&rsquo;m involved in</p>
<p>would not be where it is right now</p>
<p>without Bitcoin by any measure.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even be where it is now without Ethereum</p>
<p>and the growth in smart contract development</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>And now what I think is gonna happen next</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;ll be a lot of different smart contract platforms,</p>
<p>a lot of different layer twos,</p>
<p>some of them will be private for enterprise,</p>
<p>some of them will be public,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be some public winners in certain geographies</p>
<p>for maybe regulation reasons, maybe other reasons,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be other public winners, the larger internet,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a number of different people</p>
<p>building smart contracts in different languages.</p>
<p>We are excited and I am excited</p>
<p>and the Chainlink community is excited</p>
<p>and basically there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>I mean, for lack of a better word, excitement</p>
<p>in seeing our industry graduate</p>
<p>to providing more use cases,</p>
<p>more usable hybrid smart contracts, right?</p>
<p>Because once again, it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing</p>
<p>that Bitcoin created non governmental fiat money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unbelievable innovation</p>
<p>and invented decentralized infrastructure</p>
<p>and birthed our industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unbelievably great achievement,</p>
<p>an amazing achievement that we now have</p>
<p>scriptable smart contracts through something like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Once again, monumental achievement in my opinion.</p>
<p>Once again, we still need to look to the future.</p>
<p>We need to look to how do we take</p>
<p>the decentralized infrastructure concepts</p>
<p>that Bitcoin initially put forward,</p>
<p>that Ethereum then improved upon</p>
<p>and created into these scriptable smart contract formats,</p>
<p>and how do we expand that into the world</p>
<p>of real world outcomes to change</p>
<p>the global financial industry, the global trade industry,</p>
<p>the global data marketplace industry,</p>
<p>and many other global industries.</p>
<p>You mentioned results speak for themselves</p>
<p>and how design decisions have consequences.</p>
<p>The Chainlink community have come up</p>
<p>with a lot of brilliant designs.</p>
<p>So how do you think through the design choices</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re facing where you can&rsquo;t predict the future,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re trying to create a better future?</p>
<p>Is there something low level introspective advice</p>
<p>that you can give or describe</p>
<p>as to how you think through those decisions</p>
<p>or high level how you think about those decisions?</p>
<p>Sure, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And I think that actually gets to the core</p>
<p>of what the Chainlink network is supposed to achieve.</p>
<p>We are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system.</p>
<p>So once again, this is the big difference</p>
<p>between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general</p>
<p>and blockchains in my opinion.</p>
<p>Blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible, right?</p>
<p>They say, here&rsquo;s my block size,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the transaction types you can put in those blocks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the contract language I have.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s kind of my blockchain system, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the fee structure for those blocks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna keep getting kind of composed,</p>
<p>transactions are gonna get put into blocks,</p>
<p>blocks will get connected and it&rsquo;ll continue, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very focused type of system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And that makes sense because it&rsquo;s focused</p>
<p>on creating security for that category</p>
<p>of on chain activity, which is once again,</p>
<p>a critical, critical part of building</p>
<p>a highly transparent system and something</p>
<p>that Chainlink enables and doesn&rsquo;t compete with</p>
<p>and just enables to do more.</p>
<p>Oracle networks, conversely, have to interact</p>
<p>with all the world&rsquo;s data and provide all the services</p>
<p>that blockchains don&rsquo;t provide, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of a spectrum.</p>
<p>On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains</p>
<p>that are highly secure, highly reliable,</p>
<p>highly tamper proof, highly transparent,</p>
<p>but are not very feature rich.</p>
<p>For example, they cannot talk to an API.</p>
<p>Many of them can&rsquo;t generate randomness.</p>
<p>They cannot do some kind of privacy preserving computation.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very secure.</p>
<p>And there are these kind of data structures</p>
<p>and smart contract platforms to hold on chain code</p>
<p>that can define conditions, receive value,</p>
<p>pay value back out under conditions</p>
<p>and create transparency around all that,</p>
<p>which makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s oracles and oracle networks.</p>
<p>That is all the world&rsquo;s data, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about taking all the world&rsquo;s data</p>
<p>and making it consumable for all the world&rsquo;s use cases</p>
<p>that have trust issues.</p>
<p>So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>needs to meet is gonna vary very widely</p>
<p>from an insurance contract to a lending contract</p>
<p>to an ad network contract to the data sales contract</p>
<p>that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts.</p>
<p>So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>to flexibly address all of those requirements</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>So flexibility is the goal,</p>
<p>whereas with on chain like Bitcoin,</p>
<p>flexibility is the enemy in the sense</p>
<p>that you want security, you want the focus there.</p>
<p>And in that kind of world,</p>
<p>design decisions have huge consequences.</p>
<p>And then if you look at the distributed oracle network side,</p>
<p>you want to remove the restrictions of design choices.</p>
<p>You want to provide maximal flexibility then.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a completely separate kind of a design framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slightly different problem, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not trying to define transaction types</p>
<p>fitting into blocks on a certain timeline</p>
<p>of those blocks being generated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to say, hey, there&rsquo;s this world of services</p>
<p>or this world of data that&rsquo;s not very deterministic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unbelievably useful</p>
<p>to these smart contracts over here.</p>
<p>And actually they need it to even exist.</p>
<p>And we really want them to exist because once they exist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna completely redefine</p>
<p>what our whole industry is known for, right?</p>
<p>And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg.</p>
<p>And so our goal is to create a framework</p>
<p>and an infrastructure and a software</p>
<p>that allows people to compose</p>
<p>decentralized oracle networks, right?</p>
<p>So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>of seven nodes that goes to three data sources</p>
<p>to trigger your contract worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you could start.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s say your smart contract,</p>
<p>your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars.</p>
<p>Well, then you need to make some changes, right?</p>
<p>You need to go from seven nodes</p>
<p>to 15 or maybe 31 nodes.</p>
<p>And you need to go from three data sources</p>
<p>to five or seven.</p>
<p>And you maybe need to create some kind of</p>
<p>what we call circuit breakers and some other checks.</p>
<p>And you need to make sure</p>
<p>that the decentralized oracle network</p>
<p>comes to consensus around those checks.</p>
<p>Because now the centralized oracle network</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t controlling a million dollars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s controlling a billion dollars.</p>
<p>And we have decentralized oracle networks</p>
<p>that control well over a billion dollars,</p>
<p>multiple billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And we see them growing and getting more advanced</p>
<p>data sources and more advanced features.</p>
<p>And then if somebody else comes and says,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t really wanna make a DeFi product,</p>
<p>I wanna make crop insurance.</p>
<p>And I have a completely different set of conditions.</p>
<p>I want this method of consensus</p>
<p>and I want data to be aggregated in this way,</p>
<p>but not the way that you do</p>
<p>for decentralized financial products.</p>
<p>I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to tell them, no,</p>
<p>our decentralized oracle network can&rsquo;t let you do that.</p>
<p>And you can go and wait another five years</p>
<p>until somebody builds it for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we wanna do, right?</p>
<p>What we wanna do is be able to say,</p>
<p>absolutely, here&rsquo;s an example of how somebody else</p>
<p>made a decentralized oracle network for weather insurance.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a template, change that template,</p>
<p>evolve it to meet your needs.</p>
<p>And then someone else comes and says,</p>
<p>hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?</p>
<p>I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events,</p>
<p>or I wanna do whatever I wanna do</p>
<p>with some kind of sports related data.</p>
<p>Wonderful, here&rsquo;s the framework,</p>
<p>here are your risk dynamics,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a collection of node operators,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a set of preintegrated data sources,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a reputation system to assess</p>
<p>the quality of your ensemble of nodes,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a way to scale that up</p>
<p>as the value in your contract scales.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s all the tools that you need to build this contract.</p>
<p>And what we actually see now as there are multiple types</p>
<p>of computations and data sources that are provided</p>
<p>by different decentralized oracle networks,</p>
<p>of which there are now hundreds,</p>
<p>we now see that a single hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>might use multiple decentralized oracle networks.</p>
<p>So there might be a hybrid smart contract</p>
<p>that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network,</p>
<p>a proof of reserve oracle network,</p>
<p>a randomness oracle network.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re gonna continue to see</p>
<p>this dynamic that more and more advanced contracts</p>
<p>compose various decentralized oracle networks</p>
<p>into more advanced use cases.</p>
<p>And this is the dynamic that we&rsquo;re focused on enabling.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually a very virtuous cycle</p>
<p>for everybody because the more of these</p>
<p>hybrid smart contracts we enable on Ethereum</p>
<p>and other blockchains, the more our industry</p>
<p>provides real world outcomes to the market.</p>
<p>To the larger world, which is at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what I think everybody in our industry wants.</p>
<p>Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts</p>
<p>to become the way that global finance works,</p>
<p>global trade works, global insurance products work,</p>
<p>because they will inherently need both a blockchain</p>
<p>on which the contract itself lives</p>
<p>and an oracle network that powers</p>
<p>all of the other interactions, right?</p>
<p>As a developer, how would you recommend</p>
<p>somebody listening to this, but also me,</p>
<p>to get started with smart contracts</p>
<p>and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?</p>
<p>Well, for hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion.</p>
<p>Please, let me twist your arm.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I think you can go to our YouTube.</p>
<p>We have a number of developer tutorials.</p>
<p>Chainlink YouTube?</p>
<p>Yeah, Chainlink.</p>
<p>I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube,</p>
<p>you should find it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon</p>
<p>where we had a huge amount of very kind of</p>
<p>advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built.</p>
<p>To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon.</p>
<p>Is that something that people can follow along</p>
<p>like a video or there&rsquo;s web page traces of what happened?</p>
<p>Or is there a future actual hackathons</p>
<p>that people could literally participate in?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of more hackathons coming up.</p>
<p>We wanna enable as many developers in web3 and web2</p>
<p>to build hybrid smart contracts</p>
<p>as a way to redefine our industry</p>
<p>and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life.</p>
<p>There are definitely gonna be more hackathons.</p>
<p>So people should go and preregister or register</p>
<p>on a list to get involved in that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great resource where we have a lot of speakers</p>
<p>and a lot of educational tools.</p>
<p>They happen over a course of weeks, not days.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long time for people to work on these things</p>
<p>at the speed that they find comfortable.</p>
<p>Two questions.</p>
<p>One, is there a kind of hello world entry point</p>
<p>for hybrid smart contracts?</p>
<p>And two, on the hackathon side,</p>
<p>what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?</p>
<p>Just kind of getting their feet wet</p>
<p>in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s unbelievable things</p>
<p>that we see people building.</p>
<p>I think how to get your feet wet,</p>
<p>I think the hello world is probably DeFi</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a large amount of data sources</p>
<p>that we already have putting data on chain on test net,</p>
<p>which is the test environment in which people would build.</p>
<p>So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree</p>
<p>the most exciting for certain people</p>
<p>and pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials</p>
<p>and the amount of contracts</p>
<p>to see how people have already built it.</p>
<p>I think beyond that,</p>
<p>we see people building amazing things at these hackathons.</p>
<p>In the previous hackathon,</p>
<p>we saw somebody build a smart contract</p>
<p>that allows someone to rent out their Tesla.</p>
<p>So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access</p>
<p>and rent out someone&rsquo;s Tesla</p>
<p>on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating payment,</p>
<p>which was kind of amazing.</p>
<p>The more recent hackathon,</p>
<p>we saw something called Dbridge,</p>
<p>which is a cross chain solution that uses Oracle networks</p>
<p>to confirm data on different chains.</p>
<p>So I think the things that people build</p>
<p>will just become expansive and varied</p>
<p>in ways that I can&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>
<p>But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list</p>
<p>of different kind of winners in different categories.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many different categories.</p>
<p>We even have a GovTech category</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>If people wanna see what&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>they can go look at the winners.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably a good idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;ll be on the side of the hackathon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a blog related to that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have more of these.</p>
<p>And once again, our explicit goal</p>
<p>is to take our industry into this world</p>
<p>of hybrid smart contracts, which just benefits everybody.</p>
<p>It makes more on chain activity.</p>
<p>It helps provide real world value to the average person</p>
<p>from all of this infrastructure period.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think that it just redefines what our industry is about</p>
<p>through use cases, right?</p>
<p>Because if you only learn through our industry</p>
<p>from the point of view of a single use case,</p>
<p>like the NFT use case or some other use case,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what our industry is about.</p>
<p>And the more of these use cases</p>
<p>that people can make available to the average person</p>
<p>or to the FinTech world or to the insurance world</p>
<p>or wherever, the faster our industry will not just be</p>
<p>about Bitcoins or tokens,</p>
<p>it will be about changing global finance,</p>
<p>changing global insurance, changing global trade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the change in the world</p>
<p>that I and a lot of other people in this industry,</p>
<p>I think, got into this for.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s funny, you&rsquo;ve mentioned about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin</p>
<p>and Ethereum as important technology</p>
<p>that paved the way for the future.</p>
<p>And you somehow did not mention</p>
<p>one of the most profound pieces of technology,</p>
<p>which is Dogecoin.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this particular</p>
<p>revolutionary technology?</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts about Dogecoin</p>
<p>going to the moon, to Mars,</p>
<p>and outside of the solar system?</p>
<p>I think Dogecoin is a very interesting kind of,</p>
<p>probably closer to a social experiment than anything else.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t everything a social experiment?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s fair to a degree.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fascinating how that&rsquo;s evolved.</p>
<p>I think the people that made it</p>
<p>with certain goals in mind</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s kind of taken on a life of its own.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully understand exactly why it&rsquo;s taken on a life</p>
<p>of its own at this point.</p>
<p>I once again, I don&rsquo;t spend too much time</p>
<p>thinking about different tokens and how they&rsquo;re evolving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more focused on the launching and&hellip;</p>
<p>The technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin</p>
<p>is how technology that leverages social dynamics,</p>
<p>that technology&rsquo;s ability to utilize fun and memes to spread.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it should be discounted as a&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I tweeted today something</p>
<p>about like the fundamental force field of fun.</p>
<p>That fun has an effect on the space time.</p>
<p>So general relativity describes how mass and energy</p>
<p>can curve space time. And I was just giving an example</p>
<p>that when life is fun, it seems short.</p>
<p>When life is not fun, it seems very long.</p>
<p>So fun has a very similar effect on space time,</p>
<p>like in curved space time.</p>
<p>In that same sense, there is a power to the meme.</p>
<p>And I think Dogecoin illustrates that.</p>
<p>I think Elon is an example of somebody that uses Dogecoin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know his philosophy in particular on this aspect,</p>
<p>but he does use Dogecoin.</p>
<p>But he does use it effectively to excite the world</p>
<p>in a fun way about the possibilities</p>
<p>of future technologies like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I think the Bitcoin world is very serious right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken about Bitcoin maximalists.</p>
<p>There is very little space for fun and joking</p>
<p>in the Bitcoin world, but there&rsquo;s still a little bit of fun</p>
<p>and humor left in the Dogecoin world.</p>
<p>In that sense, I think it&rsquo;s exceptionally powerful</p>
<p>to inspire, to excite, to be able to talk about stuff</p>
<p>without the seriousness of financial impact</p>
<p>that now certain cryptocurrencies have like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So I keep an eye on, I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned</p>
<p>that Dogecoin I think is a fascinating piece of technology</p>
<p>because I do think cryptocurrency is much bigger</p>
<p>than the technology that you focus on.</p>
<p>There is also a social element that you also spoke to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think not quite yet understood</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating to watch, especially as it covalls</p>
<p>with the different tools on the internet,</p>
<p>the different social networks,</p>
<p>social network mechanisms on the internet.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge supporter of Dogecoin</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a huge supporter of fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated to see how it&rsquo;ll work out.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;ll go to the moon?</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;ll be the first cryptocurrency</p>
<p>to land on the moon?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the analysis as I&rsquo;ve said before.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the analysis.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, no matter what,</p>
<p>I do hope we will get humans back on the moon</p>
<p>and hopefully get humans on Mars soon.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, Bitcoin or not.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about books and movies.</p>
<p>What books and movies in your life long ago</p>
<p>when you were a baby Sergei or today had an impact on you?</p>
<p>Maybe you would recommend to others</p>
<p>and maybe what ideas you took away from those books,</p>
<p>movies, coloring books, children&rsquo;s books, blogs, whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>So I think one of the things that had a very big impact</p>
<p>on me were Plato&rsquo;s dialogues</p>
<p>and particularly Protagoras and Gorgias</p>
<p>as some of the two initial ones.</p>
<p>I think what Plato&rsquo;s dialogues do very well</p>
<p>is they give people a clear picture of what dialogue looks</p>
<p>like and what the assessment</p>
<p>of information probably should look like, right?</p>
<p>And how the dissection and analysis</p>
<p>of an idea is very important</p>
<p>and how it can actually be taken in either direction.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day that the process</p>
<p>of eliminating kind of this fuzzy thinking</p>
<p>and arriving at whether it&rsquo;s an external dialogue</p>
<p>or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture</p>
<p>of reality is actually very important.</p>
<p>And so I think I&rsquo;m very lucky to have read the dialogues</p>
<p>when I was in my early teenage years</p>
<p>and it had a very large impact on me</p>
<p>because it kind of showed me that nobody knows</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I would play out dialogues in my mind</p>
<p>and I would engage in certain dialogues</p>
<p>with different people.</p>
<p>And what the Platonic dialogue showed me was kind</p>
<p>of how to tell when someone has no clue.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are very good</p>
<p>at kind of say they have a clue, right?</p>
<p>Saying like, here&rsquo;s how the world works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do with your life.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do with your time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do with your money.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do with your attention.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do with all these things.</p>
<p>And I think the ability to evaluate information</p>
<p>generally is something that is surprisingly under taught.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually understand why there isn&rsquo;t a course</p>
<p>in like high schools or universities</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like, here is how you evaluate information.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you engage in external dialogue</p>
<p>and internal dialogue to arrive</p>
<p>at an accurate picture of reality</p>
<p>rather than the picture of reality</p>
<p>that other people want you to have</p>
<p>for their benefit most often, right?</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think that put me down a path</p>
<p>to really try and understand.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think biographies</p>
<p>have had a very large impact on me.</p>
<p>Plutarchs, Greek and Roman lives.</p>
<p>After I read Plato,</p>
<p>I started reading a bunch of stuff, Greek stuff.</p>
<p>I was just like, these Greek guys,</p>
<p>they really know how it is.</p>
<p>They did this 2000 years ago and they still got it right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this like a theory of time around them,</p>
<p>the value of intellectual ideas, right?</p>
<p>If an intellectual idea has survived the test of time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more valuable than the intellectual idea</p>
<p>that I just came up with 10 minutes ago,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t told anybody and hasn&rsquo;t gone up against</p>
<p>all of the kind of rebuttals.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your favorite,</p>
<p>what would you say would be a most impactful biography</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve come across?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was those Greek or Roman biographies</p>
<p>because they were very far away.</p>
<p>I think that probably one of the most impactful ones</p>
<p>that I can remember recently is around Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>And so Vanderbilt was this guy who basically,</p>
<p>without that much of an education,</p>
<p>he would invent or work with people</p>
<p>to make these steamboats.</p>
<p>And then he had a lot of acumen</p>
<p>around creating certain monopolies,</p>
<p>regardless of what was right or wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Right or wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>And then fascinating enough,</p>
<p>it all hinged on like a Supreme Court case</p>
<p>that decided if monopolies were acceptable</p>
<p>in the form of state created monopolies or not.</p>
<p>And if it was deemed that state created monopolies</p>
<p>were acceptable, he would have had a huge problem, this guy.</p>
<p>But it was deemed that state created monopolies</p>
<p>through these licenses for steamboat routes</p>
<p>was not acceptable.</p>
<p>And that did two interesting things that unseated</p>
<p>some kind of old time landed gentry in the Americas</p>
<p>in like the 1830s and 40s.</p>
<p>And it basically made him right</p>
<p>and he saw it before other people.</p>
<p>So I think Vanderbilt was a very interesting personality,</p>
<p>first of all, of all the biographies that I read</p>
<p>is somebody who really took the situation in hand</p>
<p>and kind of took action to achieve an outcome,</p>
<p>which I think was an amazing result.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing, by the way,</p>
<p>is, or amazing way of looking at things.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing, by the way,</p>
<p>is that the ferries now in New York Harbor</p>
<p>are all run as a public good.</p>
<p>So the fascinating thing is that the guy,</p>
<p>he focused on an industry and he worked on something</p>
<p>that was so important that it ended up</p>
<p>becoming a public good.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s an interesting conception</p>
<p>of how to look at this industry.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of economics dynamics</p>
<p>around this industry,</p>
<p>but I think I might&rsquo;ve said this somewhere else before,</p>
<p>but really the success of someone in this industry</p>
<p>is whether they&rsquo;re able to make a Linux or HTTP</p>
<p>or an HTTPS like system that lives on for a very long time</p>
<p>and is essentially a kind of public good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a success of an idea,</p>
<p>even if that idea is originally sort of a capitalist idea</p>
<p>above that&rsquo;s grounded in financial benefit.</p>
<p>Success of it is if it becomes a public good.</p>
<p>It is so universal.</p>
<p>It is so fundamental to the quality of life</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a public good.</p>
<p>It is deemed to be so valuable</p>
<p>that it should be a public good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty,</p>
<p>a pretty good definition of success that you work</p>
<p>on a body of work and that body of work</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just some commercial enterprise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a body of work that whatever commercial aspects</p>
<p>or economic incentive aspects it might have,</p>
<p>it eventually is so important</p>
<p>that it becomes critical to how society functions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally quite lucky and grateful to be,</p>
<p>in my opinion, working on something like that</p>
<p>with an amazing team and an amazing community</p>
<p>that seems to really very much care</p>
<p>about this hybrid smart contract transparent world</p>
<p>that a lot of people on our industry,</p>
<p>realistically, I think this is why a lot of them signed up.</p>
<p>This is why I came into our industry.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because Bitcoin,</p>
<p>it was because Bitcoin was a picture</p>
<p>of how the world could work in so many other ways.</p>
<p>And that picture of how the world could work</p>
<p>in so many other ways attracted me a very long time ago.</p>
<p>And I think that all of this stuff</p>
<p>will eventually become a public good.</p>
<p>I think it will become so critical</p>
<p>to how societies function internally and internationally</p>
<p>that just like there are systems,</p>
<p>like the Federal Reserve, like global payment systems,</p>
<p>like all these types of things,</p>
<p>I think eventually all of this technology</p>
<p>will be baked into these societally critical systems.</p>
<p>And if I, in our community and the people I work with</p>
<p>and the body of work that we&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>can make some kind of contribution to that shift</p>
<p>towards a fairer, economically fair, transparent society,</p>
<p>from my point of view, it&rsquo;s a very worthwhile body of work.</p>
<p>In terms of the show, you also mentioned the show,</p>
<p>one of the shows that I really seem to like more and more</p>
<p>for some reason is Star Trek, not the old Star Trek.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get the old Star Trek.</p>
<p>The special effects aren&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>Star Trek, like The Next Generation and Voyager</p>
<p>and Deep Space Nine and all those.</p>
<p>I think whenever I happen to watch a Star Trek show again,</p>
<p>I have a very simple conception in my mind</p>
<p>that I really didn&rsquo;t have whenever I saw it way back when.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m not a fan of Star Trek.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that this is what the world looks like</p>
<p>if technology takes us towards a utopia, right?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s this fascinating thing</p>
<p>where technology can take us towards a utopia</p>
<p>or towards a dystopia.</p>
<p>And in my mind, those kind of three Star Trek shows</p>
<p>are a picture of what human civilization looks like</p>
<p>if everybody&rsquo;s technological ambitions</p>
<p>successfully take us towards a utopia, right?</p>
<p>Because in the Star Trek universe,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeking money or you&rsquo;re not seeking safety</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not really seeking anything for yourself.</p>
<p>Everybody within Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs</p>
<p>has gotten so many things for themselves</p>
<p>that their goal is learning and discovering and or helping.</p>
<p>And I think there is this conception of human life</p>
<p>once the baser needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what technology generally can elevate</p>
<p>all of human civilization to, right?</p>
<p>It can elevate us to Star Trek world</p>
<p>where if people want to invent,</p>
<p>they can do that all day and nothing else.</p>
<p>If people wanna explore the stars,</p>
<p>they can explore the stars</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have to worry about economic scarcity</p>
<p>or any number of these other conceptions.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the most impactful on me shows have been</p>
<p>but for some reason recently Star Trek</p>
<p>in the newer variant,</p>
<p>not the most new Star Trek shows.</p>
<p>Those shows are a little strange.</p>
<p>The kind of middle Star Trek universe</p>
<p>where everybody is doing something</p>
<p>with like a very important purpose</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s thinking about like,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my paycheck or where&rsquo;s my whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all kind of like,</p>
<p>we have to discover the formula to this</p>
<p>to save the planet over there.</p>
<p>And literally every episode you&rsquo;re discovering a formula</p>
<p>to save a planet, right?</p>
<p>Of some kind or a universe or ecosystem or whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking at it, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, this is like,</p>
<p>this is a pretty good place to end up.</p>
<p>This is where we might wanna end up.</p>
<p>So it gives you hope.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s funny that we don&rsquo;t often think about the,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very useful to think about positive visions</p>
<p>of the future when we&rsquo;re trying to design technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of sort of in public discourse,</p>
<p>a lot of people are thinking about</p>
<p>kind of how everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to think about that sometimes,</p>
<p>but in moderation, I think,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not enough in my little corner</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence world,</p>
<p>people are very kind of fear monger centered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of discussions</p>
<p>about how everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>Important to do, but it&rsquo;s also really important</p>
<p>to talk about how things can go right,</p>
<p>because we ultimately want to guide the design</p>
<p>of the systems we create to make things right.</p>
<p>And I think with hope and optimism,</p>
<p>not naiveness, but optimism,</p>
<p>you can actually create a better world.</p>
<p>Like you have to think about a positive,</p>
<p>a better world as you create,</p>
<p>because then you can actually create it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m one of the people that thinks</p>
<p>that having an optimistic view of the world</p>
<p>is better for design and creativity</p>
<p>than having a pessimistic one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to design when you&rsquo;re in fear.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people,</p>
<p>speaking of being excited about</p>
<p>and hopeful about the future world,</p>
<p>do you have advice for young people today</p>
<p>in computer science world,</p>
<p>in software engineering world, in crypto world,</p>
<p>but maybe in any world whatsoever for life,</p>
<p>how to pick a career or how to live life in general?</p>
<p>I think the thing that young people should do</p>
<p>is not any one specific thing</p>
<p>for any one specific young person.</p>
<p>I think what they should do is what they won&rsquo;t be able to do</p>
<p>in the later stages of their life.</p>
<p>And the way, in my opinion,</p>
<p>from a framework point of view to think about that</p>
<p>is that the amount of obligations</p>
<p>and the amount of time that a person has</p>
<p>seems to just diminish over time, right?</p>
<p>So the amount of free time they have, right?</p>
<p>So you start your job,</p>
<p>you get a bunch of responsibilities,</p>
<p>something with your partner or spouse,</p>
<p>more responsibilities,</p>
<p>kids, probably even more responsibilities,</p>
<p>and soon enough, the time that you have to educate yourself,</p>
<p>to travel, to experience the world however,</p>
<p>create whatever creative endeavor you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>slowly but surely disappears.</p>
<p>I think this is something</p>
<p>that young people don&rsquo;t fully realize.</p>
<p>They assume that the world as it is now</p>
<p>and the amount of free time that they have to travel,</p>
<p>to educate themselves, to make new friends,</p>
<p>to do all these things,</p>
<p>will somehow maybe diminish by 10%.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t diminish by 10%, it will diminish by 90%.</p>
<p>And the 10% that you have,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be resting to get back to work and get things done.</p>
<p>So what I think young people should do,</p>
<p>and this is why it&rsquo;s very different for each of them, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell young people,</p>
<p>hey, you should study philosophy, travel,</p>
<p>and start your own enterprise to achieve something</p>
<p>worthwhile in the world, right?</p>
<p>That might be something that&rsquo;s good for me</p>
<p>with my values and my kind of worldview,</p>
<p>but for other people might be something else.</p>
<p>I think the way that they should conceptualize it</p>
<p>is imagine if over the next 10, 12 years,</p>
<p>the amount of choice that you had about what you could do</p>
<p>was cut down by 90%.</p>
<p>What would you, and this is copying from this kind of</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos regret minimization framework.</p>
<p>In that framework, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what would I regret not doing at 80?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of meant to create this longterm view</p>
<p>and make these decisions now that&rsquo;ll get you</p>
<p>to a longterm future that you can look back on</p>
<p>and be proud of your life, right?</p>
<p>What I think young people should do</p>
<p>is they should say to themselves,</p>
<p>look, if I never get the chance to travel</p>
<p>for as long as I live,</p>
<p>assuming that after 25, after 27, after 29,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the case, how will I feel about that?</p>
<p>If I never get to start a company after 25,</p>
<p>after I get married, after I have kids,</p>
<p>how will I feel about that?</p>
<p>And whatever they feel the worst about</p>
<p>is what they should do.</p>
<p>Whatever they feel like when they say to themselves,</p>
<p>you know, if I don&rsquo;t travel now, I will never travel.</p>
<p>And they feel horrible about that.</p>
<p>They just have an overwhelming fear</p>
<p>and disgust at themselves in that type of state</p>
<p>at 25, 27, 29, that&rsquo;s what they should do.</p>
<p>And they shouldn&rsquo;t listen to anybody else.</p>
<p>Let me put it to you this way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really smart, you&rsquo;re gonna make it anyway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid whether you&rsquo;re gonna make it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really smart, you&rsquo;re gonna make it anyway.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not really smart, you&rsquo;re screwed anyway.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Either way, just relax with it and use your time well</p>
<p>to do the things you would most regret not doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say relax.</p>
<p>I would say very much cherish the free time,</p>
<p>the discretionary time that you have</p>
<p>from the age of 18 to maybe 25.</p>
<p>Because at 25, everyone&rsquo;s gonna start looking at each other</p>
<p>and asking, what have I achieved?</p>
<p>Like my friends have achieved, I haven&rsquo;t achieved.</p>
<p>And then by the time you get to 30,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna look at each other again and go,</p>
<p>well, my friends have a family or a company</p>
<p>or a PhD or a whatever, what do I have?</p>
<p>And the pressure will just increase.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll increase so much that even if you want to go</p>
<p>and do the fun thing, it will not be fun.</p>
<p>Because the pressure of comparing yourself</p>
<p>to your friends at 25 or your peers at 30</p>
<p>will be so great that it will no longer be normal</p>
<p>for you to be in a hostel at 30,</p>
<p>kind of like living it up.</p>
<p>And this is why I also can&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>specifically what it is.</p>
<p>For me, it was getting an education in philosophy</p>
<p>that was rigorous and in depth.</p>
<p>It was traveling and it was starting an enterprise</p>
<p>that I thought that was worthwhile, that I directed,</p>
<p>that I could make into something great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it was for me.</p>
<p>For other people, it might be something with a band,</p>
<p>it might be something with painting,</p>
<p>it might be an education.</p>
<p>You, by the way, also should not assume</p>
<p>that your ability to get an education will improve.</p>
<p>All of those responsibilities will take away</p>
<p>your ability to get an education.</p>
<p>So if you value having an education,</p>
<p>if you value being a deeply educated, well rounded person</p>
<p>with a wide array of knowledge on a wide array of topics,</p>
<p>capitalism will force you to specialize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s good at, it&rsquo;s gonna take you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna fashion you into a very specific tool</p>
<p>for a very, most people, into a very specific set of tasks.</p>
<p>If you want to have an education in something, get it now.</p>
<p>If you wanna travel somewhere, travel there now.</p>
<p>If you wanna do some kind of creative endeavor</p>
<p>that you doubt whether you&rsquo;ll have time for in the future,</p>
<p>do it now.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t have time for it in the future,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have time to read philosophy books all day,</p>
<p>unfortunately, you won&rsquo;t have time to fly to Italy</p>
<p>and kind of hang out with people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get more responsibilities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get more stuff to do.</p>
<p>And so my advice to you is do not piss away</p>
<p>this rare, unique, discretionary time.</p>
<p>And if your friends are, get new friends.</p>
<p>Get smarter friends, get people who are using</p>
<p>the limited time they have better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my advice.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a quickly comment, it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>You know, to reframe high school</p>
<p>and undergraduate college education,</p>
<p>sometimes people wanna quickly get it over with.</p>
<p>But one thing I remember thinking,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very true about high school,</p>
<p>is one of the only times in your life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a chance to truly get a broad education.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often think of it that way,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a chance to really enjoy learning things</p>
<p>that are outside of the specialty</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll eventually end up with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how college education is.</p>
<p>And on a more fun side, I played music,</p>
<p>I did martial arts, and we offline mentioned</p>
<p>played video games.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating and brilliant what you said,</p>
<p>which is the world will not give you a chance</p>
<p>to truly enjoy many of these things</p>
<p>and truly get value from many of those things</p>
<p>once you get older.</p>
<p>I find it exceptionally difficult to enjoy video games now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much stuff to do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much responsibility.</p>
<p>And I, at the time when I played Elder Scrolls</p>
<p>and Baldur&rsquo;s Gate and Diablo II,</p>
<p>and at the time I thought maybe that was a waste of time.</p>
<p>But now looking back, I realize,</p>
<p>because I always thought,</p>
<p>let me get the career first</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll have a chance to play video games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I was thinking.</p>
<p>It was a waste of time</p>
<p>because I should really progress on the career</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll have time to play video games.</p>
<p>No, the reality is that was really fulfilling.</p>
<p>Those are some of the happiest travel experiences</p>
<p>of my life is me traveling to those virtual worlds</p>
<p>and spending time in them.</p>
<p>And it was really fulfilling</p>
<p>and they stayed with me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>And I get to experience echoes of that</p>
<p>when I play video games these days</p>
<p>for an hour here, an hour there,</p>
<p>like one hour a month or something like that.</p>
<p>But even those experiences, as silly as they are,</p>
<p>they seem like a waste of time at the time,</p>
<p>enjoying them fully, unapologetically.</p>
<p>And in a framework exactly as you said,</p>
<p>would I regret being the kind of person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve never played those video games?</p>
<p>And I can, for myself, honestly say that yes.</p>
<p>Look, when I&rsquo;m on my death bed,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I built Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 2</p>
<p>and all those arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind</p>
<p>and all the Elder Scrolls games.</p>
<p>And yeah, the things that don&rsquo;t necessarily fit</p>
<p>into this kind of storyline</p>
<p>of what a career is supposed to be,</p>
<p>travel and all those experiences that you mentioned.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d just like to say one final quick thing on this.</p>
<p>I think this extends to really hard things as well.</p>
<p>It extends to the things you wanna do,</p>
<p>but one of the best pieces of advice</p>
<p>one of my mentors gave me early on in my career</p>
<p>around this time is that it will actually become harder</p>
<p>to start a company as you get older.</p>
<p>Once again, because you have more responsibilities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re responsible to your partner for some kind of income</p>
<p>to create a life together.</p>
<p>Once you have kids, you&rsquo;re responsible</p>
<p>for an even greater income to create a life for kids.</p>
<p>And startups do not generate income, right?</p>
<p>They take many, many years before anything happens.</p>
<p>People are getting evicted, people are eating ramen noodles.</p>
<p>That is a thing, that happens, that will happen.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that you should do the fun things</p>
<p>or the enjoyable things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying the things that you would regret not doing,</p>
<p>that you can uniquely do in the time span from 18 to 25.</p>
<p>Which one of which is, if you plan to have a family</p>
<p>and start a family when you&rsquo;re 25,</p>
<p>you should start a company now.</p>
<p>You should not wait until a bunch of people depend on you</p>
<p>for income to eat, to start a company.</p>
<p>The amount of pressure that will be on you at that point</p>
<p>will be monumental.</p>
<p>You should start a company when nobody depends on you</p>
<p>and you can sleep on the floor eating ramen noodles</p>
<p>and still have a great time and show up</p>
<p>with a lot of enthusiasm and be excited.</p>
<p>So I just mean whatever you want to really devote yourself</p>
<p>to and really do, don&rsquo;t put it off.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go to consulting or banking or any other industry</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m gonna do this for three years</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get experience.</p>
<p>The only way you get experience is by doing something.</p>
<p>You go, you do it, you fail, you do it again and again</p>
<p>and again and again and again and then you have experience</p>
<p>and then you can do it right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way experience happens.</p>
<p>There is no other way short of mentorship.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky to get mentorship,</p>
<p>99% of people don&rsquo;t get mentorship.</p>
<p>And even though we&rsquo;re talking about young people,</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re speaking to me as somebody who spent</p>
<p>the last two weeks sleeping on the floor</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no mattress and somebody who is single</p>
<p>and somebody who&rsquo;s thinking about doing a startup,</p>
<p>I felt like you&rsquo;re speaking to me as a fellow young person.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about this whole life of ours</p>
<p>to zoom out on the big philosophical question,</p>
<p>the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re creating all the technology,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re thinking about this future?</p>
<p>You ever zoom out and think like, why?</p>
<p>Why are you surrogate striving?</p>
<p>Why are we the human species striving for the stars?</p>
<p>So I think it comes down to whether people</p>
<p>wanna live in society.</p>
<p>So if people decide to be part of society,</p>
<p>they have a certain set of conditions</p>
<p>that they decide to take part in, right?</p>
<p>So I think what this comes down to is a lot of</p>
<p>really involved conversations.</p>
<p>But if we assume people have free will and choice,</p>
<p>if we just kind of make that blanket assumption,</p>
<p>then the question starts to become,</p>
<p>well, what choices do we make?</p>
<p>And how do we live with those choices?</p>
<p>And I think probably the most fundamental choice</p>
<p>is whether we exist in a society</p>
<p>or we choose to leave society.</p>
<p>And there are people that do this.</p>
<p>There are people that go live in the woods.</p>
<p>There are people that immigrate to other societies</p>
<p>and they make a choice, right?</p>
<p>And as they enter those other societies</p>
<p>or they choose to leave society and go live in the woods,</p>
<p>they adopt a certain set of values, right?</p>
<p>They adopt values that the society prescribes,</p>
<p>they compromise their own values,</p>
<p>they define their own values,</p>
<p>and they create a set of values for themselves, right?</p>
<p>I think at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to choose to live in society,</p>
<p>in addition to all the minimums of not throwing garbage</p>
<p>on the floor and doing nice things for people</p>
<p>that need help and doing any number of things</p>
<p>to just be a normal human being within society,</p>
<p>you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>what am I doing as part of society, right?</p>
<p>You can always say, hey, I&rsquo;m going to leave society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live in the woods.</p>
<p>I did that, right?</p>
<p>I went and I lived in the woods and I gave it a shot,</p>
<p>realized a ton of stuff, huge amount of clarity from that.</p>
<p>But when you decide to live in society,</p>
<p>you take on, first of all, certain minimal agreements.</p>
<p>You mold your values a little bit to that society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another choice that people inherently make.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a question of,</p>
<p>well, what am I doing here, right?</p>
<p>What am I doing in society, right?</p>
<p>So when people say the meaning of life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the meaning of life is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the meaning of life in society.</p>
<p>Right, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life for the choice</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve made within society, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s maybe the first fundamental choice</p>
<p>you made.</p>
<p>You made a choice and you continue</p>
<p>to make a choice to be part of society</p>
<p>and a specific society, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve made this choice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part of a society.</p>
<p>And now you kind of have a life and you have people around you.</p>
<p>And then the question is, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the question is, what is the body of work</p>
<p>that you want to make, right?</p>
<p>I think, personally, that life is kind of so short.</p>
<p>And the ability to get enough resources for yourself</p>
<p>in at least the developed markets</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re lucky to be in is so relatively abundant</p>
<p>that we, you and me, have the luxury,</p>
<p>by your pursuit of a PhD, you&rsquo;ve had this luxury,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this luxury through the work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been doing, to pursue something</p>
<p>that makes society better.</p>
<p>So this is kind of the question, I would say.</p>
<p>The question is, am I going to live in society, yes or no?</p>
<p>Yes, OK.</p>
<p>Most people choose yes.</p>
<p>I understand why, to a degree.</p>
<p>I understand why some people choose no.</p>
<p>And then what is the but?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to be in society.</p>
<p>If you choose to be in society, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just choosing to abide by the rules.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re choosing to just do the minimum, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what being part of society means.</p>
<p>People that choose to be part of society</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t want to do this, it&rsquo;s very confusing.</p>
<p>They should just leave.</p>
<p>They should just go, look, I don&rsquo;t like this deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live in Tibet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live in the woods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live wherever the rules are to my liking, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve chosen to be in society.</p>
<p>Next question, kind of final question,</p>
<p>is what is the body of work that I&rsquo;m going to be involved in?</p>
<p>Because in looking at that Jeff Bezos kind of regret</p>
<p>minimization framework thing, I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what a lot of it really comes down to,</p>
<p>is you kind of, the framework is at 80 years old,</p>
<p>you look back over your life, what would you</p>
<p>regret not doing?</p>
<p>What would you regret not pursuing?</p>
<p>I think there are a number of things on a personal level</p>
<p>each person has, but I think, at least for me,</p>
<p>and probably for many of the other people I know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question of what is the body of work</p>
<p>that I was involved in?</p>
<p>What did I do?</p>
<p>What happened, right?</p>
<p>What was I involved in?</p>
<p>And in my opinion, you should have a good answer to that.</p>
<p>You mentioned the body of work in relation</p>
<p>to whether it helped make a better world.</p>
<p>And the fundamental question there is,</p>
<p>what does better mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our striving to understand what is better.</p>
<p>What kind of world would we love to exist after we&rsquo;re gone?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s another thing,</p>
<p>almost unanswerable question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one we can strive towards,</p>
<p>is what is a better world?</p>
<p>Right, I think that&rsquo;s once again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very personal question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s an objective moral truth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna suddenly give us all an answer.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually quite fascinating to me</p>
<p>when people feel they have this objective moral truth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so sure in their opinions,</p>
<p>this is what we do, we should go hurt them or help them</p>
<p>or kill them or rescue them or whatever, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these kind of very situational specific</p>
<p>kind of like, this is the right thing to do,</p>
<p>the objective moral truth told me that this is it.</p>
<p>But maybe there&rsquo;s a definitive truth</p>
<p>that we can arrive towards sort of a consensus</p>
<p>of what that is within the little local pocket</p>
<p>of society that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>People just then mislabel it</p>
<p>and they go like objective moral truth.</p>
<p>This is not our idea.</p>
<p>This is coming up from on high here.</p>
<p>This is the objective moral truth that,</p>
<p>I think exists in some metaphysical form somewhere.</p>
<p>And then you build a building with marble and it&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>and usually what happens.</p>
<p>And then you convince yourself</p>
<p>that that building represents.</p>
<p>I think those people actually,</p>
<p>the people who build those buildings</p>
<p>probably understand that there is no metaphysical objective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, we&rsquo;re all just coming to consensus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna build the biggest building and you&rsquo;re like me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do, right?</p>
<p>They just look at it that way probably.</p>
<p>I think what ends up happening with all these values is,</p>
<p>yeah, people should determine that for themselves.</p>
<p>I agree that there&rsquo;s a second order question here</p>
<p>of what is the best body of work to work on.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that&rsquo;s probably a mix</p>
<p>of what could you realistically achieve?</p>
<p>Is that gonna have an impact on society</p>
<p>that you feel good about?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>So these are probably the two aspects of this question</p>
<p>and is this gonna have a good impact on society</p>
<p>that you feel good about?</p>
<p>Obviously very subjective, right?</p>
<p>Some people save animals, some people save forests.</p>
<p>We and I are creating this system of economic fairness</p>
<p>and transparency.</p>
<p>I feel that I&rsquo;m in a good position to enable that.</p>
<p>I feel that I have a good chance of succeeding at that.</p>
<p>And I think that the impact will be quite meaningful</p>
<p>for a large number of people.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m completely happy to look back</p>
<p>once I made it and see a body of work that achieved that</p>
<p>and be very proud of that, right?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be doing</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m looking back.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with you.</p>
<p>The scale of impact as a hybrid smart contracts,</p>
<p>this whole idea that you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>has a potential to transform the world for the better</p>
<p>at a scale that I can&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>
<p>So speaking of which means even more</p>
<p>that you would waste so many hours</p>
<p>of that exciting life with me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me, Sergei.</p>
<p>This is a really fascinating conversation,</p>
<p>a really fascinating space, and I can&rsquo;t wait to learn more.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Sergei Nazarov.</p>
<p>And thank you to Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>Indeed, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Copernicus.</p>
<p>To know that we know what we know</p>
<p>and to know that we do not know what we do not know,</p>
<p>that is true knowledge.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
