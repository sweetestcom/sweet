    <p>The following is a conversation with Zach Bitter, ultramarathon runner and coach who held multiple</p>
<p>world records in the 100 mile run and other ultra endurance events. He is currently training for a</p>
<p>run across America, which for now is planned for September this year. Like many of the things Zach</p>
<p>has done in the past, this is a big, fascinating challenge. Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Ladder, Valcampo, Noom, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Zach has been advising and coaching me on my own</p>
<p>running journey. I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra,</p>
<p>which I think is a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on, I feel like Zach is</p>
<p>watching me, and I get that extra motivation to make him proud. And by that, I mean I want to put</p>
<p>a lot of miles on those shoes. Running is something that has always been difficult for me,</p>
<p>but I love it because it is difficult. The hardest part is I&rsquo;m left alone with my thoughts</p>
<p>for one or two hours. Some thoughts are dark, like thinking about mortality, my own and that of</p>
<p>others. Some are self critical, like personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply</p>
<p>human feelings of loneliness, personal and existential. And yet, there are the moments</p>
<p>during a run when all that fades and I&rsquo;m left empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation</p>
<p>for the beauty of experience, of nature, life, the whole thing. This is why I return to running.</p>
<p>Not to get in shape, but to face myself and to run through it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m inspired by people</p>
<p>like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who seek to find the limits of their body</p>
<p>and mind. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Zach Bitter.</p>
<p>Where does your mind go when you&rsquo;re running an ultra marathon? Are there a lot of positive</p>
<p>thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe no thoughts at all? Yeah, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>really interesting part of the sport, I think, because you can essentially what it is when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at like the hundred mile distance or anything that&rsquo;s like all day long is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have the full range of the full spectrum of emotions of mental processes, both kind of</p>
<p>positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like you&rsquo;ve lived multiple, multiple lives</p>
<p>or full life, maybe it was way to say it in that one time period. So it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>assimilation of what you may experience in a long period of time in a very condensed period of time.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just a weird mental process to reflect upon. And that&rsquo;s what kind of draws people</p>
<p>back to it. But I mean, it&rsquo;s a battle, too, because if you&rsquo;re looking at it from a performance</p>
<p>standpoint versus an experience, you obviously want to minimize the negative mindset stuff.</p>
<p>You want to try to keep those emotions and those thought processes at a low. And I think when you</p>
<p>can keep yourself from letting those thoughts creep in, they you end up having better races</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it can spiral in either direction. Like I notice like there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s kind of like this</p>
<p>scenario that occurs where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super easy just to slap it down and say, like, get out of here. You know, I did the training,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fit, I&rsquo;m feeling fresh still. You know, everything&rsquo;s going well at this point in time.</p>
<p>You get a little further along in the race and you&rsquo;re starting to feel a bit of the fatigue,</p>
<p>I mean, a little bit of self doubt creeps in. You start asking yourself, well, you know,</p>
<p>maybe I should have done one more long run or did I did I not quite taper long enough? And those</p>
<p>things can kind of spiral into a negative way. And if if you let it keep going, it keeps going</p>
<p>all the way to like, why am I here? Why am I doing this? This is stupid. All the way to like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another one of these two weeks from now, I&rsquo;m going to drop out of this one and sign up for</p>
<p>that one instead. And then you just find yourself in the exact same situation. So you kind of have</p>
<p>to go through the process, I think is why I think there&rsquo;s kind of a I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a rule of thumb</p>
<p>necessarily, but something I think is fairly valuable is if you do a hundred mile or the first</p>
<p>time, make sure you get it done, even if it means like, you know, death marching is what they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>call it in the alternate community at the end of the race. Just to say, like, you got that full</p>
<p>experience, you experience the highs, the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing the</p>
<p>finish line, that release of emotion when you&rsquo;re done and all that stuff. So that when you go back</p>
<p>to do it again, you have like a template to build off of, then you know, or you just have some data</p>
<p>to pull from about how your mind is going to work as well as your body so that you can start</p>
<p>practicing Well, what do I have to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative direction?</p>
<p>Or how do I catch some positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way, and things like that.</p>
<p>And that just I think, you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of running</p>
<p>them and it sharpens. It&rsquo;s kind of like any sport with that where, you know, you always have this</p>
<p>balance between the youthfulness that you may have earlier in your career versus the wise</p>
<p>intelligence that you have maybe near the end of your career. So in terms of wisdom, is there</p>
<p>mechanisms by which you kind of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have</p>
<p>a people like the David Goggins is who kind of this, he seems to almost like separate his mind</p>
<p>into there&rsquo;s the weak David that he hates. And then there&rsquo;s this strong, strong one. I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a very contentious relationship there. So he basically says, like, I refuse to</p>
<p>be that person. And he&rsquo;s almost like angry at that person. It&rsquo;s almost like sometimes</p>
<p>literally yelling at that person, the weak version of themselves. And then there&rsquo;s another more sort</p>
<p>of Sam Harris the approach, which is like, just observe the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing</p>
<p>that this too shall pass, like no matter what it, this moment will not last forever. And kind of</p>
<p>sort of accepting the natural flow of things and taking one step at a time and allowing whatever</p>
<p>the negativity, whatever the pain you&rsquo;re experiencing just to pass, even if it means a</p>
<p>death march, which one is more effective for you? Which one, like, would you say generally speaking</p>
<p>to the population is more effective? Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good question. It&rsquo;s probably unique to</p>
<p>the individual. I wouldn&rsquo;t argue that, you know, David is finding success with his approach.</p>
<p>Some may argue it&rsquo;s an extreme version. You know, Sam has obviously thought about these things and</p>
<p>really probably, you know, I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the</p>
<p>way that they kind of come across in general, where like David&rsquo;s like really at your kind of</p>
<p>high energy and Sam&rsquo;s kind of this calming, soft presence and he&rsquo;s just going to slowly,</p>
<p>methodically lay it all out there. And I think there&rsquo;s value on in both of those. I think</p>
<p>most people are probably going to get a benefit from pulling some from each. I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>times where, where I need a kick in the ass and then it&rsquo;s like, have the strong Zach, tell the</p>
<p>weak Zach to get moving. But there&rsquo;s also times where, you know, it&rsquo;s just like, you know, a</p>
<p>subtle voice entering my head about, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if I feel quite right now. Should I</p>
<p>maybe pull back on the pace? And I think that little subtle voice is best approached with a</p>
<p>subtle positive voice where it&rsquo;s more like, okay, well let&rsquo;s think this through here for a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You spent four months preparing for it.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, from the workouts you did that you&rsquo;re ready for this, there really isn&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>real reason for you to slow down or to fall off your goal or your pace or, you know, reassess</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing. Let&rsquo;s just give this another mile or two. And then we can reassess if we need</p>
<p>to, and in order to kind of figure out if I&rsquo;m doing the right things or not. And I think like</p>
<p>in that situation, um, you definitely probably want to lean more towards the Sam Harris approach</p>
<p>with that because there&rsquo;s really no reason to, it&rsquo;s almost like the same thing you see with like</p>
<p>just training and even nutrition to a degree where like some folks, they just want to be like,</p>
<p>kind of like drilled. They want to be like yelled at and said, like, get going, get doing this. And</p>
<p>that helps and that motivates them. That helps them stay accountable. Other people need some</p>
<p>softer love with it where it&rsquo;s like, you know, this isn&rsquo;t necessarily your thought, your, your</p>
<p>fault. You were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and</p>
<p>lethargy and maybe poor nutritional choices and things like that. And, and like, so, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s correctable. So we need to, we need to step away from that and we need to kind of start</p>
<p>heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit down the road. And that person may</p>
<p>respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great value with their approaches.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just probably polar ends of that, of the spectrum. And I think most people are probably</p>
<p>going to benefit like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones and those are going to work</p>
<p>right for the polarizing people. But then most people are going to fit somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably going to be able to kind of pull from both of those if they&rsquo;re able to sit</p>
<p>down and kind of like assess which one&rsquo;s going to work better in which situation. So the quitting</p>
<p>thing that you mentioned, the, like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker</p>
<p>than you seem to, which is like, why am I doing this? I get there with basically anything I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is, this is probably the stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done is the feeling I get often.</p>
<p>And then immediately you have these excuses that are like, there&rsquo;s all these other better things</p>
<p>you should be doing. Or, or the other alternative of that, like you said, I&rsquo;m not prepared enough</p>
<p>for this moment. I&rsquo;ll be much more prepared in two weeks for the next event. So like,</p>
<p>why let&rsquo;s try this again. Let&rsquo;s start over. Let&rsquo;s start over in two weeks.</p>
<p>How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you still go through that process and</p>
<p>and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me, how to deal with</p>
<p>that quitting voice? I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in,</p>
<p>it, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess,</p>
<p>in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you&rsquo;re looking at like,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing to you in the moment or how you&rsquo;re feeling in the moment versus how</p>
<p>are you feeling about the whole process? So one thing that I started doing in 2019, and I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily, I think, I think, I think this was a big reason why I had one of</p>
<p>my best racing seasons in 2019 that I&rsquo;d had to that date. It was part of it was I started, I</p>
<p>think, putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like,</p>
<p>this is one opportunity or one day of work. And this is one, one emotional kind of flare up.</p>
<p>But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I decide to do a race</p>
<p>or an event or something like that, it&rsquo;s often four, six months out ahead of time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day</p>
<p>and all that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to look at that and think that&rsquo;s an isolation. Like I&rsquo;m going to run 12 hours today,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to run a hundred miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it&rsquo;s a lot easier</p>
<p>to quit when you think to yourself, I&rsquo;m 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You know, that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most people, but in perspective, then we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the ultra marathon running community. You know, it&rsquo;s a lot easier just to say like, well,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll scrap this 40 miles and try again. It&rsquo;s a lot harder to say I&rsquo;m going to scrap the</p>
<p>entire last four months, the entire reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there.</p>
<p>So I think I just try to reposition it of like, I&rsquo;m in a bad place right now,</p>
<p>maybe in my head or I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m hitting a low point here, but I&rsquo;m 99% of the way towards the</p>
<p>goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did leading up to that.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important to ask yourself why, because, I mean, there are times when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing something and you ask yourself why, and you don&rsquo;t have a good reason. And then maybe it is</p>
<p>advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I actually want</p>
<p>to invest time and energy into? Because, you know, someone like yourself who is very much</p>
<p>into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very curious person. So there&rsquo;s like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doing what I&rsquo;m doing. And I know how to enjoy all of them. So at a certain point though,</p>
<p>you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer</p>
<p>keeps coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that</p>
<p>a hundred things that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I&rsquo;m in it for the right reason.</p>
<p>Then I just need to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out</p>
<p>of the hundred things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your</p>
<p>head so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here?</p>
<p>You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on</p>
<p>that before I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>early, middle or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you</p>
<p>had a little more of a level head. Well, there&rsquo;s something about the thing you mentioned when you</p>
<p>mentioned the death march. It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting. Like in the</p>
<p>moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process</p>
<p>and realize that it&rsquo;s not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life.</p>
<p>Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having that</p>
<p>escape clause from other things in your life. So I&rsquo;ve quit on a few things in my life. And</p>
<p>I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It&rsquo;s almost like a muscle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. So I think I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe everyone is, but I think I&rsquo;m kind of a quitter.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? Like I&rsquo;m really good at coming up with reasons to quit.</p>
<p>My mind is really good at that. And I, it feels like I have to come up with, like really work</p>
<p>hard to make sure that there&rsquo;s no quit. That I never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid</p>
<p>the thing I&rsquo;m doing is. I don&rsquo;t know if that any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to</p>
<p>rephrase this whole thing. Do you think it&rsquo;s good to live life by the ethos of never quit?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really interesting thing. And I think it actually resonates with a lot of</p>
<p>ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who&rsquo;s been in the</p>
<p>sport for a long time where there&rsquo;s a point where they start the sport, right? And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>super excited about everything. Everything&rsquo;s new. It&rsquo;s very easy not to quit because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>Oh, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever run a 50 case. The first time I ever run a 50 miles,</p>
<p>the first time I ever in a hundred case, first time I ever in a hundred miles and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing that for the first time, I think there&rsquo;s a heightened motivation to not quit</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want your first attempt to be a failure. And then you get a little further along</p>
<p>and you start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find</p>
<p>yourself quitting on an event. And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once,</p>
<p>now all of a sudden, like you, like you described perfectly that quit pops up in your head maybe a</p>
<p>little sooner than next time or maybe a little bit before. And I&rsquo;ve certainly had these experiences</p>
<p>in my career as well. And what happens, I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important</p>
<p>to assess whether you really want to be doing what you&rsquo;re doing. But if you start recognizing that</p>
<p>about yourself in a certain activity where it&rsquo;s like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on</p>
<p>some of this stuff. I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just at that point,</p>
<p>you need to make a decision. Do I want to keep doing this? If the answer is yes, you hold yourself</p>
<p>accountable to not quitting. And eventually what will happen is you&rsquo;ll find yourself in a position</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll use ultra marathons, for example, where you&rsquo;re just clicking on all cylinders for that day.</p>
<p>And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind. You have these low points,</p>
<p>but for whatever reason, when those low points are high, you&rsquo;re going to find yourself in a</p>
<p>reason when those low points come, you&rsquo;re able to push through them better than you would have in</p>
<p>the past. And then you push through maybe two or three more than you did after you had quit the</p>
<p>time before. Then it&rsquo;s accountability time, right? Because then you have to look back at that and say,</p>
<p>well, why did this time, was I able to be mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra</p>
<p>opportunities to quit when I wasn&rsquo;t before? And it can be easy to look back and say,</p>
<p>and live kind of retroactively in the sense where you&rsquo;re regretting, well, why did I drop out of</p>
<p>those races? Why did I do this wrong there? And I just think that&rsquo;s where you have to kind of</p>
<p>catch yourself and say, no, those things happened to me in order to put me in a position where I</p>
<p>decided, well, this time I&rsquo;m not going to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to quit. And then you put yourself in a position to have that day where you push through</p>
<p>more times than you ever have before. And you just redefine what you&rsquo;re capable of. And then once I</p>
<p>think you do that, you start looking at those earlier lessons as, as lessons, you know, were</p>
<p>they failures on paper at the time? Probably. But can you pull things from them to learn as to like,</p>
<p>well, where is your actual threshold? Where is the limit actually for you? And then kind of start</p>
<p>redefining that stuff. Um, so I think like the never quit mentality can be good in certain</p>
<p>situations, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily like a, like a holistic thing where you need to be in</p>
<p>something where it&rsquo;s never quit, always do more. Cause then you end up in a situation where you</p>
<p>find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes to training and workouts</p>
<p>and things like that, where there are times where often there are times where you want to actually</p>
<p>quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress that was required to elicit a, a growth</p>
<p>response has already occurred. And then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time</p>
<p>to get back and do it again. Yeah. This is the tricky trade off living by the never quit mentality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to achieve optimal performance in your head. You might.</p>
<p>It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history,</p>
<p>the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit. Like, uh, I feel like at</p>
<p>any one moment you&rsquo;re more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal. So like, um, in</p>
<p>terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice. Unless you deeply know</p>
<p>the person, maybe this is like wrestling mentality. I&rsquo;ve seen too many, and because I&rsquo;m annoyed with</p>
<p>the current culture telling me to relax and, and, uh, have a work life balance and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things, uh, which all have a deep, deep truth to them. But the reality is like, there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>people that walk up to me and like slap me and say, get your shit together. Like don&rsquo;t quit,</p>
<p>work harder. I think we need to hear that more. I, and like, I remember that, um, from the wrestling</p>
<p>rooms, like that when you&rsquo;re pushed that way, when you&rsquo;re forced to the very limit and you don&rsquo;t quit,</p>
<p>that makes better humans. I think people need to get that in their life. I think they need to have</p>
<p>situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience</p>
<p>that avenue, um, where I think it&rsquo;s maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life</p>
<p>philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit. But life is short, Zach. Like why? I</p>
<p>mean, this is the problem I have. This is probably the programming thing too is over optimization</p>
<p>is dangerous. Uh, it&rsquo;s like every once in a while, I mean, you&rsquo;re, you do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, for example, with a hundred mile run, you&rsquo;re, I mean, you could just be doing that for</p>
<p>the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run ever, but you keep taking on like</p>
<p>new challenges and there&rsquo;s a lot more chaos in that. And there it feels like the muscle of never</p>
<p>quit will be much more important than the optimality of your training. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about</p>
<p>the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something</p>
<p>long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call it, to put it. And for me, like one of my</p>
<p>my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra running is to first of all, find an event</p>
<p>that I really, really love to train for and participate in. So for me, I feel like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of identified that to a degree and that&rsquo;s kind of runnable hundred milers. So once I found</p>
<p>that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in</p>
<p>a very controlled environment? So let&rsquo;s eliminate weather, let&rsquo;s eliminate, you know, elevation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running a hundred miles. But for me, like</p>
<p>the important part of that is that I can control the environment enough where if I come back year</p>
<p>after year, I can retest myself and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed</p>
<p>or I stayed stagnant. And I think that&rsquo;s a big driver for me. But one thing I&rsquo;ve recognized</p>
<p>within that is if you just keep doing that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred</p>
<p>milers a year and optimally prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out.</p>
<p>But one thing I think I learned also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from</p>
<p>some of these really, really kind of important markers in your like your performance or in</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do and take a step away from it and try to do something a little different</p>
<p>in order to kind of hit the reset button on just like what I would call just like your mental</p>
<p>energy to be able to continue to do it at a high level. So almost like happiness. Exactly. Well,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the example. Like, I mean, I love running in trails to most people would consider me a flat</p>
<p>road track runner, runnable ultra runner. But I like to do trail runs too. So and at the end of</p>
<p>two thousand and eighteen, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to</p>
<p>run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, OK,</p>
<p>I did one. Now I&rsquo;m going to take a brief off season, but then I&rsquo;m going to ultimately build</p>
<p>up and peak for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind</p>
<p>of mimic like a long run, essentially. And but the main focus always in the back of my mind was</p>
<p>like getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles. And that just</p>
<p>kind of that energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to</p>
<p>keep that stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don&rsquo;t step away from</p>
<p>it for a little bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to prepare for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation,</p>
<p>technical trail type of an event. Is that a trail run or no? Yeah. It&rsquo;s a trail hundred miler</p>
<p>actually just kind of just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through it goes over part of</p>
<p>the Pacific Crest Trail and stuff. So it&rsquo;s very different than running on a runnable surface. So</p>
<p>to give you some context, like I ran was I think just under 17 hours for that race,</p>
<p>whereas on a flat surface I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone added</p>
<p>an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day. So it&rsquo;s just a different experience, different</p>
<p>skill set. And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like</p>
<p>splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat</p>
<p>environment and start training for something that&rsquo;s more climbing and descending, more technical</p>
<p>running skill sets and things like that. And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know,</p>
<p>when you step away from something and after something a lot different, I mean, it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>running. There&rsquo;s still a huge advantage I had from the running I&rsquo;d done in the past that was</p>
<p>going to put me in a good position to be successful. But there was a much higher or a much bigger range</p>
<p>of potential improvement for me. So through the like four plus months I spent preparing for that</p>
<p>race, you know, I noticed, oh wow, I&rsquo;m getting faster on this climb or I&rsquo;m getting better at</p>
<p>descending this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I&rsquo;ve run actually. So it was kind</p>
<p>of a cool experience. I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles. So you were racing, racing,</p>
<p>like you were trying to get first. So it&rsquo;s still a race. Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of</p>
<p>it? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve recognized it so much while I was doing it actually. It surfaced afterwards. I</p>
<p>mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting in basically second place all day long and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like</p>
<p>91 or 92 miles. It&rsquo;s like, yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of a cool way to race. But afterwards I recognized a</p>
<p>few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred</p>
<p>miler versus a second half. I also recognized shortly thereafter once I finished or covered</p>
<p>and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more</p>
<p>excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred</p>
<p>miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized</p>
<p>a suboptimal like outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I recognize that it was just every workout I did. I was like, I did this workout</p>
<p>a year ago and it was not nearly this much fun. And our, you know, the interesting thing about</p>
<p>these track hundreds too, is like you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do them on back to back days. And you know, I try to replicate the environment I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to race on. So I&rsquo;m finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it&rsquo;s like when I started doing</p>
<p>that again, I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those</p>
<p>back to back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again.</p>
<p>So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to the</p>
<p>race day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial</p>
<p>and kind of putting me in the right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day</p>
<p>and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood,</p>
<p>given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, even the thought of quitting. Yeah. Yeah. So you mentioned the track,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also ran 100 miles on the treadmill, and the trail 100 mile. Broadly, if we zoom out,</p>
<p>what does it take to run 100 miles? For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s interesting to ask, not only is just setting the world record, but</p>
<p>purely running, what does it take to run that far? Yeah, I mean, I think people probably</p>
<p>overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done. I think this is consistent in</p>
<p>just running in general. I think the marathon was always a big one with that where people thought</p>
<p>like, well, you have to do this training, or you just literally won&rsquo;t physically be able to complete</p>
<p>a marathon. And then we got into an era of kind of like, running as more of an enjoyment thing</p>
<p>versus a performance thing. And then you&rsquo;d have people running, granted much slower. I think if</p>
<p>you look at the Boston Marathon average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>Boston Marathon, it might have been marathons in general, went from like three hours to five hours</p>
<p>or something like that. So it&rsquo;s like, people, I think got past the fact that you can only do it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re optimally prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to like, not do much training, which I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily advise. But I mean, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to people who basically run 100 miles, sometimes almost off the couch. And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, to me, what that says is just the human body is incredible, and what it can tolerate</p>
<p>above and beyond what it&rsquo;s been exposed to, if it has to, or if it feels like it has to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the basic sort of getting from point A, from the start to the finish. It&rsquo;s the human body</p>
<p>and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation. But then you start to increase</p>
<p>the goal of performance, and you try to get actually a good, like, the most out of your body</p>
<p>that you can. How does that start to change then? Yeah, going from fun to performance? Yeah, I think</p>
<p>once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing, that&rsquo;s where it starts getting</p>
<p>interesting. Because now you could maybe go on with multiple goals where like, if one falls off</p>
<p>due to something that you didn&rsquo;t expect, then you have another one to target. But you can always</p>
<p>build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last time, or I want to, you</p>
<p>know, break a course record or an age group record or something like that. And that that I think is</p>
<p>just going to be a little bit of a different mindset. Because now you&rsquo;re looking at every</p>
<p>little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what I need to do to be efficient on</p>
<p>the day itself. So like transitioning aid stations and things like that, or do I want a pacer or not?</p>
<p>Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a certain spot? Or do I have to be in</p>
<p>specific areas to get that type of stuff? And it what ends up doing is it ends up bringing a lot</p>
<p>more variables to the table. And I think it&rsquo;s interesting, because there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>more variables on the day than you are able to account for. So at a certain degree, you have to</p>
<p>kind of find yourself in a position where I&rsquo;m going to make sure I take care of the big ones,</p>
<p>or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like, my fueling strategy, my hydration</p>
<p>strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position to physiologically</p>
<p>have this process go as well as possible? How am I going to like, you know, hold myself accountable</p>
<p>in aid station transition, so I&rsquo;m not like having a ton of non moving time versus moving time and</p>
<p>things like that. So there&rsquo;s these like, big variables that you&rsquo;re aware of, and you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to optimize over the space of variables. Yep. So you get to start to play with that. When you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for performance, it&rsquo;s almost like moving from checkers to chess, right? You have like, or</p>
<p>maybe even like connect for something like that, where it goes from just kind of like, well, one</p>
<p>foot in front of the other, and when I get to the next station, I&rsquo;ll just eat whatever looks good,</p>
<p>drink whatever, you know, quenches my thirst, and then move on to the next one to like, well,</p>
<p>which one of these food products is actually going to make me move a little faster to the next</p>
<p>aid station? Or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is going to get me to the</p>
<p>finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff. So it gets more complicated,</p>
<p>more interesting, and in my opinion, anyway, also, there&rsquo;s I mean, but there&rsquo;s a breaking point with</p>
<p>that too, because, like I said, there&rsquo;s an endless number of variables you could account for. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too. So you find yourself in this position</p>
<p>where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I&rsquo;ve accounted for everything I can reasonably</p>
<p>account for. Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that I wasn&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to account for, I&rsquo;m able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and not dwell on it.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s another thing. I mean, you&rsquo;re running slow enough when you&rsquo;re doing 100 miles,</p>
<p>where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake and say, why did I do</p>
<p>that? That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. When in reality, what you need to do is that</p>
<p>happened. Everyone else out here is gonna have a situation like that at some point. Mine happened</p>
<p>now. I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about</p>
<p>what happened back there. And that&rsquo;s where I think it gets really interesting. What would you say it</p>
<p>takes to set a world record in the 100 miler? First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that</p>
<p>specific event. I mean, there&rsquo;s the interesting thing about ultra running where it maybe deviates</p>
<p>a bit from just other endurance sports is there&rsquo;s such a wide range. I mean, we talked about a little</p>
<p>bit when I talked about the San Diego 100 versus kind of flat runnable stuff. So can you maybe</p>
<p>paint a picture of what are there&rsquo;s a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events?</p>
<p>What are like, the big ones in your mind? So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 50k, what are different kinds of there&rsquo;s 100 mile that in your mind, like kind of these</p>
<p>islands where, where people gather off? Yep. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s a few that really stand out. I would</p>
<p>say the three biggest ultra marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a</p>
<p>historical standpoint, but in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest, most competitive 100 miler. It&rsquo;s on the trail side of things in the United</p>
<p>States. Then there&rsquo;s ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the</p>
<p>planet right now. In previous years, it&rsquo;s been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail</p>
<p>Mount Blanc is more competitive. I think in the most recent few years, you&rsquo;re just seeing a lot</p>
<p>more like of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way.</p>
<p>And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon,</p>
<p>which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon,</p>
<p>is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon. The weird thing is the distance</p>
<p>thing, right? Cause most people in the think of endurance sports, they&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>precise distances, like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff. And then,</p>
<p>then you get into the ultra running world and it&rsquo;s like, sometimes it&rsquo;s the event. So like</p>
<p>the Western course itself is much more important than the distance, right? Yeah. So the Western</p>
<p>States 100 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn&rsquo;t that big of a deviation when you think about it,</p>
<p>especially when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a</p>
<p>hundred mile race. But the ultra trail Mount Blanc, you know, that&rsquo;s listed as a hundred</p>
<p>mile, but it&rsquo;s actually, I think like 104, 105 miles. So, you know, it&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>cultures too. So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close</p>
<p>to the exact distance. You&rsquo;re going to hear maybe a little more grumbling. If someone says,</p>
<p>I signed up for this hundred mile and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really care too much about the distance. They&rsquo;re more interested in like a</p>
<p>specific route or a loop. Is consistency important in terms of the exact length of the,</p>
<p>of the route? So like you can compare performances from previous years,</p>
<p>or are they a little bit more flexible? Like they redefine the trail from year to year.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely hard to compare. I mean, there&rsquo;s events that take, for example,</p>
<p>I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men&rsquo;s side is Jim Walmsley.</p>
<p>The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile</p>
<p>and not only the most versatile, but he&rsquo;s arguably the best at almost everything up to a hundred</p>
<p>miles. So there&rsquo;s a race called the Angela&rsquo;s crest hundred miler. They, the trail has drastically</p>
<p>changed from when they originally had that event and it&rsquo;s a different time of year. So it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>warmer on that course. And Jim&rsquo;s not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>chase that record. But I think Angela crest, when he looks at the segments and the pacing for that</p>
<p>one, he&rsquo;s like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore. So you have that, you have</p>
<p>some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like preserved, I guess you</p>
<p>would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side. I mean, comrades is going to be very</p>
<p>comparable from one year to the next because that&rsquo;s a road race. And that&rsquo;s where you get,</p>
<p>you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want that kind of like,</p>
<p>I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like someone who just says,</p>
<p>I want to be competitive today. And you know, maybe the weather is going to be 30 degrees</p>
<p>different from one year to the next on this course. But if I beat everyone on this day,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Montblanc or Western States,</p>
<ol start="100">
<li>And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter when</li>
</ol>
<p>or how the course was or what the time even was to some degree. When you were optimizing</p>
<p>for trying to set the world record in the hundred miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like</p>
<p>what were the variables you were looking at? Is it more in the realm of the actual race day,</p>
<p>the track, what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the,</p>
<p>to the race? I mean, it evolved a bit. Like, I think the, as I learned more about just like,</p>
<p>what is required to kind of really do that stuff. So there&rsquo;s some variables you can control for,</p>
<p>you know, I try to control for as many as I can. The big one that kind of stands out that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily control for is it&rsquo;s pretty rare where you get an event where they&rsquo;re just doing a hundred</p>
<p>miles on a track. It&rsquo;s usually like a, like an event of like a series of different events where</p>
<p>they might be like some people out there doing 50 K, some people out there doing 24 or something</p>
<p>like the event I did at, there was six day folks out there. They&rsquo;re trying to see how far they</p>
<p>could get in six days. So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the</p>
<p>distance. So, you know, track protocol is always like you pass on the outside. So if you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>one of the faster paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you&rsquo;re going to, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a hundred miles, you&rsquo;re probably going to be running faster than most people out there.</p>
<p>Then, you know, you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around</p>
<p>the turns and then sometimes lane three around the turns. So it&rsquo;s down to those little details</p>
<p>that have a big impact. Yep. So I had to build that into my pacing strategy. I also have to build</p>
<p>into the pacing strategy, like relative nonmoving time. You know, I did a race just recently,</p>
<p>it was the US track and field hundred mile road championships. And I did not stop once other than</p>
<p>like, I guess I technically stopped like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab</p>
<p>bottles and get myself wet. Cause it was like 94 degrees that day, but I didn&rsquo;t like stop at all</p>
<p>during that race from like what I would say is like a long period of time where we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>up to like a minute, but that&rsquo;s pretty rare. Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19</p>
<p>minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for</p>
<p>sure, but I think it was like three to four minutes or something like that. So you got to,</p>
<p>you got to figure that into your pacing strategy, especially if you&rsquo;re chasing a specific time.</p>
<p>Cause you know, if I&rsquo;m pacing for, you know, at the time the world record was 1128. So if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pacing for say 1127, 30 or something like that, and I don&rsquo;t account for that three minutes of</p>
<p>stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I&rsquo;m a minute off of the world</p>
<p>record. So 1128, we&rsquo;re talking about 11 hours, we&rsquo;re talking about a hundred miles. Can you</p>
<p>mention what the world record was? What kind of world record you set? Can you tell your own story</p>
<p>here of what you were able to accomplish that world record that I broke actually just recently</p>
<p>got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race. I mean, he&rsquo;s won the 24</p>
<p>hour world championships. He&rsquo;s won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultra marathon</p>
<p>rates, 153 miles. So it&rsquo;s getting a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>traditionally done. He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57. So his pace was 645 per mile. Mine was</p>
<p>647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy. I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just really cool</p>
<p>because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted. I think</p>
<p>there was, as I kind of moved through, cause I mean, it took me almost six years from the day</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it. And through that five to six</p>
<p>years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to</p>
<p>my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing? And then ultimately what needs to be done</p>
<p>for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles. Cause I think that&rsquo;s going to be, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen soon. I think it&rsquo;s going to happen in the next few years. What pace would that be?</p>
<p>Sub 11 would be, I think like, I think it&rsquo;s like 635 right about per mile. You&rsquo;re moving quick,</p>
<p>but not so quick that like you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you know, void of being able to think about everything</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s happening. So what&rsquo;s the pace in terms of, if you look for each of the one mile segments for</p>
<p>the hundred miles, is it pretty steady six, like in order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty</p>
<p>steady 635? Does it go up and down? Do you speed up at the very end? Like what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the pacing?</p>
<p>If you were to maybe how much variability is there in the pacing for an optimal performance here?</p>
<p>Yeah. So if you&rsquo;re talking about someone, let&rsquo;s say that there was someone, well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take me for example, let&rsquo;s say that we could just like, we had this infinite knowledge</p>
<p>and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce a 10 59, but I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 10 59. Uh, I would definitely</p>
<p>want to either have a slight negative or slight positive split. So when, um, and I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half</p>
<p>and the second half isn&rsquo;t going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower</p>
<p>the first half and a little bit faster. The second half isn&rsquo;t going to drastically change your outcome.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re referring to. The split is you&rsquo;re looking at the first 50 miles and</p>
<p>the second 50 miles. And you can break it down as tiny as you want. Like I think, uh,</p>
<p>when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that</p>
<p>like three to four minute nonmoving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight.</p>
<p>Um, I had a couple that were, um, it was weird cause that, that track that I did that on was</p>
<p>actually like 400 and some weird number, like 400 and like 38 meters or something like that. So I</p>
<p>actually like ran like my numbers based on that. So they&rsquo;re there normally I&rsquo;m dealing with 400</p>
<p>meters and then it&rsquo;s a little more like clean as to like what my lap splits are going to range from</p>
<p>one event to the next. So we&rsquo;re talking about running a hundred miles on a track. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so that you can be really scientific about getting the, the, this, the, um, the pacing,</p>
<p>right. And, uh, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to</p>
<p>this? Like, are you alternating directions? Yeah. They&rsquo;ll switch directions at most events every</p>
<p>four hours. So you&rsquo;ll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out. And once it hits</p>
<p>like, like, let&rsquo;s say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you&rsquo;re on and then you do a loop</p>
<p>around and then you start the next, your next lap. Would you say you take the exact same number of</p>
<p>steps? Like when you&rsquo;re really in the groove, when you take in the pacing, are we talking about that</p>
<p>level of precision or is it a little bit more feel? You mean like foot strike frequency? Yeah.</p>
<p>Like frequency then over the distance to the lap. Would you say it&rsquo;s so precise that you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you get in this groove where it&rsquo;s like, gosh, you&rsquo;re making me wish I would have strapped more</p>
<p>like a foot pod to my head. But like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it&rsquo;s pretty precise.</p>
<p>Like is there a video of this? Sorry. I keep interrupting. Is there a video of this? Cause</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;ve actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts</p>
<p>foot strikes. Oh, really? Yeah. For fun. Yeah. I was trying to understand, uh, we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>this later. We have the same definition of fun when I got my, find myself on a track for all day</p>
<p>and you find yourself counting foot strikes. I was trying to understand if, if there&rsquo;s how much</p>
<p>variability there&rsquo;s in a extreme, like elite performers within a particular race, but also</p>
<p>across races. It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability</p>
<p>there is in the human body and in the way they use legs to move quickly. I think my guess would be</p>
<p>that at the individual level, it&rsquo;s going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing</p>
<p>is consistent. So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles</p>
<p>than I did the first 50 miles. So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran some of</p>
<p>my fastest miles at the end. Uh, so there&rsquo;s going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest</p>
<p>miles to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike. Uh, but probably not by a huge</p>
<p>margin, but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone</p>
<p>whose gate is just a little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down</p>
<p>on the outside of my foot and I&rsquo;m kind of more of a mid forefoot striker. So that&rsquo;s going to kind of</p>
<p>impact my cadence to a degree. Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their</p>
<p>foot or heel striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in. Uh, so that person</p>
<p>may have a little bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone, and I think you see this</p>
<p>in elite marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, uh,</p>
<p>much, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this.</p>
<p>And I think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn&rsquo;t say drastic, but,</p>
<p>you know, to the degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from</p>
<p>one person to the next. But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is</p>
<p>going to be. The slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be, but there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>probably a range of optimal lowness and I don&rsquo;t know, probably optimal highness too than that.</p>
<p>If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the</p>
<p>person that breaks 11 hours? And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would,</p>
<p>what would it take? And third question is, is it even possible in your intuition?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I would def I would be lying to you if I said I didn&rsquo;t want to be the first person</p>
<p>to break 11 hours and a hundred miles. I think that&rsquo;ll be, um, would be a cool like barrier to</p>
<p>be the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I&rsquo;m much more motivated in seeing it done</p>
<p>from the sense that like, I think when we&rsquo;re talking about records, it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>is inevitable that it&rsquo;s going to get broken. So, I mean, we were talking about happiness before</p>
<p>this, right? So I&rsquo;ve contemplated this in the past, um, where I was thinking to myself, like,</p>
<p>uh, if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record</p>
<p>and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do</p>
<p>an assessment of what I&rsquo;m kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at.</p>
<p>Uh, and just reflect on how I&rsquo;m behaving in life because it&rsquo;s going to get broken, right? I mean,</p>
<p>I could run 10 50 tomorrow and in 10 years, chances are that&rsquo;s no longer going to be my</p>
<p>world record anymore. Someone&rsquo;s going to run faster than that. So if you&rsquo;re living to hold</p>
<p>on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world</p>
<p>record, you&rsquo;re moving the sport forward, then, then you have to look at that as like, that was</p>
<p>my contribution. And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point. What you want</p>
<p>is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited,</p>
<p>motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast</p>
<p>can someone run a controlled environment, a hundred miler. And that&rsquo;s what I really want to</p>
<p>see. Uh, cause I think I&rsquo;ve gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I mean, I&rsquo;ve gotten so much</p>
<p>enjoyment from the sport. I&rsquo;ve been able to turn it into a career. And I think there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people who can do the same thing and it&rsquo;s not necessarily going to come at the expense of</p>
<p>my career. Uh, but it&rsquo;s going to bring more attention to the sport. It&rsquo;s going to bring more</p>
<p>interest in the sport. It&rsquo;s going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have</p>
<p>never thought about it, seen it, considered it. And to me, I think that&rsquo;s like a much more rewarding</p>
<p>goal than saying I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die</p>
<p>with this record. So I never have to see someone go faster than me. Well, that&rsquo;s the progress of</p>
<p>human civilization was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff. Well,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the other thing is just like, if you&rsquo;re honest with yourself too, it&rsquo;s, uh, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing this right now in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new</p>
<p>technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in. And then we see like the new crop of</p>
<p>folks have advantages that the old crop didn&rsquo;t have. And it can be easy to look back on that and</p>
<p>say like, Hey, well, um, you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that,</p>
<p>I would have run this. But then you&rsquo;re getting into that negative, you know, thought process again,</p>
<p>which I generally try to stay off of. It&rsquo;s like the caveman. If I had fire, I would have done</p>
<p>right. But with this, look at these idiots up there with their cars. If I would have had a car</p>
<p>back then, I would have been ruled the world. Um, let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about</p>
<p>kind of beauty and love. What&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing about running to you? Why do you love it?</p>
<p>I think, uh, there&rsquo;s kind of a couple of directions to look at it through our lenses,</p>
<p>look at it through. There&rsquo;s like the, in the moment, right? There&rsquo;s always going to be that</p>
<p>run where, uh, you&rsquo;re clicking along and things just feel great. You get some endorphins and you</p>
<p>get the, the, you know, the, the quote unquote runner&rsquo;s high and that sort of stuff. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like just like this great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real, like,</p>
<p>like in the moment type of level. Uh, you know, you&rsquo;ve, my wife and I talk about this because</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a competitive ultra runner as well. And, um, you will, you&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll have a day where,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ll take a forced day off or something like that. And it&rsquo;s necessary, right? It&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>allow the enjoyment to continue. But you get into this like routine of, I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>I do this run and that kind of gets my day started. That gets my energies up. I get that</p>
<p>runner&rsquo;s high afterwards. You remove that from the equation for a rest day. And you just start</p>
<p>like, oh man, I don&rsquo;t feel like I never got started today. Like, you know, it&rsquo;s just this</p>
<p>weird thing. It&rsquo;s almost, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny because non runners don&rsquo;t always like</p>
<p>necessarily recognize it because for them it&rsquo;s the complete opposite. They&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>if I can get away from not having to run today, that&rsquo;s going to be a good day versus. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it. So, uh, so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>purely from the running perspective. There&rsquo;s this joy of, uh, of the runner&rsquo;s high of the post after</p>
<p>the run. You feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing. Yes. And I think that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the drivers from just the quality of life standpoint. Uh, just, uh, you know, and in the</p>
<p>moment, immediate gratification, uh, standpoint. But then there&rsquo;s like, I think the bigger picture</p>
<p>stuff or the longer term stuff. And for me, that enjoyment is like just the process like of, uh,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m starting at this fitness level and I&rsquo;m going to do these workouts and by doing these</p>
<p>workouts, I&rsquo;m going to see incremental progress from them. And then that&rsquo;s another kind of like,</p>
<p>kind of short term gratification. That&rsquo;s maybe a little longer than the day to day, but,</p>
<p>um, still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I&rsquo;m focusing on short intervals right</p>
<p>now. And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four, I&rsquo;m covering</p>
<p>this much distance and you can just see that progress is almost like, uh, in elementary</p>
<p>school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it&rsquo;s like, did that gold star really mean</p>
<p>anything? I don&rsquo;t know, but I felt great when they gave it to me. There&rsquo;s something about just</p>
<p>finding improvement and people love to see improvement, I think. So that&rsquo;s where, uh,</p>
<p>I think you can also get some value in it saying like I started here and I got there.</p>
<p>Um, and then I think there&rsquo;s also just like, uh, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top,</p>
<p>which is like where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that&rsquo;s going to be kind</p>
<p>of the thing that kind of like, uh, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies</p>
<p>whether you did things right or wrong. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s a sense which, in which training is a kind</p>
<p>of, uh, preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist.</p>
<p>You get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck, it might be beautiful. Uh, I mean,</p>
<p>I, I, I see in the grappling world, I see competition in that same way when I feel the best</p>
<p>about it, which is like, sounds pretentious to say, but like, I&rsquo;m trying to be the best version of</p>
<p>myself in this particular day of competition and to do something that I&rsquo;ll be proud of in, in, uh,</p>
<p>in an artist way, not in a kind of some kind of numerical way, but like as a holistic sense, like</p>
<p>do something cool. Like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling,</p>
<p>like taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the, in the context of grappling</p>
<p>and, and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play,</p>
<p>play beautifully. I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there&rsquo;s systematic chess players and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius where they take the big risk</p>
<p>that eventually pays off or doesn&rsquo;t. And that to me is art that, I mean, there&rsquo;s art within running,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s art within chess, there&rsquo;s art within grappling. And you got a chance, like all the</p>
<p>training is more like science. And then it feels like the competition days art. Yeah. I think that</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a really cool, cool way to look at. And I think it&rsquo;s when you really open up the</p>
<p>perspective of that too, it&rsquo;s like even, uh, obviously, you know, having a great day,</p>
<p>like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than you were expected to,</p>
<p>or beating someone who you&rsquo;ve never beaten before or something like that. Uh, or in the running</p>
<p>perspective, like achieving that goal time, uh, that sort of stuff. Obviously those are kind of</p>
<p>like the ones you, if, when you&rsquo;re honest with yourself, you really want, and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>probably get the most satisfaction out of, but even when they don&rsquo;t go wrong, like maybe like</p>
<p>with your grappling tournament, uh, analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you&rsquo;re grappling against</p>
<p>does a move on you and you&rsquo;re like, I was not prepared for that move. So now the enjoyment</p>
<p>becomes, okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens</p>
<p>to me next time. And that&rsquo;s where the, I think the why comes in again, same thing with running.</p>
<p>Like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn&rsquo;t really want to eat or,</p>
<p>or thought was going to work, but didn&rsquo;t work. And it costs me more time than I gained by having it</p>
<p>or something like that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that. That didn&rsquo;t work. Or if I&rsquo;m going to do that, I need to be more prepared to</p>
<p>be able to do it. And I love that part of the sport. Um, just the rearranging of things and</p>
<p>adjusting and tinkering. There&rsquo;s some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us</p>
<p>meaning. Cause like if, if everything, um, if you weren&rsquo;t able to find mistakes and something you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done, it feels like the life would be void of meaning. It&rsquo;s a lost opportunity too. Like if,</p>
<p>I mean, like when I look at even my a hundred mile race of 11, 19, I can find spots in there</p>
<p>where I was like, Oh, you know what? I could clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do this</p>
<p>differently. And I mean, that&rsquo;s going to get me, you know, a little bit faster. If I sat back and</p>
<p>said, Hey, well things went great that day. Cool. Let&rsquo;s see if we can replicate it. Then, you know,</p>
<p>I probably run 11, 19 again. So can we talk about training a little bit? What does your training</p>
<p>look like year round day to day, hour to hour, like optimal? Maybe, uh, maybe you want to pick a</p>
<p>race in the context of what you want to discuss that, but, and also people should follow you on</p>
<p>Instagram. You have a lot of kind of interesting, um, like little glances into your training process</p>
<p>and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating. But if you look at an optimal training</p>
<p>process, what does that look like? Yeah. So I think, uh, the, if we were looking at it from</p>
<p>like a philosophical level or like an approach level, I think there&rsquo;s some things that carry over</p>
<p>from regardless of the distance. So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least</p>
<p>specific to what you&rsquo;re going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in</p>
<p>terms of improving your ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential, uh,</p>
<p>with the things that are specific you do first. I say that, but there&rsquo;s a caveat with endurance</p>
<p>sport. I think maybe even more specifically with things like our ultra marathons or a hundred</p>
<p>miles where you want a really strong aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start,</p>
<p>I think, structuring things towards a specific one. So for me, I think like a target for me is</p>
<p>oftentimes like, uh, you know, getting really fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic</p>
<p>threshold or what a lot of people may be called like a maximum aerobic function. Um, I mean,</p>
<p>the running world is kind of weird where we have like these terminologies where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from like, uh,</p>
<p>just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like a feeling and stuff like that. So</p>
<p>you mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state. Like how important is it just</p>
<p>to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace that would depend on the event.</p>
<p>I would say to a degree and there&rsquo;s contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it. I</p>
<p>think a lot of times like, uh, you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m running easy, whatever feels easy that day. And that can be different from one day to</p>
<p>the next. Like I might feel great and you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I feel</p>
<p>really miserable or something like that. Um, so that&rsquo;s why I think a lot of times running,</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll do the whole perceived, perceived effort or perceived exertion.</p>
<p>And there you&rsquo;re looking at kind of understanding the response your body has to a certain effort</p>
<p>level and you&rsquo;re supposed to target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain</p>
<p>response. So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like I think I focus</p>
<p>on essentially like short intervals. I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs. Uh, I focus on,</p>
<p>um, like race pace intensity, which is a lot of times what I&rsquo;ll build my long run around. Um,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll also like, those are kind of like the small pieces to the puzzle. Those are the options</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working with. Yeah, but I&rsquo;m going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive</p>
<p>aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work. So how do you build that massive</p>
<p>aerobic base? What are we talking about? Just distance? Distance and essentially, so I like</p>
<p>to call it microstressing because you&rsquo;re going to always start at a different spot depending</p>
<p>on where your fitness level is at and depending on where you&rsquo;re at as an individual. I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to be targeting my aerobic threshold. I&rsquo;m going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross</p>
<p>over it. Um, it&rsquo;s, it, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind</p>
<p>of a training philosophy. That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more like</p>
<p>holistic where they&rsquo;re saying, do this basically all the time. And by doing so, you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re going to raise your aerobic potential by so much that, you know, you can kind of like</p>
<p>race yourself into shape at that point. And this would be maybe more specific for like shorter</p>
<p>distance or endurance runs where you&rsquo;re not going to really race yourself in the shape of a hundred</p>
<p>milers. But for five Ks, you might, you might do like a huge base building phase where you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you&rsquo;re watching your pace come down</p>
<p>at that. So the rule there is basically like if you&rsquo;re seeing improvement, that&rsquo;s the sign</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for, or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or at that</p>
<p>intensity. And, uh, if you&rsquo;re seeing that continually go down, you&rsquo;re heading in the</p>
<p>right direction. If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re probably overreaching</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to do too much of it. So that&rsquo;s kind of dictates how much the dose,</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;d say, when we talk about max aerobic function, we&rsquo;re talking about heart rate as the</p>
<p>ultimate, as the really important metric here. So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run.</p>
<p>Uh, is that the measure that, like, how do you know you&rsquo;re in the right place? Yeah. Yeah. And</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s where it gets a little tricky because like, unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic</p>
<p>threshold tested, it&rsquo;s really hard to have like an exact number on it. Um, you know, Dr. Phil</p>
<p>Maffetone with the maximum function process, he&rsquo;ll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s the MAF 180 formula that I thought was fascinating for, it&rsquo;s like, uh, in the same</p>
<p>way E equals E equals MC squared is fascinating that there could be a formula that captures like</p>
<p>optimal running. So that for people who don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s 180 minus your age, if you train at that</p>
<p>heart rate, if you run at that heart rate, you&rsquo;re going to progress a lot. And here&rsquo;s the advantage</p>
<p>of that. I think like with any of these things, you want to look at it through where are the</p>
<p>advantages here and I need to account for those. And then where are the potential disadvantages</p>
<p>and then decide for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s the alternative approach and is that going to produce more advantages or less?</p>
<p>So with, with maximum function, uh, here&rsquo;s some advantages. Like it is low enough intensity</p>
<p>where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk</p>
<p>with a very low, like things that are going to maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle</p>
<p>damage and things like that. Um, it&rsquo;s a more efficient way in the sense that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be like prioritizing like fat metabolization, which, um, I mean, if you&rsquo;re looking at like</p>
<p>Jeff Follick and Dr. Jeff Follick and Dr. Dominic DiAgostino, some of their research and things like</p>
<p>that, like they&rsquo;re going to show that, you know, that&rsquo;s going to be a little cleaner way to go</p>
<p>about things from just a recovery standpoint, a breakdown standpoint. So they could be like a,</p>
<p>what they call like a fat adapted athlete. So you can go to your fat stores for energy if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>applying this math. What is it called by the way? Math 180. Is that a good, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about in general for yourself and for the broader population? I think the math 180 formula is about</p>
<p>as good of a formula as you&rsquo;re going to find in terms of capturing as many people as you can get</p>
<p>away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing. Uh, like any of these things, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus their age</p>
<p>is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out where that is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to do. If I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running along and I&rsquo;m just like, my, my breathing is labored. I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m struggling</p>
<p>to get a sentence out without gasping for breath. Well, that&rsquo;s my body telling me I&rsquo;m probably not</p>
<p>actually at my true like math number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic threshold, like</p>
<p>aerobic threshold and maximum function, you should be able to do that for hours and you should be</p>
<p>able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk. Yep. Carry a conversation. Um, other people will say,</p>
<p>like you, another way to kind of gauge it, if you can breathe in your nose and out your mouth,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily the best way to do on a, from a performance standpoint, but it can be a</p>
<p>good kind of governor that will allow you to, like, if you can, if you can no longer breathe</p>
<p>in your nose and out your mouth, you&rsquo;re probably going too fast to actually technically be at your</p>
<p>math pace or under your math pace. Yeah. I had, uh, actually when I was in, in better shape,</p>
<p>I had trouble getting to that math number. I found myself like that I would be doing way too much</p>
<p>work. Like it was too hard to do. It was too hard to get to that number. I was running a much lower</p>
<p>heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower. And that&rsquo;s, I was still for myself,</p>
<p>happy with the pace. It was a good pace and, and I was, felt good. I was smiling and enjoying life</p>
<p>and, uh, I did. And the moment I take myself to that, uh, level of like the, the math 180 level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that felt like a real workout. Yeah. And it felt like I can&rsquo;t do that for five, 10,</p>
<p>15 miles. Like I, I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing.</p>
<p>No, but I think his answer to that, uh, Phil Meftone&rsquo;s answer is maybe you&rsquo;re supposed to like,</p>
<p>uh, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your, maybe like I&rsquo;m too</p>
<p>weak. Yeah. Musculature wise to like, uh, yeah, like that, that&rsquo;s a sign that you need to work</p>
<p>on some stuff. You can&rsquo;t just keep enjoying life. There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s two ways to look at that,</p>
<p>I think. And I think you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re right on. I think that what the advice from that, from</p>
<p>that kind of a process would say is either you, you&rsquo;re doing too much of it. So it&rsquo;s getting too</p>
<p>hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at for that particular activity. So</p>
<p>like, it can be different too. Like if you&rsquo;re cycling versus running, you know, that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit of different mechanic where it can be different where you could take a super fit cyclist and then</p>
<p>put them on, you know, the, the volume, the volume they&rsquo;re going to be able to tolerate relative to</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to do when you remove like impact forces and things like that is going to be</p>
<p>lower if they haven&rsquo;t been practicing that activity. So for you, like, you know, you&rsquo;re prioritizing,</p>
<p>like, uh, uh, wrestling and mixed martial arts or not mixed martial arts, but jujitsu type stuff. So,</p>
<p>uh, you know, running is maybe kind of that, that, uh, that secondary activity versus the primary</p>
<p>activity. But yeah, so what they would say is probably like, maybe instead of doing that at,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting</p>
<p>too hard to continue there, they&rsquo;d say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable</p>
<p>with 20, then let&rsquo;s get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along.</p>
<p>One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not</p>
<p>great. Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right. Maybe I was doing too</p>
<p>big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of, um, the</p>
<p>form of your form, the economy, the efficiency. Yeah. So that was, that was the intuition. Like</p>
<p>I was doing something wrong, but I suppose that&rsquo;s the benefit of these kind of formulas. It</p>
<p>challenges you to think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff? Well, and it also, it simplifies</p>
<p>it so much that you&rsquo;re forced to, right? You&rsquo;re forced to optimize within that real strict</p>
<p>parameter versus am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong? Or am I doing my</p>
<p>like long intervals right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things</p>
<p>when you start throwing a lot of stuff there. And for most people, especially when they&rsquo;re first</p>
<p>getting started, you know, you&rsquo;re, you can&rsquo;t overcomplicate it or you&rsquo;re just going to like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things and then not really know where</p>
<p>your progress or your deficits are necessarily at. So I do think this is an amazing approach,</p>
<p>especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation, um, where,</p>
<p>where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you start getting</p>
<p>to these events that are operating well outside that intensity. So you take something like, um,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or</p>
<p>something like that, then you&rsquo;re going to be running significantly faster than your, your</p>
<p>maximum function pace. So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need to</p>
<p>get around to practicing the pace at which you&rsquo;re going to perform at and really fine tuning the</p>
<p>mechanics, uh, the efficiencies, uh, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to try to compete at. So there&rsquo;s obviously like a large range of targets there when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events,</p>
<p>like five kilometers, and then you also have a hundred mile races, which are going to typically</p>
<p>be quite a bit below your maximum heroic function in, especially on these trail races.</p>
<p>I need to admit something. So I don&rsquo;t measure the runs at all in terms of, uh, time, uh,</p>
<p>because I get competitive with myself. So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this</p>
<p>thing where I just go by feel. Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have</p>
<p>running as part of your life and be a good performer in running? I actually think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you want to get to. The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll go out and they&rsquo;ll run with a friend and match their pace. Or they&rsquo;ll go out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, well, I want to run this pace. So they&rsquo;ll target that pace or target a specific</p>
<p>heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it. So I think</p>
<p>like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is</p>
<p>performance, it&rsquo;s a little harder to just say like, well, I&rsquo;m going to run whatever feels good today</p>
<p>because eventually you have to get around to doing what&rsquo;s specific. But from just a fitness</p>
<p>standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, um, I think it&rsquo;s totally fine to go out and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to run what feels good today. And you know, maybe someday you will feel like at</p>
<p>the end of the run, I&rsquo;m going to do a couple of sprints just to get some, you know, that,</p>
<p>because it does, that one&rsquo;s a hard one to kind of jumpstart, but once you do it and you realize how</p>
<p>kind of good it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run. And then you,</p>
<p>you say, oh wow, that feels pretty good to do that. I feel a little more accomplished.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s a forcing function, but I like to finish runs with sprints anyway.</p>
<p>Okay. Because you&rsquo;re already there without, right. You don&rsquo;t need to the timing. I&rsquo;m afraid</p>
<p>of the time becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it&rsquo;s a useful tool to get you to learn</p>
<p>the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have to be in good shape.</p>
<p>And then you can throw out the time. Well, I think too with, with feel running. And what</p>
<p>I mean by that is that kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough</p>
<p>of it and you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run,</p>
<p>you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my</p>
<p>heart rate. And I could go out there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go</p>
<p>out and run that feel. And I&rsquo;m going to hit that spot. Like I bet you if we looked at my heart</p>
<p>rate data after that, it&rsquo;d be right in there. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have to look at some of that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just experience. Someone&rsquo;s just understanding like when like noticing the physiological responses,</p>
<p>when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it, uh, you can get yourself daydreaming</p>
<p>and forget. I&rsquo;ll do this sometimes too, where I&rsquo;ll be tart. Cause I&rsquo;m kind of like you too,</p>
<p>where when I&rsquo;m getting really fit, uh, especially with my foundation, like I gotta, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold. So like if I start daydreaming too much, I can</p>
<p>notice, Oh, I&rsquo;m drifting back a little bit. I looked down at my heart rate matter. Oh yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 10 beats under, you know, so you do it. It does take a little bit of, I think just awareness.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you&rsquo;re hitting things,</p>
<p>you know, an exact heart rate all the time. There&rsquo;s usually a range and there&rsquo;s even like</p>
<p>some fluctuations where like if you&rsquo;ve been healthy for a year or two without any injuries</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been fit that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using that as kind of your, your target from the 180 minus your age formula.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you, you offer readymade plans</p>
<p>for people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance.</p>
<p>Maybe you can elaborate, but what does that plan look like? Usually what are the key</p>
<p>options as you&rsquo;ve already kind of mentioned? And how does your week look like? How do a lot of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s week look like in terms of splits? Are we talking about, um, you know, in terms of rest</p>
<p>days, in terms of how often do you do speed work versus longer distance? You mentioned long runs.</p>
<p>Like, is there something you could say that&rsquo;s generally applicable about the, the structure</p>
<p>of these plans? The readymade plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, um, and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be like kind of like lockstep in that. Um, so for those, like there&rsquo;s always going to be a sacrifice</p>
<p>when you do like a readymade plan because there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re removing the individual context there.</p>
<p>So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized</p>
<p>coaching plan with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses</p>
<p>and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it. And it also like it avoids</p>
<p>it avoids a situation where, Oh, my readymade plan says I&rsquo;m supposed to do this run today,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel great today. So what do I do? I mean, some people are fine with that because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves.</p>
<p>Other folks just need a little more support. So, um, that&rsquo;s kind of the difference there,</p>
<p>but in terms of the structure of it, it kind of goes with an approach where</p>
<p>ogre saying you build this foundation, you&rsquo;re going to spend, you know, usually anywhere</p>
<p>between eight to 12 weeks just building up your, your aerobic foundation. You&rsquo;re going to be doing</p>
<p>a lot of stuff that are kind of at, I call them base runs, but they&rsquo;re basically your maximum</p>
<p>aerobic function or you&rsquo;re up to your aerobic threshold type stuff. And they&rsquo;re really going</p>
<p>to get really fit with that. And once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it&rsquo;s time to</p>
<p>get into the specifics of whatever distance they&rsquo;re doing. So if it, where it will differ will</p>
<p>be like if they&rsquo;re doing a right now on those plans, I think I&rsquo;ve got 5k half marathon marathon,</p>
<p>50k, 80 to a hundred K and then a hundred miles. So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations</p>
<p>is going to be different than if they pick the a hundred mile plan, you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>some of the same workouts show up in that plan. It just going to be different areas of it. So once</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really fit at that, uh, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing say a hundred mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would, on my</p>
<p>plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It&rsquo;s kind of that short interval</p>
<p>range. Can you describe what you mean by short interval? It&rsquo;s like a sprint and then a rest.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ll use basically like, I&rsquo;ll use like a, basically a 12 minute time trial</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be</p>
<p>for some of those. When they&rsquo;re under a minute, they&rsquo;ll push past that a little bit. Um, but</p>
<p>usually when we&rsquo;re up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes, like whatever pace</p>
<p>or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial, where they&rsquo;re just seeing how</p>
<p>far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be, um, kind of like about where they&rsquo;re going to target</p>
<p>for those intervals. So then those intervals are going to be structured. Let&rsquo;s say we were doing</p>
<p>two minute intervals. They&rsquo;re going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for</p>
<p>12 minutes at a time trial. Then they&rsquo;re going to do a two minute real easy jog, or maybe even walk</p>
<p>just to kind of bounce back. And they&rsquo;re going to repeat it. How do you figure out how far you can</p>
<p>go in 12 minutes? Is that just a trial and error you build up to it? There&rsquo;s formulas with,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s some newer formulas that are probably a little less, uh, um, brutal, uh,</p>
<p>where you kind of, uh, I haven&rsquo;t really dove into these that that in depth yet. I know like, um,</p>
<p>that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly</p>
<p>longer one. Um, and then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of</p>
<p>indicate what it is. Uh, and so you&rsquo;re doing less of it to get the same answer to the question.</p>
<p>But sometimes I think when it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s new, I&rsquo;d rather them just do a 12 minute time trial</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy for them to execute in the sense that it&rsquo;s pretty clear. You do a warm up,</p>
<p>you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes</p>
<p>as evenly paced as you can manage. And, uh, I mean, if the, if it&rsquo;s going to produce the data</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for, uh, and I mean, it&rsquo;s also no matter what happens, they&rsquo;ll produce the data.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you can, you can screw it up. I guess you can go way too fast. Then you have this</p>
<p>scenario where like, Oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically</p>
<p>faster than your last two. And then it&rsquo;s like, Oh, we maybe screwed that one up. But, um,</p>
<p>but I mean really like you don&rsquo;t even need to do the time trial technically. Um, a lot of times</p>
<p>you can go off of feel like what we described with, um, the threshold stuff and, and, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a high enough intensity where, where like you can start to kind of like your, your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to kind of limit you to a degree where, um, if I said we didn&rsquo;t do the time trial and just</p>
<p>started doing the intervals, we could figure out that, you know, if they&rsquo;re doing them right or</p>
<p>not, if we see a scenario where, Oh, it looks like these first two intervals were significantly</p>
<p>slower than the last two chances are, we&rsquo;re still not quite dialed in in terms of what the intensity</p>
<p>is that you should be targeting for those. And as you do a few of them, you just get to know</p>
<p>the pacing of it a little better. And then you start seeing more even split. So like, you know,</p>
<p>their first two minute intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or,</p>
<p>you know, I guess we&rsquo;d be looking at distance if we&rsquo;re doing time. So like you went approximately</p>
<p>the same distance on that last one as you did the first one. And then we&rsquo;re just looking for</p>
<p>improvement over time. So, you know, we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to still include kind of foundational running volume where you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable pace kind of in the interim. And then there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be some rest days and that&rsquo;s going to be where the levels come in. My like level one plans are</p>
<p>going to be like four day a week training plans. Level two are going to be five day level three</p>
<p>are going to be six day with one day off. Um, and you can obviously operate outside of those,</p>
<p>those, those are just the ones that I put up for the readymade when I&rsquo;m coaching people kind of</p>
<p>personalized. We just, we look at like what their history is with running their schedule,</p>
<p>all sorts of stuff. Cause oftentimes people get hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing?</p>
<p>What are the professionals doing? What are the Olympians doing? It&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>the Olympians are doing is they&rsquo;re waking up and they&rsquo;re living and breathing everything around</p>
<p>this one race that they&rsquo;re going to do in four years. Or so it&rsquo;s like, we need to step away from</p>
<p>that. If you&rsquo;re working, you know, 10 hours a day and you got kids and all this other stuff too. So,</p>
<p>um, there&rsquo;s a lot of variables that make it more interesting to coach someone who&rsquo;s actually like</p>
<p>not an elite athlete or someone who&rsquo;s a professional athlete, I should say, uh, the, but,</p>
<p>but yeah, so they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re going to do that stuff. Those, those shorter intervals, um, for</p>
<p>probably about like four to six weeks. If they&rsquo;re doing, if they&rsquo;re doing a longer race, like a</p>
<p>hundred miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we&rsquo;d start bringing those workouts in near the end of</p>
<p>their plan. Cause that&rsquo;s going to be specific to their race pace. That&rsquo;s going to be the intensity</p>
<p>that maybe they&rsquo;re doing for, you know, like a three K or a five K or something like that. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be more relative to what they&rsquo;re going to use. So it follows that philosophy.</p>
<p>The plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early. And then we start</p>
<p>phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of</p>
<p>the plan. And then the distance of, or the time that you&rsquo;re going to spend out doing whatever event</p>
<p>it is, is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there. I wonder if I could ask you for</p>
<p>some sort of advice, maybe almost, uh, maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner and</p>
<p>runner and then see how we can plan stuff out. So which context to give. Okay. So I have been,</p>
<p>first, let me say how much we&rsquo;re currently in Austin. I want to say how much I love Austin for</p>
<p>many reasons. Uh, first and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there&rsquo;s so much love</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>in. It&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately. I mean, I really love,</p>
<p>love it here in Austin. And because I&rsquo;ve been going through a bunch of stressful stuff,</p>
<p>I just kind of gave myself a chance to say, okay, I&rsquo;m going to stick to a diet of carnivore, keto,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to eat as much as I want because, uh, primarily because just barbecue was part of</p>
<p>the love I was getting here. And I was like, either I resist or just give in. And I decided</p>
<p>to give in and actually use this as an opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four</p>
<p>months, plus whiskey and so on. And then the training kind of all, I also let go of the</p>
<p>training a little bit, just to relax, to really focus on the work, focus on the love I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>getting all those kinds of things. But now I just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back</p>
<p>into both competing and grappling, but also doing a, um, hanging out with David Goggins and, uh,</p>
<p>doing a conversation with him, but almost this is my own personal kind of race that I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>forward to. And in terms of distance, that means running with David, uh, something like a marathon</p>
<p>plus plus it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s unclear what plus. So my goal would be to, uh, continue eating carnivore,</p>
<p>which is a whole nother topic that I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about. I feel great psychologically,</p>
<p>sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore and physically,</p>
<p>I love it. I&rsquo;ve never felt any kind of need for carbs to, uh, to improve performance in my running</p>
<p>or anything else. Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a day.</p>
<p>I just, that&rsquo;s when I, uh, feel the best. What else? I also feel best. And this is something</p>
<p>you can push back on. I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever,</p>
<p>and usually the same way every day. So like, I know this is suboptimal. It&rsquo;d be interesting</p>
<p>to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is. Uh, so I think that actually lays</p>
<p>out like where my mind is. I&rsquo;m happy eating carnivore once a day. I like running every day.</p>
<p>Uh, the goal is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months</p>
<p>to do a bunch of competitions and grappling. Okay. With those parameters, I think like you</p>
<p>actually probably would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy.</p>
<p>Like you want that consistency where I&rsquo;m going to do the same thing each day. Uh, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>beat yourself up so much any one day that you can&rsquo;t get out and do it the next one. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>sweet spot with maximum heroic function is the, the, the trademark there is that you,</p>
<p>you can keep going and keep doing it again and again and again, because as long as you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you know, going out one day and trying to do twice as much as what you&rsquo;re ready for, for that</p>
<p>one specific, the key for you is going to be picking the right starting point and then building</p>
<p>from there on what that day kind of entails in terms of how much running you do. So, um,</p>
<p>where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it&rsquo;s a hard, fast rule that you run</p>
<p>an hour every day, seven days a week. But we find out that to run your maximum robot function means</p>
<p>you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes. Then what you would maybe do is you would run</p>
<p>underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes,</p>
<p>maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end. Uh, and then that</p>
<p>middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum road function target. And then maybe after, you know,</p>
<p>four weeks, you start noticing, you know what, this 30 minutes isn&rsquo;t wearing me out near as much as</p>
<p>it used to. Um, I feel like I could easily push past that. Well, let&rsquo;s up that to 40 minutes. So</p>
<p>that 60, you&rsquo;re always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your, your schedule</p>
<p>consistent, your routine consistent. I&rsquo;m wearing a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor</p>
<p>it. Sure. You could do that. You could go perceived effort. Um, I like to use them in tandem in the</p>
<p>sense that like early on, I&rsquo;ll maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for</p>
<p>shorter length. There is heart rate can get messy the longer you go. So I, I end up kind of maybe</p>
<p>stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will at a certain point because I&rsquo;m ultimately</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be usually training or working with someone to run like, you know, a race that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat and things that are going to make the heart rate</p>
<p>super messy. Yeah. But you&rsquo;re probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good.</p>
<p>Mine is actually really weak. Okay. Heart rate then I need to do the, still the work of connecting</p>
<p>heart rate to the perceived effort. Yep. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I would use heart rate for then. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get to a point probably by like in the first couple of months where you, you can still</p>
<p>lean on heart rate if you want, but it&rsquo;ll be kind of one of those things where you keep</p>
<p>looking at, you&rsquo;re like, Oh wow, I can guess it. And you play a game with yourself too. And you</p>
<p>say, well, how close can I guess? You&rsquo;ll get it. So like for me, what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll do the run</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll look at the heart rate afterwards and be like, Oh cool. I was right there. Or I</p>
<p>remember feeling like I was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the</p>
<p>heart rate or. I also love sort of something we haven&rsquo;t talked about. I love pushups and pull ups</p>
<p>of like body weight workouts. Again, it&rsquo;s mostly mental. I just enjoy the mental challenge of it.</p>
<p>I also like, it makes me feel like if all I&rsquo;m doing is running, it makes me feel I&rsquo;m not like.</p>
<p>One dimensional.</p>
<p>Yeah. One dimensional. I mean, there&rsquo;s some aspect to running that&rsquo;s not to be like hippie</p>
<p>about it, but like, you know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re with nature, you&rsquo;re running in the, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re born to do this thing. And that same way, I feel like when I&rsquo;m doing pushups and pull ups,</p>
<p>I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff. Like it&rsquo;s like this body weight exercise that</p>
<p>is, body weight exercises have that way about them. It&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t have that dumbbell feel</p>
<p>or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight. When you&rsquo;re just doing squats,</p>
<p>body weight, we do pushups and pull ups, body weight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff,</p>
<p>body weight. I don&rsquo;t know. I just love the way I feel doing that. So it&rsquo;s usually,</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that part. I combine that with the running afterwards,</p>
<p>doing some basic body weight stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think like you&rsquo;re going to get from, if we&rsquo;re not looking at it from like specifically,</p>
<p>like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations, as well as the</p>
<p>cardiovascular benefits, you&rsquo;re probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that</p>
<p>body weight. So this, and unless you&rsquo;re doing, I guess no rest. Okay. So is it,</p>
<p>you get pretty high heart rate from that. Yeah. Very hard. Okay. Higher than running. Yep.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness,</p>
<p>overall fitness standpoint. I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting that and you&rsquo;re probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too,</p>
<p>I would guess. So there&rsquo;s just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be</p>
<p>doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well. And it sounds like you prefer not to.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s right. So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles?</p>
<p>Is that a big difference? What&rsquo;s a good goal to work towards? Is it marathon and the rest of it</p>
<p>just takes care of itself? Yeah. So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do a</p>
<p>hundred mile after that? Is that what you&rsquo;re saying? I have no idea what the guy. Oh, so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to tell you spot on what you&rsquo;re doing. So you have to be ready for anything. For anything.</p>
<p>Right. My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon.</p>
<p>The longest I&rsquo;ve ever run is 22 miles, but there&rsquo;s been many stretches of my life where I would</p>
<p>regularly run. Like the long run would be close to 20 miles. And then I was comfortably running 10</p>
<p>miles four months ago. Feels like forever ago. Until I injured myself a little bit by running</p>
<p>in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don&rsquo;t realize how much you appreciate</p>
<p>your toes until you stub them. That big toes where all that power comes off. And so it was surprising</p>
<p>how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running, how much I hated</p>
<p>running with it. And then I kept like coming, trying to get back out there to run to think,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s okay. And no, it&rsquo;s not okay. You really need to let it fully heal. At least that</p>
<p>was my experience. I couldn&rsquo;t like just suck it up. It was making it worse every time. And one of</p>
<p>those injuries that could really feel, even though it&rsquo;s so small, but it&rsquo;s essential. So is there any</p>
<p>difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles? Would you say, should I be prepping</p>
<p>for a hundred miles if that&rsquo;s at all a possibility? The big difference is going to be like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dropping intensity significantly by going up to a hundred miles versus the marathon. So</p>
<p>the maximum aerobic function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably gonna be a little closer. It all varies a bit because people will focus on specific</p>
<p>distances and they&rsquo;ll get very efficient and very adapted to that. So it&rsquo;s what makes running kind</p>
<p>of messy where you&rsquo;ll get, for example, the average person can hit their lactate threshold</p>
<p>for probably about 60 minutes or something like that. Whereas you get these elite marathoners</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race. They can push</p>
<p>almost up to their lactate threshold and after lactate threshold for almost like two hours.</p>
<p>So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really have to worry about that too much because you&rsquo;re not really focusing on being</p>
<p>the best possible hundred mile or the best possible marathon. Or you could be, you want</p>
<p>enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you</p>
<p>did the couch to a hundred miles. So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference I think</p>
<p>given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be for the hundred mile. So it&rsquo;s almost given your context. I wouldn&rsquo;t say irrelevant.</p>
<p>You want to be doing running, but you&rsquo;re going to be doing that. Once you put it in your program,</p>
<p>it sounds like it&rsquo;s going to be pretty locked in. If you view it this way, it&rsquo;s probably going to</p>
<p>be more mentally beneficial to where, Hey, today I did my run. I did my body weight exercises. I</p>
<p>did some grappling practice. You know, I spent three hours working out today. If you think of</p>
<p>it like that, then you know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re moving your body, you&rsquo;re doing things that are active for</p>
<p>a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most people. So that&rsquo;s going to actually be very</p>
<p>helpful for you. Uh, the, the problem or the, the, the battle to get over is going to just be like</p>
<p>the, you know, you&rsquo;re going to break down physically running a hundred miles and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna break down physically running a marathon too. So like the, you might just have to push</p>
<p>through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a, a full hundred,</p>
<p>a hundred miler. Would you say it&rsquo;s physical or is it mental discomfort? Like, uh, I mean,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t everything physically uncomfortable? Like what, uh, do you train for if you&rsquo;re training for</p>
<p>the chaos of, uh, so it&rsquo;s not necessarily the hundred miles. It&rsquo;s the chaos of the unexpected,</p>
<p>which might include a hundred miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case. So</p>
<p>like, you need a bit jack of all trades is what you need to be. But also like building up the</p>
<p>confidence or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know. How do you survive a thousand pushups? It&rsquo;s combination of</p>
<p>confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing. Not necessarily the actual</p>
<p>number, but like doing crazy stuff. And the, the second is probably the base strength and endurance</p>
<p>and also just the practicing that process of not quitting. I feel like that&rsquo;s one of the things I</p>
<p>really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>yeah, practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, Nope, uh, I&rsquo;m going to keep doing it.</p>
<p>And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don&rsquo;t want to feel,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like running and doing that. Then you&rsquo;re practicing that muscle of,</p>
<p>um, of doing it anyway. Um, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something you can say in terms of advice,</p>
<p>how to practice the, like doing something unpleasant every day frequently. Yeah. What</p>
<p>I would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the</p>
<p>next if you can. So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be,</p>
<p>it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally,</p>
<p>where if the entire running process is miserable, you&rsquo;re going to be miserable when you step on that</p>
<p>starting line, whether it&rsquo;s a marathon or a hundred miles. So you&rsquo;ve trained yourself that</p>
<p>running equals miserable. Well, and here&rsquo;s the thing. Like if you look at just like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where the literature says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training</p>
<p>plan. And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute. And you just say,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m going to give everyone this schedule and they&rsquo;re going to do this every time rinse</p>
<p>and repeat. My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position</p>
<p>where the training is so boring and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to fall apart very quick because they&rsquo;ve already exhausted themselves mentally,</p>
<p>just trying to do the same old interval every time doing the same old workout. And it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like,</p>
<p>like the, the mix of things within it. So like, rather than like, if I just said, do,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or two minute</p>
<p>intervals or four minute intervals or 62nd intervals, you know, by that sixth week,</p>
<p>they might be so sick of that, that they&rsquo;re not actually maximizing their potential within that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no flavor there. And, and then they&rsquo;re also actually getting less out of themselves</p>
<p>than they would if we just got a little more creative and said, okay, let&rsquo;s mix this up and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do, uh, you know, for one minute intervals, then take a little bit of a break and then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do three minute intervals or at least changing it up from week to week so that they have something</p>
<p>different showing up, even though we&rsquo;re addressing the same kind of physiological adaptation.</p>
<p>Uh, so like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery. You want to be able</p>
<p>to test yourself to the degree where like, when you can recognize these points of, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be here, but I can do it and push through it, but recognize that like, there&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>going to be one event that you want to lean on to get that from because you won&rsquo;t want to make that</p>
<p>one event so miserable that you don&rsquo;t want to do it when it comes time for the challenge. So</p>
<p>if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I&rsquo;m going to go 10 pushups</p>
<p>more than I want to. I&rsquo;m going to get to that point where I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s no more. And then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do 10 more and you&rsquo;re going to make that one miserable. And then maybe on, uh, you</p>
<p>know, Thursdays you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where</p>
<p>you do a few of them and you&rsquo;re like, okay, this is where I&rsquo;d be comfortable to stop. Like, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do two more of them because I know I don&rsquo;t want to do two more of them,</p>
<p>um, but mix that up. So you&rsquo;re not, so at least you&rsquo;re getting enjoyment from some of it and not</p>
<p>just getting complete disgust from the entire process. There&rsquo;s actually quite a lot of ways</p>
<p>that I can introduce misery into the running, get creative, including, um, you know, even just like</p>
<p>stuff outside of the running, like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things,</p>
<p>just introducing random kind of chaos into the, into the system, um, or having conversations with</p>
<p>people as an introvert. It&rsquo;s terrifying. More podcasts. So, um, now starting, uh, the training</p>
<p>and, uh, Zach, you&rsquo;ve been kind enough to also kind of, um, be willing to help me out throughout</p>
<p>this process. So I look forward to where that goes. It&rsquo;s kind of, uh, fascinating. Um, on the</p>
<p>diet side, you&rsquo;re, uh, one of, one of the many things that, uh, make you fascinating is, uh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve played with diet as well and you&rsquo;re, um, somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb</p>
<p>or playing with low carb or meat based diets. Can you describe the potential, like how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet</p>
<p>or a meat based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner? Yeah. And I think like where</p>
<p>a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport? And it&rsquo;s like, well, endurance</p>
<p>sport is quite wide ranging as we&rsquo;ve talked about many, many times here. So there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize, uh, both for the</p>
<p>event you&rsquo;re doing and the intensity that&rsquo;s required for it, the training that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>for that event. And then also the individual component too, where I think this one often</p>
<p>gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we&rsquo;ve got all these Olympic medalists</p>
<p>at the marathon and below distance who are, you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet.</p>
<p>So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in, you know,</p>
<p>say the three K to the marathon. And, you know, in a perfect world, maybe that would be true,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of other variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or</p>
<p>negatively impact that decision choice. So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of</p>
<p>highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with people, he works with people</p>
<p>in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere. And, you know, he&rsquo;s one of the main guys</p>
<p>at Virta health who&rsquo;s, uh, they&rsquo;ve got like a 60% success rate with working with folks with the</p>
<p>type two diabetes to, um, reverse their type two diabetes. Uh, and I mean, that&rsquo;s an astounding,</p>
<p>when you, when you think of just any nutritional protocol, its success rate, they&rsquo;re all incredibly</p>
<p>low. They&rsquo;re very, very low. And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it. Like the</p>
<p>give support. So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about doing something differently, or they don&rsquo;t know what to do rather than just kind</p>
<p>of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and quitting. They, they, they have a resource there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably a big reason why that&rsquo;s the success rate that they have with that,</p>
<p>is they put those support mechanisms in place. That picture needs to be carried into the</p>
<p>performance world or the running world too, where, you know, we may have just been identifying</p>
<p>that, uh, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet</p>
<p>coming from carbohydrate is going to just, it&rsquo;s going to filter those ones towards the Olympics</p>
<p>filter those towards interesting. Yeah. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that like, uh, if we would have taken</p>
<p>say the gold medals in the five came, put them on a low carb diet, they&rsquo;d run faster. They probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t, because we may have already selected that that person&rsquo;s thriving on carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Uh, what I would be interested in is like, you have, let&rsquo;s say we have someone with equal talent,</p>
<p>but got weeded out along the way potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to tolerate like the, both the training and the nutrition requirements that they&rsquo;re being told</p>
<p>to do. So the coaches can, there&rsquo;s a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy diet</p>
<p>and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not,</p>
<p>it would filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training.</p>
<p>I mean, I might be an example of this actually where, you know, you take someone where, uh,</p>
<p>they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren&rsquo;t working for them. Like it&rsquo;s unsustainable for them to</p>
<p>continue that path. Or if they do, they might have a shortened career, so they might be able to eke</p>
<p>out a few really good years, but then, you know, they&rsquo;re not going to be the person they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow, that person&rsquo;s 38 and they&rsquo;re still competing at the Olympics type of a person. Uh, and, you</p>
<p>know, you, you, you put them on a low carb diet, uh, if you can control everything else, like their</p>
<p>entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, uh, you know, they may still have</p>
<p>better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level. But if that&rsquo;s not going to,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point kind of at that, unless they want to be like a kind of a spark in the pan,</p>
<p>so to speak. I just feel good eating meat performance wise. Well, I think there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>group too. And they may just not be the Olympians. Yeah. And so we&rsquo;re not talking,</p>
<p>I guess this conversation has several layers. One is for the Olympics and one is for like,</p>
<p>what is it? Active athletes that are like amateurs, whatever, whatever category I</p>
<p>put myself into, like people that exercise regularly. And then, um, maybe people,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s people who like exercise rarely. So on all of those fronts, I mean,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to live a happy, uh, active life eating meat only or mostly meat?</p>
<p>Yeah. What have you learned about this? Yeah. I think, uh, so for, for some context,</p>
<p>like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate diet for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where there are parts of my training</p>
<p>where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate. And there&rsquo;s periods of my training, especially</p>
<p>like the off season where I&rsquo;m like very low and I might be like kind of in that ballpark of, uh,</p>
<p>like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for, for periods of time.</p>
<p>And what kind of food are we talking about? What&rsquo;s a strict low carb diet?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ranged everywhere from like mostly plant based, low carb keto to like mostly animal based.</p>
<p>I very rarely gone much more than like two weeks strict where it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m strict carnivore or</p>
<p>strict plant based or anything like that. Like we&rsquo;re talking probably more like 95%</p>
<p>at the, at the peak. Um, in terms of any type of like, like longer lasting, uh, from my personal</p>
<p>experience of like being like either in like the animal food camp or her, like the plant based camp</p>
<p>kind of a, of a process. Um, so I&rsquo;ve tried all of them, things that stayed consistent over the 10</p>
<p>years as a kind of the macro nutrient profile that I&rsquo;ve done throughout the course. So one</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t win over the other in terms of meat based versus plant based. Oh, for me, meat based,</p>
<p>definitely. What was, I mean, I was, I was my highest meat consumption in 2019 and that was</p>
<p>by far my best racing season. Yeah. We keep, we keep coming back to that year. That was a good</p>
<p>year for many reasons, philosophically and nutritionally. Yeah. Well in 2020 happened and</p>
<p>now I haven&rsquo;t had a really good chance to, to, uh, to improve. We&rsquo;ll see. Hopefully I&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>more, some more in the tank. That&rsquo;s strange. There&rsquo;s so most athletes that compete at your level</p>
<p>have more carbs integrated into their diets. So what have you learned about using meat in a high</p>
<p>performance? I think it&rsquo;s maybe less about the meat and it&rsquo;s more about like, what are you,</p>
<p>what is it replacing? So if we go, if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people</p>
<p>that, cause I mean, we&rsquo;re getting to the point where I get it&rsquo;s anecdotes, but like, like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we have at the moment. Cause there&rsquo;s, I mean, there is actually a study being done on, like,</p>
<p>I think I guess they&rsquo;d call it hypercarnivore where they&rsquo;re like, I think above 80% of their</p>
<p>intake from meat. Um, and they&rsquo;re looking at a few different things there, but it&rsquo;s so weird</p>
<p>and I keep interrupting, but it&rsquo;s so weird that it sounds unhealthy, uh, hypercarnivore. Yeah. But</p>
<p>it makes me feel really good. So I, that&rsquo;s the individual thing, right? There&rsquo;s countless people</p>
<p>now who like, and I&rsquo;m not saying that they could not have found another route, myself included,</p>
<p>like in 2011, when I switched from moderate to high carbohydrate to low carbohydrate and saw some</p>
<p>very noticeable differences in the way I felt, the way I performed in all this stuff, that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that there wasn&rsquo;t another path. I just did not find that path. And the, the, the fact that</p>
<p>I found a path that was producing the results I was looking for is really all that matters in my</p>
<p>mind. You know, like I don&rsquo;t really care if there was a parallel path that works just as well or,</p>
<p>you know, something like that, because ultimately we only have one shot at everything we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;d be great if I could go back and try four or five different things. Well,</p>
<p>the annoying thing is that the body adjusts to whatever the heck you&rsquo;re doing. So you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to do good science even on yourself. Yeah. I&rsquo;ve referenced my 2019 racing season a few</p>
<p>times and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;d be silly for me to put all of the emphasis on my nutrition plan for that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also comes with two decades of endurance training. So it&rsquo;s possible and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible. And it&rsquo;s very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the culmination</p>
<p>of a lot of work over time from the training side of things. I just think like anytime you hyper</p>
<p>focus on one area or pick a couple of variables and just target those, you find yourself in a</p>
<p>position where you are, you&rsquo;re putting other things in the most uncharitable light possible.</p>
<p>So, so then you have this situation where like, it&rsquo;s actually a combination of a variety of</p>
<p>different things. So where are the big movers? And you know, for me, nutritional shift was pretty</p>
<p>clear that that improved my sleep and my recovery. And I mean, people can say, well, there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>placebo effect, which is a very real concern. But you know, for me personally, a 10 year placebo</p>
<p>effect would be a quite lengthy placebo effect. And I do think it&rsquo;s individual, though I emphasize</p>
<p>that a lot because I mean, I&rsquo;ve worked with tons of people with this and I do see a range from</p>
<p>person to person. I&rsquo;ve worked with people who come to me and they&rsquo;re like strict keto and we raise up</p>
<p>their carbohydrates a bit. And they&rsquo;re like, okay, I feel way better doing it this way. And I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with people who they come to me moderate carbohydrate, but they&rsquo;re interested enough.</p>
<p>They want to try a lower carb. So we, you know, we titrate them down and I&rsquo;ve had clients where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna give them this workout. And they&rsquo;re gonna wish they brought back a little</p>
<p>bit of carbohydrate. And then they go and they nail the workout. And I&rsquo;m just like baffled that</p>
<p>because because they&rsquo;re different from me. And every time, you know, when you have your own</p>
<p>personal experience, the first guttural response is, oh, if I had done it, it would have gone this</p>
<p>way. Why did it go the complete opposite way for them? And you kind of have to just kind of step</p>
<p>out of your own perspective a bit and say like, okay, well they&rsquo;re different, you know, for</p>
<p>whatever reason they&rsquo;re getting, getting along like this. I&rsquo;ve had like several moments in my</p>
<p>life where you kind of realize the body is weird and it&rsquo;s weirder than the average advice. Like</p>
<p>one of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast. First of all, intellectually,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s more known and understandable. But like physically, the fact that I could train,</p>
<p>like not eat 20 hours, 24 hours, and then do a hard like jiu jitsu session for like two hours,</p>
<p>like hard. It&rsquo;s incredible to me. Like this makes no sense. Cause I used to eat like many times a</p>
<p>day. Of course you have to eat, like you don&rsquo;t want to eat too close to the training session</p>
<p>was my thinking, but you definitely need to load up on carbs like three hours before they can,</p>
<p>in order to have enough energy. The fact that I could not eat and have like incredible focus,</p>
<p>but also athleticism, like both endurance and explosive. I mean, jiu jitsu is a special thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like more like chess. It&rsquo;s not like powerlifting, no, not powerlifting, Olympic</p>
<p>lifting, where it&rsquo;s like true explosiveness, but that&rsquo;s fascinating. And it makes me wonder like,</p>
<p>what other things are there to discover about yourself? The annoying thing about food is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>delicious. And so it&rsquo;s hard to do good science on yourself, like to do, you know, for two weeks or</p>
<p>a month to do like strict no carbs. And then maybe next month you add 20 grams or 40 grams of carbs</p>
<p>and see how you actually feel. Not like in that moment, but over a period of several weeks and</p>
<p>then doing everything else right with based on best available science, like with electrolytes</p>
<p>and then vitamins, but then also like remove all the humans from your life that affect you</p>
<p>positively or negatively. Cause you might feel amazing because you&rsquo;re hanging out with cool</p>
<p>people and then, you know, like removing basically all the variables. It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating. And</p>
<p>you kind of, all of us land in a place where we find something that worked for us. And then we</p>
<p>maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out, to stick in that place. And then I suppose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to live life. I guess it&rsquo;s impossible to find the optimal for any of us,</p>
<p>but carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat, a new challenge to the nutritional community,</p>
<p>because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, the nutrition community is probably like, we just got done like dealing with the</p>
<p>vegans and now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us. But I think, well, I mean,</p>
<p>what this all tells, what this all tells me is like, there is a, for one, like in our food</p>
<p>environment, like the failure rate of any one approach at a population level is going to be</p>
<p>incredibly high. I mean, it&rsquo;s why we have, you know, what is it like 88% of the population has</p>
<p>some sort of like metabolic syndrome. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>endless quantity of everything that you can get your hands on for relatively cheap. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that, that presents a problem. If your mindset is going to be, we need this set of</p>
<p>parameters for nutrition and everyone needs to adhere to that or you&rsquo;re wrong. And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well tell that to the person who like went carnivore and cleared up some like crazy skin</p>
<p>ailment or something like that. That&rsquo;s a weird one. Like where the carnivore seems to treat like,</p>
<p>like depression, like mental stuff. It&rsquo;s fascinating. There&rsquo;s all these stories. Again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anecdotes, but it&rsquo;s like the mental one, I think may, I&rsquo;m stepping out a bit on a limb here,</p>
<p>but I want to say like some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Volokh was looking at</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet, which of carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic. I</p>
<p>mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see</p>
<p>doing carnivore, they&rsquo;re cognizant enough that at least if they&rsquo;re doing it for therapeutic reasons,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going like, you know, 50% protein, 50%. They&rsquo;re more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something</p>
<p>like that. And, and I think like you, you do see some, some work with like the brain. So the mental</p>
<p>stuff, I know some of the, I&rsquo;m not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that, that Dr.</p>
<p>Dominic DiAgostino had where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic</p>
<p>stress disorder and that sort of stuff with, with like a strict ketogenic diet. So I wonder if some</p>
<p>of that, like the depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just</p>
<p>fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past, but that&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>wild guesses on my part. And I&rsquo;m deviating from the conversation, but like, no, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>In terms of your own story on food, can you say something? I think we were kind of referring to</p>
<p>diet broadly. Can you say something about how you like to fuel your like, whether it&rsquo;s race or great</p>
<p>training sessions, like maybe the day before, let&rsquo;s go even that far during, and maybe a few</p>
<p>hours after. Okay. It&rsquo;ll be a little different for racing than it will be for like a big workout,</p>
<p>just because the interesting thing about ultra running is just like, you never do the race even</p>
<p>like most endurance races, you&rsquo;re going to cover the distance. You&rsquo;re going to replicate the race</p>
<p>almost up to it in training. Whereas with a hundred miles, you can&rsquo;t, you might replicate a</p>
<p>third of it. So, so I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll walk you through kind of my approach for, for like a hundred mile</p>
<p>race. And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training day. But yeah, so</p>
<p>for where, where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning fat</p>
<p>for ultra marathons. I mean, there&rsquo;s just like the intensity is low. If your, if your ratios are</p>
<p>skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you&rsquo;re going to have to defend your muscle</p>
<p>glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption. And that&rsquo;s just going to be very hard to do over</p>
<p>the course of an entire day, even at low intensities. So it&rsquo;s a fuel tank thing. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than they do. Glycogen stores.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing the low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat and</p>
<p>sparing that muscle glycogen. What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high</p>
<p>levels of fat. So I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;ll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;m going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast the morning of I&rsquo;m going to stay</p>
<p>away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway. And I&rsquo;m going to have something like</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s pretty like a high energy, low volume. So like I&rsquo;ll do like an S fuels, a life</p>
<p>bar. They&rsquo;ve got like, what&rsquo;s in an S fuel life bar? Are we talking about carbs or we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about protein fat and protein? Yeah. Fat protein bar. And then they make some awesome. Yeah. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not as low carb. Yep. Yeah. They make S fuels makes a whole product line. That&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>kind of positioned for a low carb athlete. So they have some products on their lineup that</p>
<p>offers some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on</p>
<p>racing and some of my bigger training sessions and things, but the majority of their products are</p>
<p>low carb. So like they have like, you know how you get like the powders that you put into like your</p>
<p>drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products. They make a version of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like fat based. Oh, cool. That you can mix in with water. Yep. Cool. Yeah. So they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>like a creamer version and then a fruity flavored version. So you can like replicate the taste and</p>
<p>the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink. Science is awesome. I know it is.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s so much of it too, cause people are always like, well, I don&rsquo;t know. I just,</p>
<p>I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever. It&rsquo;s like, well, you can have it now. It just,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t have all that. So you can bring that kind of thing with you. Yeah. So I&rsquo;m leaning</p>
<p>on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy fat protein</p>
<p>stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body&rsquo;s going to be encouraged to start</p>
<p>out burning high levels of fat. Once I get going probably about 45 minutes in, I&rsquo;ll start introducing</p>
<p>small amounts of carbohydrate. So at that point, my body&rsquo;s been revving pretty high fat metabolism</p>
<p>and by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let&rsquo;s say my a hundred</p>
<p>mile, uh, personal record, you know, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m running approximately nine miles every hour.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour&rsquo;s time. Uh, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart</p>
<p>rate I would do for that. I&rsquo;m probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours</p>
<p>of that you can chip away at your muscle glycogen, uh, to the point where you don&rsquo;t necessarily want</p>
<p>to go zero carb. So I&rsquo;m basically just trying to defend what I know I&rsquo;m going to be burning from</p>
<p>the carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams.</p>
<p>Um, and the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40, I can get away</p>
<p>without any digestion issues. So I&rsquo;m not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only concerned about performance on that day, the carbs, the problem, or is it fiber?</p>
<p>Oh, from going above 40 grams or just cause you mentioned digestion issues. Like one of the things</p>
<p>for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein protein and fat is like my stomach just</p>
<p>feels way better. So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra marathon</p>
<p>single day events and it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s very limited in the sense that then it&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fault. It&rsquo;s just, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of great research on a hundred mile race. It&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to study what&rsquo;s going on when someone&rsquo;s running a hundred miles, but they&rsquo;ll say moderate carbohydrate</p>
<p>diet is recommended, but they&rsquo;ll also say that it&rsquo;s like something like 60% of participants are</p>
<p>going to report some sort of like digestion issue during the event. So then it kind of becomes an</p>
<p>issue of, do you want to flip that coin? Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40%.</p>
<p>Right. Exactly. So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any</p>
<p>digestion issues. Um, do I need 40 grams? Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers</p>
<p>that would be like, uh, that, that I would see on, like if I went and actually got a,</p>
<p>like a metabolic heart test or something like that. Um, but it&rsquo;s possible. I mean,</p>
<p>if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour, um, most folks that are</p>
<p>following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to do like 50 to 70 grams</p>
<p>during a single day ultra marathon events. And you&rsquo;ll see some, you know, some recommendations</p>
<p>of up to like a hundred grams, uh, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general, from</p>
<p>like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those things where it&rsquo;s like application</p>
<p>versus like what you can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stretching out distances well past that. And you, you, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m diverting a</p>
<p>little here, but I mean, there&rsquo;s like an approach of like training your gut so you can like be able</p>
<p>to tolerate that much carbohydrate, which you can do, and you may have to, if you&rsquo;re going to follow</p>
<p>a high carbohydrate diet. But again, we go back to that practicality standpoint of if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>professional Olympian who&rsquo;s living and breathing performance and you&rsquo;re burning two to three times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re messing, resting metabolic rate on some days, like you, you may be able to actually</p>
<p>consume a hundred grams of carbohydrate per hour during your training sessions and, and just,</p>
<p>you know, barely stay on top of your nutritional needs. Most people who are running ultra marathons</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to be, you know, probably training much past 10 hours per week. And they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>not going to have the, I&rsquo;ll call it their, a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred grams of</p>
<p>carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able to stay healthy. And, you know,</p>
<p>so I think that&rsquo;s kind of like a, a bit of a, of a non, a non starter for the majority of people,</p>
<p>unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of top performers.</p>
<p>So maybe you can talk about the training, like fueling yourself during training as well.</p>
<p>Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted?</p>
<p>Because as a side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like one</p>
<p>10th of your level of performance, but you know, I, I try to push myself and I just feel much better</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m fasted. So water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles,</p>
<p>but not no food. Yeah. I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach. I do most of my,</p>
<p>my biggest training session usually in the morning. And it usually what will determine</p>
<p>whether I eat something or not before that is like, how much do I need to eat that day in order</p>
<p>to stay on top of it, to build training in the next day. So I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll usually do something</p>
<p>similar to what I do before a race. If I need to kind of stay on top of calories for the day. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like at noon with like no calorie intake and like 5,000 calories to try to consume before</p>
<p>I go to bed that night and get out and do the same thing the next day. But yeah, I think if I were,</p>
<p>if I were doing what you&rsquo;re doing, like if that were my lifestyle, I think I would do almost all</p>
<p>my runs fasted. I don&rsquo;t see why I would be eating a lot before it because it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>introducing something that could, especially if you&rsquo;re noticing, like here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>If I was doing that and I was like, wow, this run sucks. And then I introduced something beforehand</p>
<p>and now my run was feeling great and my progress was getting better. That&rsquo;s when I would maybe</p>
<p>consider having something before. But if you&rsquo;re running both of those, those like self experiments,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re noticing, yeah, if I eat something before I go on this workout, the workouts less enjoyable,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not noticing any, any increased improvements on it. Again, it&rsquo;s a little messy. Like we said</p>
<p>before, it&rsquo;s hard to really, you can&rsquo;t go back and try it a different way on that specific day.</p>
<p>But I think, I think most people, if they&rsquo;re just like, they go at it with like no bias in the sense</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re like trying to make one work versus the other, you can get at least a good enough look</p>
<p>at it. And if absolute peak performance in one activity, one very specific activity isn&rsquo;t your</p>
<p>goal, then it&rsquo;s like, do you really care if one has a 2% performance increase that you won&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>probably notice because there&rsquo;s other variables that will clearly overpower that 2% one way or</p>
<p>the other. And there&rsquo;s some benefit in terms of freedom and letting go of like having to think</p>
<p>about some of these variables. I see sort of fasting as even if it&rsquo;s like a hit on the performance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth it to just not think about it. There&rsquo;s some really nice aspect to just putting on shoes,</p>
<p>not caring like what shorts you wear or like what your outfit is, like not being optimal</p>
<p>in every way and just not caring and just enjoying the purity of just running no matter what.</p>
<p>Just enjoying the natural aspect. There&rsquo;s a side to me that sometimes just like craves a lifestyle</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like I have like such a small house and only what I need and just like a handful of</p>
<p>food products I know I enjoy and work well for me and I don&rsquo;t even have the distraction of the other</p>
<p>stuff. There&rsquo;s almost like a weight that comes off your shoulders when you think even just thinking</p>
<p>about it like it&rsquo;s so simple. So the reason I&rsquo;m mostly a minimalist like that, the reason I have</p>
<p>stuff is I realize like you probably have to fit into society and if you want to have other people</p>
<p>in your life you should probably get used to having stuff because most people like stuff.</p>
<p>Right. Well yeah there&rsquo;s that side of it too and there&rsquo;s a whole, you don&rsquo;t want to ostracize</p>
<p>yourself too much and I think anything you can kind of like you can manipulate that a little</p>
<p>bit where there&rsquo;s things that are like not specific to, that&rsquo;s going to negatively impact</p>
<p>the people around you or your experiences with them. So there&rsquo;s a balance like everything I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean that&rsquo;s why I drink, I think I mentioned you offline, drink vodka, whiskey,</p>
<p>sort of alcohol because I don&rsquo;t feel good about it the day after or sometimes multiple days after</p>
<p>so I know it&rsquo;s not good for me. So I do a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s good for me, everything we talked</p>
<p>about exercise and diet and all those kinds of things but the alcohol almost symbolizes</p>
<p>embracing the chaos of life, the wild and the amazing things that could happen and I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important because if you optimize everything about life then you&rsquo;re going to miss</p>
<p>most of the fun stuff that happens in life. So it&rsquo;s not all about the optimization, it&rsquo;s some of it</p>
<p>like everyone has different things and what they, how they introduce that chaos in a controlled way.</p>
<p>For me alcohol is that because I&rsquo;m okay drinking not too much so I can control that aspect even</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s unhealthy it introduces just the right amount of fun that I embrace it.</p>
<p>Yeah and I mean it is one of those things where it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m going to benefit now and pay later</p>
<p>a little bit too where like and hey if you go and you go out with some friends and drink and you</p>
<p>have memories that last a lifetime from that experience and you paid for it for a couple</p>
<p>days after then hey maybe that&rsquo;s a fair trade off from a life experience.</p>
<p>And part of the vodka thing is I need to honor my ancestors so it&rsquo;s like you have to you know you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t turn your back on your past. Let me ask about the 100 mile world record on the</p>
<p>treadmill. So for most people running a treadmill is really boring so that&rsquo;s kind of their experience</p>
<p>of it that&rsquo;s probably the first thing that would say that seems like really boring to run 100 miles</p>
<p>in a treadmill. Would you say it&rsquo;s boring? Like what were some places your mind went to make that</p>
<p>happen? So this one is interesting to me because I definitely recognized the boredom and the</p>
<p>difference. The thing that the question I can&rsquo;t quite answer I think with it is like could I have</p>
<p>remedied that with better preparation because the scenario that put me on a treadmill for 100 miles</p>
<p>was you know it was March 2020 basically the cascade of every race on the planet got cancelled</p>
<p>and I was in a position where I was going to be doing a runnable 100 miler on a track in</p>
<p>mid to late April so I had like the majority of my training under my belt so I was like kind of</p>
<p>putting the finishing touches on that and I was like oh great here we are like you know what do</p>
<p>I do with this fitness? Do I just scale back and hope the events come back in fall and then peak</p>
<p>again or do I find something to use this fitness for? And the treadmill was the closest thing to</p>
<p>what I had been training for in terms of just like a mechanical like flat running essentially</p>
<p>that I could think of and my thought was okay well I&rsquo;ll just live stream myself on a treadmill</p>
<p>and see what happens. It ended up turning into like a quite a big event. So you don&rsquo;t usually</p>
<p>incorporate treadmill running into your running into your training? I don&rsquo;t not incorporate it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t incorporate it in the way that would be necessarily conducive to uh you know dealing</p>
<p>with the mental aspects of being on a treadmill for 100 miles. Was it that different than running</p>
<p>on a track? It was from the sense that here&rsquo;s the way I describe it is when I&rsquo;m on a track it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>controlled environment and everything can be very uniform but there are tiny little micro adjustments</p>
<p>and pace that that I&rsquo;m doing subconsciously that give me the sense of control. Right. No I might</p>
<p>run the exact same split but there&rsquo;s like a fraction of a second or you know a fraction</p>
<p>second faster than a fraction of seconds slower that equals the same outcome. It gives you that</p>
<p>sense of control. You&rsquo;re determining how fast you&rsquo;re going. On a treadmill you&rsquo;re responding</p>
<p>to the belt so the advantage is you can set a pace and know you&rsquo;re hitting it. The disadvantage is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being told what to do by that machine and that gets very frustrating. I&rsquo;ve felt like I wanted</p>
<p>to step off like you get to like certain points where you&rsquo;re just like like even stepping off</p>
<p>what I noticed I learned this on the day of actually I noticed there&rsquo;s something where it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really matter how long I get off like I get off to use the bathroom and that was a little</p>
<p>bit of a longer break. Then I had like a hiccup during my event where we ran so much power through</p>
<p>one end of the house that the screen on the treadmill was blacking out. So I ended up jumping</p>
<p>back and forth on treadmills for quite a bit in the beginning and I noticed even turning it off</p>
<p>stepping on the other and starting the other one up gave me like you know a handful of seconds</p>
<p>between was enough of a mental break of just like that release of being told what to do to reset.</p>
<p>So maybe if you were in the future you would figure out what exactly how much is needed to</p>
<p>have that mental break. I never actually thought about that that I mean obviously for you but also</p>
<p>for people like me like amateur runners that that&rsquo;s a source of frustration with the treadmill</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s sometimes small adjustments in pace that we do running not on the treadmill on the</p>
<p>ground that feel like essential. Just like you said that experience of control like</p>
<p>feeling like you&rsquo;re in control somehow that&rsquo;s really I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s somehow liberating</p>
<p>in the way that a treadmill can be just the source of frustration. The funny thing though</p>
<p>about the treadmill is I actually like to do faster workouts on the treadmill like long intervals or</p>
<p>something like that or tempo runs because for that type of stuff sometimes for those I want</p>
<p>to release the brainpower required to hit that pace and say you take care of that and for that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun but those are over quick so you don&rsquo;t really run into the times. Yeah that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>for like precise control of pace. You&rsquo;ve also during that stream got to interact one of the</p>
<p>greatest athletes of all time, Berg Kreischer. What&rsquo;s your he&rsquo;s actually doing I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re paying attention to this but I guess he has a goal of running 2,000 miles this year. Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a chance to talk to Joe Rogan yesterday about this which is fascinating. I think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit doubtful of Bert&rsquo;s ability to be the ultra performer that he so naturally is. Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts about Bert as a runner? What&rsquo;s your advice to him and what was your</p>
<p>interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him? I love Bert because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a nice person. I mean as a guy who&rsquo;s just accelerated in popularity over the last few years</p>
<p>like he is like super kind so for folks who are curious like I&rsquo;ve met Bert a couple years earlier</p>
<p>and I just randomly asked him like hey I&rsquo;m doing this live stream thing we&rsquo;re doing it for fight</p>
<p>for the forgotten we&rsquo;re trying to raise some funds for them would you want to come on the live</p>
<p>stream for a bit and I thought maybe he&rsquo;d come off like five or ten minutes and I thought that&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be amazing if he did that he ended up coming on for like over an hour he said he went past his slot</p>
<p>sat in the next slot and just started talking with some of the other guests it&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like Bert is definitely like I feel like he&rsquo;s as unchanged from like his popularity as one can get</p>
<p>away with and it&rsquo;s just like his his lifestyle I think is very unpredictable in the sense that like</p>
<p>if he wants to run like x time for a specific race that&rsquo;s going to pull away from his lifestyle so</p>
<p>much to focus on that luckily for him he&rsquo;s actually a great athlete like you it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s under that layer</p>
<p>of uh of fat yeah so for people who are not familiar Bert Kresch is a comedian who takes off</p>
<p>his shirt often has he&rsquo;s a uh uh elegant layer of fat around him he&rsquo;s also a party animal so he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird balance of like healthy and unhealthy yeah so he drinks a lot during I think there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>debate about that but certainly after his uh his performances but at the same time he&rsquo;s into kind of</p>
<p>the running thing and he does quite a bit of treadmill running I think so and like I said</p>
<p>has this challenge of running 2000 miles this year so it&rsquo;s fascinating to have somebody who</p>
<p>so fully embraces life and the full joys of life as represented by the huge amounts of drinking and</p>
<p>partying and just being a wild man but also at the same time like being at least curious about this</p>
<p>challenging yourself in the physical realm it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating it reminds me of um one of</p>
<p>my favorite comedians like Eddie Izzard who&rsquo;s been doing those challenges basically off the</p>
<p>couch just running um a marathon a day kind of thing it&rsquo;s fascinating to see the purity of those</p>
<p>challenges when like exercise hasn&rsquo;t necessarily been deeply ingrained in your life and you kind</p>
<p>of just embrace the challenge anyway and take it on and that&rsquo;s another way of looking at it</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been talking about running as a a performance like optimization thing where training</p>
<p>is such a huge part of this process like race day is just the cherry on top but there&rsquo;s for some</p>
<p>people where the race is the cake yeah it&rsquo;s like they just take it on as a pure challenge as the</p>
<p>as the as the thing you haven&rsquo;t really trained for as the thing you haven&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the intricacies of but you take it on anyway and that that reveals something about the human spirit</p>
<p>as well yeah and there&rsquo;s definitely like a switch that flips when you in your mind is saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to do this where then all of a sudden it goes from like you stop thinking about oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not possible to like well i&rsquo;m just going to do it and i think Burt highlights that perfectly in a</p>
<p>lot of cases where like he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s maybe not even thinking it through enough to get to the point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like he gets the point where he thinks this is not possible where most people would look</p>
<p>at it and think huh i don&rsquo;t know if i can actually physically accomplish that task Burt&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>oh yeah i&rsquo;m gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing where he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing is where are we gonna find</p>
<p>him at the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on 100 miles and that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen and it&rsquo;s going to be hilarious uh so speaking of things that are insane</p>
<p>and like taking on challenges that don&rsquo;t seem like you didn&rsquo;t you didn&rsquo;t think through uh</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re thinking about running across the country in in a challenge you call the transcontinental</p>
<p>run can you describe this challenge and what the heck you&rsquo;re thinking yeah yeah so this is uh you</p>
<p>know one thing that is exciting about ultra marathons i think in a lot of places especially</p>
<p>early in someone&rsquo;s ultra marathon adventure if they decide to do that as a you know part of their</p>
<p>life is you have like these early years where you&rsquo;re doing things for the first time and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like so cool and scary at the same time to think today i&rsquo;m gonna run 100 miles and the first ever</p>
<p>run before is 50 or something like that and you just know you&rsquo;re gonna do something that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done before you&rsquo;re gonna experience things you would have never been able to predict</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this really interesting unique like human experience i think so for me i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent most of my career at this point like doing i got through that phase and a lot of the events</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really interested in and then it was like now let&rsquo;s repeat it and see if we can do it better</p>
<p>and you get into that mindset for a while which is also a fun mindset but there is that kind of</p>
<p>like uh desire to kind of have that human experience again of like you know not knowing</p>
<p>what could happen or is this doable type of a thing but still doing it and figuring it out</p>
<p>along the way so i would describe the transcontinental project as something like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not anything unique to me or anything new there&rsquo;s been a lot of people who&rsquo;ve done it before</p>
<p>but essentially it&rsquo;s a route there&rsquo;s different routes there&rsquo;s one kind of main one that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>for like the that is used as the record route more or less that you go from san francisco to</p>
<p>new york and essentially you live out of an rv uh while you&rsquo;re running so you run as much as you</p>
<p>can during the day then you go to bed at night and then you get up and do it again and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re handling all the logistics and the process of trying to make sure you can get up the next day</p>
<p>and do again what you did the day before which is going to be the biggest difference so for me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done all single day ultra marathons where you&rsquo;re going to wring yourself dry at knowing the</p>
<p>next day or week or however long you need you&rsquo;re going to be able to just kind of like shut</p>
<p>everything down and let everything catch back up whereas with this like you know you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>again and again again yeah and you know the record is by a guy named p costa who averaged just over</p>
<p>72 miles a day finished in 42 days six hours and 30 minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73 miles</p>
<p>and then like next day again next day again just knowing every day when you finish you spend a whole</p>
<p>day running and then okay i&rsquo;m gonna go to bed i&rsquo;m gonna wake up in the morning i&rsquo;m gonna have to do</p>
<p>this again and then you know have that happen for six weeks and that&rsquo;s if it goes very well</p>
<p>so luck i assume is a big part of this yeah for sure i mean there&rsquo;s just so many variables that</p>
<p>are uncontrollable on this type of an experience just because i mean you go over the sierras maybe</p>
<p>you hit a storm you know you try to time it most people do it in sep start in september so you</p>
<p>can get over the mountain passes without a big storm coming through uh but then also get to the</p>
<p>east coast before it&rsquo;s like the middle of winter so like september early september start is kind</p>
<p>of ideal but you can you know i mean pete was very fortunate from a weather standpoint i think</p>
<p>he made one big mistake he got a little too aggressive beginning had to take a full day off</p>
<p>so he actually averaged from a moving day standpoint closer to 75 miles per day um but</p>
<p>yeah i mean there&rsquo;s going to be things that i can&rsquo;t prepare for won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>you know a lot of that will get a lot of the logistical stuff will get leaned on with the crew</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s i mean that&rsquo;s the hardest part right now is just like getting all that put together</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like okay i need to have the rv ready i need to have all the stuff and we need to have</p>
<p>the places figured out where we&rsquo;re going to stop and and the people that can you know dedicate</p>
<p>that much time to an activity like that you know there&rsquo;s a lot of moving parts even before you</p>
<p>start the adventure itself when are you see you&rsquo;re taking the san francisco to new york yeah and when</p>
<p>are you doing the the run september 1st is when uh you know barring anything like catastrophic</p>
<p>between now and then it&rsquo;s really exciting but i mean this is incredible so you you&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>have a bunch of people just randomly running with you are people going to be tracking where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>located yeah so i&rsquo;ll be documenting everything because i mean my hope is that i&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>primarily to raise awareness for fight for the forgotten justin wren&rsquo;s charity uh but with that</p>
<p>said i think i am capable of uh if i have a good experience uh you know chasing the record or going</p>
<p>after the record or at least getting close to it so oh shit so you&rsquo;re gonna try to beat this record</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m gonna go out with the i&rsquo;m gonna structure the process in a way that leaves</p>
<p>that door open is the way i would describe it i&rsquo;m gonna try not to do anything that would potentially</p>
<p>put it in a situation where that becomes the primary goal just because i want to make sure</p>
<p>that the reason i decided to do in the first place was for fight for the forgotten so i want</p>
<p>to make sure that i don&rsquo;t end up two thirds of the way across the country with a broken leg and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like hey guys uh i guess the donation button&rsquo;s turned off so focus on like don&rsquo;t sacrifice that</p>
<p>right that goal but also there&rsquo;s a community aspect to it that i feel like are you going to</p>
<p>i mean so you&rsquo;re going to document and post yeah but are you going to also is there a safety</p>
<p>perspective here it&rsquo;s like the forest gum thing you might have large numbers of crowds that run</p>
<p>along with you for a while yeah are you worried about that kind of thing i wouldn&rsquo;t say i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>worried about i mean i think there&rsquo;s probably there&rsquo;s remote enough spots along the way where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get some alone time more more likely i don&rsquo;t necessarily mind if people want to jump in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll there&rsquo;ll be some people that will definitely want to do that and and they can come</p>
<p>in and but the reality is like it&rsquo;s probably not going to be a scenario where there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know 40 people following me at all times you say that now yeah you never know just wait for</p>
<p>this podcast yeah and then if joe finds out you&rsquo;re doing this then we&rsquo;re in trouble all right so um</p>
<p>i mean what are the things that you think will be the hardest for you and also like how do you</p>
<p>train for this kind of thing um and what yeah what are the hardest things you anticipate how do you</p>
<p>train for them yeah so the way i&rsquo;m looking at this is it&rsquo;s much less about performance from</p>
<p>the traditional sense where i need to be able to be x fit i think i need to be injury proof that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to be a detriment if you think about it like if i manage to average nine minute mile</p>
<p>pace for a day that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time frame so i&rsquo;ll easily have 12 hours</p>
<p>of moving time per day um nine minute pace i think is slow enough that it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable clip</p>
<p>so like when you i mean obviously there&rsquo;s things that slow you down or i&rsquo;ll probably take walking</p>
<p>breaks you know stopping breaks you got to stay on top of nutrition that&rsquo;s the other big thing too i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know probably eating like anywhere between 10 to 15 000 calories a day which is you know i can</p>
<p>probably count on my hand a couple of occasions where i&rsquo;ve eaten that much in my life so now i</p>
<p>got to do that for six plus weeks in a row and you don&rsquo;t want any having a stomach problem i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to try to minimize the amount of stomach problems so you would you estimate about 12 to 13</p>
<p>to 14 hours of running every day yeah that&rsquo;s probably like from from the first step to the</p>
<p>last step it&rsquo;ll probably be somewhere around like say 14 hours 13 hours or something like that would</p>
<p>be a pretty good estimate and then getting rest and so and then minimizing the risk of injury</p>
<p>which could be as small as like like literally uneven surfaces resulting to like stepping the</p>
<p>wrong way i mean that&rsquo;s going to be a lot of steps yeah yeah uh huh so the probability of injury are</p>
<p>you worried about that kind of stuff is can you strengthen the ankles or those kinds of things</p>
<p>that prevent yeah possibility of injury and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s where i&rsquo;m putting a lot of my focus in is</p>
<p>i think like just being running fit is going to be like generally speaking is going to be</p>
<p>important i&rsquo;m going to i think just from a lifetime of running is going to be a huge advantage</p>
<p>a lot of these like kind of like mechanical movements are going to be very established</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to be about can i tolerate that volume of it there i think that i&rsquo;m doing more</p>
<p>strength work i think this is something where it&rsquo;s like you know maybe adding five pounds of</p>
<p>lower body muscle is going to be an advantage versus a disadvantage when you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>power weight ratio because i just don&rsquo;t really don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t i never need to be running a 648</p>
<p>mile for this adventure um and i so i&rsquo;m looking at that i&rsquo;m doing a lot more of that stuff focusing</p>
<p>on that the training is changing a fair bit where it&rsquo;s more polarizing versus kind of being</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ve always had some polarization in my training but this is even to an extreme where</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m going to do some simulations where uh you know i go out and do two or three days where i</p>
<p>target the exact thing i will be doing on the transcon you were on instagram posting about</p>
<p>these simulated runs so you legitimately like trying to perfectly copy what would happen in</p>
<p>one two or three day segment on that run yeah just to kind of start to weed out where are the</p>
<p>potential problems so let&rsquo;s say i do a two or three day simulation where i&rsquo;m averaging 70 miles a day</p>
<p>and i find out at the end of three days there&rsquo;s a really weak spot here um i need to address that or</p>
<p>i need to find a way to make that not a weak spot i think that&rsquo;s the only way to really get as close</p>
<p>as you can to avoiding injury have you done that yet have you done a two day 70 mile like even that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredibly difficult i haven&rsquo;t yet i&rsquo;m going to build up to it because that&rsquo;s the other thing too</p>
<p>is like i don&rsquo;t think you want to be so aggressive with that where you get injured trying to figure</p>
<p>out how not to get injured uh so i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll what i&rsquo;m going to start what i just started last week</p>
<p>is i&rsquo;ve uh it looks really weird on my training schedule because like last week i ran almost 150</p>
<p>miles but i took two days off so it&rsquo;s like usually for me to get to 150 miles that&rsquo;s a seven day</p>
<p>training week uh so that&rsquo;s the way i&rsquo;m doing it like i did i did a day where i did uh you know</p>
<p>two like just over 20 milers separated with by just a couple hours and within that couple hours</p>
<p>i did like a three mile walk the following morning i woke up and ran i think it was like</p>
<p>just over 36 miles first thing in the morning just to get an idea of just like kind of like</p>
<p>what is it like to be i mean this was in phoenix too so it was 100 degrees for the majority of that</p>
<p>just suffer then rest yeah suffer again how that feels there&rsquo;s enough precedent with this sort of</p>
<p>an activity where like everyone i&rsquo;ve talked to so far has told me like there is going to be like</p>
<p>this kind of like gradual decline in the early stages where you&rsquo;re just like okay it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>worse it&rsquo;s getting worse it&rsquo;s getting worse and you hit a point where you&rsquo;re just like it hits</p>
<p>kind of rock bottom and then like it starts to kind of gradually improve so you kind of have to</p>
<p>let yourself get it&rsquo;s weird i think i can maybe eliminate i&rsquo;m trying to find a way to eliminate</p>
<p>some of that by doing the simulations whereas i from what i&rsquo;ve seen i haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of people</p>
<p>do the simulation route yet i&rsquo;ve seen people just do like a lot of training and then say like okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll spend the first seven to ten days adapting to this and then i&rsquo;ll get comfortable within this</p>
<p>environment and be fine whereas i&rsquo;m going to try to get to a point where like some of that is</p>
<p>already kind of cleared up before i start but not so much that i&rsquo;m like adding like an extra</p>
<p>central week to the trip with worth of running what do you think will be the hardest simulator</p>
<p>run leading up to like will you do three days yeah i think i&rsquo;ll probably try to do three days</p>
<p>somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each will be kind of like the goal will that be in august do</p>
<p>you think how close to yeah i would like it to be in august like early august would be ideal i think</p>
<p>like maybe the first week in august because that gives me kind of three weeks to let things kind</p>
<p>of settle down from that but then it&rsquo;s crazy this is incredible it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually interesting</p>
<p>because like if i did let&rsquo;s say i did the simulation now um the problem with that is</p>
<p>like the adaptations from just like the breakdown and the strengthening would likely be gone unless</p>
<p>i did it again uh so i want to inch up to it so that like and get close enough to the starting</p>
<p>date so that i&rsquo;m still kind of like you know holding on to that adaptation when i start it</p>
<p>so then those first few days maybe aren&rsquo;t quite as miserable and you said uh if everything goes</p>
<p>amazing and you&rsquo;re challenging the record it&rsquo;ll be like a 42 day run yeah so that&rsquo;s what the record</p>
<p>is almost exactly six weeks and that&rsquo;s at 72 and a half miles per day so will you be posting online</p>
<p>and like yeah instagram&rsquo;s gonna be a big one i think i might do a few like youtube stuff along</p>
<p>the way too um yeah i&rsquo;m still ironing out exactly how much i think at minimum i&rsquo;ll do i&rsquo;ll do some</p>
<p>instagram stuff i think i&rsquo;ll go live on instagram a few times during the day when i take like walking</p>
<p>breaks uh partly just to kind of i think keeping people i mean it stays true to the the goal of</p>
<p>raising awareness but it also i find when you bring people in there is an added pressure to</p>
<p>that but there&rsquo;s also this sense that i&rsquo;ve learned from the treadmill experience since we had like</p>
<p>a pretty big production for that in the sense that i mean as much as you can turn on a camera</p>
<p>in your own house but like the i remember thinking we had like 30 people lined up to</p>
<p>come in and guest speak during that and there&rsquo;s points of that where i was like you know you get</p>
<p>that voice we talked about the beginning where it&rsquo;s like you know maybe you could quit like</p>
<p>you really need to run 100 miles on a treadmill is this really going to be valuable for you</p>
<p>and then you think about oh you know what there&rsquo;s uh you know courtney dewalter one of the best</p>
<p>female ultra runners to ever exist is taken in the 30 minutes to an hour out of her day</p>
<p>to come on in two hours to you know help me you know amplify this event and do i really want to</p>
<p>be sending emails out to these people saying hey guys i know you were gracious enough to</p>
<p>block out time of your day you know i think there&rsquo;s a little bit of that to do where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re jumping in with the community that is following along and saying</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how things are going show them the best the worst and everything between and then ultimately</p>
<p>have that hold you accountable a little bit too it&rsquo;s like hard to get up in the morning and not</p>
<p>go back out i don&rsquo;t know how you are but i had to uh whenever i did any kind of physical stuff</p>
<p>like the 48 hour challenge or just any kind of running i hated turning on the camera yeah i hated</p>
<p>it like because you have to like smile and be friendly and stuff oh i&rsquo;m just gonna be super</p>
<p>miserable if i&rsquo;m miserable well that&rsquo;s it so like exactly in some sense that&rsquo;s what people</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re gonna get a happy zac or an angry exactly it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re making bets</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be some days maybe not many maybe very few where you&rsquo;re truly happy with</p>
<p>yourself like for some weird ecstatic reason maybe if you get over the hump whatever that you mentioned</p>
<p>that this dip i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fascinating how many how much suffering this actually entails</p>
<p>i wonder well and one thing i&rsquo;m gonna definitely try to leverage to my advantage and one of the</p>
<p>reasons why i think fight for the forgotten was the charity that really triggered me to decide to</p>
<p>do this the transcontinental route was something i learned about early in my ultra running career</p>
<p>and i thought to myself i want to do that someday but it was one of those kind of far off distance</p>
<p>things that had never really like actualized in your mind until you put a date down or</p>
<p>you know mention it on the joe rogan experience or something like that</p>
<p>when then it then it&rsquo;s like people want to know when is this happening and uh um you know what i</p>
<p>try to think about is you know the reason justin identified the pygmy tribe was because they were</p>
<p>super forgotten where you know we think about just like some of these third world countries where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a scenario of like some people it&rsquo;s easy for us here in the us to think to ourselves well why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they just industrialize why don&rsquo;t they just like you know start to innovate a bit why are they</p>
<p>so primitive what&rsquo;s wrong with them and in reality like when you take uh when you scale things down</p>
<p>to the degree where you need the entire day because of the situation you&rsquo;re in just to take</p>
<p>care of your basic needs of water and food you never get the opportunity to even build a real</p>
<p>like establishment or you know a build on that like you need you need the free time or you need</p>
<p>a portion of your population to have the free time available to innovate and the pygmy tribe just</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t had that historically in fact they weren&rsquo;t even considered humans by like the local government</p>
<p>for quite some time and you know the people that really pay the price in some of these situations</p>
<p>are the women because they&rsquo;re the ones that get saddled with like the water gathering and things</p>
<p>like that so the reason that justin picked wells to build was because he thought to himself if we</p>
<p>can get them wells then now these women don&rsquo;t spend all day walking and carrying water now they</p>
<p>can just get that water and now we have half the population freed up for other things now maybe they</p>
<p>can start farms they can build some housing and stuff like that and it just it exponentially</p>
<p>improves once you take care of some of those big key early things so when i&rsquo;m thinking about like</p>
<p>you know do i really need to go out here and travel another 12 hours a day my mind is going</p>
<p>to hopefully go to well if one of those women woke up in the pygmy tribe one morning deciding you</p>
<p>know what do i really need to go get water today well yeah you do you really do have to yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running for that uh huh yeah and that that will give you fuel hopefully but yeah yeah i mean the</p>
<p>reality is always there where i don&rsquo;t have to do it like they do have to do it so you know but i</p>
<p>think just keeping that perspective it it puts us back to the beginning where it&rsquo;s this is one of</p>
<p>those situations where i think it&rsquo;s like uh a no quit situation you have to put yourself in a no</p>
<p>quit situation here because it&rsquo;s uh you know it&rsquo;s just bigger than you i can&rsquo;t wait to see like the</p>
<p>dark places you go i mean there&rsquo;s some yeah the the quit situations and hopefully we get to have</p>
<p>a glimpse of those because i think those are really inspiring when somebody is uh both gets</p>
<p>broken by them because you know how tough you are but also is almost broken and overcomes it i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just fascinating stories i can&rsquo;t wait i i know does joan know you&rsquo;re doing this by the way</p>
<p>yeah i sent him i sent him a note a while back because he was the first spot i mentioned it on</p>
<p>so i think he knows i&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s following along about the exact starting date or not you will</p>
<p>know this is great you probably think you&rsquo;re a crazy uh mfr for doing this but uh i think you</p>
<p>love it and i think i love it and i think the world will love it ridiculous question who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest endurance runner or endurance athlete of all time oh that&rsquo;s a good question um i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d probably go maybe two directions here uh i think uh heli geber lassie is one of the best</p>
<p>in my opinion because just i mean 27 world records like like not all the different distance but like</p>
<p>braking and rebraking and that sort of stuff um i mean he ran two what was it 203</p>
<p>359 before the shoe technology came in that is estimated at anywhere between a two to eight</p>
<p>percent performance advantage i&rsquo;m talking about a two hour marathon 203 yep two hour three minutes</p>
<p>yeah so he did that with the old shoe technology which uh essentially dates back to anything if</p>
<p>if you were a nike athlete it could date back to as early as i think early 2016 is when the first</p>
<p>prototype started showing up uh so if you&rsquo;re before that in your career you were using you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>guaranteed to be using the old shoe technology um and i mean just the range of it too and uh</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard i mean there&rsquo;s there it&rsquo;s uh is he a marathon runner purely</p>
<p>no he did everything that&rsquo;s why i pick him i think because he he he went everywhere</p>
<p>everything from the 800 and is like at a national level yeah at a national level i don&rsquo;t he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>competing at like olympics or anything in the 800 but he was he was mostly like 5k to marathon</p>
<p>um yeah yeah so just incredible i mean i i could go a totally different direction too i think like</p>
<p>steve prefontaine stands out in as an american runner just because if you look at it outside</p>
<p>of just like performances and stuff like that i think um he basically like you can&rsquo;t find an</p>
<p>american male runner who probably didn&rsquo;t get some motivation or some catalyst into their running</p>
<p>journey from a prefontaine story or what would you say is inspiring about prefontaine uh like from the</p>
<p>philosophy from the technique from his story uh i think there&rsquo;s a few things i mean there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of things which is why he is who he is it&rsquo;s uh one was just his attitude about it where um he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like this picture ask runner uh i mean he was obviously talented but you know you have the</p>
<p>perfect story of like he wanted to be good at something you like most american kids tried</p>
<p>football was no hard work was gonna get prefontaine starting in varsity for football starts running</p>
<p>fell in love with the mile uh his college coach told him no you&rsquo;re not gonna be a miler you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a 5k guy and he popularized the 5k in the united states or three mile in some cases</p>
<p>and uh i mean he the way he would race i think is what really made him interesting for folks</p>
<p>where he would he was just like all guts runner where he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s like i mean one of his famous</p>
<p>quotes was like if you if you beat me you&rsquo;re gonna have to bleed to do it because he&rsquo;s gonna be an</p>
<p>all guts race in in a sport where it gets very tactical at times especially at the like national</p>
<p>or i shouldn&rsquo;t say national but at the like competition level the championship level where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like kind of more of a sit and kick approach a lot of times where everyone&rsquo;s kind of waiting</p>
<p>for someone to make a move like pre was gonna make a move really early yeah so this idea of</p>
<p>leading from the front which i guess is tactically really a bad idea well from a</p>
<p>from a running a pr standpoint it&rsquo;s a bad idea in most cases but so a race i guess is not just about</p>
<p>the pr so race winning in a lot of cases and that&rsquo;s what he thought was going to put him in</p>
<p>the best advantage to win i think it&rsquo;s just the run from the front i mean what what do you because</p>
<p>you mentioned this uh the 100 mile you ran you were in second place and then in 90s you were</p>
<p>able to get to the first place how hard is it to run when you&rsquo;re in first place you know i think</p>
<p>this is really different some people thrive under it where it&rsquo;s like for them i mean like i talked</p>
<p>about jim walsh before i think he loves being in the front if he&rsquo;s in the front he loves it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s excited that&rsquo;s where he knows he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s doing what he&rsquo;s doing where he&rsquo;s pushing his limits</p>
<p>and things like that uh pre was probably the same way and i think there&rsquo;s other folks who are much</p>
<p>more comfortable kind of saying let&rsquo;s let things settle down here a little bit and then i&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>my move when it&rsquo;s time to make my move or they think of it as and this is a very important i</p>
<p>think lesson for for the average ultra runner is just like knowing what you&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>is going to be an important piece to the puzzle because you can like you you you can try to say</p>
<p>i want to run faster than i&rsquo;m capable of in an early part of a hundred miler but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pay for it at the end so really unless you&rsquo;re trying to go for the win and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tactic that you think is going to produce a win versus trying to run your fastest time you got</p>
<p>to run within yourself within your parameters obviously there&rsquo;s a big question about where</p>
<p>those parameters are in a lot of cases which makes ultra marathon even more interesting because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so much unknown about it it&rsquo;s like well maybe you can go faster and we just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know yet so there&rsquo;s in the face of that uncertainty there&rsquo;s something admirable like it was with</p>
<p>prefontaine where you take the risk and run faster than you know you you think you might be able to</p>
<p>run in terms of pace that you can hold so push the pace that&rsquo;s possible yeah explore the unknown</p>
<p>explore it&rsquo;s like a pioneer spirit right yeah you know the next frontier kind of a thing but</p>
<p>i mean prefontaine also there&rsquo;s other angles with him too where he was like in the amateur era where</p>
<p>to be an olympian you couldn&rsquo;t be pro so he&rsquo;s turning down i mean the guy was on food stamps</p>
<p>and living in a trailer because he wanted to run at the olympics and there was a lot of like</p>
<p>politics involved with not being able to take take sponsorship money and things like that which</p>
<p>has changed since then but so he was huge in the movement for that to kind of like you know have a</p>
<p>situation where now as an athlete you can finish in most cases finish college sign a big contract</p>
<p>with you know a sponsor and then also still compete in the olympic games and go to the events</p>
<p>that are actually ones that are going to likely catapult your career and most of the olympic</p>
<p>distance endurance events so so he just revolutionized the sport and then to add even</p>
<p>more flavor to the whole thing i mean he died a very premature death he got a car accident and</p>
<p>died before he would have likely probably medaled at the olympics so he and there is a tragedy the</p>
<p>fact that he didn&rsquo;t yeah well he was fourth place at the olympics the prior his first go of it and</p>
<p>it was kind of one of those things where it&rsquo;s like fourth place at the olympics is the first man</p>
<p>looking out of the first woman looking out and for a guy that had as much hype as him i think</p>
<p>like a medal was something he really wanted to take home with him there and especially how that</p>
<p>race went i mean yeah i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tragic the whole thing but that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that makes olympics amazing is the tragedy of it like one race decides the story of a lifetime which</p>
<p>is like yeah that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s amazing even if a lot of people get hurt because of it</p>
<p>tragedy makes the the triumph special right yeah and well it makes i mean it makes life</p>
<p>like a movie almost exactly you know if everything&rsquo;s all sunshine and rainbows then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as entertaining to watch yeah there&rsquo;s no adversity to overcome you mentioned shoe technology</p>
<p>how much has shoe technology advanced through the past few decades how much has it changed running</p>
<p>generally but also running like ultra marathon running i would say an ultra running it&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>much of a less of an impact because ultra running is still heavily skewed towards the trails so the</p>
<p>technology at least from what we know isn&rsquo;t necessarily translating over to these like</p>
<p>massive varied terrain certainly not the technical terrain and things like that now on road races</p>
<p>flat stuff like the track stuff the roads the run i guess you a runnable trail um where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like basically crushed limestone more or less uh you definitely get an advantage from it it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>and essentially what what happened um is in this probably dated back actually before 2015 uh you</p>
<p>know nike decided well their their their uh development team uh was ahead of the curve they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>developed this new foam they call like a pibak foam uh and they they realized that like when you</p>
<p>step down into a shoe the reason like uh racers a lot of times would wear these flats because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to take out any of that lost energy into the foam in the shoe well this foam that nike</p>
<p>came out with is so good that it actually returns way more energy than the average foam did to the</p>
<p>point where like when they test these things on like force plate treadmills and things like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a depending on the person&rsquo;s gait and some of things like a two to eight percent</p>
<p>improvement in performance i mean we&rsquo;ve seen records just across the board get broken since</p>
<p>this came out all distances basically yeah yeah i i think from at least from the 5k up through</p>
<p>the marathon and i mean we&rsquo;ve seen some insane improvements in the marathon i think like uh the</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s marathon went from what was considered relatively untouchable like 216 to a 214 and</p>
<p>i mean like it was like 218 was like just world class like if you could run a 218 marathon as a</p>
<p>woman that was like i mean it still is to a degree but then you know now you have someone run a 214</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a huge and you attributed a lot of that to the the shoe yeah yeah i think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably other things that come in mind too like now that people know there&rsquo;s a performance</p>
<p>advantage from a mechanical standpoint it&rsquo;s also a confidence thing where it&rsquo;s like oh now i can</p>
<p>probably try going five seconds per mile faster and maybe they could have anyway and they just</p>
<p>now they think they can so they are so there&rsquo;s probably a little bit of that that&rsquo;s just adding</p>
<p>to it do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of extra innovation that&rsquo;s still possible like what yeah</p>
<p>if you could do this kind of big leap uh with a little innovation of foam is there other stuff</p>
<p>that you can do or further innovation materials that make up the foam yeah so they can definitely</p>
<p>go much more advantage they put a cap on it essentially so there was a there&rsquo;s also a carbon</p>
<p>plate element to this too where they put like this carbon plate in there in between the foam</p>
<p>so like i believe when when kipchiki broke well when they did that that kind of uh uh the sub</p>
<p>two hour project he actually had on a shoe if i&rsquo;m not mistaken that never got to market because</p>
<p>they put down some parameters on it after uh before it that one came to market where it was</p>
<p>actually like stacked up to i can&rsquo;t remember how many millimeters it was an insane amount and they</p>
<p>had like i think maybe even three layer plates in there and that was a nike shoe he was wearing yeah</p>
<p>yeah so what makes it kind of controversial or difficult is nike came out with these prototypes</p>
<p>so a prototype for people don&rsquo;t understand shoes like these these companies they&rsquo;ll develop a shoe</p>
<p>and it usually takes like somewhere in the neighborhood of like probably 18 months to hit</p>
<p>the market so if you&rsquo;re like a sponsored athlete or work for the company you can get your hands</p>
<p>on these shoes before they actually come to market so we had an issue i think this wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily as big of an issue in the ultra running community but uh in the track and field olympic</p>
<p>distance stuff was a big issue because you had nike athletes having these prototype shoes before</p>
<p>anyone could get them and then you had athletes were sponsored by these other brands who couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wear them even if even when they did come to market so then we had this like chase to catch up</p>
<p>where uh other companies are starting to make their own version of it and now we&rsquo;re getting to</p>
<p>a point where most companies have a version of that shoe um but we had a huge transition phase</p>
<p>that impacted the olympics big time i mean think of here here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s an example of it uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a there was a an athlete cara goucher um she was not she was a nike athlete wasn&rsquo;t uh when they</p>
<p>came out with this shoe and she ran the olympic trial marathon and got fourth place the first</p>
<p>person out and uh two of the people had ever had that shoe on and she was maybe a minute or two like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have to look to see exactly but it was within the the performance advantage range and so you</p>
<p>could argue that she was the first person in modern running to lose an olympic spot due to</p>
<p>a technological disadvantage wow and and it&rsquo;s like i mean it&rsquo;s one of those yeah i mean it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things where like um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a transition right so there&rsquo;s gonna be bumpy road and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people that get caught in that transition that it&rsquo;s unfortunate for but it&rsquo;s also like uh</p>
<p>you know once everything does catch up and every shoe company has a version of this there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>problems i mean these are incredibly expensive shoes it&rsquo;s like a 250 shoe so it&rsquo;s like at what</p>
<p>point do you tell like a wealthy family with a high school kid that you know you can get that</p>
<p>250 shoe but then you go and this kid&rsquo;s family can barely afford a pair of shoes for them much</p>
<p>less a 250 parachute like where do we draw that line and that sort of stuff um also just here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the other big one like let&rsquo;s i mean two to eight percent is a massive range what if you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>two percent versus someone&rsquo;s on the eight percent you know chances are if you&rsquo;re you know blowing</p>
<p>a record out of the water you&rsquo;re probably closer to that high end percentage versus someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe getting incremental gains you&rsquo;re probably closer to that lower end so is it fair to have</p>
<p>a piece of equipment that has that big of a range when we&rsquo;re talking about less than a percent</p>
<p>determining these races when all is held constant those are fascinating like philosophical questions</p>
<p>that i think it&rsquo;s nice to solve that for the shoe or to raise those questions for a shoe</p>
<p>because the more complicated place where they will be raised is probably like genetics</p>
<p>genetic engineering all those kinds of things yeah it&rsquo;ll get a lot more complicated so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nice when you have like a particular piece of technology that&rsquo;s just like right there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a shoe we can understand it we can study it right we may be coming on the precipice of like</p>
<p>human powered sport performance is no longer being something that we like look at as this</p>
<p>like pinnacle of uh like i guess i don&rsquo;t maybe entertainment&rsquo;s the wrong word but like is that</p>
<p>a pursuit you know do we end up just going a different direction i mean i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard for us to think about that right now because it&rsquo;s so part of like the culture</p>
<p>and the lifestyle of the average person where like sport is a hobby of theirs as well as a</p>
<p>passion to follow and it&rsquo;s like how complicated does it need to get before people lose that</p>
<p>interest and and there could be a future where most of the olympics is esports somebody told me</p>
<p>that esports is in the olympics i&rsquo;ve been meaning to look this up which is you know like what video</p>
<p>so video games are in the olympics yeah yeah it could be as like a trial that they&rsquo;re doing um</p>
<p>yeah if this is true i&rsquo;m trying in real time look it up but if this esports joining olympics in 2024</p>
<p>wow so that could be just a that could be a fun side thing but it could be a first step into a</p>
<p>complete transformation what sports mean yeah because you can control video games better than</p>
<p>you control for genetics and humans well and in reality we&rsquo;ve been dealing with this problem in</p>
<p>other areas just with the performance enhancing side of things with drugs and all that stuff too</p>
<p>and anyway that that conversation&rsquo;s flared back up with track and field too where we are seeing a lot</p>
<p>of records get broken a lot of it probably is to shoot technology but you know in 2020 with the</p>
<p>covid stuff you have all these out of competition testing protocols that a lot of these top tier</p>
<p>olympic athletes are getting uh to try to eliminate like if you just do inter competition</p>
<p>testing like there&rsquo;s potential for people to do things that are uh going to give them a</p>
<p>performance advantage but not going to show up on that test on the day of or after their race where</p>
<p>now you have these like limitations of being able to test so do we have a like a group of athletes</p>
<p>now who decide oh i&rsquo;m not going to get tested in 2020 do the covid restrictions this is the time</p>
<p>to dope up and then you know hit some stride and some records and then you taper back off when they</p>
<p>get this thing fired back up again and so there may be some of that as well and i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always been an ongoing problem and yeah so the boost you get from performance enhancing drugs</p>
<p>could be tying you relative to the stuff we have in the future right yeah so you might be the last</p>
<p>generation of like natural unmodified humans that were running and who knows maybe that&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>over who knows who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s modified that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s true you might we might be living through</p>
<p>that transition to the new nike shoe but broadly defined yeah so you&rsquo;ll be uh in some sense in in</p>
<p>the history books as uh humans used to run without any modifications they used to destroy their body</p>
<p>and let it recover and then do it again and they used to be impressed with a with an 11 hour</p>
<p>an 100 mile time when we could do it in under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but nevertheless it</p>
<p>is incredible the four mile the four minute mile was incredibly impressive uh the i really love</p>
<p>the 11 hour mark for the 100 miler and the two hour marathon by most people um for the longest</p>
<p>time will start to be impossible you know there&rsquo;s still people that think it&rsquo;s impossible with under</p>
<p>certain constraints so uh uh eliot kipchoge of kenya as you mentioned ran a one hour 59 minute</p>
<p>40 second marathon but he had like you said the prototype shoes and he had the the the pace</p>
<p>setters yeah i don&rsquo;t know how essential that is but it seems quite essential do you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible first of all what do you think about that accomplishment uh and he is one of the greatest if</p>
<p>not the greatest marathon runners of all time what do you think about that accomplishment and</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to run a two hour marathon without any assistance yeah i mean</p>
<p>i think yeah there&rsquo;s no question about it regardless of technology he&rsquo;s world class if</p>
<p>not the best um the i think he i think he could go under two or someone equivalent to him could</p>
<p>go under two hours with with the shoe technology probably what it&rsquo;ll take is it&rsquo;ll take a fast</p>
<p>course a course that has like very few tangents because like you know turning on a course they</p>
<p>estimate adds about a percent to the to the distance so you know when we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a marathon you&rsquo;re getting up to like a quarter mile extra running you know that alone could</p>
<p>potentially put you down near near too flat based on what you know we&rsquo;re seeing because i mean</p>
<p>kip jaggi he&rsquo;s got a was it 201 40 i believe is his actual world record where it&rsquo;s actually like</p>
<p>you know certified so i mean he&rsquo;s right on the door knocking knocking on the door there um yeah</p>
<p>the prototype he had since then they put in a regulation where you can&rsquo;t stack a shoe for the</p>
<p>roads more than 40 millimeters so you can only have so much of that energy returning foam and</p>
<p>you can only have i think one carbon plate in there now uh so that puts a little bit of a</p>
<p>ceiling on that technological thing uh but but who knows what else will come out that and and</p>
<p>and to be honest who comes out with it because the fact that nike came out with this technology</p>
<p>is the reason why it&rsquo;s being allowed to be used if that would have been like you know another</p>
<p>running company that that came out with it i&rsquo;m sure the the regulations would have been slapped</p>
<p>down on it immediately and they would have probably just thrown it out all together would</p>
<p>have been this politics yeah oh yeah well and i mean it&rsquo;s it you can go you can go super like</p>
<p>you know negative with that and say like hey like this is like this is terrible or this is like super</p>
<p>nefarious when in reality it&rsquo;s like you know you have a company that has you know billions of</p>
<p>dollars and is interested enough in the sport that otherwise doesn&rsquo;t generate a ton of revenue</p>
<p>to you know pick up a big tab and support like uh you know track and field and things like that but</p>
<p>you know with that you know you you want to be the guy who says yeah thanks for the millions</p>
<p>and millions of dollars but we&rsquo;re gonna all those years and money you spent on that phone</p>
<p>yeah you wasted it we&rsquo;re not gonna let you use it but you know if you&rsquo;re another company who uh</p>
<p>you know revolutionizes the sport in potentially a negative way uh you know maybe maybe you say no</p>
<p>to them so it gets interesting that&rsquo;s the way that&rsquo;s how it always happens yeah yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really no way around i think phil mephiton i think it&rsquo;s him that he wrote a book about a</p>
<p>two hour marathon what are the limits how fast could we run and i think he puts it like an hour</p>
<p>and 42 minutes something like that or 40 something minutes it&rsquo;s kind of interesting question uh of</p>
<p>what are the limits uh do you think do you think we&rsquo;ll just keep pushing the limits of what humans</p>
<p>are capable of in the ultras in the marathon is this just like the way yeah the uh the way of</p>
<p>sport i think ultra for sure because that is a vastly growing sport and it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for much bigger popular much pool bigger pool of like talent to pull from</p>
<p>uh that could really push the needle down on some of these performances and things like that</p>
<p>uh especially as it becomes more popular if if people start realizing or i shouldn&rsquo;t say realizing</p>
<p>but if a scenario happens where like oh i&rsquo;m one of the best endurance athletes in the world i make</p>
<p>more money running ultra marathons than i do running the marathon then you know all of a</p>
<p>sudden we see every record get broken in a matter of a couple of years uh but the the for the marathon</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s gonna get faster i think but like to what degree is so hard to know it&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>know and the one hour and 40 minutes seems like that&rsquo;s pretty fast yes that&rsquo;s very fast i mean</p>
<p>for folks for some perspective there the current world record is like in the 440s per mile per mile</p>
<p>like just to add a little flavor to that you&rsquo;re basically sprinting yeah i mean go out to a track</p>
<p>and run one lap as fast as you can and then reflect on what time you get and realize like</p>
<p>the world record for the marathon is that is that lap at just over 70 seconds per lap so a minute</p>
<p>and 10 just over that but you&rsquo;re doing it 26.2 miles so so over a hundred times it&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>
<p>but watching elliot kipchoge just first of all he was like smiling at the end of it so the there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an extreme efficiency here too so he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s able to just find the right way to maximize yeah</p>
<p>maximize efficiency it makes it look easy i mean that that&rsquo;s true for basically every olympic</p>
<p>athlete when you watch gymnasts they kind of make it look easy yeah but there&rsquo;s like tens if not</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of hours behind that training yeah just to be comfortable enough to even attempt</p>
<p>some of the moves they do in gymnastics is mind boggling that one is super awesome because uh</p>
<p>how tragic it is like one little slip up yeah four years of work and your route it&rsquo;s all gone</p>
<p>not just four years of work for many of them a lifetime a lifetime of work and they&rsquo;re teenagers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re teenagers and they get dedicated everything to it that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what makes the</p>
<p>pursuits of humans so fascinating we kind of talked about this a little bit already but</p>
<p>is there something that stands out to you as one of the hardest things you&rsquo;ve had to overcome</p>
<p>in all the either training or the competing that you&rsquo;ve done has there been moments that</p>
<p>kind of stand out where you&rsquo;re proud of yourself that that you were truly tested and you overcame</p>
<p>it i think i&rsquo;d be more inclined just because it stands out to me much bigger than any one like</p>
<p>hard decision or outcome i had from a particular race is just like the trajectory of like you know</p>
<p>doing what i&rsquo;m doing now is so much different from what i would have ever expected uh you know</p>
<p>i mean i was a talented enough runner where i could make the state meet by my senior year at a</p>
<p>small division three school and you know compete at a division three college and be pretty modest</p>
<p>talent comparative to my to my peers at the top level of division three to think that like i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>doing anything that was revolved around running as as an occupation is is uh i still second guess</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s actually occurring makes me wonder about the whole simulation theory thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got my joystick and exactly uh but they got cheat codes yeah exactly yeah because i mean i</p>
<p>went to school to be a teacher and i really loved that profession i taught for about five years and</p>
<p>then i got to a point where you know some of it&rsquo;s just perfect timing too like the sport gained</p>
<p>enough popularity where there&rsquo;s enough money in it where like i could start a coaching business i</p>
<p>could get sponsorships and things like that and actually look at it and say financially i can make</p>
<p>a go of this or at least risk it but there&rsquo;s such a fine line between like deciding to do that or</p>
<p>kind of staying comfortable because uh i mean i was at the perfect teaching spot for me i was at</p>
<p>this uh like project based learning school and just outside of madison wisconsin loved it um one</p>
<p>of the hardest decisions my life to make was to step away from that to pursue running and more</p>
<p>holistically um and i mean i almost didn&rsquo;t i had a co teacher who was uh i was thinking myself i</p>
<p>knew that was like a decision i was gonna have to make the next few years but it was such an easy</p>
<p>decision to say well wait one more year and he was just like he was a little more of a free spirit</p>
<p>than i was certainly at the time he&rsquo;s like dude what are you waiting for just go why are you here</p>
<p>like like after i told him that he like every time we&rsquo;d we&rsquo;d i&rsquo;d come into i&rsquo;d come into school the</p>
<p>next day and he&rsquo;d be like why are you still here but i mean that was there&rsquo;s a tongue in cheek for</p>
<p>sure but uh but it&rsquo;s hard to know that you&rsquo;re going to be successful right in that kind of</p>
<p>leap given your like you know because it&rsquo;s easier when you&rsquo;re like an ultra performer early on but</p>
<p>to have the faith that you can accomplish something in some regards it&rsquo;s a blessing in the sense that</p>
<p>like uh you know failing would have been fairly predictable right whereas if like you know i always</p>
<p>wonder i mean i think of these like especially the big sports like baseball football and basketball</p>
<p>and you get you know guys who guys and girls who are like identified in like early high school as</p>
<p>being the next and it&rsquo;s like what kind of pressure is that to think like well if i&rsquo;m not like literally</p>
<p>one of the best players in the nba in 10 years i failed yeah it&rsquo;s just mind boggling to think if</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not one of the best at one of the most competitive sports on the planet in what is an</p>
<p>athletic i think an athletic state of an nba basketball player is probably one of the most</p>
<p>athletic human beings on the planet and to know like at in a teenage year that your your your</p>
<p>your success bar is being the best one of the best in the league or the best ever and that</p>
<p>conversation is floating around everywhere you look and see versus being able to kind of quietly</p>
<p>fail and go back to teaching this makes it a little more digestible i think you have a little</p>
<p>bit of more freedom to be great right nobody&rsquo;s expecting you to be right uh is there from that</p>
<p>is there advice you can give to young people today high schoolers college students taking on</p>
<p>trying to figure out their career trying to figure out their life advice on how to succeed in either</p>
<p>yeah i think uh you know one thing i was always interested when i was teaching was like you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have these you&rsquo;d have students who had like interests they had what they were good at and</p>
<p>sometimes those ran in in unison with one another other times they didn&rsquo;t and it was always</p>
<p>interesting to me when you&rsquo;d have a student who&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m really into like you know guitar or i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really into skateboarding or something like that where it&rsquo;s like pretty small like success rate on</p>
<p>that avenue versus what you could maybe accomplish by focusing on just something like a little more</p>
<p>standard and i think like really like besides the likelihood of it becoming something you can turn</p>
<p>into a profession or not you should just ask yourself like is this something that i want to</p>
<p>spend my free time doing uh and because if it is then you want to keep that in your life because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s rewarding motivating it might be the catalyst that gets you out of</p>
<p>bed in the morning and you know go to another job in order to go do that thing afterwards and i think</p>
<p>nowadays we&rsquo;re getting to a point where like the your reach ability from even a really small like</p>
<p>unmonetized thing previously is now an option where if like you live in a city where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only two other people interested in your topic of area so you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to turn into a</p>
<p>job now with the internet you have the world at your disposal so that two to three people in every</p>
<p>town can turn into thousands tens of thousands hundreds of millions of people and if you</p>
<p>really focus your time and energy into that thing then you know who knows where you can go and how</p>
<p>much more enjoyable your life can be if you&rsquo;re able to turn your career into a passion of yours</p>
<p>so i think like that is something i would tell tell people um focus on that see the thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good at and you kind of sparks that flame and uh go with that even if society doesn&rsquo;t really want</p>
<p>you to uh like it&rsquo;s non traditional uh and the odds are low of like traditionally defined success</p>
<p>just do that thing i&rsquo;ve struggled with that it&rsquo;s like it was always clear especially like in school</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff i&rsquo;m actually good at and stuff that the world wants me to do right yeah and i kept</p>
<p>doing the world wanted me to be a plumber when i took that test my sophomore year but even like</p>
<p>like academically just going to university and uh academia there&rsquo;s certain ways even in in i would</p>
<p>say even in the thing you want to do the way you do that thing the world will want you to do in a</p>
<p>certain way and even just like finding your way of doing that thing is uh is really powerful like</p>
<p>for me the way i do research the way i learn is is different than colleagues of mine and i realized</p>
<p>i realized that that i really like to follow things i&rsquo;m passionate about versus sort of the</p>
<p>rigor of studying every like the fundamentals all across the board and building up in castle</p>
<p>um on the fundamentals like layer upon layer just there&rsquo;s a bunch of details in the way i</p>
<p>pursue the very thing that i currently do that&rsquo;s different than others and it took me quite a long</p>
<p>time to accept like you don&rsquo;t need to do it the way everyone else is doing it doesn&rsquo;t not everyone</p>
<p>else but the majority of people are telling you to do it because one is beneficial to do it</p>
<p>different because then you&rsquo;ll more likely stand out and two like why the hell are you doing it</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s not working for you yeah yeah you know i saw that all the time when i was teaching</p>
<p>i was dual certified i was my my certifications were in history and broadfield social studies so</p>
<p>like econ uh psychology history all that stuff and then i also had a certification of special</p>
<p>education which was you know people think of special education a lot of times as like oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the you know the kid who is not smart enough to do the regular thing when reality it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean there is some you know there&rsquo;s obviously like you know like certain things like down</p>
<p>syndrome and stuff like that but like there&rsquo;s also like a huge population of groups of both</p>
<p>like gifted and talented on one end of the spectrum where they&rsquo;re incredibly smart and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like the geniuses but for whatever reason the standard method of learning does not click</p>
<p>with them does not work with them and then they just need a slightly different path or maybe</p>
<p>a drastically different path and they&rsquo;re gonna just flourish and you have kids that end up</p>
<p>falling on the other end where you know maybe it&rsquo;s really difficult for them to be able to read at</p>
<p>the speed of other students but if you give them this specific direction they can just thrive in</p>
<p>a certain area and just seeing that like the you know like that there&rsquo;s multiple ways to do stuff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not necessarily one path to the end is i think such an eye opening thing to learn</p>
<p>especially if you learn maybe that&rsquo;s what i should answer the question that you asked me with is you</p>
<p>know keep an open mind as to what paths are forward and know that you know maybe just because</p>
<p>even if you look to your left you know to the right and all your classmates are successful</p>
<p>doing it one way it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that&rsquo;s going to be the way for you</p>
<p>yeah so that could lend you in eating a meat based diet running across the country</p>
<p>uh like the the incredible madman that you are zack i&rsquo;m a huge fan as i told you many times you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>an inspiration to many i&rsquo;ll be there checking in every day if you somehow make it out the starting</p>
<p>line on september 1st i know i know joe rogan and millions of others will be as well so i&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>to see all the suffering that you&rsquo;re going to go through i wish you the best of luck and</p>
<p>thank you so much for talking today i really really appreciate it well thanks a bunch of</p>
<p>likes it&rsquo;s been a an honor to come on your podcast i&rsquo;ve been a fan of it for uh 10 years</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been a fan of it for uh for quite some time and um i thought about wearing a white suit but</p>
<p>michael malice already took care of that one so it was well and uh i think it&rsquo;ll be really good</p>
<p>for the ratings of this conversation if you end up dying during that run so i&rsquo;ll do my best so</p>
<p>the everything that could happen will be positive for for the world you&rsquo;re saying i should try to</p>
<p>average 100 miles a day 100 miles well i think you&rsquo;re going to push yourself to again it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a priority but it&rsquo;s trying to beat that record that&rsquo;s probably going to take everything you have</p>
<p>and that that that&rsquo;s truly inspiring i wish you the best of luck man thanks a bunch thanks for</p>
<p>listening to this conversation with zac bitter and thank you to ladder belcampo noom and better help</p>
<p>check them out in the description to support this podcast and now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>steve prefontaine i&rsquo;m going to work so that&rsquo;s a pure guts race at the end and if it is i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>only one who can win it thank you for listening and hope to see you next time</p>
