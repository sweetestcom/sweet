<p>so ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>a fucking trainer yesterday got killed by an orca</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about that shit no you didn&rsquo;t hear about that</p>
<p>killer whale killed a trainer at seaworld</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s amazing to me is</p>
<p>how they haven&rsquo;t been killing people up to this point</p>
<p>could you imagine if</p>
<p>whales killer whales are supposed to be</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re like as</p>
<p>intelligent as humans they&rsquo;re cousins of dolphins</p>
<p>and we put him in a fucking fish tank</p>
<p>and make him do</p>
<p>tricks for mackerels</p>
<p>you know can you imagine what kind of hell that life is</p>
<p>when this whale</p>
<p>had killed a homeless man</p>
<p>that snuck into the fucking tank in nineteen ninety one</p>
<p>and he had also</p>
<p>or it might be a she i&rsquo;m not sure he or she</p>
<p>had also i think it&rsquo;s a he</p>
<p>had also almost drowned a trainer</p>
<p>remember that video</p>
<p>where the killer whale was playing with the person</p>
<p>dunking them under</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>in that same way</p>
<p>wow same way</p>
<p>yeah so i mean it&rsquo;s not like the warning fucking signs</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>you know you hear mike tyson</p>
<p>punch somebody</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t be shocked</p>
<p>what happens</p>
<p>like how do you die</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s a woman that died</p>
<p>he grabbed her by the</p>
<p>waist and just fucking ripped her up</p>
<p>in the middle of a live show</p>
<p>yep the beginning of the</p>
<p>live show where&rsquo;s the youtube videos is it out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question i bet they</p>
<p>confiscated everybody&rsquo;s cameras</p>
<p>as they were leaving yeah but you know</p>
<p>the sd cards are so</p>
<p>small you think you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>learn to shove it up your ass or something this guy</p>
<p>if he was there for sure</p>
<p>there would be a</p>
<p>video of it</p>
<p>one fucking thousand percent yeah as soon as i</p>
<p>heard we need everybody&rsquo;s cameras</p>
<p>sd card up ass</p>
<p>save to you</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>uploaded to youtube already yeah that</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>bluetooth to</p>
<p>you stream yeah there&rsquo;s no fucking way i mean</p>
<p>could you imagine what that</p>
<p>must have looked like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re there and all of a sudden the killer he</p>
<p>grabbed her</p>
<p>about the waist</p>
<p>and just started</p>
<p>smashing her back and forth just ragdolling her</p>
<p>he just had enough he just said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s it motherfuckers you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really incredible that we</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s cool to do that and then we go and</p>
<p>watch them you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like zoos bum me the fuck out</p>
<p>we went to a zoo in</p>
<p>australia while we&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and there was a cool part of it was the crocodile cage</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t think that crocodile gives a fuck</p>
<p>where it is i think crocodiles are so dumb</p>
<p>i mean they seem</p>
<p>their mind seems so dead they just</p>
<p>lay there with their eyes closed</p>
<p>underwater for like</p>
<p>hours at a time but they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to breathe they don&rsquo;t have to breathe for like an hour</p>
<p>so they just lay underwater</p>
<p>and just do nothing and just sit there they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>run around and play like when you pass like the</p>
<p>monkey cage at a zoo</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s depressing</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be there when i was in denver</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a zoo in denver and the</p>
<p>monkey got in his fucking cage and was howling</p>
<p>this horrible howl</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t a big cage</p>
<p>this monkey was</p>
<p>screaming out like a tortured</p>
<p>soul it was like a man in prison</p>
<p>you know let me out of here</p>
<p>the monkey was just wow</p>
<p>just screaming at the top of his</p>
<p>lungs and i was like yo this is not good</p>
<p>like this is not cool to do that</p>
<p>for what so people can stare at them</p>
<p>i mean that shit</p>
<p>might have flown in the</p>
<p>nineteen thirties you know back when there was no zoos</p>
<p>or back when there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>videos but we have</p>
<p>videos now man you don&rsquo;t have to put them in a zoo</p>
<p>you know but that&rsquo;s the only time we</p>
<p>would ever be able to see most of</p>
<p>those animals that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that makes me go well i see the reason for a zoo</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to africa and hunting down a white</p>
<p>tiger you know</p>
<p>right but is it</p>
<p>worth it for them to struggle just so you</p>
<p>could stare at them</p>
<p>yeah but you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it could also be like</p>
<p>dude wait i don&rsquo;t have to hunt my food there&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>steak here every morning when i wake up</p>
<p>i could sleep no you know no for like tigers</p>
<p>that shit is orgasmic</p>
<p>to chase down an animal</p>
<p>chase it move it</p>
<p>you ever see a cat like if you roll a ball string in</p>
<p>front of them they can&rsquo;t help themselves man you</p>
<p>should know that you have cats right</p>
<p>cats can&rsquo;t help it</p>
<p>they live for chasing shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>like you know a guy with a hard dick lives to fuck</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s really the same thing man</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s nature rewards</p>
<p>them for being a good predator and i think</p>
<p>you know the way same way food</p>
<p>tastes good for us and sex feels good for us</p>
<p>they love to kill man nature</p>
<p>rewards them with some</p>
<p>crazy rush of energy</p>
<p>and endorphins when they kill something</p>
<p>you know so you give them a cold</p>
<p>plate of meat</p>
<p>just push an aluminum tray</p>
<p>under the fucking cage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the same and that&rsquo;s not fun guaranteed</p>
<p>you know but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>the killing thing</p>
<p>bothers me but</p>
<p>what really bothers me is the fucking amount of</p>
<p>room that they have to move around</p>
<p>the kangaroo cable</p>
<p>la zoo definite</p>
<p>the kangaroo</p>
<p>cage was fucked up have you ever been to the</p>
<p>san diego zoo though that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole i mean yeah</p>
<p>when i was there i was like man i</p>
<p>would like to be an animal in this cage</p>
<p>oh no we went down</p>
<p>this serious fucking</p>
<p>delay between what we&rsquo;re saying or what we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that it we got it okay um</p>
<p>yeah san diego is the shit</p>
<p>the way they have it is nice they have a big giant ass</p>
<p>place that that makes</p>
<p>sense but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking expensive</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>should be the</p>
<p>places like the la zoo just shouldn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>wrong you go</p>
<p>to the la zoo that&rsquo;s just depressing as fuck</p>
<p>but there is like the columbus zoo</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>is one of the biggest zoos jack hannah&rsquo;s from it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nice they may have just</p>
<p>acres and acres and acres of land and they</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know if they</p>
<p>maybe throw out some goats once in a</p>
<p>while for the</p>
<p>tigers or something</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t ever do that they do that in iraq this</p>
<p>video in iraq of</p>
<p>they let a donkey loose</p>
<p>and this is how they do it every day</p>
<p>and the donkeys just walking</p>
<p>around eating and they open up the gate and these</p>
<p>tigers come running out of the gate and just</p>
<p>bitch slap that donkey</p>
<p>to the ground and fucking jack them it&rsquo;s really kind of</p>
<p>wild to see</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>shocking these gis filmed it</p>
<p>when they were in iraq at the zoo</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s shocking to see but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the way they&rsquo;re supposed to eat</p>
<p>like though that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>should do it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna feed animals you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have wild animals you</p>
<p>should have them eat what they normal eat man</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s with this</p>
<p>feeding fucking</p>
<p>snakes frozen mice give them a fucking</p>
<p>mouse you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re supposed to do</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to like</p>
<p>enforce our</p>
<p>own ideas of morality and predation on fucking monsters</p>
<p>you know i mean like look a</p>
<p>snake is a monster dude you know</p>
<p>tigers that&rsquo;s a monster</p>
<p>those are all monsters</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re natural</p>
<p>monsters they</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole natural</p>
<p>cycle of things and</p>
<p>to take them out of that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there was a kangaroo cage that was the most depressing</p>
<p>thing because</p>
<p>those kangaroos are just sitting there</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t do shit they just laid there</p>
<p>human beings though</p>
<p>could be considered</p>
<p>monsters so like</p>
<p>if you put somebody in prison that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mass murderer we&rsquo;re doing the same</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>we should let that mass murder go out on</p>
<p>his way and just murder a shitload of people you know</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>dumbass logic is that</p>
<p>well i mean if you&rsquo;re saying like</p>
<p>you know like a</p>
<p>tiger&rsquo;s a tiger or whatever in like a</p>
<p>snake should kill its own prey and we should</p>
<p>you know do it what</p>
<p>well what no we&rsquo;re feeding them</p>
<p>killed prey we kill it</p>
<p>first that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>ridiculous thing</p>
<p>is that we kill what they</p>
<p>they eat first</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not as brutal for us</p>
<p>somehow or another</p>
<p>someone else kills it you buy it killed then you</p>
<p>feed it to them that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a mass murderer</p>
<p>dude mass murderers are just fucked in the head</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not killing for food it&rsquo;s a part of a natural</p>
<p>cycle they&rsquo;re just nuts</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>and then when you get a nutty person the problem is</p>
<p>human consciousness is so more complex</p>
<p>supposedly than animal</p>
<p>consciousness because we have the ability to alter</p>
<p>our environment so you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>someone whose consciousness is haywire</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you have like serial killers mass murders</p>
<p>what you have is someone whose consciousness is just</p>
<p>gone off the</p>
<p>tracks and into the woods and you have just chaos and</p>
<p>if a society is</p>
<p>aware of itself</p>
<p>it has to realize that there&rsquo;s certain issues are</p>
<p>gonna come up when you have</p>
<p>crazy people running around killing your family</p>
<p>and your friends</p>
<p>so you gotta kill them what you&rsquo;re supposed to do with</p>
<p>someone like a mass murderer if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely convinced</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem really the problem is the court</p>
<p>system the court</p>
<p>system so fucking corrupt and</p>
<p>so many times</p>
<p>das and prosecutors</p>
<p>are just trying to get</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just kind of trying to get</p>
<p>a guilty verdict and they don&rsquo;t give a fuck if someone</p>
<p>is guilty or not there&rsquo;s many many many instances</p>
<p>where cops are framed guys</p>
<p>that were innocent</p>
<p>people have gone to jail for years</p>
<p>it turns out through dna evidence they were framed</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s happened many many many</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real fucking problem</p>
<p>but if we could be</p>
<p>absolutely sure</p>
<p>that we knew that somebody was a mass murderer</p>
<p>or a rapist or</p>
<p>anyone with no remorse who hurt</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>and could hurt someone that you care you</p>
<p>gotta kill them</p>
<p>why why keep around</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many fucking people</p>
<p>you know i mean look it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna die eventually</p>
<p>anyway it&rsquo;s not like if you don&rsquo;t kill them</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>cure cancer and live forever no they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do anything they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>a mass murderer is not</p>
<p>gonna contribute to society you know they&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing is</p>
<p>gonna nothing good is</p>
<p>gonna come out of that they</p>
<p>should just line them up and like oh you need a new</p>
<p>liver bam you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>death row there</p>
<p>should be no like</p>
<p>you know time period and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna electrocute you</p>
<p>they should just</p>
<p>shoot you take all the parts that they</p>
<p>think they could use your corneas or that your</p>
<p>livers yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting</p>
<p>topic because there was a threat on the</p>
<p>board the message board</p>
<p>on my website</p>
<p>where people were talking about</p>
<p>organs having a memory and</p>
<p>all these people who</p>
<p>have gotten</p>
<p>transplants from people all of a</p>
<p>sudden they knew</p>
<p>things that couldn&rsquo;t have possibly</p>
<p>had dreams of</p>
<p>people they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>you know stuff like that yeah</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard of many</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>where people all of a</p>
<p>sudden had cravings for</p>
<p>certain types of foods and they had no idea that the</p>
<p>i mean this is not just one instance</p>
<p>and see the thing is</p>
<p>about memory like we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where memory is stored exactly</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>they know an incredible amount</p>
<p>more than the average person</p>
<p>about the way the</p>
<p>human body works</p>
<p>much more than</p>
<p>people knew a hundred years ago much more than</p>
<p>you know even a decade ago</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>everything there&rsquo;s a lot of questions man</p>
<p>first of all with</p>
<p>human body your cells regenerate</p>
<p>every seven to ten i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s seven years</p>
<p>so literally</p>
<p>every cell in your body</p>
<p>changes and becomes a new one</p>
<p>like you are you&rsquo;re a new version of you</p>
<p>every seven to ten years that there</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not the same anymore</p>
<p>so if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>where the fuck are your memories</p>
<p>because i have memories that are way more than</p>
<p>seven years old</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>where the memory stored if you have a</p>
<p>completely new cell i mean</p>
<p>are the memories like</p>
<p>transferred</p>
<p>back and forth</p>
<p>between the cells when the new one is born</p>
<p>is it born with the same memories i mean</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the memory</p>
<p>where is it stored we don&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>the other idea is that the memories are stored in the</p>
<p>neurons well if that&rsquo;s the case because the</p>
<p>neurons are the only</p>
<p>thing that stay</p>
<p>the neurons are not you get</p>
<p>the neurons you get or the</p>
<p>neurons you get forever</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get new ones</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t regenerate</p>
<p>every seven years</p>
<p>but the heart is filled with neurons</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one of the biggest clusters of</p>
<p>neurons in the body it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>right up there with the brain</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>people who have had heart</p>
<p>transplants</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that preposterous that they</p>
<p>would have memories i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>is that preposterous at all</p>
<p>i think it is</p>
<p>and i think that</p>
<p>these people that say that they&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>dreams stuff they probably</p>
<p>would have had that same</p>
<p>exact dream</p>
<p>with or without it why</p>
<p>would you say that</p>
<p>brian they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about things they couldn&rsquo;t possibly have</p>
<p>known about</p>
<p>people have this little have you had</p>
<p>dreams this little</p>
<p>girl gave up the</p>
<p>exact identity</p>
<p>and location of the woman who</p>
<p>of the man who murdered</p>
<p>the girl who gave her the heart</p>
<p>do you know that story</p>
<p>no but it sounded it</p>
<p>sounds perfect</p>
<p>it sounds far</p>
<p>fetched but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>things that i read that</p>
<p>like that that it&rsquo;s kind of like to me</p>
<p>is seeing ufos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either somebody</p>
<p>that wants attention that&rsquo;s possible that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>dumb and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going no i had my arm</p>
<p>transplant and now i can i</p>
<p>think having all these</p>
<p>dreams of people i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s possible i know i know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>skepticism totally</p>
<p>with skepticism</p>
<p>when it comes to something that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that&rsquo;s the problems that you know</p>
<p>you run the possibility of it</p>
<p>excluding something because it seems irrational</p>
<p>but the reality is we don&rsquo;t have enough information</p>
<p>to decide what&rsquo;s rational and what&rsquo;s irrational</p>
<p>just the idea</p>
<p>that you have memories at all is fucking nuts</p>
<p>you know the idea that</p>
<p>you can how</p>
<p>about the idea</p>
<p>that you can change people&rsquo;s memories you know</p>
<p>they say that</p>
<p>especially like right</p>
<p>after something</p>
<p>shocking if you to</p>
<p>start talking to someone</p>
<p>and introducing new ideas to them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>re remember the</p>
<p>whole situation</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll change the</p>
<p>whole way they remember</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>have you ever thought of something was some way</p>
<p>and then you go back you watch the</p>
<p>video you like god</p>
<p>damn it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all like i had a fucking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t trust my</p>
<p>member that much i trust</p>
<p>some things</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>i know that are recorded in there forever for real</p>
<p>and no doubt about it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve made sure that i&rsquo;ve kept that memory</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>pretty intense</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>where i made sure like i am</p>
<p>gonna make sure that i record this one right</p>
<p>but other ones are fucking</p>
<p>blur man you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them that are blurry</p>
<p>you know you look back on your high</p>
<p>school years like</p>
<p>jesus christ it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>slideshows and</p>
<p>i barely remember any of it do you remember</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>worse and worse</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually pretty good with a lot of</p>
<p>weird memories but then</p>
<p>the other day i was trying to</p>
<p>think of somebody</p>
<p>and that i actually hung out with for</p>
<p>three years when i was a kid</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t remember his face at all</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even put like my</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t remember him we hung out all the time</p>
<p>like i remember him but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know have any idea what he looks</p>
<p>like yeah i&rsquo;ve had that happen to me before for sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>weird it is</p>
<p>weird it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird i wonder</p>
<p>where all that shit goes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been smoked</p>
<p>why is it that someone can pull it back though</p>
<p>like someone will say something you go yes</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden boom the memory like blossoms in your mind</p>
<p>like what is that is it like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>given cpr to the memories it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re almost dead</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like a branch of the tree was hit like</p>
<p>a nerve of that memory was</p>
<p>hit and it woke up that section of memory or whatever</p>
<p>yeah something</p>
<p>along those lines</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>what the fuck is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my phone</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>oh dude you got a spider on your face look oh shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a daddy long leg how the fuck did that get on</p>
<p>your house is a fear factor</p>

<p>dallas this weekend i&rsquo;m not in new york this weekend</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna be at the addison improv</p>
<p>this weekend</p>
<p>friday saturday and sunday</p>
<p>with my man joey diaz</p>
<p>and brian will be there as well if we get brian drunk</p>
<p>might have to talk him into going on stage</p>
<p>brian is actually a</p>
<p>funny comedian he&rsquo;s done stand up a couple of times</p>
<p>he did in atlanta he did it</p>
<p>what else did you</p>
<p>do you did a couple of</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>going to try to go up on</p>
<p>stage before this weekend just in case if i get too</p>
<p>drunk and put me on stage</p>
<p>but i really it really hurts me to go back and</p>
<p>spend three hours of my life for</p>
<p>like five minutes in front of two people yeah</p>
<p>the open mic nights</p>
<p>it is a grind you</p>
<p>know people ask me questions all the time like hey i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>doing comedy what&rsquo;s the best advice i&rsquo;m like man you</p>
<p>gotta be willing to put your</p>
<p>whole life aside</p>
<p>you gotta be willing to</p>
<p>you gotta be willing to</p>
<p>especially if you have a job during the day</p>
<p>you have a job during the day man your</p>
<p>nighttime you now that&rsquo;s your social life it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>stand up comedy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be going to clubs and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be performing</p>
<p>and you have</p>
<p>to do it all the time if you don&rsquo;t do it all the time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna forget all your material the</p>
<p>whatever comfort you gain on</p>
<p>stage will be</p>
<p>eroded very</p>
<p>quickly you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a goddamn long ass</p>
<p>grind man yeah i</p>
<p>think if i was younger i</p>
<p>would totally be into it but it&rsquo;s really hard to be an</p>
<p>adult and waste</p>
<p>that much time it is it is hard you know i did it i</p>
<p>started out doing</p>
<p>stand up when i was 21</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i did it</p>
<p>right after my 21st birthday</p>
<p>and i was had shit</p>
<p>going on back then man you know i mean i was doing</p>
<p>things i have you know i had a life</p>
<p>sort of but it wasn&rsquo;t like i had a family or a</p>
<p>mortgage or</p>
<p>you know no</p>
<p>obligations yeah i have no internet but</p>
<p>i had no obligations you know so it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard when you have a</p>
<p>girlfriend and you have a life and you have a wife</p>
<p>and you have children and you have mortgage fuck man</p>
<p>you know when i talk to dudes that are like forty</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about doing comedy i&rsquo;m like you know okay dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about getting into</p>
<p>brain surgery man</p>
<p>the thing about</p>
<p>brain surgery</p>
<p>not saying that comedy is as hard as</p>
<p>brain surgery</p>
<p>because first of all it&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as difficult to remember all the</p>
<p>things you need to remember with</p>
<p>brain surgeries but</p>
<p>it is just as difficult in a way because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real path i mean you</p>
<p>could suck as a comedian</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t suck as a</p>
<p>brain surgeon</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>going to jail</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s obviously a lot more discipline</p>
<p>involved in</p>
<p>brain surgery because you have to do it correctly but</p>
<p>both are equally</p>
<p>difficult to actually</p>
<p>fucking do and put</p>
<p>anything in this life is difficult if you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna really do it</p>
<p>i mean just think</p>
<p>about if you</p>
<p>started tomorrow</p>
<p>and you wanted</p>
<p>to be a computer programmer you don&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>about computers</p>
<p>you just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting from scratch</p>
<p>and you want to be a computer programmer fuck</p>
<p>imagine the fucking</p>
<p>work that&rsquo;s involved in that a lot of reading though</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a lot of reading nowadays like i mean</p>
<p>i could pretty much</p>
<p>teach myself</p>
<p>some programming</p>
<p>by just looking at videos</p>
<p>you know how to type you know</p>
<p>about computers</p>
<p>you know a lot of shit</p>
<p>about computers you know a lot of shit</p>
<p>about code you know to a person that has no</p>
<p>experience whatsoever and decides</p>
<p>i want to take on a</p>
<p>new career i want to be a computer programmer i want to</p>
<p>code for video games</p>
<p>good fucking luck man</p>
<p>how about i</p>
<p>wanna create</p>
<p>video game engines i just i don&rsquo;t know where i</p>
<p>wanna be the next john carmack you&rsquo;re fucked man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>that shit will take forever anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth doing</p>
<p>takes fucking forever to get good at</p>
<p>you know and comedy is no different comedy</p>
<p>music is no different</p>
<p>you know i often like look at people playing piano</p>
<p>or playing guitar or something like that</p>
<p>how cool would</p>
<p>that be to be able to just fucking jam on the guitar</p>
<p>but god damn that&rsquo;s a lot of fucking time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve tried to</p>
<p>learn that though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a coordination</p>
<p>thing for me though</p>
<p>with that that&rsquo;s something i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re just born with being able to</p>
<p>understand be</p>
<p>able to coordinate each finger a certain way</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>cultivation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also if you do</p>
<p>things like with your fingers like that</p>
<p>early on in life</p>
<p>you know it becomes much easier as you get older</p>
<p>they say that</p>
<p>the army now is</p>
<p>using they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using xbox controllers</p>
<p>for their drones</p>
<p>because these fucking kids are so</p>
<p>used to it yeah and they&rsquo;re encouraging people to play</p>
<p>video games and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before they</p>
<p>start recruiting like the baddest</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>in video games like yeah they probably</p>
<p>do yeah i mean like if you could play</p>
<p>like war games with like a keyboard and a mouse</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these dudes that play</p>
<p>quake like professionally</p>
<p>those motherfuckers</p>
<p>can move that</p>
<p>mouse cursor and put it on an</p>
<p>object like instantaneously</p>
<p>you know they know exactly</p>
<p>where that cursor is</p>
<p>going they play so much</p>
<p>that when they move that mouse</p>
<p>the mouse and the keyboard is way more accurate</p>
<p>than that joystick</p>
<p>thing the joystick</p>
<p>thing is kind of difficult</p>
<p>to manipulate</p>
<p>like the toggles and like</p>
<p>exactly where the</p>
<p>crosshair goes</p>
<p>but if you have a mouse</p>
<p>you can put a</p>
<p>mouse if you</p>
<p>understand like how quick</p>
<p>you know that all depends on you know</p>
<p>everybody likes a difference some people like high</p>
<p>sensitivity some people like low</p>
<p>sensitivity</p>
<p>but the bottom line is</p>
<p>once you get used to whatever it is you move the</p>
<p>mouse that the cursor goes in a certain directions</p>
<p>they can put it like exactly</p>
<p>where they want to instantly</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a helicopter and you see the insurgents you</p>
<p>gotta move the</p>
<p>crosshairs and get them in line we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been long we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been like no it&rsquo;s bang</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>could do it so fucking quick</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>would be some</p>
<p>crazy shit if you</p>
<p>could have drones</p>
<p>and i like that guy fatality</p>
<p>you know fatality is yeah yeah he&rsquo;s like the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucking</p>
<p>quake player ever</p>
<p>this dude is just</p>
<p>ridiculously accurate with his</p>
<p>mouth and a cool guy to him</p>
<p>very nice guy but</p>
<p>if you got that guy playing for your army and you had</p>
<p>drones with</p>
<p>missiles in it from that fucking guy holy shit</p>
<p>you know yeah that&rsquo;s the future man</p>
<p>welcome to the new world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy how video games have</p>
<p>exploded from something that used to be like</p>
<p>little ping pongs now people have amazing</p>
<p>video games on their</p>
<p>phones yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>man just look at what you can do with your iphone</p>
<p>playing all</p>
<p>these different racing games and shit</p>
<p>we what we working on the new ufc</p>
<p>fight game right</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s amazing man when you watch</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>graphics and shit like they dive for knee bars</p>
<p>they get triangles</p>
<p>they throw head kicks and</p>
<p>punches flying knees and shit</p>
<p>you see all this</p>
<p>crazy shit all</p>
<p>these different techniques they can do</p>
<p>just like in real fighting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so close</p>
<p>to being like a</p>
<p>video that you like an actual ufc</p>
<p>fight that you can manipulate</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>limit is in the controller i think</p>
<p>what eventually is</p>
<p>gonna happen is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a goddamn suit on</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a fucking suit on or you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna have this little wire</p>
<p>plugged in on your forehead and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna think</p>
<p>that could happen but microsoft is very</p>
<p>close to developing the</p>
<p>whole system</p>
<p>where you interact with</p>
<p>the game what&rsquo;s it called natel it comes out like i</p>
<p>think november or it</p>
<p>might have got pushed</p>
<p>spell it n a t a l</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty much just like a camera</p>
<p>or something that sits on top of your tv and then</p>
<p>it reads your emotions</p>
<p>read your motions</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s incredible because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be fucking cool</p>
<p>imagine having like a ufc game</p>
<p>where you could</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>fight without actually fighting</p>
<p>my problem with that</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>i think maybe if i was a kid i</p>
<p>would have loved it</p>
<p>but when i&rsquo;m playing a video game</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t want to have to be doing this shit</p>
<p>you know well you say that you say</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m doing it with wii right now</p>
<p>nintendo wii</p>
<p>right yeah but wii is</p>
<p>whack it&rsquo;s this little</p>
<p>thing and you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>ping pong and it sort of moves the way you want it to</p>
<p>i did a wii car</p>
<p>game once and i was like this is not specific at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not rewarding yeah but something</p>
<p>about having to like get up</p>
<p>like i wanna you&rsquo;re a lazy fuck no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what yeah if i was a kid it</p>
<p>might have been better but like nowadays i</p>
<p>wanna play a</p>
<p>video game i just wanna</p>
<p>sit there and</p>
<p>smoke weed but</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s dependent</p>
<p>on the graphics what if the graphics were like 3d</p>
<p>fucking super dope</p>
<p>virtual reality type shit</p>
<p>and you had</p>
<p>a virtual gun</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re running down a hallway</p>
<p>shooting at all kinds of shit</p>
<p>like you have a gun in your hand and it reads this gun</p>
<p>come on man that</p>
<p>would be the shit</p>
<p>and the actual running that you take</p>
<p>place like maybe</p>
<p>that would be the shit if you had a fucking</p>
<p>warehouse like a</p>
<p>virtual reality</p>
<p>warehouse like you</p>
<p>enter into the door</p>
<p>you put on this helmet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a flat out</p>
<p>laser tag yeah</p>
<p>but complete</p>
<p>3d virtual reality</p>
<p>you know yeah and if you get</p>
<p>close to the walls like a little</p>
<p>light goes on you are getting</p>
<p>close to the wall</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>the turn right</p>
<p>yeah yeah come on man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve just gotten to a point</p>
<p>where i did this nintendo wii shit just</p>
<p>drives me crazy</p>
<p>the wii is boring man</p>
<p>the wii is like playing pool</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no pool cue yeah you&rsquo;re just going like</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no feedback</p>
<p>you need feedback man</p>
<p>like i wanna</p>
<p>click a button</p>
<p>and see a gun go off you know i</p>
<p>wanna click the</p>
<p>mouse button and see the rocket you know take off</p>
<p>right that this whole</p>
<p>moving your arm through the air that&rsquo;s fucking weak</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i forget what it was they just said the</p>
<p>other day that</p>
<p>in the future</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna use like google maps</p>
<p>and like street view google maps and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be playing</p>
<p>video games of like your</p>
<p>street you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going around into your house</p>
<p>you know what i mean you</p>
<p>should be able</p>
<p>to find out if someone is playing like fucking</p>
<p>doom on your street and</p>
<p>blowing up your</p>
<p>house right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>hey just want you to know they</p>
<p>should like send you an email</p>
<p>it should be like the sims</p>
<p>whereas like your</p>
<p>house is the</p>
<p>house in the video game</p>
<p>and so like if you try to</p>
<p>break in your</p>
<p>house they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>break in your</p>
<p>house never mind</p>
<p>like everyone</p>
<p>should have their own</p>
<p>house in the</p>
<p>video game yeah that</p>
<p>would be kinda cool that</p>
<p>would be cool</p>
<p>right then you</p>
<p>would know where everybody everyone lives</p>
<p>unless you killed them</p>
<p>you show them in a</p>
<p>video game that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to</p>
<p>for like 24</p>
<p>hours or something like that and you can run away</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>shocked that</p>
<p>virtual reality kind of hit like a</p>
<p>the technology</p>
<p>never really developed the way i thought it was</p>
<p>going to like you know you heard</p>
<p>about that shit like</p>
<p>way back in the 80s and i thought wow like there was</p>
<p>movies based on that</p>
<p>and i was like i thought like wow</p>
<p>remember like</p>
<p>well sword dagger</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>what movie remember</p>
<p>total recall they fucking</p>
<p>make you could</p>
<p>dream right yeah</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s coming it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total recall what was the one with the</p>
<p>chick with the red hair and</p>
<p>not totally</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already been able to take images</p>
<p>and implant them in people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been able to read images</p>
<p>from people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>like read what you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about like you can look at something and the computer</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s some sort of</p>
<p>sensors that they hook up to your brain</p>
<p>and then it sends the</p>
<p>image to a computer and</p>
<p>it can tell what you&rsquo;re fucking looking at</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s nuts man</p>
<p>because eventually i mean this is in a very rudimentary</p>
<p>stages of technology</p>
<p>where they can only</p>
<p>pick out shapes and shit</p>
<p>but eventually they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to fucking see what you&rsquo;re seeing yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it is that one yeah</p>
<p>check out the red hair and fifth</p>
<p>is that the</p>
<p>bruce wallace</p>
<p>movie yeah and they had like memories like that</p>
<p>movies they</p>
<p>plugged like memories in your head that was</p>
<p>how badass was chris tucker in that</p>
<p>movie remember</p>
<p>he was that</p>
<p>crazy alien</p>
<p>remember lawnmower man</p>
<p>that was a good movie too</p>
<p>there was another nutty</p>
<p>movie about a retard that went</p>
<p>crazy right</p>
<p>right put a computer in his brain</p>
<p>right something</p>
<p>right yeah another stephen king book</p>
<p>stephen king</p>
<p>oh no it was strange days was it</p>
<p>strange days was another</p>
<p>virtual reality something</p>
<p>crazy ass i</p>
<p>think it was strange days</p>
<p>that was an awesome man</p>
<p>strange days this guy</p>
<p>right here just said that i can&rsquo;t wait for strange days</p>
<p>to become true that&rsquo;s what it was it was strange was it</p>
<p>yeah that was the one</p>
<p>angela bassett</p>
<p>right yeah she will forever be tina</p>
<p>turner sorry you</p>
<p>gotta love do any other</p>
<p>movies i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re tina turner um</p>
<p>was gonna say oh this is fucking miss</p>
<p>beverly hills</p>
<p>cheer about this</p>
<p>yeah another one of</p>
<p>these beauty pageant</p>
<p>chicks came out saying that</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe the gay should be</p>
<p>married and she you know she</p>
<p>quoted leviticus in the old testament</p>
<p>saying that the</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>bible says that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some stupid quote like</p>
<p>any man who lays down with a man as if</p>
<p>you know the same way lays down with a</p>
<p>woman it&rsquo;s an abomination</p>
<p>should be put to death</p>
<p>so she came out and said that</p>
<p>gay should be put to death haha</p>
<p>i love it like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s supporting the old testament</p>
<p>which by the way i mean</p>
<p>whatever you fucking</p>
<p>wanna believe</p>
<p>about religion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all well and good you know who knows if</p>
<p>god is real</p>
<p>who knows i mean</p>
<p>it could be that</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>bible is completely</p>
<p>ridiculous cause god wants</p>
<p>things confusing who knows</p>
<p>but it gets a certain</p>
<p>point when you read certain</p>
<p>things you gotta go all right</p>
<p>every people</p>
<p>are full of shit and there was no internet back then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you know there was a copy of the the the</p>
<p>bible on wikipedia</p>
<p>and people kept altering it but everybody was like</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s not what it says</p>
<p>and they went back and changed it</p>
<p>you know they didn&rsquo;t the old testament</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>write that fucking</p>
<p>thing down for</p>
<p>like a thousand years it was just stories</p>
<p>you know and the idea that</p>
<p>those stories</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell i can&rsquo;t tell a</p>
<p>story to him</p>
<p>and he tells it to his girlfriend</p>
<p>his girlfriend</p>
<p>writes it in a blog</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>story it&rsquo;ll be fucked up for sure</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t tell you how many times like</p>
<p>someone has gone to one of my gigs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve said something</p>
<p>and then a guy</p>
<p>like will quote on twitter</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ll do that was so</p>
<p>funny last night when you said this</p>
<p>about that i&rsquo;m like damn i didn&rsquo;t say that like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>something fucked up what i said was a lot nicer</p>
<p>you know but when</p>
<p>when you realize like</p>
<p>that memories are so fucking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way there&rsquo;s no way you</p>
<p>could be that accurate</p>
<p>over a thousand years or people talking about it</p>
<p>and then on top of it</p>
<p>the original</p>
<p>the old testament</p>
<p>bible was written in ancient hebrew</p>
<p>and to this day</p>
<p>they only know</p>
<p>three out of four words in ancient hebrew 25</p>
<p>of the words</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a clue as to what they mean</p>
<p>not only that</p>
<p>letters and numbers were the same</p>
<p>thing back then there were no numbers</p>
<p>so the letter a</p>
<p>was also the number one</p>
<p>so there was like numerical</p>
<p>value in words</p>
<p>like the word love</p>
<p>and the word god</p>
<p>they have the same numerical</p>
<p>value in ancient hebrew</p>
<p>but as soon as they</p>
<p>translated that to</p>
<p>latin and to greek</p>
<p>that shit was all gone that shit was all lost so</p>
<p>for this dumb</p>
<p>bitch to sit and</p>
<p>think that god wants people to put</p>
<p>put to death that they&rsquo;re gay like</p>
<p>this is with the miss</p>
<p>beverly hills</p>
<p>this is a new one new miss</p>
<p>california in</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s supposed to be so</p>
<p>liberal it ain&rsquo;t miss texas</p>
<p>do you know who carrie</p>
<p>anne panchy</p>
<p>is or whatever her name is she&rsquo;s from celebrity rehab</p>

<p>threesome with the guy from grey&rsquo;s anatomy</p>

<p>lying there and she had her little feet up in the air</p>
<p>just rocking back and forth and</p>
<p>she just two hands</p>
<p>just grabs it</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to say like what do you say to that you go</p>

<p>weird shit with kids when you were little did i play</p>
<p>doctor me and my friend play doctor with all the girls</p>
<p>in our neighborhood</p>
<p>and i remember the only time i remember the most</p>
<p>we had three girls</p>
<p>lined up and we were like okay we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be putting pencils in your vaginas</p>
<p>take off the pants</p>
<p>so we took off</p>
<p>other pants and</p>
<p>we just went back to each one</p>
<p>then we pull it out and smell it</p>
<p>and go to oh</p>
<p>dude what the</p>
<p>fuck but we were all like fine you could give</p>
<p>those girls lead poison</p>
<p>i know they</p>
<p>might be retarded now because of you</p>

<p>watching what</p>
<p>you should on</p>
<p>facebook you</p>
<p>should ask them</p>
<p>all questions does anybody remember anything</p>
<p>about pencils</p>
<p>so you remember me putting a pencil in your</p>
<p>crush but this</p>
<p>so this beauty pageant</p>
<p>thing that we saw at the hotel</p>

<p>these weirdo</p>
<p>fucking religious people</p>

<p>dressed as a fucking prostitute</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a six year old</p>
<p>dress as a prostitute and you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about church</p>
<p>they had high heeled shoes on</p>
<p>i mean like this high</p>
<p>which the only reason why</p>
<p>shoes have heels like that is so that</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s legs look longer</p>
<p>so that guys</p>
<p>think about them</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re pushing</p>
<p>these long legs back and fucking the shit out of you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>those that long leg</p>
<p>thing why do you</p>
<p>think what do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s there for</p>
<p>you sacrificing how you can walk</p>

<p>ridiculous i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t worn</p>
<p>a tie in a long i did a documentary recently on dmt</p>
<p>and i had to wear a tie</p>
<p>because i played like a rod</p>
<p>sterling type narrator</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really interesting documentary on dmt</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be out</p>
<p>sometime in the spring</p>
<p>but i had to wear a tie</p>
<p>i had no idea how to tie this fucking thing</p>
<p>i had no idea</p>
<p>the last time i wore a tie was</p>
<p>my my first</p>
<p>album grab that</p>
<p>thing off the wall real</p>
<p>quick my first album</p>
<p>in nineteen ninety nine</p>
<p>you know just as a goof</p>
<p>one of things i always said that i love</p>
<p>about being a comedian is</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to wear a fucking tie and so</p>
<p>just my first cd</p>
<p>for whatever reason i just thought it</p>
<p>would be funny</p>
<p>if i wore a tie</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>just look strange</p>
<p>i had to wear a tie for like 10 years</p>
<p>every day suck</p>
<p>yeah if you want to</p>
<p>work in business man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an agreement like everyone has to know</p>
<p>that you are willing to wear something</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re following by the the very</p>
<p>obvious rules of behavior it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be really easy to predict</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people like like i&rsquo;m a gentleman</p>
<p>you know like as a gentleman</p>
<p>well i feel this i&rsquo;m a gentleman</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a tie on</p>
<p>hello gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this like</p>
<p>this agreement that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get too crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my dr phil</p>
<p>impression you know</p>
<p>bottom my shoes are shining</p>
<p>they are very</p>
<p>slippery i&rsquo;m not chasing</p>
<p>after anybody you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something to that there&rsquo;s something to this</p>
<p>this silly outfit</p>
<p>that you wear that&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>like if people</p>
<p>started doing business</p>
<p>and they had like</p>
<p>rash guards on like</p>
<p>micro rash guards on like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready to go</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and</p>
<p>shit you know</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>why why would</p>
<p>that be bad but it is bad you know you can&rsquo;t have like</p>
<p>board shorts and</p>
<p>you know saying</p>
<p>you know running</p>
<p>shoes on and you look like you like</p>
<p>ready to fucking pounce</p>
<p>on people that nobody wants that in business you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>when you go to business you have to be</p>
<p>dressed uncomfortable</p>
<p>your button has to be all the way up here</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous you know i hate it</p>
<p>i remember i</p>
<p>used to work at this architect firm for my stepfather</p>
<p>and this was when i was</p>
<p>big into acid and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so every time i</p>
<p>would come to work i was either</p>
<p>hungover still</p>
<p>tripping on acid</p>
<p>then you know or something like that</p>
<p>it was such a boring job that</p>
<p>it was acceptable because all that i had to do is make</p>
<p>copies of architect plans do you</p>
<p>think you you fucked up your</p>
<p>brain on acid</p>
<p>do you think you have fucked up your</p>
<p>brain on um</p>
<p>no no i i think i think if</p>
<p>when i was doing it i was</p>
<p>was there any</p>
<p>point i like you know you ever</p>
<p>heard howard stern talk</p>
<p>about his acid trip</p>
<p>no howard stern</p>
<p>talked about it on the</p>
<p>radio and i</p>
<p>guess he did like a</p>
<p>giant dose of acid like way too much and</p>
<p>he was like all fucked up for like a long time</p>
<p>like he was hearing</p>
<p>voices and it was just like a like a real</p>
<p>psychotic episode and</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>psychedelics so you got</p>
<p>to make sure you don&rsquo;t fuck around and do too much like</p>
<p>dennis mckenna had an</p>
<p>experience like that too</p>
<p>dennis mckenna</p>
<p>with whose terrence mckenna&rsquo;s brother they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>famous psychonauts from</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>pioneers and</p>
<p>in the 70s they went to</p>
<p>brazil and he took</p>
<p>way too much mushrooms</p>
<p>and he lost his mind for</p>
<p>like two weeks like he couldn&rsquo;t communicate with people</p>
<p>you know and the last time i did dmt</p>
<p>i was fucking</p>
<p>whacked out for like two</p>
<p>solid weeks</p>
<p>not totally</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>guess if you were talking to me</p>
<p>i was totally normal</p>
<p>i did shows</p>
<p>the shows went great</p>
<p>i went to work i did fear factor</p>
<p>that went great</p>
<p>you know nothing got fucked up in</p>
<p>my but my head was like</p>
<p>i felt very</p>
<p>you know you feel like your consciousness is like in a</p>
<p>foundation your consciousness</p>
<p>is like you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like booms</p>
<p>solid this is</p>
<p>me good morning you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>hi honey kiss your</p>
<p>girlfriend brush your</p>
<p>teeth this is fucking solid</p>
<p>when i did the dmt my consciousness was like</p>
<p>a little tiny raft in a fucked up</p>
<p>ocean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like nothing seemed</p>
<p>like i kept having</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>that cars were gonna come</p>
<p>launching themselves over the</p>
<p>boundaries and hit my car</p>
<p>while i was driving</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like why am i</p>
<p>thinking this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like what is this about</p>
<p>and then i realized that what it was was</p>
<p>this idea of worrying</p>
<p>about possible disasters</p>
<p>was my ego&rsquo;s way of regaining</p>
<p>ground and letting me know that it has to have</p>
<p>a certain amount of</p>
<p>real estate in reality and that</p>
<p>if you want to do</p>
<p>crazy crazy</p>
<p>psychedelics and go into</p>
<p>other dimensions communicate with entities and</p>
<p>and reevaluate</p>
<p>you know your</p>
<p>whole position in the</p>
<p>world and then</p>
<p>humankind&rsquo;s</p>
<p>position with each</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>well and good but there&rsquo;s some real shit in the world</p>
<p>that the ego has to be there</p>
<p>for and the ego was like sending me a message um dude</p>
<p>but if a fucking</p>
<p>car launched</p>
<p>itself at you better be fucking paying attention</p>
<p>like there was a certain amount of</p>
<p>of where it was such a mind blowing experience</p>
<p>that there was like a</p>
<p>wrestling match</p>
<p>going on in my head between my ego</p>
<p>and between this new information and accepting</p>
<p>all this new information from the</p>
<p>psychedelic trip</p>
<p>and in incorporating it into the way i look at</p>
<p>everyday life you know and like</p>
<p>you know you think</p>
<p>about someone who&rsquo;s like a real like a shaman</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>living in the jungle and they&rsquo;re all at</p>
<p>peace in the world</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not calling people douchebags on the internet</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a certain amount of enlightenment</p>
<p>that if you achieve it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make it very hard for you to function</p>
<p>in the regular</p>
<p>world and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s one of the most important</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>psychedelic trips like there&rsquo;s a lot of cripples</p>
<p>in the psychedelic</p>
<p>world and in the weed world too</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so into</p>
<p>these experiences</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>incorporate it into</p>
<p>their everyday life and they&rsquo;re almost</p>
<p>crippled in</p>
<p>their everyday life because of it</p>
<p>and no psychedelic</p>
<p>experience is</p>
<p>worth anything unless</p>
<p>you can take what you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned from it</p>
<p>and enhance regular life enhance</p>
<p>your communication</p>
<p>with people your relationships with people</p>
<p>enhance the way you look at the</p>
<p>world enhance your career path</p>
<p>the kind of friends you hang around with unless</p>
<p>it can enhance you</p>
<p>the reality is</p>
<p>we live in this</p>
<p>world for eight</p>
<p>hours a day or 12</p>
<p>hours a day or however long you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>awake this world</p>
<p>this shit this concrete</p>
<p>world is real</p>
<p>and you have to</p>
<p>manage your way through this and</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs make it very difficult</p>
<p>to do that if you want to have a regular job i</p>
<p>think psychedelics</p>
<p>the main thing with</p>
<p>psychedelics is it opens up a door and</p>
<p>in the past</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been offered dmt</p>
<p>but i won&rsquo;t do it because</p>
<p>like when i first did</p>
<p>mushrooms that opened up to a door of</p>
<p>things i never thought of or saw before</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>gonna go away</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t damage my head but now that i know that</p>
<p>exists i know it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>and so when acid did the same thing</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>point where i have to go okay is this door does</p>
<p>this door need to be open is this anything positive</p>
<p>with this door being open</p>
<p>and some drugs are like that for me</p>
<p>cause like salvia</p>
<p>was the closest to the</p>
<p>point where i was like okay that is a</p>
<p>scary door that i opened up</p>
<p>cause that just pretty much made</p>
<p>everything seem fake</p>
<p>like it was like</p>
<p>this world is fake</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>and i know that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>but it opened up that door</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like okay that&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>too much of a door i shouldn&rsquo;t have opened up that door</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m never gonna be able to</p>
<p>get back that</p>
<p>that thought of not knowing that was there i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s pretty we&rsquo;re pretty much saying the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it may if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring it back and incorporate it into your</p>
<p>everyday life and like sometimes you open up</p>
<p>these doors you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>the fuck am i</p>
<p>gonna do with this</p>
<p>right and then your</p>
<p>everyday life is just</p>
<p>whacked out some</p>
<p>people like</p>
<p>going back to that</p>
<p>that road so much though and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it gets fucking</p>
<p>scary well you know what i</p>
<p>think most of</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>their real world is not so hot right</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it becomes an escape</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it should be an escape i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you should ever escape</p>
<p>reality you&rsquo;re here this is this is life</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the life can be a</p>
<p>magical fucking intense</p>
<p>fantastic experience if you manage it correctly</p>
<p>but if you just</p>
<p>wanna escape all the time i&rsquo;ve gotta</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re probably fucking up in this life and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s imbalanced you know</p>
<p>the people that always</p>
<p>wanna go and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like the same</p>
<p>thing with like</p>
<p>video games like remember i told you</p>
<p>about this dude</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>dude who used to be the manager at the comedy</p>
<p>store that was addicted to everquest</p>
<p>just completely addicted 8 10 12</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>lost everything lost his job lost his life</p>
<p>he just was so pale</p>
<p>you would see him he was so pale</p>
<p>looked like he</p>
<p>never saw sunlight like he</p>
<p>would order in food and</p>
<p>never leave the fucking</p>
<p>house for days</p>
<p>and he came down the comedy</p>
<p>storm one night</p>
<p>and he goes it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird i&rsquo;m so good</p>
<p>at making money</p>
<p>in my online life and so bad in my real life</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>started to realize that like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fucking loser</p>
<p>in this life because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s excited</p>
<p>and puts all of his passion and energy into this</p>
<p>other life but that&rsquo;s just really because this</p>
<p>other life is a new and</p>
<p>exciting thing</p>
<p>a new and artificial</p>
<p>thing and he can control it from</p>
<p>his computer</p>
<p>without dealing with emotions and dealing with all</p>
<p>the fears and anxieties that the real</p>
<p>world presents but</p>
<p>the reality is</p>
<p>if we live life in a computer screen</p>
<p>and we were offered the real world</p>
<p>as a video game</p>
<p>the real world</p>
<p>would be so much more fantastic</p>
<p>you know we just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of it</p>
<p>as being fantastic because we&rsquo;re so goddamn used to it</p>
<p>you know if we</p>
<p>lived life in a computer</p>
<p>in a computer</p>
<p>monitor and that&rsquo;s how you were when you were born</p>
<p>and then one day someone</p>
<p>said you know hey we&rsquo;ve developed this new game that</p>
<p>allows you to go outside</p>
<p>and you go outside and you actually get laid</p>
<p>and you can go and have a real drink</p>
<p>and you feel it you do a real shot of jack tanners</p>
<p>you go holy shit this is real i can&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>know you go get laid for real</p>
<p>and you drive a car for real</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like dude the real</p>
<p>world is the fucking shit</p>
<p>you would never want to play</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>the reason why we want to play</p>
<p>video games is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a world that we can control</p>
<p>completely independent from all</p>
<p>the pros and cons of this</p>
<p>solid world</p>
<p>completely independent</p>
<p>of the emotions and the insecurities</p>
<p>and all the shit that we all</p>
<p>experience but</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>but the reason why we</p>
<p>experience insecurities and anxiety and anger</p>
<p>these are all like little chemical signals</p>
<p>to guide you</p>
<p>towards a proper life</p>
<p>like what i</p>
<p>found in life</p>
<p>most importantly more than anything is the one</p>
<p>the way that i&rsquo;m the most happiest</p>
<p>is if i&rsquo;m putting out positive energy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m putting out positive energy to people to friends</p>
<p>positive energy on</p>
<p>stage positive energy with my writing my work</p>
<p>with anything</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing it&rsquo;s all friendly and positive and</p>
<p>happy and if you do that</p>
<p>you can have a fucking</p>
<p>fantastic life the problem is it&rsquo;s just difficult to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to keep your shit together it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>not to lose your temper it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>not to you know be obsessed with something and</p>
<p>get sidetracked</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like gambling addictions and masturbation</p>
<p>addictions and all that shit that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re trying to distract yourselves</p>
<p>from from all the pain of being a</p>
<p>human you know</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>fucking hunter</p>
<p>s thompson had a</p>
<p>quote like that like</p>
<p>man making himself a beast</p>
<p>to get away</p>
<p>from the pain of being a man i forgot exactly what the</p>
<p>quote was but</p>
<p>something along</p>
<p>those lines</p>
<p>like we distract the shit of ourselves because</p>
<p>the game of life is fucking hard to do man</p>
<p>just like a</p>
<p>video game is hard to do</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>back when i used to play</p>
<p>quake like all the time i played</p>
<p>quake like hours and</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>and you and i played</p>
<p>quake online</p>
<p>we played against each other</p>
<p>and you can tell</p>
<p>the difference between someone is playing all the time</p>
<p>because you get really good at it</p>
<p>you know you know</p>
<p>where those buckets are</p>
<p>gonna go and i was</p>
<p>sticking rail guns up your ass and electric yeah</p>
<p>i think you won</p>
<p>120 games and i won one</p>
<p>yeah maybe not totally not fair</p>
<p>and believe me there&rsquo;s dudes online that</p>
<p>would do that to me just rape me</p>
<p>why because they had put so much time in this fucking</p>
<p>crazy game they</p>
<p>would get good at it but</p>
<p>since you hadn&rsquo;t put time</p>
<p>how frustrating was it</p>
<p>so fuck zero</p>
<p>so you didn&rsquo;t want to play</p>
<p>right you want to shut it off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly the same as life</p>
<p>if you get good at life the game</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s fun as fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re leonardo dicaprio</p>
<p>life must be the shit</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>he starred in movies</p>
<p>driving a ferrari</p>
<p>banging supermodels what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a gigantic fucking mansion i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a boob</p>
<p>it must be so fun for him</p>
<p>but not everybody</p>
<p>could be leonardo dicaprio</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re the fucking garbage man who&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>came home and his wife is fucking the the newspaper guy</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not a fun life that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>a guy who&rsquo;s not good at</p>
<p>quake getting murdered</p>
<p>in a game it&rsquo;s not fun man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like playing pool</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>like i play pool i love pool i get obsessed with it</p>
<p>but i have a friend my friend max eberly</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a professional</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a top professional</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of winning when he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>stroke capable of winning any tournament in the</p>
<p>world i mean he&rsquo;s really fucking good</p>
<p>and when i play</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s so frustrating and i play pretty good</p>
<p>like for a regular person i play good</p>
<p>but for like a pro</p>
<p>not even fucking</p>
<p>close so when</p>
<p>i play max it&rsquo;s just getting my ass handed to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just getting fucked</p>
<p>the only time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun is when we play on a really really tight</p>
<p>table so occasionally he misses</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m like oh i get to shoot</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s much better at that game</p>
<p>you should give him a handicap</p>
<p>or some sort of thing</p>
<p>no we just we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t play for anything and it&rsquo;s good for me</p>
<p>good for me because</p>
<p>you get used to playing</p>
<p>against a guy like that it&rsquo;s not as fun as playing</p>
<p>against a guy who&rsquo;s like your speed</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good for your game because it makes sure that you</p>
<p>capitalize on</p>
<p>every mistake</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;ll play</p>
<p>a guy who&rsquo;s not as good as you and you&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about this</p>
<p>because if i miss this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna miss and i&rsquo;ll have another shot</p>
<p>but with max</p>
<p>every time you miss you like fuck i better</p>
<p>you know i better sit down for a while</p>
<p>anyway i believe that</p>
<p>the hunter s</p>
<p>quote is actually from</p>
<p>samuel johnson and english author</p>
<p>thank you very much sir i thought it was a hundred</p>
<p>times a quote</p>
<p>thank you cj</p>
<p>mik l hinny</p>
<p>mik l hinny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how what</p>
<p>about words with names like schwarzenegger</p>
<p>how the fuck did that ever</p>
<p>get through</p>
<p>like what what culture</p>
<p>ran out of sounds</p>
<p>people that</p>
<p>like string</p>
<p>together something nutty like that people that like to</p>
<p>write in cursive</p>
<p>is that anything this is</p>
<p>gonna be the best cursive writing i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right like manuscripts they used to</p>
<p>write it on</p>
<p>page they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have lines in the</p>
<p>paper they just had paper</p>
<p>right and they</p>
<p>would write it exactly</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>heard of the voying</p>
<p>manuscript the</p>
<p>voignet manuscript i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;m saying it</p>
<p>right is this</p>
<p>ancient manuscript that was found</p>
<p>hundreds of years old</p>
<p>and they have no fucking</p>
<p>idea what it says they don&rsquo;t know the language oh they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about it they don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just nonsense if some guy was just practicing scribble</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like really long</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s consistency and how it&rsquo;s written but</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t decode it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>top encryption</p>
<p>experts and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very divided like some people believe it&rsquo;s a hoax</p>
<p>and some people</p>
<p>believe that it&rsquo;s some fucking lost language</p>
<p>and some people</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>glossal alia</p>
<p>like when someone talks in tongues</p>
<p>and that they just went</p>
<p>into a fucking</p>
<p>trance and just some retard with a pen</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s got really good writing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got diagrams in it and really good really good</p>
<p>illustrations rather</p>
<p>and diagrams in it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really complicated</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they found that</p>
<p>that temple and</p>
<p>turkey that is a</p>
<p>seven thousand years</p>
<p>older than the pyramids</p>
<p>very complex</p>
<p>stone temple</p>
<p>carved out of</p>
<p>stone and shit</p>
<p>and now they have to like rewrite like</p>
<p>human history</p>
<p>because like</p>
<p>seven thousand years before</p>
<p>egypt is nine thousand ten thousand bc</p>
<p>and ten thousand bc they were already</p>
<p>like had temples and were worshipping shit and like</p>
<p>that throws a</p>
<p>monkey ranch</p>
<p>clank into the</p>
<p>whole gears</p>
<p>of this the idea of</p>
<p>cultural evolution</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s been this guy</p>
<p>john anthony west</p>
<p>john anthony west looked that up on google</p>
<p>because this guy is fascinating he&rsquo;s got an awesome</p>
<p>dvd series called</p>
<p>magical egypt</p>
<p>and this guy is obsessed with egypt he</p>
<p>spent his entire life</p>
<p>studying egypt</p>
<p>and he believes that the</p>
<p>egyptian culture goes back</p>
<p>way way way before the established timelines</p>
<p>the established timelines for</p>
<p>egyptian cultures like 2</p>
<p>500 bc that&rsquo;s when they</p>
<p>think like the pyramids were built</p>
<p>and that the</p>
<p>culture goes back a little bit before that but not much</p>
<p>and he thinks it goes back like 35 000 years</p>
<p>he thinks that</p>
<p>people have been around way way longer</p>
<p>and that there was some big</p>
<p>break somewhere</p>
<p>along the line like probably</p>
<p>some sort of a natural cataclysmic disaster</p>
<p>like a meteor impact or something like that</p>
<p>you know and it</p>
<p>could be you know 10</p>
<p>000 15 000 years ago like they don&rsquo;t know when it was</p>
<p>but they think that there was like an advanced culture</p>
<p>and then boom it got fucked up and then</p>
<p>culture rebuilds and society rebuilds</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s left is like they&rsquo;re living in this</p>
<p>shit that was made thousands and thousands of years ago</p>
<p>and they tried</p>
<p>to imitate it and recreate it and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and he believes that that&rsquo;s what it is like</p>
<p>these fucked up pyramids that they have in egypt</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>these pyramids were like the</p>
<p>first pyramids</p>
<p>he thinks much much more likely</p>
<p>these pyramids were probably like people were</p>
<p>like trying to duplicate</p>
<p>other shit duplicate shit that was already there</p>
<p>you know they believe that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not his theory that&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>his theory is</p>
<p>one of the things is</p>
<p>about the sphinx</p>
<p>they brought in geologists</p>
<p>and the geologists have like documented the</p>
<p>erosion on the sphinx</p>
<p>and they say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water erosion</p>
<p>like thousands</p>
<p>of years of rainfall have cut deep fissures</p>
<p>in the whole</p>
<p>enclosure with the sphinxes</p>
<p>and the problem</p>
<p>with that is the last time there was rainfall</p>
<p>in the nile valley was like</p>
<p>seven thousand nine thousand bc</p>
<p>so that would mean that the</p>
<p>this the pyramids</p>
<p>and over the</p>
<p>space around it</p>
<p>would have to be like</p>
<p>seven thousand years</p>
<p>older than the established timeline</p>
<p>and so course</p>
<p>none of the</p>
<p>the egyptologists like the guys have been</p>
<p>teaching forever</p>
<p>that the pyramids and the</p>
<p>sphinx and all that was built</p>
<p>about 2500 bc</p>
<p>they never want they don&rsquo;t want to accept it</p>
<p>they go well</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the evidence for this</p>
<p>culture like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there man there&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>rainfall for</p>
<p>thousands of years have created this and geologists are</p>
<p>universal about that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s disputing that geologists are all saying he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>this guy ron</p>
<p>shock who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>professor at boston</p>
<p>university has</p>
<p>got over a hundred</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>professors geologists</p>
<p>to sign off</p>
<p>on the fact that this is undoubtedly</p>
<p>water erosion</p>
<p>which completely changes the timeline</p>
<p>for when the</p>
<p>sphinx was built</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of that shit</p>
<p>going on in</p>
<p>egypt they believe that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>probably you know</p>
<p>maybe even 30 000 years old there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a mass extinction took place</p>
<p>on the earth</p>
<p>somewhere around 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>woolly mammoths died</p>
<p>instantaneously</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>saber tooth</p>
<p>tigers died noah&rsquo;s ark</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s before them</p>
<p>but the the</p>
<p>like 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>north america</p>
<p>like half of</p>
<p>north america was</p>
<p>under a mile high</p>
<p>sheet of ice</p>
<p>like there was an ice</p>
<p>age going on</p>
<p>and something killed it and</p>
<p>ended it like instantaneously</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>likely that it was a fucking natural disaster it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>likely that it was a fucking meteor impact that some</p>
<p>well whatever that guy&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>distracting the shit out of me son don&rsquo;t look at me</p>
<p>well don&rsquo;t fucking have a monitor open in</p>
<p>front of me</p>
<p>dude surfing he&rsquo;s not even pay attention</p>
<p>we do one week podcast</p>
<p>this dude is so addicted</p>
<p>to the internet he can&rsquo;t even talk for one week i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard you talked before</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard me</p>
<p>talk well this is online dude there&rsquo;s 675 people that</p>
<p>have not heard this</p>
<p>story don&rsquo;t look at me</p>
<p>shut up faggot</p>
<p>anyway i think people have been around way longer</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s much more likely that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ridiculous that people</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>and how long this</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s been around you know what i mean</p>
<p>oh like people believe that</p>
<p>earth&rsquo;s 10 000</p>
<p>years old it just drives me</p>
<p>crazy well you know that&rsquo;s a not</p>
<p>monster number more than 50</p>
<p>of america according to a gallup poll</p>
<p>which is not the same because</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing about polls</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say like according to a recent poll</p>
<p>50 of americans believe this because no</p>
<p>no according to your recent poll</p>
<p>50 of americans</p>
<p>who are fucking retarded enough to answer your poll</p>
<p>believe in that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reality of</p>
<p>polls are never representative of anybody intelligent</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t get me to answer a fucking poll</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get you you got shit to do don&rsquo;t you have a</p>
<p>hobby you hear</p>
<p>if someone calls you may i have five minutes your time</p>

<p>20 of americans can&rsquo;t find the united</p>
<p>states on a</p>
<p>globe is that true</p>
<p>joe beef don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>lying joe beef is</p>
<p>lying joe beef</p>
<p>would you make that shit up</p>
<p>solar flares</p>
<p>up in two thousand</p>
<p>twelve bro we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crossing the galactic equator then</p>
<p>you know what you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>which is a richard</p>
<p>tyson is that his name is</p>
<p>what is that guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>the astronomer</p>
<p>really neil</p>
<p>tyson neil tyson</p>
<p>very very intelligent</p>
<p>guy and i really like listen to him talk</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>things he said</p>
<p>about this whole</p>
<p>crossing the aquatic</p>
<p>whatever the</p>
<p>what is it what is that the exact</p>
<p>the way this guy</p>
<p>galactic equator</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what this guy said</p>
<p>yeah like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crossing through the center of the galaxy like we were</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s in line</p>
<p>on december 21st</p>
<p>2012 you know what he says</p>
<p>he says that happens all the time</p>
<p>it says he says that</p>
<p>like that like line up with the center of the galaxy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen then because it happens all the time</p>
<p>and nothing happens so</p>
<p>who knows if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right or if he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super skeptical</p>
<p>but i think what&rsquo;s much more likely is</p>
<p>gonna happen in</p>
<p>2012 is something technological</p>
<p>something technological some</p>
<p>crazy invention</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>could be anything</p>
<p>it could be that too it</p>
<p>could be that</p>
<p>2012 what really happens is</p>
<p>nothing happens</p>
<p>and then people realize oh</p>
<p>we have to actually manage this life we can&rsquo;t just rely</p>
<p>on fucking aliens landing</p>
<p>i was more scared</p>
<p>about 2 000 just because that makes</p>
<p>sense like all the computers</p>
<p>planes dropping from the sky</p>
<p>i was scared too i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t do a gig</p>
<p>in 2000 i stayed home</p>
<p>yeah i thought for</p>
<p>sure there was at</p>
<p>least gonna be something small</p>
<p>when two thousand isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s ten years ago now</p>
<p>time is just</p>
<p>fucking flying by man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy fast it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>it almost feels like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quicker every year</p>
<p>and everybody says that but</p>
<p>what if time really is quicker</p>
<p>what if like</p>
<p>clocks are moving</p>
<p>quicker too we just can&rsquo;t really establish</p>
<p>it because that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense cause what</p>
<p>about digital</p>
<p>clocks well no</p>
<p>they all exist in this</p>
<p>dimension maybe this dimension is moving quicker</p>
<p>units of timer</p>
<p>know almost</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re forgetting more</p>
<p>so it feels like we&rsquo;re forgetting more</p>
<p>of the day because we have more information yeah yeah</p>
<p>maybe right</p>
<p>mm hmm i&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>five potatoes</p>
<p>thoughts on the zeitgeist movement</p>
<p>you know what i think</p>
<p>about zeitgeist and all that stuff</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of zeitgeist that&rsquo;s poorly researched</p>
<p>like this stuff that he said about mithra</p>
<p>and different different</p>
<p>gods and stuff that</p>
<p>that are just like</p>
<p>jesus love that is</p>
<p>really poorly researched and incorrect and been proven</p>
<p>wrong there&rsquo;s a website that says</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>debunking zeitgeist</p>
<p>or something like that i forget what the</p>
<p>what the website is titled but</p>
<p>i mean the guy just</p>
<p>breaks down all the</p>
<p>errors that the dude who made the</p>
<p>movie made and it&rsquo;s just you know he&rsquo;s quoting</p>
<p>references and showing very</p>
<p>clearly that the</p>
<p>zeitgeist guys made some big problem big big fuck ups</p>
<p>and i think his</p>
<p>whole though</p>
<p>how sure he is this</p>
<p>september 11th was was</p>
<p>designed and</p>
<p>that you know the</p>
<p>and perpetrated by the us government and that</p>
<p>tower one and</p>
<p>tower two fell</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>were detonated like you&rsquo;re sure of that you know</p>
<p>look no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sure that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you can&rsquo;t say free sport</p>
<p>all this talk of free fall</p>
<p>speed and the</p>
<p>towers fell at free fall speed</p>
<p>yeah they fell pretty</p>
<p>fucking fast but that&rsquo;s what happens when shit falls</p>
<p>apart it falls</p>
<p>apart pretty fucking fast</p>
<p>especially shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super heavy</p>
<p>and gigantic</p>
<p>and all that weight is on and it&rsquo;s all just collapsing</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what happens</p>
<p>when you build a</p>
<p>building that way and you fly a fucking</p>
<p>giant plane filled with jet fuel into it</p>
<p>the only way to really know</p>
<p>mean you can have theories</p>
<p>but the only way to really know is to</p>
<p>build another building</p>
<p>and fly another</p>
<p>jet into it exactly the same way and see what happens</p>
<p>and if it falls down exactly like that one</p>
<p>then the argument&rsquo;s pretty much over and if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t then</p>
<p>you have to go well okay well what was inside the</p>
<p>building did it all burn the same</p>
<p>was it exactly constructed the same</p>
<p>you know and you</p>
<p>gotta try it</p>
<p>again i mean</p>
<p>you have to fucking have more than two</p>
<p>buildings to go on</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>buildings have</p>
<p>never fallen before</p>
<p>look the government does some</p>
<p>nasty evil shit that is</p>
<p>absolutely a fact</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know you don&rsquo;t know what happened there and to say</p>
<p>that you know is just as bad as people who</p>
<p>blindly trust in the us government the thing</p>
<p>that i have a big question</p>
<p>about when it comes to september 11th</p>
<p>is tower seven</p>
<p>and if you watch</p>
<p>video online this</p>
<p>video of tower</p>
<p>seven falling</p>
<p>and it falls just like a controlled demolition</p>
<p>i mean it just goes straight down whoosh</p>
<p>all at once and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy to watch man</p>
<p>you know because like</p>
<p>it implodes from the basement down and every</p>
<p>level falls apart</p>
<p>including like jets of energy like</p>
<p>spraying out of windows like there&rsquo;s blasts</p>
<p>i mean maybe that</p>
<p>could be because it&rsquo;s collapsing</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>floor of air being</p>
<p>straight through</p>
<p>the window but the problem is it all falls the</p>
<p>exact same time and that</p>
<p>building wasn&rsquo;t even hit by a plane</p>
<p>it was on fire</p>
<p>and it had a hole in it from like</p>
<p>debris and stuff</p>
<p>and i could see it falling down</p>
<p>but there was a hole in one corner</p>
<p>and the hole</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a hole there and the</p>
<p>building&rsquo;s gonna collapse</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it collapse towards the hole</p>
<p>i mean doesn&rsquo;t that make</p>
<p>sense maybe</p>
<p>it also makes</p>
<p>sense the whole</p>
<p>standing on a pop can</p>
<p>thing where if you</p>
<p>stand on a pop can and you</p>
<p>knock a little bit off the side</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not falling over you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going straight down because of the weight</p>
<p>you know meaning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so heavy</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a hole on it</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going straight down</p>
<p>hmm that&rsquo;s maybe maybe</p>
<p>i i think with all that shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like yeah i&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s people that freak out</p>
<p>about and care</p>
<p>about it cause without them</p>
<p>you know the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get away with a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>
<p>but in my opinion you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care if the government did it fuck they did it you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still waking up eating my cereal</p>
<p>yeah but that is one</p>
<p>thing you have to consider i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you you mean how is this</p>
<p>gonna help you</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s this gonna help you in your life</p>
<p>i know if you get obsessed with this yeah it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the bottom line people that</p>
<p>think the government</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t kill people</p>
<p>and nobody died in</p>
<p>tower 7 supposedly</p>
<p>but the thing is</p>
<p>so hard to believe</p>
<p>people think the government</p>
<p>would not kill people</p>
<p>this is all you need to know</p>
<p>for sure they</p>
<p>start wars then don&rsquo;t need to be</p>
<p>started that&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>fact for sure</p>
<p>the gulf of</p>
<p>tonkin incident that got us into the vietnam war</p>
<p>that was a fake</p>
<p>fucking attack on americans they faked it</p>
<p>and they faked it made this big deal</p>
<p>about it so that everybody</p>
<p>would get fired up and realize we have to go to vietnam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fact this is history</p>
<p>you know and the fact that they wrote up a</p>
<p>thing called operation</p>
<p>northwoods the</p>
<p>northwoods document and the</p>
<p>northwoods document was</p>
<p>they were planning attacks</p>
<p>on americans</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna this is in 1962</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>going this is signed by the joint chiefs of</p>
<p>staff by the way</p>
<p>and vetoed by kennedy</p>
<p>they were gonna attack</p>
<p>guantanamo bay they were</p>
<p>gonna lob grenades into</p>
<p>mortars into guantanamo bay and possibly kill</p>
<p>american soldiers</p>
<p>they were gonna blow up a jet liner</p>
<p>and blame it on the cubans</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna tell americans</p>
<p>we have to go to war with cuba well people are</p>
<p>gonna fucking die in that war for sure</p>
<p>and people are</p>
<p>gonna die in</p>
<p>a war that americans didn&rsquo;t want and so they decided</p>
<p>to do what&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>false flag and make attacks on americans</p>
<p>and blame it on the cubans</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re willing to kill people</p>
<p>and only 3 000 people died in september</p>
<p>11th for sure that&rsquo;s a lot of people i&rsquo;m not making</p>
<p>light of it but</p>
<p>in comparison to how many people have died</p>
<p>in iraq during the fucking war</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about like a million</p>
<p>civilians have died in iraq</p>
<p>since the invasion a million</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy look at</p>
<p>haiti i mean</p>
<p>millions of people died from that</p>
<p>earthquake in haiti but</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have it hd video</p>
<p>fucking you know seeing it</p>
<p>yeah but we&rsquo;re not responsible for that</p>
<p>no mean well i know i know i know but i</p>
<p>think the reason</p>
<p>why is that they&rsquo;re willing to kill people</p>
<p>right right i</p>
<p>think the reason why we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focused on it</p>
<p>though is just because of that that we all</p>
<p>watched it live</p>
<p>where if you know</p>
<p>if we saw these people in a racket shot live on</p>
<p>tv would probably</p>
<p>be just as big as nine eleven you know</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>i think well</p>
<p>i think the idea was that</p>
<p>it was an attack on american soil i mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>why it was such a big deal</p>
<p>i mean i remember how everybody got so patriotic</p>
<p>after theirs</p>
<p>do you remember</p>
<p>after september 11th</p>
<p>how everybody had fucking american flags in their car</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>weird feeling you were</p>
<p>in ohio back then right</p>
<p>did they have them in ohio</p>
<p>oh yeah it was crazy bad</p>
<p>i left i went to work one day</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think i was doing fear factor at the time i</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>but i was driving</p>
<p>down down the</p>
<p>street near my house</p>
<p>and every fucking car had a american flag on it was</p>
<p>crazy yeah and i was like this is just</p>
<p>weird this is a</p>
<p>weird feeling it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like people are bowling up</p>
<p>like everybody just just go to fucking war</p>
<p>you know realize like how war like this fucking</p>
<p>culture really is and how</p>
<p>sheep like and</p>
<p>how people are just immediately willing to fight</p>
<p>you know and fight who</p>
<p>the people who did it are dead</p>
<p>like it was a suicide attack</p>
<p>so the people that were responsible for the</p>
<p>deaths of those people are all dead i mean</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those crazy</p>
<p>motherfuckers that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t believe that it was a real plane</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that believe that you know they were</p>
<p>piloted by remote control and the</p>
<p>planes were empty and</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>shit happened almost</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>10 years 10 years</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still talking</p>
<p>about it oh my god</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so frustrating</p>
<p>talking to the people who</p>
<p>claim to know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s really frustrating</p>
<p>man it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>plane it hit the pentagon it was a missile</p>
<p>where is all the people that died in the fucking</p>
<p>plane crash then what they just they took them and</p>
<p>why would they say it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>plane why would they</p>
<p>shoot a missile and say it&rsquo;s a plane</p>
<p>why were there all the</p>
<p>plane parts on the lawn</p>
<p>i mean come on man we talked</p>
<p>about this before it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>this yeah the</p>
<p>plane yeah i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;d actually last week or two weeks ago</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fear factor real nothing is real</p>
<p>depends on how much acid you take joe rogan hates</p>
<p>bruce springsteen</p>
<p>that is so not true it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true you just trying to get attention</p>
<p>motherfucker no i don&rsquo;t hate</p>
<p>bruce springsteen</p>
<p>born to run that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great fucking song</p>
<p>brilliant disguise that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great fucking song</p>
<p>never got it</p>
<p>dude i don&rsquo;t love all</p>
<p>bruce springsteen i&rsquo;m not gonna sit through a fucking</p>
<p>three hour concert of anybody&rsquo;s yeah</p>

<p>that especially all these</p>
<p>fucking mac guys get a pc</p>
<p>that mac garbage</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s the same guy over and over again and nicole</p>
<p>fan 2009 you are dumb</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re dumb you&rsquo;re a dumb person this whole</p>
<p>mac versus pc thing</p>
<p>what do you give a fuck</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>me that pcs are somehow another better than macs</p>
<p>guess what douchebag</p>
<p>pcs get viruses</p>
<p>max don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>with you viruses</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>viruses you</p>
<p>bring me one dude who&rsquo;s ever had a</p>
<p>virus on his fucking</p>
<p>mac one i know everyone i know who&rsquo;s had a pc except</p>
<p>voodoo chicken he</p>
<p>claims to have</p>
<p>never gotten a</p>
<p>virus that&rsquo;s a lie i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a lie</p>
<p>everybody gets</p>
<p>viruses on pcs just that</p>
<p>alone it&rsquo;s better to get a mac</p>
<p>second of all</p>
<p>max don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>crash nearly as much</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t a mac problem is a firefox problem</p>
<p>everything else on the computer work fine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i was able to reboot faggot</p>
<p>listen stop</p>
<p>worrying about mac</p>
<p>versus pc it&rsquo;s just a goddamn operating system</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the republicans</p>
<p>versus the democrats</p>
<p>most of the people on one side of the</p>
<p>other are just on a fucking team and</p>
<p>their simple little brains are</p>
<p>stuck on that team</p>
<p>they might not even</p>
<p>agree with half the shit the republican say</p>
<p>but they support them</p>
<p>and even say well we</p>
<p>gotta support our team you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree what they&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s important is we support them</p>
<p>and we know push forward and we get up</p>
<p>republican in office in 2012</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>washing redskins</p>
<p>versus the fucking</p>
<p>miami dolphins that&rsquo;s all that shit is it&rsquo;s teams</p>
<p>just like boston</p>
<p>versus philly</p>
<p>philly sucks boston rules</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same moronic bullshit all</p>
<p>right there there</p>
<p>is no fucking philly there is no boston it&rsquo;s nonsense</p>

<p>this is what caused all the fucking</p>
<p>trouble ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>a goddamn picture of me and david lee</p>
<p>roth but it was just to prove that</p>
<p>brian has been making this</p>
<p>crazy buffets for</p>
<p>years because this picture of david lee</p>
<p>roth was like was like from 2005</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like three or four</p>
<p>years ago before we got banned from the comedy or that</p>
<p>store thing yeah because it was at the comic</p>
<p>store right</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 2006 maybe</p>
<p>it was right before he got together with</p>
<p>back together with fan handling before they announced</p>
<p>that they were</p>
<p>going to get back together he was telling us</p>
<p>about it yeah</p>
<p>all right i just put it on my little twitter</p>
<p>and then you see brian in the</p>
<p>background making that crazy face he did that</p>
<p>no bullshit fucking hundreds of thousands of times</p>
<p>that was a long odyssey just to get one picture but</p>
<p>it really wasn&rsquo;t worth it</p>
<p>epic fail indeed indeed</p>
<p>always talking</p>
<p>about that and no key fan</p>
<p>that fella try out chat roulette</p>
<p>you know what i would think</p>
<p>about doing</p>
<p>that but i don&rsquo;t want to see any dudes cocks</p>
<p>randomly i i did it i</p>
<p>tried it out i put</p>
<p>i found this</p>
<p>somebody already did this before but i</p>
<p>found this big</p>
<p>black chick</p>
<p>and i put her on loop and then</p>
<p>did it just this and recorded the</p>
<p>screen and stuff</p>
<p>but it was like</p>
<p>maybe 90 percent cox</p>
<p>and i was like yeah it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>funny i don&rsquo;t i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really sad</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many creepy people out there that</p>
<p>come on well you know what it&rsquo;s dudes that want to show</p>
<p>their dicks at work and they just</p>
<p>never get the opportunity</p>
<p>but they get it home</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wearing a fucking</p>
<p>wrestling mask and they go</p>
<p>crazy and pull it</p>
<p>and this just suppression man it&rsquo;s like catholic</p>
<p>school girls</p>
<p>remember catholic</p>
<p>school girls when you were a kid</p>
<p>they were always the biggest sluts</p>
<p>right yeah yeah why</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>never seen dick</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re whisked away to some fucking</p>
<p>magical place</p>
<p>where only girls exist</p>
<p>they have all girl</p>
<p>teachers and shit and they&rsquo;re told that dicks are evil</p>
<p>and they just can&rsquo;t wait to suck one</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>those bitches</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait they can&rsquo;t wait to get up different</p>
<p>i just want to do the forbidden thing</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t suppress</p>
<p>human beings man</p>
<p>i like to do it with</p>
<p>maybe like a</p>
<p>five year old girl on loop just sitting there</p>
<p>going like this you know</p>
<p>like that and see if any of</p>
<p>these guys with the</p>
<p>dicks if they like put it away or if they sit no</p>
<p>they would fucking love it man you think</p>
<p>what we can record</p>
<p>them and put them on youtube</p>
<p>hmm that&rsquo;s not a bad idea</p>
<p>if we get a fake loop of just</p>
<p>a little kid just sitting there</p>
<p>going like like she&rsquo;s looking at the monitor</p>
<p>and see if the guy like immediately</p>
<p>disconnects or if he sits there</p>
<p>an extra couple</p>
<p>seconds hmm</p>
<p>so they well how does it work do they pull</p>
<p>their dicks out immediately</p>
<p>soon as the log yeah what it is is</p>
<p>right it just automatically put</p>
<p>you in with a room with another person both on webcam</p>
<p>and did they have</p>
<p>their dick out</p>
<p>instantly when i was</p>
<p>doing it when i was doing it was just</p>
<p>guy stroking it so</p>
<p>right when he went in there you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s what you should do</p>
<p>you should we</p>
<p>should get a</p>
<p>video of like a five or six year old girl</p>
<p>just freaking the fuck out from the beginning</p>
<p>right so it</p>
<p>only work in the guys that were to beaten off</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>otherwise we&rsquo;d have to time it like you know how</p>
<p>tired like normal you know and</p>
<p>going oh my god yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah and have her</p>
<p>scream call the police</p>
<p>call the police we didn&rsquo;t have to did we just had to</p>
<p>cook on you know that kind of a</p>
<p>better better call</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s freak this</p>
<p>motherfucker out you know</p>
<p>yeah because they can</p>
<p>catch you the freaky</p>
<p>weird dudes are mostly straight</p>
<p>gay get sex all the time we are less repressed</p>
<p>yeah right shut the fuck up</p>
<p>let me tell you something everyone&rsquo;s fucked</p>
<p>up don&rsquo;t you tell me that gays are less repressed</p>
<p>course you more repress society represses gay sex</p>
<p>gays are just as fucked up</p>
<p>as religion</p>
<p>repressing straight</p>
<p>sex and a lot of gays grew up in religious</p>
<p>households too</p>
<p>and that makes them</p>
<p>extra fucked up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a coincidence that gay people</p>
<p>do so much crystal math and there&rsquo;s so many gay people</p>
<p>that love to party and</p>
<p>their lives become a reckoning</p>
<p>fucking towards</p>
<p>their immune system</p>
<p>gay people there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>crazy fucking gay people and</p>
<p>not repressed</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always mean that you&rsquo;re not fucked up</p>
<p>i mean how about bug chasers how</p>
<p>about gay dudes that are purposely trying to get aids</p>
<p>you know that you</p>
<p>gay dudes who</p>
<p>purposely try to get hiv they want to get it</p>
<p>they think there&rsquo;s something hot</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>so they go and have unprotected sex on purpose</p>
<p>hoping to get hiv</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>gay people are less fucked up</p>
<p>sexually than straight people everyone&rsquo;s fucked humans</p>
<p>across the board</p>
<p>universally</p>
<p>are fucked up it&rsquo;s just way too difficult to come out</p>
<p>and have your shit together</p>
<p>i mean how many people like really have a shit together</p>
<p>if you had a</p>
<p>guess the numbers</p>
<p>one really has</p>
<p>no but i mean</p>
<p>have your shit together to a</p>
<p>point where you know like oh he&rsquo;s not doing anything</p>
<p>self destructive</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s being productive and positive it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>maybe one out of a hundred man</p>
<p>maybe out of the people that you meet</p>
<p>one out of a hundred the other ninety nine are nuts</p>
<p>you know half nuts</p>
<p>partially nuts you&rsquo;re nuts i&rsquo;m nuts we&rsquo;re both nuts</p>

<p>mouth gets infected</p>
<p>like if you have the</p>
<p>human papilloma</p>

<p>virus from eating pussy</p>

<p>tattoo artist</p>
<p>while he tells the</p>
<p>story i&rsquo;m gonna pee</p>
<p>one of my employees wanted to be a</p>
<p>tattoo artist and she</p>
<p>her boyfriend owned a tattoo studio</p>
<p>so the whole time</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like you know he&rsquo;s teaching me</p>
<p>every day how to do tattoos and i do it on like</p>
<p>watermelons or something</p>
<p>like that to practice and she&rsquo;s been doing it forever</p>
<p>and finally one day she&rsquo;s like you know what i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>tattoos now</p>
<p>so if you know anyone that needs a tattoo</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll hook them up and i go wow how much are you</p>
<p>charging and she&rsquo;s like for you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do it for free or something like that</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ll be my</p>
<p>first person to ever do it</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>thinking free tattoo</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>so i went there it took her</p>
<p>eight hours or something ridiculous</p>
<p>to do this tattoo</p>
<p>and it originally was supposed to be an</p>
<p>egyptian turtle</p>
<p>with my name on</p>
<p>in chinese or the letter r in chinese</p>
<p>in the middle of the turtle</p>
<p>in chinese it was some</p>
<p>stupid i was really</p>
<p>stoned or whatever</p>
<p>and it hurts so bad she did nothing but scar me</p>
<p>so i have tons of</p>
<p>scar tissue</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like the gayest looking</p>
<p>tattoo it looks like spider man</p>
<p>was in a gang</p>
<p>gang fight or something i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>anyways so anyways</p>
<p>so one time i&rsquo;m at this bar and</p>
<p>this chinese girl goes let me see that tattoo</p>
<p>and she goes</p>
<p>why do you have that on your arms</p>
<p>did she really talk like that</p>
<p>it was worse than that she had a cock in her mouth but</p>
<p>she looked at</p>
<p>it and she goes let me see that and she goes why do</p>
<p>you have that on your arm i&rsquo;m like what are you talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s an r in chinese my last name blah blah</p>
<p>blah she goes that&rsquo;s not an r she&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>flowing water that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>waterfall do you like</p>
<p>waterfalls so i guess my</p>
<p>tattoo means</p>
<p>water let me see it</p>

<p>anyway what the fuck were we talking about tattoos no</p>
<p>something doing cocaine in the bathroom oh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never done any coke i&rsquo;ve never done coke any ever</p>
<p>because when i was in high school</p>
<p>my friend jimmy his cousin</p>
<p>was selling coke</p>
<p>sitting said my friend who</p>
<p>let you fucking guess</p>
<p>but he was selling it and</p>
<p>when he was</p>
<p>doing that he lost all this weight and he fucking</p>
<p>he would like hide</p>
<p>in the basement or in the attic rather and just they</p>
<p>would do coke and</p>
<p>watch tv and him and his</p>
<p>girlfriend were just zombies</p>
<p>and i saw his</p>
<p>whole life fall</p>
<p>apart like i</p>
<p>watched it happen and</p>
<p>i remember like saying that fucking stops bad for you</p>
<p>i just remember</p>
<p>nothing but bad things</p>
<p>from high school</p>
<p>and and you know</p>
<p>right after high</p>
<p>school of people and coke</p>
<p>just like i</p>
<p>just was very obvious to me the coke is like the</p>
<p>worst thing you</p>
<p>could do here</p>
<p>de nitrous no</p>
<p>oh like from</p>
<p>whippets yeah i did it once once when i worked at a</p>
<p>ice cream place</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t like it just give me a headache</p>
<p>we used to go i&rsquo;ve done mdma</p>
<p>so guy asked me if i done it i did ecstasy once</p>
<p>only one time and it was awesome</p>
<p>but the next day was so bad</p>
<p>the next day i was so stupid my brain was like</p>
<p>it felt like a sponge that had been just wrung out</p>
<p>dry and then just left in the sun</p>
<p>you know and then you try to</p>
<p>like clean something with it it was just like</p>
<p>it was so my brain was so dumb it just</p>
<p>i was feeling so bad the next day</p>
<p>i was like this cannot be good for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be fucking terrible for you</p>
<p>who knows what it was in it though</p>
<p>it might not have just been</p>
<p>mdma pure mdma it</p>
<p>might have been like they say that people cut it with</p>
<p>speed and shit like that you know</p>
<p>but anyway yeah i couldn&rsquo;t read the next day that guy</p>
<p>bring rem show</p>
<p>gallery rem</p>
<p>shoe gallery</p>
<p>yeah i couldn&rsquo;t read the next day man</p>
<p>literally i was sitting in</p>
<p>a starbucks and i was trying to read</p>
<p>a magazine and</p>
<p>i was like i can&rsquo;t even fucking concentrate on this</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t literally couldn&rsquo;t focus</p>
<p>it was it was bad</p>
<p>it was a fucking</p>
<p>great time though that</p>
<p>night i can</p>
<p>understand why people do it</p>
<p>and i guess if you&rsquo;re not a big reader</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t mind feeling stupid</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem but for me man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked to people who say this</p>
<p>no the next</p>
<p>day they feel fine it just depends how much like</p>
<p>strict nines in it and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>candy flipped</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a piece of</p>
<p>candy and has</p>
<p>ecstasy on one side and acid</p>
<p>on the other side</p>
<p>i heard that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy though it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great combo</p>
<p>yeah yeah but i</p>
<p>heard it&rsquo;s like whenever you combine</p>
<p>things like that the recovery time just</p>
<p>accelerated</p>
<p>oh man it&rsquo;s even more time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll enjoy it nowadays</p>

<p>could totally see that guy doing it</p>
<p>adam hawthorne i think</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>about california is the fact that you get to</p>
<p>go these places and experience</p>

<p>with joey diaz mixes it up every day he</p>
<p>thinks that that&rsquo;s a</p>

<p>joey diaz thinks that he</p>
<p>should mix you wheat up</p>
<p>every day we&rsquo;re on guru tattoo dot com guru tattoo</p>

<p>smoke the same weed every day you get used to it</p>

<p>front of the show</p>
<p>that said warning the show will</p>
<p>contain language</p>
<p>and material</p>
<p>as extreme as you</p>
<p>could possibly imagine</p>
<p>but apparently</p>
<p>some of the shit i said people couldn&rsquo;t imagine so</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know what to expect but</p>
<p>sorry you got bummed out but</p>
<p>99 of people had a</p>
<p>great fucking time but yeah it was pretty wild</p>
<p>crazy show but also</p>
<p>it was because we were hammered that</p>
<p>night too so two</p>
<p>nights in a row we got barbecued</p>
<p>so i was planning</p>
<p>on going to australia</p>
<p>and doing all this writing</p>
<p>but alcohol just</p>
<p>sticks a fork and all</p>
<p>those plans you know</p>

<p>that when you flew to australia it was like 17 hours</p>

<p>you had like</p>
<p>like small little bedrooms almost on the</p>
<p>plane right</p>
<p>plane was dope</p>
<p>we flew first</p>
<p>class on qantas and then some i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called the a310 or something like that</p>
<p>giant ass fucking plane</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re huge man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little</p>
<p>apartment man</p>
<p>was like coach like like</p>

<p>close to it but</p>
<p>coach fuck you they say</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t tax yeah go</p>
<p>on i&rsquo;ve been like hey let me hang out in your bedroom</p>
<p>my man i can&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>flying 16 hours in one of</p>
<p>these ass chairs just</p>
<p>jam next to</p>
<p>ralphime on one side and</p>
<p>kevin smith on the other</p>
<p>after they ran</p>
<p>a marathon i can&rsquo;t believe that somebody kicked</p>
<p>kevin smith off his fucking</p>
<p>how dumb are you it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>do you not know who i</p>
<p>guess a lot of people don&rsquo;t know who he is with</p>
<p>like the way he looks</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s oh that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>famous director</p>
<p>you might want to shut</p>
<p>the fuck up that guy&rsquo;s on twitter all day every day</p>
<p>he probably ruined southwest</p>
<p>that cost them</p>
<p>money for sure</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>well part of me</p>
<p>thinks so but then the</p>
<p>other part of</p>
<p>me is like they just got so much attention</p>
<p>you know especially if you hate fat people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like fuck yeah i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>southwest so</p>
<p>they lost the fat dollar</p>
<p>i bet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of fat people got bummed out how does</p>
<p>ralphie may fly</p>
<p>southwest because</p>
<p>you know how much</p>
<p>money that probably</p>
<p>saved him all</p>
<p>these pissed off fat people that aren&rsquo;t flying</p>
<p>southwest now just save them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already studies that they were</p>
<p>thinking this is ridiculous</p>
<p>they were thinking</p>
<p>about making you take a shit</p>
<p>before you flew</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>found out that if they made everyone go to</p>
<p>the bathroom before they got on the airplane that they</p>
<p>would save so many dollars per year</p>
<p>like this was a real</p>
<p>study that they were</p>
<p>going to do is</p>
<p>it southwest</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>southwest it was american airlines or something</p>
<p>like that oh my</p>
<p>god so can you imagine</p>
<p>now that they have all</p>
<p>these fat people pissed off that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna fly</p>
<p>southwest it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>earning 5 million dollars a year i</p>
<p>wonder how much it cost them more</p>
<p>to fly like fuel</p>
<p>wise to australia for a fat guy than for like a small</p>
<p>guy oh i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s big enough times</p>
<p>100 than you</p>
<p>would imagine my god you know</p>
<p>huh yeah it kind of makes</p>
<p>sense maybe</p>
<p>southwest paid</p>
<p>kevin smith in this is</p>
<p>all just to save them a million a couple million a year</p>
<p>kevin smith</p>
<p>would never do that it&rsquo;s like the fact that</p>
<p>kevin smith</p>
<p>has integrity</p>

<p>nor mcdonald goes he goes</p>
<p>well what fucking difference does it</p>
<p>make what time he&rsquo;s on anyway</p>

<p>12 30 is better</p>
<p>you can get away with more shit</p>
<p>he was totally right</p>
<p>i like how he&rsquo;s saying all this but yeah his</p>
<p>phone was from</p>
<p>nineteen eighty two so i was like you know</p>
<p>the fact that he had a</p>
<p>phone at all</p>
<p>when i when i ran into</p>
<p>him i ran into norm</p>
<p>mcdonald once when i was doing some canadian gigs like</p>
<p>a couple of years ago</p>
<p>and when i ran into him he didn&rsquo;t have a cell</p>
<p>phone i had to call his home</p>
<p>phone that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it never fucking cell phone</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have one</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t want people to just</p>
<p>be able to get in</p>
<p>touch with me</p>
<p>sometimes i just</p>
<p>wanna fuck off and disappear</p>
<p>i love that dude</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s hilarious man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>norm mcdonald the host in a talk show</p>
<p>would be the shit yeah</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>i would tune into that talk show</p>
<p>because he wouldn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>get people get away with anything</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s nuts you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a loose dude he&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>he would be a good</p>
<p>couch guy for like conan</p>
<p>cause have you ever seen him on the</p>
<p>couch with like</p>
<p>i forget who it was</p>
<p>the whole time he was like kraken joe yeah</p>
<p>that was awesome wasn&rsquo;t he yeah</p>
<p>he would be a good like</p>
<p>a good side guy yeah</p>
<p>and you know i have like a straight guy</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s the side guy yeah</p>
<p>what is my take on the weed</p>
<p>stores in la getting raided</p>
<p>it fucking sucks</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>whole thing makes me makes me sick</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>whole thing is so</p>
<p>so strange man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so strange that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still fucking with people</p>
<p>apparently the way the law is presented though in</p>
<p>california and i&rsquo;m not sure of this</p>
<p>is that they believe</p>
<p>that the way the law is presented is that you can</p>
<p>give weed away</p>
<p>and you can</p>
<p>sell it as long as you&rsquo;re not making a profit</p>
<p>and that these</p>
<p>collectives are supposed to be to provide</p>
<p>medical patients with marijuana but</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s people out there that are</p>
<p>flaunting the wealth and they&rsquo;re making a fuckload of</p>
<p>money off of it</p>
<p>millions and millions of dollars off selling weed</p>
<p>now if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two parts of me</p>
<p>one part of</p>
<p>me that says well you know what fuck you they</p>
<p>should be able to sell it</p>
<p>you guys are douchebags</p>
<p>but another part of me says hmm</p>
<p>maybe be better</p>
<p>maybe would be really in the</p>
<p>spirit of weed if it was free</p>
<p>maybe you really</p>
<p>would be in the</p>
<p>spirit of weed that it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t for profit</p>
<p>you know people will well</p>
<p>down man these</p>
<p>stores couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist and they couldn&rsquo;t sell it</p>
<p>yeah but weeds not that hard to grow man people would</p>
<p>still grow and sell weed</p>
<p>and you know people</p>
<p>would sell it illegally i mean there</p>
<p>would be plenty of people that would</p>
<p>you know if you want good</p>
<p>weed you got to talk to this guy and it&rsquo;s expensive</p>
<p>but i kind of like the idea of it not being for profit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it that</p>
<p>that bugs me that people are overcharging for this</p>
<p>plant just because it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>it means fucking</p>
<p>some places it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super expensive you know</p>
<p>five six hundred dollars an</p>
<p>ounce for like really</p>
<p>powerful potent weed</p>
<p>you know which i</p>
<p>understand the guy</p>
<p>should get paid for his growing and this and that</p>
<p>and i totally respect that</p>
<p>you should be able to make a certain amount of</p>
<p>money for it but</p>
<p>if it was legal</p>
<p>it would be way fucking</p>
<p>cheaper than it is</p>
<p>right now the reality is</p>
<p>the reason why it&rsquo;s expensive at all the reason why</p>
<p>these guys can make</p>
<p>millions of dollars and profit off of selling wheat</p>
<p>is only because it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>and difficult to get and you have to get it from</p>
<p>these places</p>
<p>if marijuana was</p>
<p>legal and you</p>
<p>could grow your own</p>
<p>which is how it should be</p>
<p>you have no need to buy it</p>
<p>you could have a little fucking</p>
<p>plant in your backyard</p>
<p>it pretty much</p>
<p>already is like that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not this guy got fucking arrested it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>this guy just got arrested</p>
<p>this guy just got arrested with 24 different counts</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna trust him</p>
<p>and the way it works</p>
<p>apparently is what</p>
<p>obama has said is that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna charge people</p>
<p>who are who are</p>
<p>only violating federal law cause</p>
<p>federally it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>after people who gonna</p>
<p>violate both federal and state laws</p>
<p>so you have to follow the</p>
<p>state law to the letter</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making an example of this one dude</p>
<p>apparently well i mean if you go and get a license</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to grow what seven</p>
<p>plants or something like that</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to grow a lot you&rsquo;re allowed to have like a half a</p>
<p>pound of weed yeah</p>
<p>you could even</p>
<p>get the other</p>
<p>license that you can do up to like 21</p>
<p>plants yes i got that yeah you have that for some</p>
<p>weird reason</p>
<p>they asked me if i</p>
<p>need an exemption</p>
<p>and i said what&rsquo;s in the exemption</p>
<p>for he goes well you</p>
<p>know the regular amount of weed is not enough i go yes</p>
<p>the regular amount is not enough</p>
<p>i need more so</p>
<p>you could pretty much anyone can get that</p>
<p>even kids could probably get this shit</p>
<p>but if they can get that</p>
<p>license so if you</p>
<p>could just grow within your amount you</p>
<p>could pretty much</p>
<p>do that now and even if the cops came over your house</p>
<p>right but it</p>
<p>could be people that don&rsquo;t have the room to grow and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to be hassled and they want to</p>
<p>be able to go out and purchase it at a reasonable rate</p>
<p>and i agree</p>
<p>there is a reasonable rate but</p>
<p>right now the rate is so high that marijuana is</p>
<p>worth more than gold</p>
<p>marijuana is</p>
<p>worth more per</p>
<p>pound than gold is that seems a little crazy</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely inflated because of the fact that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no competition because of the fact that it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fucking plan</p>
<p>it should be</p>
<p>legal everybody</p>
<p>should be able to grow it if it was</p>
<p>legal there</p>
<p>would be nobody making millions</p>
<p>and millions of dollars off it the real problem is</p>
<p>it would fuck the economy up</p>
<p>because pharmaceutical</p>
<p>companies would just fucking nosedive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be so many different</p>
<p>pharmaceutical products</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>they would be useless</p>
<p>do you know i believe that to a point but</p>
<p>right now i have weed whenever i want have we but i</p>
<p>still have tums for my stomach i</p>
<p>still have aspirin</p>
<p>for headaches you know they didn&rsquo;t replace any of that</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t have fucking glaucoma dude you</p>
<p>oh yeah you have there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>medications for add</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>those are the billion dollar medicines</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not tums bro</p>
<p>but you know what prescription</p>
<p>most of these people that</p>
<p>are saying that it&rsquo;s the best drug for glaucoma and</p>
<p>stuff are just hippies wanting weed to be</p>
<p>legal because if you look at them the</p>
<p>medication for</p>
<p>glaucoma in comparison</p>
<p>i bet you it&rsquo;s better than</p>
<p>weeds no it&rsquo;s not you</p>
<p>know marijuana is the best for</p>
<p>interocular</p>
<p>pressure i believe that it&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>when glaucoma</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s very painful for people</p>
<p>and marijuana</p>
<p>apparently is the best at relieving that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best at</p>
<p>restoring people&rsquo;s appetite when they have chemotherapy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why cancer patients like it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best at</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best that a lot of different</p>
<p>things do there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that have had kids that have autism</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video that we showed and we</p>
<p>made that clip</p>
<p>the kid that had autism and</p>
<p>it was the only</p>
<p>thing that calmed</p>
<p>the kid down and made him normal was weed</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for a lot of different</p>
<p>things and all</p>
<p>those different</p>
<p>things are prescription drugs</p>
<p>that are worth</p>
<p>fucking billions of dollars</p>
<p>every year to</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>which is why</p>
<p>they lobby against</p>
<p>recreational drugs</p>
<p>so called recreational drugs</p>
<p>which is why to this day</p>
<p>partnership for a drug free america to this day</p>
<p>gets money from</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>they got money from alcohol companies and tobacco</p>
<p>companies millions and millions of dollars in the past</p>
<p>and because of that there was a lot of criticism</p>
<p>so they no longer get</p>
<p>money from alcohol and tobacco companies but they</p>
<p>still get money from fucking</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies are responsible for</p>
<p>oxycodone vicodin</p>
<p>percocet all that shit i</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be like if they</p>
<p>made it legal</p>
<p>like all these</p>
<p>companies are</p>
<p>gonna go out of business</p>
<p>i know my mom&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be smoking weed she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like no i&rsquo;ll take the</p>
<p>other thing</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>would be dumb enough for a few</p>
<p>generations yeah they</p>
<p>would be dumb enough well there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>people that we just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work with</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>50 60 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to</p>
<p>change for the</p>
<p>things that we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s not 50 or 60</p>
<p>weed is a real effective</p>
<p>medicine for a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things yeah but</p>
<p>more importantly it</p>
<p>would be great for textiles</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>great for you</p>
<p>could eat it</p>
<p>i mean it has all the essential</p>
<p>fatty acids and the seeds</p>
<p>no amino acids</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different fucking</p>
<p>things that marijuana is good for besides just</p>
<p>just getting you high</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s incredible that it&rsquo;s illegal it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>mind blowing that it&rsquo;s illegal that in two thousand ten</p>
<p>with the access to information that we have</p>
<p>today the fact that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still illegal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking insane man</p>
<p>you stream laggy yeah you</p>
<p>streams always lagging man anything on</p>
<p>the internet&rsquo;s laggy nothing works perfect this fucking</p>
<p>the internet is in a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a stage</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s not done yet</p>
<p>the irs plane</p>
<p>crasher guy having a hangar</p>
<p>co leased by member of homeland security and having</p>
<p>ties to intelligence agencies</p>
<p>is that true</p>
<p>well i know that he</p>
<p>stole that plane so i don&rsquo;t know it wasn&rsquo;t his</p>
<p>plane if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about oh really</p>
<p>but you know what i&rsquo;m all for that guy because what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all for that guy that</p>
<p>crashed his</p>
<p>building his</p>
<p>plane did anyone die in that yes</p>

<p>right i&rsquo;m sorry i was just working</p>
<p>but fuck the irs</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;m still dealing with that bullshit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like fucking</p>
<p>okay this bad</p>
<p>bad bobby&rsquo;s telling me that gold is one thousand</p>
<p>one hundred dollars an ounce</p>
<p>in british columbia and</p>
<p>the best weed is</p>
<p>three thousand</p>
<p>two hundred dollars a pound</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t more than gold</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going for less than 17 000 a</p>
<p>pound here in the us oh i</p>
<p>stand corrected</p>
<p>thank you very much sir</p>
<p>sounds better</p>
<p>yeah i know what&rsquo;s worth more than gold cash</p>
<p>hash is worth more than gold isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>damn hash is expensive as fuck</p>
<p>how much is a pound of hash go for</p>
<p>more than pound a hash hot but a</p>
<p>hash go fucking</p>
<p>punch a hole through to another dimension</p>
<p>imagine we smoked a pound of hash</p>
<p>hash they make out of weed somehow another and</p>
<p>then the resident they do it the resin</p>
<p>how do they do it though do you know how they make it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t sound sort of a complicated process</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve had it before and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strange high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very very i miss very</p>
<p>strong i&rsquo;m gonna do opium again</p>
<p>opium is awesome you did opium</p>
<p>fuck yeah it&rsquo;s not much different than ash</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>it looks if i listen</p>
<p>a little like opia so now heroin</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it looks like a piece of soap it</p>
<p>smokes like hash and it smells like a hippie</p>
<p>like patchouli</p>
<p>it smells like patchouli when it burns really yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like a hash kind of feeling</p>
<p>hmm i&rsquo;m scared man</p>
<p>yeah the the gold</p>
<p>thing i didn&rsquo;t really research that very well</p>
<p>it was something else</p>
<p>sorry i said that incorrectly there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>that that marijuana was more expensive than</p>
<p>per ounce it was oil</p>
<p>does that make sense</p>
<p>worth more than oil</p>
<p>worth more than something that&rsquo;s worth a lot</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go with some other questions here</p>
<p>damn with the you stream</p>
<p>powerful you stream</p>
<p>opium smells like flowers and is super addictive</p>
<p>from the poppy</p>
<p>there faggot why you doing something super addictive</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s already did</p>
<p>not addict brian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cat had a hangnail and that got him start smoking again</p>

<p>before that it was your cat got to hang me on</p>
<p>no it was my cat had a fucked up foot</p>
<p>kind of fucked up</p>
<p>his cat fucked up fucking</p>
<p>fucking can&rsquo;t take anymore dude</p>
<p>cigarettes are the worst because</p>
<p>cigarettes out of nowhere you&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>dude i need a cigarette i need a</p>
<p>cigarette it&rsquo;s one of those things once you do it</p>
<p>it opens up a door that&rsquo;s always gonna be open</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s weird cigarettes look this guy</p>
<p>did you know you can activate your pineal</p>
<p>by saying the word love at a certain frequency shut up</p>
<p>shut the fuck up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that shut up like the new mariah carey song</p>
<p>has a high enough pitch to open up your garage doors</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t fuck up</p>
<p>people love to say stupid shit</p>
<p>people love fucking magic</p>
<p>they love magic and nonsense</p>
<p>you know they love to</p>
<p>think that there is like something like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s real magic</p>
<p>real magic eat a</p>
<p>pound of mushrooms you wanna see something magic</p>
<p>instead of having a 16 ounce steak</p>
<p>have 16 ounces of mushrooms motherfucker</p>
<p>boom that&rsquo;s magic you know yeah you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>magically be retarded for the rest of your life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably be communicating with</p>
<p>aliens permanently you&rsquo;ll probably be</p>
<p>locked into another dimension you know</p>
<p>tell jerry garcia smoking opium wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>addictive he</p>
<p>moved to smoking</p>
<p>black tar heroin</p>
<p>after that well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for sure</p>
<p>they used to have</p>
<p>opium dens back in the wild west don&rsquo;t you remember but</p>
<p>i never once did opium</p>
<p>the next day thought</p>
<p>about oh my god i need it</p>
<p>you know it was</p>
<p>never like that</p>
<p>cocaine was kind of like that but for me</p>
<p>but i hope it</p>
<p>never was like that that was more of like a</p>
<p>treat like a dessert</p>
<p>well you know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good argument because this argument was on the message</p>
<p>board as well people were talking</p>
<p>about things being addictive and</p>
<p>the problem with even alcohol</p>
<p>being addictive is that it&rsquo;s not addictive to everybody</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m not addicted to alcohol</p>
<p>i could not have a</p>
<p>drink every day for</p>
<p>the rest of my life and i&rsquo;d have no problem with that</p>
<p>but i like to have a</p>
<p>drink sometimes and go on stage</p>
<p>i like to have</p>
<p>a drink sometimes my buddies just to make</p>
<p>things fun just makes you get</p>
<p>crazy you pay for it the next day though</p>
<p>especially our</p>
<p>age yeah yeah man you get</p>
<p>older do you pay for it more</p>
<p>but the bottom line is it&rsquo;s not addictive like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>when i don&rsquo;t have it but for some people it is yeah</p>
<p>some people have to have a drink</p>
<p>when i was doing construction when i was a kid</p>
<p>there was a dude who had a mountain dew bottle</p>
<p>and he would fill it up with fucking beer</p>
<p>like cheap beer like colt forty five</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>drink beer all day</p>
<p>while we worked all day this guy was</p>
<p>he was shaky</p>
<p>jones and dude he</p>
<p>would show up for work though</p>
<p>he was there</p>
<p>every fucking day</p>
<p>seven in the morning</p>
<p>swinging that hammer</p>
<p>you know he was there</p>
<p>pissing every five minutes</p>
<p>that was always hammered though</p>
<p>he was drinking beer all day</p>
<p>for that dude though</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own biochemical makeup</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re addicted to cigarettes</p>
<p>but like tom segura</p>
<p>tom segura smokes</p>
<p>cigarettes when he drinks</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke other times</p>
<p>and he can go years without</p>
<p>cigarettes so no problem</p>
<p>but when he</p>
<p>drinks he likes to have a cigarette</p>
<p>when was last</p>
<p>time he went a year with no problem now</p>
<p>well he said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s taking a long time off he&rsquo;s taking time off a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>and he won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke for months</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;ll have a cigarette</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>cigarette when he drinks</p>
<p>i definitely</p>
<p>think cigarettes is like that one thing that</p>
<p>even if you quit smoking</p>
<p>it can be three years</p>
<p>later in out of nowhere you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start smoking again</p>
<p>no reason why no you&rsquo;ve said that and so is ari so</p>
<p>i think you know i think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing something remember that</p>
<p>movie the insider with</p>
<p>russell crowe</p>
<p>you see that</p>
<p>movie it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about like all the shit that they do to</p>
<p>cigarettes to make it even</p>
<p>more addictive like hundreds of difference of additives</p>
<p>hundreds of</p>
<p>different additives just to make it more addictive</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve totally believe that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>totally 100</p>
<p>believe that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>man i mean who the fuck knows</p>
<p>i mean they say that</p>
<p>cigarettes are more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as dangerous as heroin</p>
<p>cause heroin will kill you</p>
<p>quicker and you can overdose from it but</p>
<p>cigarettes will get you hooked</p>
<p>quicker than anything yeah</p>
<p>apparently if you if you have that</p>
<p>thing inside you that gets you hooked to shit</p>
<p>like most i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but i cigarettes</p>
<p>totally different</p>
<p>totally with cocaine too you said</p>
<p>well i almost</p>
<p>cause i was selling it and getting a</p>
<p>large amounts of it for free</p>
<p>you were allegedly</p>
<p>allegedly selling not really selling it not really</p>
<p>selling it this is like a character that</p>
<p>would buy a</p>
<p>large amount</p>
<p>so he could give it away</p>
<p>and have some</p>
<p>extra for free it was</p>
<p>peter pan of</p>
<p>no not peter pan</p>
<p>robin hood of cocaine</p>
<p>it was like one</p>
<p>month of my life back in 90</p>
<p>or in this fictional</p>
<p>story in his fictional story</p>
<p>but anyways</p>
<p>if you but if you were rich</p>
<p>okay what if you were like i was rich</p>
<p>i was getting rich</p>
<p>what if you were like jay z baller</p>
<p>you know private jet rich and you</p>
<p>could just get pure cocaine</p>
<p>shipped right over here from the cia</p>
<p>the cia would drop it off on your doorstep</p>
<p>well i think i like mr michael</p>
<p>package of cocaine</p>
<p>i think the only reason</p>
<p>it was kind of addictive to me because i am one of</p>
<p>those people that</p>
<p>never go to</p>
<p>the doctors and i probably need to be one of</p>
<p>those people that are on</p>
<p>speed or something because i</p>
<p>like having a thyroid</p>
<p>i like having a thyroid condition most of my day is</p>
<p>spent like moping around no energy</p>
<p>and stuff like that but</p>
<p>when cocaine</p>
<p>i felt like i was</p>
<p>alive for the</p>
<p>first time oh</p>
<p>my god and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what was addictive more of just like</p>
<p>i felt like i was out of some kind of coma</p>
<p>well sometimes yeah well sometimes i&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>like a normal day like i&rsquo;m not really into anything</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll have a cup of coffee and god</p>
<p>damn it fucking</p>
<p>fired up i feel</p>
<p>great yeah i feel good about life</p>
<p>right fucking feels like the warm sun feels better</p>
<p>i want to clean my office</p>
<p>you get a little</p>
<p>fired up from</p>
<p>stimulants you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there for</p>
<p>yeah you know cook it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what cocaine&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but i know that i&rsquo;ve had you</p>
<p>would never stop talking ever you talk</p>
<p>about this how</p>
<p>would you do that</p>
<p>you would be talking so fast your jaw would</p>
<p>fly off and hit somebody in the face i have this</p>
<p>thing called</p>
<p>matte decoca</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a tea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made out of</p>
<p>i guess i&rsquo;m talking to myself from now</p>
<p>on talking to</p>
<p>you mati de</p>
<p>cocoa is a tea that&rsquo;s made out of cocoa</p>
<p>leaves so it&rsquo;s like cocaine</p>
<p>the plant that they make cocaine</p>
<p>from but it&rsquo;s the unprocessed form which is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually like indigenous people</p>
<p>chew that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s in peru they said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like really common isn&rsquo;t it peru</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s outside smoking cigarettes</p>
<p>talking to myself</p>
<p>they they chew this leaf</p>
<p>and some for</p>
<p>especially people that</p>
<p>are at high altitude</p>
<p>like high altitude</p>
<p>herding communities they</p>
<p>they eat this they chew this tea</p>
<p>this tea leaf</p>
<p>but i had it in a tea form</p>
<p>and when i had it it was</p>
<p>not good for me</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t shut</p>
<p>the fuck up me and doug stanhope were doing shrooms</p>
<p>it was the day the iraq war started</p>
<p>and we were</p>
<p>in the middle of the desert at my friend yan&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shrooming and</p>
<p>right when the shrooms were kicking in</p>
<p>we noticed on the</p>
<p>television set that</p>
<p>they were saying that the war coverage</p>
<p>begins at five</p>
<p>and stanhope</p>
<p>looked at me and he goes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking kickoff for the war</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what it was like they were telling us when the war</p>
<p>coverage is gonna</p>
<p>start tune in at five or war coverage</p>
<p>it was like a kickoff</p>
<p>it was like that&rsquo;s when the program the war program was</p>
<p>gonna start</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>this guy yawn my friend yawn who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done more</p>
<p>psychedelics than anyone i&rsquo;ve ever met ever he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely probably</p>
<p>fried his brain he&rsquo;s got a cool podcast though</p>
<p>but he was talking</p>
<p>about hey take this</p>
<p>matte to coco it&rsquo;ll help the mushrooms kick in quicker</p>
<p>maybe it did</p>
<p>but i could not shut the fuck up</p>
<p>and i was telling doug</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>doing it i was like i can&rsquo;t shut the fuck up</p>
<p>this has drive me</p>
<p>crazy and he was</p>
<p>laughing uncontrollably</p>
<p>cause he thought it was hilarious that i was</p>
<p>talking about how i couldn&rsquo;t shut the fuck up yet</p>
<p>aware of it and</p>
<p>still talking it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst but you know what you would</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those drugs that</p>
<p>thank god you</p>
<p>never tried</p>
<p>cause you would</p>
<p>freak out and love it because</p>
<p>it makes your mind open up</p>
<p>and just think so</p>
<p>clear because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just non stop</p>
<p>thinking of new</p>
<p>stuff to talk</p>
<p>about well that&rsquo;s for me my</p>
<p>friend my friend</p>
<p>jimmy said that when we were kids</p>
<p>we had the cousin that was</p>
<p>had the problem with it</p>
<p>he told me not to do it he</p>
<p>told you smell so bad dude</p>
<p>that is so nasty</p>
<p>cigarettes are so they are nasty</p>
<p>but you kept on talking</p>
<p>about him and</p>
<p>daddy needed a taste oh</p>
<p>daddy needed a</p>
<p>taste you can&rsquo;t go two</p>
<p>hours without</p>
<p>he had a cigarette</p>
<p>right when we</p>
<p>started too by the way</p>
<p>oh shut your fucking hole</p>
<p>you had your fix</p>
<p>had your goddamn fix</p>
<p>um anyway cigarettes</p>
<p>bad okay okay</p>
<p>very bad okay</p>
<p>you know what though</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting in</p>
<p>california i don&rsquo;t know if this is in all</p>
<p>states that they have changed cigarettes</p>
<p>to go out by themselves</p>
<p>now so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t hit it long enough</p>
<p>it will just go out because of the fires out here</p>
<p>so cigarette companies had to make something</p>
<p>in the cigarette</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t hit it</p>
<p>after a while it will go out by itself</p>
<p>and just makes me what is that yeah that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>good they probably doing something like that man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve probably made it</p>
<p>extra addictive</p>
<p>along the way</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>well we can do that</p>
<p>but unfortunately</p>
<p>causes psychotic episodes</p>
<p>to make you fucking mortgage your</p>
<p>house for extra</p>
<p>cigarettes might</p>
<p>start hoarding cigarettes</p>
<p>you know if they</p>
<p>could figure out a way</p>
<p>to put something in</p>
<p>cigarettes that</p>
<p>would make you</p>
<p>completely insane and have this</p>
<p>insane desire to collect cigarettes</p>
<p>could you imagine if that</p>
<p>started happening you know like</p>
<p>a lot of black dudes collect</p>
<p>sneakers like</p>
<p>you go into</p>
<p>their house i got you</p>
<p>mtv wraps or</p>
<p>mtv cribs rather</p>
<p>you know you go in they have like a</p>
<p>whole room filled with</p>
<p>sneakers hiding</p>
<p>their junk from somebody</p>
<p>their junk was touched</p>
<p>towards the mountain</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too big and they</p>
<p>think they have a</p>
<p>horse cock so they want you</p>
<p>to look at their</p>
<p>shoes what the fuck is he talking</p>
<p>about he&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>chicks no what no</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>for whatever reason they&rsquo;re into collecting</p>
<p>shoes what if</p>
<p>people just</p>
<p>started collecting cigarettes</p>
<p>like hoarding</p>
<p>cigarettes like roomfuls of</p>
<p>cigarettes and</p>
<p>cigarette companies were like well</p>
<p>you know we make a fantastic product</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t help it if people get</p>
<p>excited about it they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>excited about our product</p>
<p>we found out that they had</p>
<p>added something to</p>
<p>cigarettes that make people want to hoard</p>
<p>cigarettes they</p>
<p>would totally do it</p>
<p>if some fucking scientist came up with</p>
<p>a formula where he</p>
<p>could have a certain amount of chemicals</p>
<p>and if you put</p>
<p>those in cigarettes and the people smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes they</p>
<p>would have this insatiable desire to collect cigarettes</p>
<p>and buy way more than they need</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think they</p>
<p>would put that in the cigarettes</p>
<p>of course they would</p>
<p>fuck yeah they</p>
<p>would do it they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about you they sell shit that kills you</p>
<p>they shit they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they didn&rsquo;t know we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>cigarettes kill you holy shit we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop we&rsquo;re sorry no</p>
<p>cigarettes kill 400</p>
<p>fucking million people every year</p>
<p>and no cigarette</p>
<p>companies even thought</p>
<p>about slowing down</p>
<p>and no politicians have ever thought</p>
<p>about banning them</p>
<p>you never hear a peep out of politicians</p>
<p>all those faggots</p>
<p>wanna talk about fucking banning pot and</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta stop marijuana and illegal drugs</p>
<p>meanwhile cigarettes are killing way more people than</p>
<p>everything else combined</p>
<p>cancer aids</p>
<p>fucking heroin meth coke</p>
<p>all that shit</p>
<p>pull it all together</p>
<p>with alcohol</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t put a fucking dent</p>
<p>not a scratch</p>
<p>into what cigarettes kill every year</p>
<p>if they can figure out a way to make you</p>
<p>wanna hoard</p>
<p>cigarettes for sure they</p>
<p>would do it</p>
<p>and the people hoarding it they</p>
<p>would give testimonials i don&rsquo;t have a problem with it</p>
<p>i enjoy my cigarette</p>
<p>collection when i walk</p>
<p>into the garage</p>
<p>and i look at all my i like the</p>
<p>smell i get out there and i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like i&rsquo;m smoking more i&rsquo;m smoking</p>
<p>three pots a day</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right they do do that with scars but</p>
<p>cigars are totally different</p>
<p>they like to savor the</p>
<p>taste and shit and it&rsquo;s like shit</p>
<p>makes no sense</p>
<p>to me different</p>
<p>no different</p>
<p>cigars are different flavors too they</p>
<p>taste different yeah but</p>
<p>they all taste like shit to me they</p>
<p>all taste like you&rsquo;re sucking on a fucking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>tree or something i like them</p>
<p>i like cigars i</p>
<p>think they taste good</p>
<p>really yeah when you have a fat</p>
<p>steak and a</p>
<p>glass of wine you get a nice cuban</p>
<p>cigar with a fucking good</p>
<p>taste to it</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just like you</p>
<p>you take it in you get a good</p>
<p>taste in your</p>
<p>mouth it&rsquo;s fun get you a little gives you a buzz</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>splits because you don&rsquo;t inhale</p>
<p>cigars you don&rsquo;t have to inhale</p>
<p>put it in your mouth</p>
<p>they do if you</p>
<p>gonna get high no</p>
<p>the science between</p>
<p>getting high is that once it hits your mouth it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>immediately in your</p>
<p>stream you don&rsquo;t even is that true</p>
<p>yeah they did</p>
<p>a study where it showed like people that used to</p>
<p>think where you&rsquo;re supposed to inhale it</p>
<p>and hold it in as long as you can</p>
<p>i guess supposedly you get 99</p>
<p>of the thc immediately</p>
<p>when you suck it</p>
<p>twitterverse is this true</p>
<p>because if this</p>
<p>is true i will stop smoking weed from now on</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll just put it in my mouth</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just put them off take a deep breath</p>
<p>and then blow it out i always</p>
<p>thought the people were doing that were like bill</p>
<p>i always thought that</p>
<p>bill clinton did not inhale</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because he was crafty</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know that he knows science he</p>
<p>knows is that real science it is science</p>
<p>of course is that</p>
<p>is that real science twitter verse</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>is that true</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s keep our</p>
<p>googling i love google we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna google</p>

<p>you need to</p>
<p>fully inhale it to get high</p>
<p>take a big breath in see</p>
<p>these are people like fucking</p>
<p>eighteen just like</p>
<p>you have to inhale weed in your</p>
<p>lungs get higher won&rsquo;t do anything weed does not</p>
<p>cause cancer okay this guy&rsquo;s got a cancer article</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about cancer you fuck</p>
<p>all right we have no correct answer</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen we tried</p>
<p>we cannot find the answer to this</p>
<p>yahoo answers are all written by sixteen year olds or</p>
<p>forty year old retards one or the other</p>
<p>this guy says he knows everything about candace</p>
<p>more in seven</p>
<p>seconds are these good yahoo answers yeah we looked at</p>
<p>those yahoo answers man that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something about your mouth is filled with</p>
<p>whatever the</p>
<p>makes sense because you don&rsquo;t inhale</p>
<p>tobacco smoke when you</p>
<p>smoke a cigar and you get high as fuck</p>
<p>you get really high from cigars</p>
<p>cigars give you like a serious</p>
<p>nicotine rush</p>
<p>like woo like a good one</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s if that happens</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t that happen with marijuana too</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t inhale the cigar</p>
<p>smoke you take it in your mouth</p>
<p>and then you blow it out you don&rsquo;t take a deep</p>
<p>hit of it like you do with cigarettes</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tough google search i&rsquo;ll have to just actually</p>
<p>find that yeah we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know ladies and gentlemen it was a recent</p>
<p>article that was about six months ago i read it</p>
<p>some people weed is not for them that really is true</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>stanhope doesn&rsquo;t like weed stanhope hates weed</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense because he likes everything else but i</p>
<p>think he probably got too high and he got paranoid</p>
<p>he got a high feeling</p>
<p>if you get too high we will fucking</p>
<p>rock your world man</p>
<p>shit makes you really</p>
<p>the last ufc i was at</p>
<p>i was tripping my ass off i almost had to run out i was</p>
<p>thinking like okay i am just gonna</p>
<p>leave and go to my room and take a nap</p>
<p>cause i was tripping too hard</p>
<p>from weed wow this is a</p>
<p>rivalry says opium trivia the term</p>
<p>are you hip</p>
<p>comes from opium dens</p>
<p>you would lay on your side on your hip and smoke</p>
<p>hence the term are you hip</p>
<p>that kind of makes</p>
<p>sense because if you ever watch like those old west</p>
<p>movies or dudes are doing heroin</p>
<p>there or opium</p>
<p>they are lying on their side yeah</p>
<p>like what was that movie were whiter</p>
<p>was it whiter</p>
<p>one of those movies buffalo bill or white herb</p>
<p>i think it was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember who the fuck played him</p>
<p>well remember</p>
<p>what was the movie were a doc holiday</p>
<p>the one with fucking</p>
<p>dennis quaid played</p>
<p>dennis quaid played</p>
<p>wide herb and</p>
<p>val kilmer played doc holiday</p>
<p>the dopest doc holiday</p>
<p>before val kilmer just</p>
<p>ate everything that that existed</p>
<p>val kilmer&rsquo;s all fat and fucked up now he was like</p>
<p>go back to top gun days</p>
<p>tim stone tombstone that&rsquo;s it we go back to like</p>
<p>val kilmer like the the old days falcon</p>
<p>was a handsome motherfucker</p>
<p>yeah yeah you</p>
<p>start hanging out with tom size one</p>
<p>you know this whole we thing we</p>
<p>could just fucking next time we&rsquo;re sober we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>try it yeah</p>
<p>okay look at this guy says red band is</p>
<p>right arrow it here we go robberies</p>
<p>comes comes clean</p>
<p>ah here we go</p>
<p>you do not read it to us</p>
<p>okay here it is</p>
<p>mouth smoking cannabis</p>
<p>one of the primary health issues with cannabis is the</p>
<p>effect of smoke on the lungs while the risks</p>
<p>from long term cannabis smoking are not</p>
<p>fully understood is assumed by mo</p>
<p>before i do this</p>
<p>i will tell</p>
<p>i will take this copy</p>
<p>mouth smoking is not as efficient as lung smoking</p>
<p>and requires approximately</p>
<p>three times the material</p>
<p>for the same</p>
<p>level of effect</p>
<p>but for some people</p>
<p>efficiency is not an issue</p>
<p>i would say it&rsquo;s not an issue</p>
<p>you know cause weeds not that expensive is</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about how it&rsquo;s worth a lot of money because</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth it&rsquo;s not that much i mean</p>
<p>one marijuana joint is like what is it like</p>
<p>10 or something like that probably</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t how much is a joint</p>
<p>a joint ten dollars</p>
<p>about ten dollars that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>california a joint will</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure</p>
<p>fuck you out of your mind</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>even if you</p>
<p>smoke a lot</p>
<p>if you actually inhaled</p>
<p>a full joint you would be blitzkrieg</p>
<p>california weed</p>
<p>california weed</p>
<p>so if you take</p>
<p>california weed and you mouth</p>
<p>mouth fuck it</p>
<p>right you could probably</p>
<p>get by on like</p>
<p>two hits of</p>
<p>california weed from a joint and you&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>things that you can do also is if you inhale it and you</p>
<p>breathe it out your nose so you put it in your</p>
<p>mouth and then</p>
<p>you blow it out your nose but you&rsquo;re not hailing it if</p>
<p>it even increases it</p>
<p>all right well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s post this up online just so everybody knows</p>
<p>what the fuck we&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>yeah but i used to i remember</p>
<p>there was somebody i used to know that would like</p>
<p>smoke she would only smoke with me but she</p>
<p>would sit i&rsquo;m not gonna inhale it but i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>smoke it with you if it makes you feel better i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay so she</p>
<p>would always get fucked up and i&rsquo;m like wow she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not stoned but why is she acting so fucked up</p>

<p>almost sold out</p>
<p>yeah it is very</p>
<p>close to sold out like all the shows what</p>
<p>about houston</p>
<p>a lot of houston people wondering</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re coming back to houston yeah i&rsquo;m coming back</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>now trying to figure out whether we&rsquo;re doing the improv</p>
<p>or whether we&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>house of blues there was a problem with the</p>
<p>house of blues initially</p>
<p>where they said the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>could not seat everybody</p>
<p>and i did not want to do a show</p>
<p>where people have to stand</p>
<p>and we talked</p>
<p>about this before that we went to the doug stanhope</p>
<p>show when he was in la</p>
<p>and i love doug</p>
<p>but i fucking can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand and just</p>
<p>watch a show for an hour and a half it hurts your feet</p>
<p>your back starts hurting your neck gets cramped up</p>
<p>and then i realize</p>
<p>like this is uncomfortable like sitting and</p>
<p>watching a show is awesome</p>
<p>but standing and</p>
<p>watching a show sucks it gets</p>
<p>annoying i&rsquo;m not a big fan of the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>i just went</p>
<p>through to see a concert</p>
<p>last week and i had a horrible</p>
<p>experience with</p>
<p>those fuckers with</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>which one though the one on sunset</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>when you go through they</p>
<p>stamp your hands they put</p>
<p>wristbands on they</p>
<p>check your ids they scan the tickets right</p>
<p>so we went there and it was general a mission</p>
<p>we found a place that we wanted to like sit and</p>
<p>lean up against the wall it was perfect for the concert</p>
<p>halfway through</p>
<p>the opening</p>
<p>act or whatever opening band</p>
<p>security grabbed my</p>
<p>girlfriend coming out of the bathroom and goes</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your hand stamp she goes</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe it washed off i have a wristband here&rsquo;s my ticket</p>
<p>he goes no your hand&rsquo;s not stamped you&rsquo;re out of here</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like what i have my ticket</p>
<p>right here he</p>
<p>goes i don&rsquo;t care you&rsquo;re supposed to have a handstand</p>
<p>she goes my boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>he goes go get him and he&rsquo;s kicked out too</p>
<p>like it was like</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>okay but that&rsquo;s just la douchebag no no</p>
<p>but then the manager got involved</p>
<p>right but that has nothing to do with houston</p>
<p>texas or no</p>
<p>even lose as a</p>
<p>company yeah it is</p>
<p>dickheads he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sorry corporate</p>
<p>policy you&rsquo;re supposed to get handstand i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter i&rsquo;m in here i have tickets and</p>
<p>what the fucking</p>
<p>manager goes i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but let&rsquo;s go downstairs let&rsquo;s get your hand stamp</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s figure this out together i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>the concerts on right now</p>
<p>god damn it was just like the biggest like fucking</p>
<p>corporate bullshit you know that shit</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t happen at fucking improv</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think so no you don&rsquo;t have your hand</p>
<p>stamp but you have a</p>
<p>ticket come on</p>
<p>so you think that</p>
<p>so what happened then you think</p>
<p>would not happen</p>
<p>so you think</p>
<p>that if we have a show at the</p>
<p>house of blues people</p>
<p>might get fucked my problem with the</p>
<p>house of blues it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>corporate thing</p>
<p>the whole not being able to make a</p>
<p>great fucking time at all the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>yeah well you have any time when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>front of a good</p>
<p>crowd of people</p>
<p>right yeah but that&rsquo;s one of the few</p>
<p>venues where you guarantee that</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna run smoothly</p>
<p>they get rid of douchebags in the audience</p>
<p>to record your own site</p>
<p>that is true</p>
<p>now that fans</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t allowed to</p>
<p>bring cameras into the</p>
<p>place or they have to</p>
<p>leave them at</p>
<p>the box office well the problem with that is</p>
<p>these motherfuckers want to</p>
<p>stick cameras in your face</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage and constantly record</p>
<p>things and put them on youtube they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that very</p>
<p>very distracting they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that regardless</p>
<p>but it is annoying for them and for the bands and for</p>
<p>different people</p>
<p>who feel like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their stuff pirated</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just protecting the artist that makes</p>
<p>sense to me</p>
<p>i agree but</p>
<p>he had a bad</p>
<p>experience but i</p>
<p>think he had isolated douchebags i mean people run</p>
<p>the house of blues in</p>
<p>in vegas are fucking awesome</p>
<p>those people are super cool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one we go to the most</p>
<p>yeah house of</p>
<p>blues and san</p>
<p>diego that we also know is</p>
<p>a performance side not a</p>
<p>customer that&rsquo;s true i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard any complaints so if you guys have had complaints</p>
<p>about the house of blues</p>
<p>let a nigga know</p>
<p>you know i need to</p>

<p>they have a lot of</p>
<p>built in costs</p>
<p>it costs i get</p>
<p>paid the same amount to do a 300 seat room in vegas</p>
<p>as i do to do the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>which is like 900 seats</p>
<p>which is pretty</p>
<p>crazy yeah it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>fucked up yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of fucked up because they have all</p>
<p>these built in</p>
<p>they have built in costs</p>
<p>built in pockets</p>
<p>oh shit built in pocket</p>
<p>yeah and their</p>
<p>prices that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing the prices</p>

<p>ingenious too convoluted</p>
<p>and too silly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wiki44 but that&rsquo;s wiki this is just</p>
<p>opinion there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>often a great deal of</p>
<p>uncertainty</p>
<p>and tracking word origins</p>
<p>since we have written</p>
<p>word record to go on</p>
<p>phrase may have been in common use long before anybody</p>
<p>wrote it down</p>
<p>after all one</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>slang phrases in most writing</p>
<p>such as newspaper a certain column is accepted</p>
<p>they should use</p>
<p>slang and everything</p>
<p>so talk why we pretended not talk the way we talk</p>
<p>i always thought that like</p>
<p>writing professionally like when i</p>
<p>write in my blogs i</p>
<p>write exactly the way i talk</p>
<p>just like i</p>
<p>wrote an open letter to kellogg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>which more or</p>
<p>less i did as a writing exercise i was writing</p>
<p>every day for a</p>
<p>month the month my</p>
<p>spike tv special was being recorded</p>
<p>so i wrote down</p>
<p>i wrote my material out</p>
<p>every day not</p>
<p>wrote to material i</p>
<p>wrote new blogs</p>
<p>every day and</p>
<p>you know i just needed shit to write</p>
<p>about and one of them was this</p>
<p>kellogg&rsquo;s banning michael phelps because he smoked weed</p>
<p>and because i</p>
<p>wrote this open letter and i</p>
<p>wrote it the way i talk with</p>
<p>swears and just the way i normally talk</p>
<p>people like yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna read that open letter like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t want to read it</p>
<p>stupid so i&rsquo;m just writing it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you read it or you don&rsquo;t read it but i&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>write something think</p>
<p>you have more impact just like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna listen</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna listen to a fucking</p>
<p>pothead comedian</p>
<p>slash cage fighting commentator like</p>
<p>kellogg&rsquo;s is</p>
<p>gonna make their</p>
<p>their decisions</p>
<p>based on that</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s for you guys it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>humor it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>does the word hip really hail</p>
<p>from a west african language</p>
<p>it could be either or though this</p>
<p>this i mean it could be</p>
<p>that that the the original hip that rivalries talked</p>
<p>about is right i mean this i mean if there&rsquo;s no real</p>
<p>if the origins of it are murky it could be both</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not saying anything to discredit that</p>
<p>anyway who gives a fuck</p>
<p>red ban is totally right about the cigars</p>
<p>oh is you really</p>
<p>totally right i am totally right no no it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>taste thing i think cigarettes are disgusting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sucking on them</p>
<p>every day you wouldn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re disgusting if you</p>
<p>smoke them for a week yeah you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>right about that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right if i was a junkie i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re disgusting</p>
<p>this guy had a shitty</p>
<p>experience at the anaheim</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>same deal as red band except</p>
<p>they had to make me re</p>
