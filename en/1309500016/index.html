    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>hey fancy seeing you here again</p>
<p>can you believe it</p>
<p>I always just want to be comfortable but this</p>
<p>chair doesn&rsquo;t allow for comfort</p>
<p>hi guys how are you</p>
<p>today I hope you are having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>if not sorry</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder Mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down I do my makeup and I talk</p>
<p>about a true crime case</p>
<p>that has been</p>
<p>on my brain</p>
<p>aka my noggin so</p>
<p>today I wanted to have a little chat</p>
<p>about the Richardson family</p>
<p>and this story is</p>
<p>based out of Medicine Hat Canada if you</p>
<p>watched last week&rsquo;s episode I</p>
<p>got really hung up on the city names Elephant Butte and</p>
<p>truth or Consequences</p>
<p>new Mexico and I was just like dude</p>
<p>these names</p>
<p>these names</p>
<p>okay and then a lot of you guys explained to me</p>
<p>where these names came from very interesting</p>
<p>thank you for that and then this week</p>
<p>Medicine Hat I was</p>
<p>stuck on it</p>
<p>these city names man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just getting to me so</p>
<p>Medicine Hat</p>
<p>Canada let me tell you</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s like a little suburb area a lot of middle</p>
<p>class family lives there</p>
<p>quiet so the Richardson</p>
<p>family was made up of Mark</p>
<p>was a father Debra was the mother</p>
<p>and then there were 2 children Jasmine</p>
<p>and Jacob Jasmine was 12 years old when the</p>
<p>story takes place and</p>
<p>Jacob was 8 years old Jasmine was attending</p>
<p>I think it was an all girls Catholic</p>
<p>school she was</p>
<p>known to be a good kid</p>
<p>what can you say</p>
<p>about 12 year olds you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always good</p>
<p>until they hit</p>
<p>their teenage years am I</p>
<p>right but Jasmine was</p>
<p>nice she was a good kid</p>
<p>did well in school</p>
<p>and Jacob the</p>
<p>8 year old like family friends</p>
<p>would say that he was a</p>
<p>class clown he was goofy</p>
<p>just like a typical</p>
<p>typical 8 year old you</p>
<p>know the Richardson</p>
<p>family they were pretty tight knit</p>
<p>and they were just a very</p>
<p>close loving family</p>
<p>so Jasmine was 12</p>
<p>right and she was approaching her</p>
<p>teenage years</p>
<p>and her parents noticed that</p>
<p>she started to change</p>
<p>most do when they hit</p>
<p>their teenage years or pre teen years</p>
<p>so when they</p>
<p>started to notice just a change in jasmine&rsquo;s attitude</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think much of it</p>
<p>with Jasmine</p>
<p>okay so she had some friends at her Catholic school</p>
<p>right and she was like a rule follower and she just</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call her a goody 2</p>
<p>shoes because like I feel like that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right word she she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>followed the rules and was a good kid</p>
<p>right she liked to wear pink</p>
<p>pink her hair</p>
<p>color and girly</p>
<p>things when she was 12</p>
<p>her parents</p>
<p>started to notice a change in her attitude</p>
<p>so then they also noticed a change</p>
<p>in her appearance and it kind of</p>
<p>started a little slow</p>
<p>right so at</p>
<p>first it was just like Jasmine</p>
<p>really liked wearing</p>
<p>color and pink</p>
<p>and now all of a sudden</p>
<p>she seemed to be more interested in darker makeup the</p>
<p>first red flag</p>
<p>then she started to just mainly</p>
<p>wanna wear darker</p>
<p>clothes all</p>
<p>black and then Jasmine</p>
<p>was more interested</p>
<p>in punk rock the</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s music</p>
<p>so Jasmine and her friends at</p>
<p>school they</p>
<p>started like go</p>
<p>their own ways a little bit they noticed that Jasmine</p>
<p>her interests were changing</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>becoming a little bit of a rebel</p>
<p>Jasmine was showing up to</p>
<p>school in all</p>
<p>black clothing fishnets</p>
<p>choker we got</p>
<p>chains the dark Gothic</p>
<p>makeup and jewelry that wasn&rsquo;t allowed at the</p>
<p>school so she</p>
<p>started to draw like fake</p>
<p>tattoos on her hands and</p>
<p>stuff with like a</p>
<p>sharpie marker but it was like</p>
<p>devil stuff</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s out of the Catholic</p>
<p>school so she</p>
<p>would get pulled into the office she</p>
<p>would get in</p>
<p>trouble and</p>
<p>school officials kind of</p>
<p>found themselves really on jasmine&rsquo;s behind because</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t obeying</p>
<p>dress code she was writing</p>
<p>stuff all over</p>
<p>her body that was like satanic</p>
<p>and Jasmine just</p>
<p>started to get in</p>
<p>trouble more and more</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t even because of her</p>
<p>school work she was</p>
<p>still doing well in</p>
<p>school it was just that she wasn&rsquo;t following the</p>
<p>dress code and</p>
<p>she started to have a little sass</p>
<p>the school teachers at the Catholic</p>
<p>school they</p>
<p>thought you know it was odd because they knew Jasmine</p>
<p>as the goody girl</p>
<p>and now she was challenging</p>
<p>teachers giving pushback</p>
<p>snarky remarks</p>
<p>she was just being</p>
<p>sassy so one evening</p>
<p>Jasmine attended</p>
<p>a punk rock show</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>which one I</p>
<p>try to find it I&rsquo;m a curious cat I&rsquo;ve said this before</p>
<p>meow I just want to know</p>
<p>and find it I don&rsquo;t know if she went</p>
<p>with friends or anything but the only information I</p>
<p>could find was that she attended a punk rock show</p>
<p>so while she was there she met this guy</p>
<p>and she sees him at the show</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like oh my God</p>
<p>he is so fine</p>
<p>and his name is Jeremy</p>
<p>so Jeremy like showed some interest</p>
<p>in Jasmine he was talking to</p>
<p>her he was making her feel cute making her feel special</p>
<p>and guess how old Jeremy was</p>
<p>23 he was 23 at this time talking to a</p>
<p>12 year old</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about you but I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a problem Jeremy a little bit</p>
<p>about him he was unemployed he was a high</p>
<p>school dropout</p>
<p>he lived in a not so</p>
<p>great neighborhood</p>
<p>what Jasmine</p>
<p>really found like repealing</p>
<p>about him was well</p>
<p>first of all this</p>
<p>older man is just like showing interest in her</p>
<p>you know but also he was just full</p>
<p>blown goth kid he wore</p>
<p>you know all</p>
<p>black he had eyeliner it was all</p>
<p>smudged and just like</p>
<p>and she just thought oh bad boy</p>
<p>which side note I feel like this needs to be talked</p>
<p>about just in general</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if any</p>
<p>of you guys can relate to this but when I was in high</p>
<p>school I remember</p>
<p>high school student</p>
<p>like my fellow</p>
<p>classmates they</p>
<p>would be talking</p>
<p>about how they were dating like an 18</p>
<p>year old I remember one girl was dating a 20 year old</p>
<p>and at the time a lot of us</p>
<p>were like oh my God she&rsquo;s so cool she&rsquo;s dating like an</p>
<p>older man wow</p>
<p>oh my gosh and now looking back I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>huh if you are in high</p>
<p>school you do not need to be dating</p>
<p>older men and if</p>
<p>older men are dating</p>
<p>young high schoolers like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gross and I</p>
<p>never really thought</p>
<p>about that until recently and I was like wait a</p>
<p>minute it&rsquo;s not cool to date</p>
<p>an older guy</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m dating an</p>
<p>older guy but</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re a kid it&rsquo;s not cool so just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s my one</p>
<p>piece of advice just don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>anyways I&rsquo;m getting off</p>
<p>track okay so at this show</p>
<p>Jasmine gives</p>
<p>Jeremy her new friend her</p>
<p>phone number</p>
<p>and the 2 start hanging out</p>
<p>secretly Jasmine</p>
<p>would tell her parents that she was</p>
<p>going to her friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house or something to</p>
<p>study she was</p>
<p>going out she was</p>
<p>sneaking out to go see this Jeremy guy</p>
<p>but when they couldn&rsquo;t hang out they</p>
<p>would stay in</p>
<p>touch by messaging each</p>
<p>other like on chat website they also had MySpace</p>
<p>other social</p>
<p>media sites</p>
<p>this was 2006</p>
<p>my apologies</p>
<p>back to Jeremy</p>
<p>the guy she met he</p>
<p>would wear a vial of</p>
<p>blood around his neck like it was a necklace</p>
<p>right and had a little vial</p>
<p>and he said that there was</p>
<p>blood in there and</p>
<p>he would brag all the time to Jasmine</p>
<p>that he loved</p>
<p>taste of blood</p>
<p>and he needed it to survive and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like why is that why do you need to survive oh my God</p>
<p>are you a vampire</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>vampire but</p>
<p>guess what he is</p>
<p>so Jeremy tells Jasmine</p>
<p>this part made me</p>
<p>laugh cry and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry for laugh crying</p>
<p>but it was hilarious to me so Jeremy</p>
<p>tells Jasmine</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a 300 year old werewolf</p>
<p>and when Jasmine</p>
<p>heard this she was like wow</p>
<p>300 year old werewolf who drinks</p>
<p>blood sign me up</p>
<p>I feel bad for this Jeremy guy because he&rsquo;s 23</p>
<p>and he just kind of seems very lost</p>
<p>in the world but again</p>
<p>Jasmine is 12 years old when you are a</p>
<p>teenager or</p>
<p>have that adolescent</p>
<p>brain that is the dumbest</p>
<p>brain you will ever have in your whole life</p>
<p>who have no common</p>
<p>sense Jasmine</p>
<p>and Jeremy they were sexually active as well so</p>
<p>she kind of</p>
<p>started to just act different too</p>
<p>a couple months</p>
<p>after meeting Jeremy that&rsquo;s when Jasmine becomes</p>
<p>full blown Gothic</p>
<p>she was in it deep now she was committed</p>
<p>a lot of jasmine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>older friends</p>
<p>would say that they became</p>
<p>afraid of her they were scared of her</p>
<p>dressing scary she</p>
<p>would draw like little</p>
<p>crosses and</p>
<p>stuff on her forehead</p>
<p>they said that she was just quote</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s what they said I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>weird Jasmine</p>
<p>said that she liked</p>
<p>the idea of scaring people because it made her feel</p>
<p>powerful and like in charge</p>
<p>and Jeremy just became the center of her world</p>
<p>she was infatuated</p>
<p>so Jasmine she would</p>
<p>spend a lot of her time</p>
<p>on like MySpace</p>
<p>was on this website called</p>
<p>vampire freaks com</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty similar</p>
<p>to MySpace social</p>
<p>media platform</p>
<p>where you have friends you can talk to people you can</p>
<p>leave comments</p>
<p>pictures all that jazz but I</p>
<p>guess mainly</p>
<p>targeted towards the</p>
<p>vampires of the</p>
<p>world I think</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>on jasmine&rsquo;s MySpace profile</p>
<p>her heroes used to be her mom and her dad and like God</p>
<p>and now she had</p>
<p>changed her hero section</p>
<p>to Marilyn Manson</p>
<p>and Jeffrey Dahmer</p>
<p>another red flag for the parents like ooh</p>
<p>on vampirefreaks com</p>
<p>on her like</p>
<p>about me or</p>
<p>where you describe yourself</p>
<p>she described herself as bisexual a Wiccan</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this big fat long list of</p>
<p>stuff but like let&rsquo;s pick and choose</p>
<p>Wiccan awkward</p>
<p>loud a deep</p>
<p>thinker and insane</p>
<p>she listed her interests</p>
<p>as unnatural hair colors</p>
<p>dark poetry</p>
<p>blood and kinky shit</p>
<p>Jeremy was so like heavily</p>
<p>on that website that was like his main go to website</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>they would communicate most of the time</p>
<p>so jeremy&rsquo;s profile his</p>
<p>about me section also very long he said that he liked</p>
<p>skateboarding</p>
<p>mosh pits loud</p>
<p>music tattoos kinky fetishes</p>
<p>criss angel</p>
<p>who likes Criss</p>
<p>Angel that would be my red flag</p>
<p>not the point Bailey</p>
<p>so Jasmine kept the relationship hidden</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t let your family know that you&rsquo;re dating a</p>
<p>23 year old werewolf</p>
<p>and then finally jasmine&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>they let go look at her social</p>
<p>media and they see like that she loves somebody</p>
<p>and they kind</p>
<p>of connect the dots they find out that she</p>
<p>sneaking out or just like not coming home</p>
<p>that just pissed them off her parents just they</p>
<p>finally had to do something she was being disrespectful</p>
<p>she was acting more rebellious</p>
<p>Jasmine wasn&rsquo;t respecting</p>
<p>their household</p>
<p>their rules</p>
<p>they told Jasmine</p>
<p>you have to stop</p>
<p>seeing this guy like you can&rsquo;t be seeing him he&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>older than you they told her that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s no longer allowed to see Jeremy</p>
<p>not allowed to</p>
<p>leave the house</p>
<p>unless she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to school</p>
<p>no ifs ands or</p>
<p>buts and of course this just</p>
<p>caused Jasmine to lose</p>
<p>lose it completely</p>
<p>and she just acted out even more she rebelled even more</p>
<p>and basically that</p>
<p>started a war in the</p>
<p>house so Jeremy</p>
<p>and Jasmine they would</p>
<p>still communicate online</p>
<p>and that was now the main way that they talked</p>
<p>and Jasmine</p>
<p>would be the one who proposed</p>
<p>that Jeremy</p>
<p>maybe gets rid of the problem</p>
<p>she wrote to Jeremy which</p>
<p>later they were able to</p>
<p>pull these records but she</p>
<p>wrote to Jeremy</p>
<p>quote I have</p>
<p>this plan it</p>
<p>begins with me killing them</p>
<p>and ends with me</p>
<p>living with you</p>
<p>very suspicious</p>
<p>and then Jeremy</p>
<p>would go on to</p>
<p>write their</p>
<p>throats I want to slit</p>
<p>they will regret the shit they have done</p>
<p>finally there</p>
<p>shall be silence</p>
<p>their blood</p>
<p>shall be my payment</p>
<p>and Jeremy wrote this</p>
<p>in response</p>
<p>and she would constantly</p>
<p>express to Jeremy how much she hated her family she</p>
<p>just wanted them gone because they were the reason why</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t be together</p>
<p>so then on the evening of</p>
<p>April 23rd 2006</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s night time okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quiet suburban</p>
<p>street everybody&rsquo;s in bed or at</p>
<p>least getting</p>
<p>ready for bed</p>
<p>but Debra the mom</p>
<p>she heard some</p>
<p>noises downstairs</p>
<p>puts on her robe and she goes downstairs to investigate</p>
<p>goes to turn on the</p>
<p>light she was met</p>
<p>with a man wearing a mask</p>
<p>holding a knife so</p>
<p>naturally she</p>
<p>starts screaming</p>
<p>she ends up getting attacked by this intruder and Debra</p>
<p>poor Debra she was</p>
<p>stabbed 12 times</p>
<p>over and over and over</p>
<p>again and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>screaming the whole time</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s screaming</p>
<p>she woke up everybody in the</p>
<p>house her husband Mark or</p>
<p>jasmine&rsquo;s dad comes downstairs to</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s going on that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he sees this man over his wife just</p>
<p>going at it like</p>
<p>stabbing her and just blood</p>
<p>everywhere oh my gosh I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine</p>
<p>like seeing</p>
<p>especially the one you love your partner</p>
<p>being attacked</p>
<p>so Mark reacts and he grabs tool that was</p>
<p>close by I think it was a</p>
<p>screwdriver or something he like grabs it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to like</p>
<p>fight this guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on top</p>
<p>of his wife and he&rsquo;s trying anything he can</p>
<p>punching him he&rsquo;s trying to stab him and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sadly though he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t win the</p>
<p>fight he ended up being</p>
<p>stabbed a total of 24 times</p>
<p>which resulted in mark&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death Jasmine was</p>
<p>like upstairs in her room or something pretending to</p>
<p>sleep so upstairs</p>
<p>next to jasmine&rsquo;s room is her younger brother&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>so the little boy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>8 and he woke up because of all the ruckus</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s scared so he&rsquo;s like hiding in his room on his bed</p>
<p>and so then Jasmine comes running into the room</p>
<p>so then she&rsquo;s putting her hands over her brother&rsquo;s ears</p>
<p>and just like protecting him from the loud</p>
<p>screaming that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>stupid because</p>
<p>then jasmine&rsquo;s boyfriend comes upstairs after just</p>
<p>he just killed the both parents</p>
<p>right he comes upstairs instead of Jasmine</p>
<p>just saying like hey</p>
<p>maybe you know</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t kill my brother let&rsquo;s not do it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little kid he&rsquo;s only 8 no</p>
<p>Jasmine instead is the one who</p>
<p>decided Jacob her</p>
<p>8 year old brother</p>
<p>he had to go</p>
<p>which is completely heartless</p>
<p>so her reasoning</p>
<p>for having to get rid of her younger brother</p>
<p>was because both of his parents were dead now</p>
<p>so what was the</p>
<p>point he wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>ready to start her new life with Jeremy</p>
<p>so this poor</p>
<p>8 year old little boy Jasmine</p>
<p>is the one who ends up</p>
<p>stabbing her brother 5 times</p>
<p>and then on</p>
<p>top of that just to make sure that he is indeed dead</p>
<p>she slits his throat</p>
<p>like what the hell</p>
<p>how do you do that I was reading this</p>
<p>and I was just like dude I hate them I hate them okay</p>
<p>so that same evening when the murders took place oh</p>
<p>a 6 year old little boy he was a neighbor</p>
<p>he came over to the Richardsons</p>
<p>house because he wanted to ask</p>
<p>Jacob if he wanted to come outside and play with him</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s knocking on the door</p>
<p>hello he&rsquo;s waiting</p>
<p>so he kind of like peeks through the window</p>
<p>by the front</p>
<p>door when this little boy peeks through the window</p>
<p>he sees oh some shit</p>
<p>so those poor little boy traumatized</p>
<p>forever he sees just</p>
<p>blood everywhere and then</p>
<p>body on the</p>
<p>floor so he went</p>
<p>running home just</p>
<p>screaming and he tells his parents I</p>
<p>think they go over to the</p>
<p>house to look and then</p>
<p>the police are</p>
<p>called so the police come over to the home</p>
<p>when they walk into the</p>
<p>house the police</p>
<p>see just a nightmare</p>
<p>I guess that there was just blood</p>
<p>everywhere okay just</p>
<p>everywhere what a hard job huh you kind of forget</p>
<p>they gotta see some really fucked up shit Bailey stop</p>
<p>cussing the investigators in the</p>
<p>house searching</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>they had no idea what happened</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking what is this like domestic abuse</p>
<p>a burglary gone</p>
<p>wrong so when they go into</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s room and they see like his</p>
<p>his throat is</p>
<p>cut investigators are like okay this is somebody</p>
<p>who had to know the family like this is personal</p>
<p>so one of the officers inside of the home he notices</p>
<p>a family portrait</p>
<p>that was like hanging on the wall and he sees okay</p>
<p>we have the mom the dad the brother and then the</p>
<p>daughter hmm</p>
<p>police think that the 12 year old</p>
<p>daughter had been</p>
<p>kidnapped by the killer</p>
<p>so they put out an amber</p>
<p>alert hoping that somebody</p>
<p>somebody will find the missing</p>
<p>daughter just hours</p>
<p>after the murders</p>
<p>police go down to the</p>
<p>school of Jasmine</p>
<p>to search her</p>
<p>school locker</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hoping to find any types of clues</p>
<p>looking for signs</p>
<p>anything so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through jasmine&rsquo;s locker</p>
<p>right away they find a drawing that gives everybody the</p>
<p>creeps but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>stick drawings very creative</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a drawing of a house with</p>
<p>stick figures inside the home</p>
<p>and then the home&rsquo;s on fire</p>
<p>and it looks like the</p>
<p>stick figures were on fire as well</p>
<p>then there are like 2</p>
<p>stick figures running away from the home that&rsquo;s on fire</p>
<p>next to a car and</p>
<p>above it says</p>
<p>mwahahahaha</p>
<p>like they had gotten away from the fire</p>
<p>or maybe set the fire</p>
<p>just looking at all sorts of</p>
<p>stick figure evil</p>
<p>so once they found</p>
<p>that drawing</p>
<p>investigators looked at the missing girl Jasmine</p>
<p>from a missing person to now</p>
<p>a murder suspect I mean this</p>
<p>drawing was</p>
<p>super suspicious</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like why is this girl drawing this evil</p>
<p>thing what looks to be 2</p>
<p>stick figures that represent her and somebody else</p>
<p>set in this</p>
<p>house on fire</p>
<p>which resembles or looks like or</p>
<p>could be her</p>
<p>her family home you know</p>
<p>they got to put the</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>police investigators go looking for Jasmine</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t even take</p>
<p>them that long to find her now I couldn&rsquo;t exactly find</p>
<p>how they found her</p>
<p>like how they</p>
<p>did somebody tip them off or what happened</p>
<p>but they ended up finding both Jasmine</p>
<p>and Jeremy within</p>
<p>the like first 24 hours</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>about 100 miles</p>
<p>away in the town called Leader</p>
<p>and they were placed</p>
<p>under arrest</p>
<p>now when they were being arrested police</p>
<p>they said like they didn&rsquo;t display any grief</p>
<p>or sadness they didn&rsquo;t seem concerned at all</p>
<p>and Jeremy he bragged</p>
<p>about his eye</p>
<p>cause he had like a</p>
<p>black eye Jeremy said that Mark jasmine&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>the father had</p>
<p>punched him in the face</p>
<p>and he was kind of like laughing</p>
<p>about it so</p>
<p>first with Jasmine</p>
<p>and her trial</p>
<p>her trial began</p>
<p>in June of the following year</p>
<p>so at her trial</p>
<p>Jasmine was</p>
<p>asked why she murdered her parents</p>
<p>and her little brother and Jasmine said</p>
<p>quote I loved Jeremy so much</p>
<p>thought it was</p>
<p>going to bring us closer together end</p>
<p>quote so then evidence was brought in</p>
<p>and this evidence was a</p>
<p>stack of jailhouse letters</p>
<p>exchanged between</p>
<p>Jasmine and Jeremy</p>
<p>after their arrest so</p>
<p>when they were in prison they were writing one another</p>
<p>there were tons of letters</p>
<p>and in one of</p>
<p>those letters Jasmine joked that they were legends</p>
<p>and immortal</p>
<p>neither Jasmine</p>
<p>or Jeremy mentioned</p>
<p>any guilt or</p>
<p>remorse for what they did</p>
<p>it was more of them just</p>
<p>planning their future together</p>
<p>as if they were</p>
<p>gonna get out of prison</p>
<p>tomorrow I keep having to remind myself over and over</p>
<p>again like that she&rsquo;s only 12 at this time</p>
<p>so she just has</p>
<p>no idea like she killed her family and she&rsquo;s in prison</p>
<p>and in another letter</p>
<p>from Jasmine</p>
<p>they brought forward as evidence</p>
<p>it said quote</p>
<p>never has a person affected me so much</p>
<p>always will there be something missing without you</p>
<p>with me my lawyer tells me we&rsquo;re legends</p>
<p>ah closer to immortality</p>
<p>it would seem so then they</p>
<p>bring in another letter</p>
<p>from Jeremy</p>
<p>and it says</p>
<p>quote I love you more than life itself I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>added you to my visitors list so once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re released please</p>
<p>visit often</p>
<p>never forget how much I care</p>
<p>or that I love you</p>
<p>without you this life isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worth living you said you want to get</p>
<p>engaged question Mark then here&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>will you marry me if so then it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>verbal agreement</p>
<p>so pretty much she was asking her to</p>
<p>marry sounds</p>
<p>great okay and then in her response letter</p>
<p>she said yes</p>
<p>this is quotes</p>
<p>yes yes I will I</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>and then she said the</p>
<p>world really is against us</p>
<p>roar end quote roar roar</p>
<p>side note because I remember the MySpace kids</p>
<p>using that word roar roar I never</p>
<p>understood it it was always the scene kids roar</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna Google it hold on roar</p>
<p>that means I love you in Dinosaur</p>
<p>anyways I saw all the</p>
<p>scene kids always</p>
<p>using that word I</p>
<p>never got it no can&rsquo;t relate</p>
<p>anyways she</p>
<p>yeah she said that to him in a letter so whatever</p>
<p>so again in</p>
<p>these letters they</p>
<p>never mention any</p>
<p>guilt or remorse</p>
<p>over the crimes instead</p>
<p>focusing on</p>
<p>their relationship and how being in prison</p>
<p>seemed to be a temporary setback</p>
<p>Jasmine took the</p>
<p>stand in her own defense on</p>
<p>July 3rd 2007</p>
<p>During her testimony</p>
<p>she told the</p>
<p>court that she had a</p>
<p>hypothetical conversation</p>
<p>about killing her family</p>
<p>and possibly making the</p>
<p>deaths look like a murder suicide</p>
<p>or an accident but</p>
<p>never intended on actually</p>
<p>going through with it and then</p>
<p>when questioned</p>
<p>about the letters to</p>
<p>Jeremy she said she was referring</p>
<p>to her 5 minutes of fame</p>
<p>that people are</p>
<p>gonna remember them forever</p>
<p>I mean they seem to like the idea</p>
<p>of that Jasmine said she was home</p>
<p>when the murders took</p>
<p>place that she was</p>
<p>upstairs in her brother&rsquo;s room trying to</p>
<p>cover his ears so he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>their parents</p>
<p>screaming she then said that Jeremy</p>
<p>came upstairs into the brother&rsquo;s room and yelled at her</p>
<p>kill her brother and that she had</p>
<p>to do it because he just killed her</p>
<p>parents for them so she needed to participate Jasmine</p>
<p>would go on to say that she</p>
<p>stabbed him but</p>
<p>not very hard</p>
<p>she pled not guilty</p>
<p>to all 3 counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>but after just</p>
<p>3 hours of deliberation</p>
<p>on July 10th</p>
<p>2007 the jury</p>
<p>found her guilty</p>
<p>on all 3 counts</p>
<p>she was sentenced</p>
<p>get this Canada</p>
<p>is for the people</p>
<p>she was sentenced to only 10</p>
<p>years of imprisonment the maximum</p>
<p>sentence allowed by the Youth Criminal Justice Act</p>
<p>which states</p>
<p>that convicts who are</p>
<p>under the age of 14</p>
<p>at the time they committed the act cannot be</p>
<p>charged as an</p>
<p>adult and can only be</p>
<p>given a maximum sentence of 10 years</p>
<p>when I first</p>
<p>heard this I was like what it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so she got a credit for 18</p>
<p>months for the time that she had already served</p>
<p>while waiting for</p>
<p>her trial and then 4 of</p>
<p>those years out of the 10 years</p>
<p>those were going to be spent in a</p>
<p>psychiatric facility</p>
<p>she would do 4 and 1/2 years</p>
<p>under conditional</p>
<p>supervision</p>
<p>in the community</p>
<p>so a lot of people were outraged I</p>
<p>should put on lipstick</p>
<p>cause I probably look</p>
<p>crazy huh a lot of people</p>
<p>are outraged</p>
<p>the Canadian law is set up to rehabilitate</p>
<p>people to help them and to not necessarily punish them</p>
<p>I mean obviously</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know this I don&rsquo;t live there</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of arguments</p>
<p>about this and how it all works but</p>
<p>based from like me and</p>
<p>somebody on the outside looking in kind of</p>
<p>sounds nice</p>
<p>before you start yelling at me put</p>
<p>those fingers down when you think</p>
<p>about how we work here in the US they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about actually helping and</p>
<p>fixing people or</p>
<p>treating people</p>
<p>for a mental illness</p>
<p>or setting them up for</p>
<p>like success</p>
<p>beyond prison</p>
<p>pretty much out</p>
<p>here in the US it&rsquo;s like they just lock you up and they</p>
<p>throw away the key they</p>
<p>treat you like shit I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I just thought like oh at</p>
<p>least they&rsquo;re trying to kind of like give her</p>
<p>a chance but</p>
<p>it should be case by case you know like with her case</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know man moving on</p>
<p>so Jeremy the boyfriend who killed the mom and dad his</p>
<p>trial was in December of 2008 he</p>
<p>was just straight up</p>
<p>found guilty of</p>
<p>3 counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>and sentenced</p>
<p>to 3 concurrent life sentences in prison</p>
<p>he will be up for parole</p>
<p>after serving 25 years</p>
<p>I was about to say</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s kind of not fair that she only got 10 years</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m kind of torn on this one</p>
<p>like they both did a very very</p>
<p>awful thing</p>
<p>anyways so in</p>
<p>2012 Jeremy</p>
<p>he changed his name to Jackson May</p>
<p>and he tried to appeal</p>
<p>his case but he failed</p>
<p>which is so strange to me like I didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>you could change your name in prison</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just learning all sorts of new things</p>
<p>so guess what though</p>
<p>so in 2015 Jasmine</p>
<p>she completed her sentence and was</p>
<p>fully released at the</p>
<p>age of 23 she&rsquo;s been keeping a very low profile</p>
<p>since her release</p>
<p>if she can go 5 years without any</p>
<p>legal altercations</p>
<p>her juvenile</p>
<p>record will be expunged</p>
<p>aka erased like it</p>
<p>never existed so Jasmine</p>
<p>she got the Crown</p>
<p>of canada&rsquo;s youngest convicted murderer at age 12</p>
<p>congratulations Jasmine</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s inappropriate but</p>
<p>like what she&rsquo;s 12</p>
<p>what the fuck so it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>uncertain though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no like</p>
<p>clear reports</p>
<p>indicating that Jasmine and Jeremy</p>
<p>are still a couple that they got</p>
<p>married nobody really knows I</p>
<p>doubt it but who knows</p>
<p>so then there&rsquo;s another side people</p>
<p>standing up for Jeremy</p>
<p>there are a lot of people behind Jeremy</p>
<p>saying he shouldn&rsquo;t have received such a</p>
<p>harsh sentence compared to Jasmine</p>
<p>he came from a very abusive upbringing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also said that Jeremy</p>
<p>has severe FAS</p>
<p>what would be considered distinct</p>
<p>facial characteristics</p>
<p>popular amongst</p>
<p>Fetal alcohol</p>
<p>syndrome sufferers</p>
<p>part of this condition</p>
<p>is severely</p>
<p>impaired judgment</p>
<p>meaning that</p>
<p>Jeremy didn&rsquo;t have the full mental capacity to fully</p>
<p>understand what he was doing</p>
<p>doing and just followed</p>
<p>along with what Jasmine told him</p>
<p>or suggested he did</p>
<p>and that Jasmine</p>
<p>is the one who manipulated him into killing her family</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna say like</p>
<p>he should be released</p>
<p>cause at the end</p>
<p>of the day he he didn&rsquo;t like to stab him one or 2 times</p>
<p>he went for it</p>
<p>kind of scary</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this is your</p>
<p>fight Canada not mine we have pretty bad people here</p>
<p>whatever and that is the story</p>
<p>about the Richardson family rest in</p>
<p>peace to Mark Debra and</p>
<p>Jacob you know</p>
<p>their lives were</p>
<p>taken for no goddamn reason</p>
<p>and on that note they</p>
<p>should remain in prison because that would</p>
<p>I just feel bad that</p>
<p>Jeremy still in prison</p>
<p>while Jasmine just was like okay thanks bye</p>
<p>and then got to go on to college I</p>
<p>guess she got a scholarship when she was in prison</p>
<p>she got a scholarship</p>
<p>to go to college let me know your thoughts</p>
<p>about this case down</p>
<p>below do you</p>
<p>think Jasmine</p>
<p>should be out</p>
<p>I mean I was trying to find like</p>
<p>and update a</p>
<p>Where is she now</p>
<p>I found like a YouTube</p>
<p>video and some people</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s her</p>
<p>as an adult</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really tell</p>
<p>plus I&rsquo;m sure she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>wanna be associated</p>
<p>with what she did I will say this though</p>
<p>when I was reading</p>
<p>about this case and</p>
<p>trying to get all the info</p>
<p>all that good</p>
<p>stuff the one</p>
<p>thing I could not find</p>
<p>and I looked</p>
<p>high I looked low I</p>
<p>still could have missed it</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m not perfect and the one</p>
<p>thing I could not find was an apology</p>
<p>not once did I</p>
<p>see or read something</p>
<p>where like Jasmine</p>
<p>maybe cried and said I&rsquo;m so sorry I</p>
<p>understand what I did and</p>
<p>maybe she did in private she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to do it publicly but</p>
<p>you have such a public murder</p>
<p>trial and stuff you think you</p>
<p>would do it just to get forgiveness from your community</p>
<p>right again</p>
<p>she could have apologized and I just missed it</p>
<p>maybe she changed her name to an</p>
<p>Houston and announced it like Jeremy I</p>
<p>think if there&rsquo;s anything to take away from this case</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because jasmine&rsquo;s family they seem like to do</p>
<p>everything kind of</p>
<p>right I don&rsquo;t know what they</p>
<p>could have done differently besides like lock her up</p>
<p>and this is why I don&rsquo;t want kids because they are the</p>
<p>devil they&rsquo;re already hard to</p>
<p>raise now you</p>
<p>gotta be all</p>
<p>worried that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna murder you like come</p>
<p>on when do you get a break</p>
<p>oh I know parents</p>
<p>make sure to be</p>
<p>checking on what your kids are doing</p>
<p>check their phones</p>
<p>check in with them on social</p>
<p>media make sure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not talking to any werewolves and</p>
<p>stuff like that okay</p>
<p>okay tell them I sent you</p>
<p>if they are asking you why</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today I hope you have a wonderful day make good choices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
