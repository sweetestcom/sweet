    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about free speech and censorship.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t build a company like this</p>
<p>unless you believe that people expressing themselves</p>
<p>is a good thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you as a father,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weight heavy on you</p>
<p>that people get bullied on social networks.</p>
<p>I care a lot about how people feel</p>
<p>when they use our products</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to build products that make people angry.</p>
<p>Why do you think so many people dislike you?</p>
<p>Some even hate you.</p>
<p>And how do you regain their trust and support?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>CEO of Facebook, now called Meta.</p>
<p>Please allow me to say a few words</p>
<p>about this conversation with Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>about social media,</p>
<p>and about what troubles me in the world today,</p>
<p>and what gives me hope.</p>
<p>If this is not interesting to you,</p>
<p>I understand, please skip.</p>
<p>I believe that at its best,</p>
<p>social media puts a mirror to humanity</p>
<p>and reveals the full complexity of our world,</p>
<p>shining a light on the dark aspects of human nature</p>
<p>and giving us hope, a way out,</p>
<p>through compassionate but tense chaos of conversation</p>
<p>that eventually can turn into understanding,</p>
<p>friendship, and even love.</p>
<p>But this is not simple.</p>
<p>Our world is not simple.</p>
<p>It is full of human suffering.</p>
<p>I think about the hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p>who are starving and who live in extreme poverty,</p>
<p>the one million people who take their own life every year,</p>
<p>the 20 million people that attempt it,</p>
<p>and the many, many more millions who suffer quietly</p>
<p>in ways that numbers can never know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m troubled by the cruelty and pain of war.</p>
<p>Today, my heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.</p>
<p>My grandfather spilled his blood on this land,</p>
<p>held the line as a machine gunner</p>
<p>against the Nazi invasion, surviving impossible odds.</p>
<p>I am nothing without him.</p>
<p>His blood runs in my blood.</p>
<p>My words are useless here.</p>
<p>I send my love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all I have.</p>
<p>I hope to travel to Russia and Ukraine soon.</p>
<p>I will speak to citizens and leaders,</p>
<p>including Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said in the past, I don&rsquo;t care about access,</p>
<p>fame, money, or power, and I&rsquo;m afraid of nothing.</p>
<p>But I am who I am, and my goal in conversation</p>
<p>is to understand the human being before me,</p>
<p>no matter who they are, no matter their position.</p>
<p>And I do believe the line between good and evil</p>
<p>runs through the heart of every man.</p>
<p>So this is it.</p>
<p>This is our world.</p>
<p>It is full of hate, violence, and destruction.</p>
<p>But it is also full of love, beauty,</p>
<p>and the insatiable desire to help each other.</p>
<p>The people who run the social networks</p>
<p>that show this world, that show us to ourselves,</p>
<p>have the greatest of responsibilities.</p>
<p>In a time of war, pandemic, atrocity,</p>
<p>we turn to social networks to share real human insights</p>
<p>and experiences, to organize protests and celebrations,</p>
<p>to learn and to challenge our understanding of the world,</p>
<p>of our history and of our future,</p>
<p>and above all, to be reminded of our common humanity.</p>
<p>When the social networks fail,</p>
<p>they have the power to cause immense suffering.</p>
<p>And when they succeed,</p>
<p>they have the power to lessen that suffering.</p>
<p>This is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a responsibility, perhaps,</p>
<p>almost unlike any other in history.</p>
<p>This podcast conversation attempts to understand the man</p>
<p>and the company who take this responsibility on,</p>
<p>where they fail and where they hope to succeed.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s feet are often held to the fire,</p>
<p>as they should be, and this actually gives me hope.</p>
<p>The power of innovation and engineering,</p>
<p>coupled with the freedom of speech</p>
<p>in the form of its highest ideal,</p>
<p>I believe can solve any problem in the world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just it, both are necessary,</p>
<p>the engineer and the critic.</p>
<p>I believe that criticism is essential, but cynicism is not.</p>
<p>And I worry that in our public discourse,</p>
<p>cynicism too easily masquerades as wisdom, as truth,</p>
<p>becomes viral and takes over,</p>
<p>and worse, suffocates the dreams of young minds</p>
<p>who want to build solutions to the problems of the world.</p>
<p>We need to inspire those young minds.</p>
<p>At least for me, they give me hope.</p>
<p>And one small way I&rsquo;m trying to contribute</p>
<p>is to have honest conversations like these</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t just ride the viral wave of cynicism,</p>
<p>but seek to understand the failures</p>
<p>and successes of the past, the problems before us,</p>
<p>and the possible solutions</p>
<p>in this very complicated world of ours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I will fail often,</p>
<p>and I count on the critic to point it out when I do.</p>
<p>But I ask for one thing,</p>
<p>and that is to fuel the fire of optimism,</p>
<p>especially in those who dream to build solutions,</p>
<p>because without that, we don&rsquo;t have a chance</p>
<p>on this too fragile, tiny planet of ours.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Can you circle all the traffic lights, please?</p>
<p>You actually did it.</p>
<p>That is very impressive performance.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can initiate the interview procedure.</p>
<p>Is it possible that this conversation is happening</p>
<p>inside a metaverse created by you,</p>
<p>by Meta many years from now,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing a memory replay experience?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d be some computer construct</p>
<p>and not the person who created that Meta company.</p>
<p>But that would truly be Meta.</p>
<p>Right, so this could be somebody else</p>
<p>using the Mark Zuckerberg avatar</p>
<p>who can do the Mark and the Lex conversation replay</p>
<p>from four decades ago when Meta, it was first sort of.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not gonna be four decades</p>
<p>before we have photorealistic avatars like this.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re much closer to that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s something you talk about</p>
<p>is how passionate you are about the idea</p>
<p>of the avatar representing who you are in the metaverse.</p>
<p>So I do these podcasts in person.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a stickler for that,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a magic to the in person conversation.</p>
<p>How long do you think it&rsquo;ll be before</p>
<p>you can have the same kind of magic in the metaverse,</p>
<p>the same kind of intimacy in the chemistry,</p>
<p>whatever the heck is there when we&rsquo;re talking in person?</p>
<p>How difficult is it?</p>
<p>How long before we have it in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Well, I think this is like the key question, right?</p>
<p>Because the thing that&rsquo;s different about virtual</p>
<p>and hopefully augmented reality</p>
<p>compared to all other forms of digital platforms before</p>
<p>is this feeling of presence, right?</p>
<p>The feeling that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in an experience</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re there with other people or in another place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just different from all of the other screens</p>
<p>that we have today, right?</p>
<p>Phones, TVs, all the stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to, in some cases, deliver experiences</p>
<p>that feel high fidelity,</p>
<p>but at no point do you actually feel like you&rsquo;re in it, right?</p>
<p>At some level, your content is trying to sort of convince you</p>
<p>that this is a realistic thing that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but all of the kind of subtle signals are telling you,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re looking at a screen.</p>
<p>So the question about how you develop these systems is like,</p>
<p>what are all of the things that make the physical world</p>
<p>all the different cues?</p>
<p>So I think on visual presence and spatial audio,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making reasonable progress.</p>
<p>Spatial audio makes a huge deal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve tried this experience,</p>
<p>workrooms that we launched where you have meetings.</p>
<p>And I basically made a rule for all of the top,</p>
<p>you know, management folks at the company</p>
<p>that they need to be doing standing meetings</p>
<p>in workrooms already, right?</p>
<p>I feel like we got to dog food this,</p>
<p>you know, this is how people are gonna work in the future.</p>
<p>So we have to adopt this now.</p>
<p>And there were already a lot of things</p>
<p>that I think feel significantly better</p>
<p>than like typical Zoom meetings,</p>
<p>even though the avatars are a lot lower fidelity.</p>
<p>You know, the idea that you have spatial audio,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re around a table in VR with people.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s talking from over there,</p>
<p>it sounds like it&rsquo;s talking from over there.</p>
<p>You can see, you know, the arm gestures</p>
<p>and stuff feel more natural.</p>
<p>You can have side conversations,</p>
<p>which is something that you can&rsquo;t really do in Zoom.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess you can text someone over,</p>
<p>like out of band,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re actually sitting around a table with people,</p>
<p>you know, you can lean over</p>
<p>and whisper to the person next to you</p>
<p>and like have a conversation that you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, that you can&rsquo;t really do</p>
<p>with in just video communication.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s interesting in what ways</p>
<p>some of these things already feel more real</p>
<p>than a lot of the technology that we have,</p>
<p>even when the visual fidelity isn&rsquo;t quite there,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;ll get there over the next few years.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, you were asking about comparing that</p>
<p>to the true physical world,</p>
<p>not Zoom or something like that.</p>
<p>And there, I mean, I think you have feelings</p>
<p>of like temperature, you know, olfactory,</p>
<p>obviously touch, right, we&rsquo;re working on haptic gloves,</p>
<p>you know, the sense that you wanna be able to,</p>
<p>you know, put your hands down</p>
<p>and feel some pressure from the table.</p>
<p>You know, all of these things</p>
<p>I think are gonna be really critical</p>
<p>to be able to keep up this illusion</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in a world</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re fully present in this world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of these building blocks</p>
<p>within, you know, the next 10 years or so.</p>
<p>And even before that, I think it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how much you&rsquo;re just gonna be able to build with software</p>
<p>that sort of masks some of these things.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m going long,</p>
<p>but I was told we have a few hours here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here for five to six hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, it&rsquo;s, look,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s on the shorter end</p>
<p>of the congressional testimonies I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, but, you know, one of the things</p>
<p>that we found with hand presence, right?</p>
<p>So the earliest VR, you just have the headset</p>
<p>and then, and that was cool, you could look around,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re in a place,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re really able to interact with it</p>
<p>until you have hands.</p>
<p>And then there was this big question</p>
<p>where once you got hands,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to represent them?</p>
<p>And initially, all of our assumptions was, okay,</p>
<p>when I look down and see my hands in the physical world,</p>
<p>I see an arm and it&rsquo;s gonna be super weird</p>
<p>if you see, you know, just your hand.</p>
<p>But it turned out to not be the case</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this issue with your arms,</p>
<p>which is like, what&rsquo;s your elbow angle?</p>
<p>And if the elbow angle that we&rsquo;re kind of interpolating</p>
<p>based on where your hand is and where your headset is</p>
<p>actually isn&rsquo;t accurate,</p>
<p>it creates this very uncomfortable feeling</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, oh, like my arm is actually out like this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like showing it in here.</p>
<p>And that actually broke the feeling of presence a lot more.</p>
<p>Whereas it turns out that if you just show the hands</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t show the arms,</p>
<p>it actually is fine for people.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of these interesting psychological cues</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;ll be more about getting the right details right.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of that will be possible</p>
<p>even over a few year period or a five year period.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t need like every single thing to be solved</p>
<p>to deliver this like full sense of presence.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a fascinating psychology question</p>
<p>of what is the essence</p>
<p>that makes in person conversation special?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like emojis are able to convey emotion really well,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re obviously not photorealistic.</p>
<p>And so in that same way, Jessica, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>just showing the hands is able</p>
<p>to create a comfortable expression with your hands.</p>
<p>So I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>People in the world wars used to write letters</p>
<p>and you can fall in love with just writing letters.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to see each other in person.</p>
<p>You can convey emotion.</p>
<p>You can be depth of experience with just words.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, a fascinating place</p>
<p>to explore psychology of like,</p>
<p>how do you find that intimacy?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the way that I come to all of this stuff is,</p>
<p>I basically studied psychology and computer science.</p>
<p>So all of the work that I do</p>
<p>is sort of at the intersection of those things.</p>
<p>I think most of the other big tech companies</p>
<p>are building technology for you to interact with.</p>
<p>What I care about is building technology</p>
<p>to help people interact with each other.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a somewhat different approach</p>
<p>than most of the other tech entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and big companies come at this from.</p>
<p>And a lot of the lessons</p>
<p>in terms of how I think about designing products</p>
<p>come from some just basic elements of psychology, right?</p>
<p>In terms of our brains,</p>
<p>you can compare it to the brains of other animals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very wired to specific things, facial expressions.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re very visual, right?</p>
<p>So compared to other animals,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s clearly the main sense</p>
<p>that most people have.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a whole part of your brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of focused on reading facial cues.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re designing the next version of Quest</p>
<p>or the VR headset, a big focus for us is face tracking</p>
<p>and basically eye tracking so you can make eye contact,</p>
<p>which again, isn&rsquo;t really something</p>
<p>that you can do over a video conference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of amazing how far video conferencing</p>
<p>has gotten without the ability to make eye contact, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a bizarre thing if you think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at someone&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>sometimes for an hour when you&rsquo;re in a meeting</p>
<p>and you looking at their eyes to them</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re looking at their eyes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always looking past each other, I guess.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not sending that signal.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re trying to.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re trying to.</p>
<p>A lot of times, or at least I find myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to look into the other person&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re looking to their eyes.</p>
<p>So then the question is,</p>
<p>all right, am I supposed to look at the camera</p>
<p>so that way you can have a sensation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m looking at you?</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>And then with VR today,</p>
<p>even without eye tracking</p>
<p>and knowing what your eyes are actually looking at,</p>
<p>you can fake it reasonably well, right?</p>
<p>So you can look at where the head pose is.</p>
<p>And if it looks like I&rsquo;m kind of looking</p>
<p>in your general direction,</p>
<p>then you can sort of assume</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s some eye contact intended</p>
<p>and you can do it in a way where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, maybe it&rsquo;s not a fixated stare,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somewhat natural.</p>
<p>But once you have actual eye tracking,</p>
<p>you can do it for real.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s really important stuff.</p>
<p>So when I think about Meta&rsquo;s contribution to this field,</p>
<p>I have to say it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>that any of the other companies</p>
<p>that are focused on the Metaverse</p>
<p>or on virtual and augmented reality</p>
<p>are gonna prioritize putting these features in the hardware</p>
<p>because like everything, they&rsquo;re trade offs, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it adds some weight to the device.</p>
<p>Maybe it adds some thickness.</p>
<p>You could totally see another company taking the approach</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s just make the lightest and thinnest thing possible.</p>
<p>But I want us to design the most human thing possible</p>
<p>that creates the richest sense of presence</p>
<p>and cause so much of human emotion and expression</p>
<p>comes from these like micro movements.</p>
<p>If I like move my eyebrow millimeter,</p>
<p>you will notice and that like means something.</p>
<p>So the fact that we&rsquo;re losing these signals</p>
<p>and a lot of communication I think is a loss.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, okay, there&rsquo;s one feature</p>
<p>and you add this, then it all of a sudden</p>
<p>is gonna feel like we have real presence.</p>
<p>You can sort of look at how the human brain works</p>
<p>and how we express and kind of read emotions</p>
<p>and you can just build a roadmap of that,</p>
<p>of just what are the most important things</p>
<p>to try to unlock over a five to 10 year period</p>
<p>and just try to make the experience</p>
<p>more and more human and social.</p>
<p>When do you think would be a moment,</p>
<p>like a singularity moment for the Metaverse</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to ask this question,</p>
<p>but people will have many or most</p>
<p>of their meaningful experiences</p>
<p>in the Metaverse versus the real world.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>the fact that a lot of people are having</p>
<p>the most important moments of their life</p>
<p>happen in the digital sphere,</p>
<p>especially not during COVID,</p>
<p>like even falling in love or meeting friends</p>
<p>or getting excited about stuff</p>
<p>that is happening on the 2D digital plane.</p>
<p>When do you think the Metaverse</p>
<p>will provide those experiences for a large number,</p>
<p>like a majority of the population?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>There was someone, I read this piece</p>
<p>that framed this as a lot of people think</p>
<p>that the Metaverse is about a place,</p>
<p>but one definition of this is it&rsquo;s about a time</p>
<p>when basically immersive digital worlds</p>
<p>become the primary way that we live our lives</p>
<p>and spend our time.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a reasonable construct.</p>
<p>And from that perspective,</p>
<p>I think you also just wanna look at this as a continuation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like, okay,</p>
<p>we are building digital worlds,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have that today.</p>
<p>I think you and I probably already live</p>
<p>a very large part of our life in digital worlds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not 3D immersive virtual reality,</p>
<p>but I do a lot of meetings over video</p>
<p>or I spend a lot of time writing things over email</p>
<p>or WhatsApp or whatever.</p>
<p>So what is it gonna take to get there</p>
<p>for kind of the immersive presence version of this,</p>
<p>which I think is what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>And for that, I think that there&rsquo;s just a bunch</p>
<p>of different use cases.</p>
<p>And I think when you&rsquo;re building technology,</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is just you&rsquo;re managing this duality</p>
<p>where on the one hand,</p>
<p>you wanna build these elegant things that can scale</p>
<p>and have billions of people use them</p>
<p>and get value from them.</p>
<p>And then on the other hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fighting this kind of ground game</p>
<p>where there are just a lot of different use cases</p>
<p>and people do different things</p>
<p>and you wanna be able to unlock them.</p>
<p>So the first ones that we basically went after</p>
<p>were gaming with Quest and social experiences.</p>
<p>And it goes back to when we started working</p>
<p>on virtual reality.</p>
<p>My theory at the time was basically</p>
<p>people thought about it as gaming,</p>
<p>but if you look at all computing platforms up to that point,</p>
<p>gaming is a huge part, it was a huge part of PCs,</p>
<p>it was a huge part of mobile,</p>
<p>but it was also very decentralized.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t, for the most part,</p>
<p>one or two gaming companies.</p>
<p>There were a lot of gaming companies</p>
<p>and gaming is somewhat hits based.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re getting some games that have more longevity,</p>
<p>but in general, there were a lot of different games</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>But on PC and on mobile,</p>
<p>the companies that focused on communication</p>
<p>and social interaction,</p>
<p>there tended to be a smaller number of those</p>
<p>and that ended up being just as important of a thing</p>
<p>as all of the games that you did combined.</p>
<p>I think productivity is another area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve historically been less focused on,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s gonna be really important for us.</p>
<p>With workroom, do you mean productivity</p>
<p>in the collaborative aspect?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there&rsquo;s a workroom&rsquo;s aspect of this,</p>
<p>like a meeting aspect,</p>
<p>and then I think that there&rsquo;s like a Word, Excel,</p>
<p>productivity, either you&rsquo;re working or coding</p>
<p>or knowledge work as opposed to just meetings.</p>
<p>So you can kind of go through all these different use cases.</p>
<p>Gaming, I think we&rsquo;re well on our way.</p>
<p>Social, I think we&rsquo;re just the kind of preeminent company</p>
<p>that focuses on this.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s already on Quest becoming the,</p>
<p>if you look at the list of what are the top apps,</p>
<p>social apps are already number one, two, three.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of becoming a critical thing, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would imagine for someone like you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be until we get a lot of the work things dialed in.</p>
<p>When this is just like much more adopted</p>
<p>and clearly better than Zoom for VC,</p>
<p>when if you&rsquo;re doing your coding or your writing</p>
<p>or whatever it is in VR,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s not that far off to imagine that</p>
<p>because pretty soon you&rsquo;re just gonna be able</p>
<p>to have a screen that&rsquo;s bigger than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be your ideal setup and you can bring it with you</p>
<p>and put it on anywhere</p>
<p>and have your kind of ideal workstation.</p>
<p>So I think that there are a few things to work out on that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s more than five years off.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get a bunch of other things</p>
<p>that like aren&rsquo;t even possible</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t even think about using a phone</p>
<p>or PC for today, like fitness, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I know you&rsquo;re, we were talking before</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re into running</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;m really into a lot of things</p>
<p>around fitness as well,</p>
<p>different things in different places.</p>
<p>I got really into hydrofoiling recently</p>
<p>and surfing and I used to fence competitively.</p>
<p>I like run.</p>
<p>So, and you were saying that you were thinking</p>
<p>about trying different martial arts</p>
<p>and I tried to trick you and convince you</p>
<p>into doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Or you actually mentioned that that was one</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re curious about and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is that a trick?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the metaverse now.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I took that seriously.</p>
<p>I thought that that was a real suggestion.</p>
<p>That would be an amazing chance</p>
<p>if we ever step on the mat together</p>
<p>and just like roll around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you some moves.</p>
<p>Well, give me a year to train and then we can do it.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve seen Rocky IV</p>
<p>where the Russian faces off the American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Russian in this picture.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re the Rocky, the underdog</p>
<p>that gets to win in the end.</p>
<p>The idea of me as Rocky and like fighting is&hellip;</p>
<p>If he dies, he dies.</p>
<p>Sorry, I just had to.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, a lot of aspects of fitness.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve tried supernatural</p>
<p>on Quest or&hellip;</p>
<p>So first of all, can I just comment on the fact</p>
<p>every time I played around with Quest 2,</p>
<p>I just, I get giddy every time I step into virtual reality.</p>
<p>So you mentioned productivity and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely something I&rsquo;m excited about,</p>
<p>but really I just love the possibilities</p>
<p>of stepping into that world.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the introvert in me,</p>
<p>but it just feels like the most convenient way</p>
<p>to travel into worlds,</p>
<p>into worlds that are similar to the real world</p>
<p>or totally different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p>Just try out crazy stuff.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>And I just, I personally am just love,</p>
<p>get excited for stepping in those virtual worlds.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>In terms of the productivity as a programmer,</p>
<p>I spend most of my day programming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting also,</p>
<p>but then you have to develop the right IDEs.</p>
<p>You have to develop, like there has to be a threshold</p>
<p>where a large amount of the programming community</p>
<p>moves there, but the collaborative aspects</p>
<p>that are possible in terms of meetings,</p>
<p>in terms of when two coders are working together,</p>
<p>I mean, the possibilities there are super, super exciting.</p>
<p>I think that in building this, we sort of need to balance.</p>
<p>There are gonna be some new things</p>
<p>that you just couldn&rsquo;t do before.</p>
<p>And those are gonna be the amazing experiences.</p>
<p>So teleporting to any place, right?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a real place or something that people made.</p>
<p>And I mean, some of the experiences</p>
<p>around how we can build stuff in new ways,</p>
<p>where a lot of the stuff that,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m coding stuff, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>you code it and then you build it</p>
<p>and then you see it afterwards.</p>
<p>But increasingly it&rsquo;s gonna be possible to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a world and you&rsquo;re building the world</p>
<p>as you are in it and kind of manipulating it.</p>
<p>One of the things that we showed at our Inside the Lab</p>
<p>for recent artificial intelligence progress</p>
<p>is this Builder Bot program,</p>
<p>where now you can just talk to it and say,</p>
<p>hey, okay, I&rsquo;m in this world,</p>
<p>like put some trees over there and it&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And like, all right, put some bottles of water</p>
<p>on our picnic blanket and it&rsquo;ll do that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the world.</p>
<p>And I think there are gonna be new paradigms for coding.</p>
<p>So yeah, there are gonna be some things</p>
<p>that I think are just pretty amazing,</p>
<p>especially the first few times that you do them,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re like, whoa,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve never had an experience like this.</p>
<p>But most of your life, I would imagine,</p>
<p>is not doing things that are amazing for the first time.</p>
<p>A lot of this in terms of,</p>
<p>I mean, just answering your question from before around,</p>
<p>what is it gonna take</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re spending most of your time in this?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, let me just say it as an aside,</p>
<p>the goal isn&rsquo;t to have people spend a lot more time</p>
<p>in computing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to make it so that. I&rsquo;m asking for myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s to make it. When will I spend all my time in?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s to make computing more natural.</p>
<p>But I think you will spend most of your computing time</p>
<p>in this when it does the things</p>
<p>that you use computing for somewhat better.</p>
<p>So maybe having your perfect workstation</p>
<p>is a 5% improvement on your coding productivity.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not like a completely new thing.</p>
<p>But I mean, look, if I could increase the productivity</p>
<p>of every engineer at Meta by 5%,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d buy those devices for everyone.</p>
<p>And I imagine a lot of other companies would too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you start getting to the scale</p>
<p>that I think makes this rival</p>
<p>some of the bigger computing platforms that exist today.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about identity.</p>
<p>We talked about the avatar.</p>
<p>How do you see identity in the Metaverse?</p>
<p>Should the avatar be tied to your identity</p>
<p>or can I be anything in the Metaverse?</p>
<p>Like, can I be whatever the heck I want?</p>
<p>Can I even be a troll?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s exciting freeing possibilities</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the darker possibilities too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s gonna be a range, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working on, for expression and avatars,</p>
<p>on one end of the spectrum are kind of expressive</p>
<p>and cartoonish avatars.</p>
<p>And then on the other end of the spectrum</p>
<p>are photorealistic avatars.</p>
<p>And I just think the reality is</p>
<p>that there are gonna be different use cases</p>
<p>for different things.</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s another axis.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going from photorealistic to expressive,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also like representing you directly</p>
<p>versus like some fantasy identity.</p>
<p>And I think that there are gonna be things</p>
<p>on all ends of that spectrum too, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll want photo, like in some experience,</p>
<p>you might wanna be like a photorealistic dragon, right?</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m playing Onward,</p>
<p>or just this military simulator game,</p>
<p>I think getting to be more photorealistic as a soldier</p>
<p>in that could enhance the experience.</p>
<p>There are times when I&rsquo;m hanging out with friends</p>
<p>where I want them to know it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>So a kind of cartoonish or expressive version of me is good.</p>
<p>But there are also experiences like,</p>
<p>VRChat does this well today,</p>
<p>where a lot of the experience is kind of dressing up</p>
<p>and wearing a fantastical avatar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost like a meme or is humorous.</p>
<p>So you come into an experience</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like you have like a built in icebreaker</p>
<p>because like you see people and you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>all right, I&rsquo;m cracking up at what you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, where&rsquo;d you get that?</p>
<p>Or, oh, you made that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Whereas, okay, if you&rsquo;re going into a work meeting,</p>
<p>maybe a photorealistic version of your real self</p>
<p>is gonna be the most appropriate thing for that.</p>
<p>So I think the reality is there aren&rsquo;t going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just gonna be one thing.</p>
<p>You know, my own sense of kind of how you wanna</p>
<p>express identity online has sort of evolved over time.</p>
<p>And that, you know, early days in Facebook,</p>
<p>I thought, okay, people are gonna have one identity.</p>
<p>And now I think that&rsquo;s clearly not gonna be the case.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna have all these different things</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s utility in being able to do different things.</p>
<p>So some of the technical challenges</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really interested in around it</p>
<p>are how do you build the software</p>
<p>to allow people to seamlessly go between them?</p>
<p>So say, so you could view them</p>
<p>as just completely discrete points on a spectrum,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about the metaverse economy for a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I buy a digital shirt</p>
<p>for my photorealistic avatar, which by the way,</p>
<p>I think at the time where we&rsquo;re spending a lot of time</p>
<p>in the metaverse doing a lot of our work meetings</p>
<p>in the metaverse and et cetera,</p>
<p>I would imagine that the economy around virtual clothing</p>
<p>as an example is going to be quite as big.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t I spend almost as much money</p>
<p>in investing in my appearance or expression</p>
<p>for my photorealistic avatar for meetings</p>
<p>as I would for whatever I&rsquo;m gonna wear in my video chat.</p>
<p>But the question is, okay, so you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you buy some shirt</p>
<p>for your photorealistic avatar.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if there was a way</p>
<p>to basically translate that into a more expressive thing</p>
<p>for your kind of cartoonish or expressive avatar?</p>
<p>And there are multiple ways to do that.</p>
<p>You can view them as two discrete points and okay,</p>
<p>maybe if a designer sells one thing,</p>
<p>then it actually comes in a pack and there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>and you can use either one on that,</p>
<p>but I actually think this stuff might exist more</p>
<p>as a spectrum in the future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I do think the direction</p>
<p>on some of the AI advances that is happening</p>
<p>to be able to, especially stuff around like style transfer,</p>
<p>being able to take a piece of art or express something</p>
<p>and say, okay, paint me this photo in the style of Gauguin</p>
<p>or whoever it is that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Take this shirt and put it in the style</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve designed for my expressive avatar.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna be pretty compelling.</p>
<p>And so the fashion, you might be buying like a generator,</p>
<p>like a closet that generates a style.</p>
<p>And then like with the GANs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to infinitely generate outfits</p>
<p>thereby making it, so the reason I wear the same thing</p>
<p>all the time is I don&rsquo;t like choice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the same thing,</p>
<p>but now you don&rsquo;t even have to choose.</p>
<p>Your closet generates your outfit for you every time.</p>
<p>So you have to live with the outfit it generates.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do that, although,</p>
<p>no, I think that that&rsquo;s, I think some people will,</p>
<p>but I think like, I think there&rsquo;s going to be a huge aspect</p>
<p>of just people doing creative commerce here.</p>
<p>So I think that there is going to be a big market</p>
<p>around people designing digital clothing.</p>
<p>But the question is, if you&rsquo;re designing digital clothing,</p>
<p>do you need to design, if you&rsquo;re the designer,</p>
<p>do you need to make it for each kind of specific discrete</p>
<p>point along a spectrum, or are you just designing it</p>
<p>for kind of a photo realistic case or an expressive case,</p>
<p>or can you design one</p>
<p>and have it translate across these things?</p>
<p>If I buy a style from a designer who I care about,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m a dragon, is there a way to morph that</p>
<p>so it goes on the dragon in a way that makes sense?</p>
<p>And that I think is an interesting AI problem</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re probably not going to make it</p>
<p>so that designers have to go design for all those things.</p>
<p>But the more useful the digital content is that you buy</p>
<p>in a lot of uses, in a lot of use cases,</p>
<p>the more that economy will just explode.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of what all of the,</p>
<p>we were joking about NFTs before,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of the promise here is that</p>
<p>if the digital goods that you buy are not just tied</p>
<p>to one platform or one use case,</p>
<p>they end up being more valuable,</p>
<p>which means that people are more willing</p>
<p>and more likely to invest in them,</p>
<p>and that just spurs the whole economy.</p>
<p>But the question is, that&rsquo;s a fascinating positive aspect,</p>
<p>but the potential negative aspect is that</p>
<p>you can have people concealing their identity</p>
<p>in order to troll or even not people, bots.</p>
<p>So how do you know in the metaverse</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking to a real human or an AI</p>
<p>or a well intentioned human?</p>
<p>Is that something you think about,</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re concerned about?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s break that down into a few different cases.</p>
<p>I mean, because knowing that you&rsquo;re talking to someone</p>
<p>who has good intentions is something that I think</p>
<p>is not even solved in pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you&rsquo;re talking to someone who&rsquo;s a dragon,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that they&rsquo;re not representing</p>
<p>themselves as a person.</p>
<p>I think probably the most pernicious thing</p>
<p>that you want to solve for is,</p>
<p>I think probably one of the scariest ones is</p>
<p>how do you make sure that someone isn&rsquo;t impersonating you?</p>
<p>So, okay, you&rsquo;re in a future version of this conversation,</p>
<p>and we have photorealistic avatars,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing this in work rooms</p>
<p>or whatever the future version of that is,</p>
<p>and someone walks in who looks like me.</p>
<p>How do you know that that&rsquo;s me?</p>
<p>And one of the things that we&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s still a pretty big AI project</p>
<p>to be able to generate photorealistic avatars</p>
<p>that basically can like,</p>
<p>they work like these codecs of you, right?</p>
<p>So you kind of have a map from your headset</p>
<p>and whatever sensors of what your body&rsquo;s actually doing,</p>
<p>and it takes the model and it kind of displays it in VR.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a question, which is,</p>
<p>should there be some sort of biometric security</p>
<p>so that when I put on my VR headset</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to go use that avatar,</p>
<p>I need to first prove that I am that?</p>
<p>And I think you probably are gonna want something like that.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re developing these technologies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also thinking about the security for things like that</p>
<p>because people aren&rsquo;t gonna wanna be impersonated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge security issue.</p>
<p>Then you just get the question</p>
<p>of people hiding behind fake accounts</p>
<p>to do malicious things,</p>
<p>which is not gonna be unique to the metaverse,</p>
<p>although certainly in a environment</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more immersive</p>
<p>and you have more of a sense of presence,</p>
<p>it could be more painful.</p>
<p>But this is obviously something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve just dealt with for years</p>
<p>in social media and the internet more broadly.</p>
<p>And there, I think there have been a bunch of tactics</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;ve just evolved to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built up these different AI systems</p>
<p>to basically get a sense of,</p>
<p>is this account behaving in the way that a person would?</p>
<p>And it turns out,</p>
<p>so in all of the work that we&rsquo;ve done around,</p>
<p>we call it community integrity</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically like policing harmful content</p>
<p>and trying to figure out where to draw the line.</p>
<p>And there are all these like really hard</p>
<p>and philosophical questions around like,</p>
<p>where do you draw the line on some of this stuff?</p>
<p>And the thing that I&rsquo;ve kind of found the most effective</p>
<p>is as much as possible trying to figure out</p>
<p>who are the inauthentic accounts</p>
<p>or where are the accounts that are behaving</p>
<p>in an overall harmful way at the account level,</p>
<p>rather than trying to get into like policing</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying, right?</p>
<p>Which I think the metaverse is gonna be even harder</p>
<p>because the metaverse I think will have more properties of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost more like a phone call, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s not like I post a piece of content</p>
<p>and is that piece of content good or bad?</p>
<p>So I think more of this stuff will have to be done</p>
<p>at the level of the account.</p>
<p>But this is the area where,</p>
<p>between the kind of counter intelligence teams</p>
<p>that we built up inside the company</p>
<p>and like years of building just different AI systems</p>
<p>to basically detect what is a real account and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re perfect,</p>
<p>but like this is an area where I just think</p>
<p>we are like years ahead of basically anyone else</p>
<p>in the industry in terms of having built those capabilities.</p>
<p>And I think that that just is gonna be incredibly important</p>
<p>for this next wave of things.</p>
<p>And like you said, on a technical level,</p>
<p>on a philosophical level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>By the way, I would probably like to open source my avatar</p>
<p>so there could be like millions of Lexis walking around</p>
<p>just like an army.</p>
<p>Like Agent Smith?</p>
<p>Agent Smith, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So the Unity ML folks built a copy of me</p>
<p>and they sent it to me.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a person running around</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve just been doing reinforcement learning on it.</p>
<p>I was gonna release it</p>
<p>because just to have sort of like thousands of Lexis</p>
<p>doing reinforcement.</p>
<p>So they fall over naturally,</p>
<p>they have to learn how to like walk around and stuff.</p>
<p>So I love that idea,</p>
<p>this tension between biometric security,</p>
<p>you want to have one identity,</p>
<p>but then certain avatars, you might have to have many.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is better security,</p>
<p>sort of flooding the world with Lexis</p>
<p>and thereby achieving security</p>
<p>or really being protective of your identity.</p>
<p>I have to ask you a security question actually.</p>
<p>Well, how does flooding the world with Lexis help me know</p>
<p>in our conversation that I&rsquo;m talking to the real Lex?</p>
<p>I completely destroy the trust</p>
<p>in all my relationships then, right?</p>
<p>If I flood,</p>
<p>cause then it&rsquo;s, yeah, that.</p>
<p>I think that one&rsquo;s not gonna work that well for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna work that well for the original copy.</p>
<p>It probably fits some things.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a public figure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to have a bunch of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to show up</p>
<p>in a bunch of different places in the future,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to do that in the metaverse.</p>
<p>So that kind of replication I think will be useful.</p>
<p>But I do think that you&rsquo;re gonna want a notion of like,</p>
<p>I am talking to the real one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially if the fake ones start outperforming you</p>
<p>and all your private relationships</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re left behind.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a serious concern I have with clones.</p>
<p>Again, the things I think about.</p>
<p>Okay, so I recently got, I use QNAP NAS storage.</p>
<p>So just storage for video and stuff.</p>
<p>And I recently got hacked.</p>
<p>This is the first time for me with ransomware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not me personally, it&rsquo;s all QNAP devices.</p>
<p>So the question that people have</p>
<p>is about security in general.</p>
<p>Because I was doing a lot of the right things</p>
<p>in terms of security and nevertheless,</p>
<p>ransomware basically disabled my device.</p>
<p>Is that something you think about?</p>
<p>What are the different steps you could take</p>
<p>to protect people&rsquo;s data on the security front?</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s different solutions for,</p>
<p>and strategies where it makes sense to have stuff</p>
<p>kind of put behind a fortress, right?</p>
<p>So the centralized model versus the decentralizing.</p>
<p>Then I think both have strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>So I think anyone who says, okay,</p>
<p>just decentralize everything, that&rsquo;ll make it more secure.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s tough because,</p>
<p>I mean, the advantage of something like encryption</p>
<p>is that we run the largest encrypted service</p>
<p>in the world with WhatsApp.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re one of the first to roll out</p>
<p>a multi platform encryption service.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I think was a big advance</p>
<p>for the industry.</p>
<p>And one of the promises that we can basically make</p>
<p>because of that, our company doesn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sending an encrypted message</p>
<p>and to an encrypted message,</p>
<p>what the content is of what you&rsquo;re sharing.</p>
<p>So that way, if someone hacks Meta servers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to access the WhatsApp message</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sending to your friend.</p>
<p>And that I think matters a lot to people</p>
<p>because obviously if someone is able to compromise</p>
<p>a company&rsquo;s servers and that company has hundreds</p>
<p>of millions or billions of people,</p>
<p>then that ends up being a very big deal.</p>
<p>The flip side of that is, okay,</p>
<p>all the content is on your phone.</p>
<p>Are you following security best practices on your phone?</p>
<p>If you lose your phone, all your content is gone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>Maybe you go back up your content from WhatsApp</p>
<p>or some other service in an iCloud or something,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re just at Apple&rsquo;s whims about,</p>
<p>are they gonna go turn over the data to some government</p>
<p>or are they gonna get hacked?</p>
<p>So a lot of the time it is useful to have data</p>
<p>in a centralized place too because then you can train</p>
<p>systems that can just do much better personalization.</p>
<p>I think that in a lot of cases, centralized systems</p>
<p>can offer, especially if you&rsquo;re a serious company,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running the state of the art stuff</p>
<p>and you have red teams attacking your own stuff</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting out bounty programs</p>
<p>and trying to attract some of the best hackers in the world</p>
<p>to go break into your stuff all the time.</p>
<p>So any system is gonna have security issues,</p>
<p>but I think the best way forward is to basically try</p>
<p>to be as aggressive and open about hardening</p>
<p>the systems as possible, not trying to kind of hide</p>
<p>and pretend that there aren&rsquo;t gonna be issues,</p>
<p>which I think is over time why a lot of open source systems</p>
<p>have gotten relatively more secure is because they&rsquo;re open</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not, rather than pretending that there aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be issues, just people surface them quicker.</p>
<p>So I think you want to adopt that approach as a company</p>
<p>and just constantly be hardening yourself.</p>
<p>Trying to stay one step ahead of the attackers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inherently adversarial space.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an interesting security is interesting</p>
<p>because of the different kind of threats</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve managed over the last five years,</p>
<p>there are ones where basically the adversaries</p>
<p>keep on getting better and better.</p>
<p>So trying to kind of interfere with security</p>
<p>is certainly one area of this.</p>
<p>If you have nation states that are trying</p>
<p>to interfere in elections or something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of evolving their tactics.</p>
<p>Whereas on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t want to be too simplistic</p>
<p>about it, but if someone is saying something hateful,</p>
<p>people usually aren&rsquo;t getting smarter and smarter</p>
<p>about how they say hateful things.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s some element of that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very small dynamic compared</p>
<p>to how advanced attackers and some of these other places</p>
<p>get over time.</p>
<p>I believe most people are good,</p>
<p>so they actually get better over time</p>
<p>and not being less hateful</p>
<p>because they realize it&rsquo;s not fun being hateful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at least the belief I have.</p>
<p>But first, bathroom break.</p>
<p>Sure, okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll come back to AI,</p>
<p>but let me ask some difficult questions now.</p>
<p>Social Dilemma is a popular documentary</p>
<p>that raised concerns about the effects</p>
<p>of social media on society.</p>
<p>You responded with a point by point rebuttal titled,</p>
<p>What the Social Dilemma Gets Wrong.</p>
<p>People should read that.</p>
<p>I would say the key point they make</p>
<p>is because social media is funded by ads,</p>
<p>algorithms want to maximize attention and engagement</p>
<p>and an effective way to do so is to get people angry</p>
<p>at each other, increase division and so on.</p>
<p>Can you steel man their criticisms and arguments</p>
<p>that they make in the documentary</p>
<p>as a way to understand the concern</p>
<p>and as a way to respond to it?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a good conversation to have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t happen to agree with the conclusions</p>
<p>and I think that they make a few assumptions</p>
<p>that are just very big jumps</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think are reasonable to make.</p>
<p>But I understand overall why people would be concerned</p>
<p>that our business model and ads in general,</p>
<p>we do make more money</p>
<p>as people use the service more in general, right?</p>
<p>So as a kind of basic assumption, okay,</p>
<p>do we have an incentive for people to build a service</p>
<p>that people use more?</p>
<p>Yes, on a lot of levels.</p>
<p>I mean, we think what we&rsquo;re doing is good.</p>
<p>So we think that if people are finding it useful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll use it more.</p>
<p>Or if you just look at it as this sort of,</p>
<p>if the only thing we cared about is money,</p>
<p>which is not for anyone who knows me,</p>
<p>but okay, we&rsquo;re a company.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you just kind of simplified it down to that,</p>
<p>then would we want people to use the services more?</p>
<p>Yes, and then you get to the second question,</p>
<p>which is does kind of getting people agitated</p>
<p>make them more likely to use the services more?</p>
<p>And I think from looking at other media in the world,</p>
<p>especially TV, and there&rsquo;s the old news adage,</p>
<p>if it bleeds, it leads.</p>
<p>Like I think that this is,</p>
<p>there are a bunch of reasons why someone might think</p>
<p>that that kind of provocative content</p>
<p>would be the most engaging.</p>
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;ve always found is two things.</p>
<p>One is that what grabs someone&rsquo;s attention in the near term</p>
<p>is not necessarily something</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to appreciate having seen</p>
<p>or going to be the best over the long term.</p>
<p>So I think what a lot of people get wrong</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m not building this company</p>
<p>to make the most money or get people to spend the most time</p>
<p>on this in the next quarter or the next year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 17 years at this point,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still relatively young,</p>
<p>and I have a lot more that I wanna do</p>
<p>over the coming decades.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s too simplistic to say,</p>
<p>hey, this might increase time in the near term,</p>
<p>therefore, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>Because I actually think a deeper look</p>
<p>at kind of what my incentives are,</p>
<p>the incentives of a company</p>
<p>that are focused on the long term,</p>
<p>is to basically do what people</p>
<p>are gonna find valuable over time,</p>
<p>not what is gonna draw people&rsquo;s attention today.</p>
<p>The other thing that I&rsquo;d say is that,</p>
<p>I think a lot of times people look at this</p>
<p>from the perspective of media</p>
<p>or kind of information or civic discourse,</p>
<p>but one other way of looking at this is just that,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m a product designer, right?</p>
<p>Our company, we build products,</p>
<p>and a big part of building a product</p>
<p>is not just the function and utility</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re delivering,</p>
<p>but the feeling of how it feels, right?</p>
<p>And we spend a lot of time talking about virtual reality</p>
<p>and how the kind of key aspect of that experience</p>
<p>is the feeling of presence, which it&rsquo;s a visceral thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the utility that you&rsquo;re delivering,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about like the sensation.</p>
<p>And similarly, I care a lot about how people feel</p>
<p>when they use our products,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to build products that make people angry.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like not, I think,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re here on this earth to do,</p>
<p>is to build something that people spend a bunch of time doing</p>
<p>and it just kind of makes them angrier at other people.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I think would be</p>
<p>sort of a good use of our time</p>
<p>or a good contribution to the world.</p>
<p>So, okay, it&rsquo;s like people, they tell us</p>
<p>on a per content basis, does this thing,</p>
<p>do I like it?</p>
<p>Do I love it?</p>
<p>Does it make me angry?</p>
<p>Does it make me sad?</p>
<p>And based on that, we choose to basically show content</p>
<p>that makes people angry less,</p>
<p>because of course, if you&rsquo;re designing a product</p>
<p>and you want people to be able to connect</p>
<p>and feel good over a long period of time,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s naturally what you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, I think overall,</p>
<p>I understand at a high level,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not thinking too deeply about it,</p>
<p>why that argument might be appealing.</p>
<p>But I just think if you actually look</p>
<p>at what our real incentives are,</p>
<p>not just like if we were trying to optimize</p>
<p>for the next week,</p>
<p>but like as people working on this,</p>
<p>like why are we here?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not actually how you would wanna</p>
<p>design the system.</p>
<p>I guess one other thing that I&rsquo;d say is that,</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re focused on the ads business model,</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important to note that a lot</p>
<p>of these issues are not unique to ads.</p>
<p>I mean, so take like a subscription news business model,</p>
<p>for example, I think that has just as many</p>
<p>potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Maybe if someone&rsquo;s paying for a subscription,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get paid per piece of content that they look at,</p>
<p>but say for example, I think like a bunch</p>
<p>of the partisanship that we see could potentially</p>
<p>be made worse by you have these kind of partisan</p>
<p>news organizations that basically sell subscriptions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only gonna get people on one side</p>
<p>to basically subscribe to them.</p>
<p>So their incentive is not to print content</p>
<p>or produce content that&rsquo;s kind of centrist</p>
<p>or down the line either.</p>
<p>I bet that what a lot of them find is that</p>
<p>if they produce stuff that&rsquo;s kind of more polarizing</p>
<p>or more partisan, then that is what gets</p>
<p>the more subscribers.</p>
<p>So I think that this stuff is all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no perfect business model.</p>
<p>Everything has pitfalls.</p>
<p>The thing that I think is great about advertising</p>
<p>is it makes it so the consumer service is free,</p>
<p>which if you believe that everyone should have a voice</p>
<p>and everyone should be able to connect,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a great thing, as opposed to building</p>
<p>a luxury service that not everyone can afford.</p>
<p>But look, every business model, you have to be careful</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re implementing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You responded to a few things there.</p>
<p>You spoke to the fact that there is a narrative</p>
<p>of malevolence, like you&rsquo;re leaning into them,</p>
<p>making people angry just because it makes more money</p>
<p>in the short term, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So you responded to that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also kind of reality of human nature.</p>
<p>Just like you spoke about, there&rsquo;s fights,</p>
<p>arguments we get in and we don&rsquo;t like ourselves afterwards,</p>
<p>but we got into them anyway.</p>
<p>So our longterm growth is, I believe for most of us,</p>
<p>has to do with learning, challenging yourself,</p>
<p>improving, being kind to each other,</p>
<p>finding a community of people that you connect with</p>
<p>on a real human level, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But it does seem when you look at social media</p>
<p>that a lot of fights break out,</p>
<p>a lot of arguments break out,</p>
<p>a lot of viral content ends up being sort of outrage</p>
<p>in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s easy from that to infer the narrative</p>
<p>that social media companies are letting</p>
<p>this outrage become viral.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re increasing the division in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps you can comment on that</p>
<p>or further, how can you be,</p>
<p>how can you push back on this narrative?</p>
<p>How can you be transparent about this battle?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s not just motivation or financials,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a technical problem too,</p>
<p>which is how do you improve longterm wellbeing</p>
<p>of human beings?</p>
<p>I think that going through some of the design decisions</p>
<p>would be a good conversation.</p>
<p>But first, I actually think,</p>
<p>I think you acknowledged that,</p>
<p>that narrative is somewhat anecdotal.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s worth grounding this conversation</p>
<p>in the actual research that has been done on this,</p>
<p>which by and large finds that social media</p>
<p>is not a large driver of polarization, right?</p>
<p>And, I mean, there&rsquo;s been a number of economists</p>
<p>and social scientists and folks who have studied this.</p>
<p>In a lot of polarization, it varies around the world.</p>
<p>If social media is basically in every country,</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s in pretty much every country</p>
<p>except for China and maybe North Korea.</p>
<p>And you see different trends in different places</p>
<p>where in a lot of countries polarization is declining,</p>
<p>in some it&rsquo;s flat, in the US it&rsquo;s risen sharply.</p>
<p>So the question is, what are the unique phenomenon</p>
<p>in the different places?</p>
<p>And I think for the people who are trying to say,</p>
<p>hey, social media is the thing that&rsquo;s doing this.</p>
<p>I think that that clearly doesn&rsquo;t hold up</p>
<p>because social media is a phenomenon</p>
<p>that is pretty much equivalent</p>
<p>in all of these different countries.</p>
<p>And you have researchers like this economist at Stanford,</p>
<p>Matthew Genskow, who has just written at length about this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bunch of books by political scientists,</p>
<p>Ezra Klein and folks, why we&rsquo;re polarized,</p>
<p>basically goes through this decades long analysis in the US.</p>
<p>Before I was born, basically talking about</p>
<p>some of the forces in kind of partisan politics</p>
<p>and Fox News and different things</p>
<p>that predate the internet in a lot of ways</p>
<p>that I think are likely larger contributors.</p>
<p>So to the contrary on this,</p>
<p>not only is it pretty clear that social media</p>
<p>is not a major contributor,</p>
<p>but most of the academic studies that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>actually show that social media use</p>
<p>is correlated with lower polarization.</p>
<p>And Genskow, the same person who just did the study</p>
<p>that I cited about longitudinal polarization</p>
<p>across different countries,</p>
<p>also did a study that basically showed</p>
<p>that if you looked after the 2016 election in the US,</p>
<p>the voters who were the most polarized</p>
<p>were actually the ones who were not on the internet.</p>
<p>So, and there have been recent other studies,</p>
<p>I think in Europe and around the world,</p>
<p>basically showing that as people stop using social media,</p>
<p>they tend to get more polarized.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a deeper analysis around,</p>
<p>okay, well, polarization actually isn&rsquo;t even one thing.</p>
<p>Cause you know, having different opinions on something</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s by itself bad.</p>
<p>What people who study this say is most problematic</p>
<p>is what they call affective polarization,</p>
<p>which is basically are you,</p>
<p>do you have negative feelings towards people</p>
<p>of another group?</p>
<p>And the way that a lot of scholars study this</p>
<p>is they basically ask a group,</p>
<p>would you let your kids marry someone of group X?</p>
<p>Whatever the groups are that you&rsquo;re worried</p>
<p>that someone might have negative feelings towards.</p>
<p>And in general, use of social media</p>
<p>has corresponded to decreases</p>
<p>in that kind of affective polarization.</p>
<p>So I just wanna, I think we should talk</p>
<p>through the design decisions and how we handle</p>
<p>the kind of specific pieces of content,</p>
<p>but overall, I think it&rsquo;s just worth grounding</p>
<p>that discussion in the research that&rsquo;s existed</p>
<p>that I think overwhelmingly shows</p>
<p>that the mainstream narrative around this</p>
<p>is just not right.</p>
<p>But the narrative does take hold</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s compelling to a lot of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another question I&rsquo;d like to ask you on this.</p>
<p>I was looking at various polls and saw that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>one of the most disliked tech leaders today,</p>
<p>54% unfavorable rating.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is 23%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically everybody has a very high unfavorable rating</p>
<p>that are tech leaders.</p>
<p>Maybe you can help me understand that.</p>
<p>Why do you think so many people dislike you?</p>
<p>Some even hate you.</p>
<p>And how do you regain their trust and support?</p>
<p>Given everything you just said,</p>
<p>why are you losing the battle</p>
<p>in explaining to people what actual impact</p>
<p>social media has on society?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m curious if that&rsquo;s a US survey or world.</p>
<p>It is US, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a few dynamics.</p>
<p>One is that our brand</p>
<p>has been somewhat uniquely challenged in the US</p>
<p>compared to other places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that there are.</p>
<p>I mean, other countries, we have issues too,</p>
<p>but I think in the US, there was this dynamic where</p>
<p>if you look at like the next sentiment</p>
<p>of kind of coverage or attitude towards us,</p>
<p>before 2016, I think that there were probably</p>
<p>very few months, if any, where it was negative.</p>
<p>And since 2016, I think that there probably</p>
<p>been very few months, if any, then it&rsquo;s been positive.</p>
<p>Politics.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a specific thing.</p>
<p>And this is very different from other places.</p>
<p>So I think in a lot of other countries in the world,</p>
<p>the sentiment towards meta and our services</p>
<p>is extremely positive.</p>
<p>In the US, we have more challenges.</p>
<p>And I think compared to other companies,</p>
<p>you can look at certain industries,</p>
<p>I think if you look at it from like a partisan perspective,</p>
<p>not from like a political perspective,</p>
<p>but just kind of culturally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there are people who are probably</p>
<p>more left of center and there are people</p>
<p>who are more right of center,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s kind of blue America and red America.</p>
<p>There are certain industries that I think</p>
<p>maybe one half of the country has a more positive view</p>
<p>towards than another.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re in a,</p>
<p>one of the positions that we&rsquo;re in that I think</p>
<p>is really challenging is that because of a lot</p>
<p>of the content decisions that we&rsquo;ve basically</p>
<p>had to arbitrate, and because we&rsquo;re not a partisan company,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not a Democrat company or a Republican company,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to make the best decisions we can</p>
<p>to help people connect and help people have as much voice</p>
<p>as they can while having some rules</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re running a community.</p>
<p>The net effect of that is that we&rsquo;re kind of constantly</p>
<p>making decisions that piss off people in both camps.</p>
<p>And the effect that I&rsquo;ve sort of seen is that</p>
<p>when we make a decision that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a controversial one that&rsquo;s gonna upset,</p>
<p>say about half the country,</p>
<p>those decisions are all negative sum,</p>
<p>from a brand perspective, because it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>if we make that decision in one way</p>
<p>and say half the country is happy</p>
<p>about that particular decision that we make,</p>
<p>they tend to not say, oh, sweet, meta got that one right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, ah, you didn&rsquo;t mess that one up.</p>
<p>But their opinion doesn&rsquo;t tend to go up by that much.</p>
<p>Whereas the people who kind of are on the other side of it</p>
<p>are like, God, how could you mess that up?</p>
<p>How could you possibly think that that piece of content</p>
<p>is okay and should be up and should not be censored?</p>
<p>Or, and so I think the, whereas if you leave it up</p>
<p>and, you know, it&rsquo;s, or if you take it down,</p>
<p>the people who thought it should be taken down or,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like, all right, fine, great.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t mess that one up.</p>
<p>So our internal assessment of,</p>
<p>and the kind of analytics on our brand</p>
<p>are basically anytime one of these big controversial things</p>
<p>comes up in society,</p>
<p>our brand goes down with half of the country.</p>
<p>And then like, if you,</p>
<p>and then if you just kind of extrapolate that out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just been very challenging for us to try to navigate</p>
<p>what is a polarizing country in a principled way,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not trying to kind of hew to one side</p>
<p>or the other, we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>what we think is the right thing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I think is the right thing</p>
<p>for us to do though.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll try to keep doing.</p>
<p>Just as a human being, how does it feel though,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re giving so much of your day to day life</p>
<p>to try to heal division, to try to do good in the world,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about, that so many people in the US,</p>
<p>the place you call home have a negative view</p>
<p>of you as a leader, as a human being</p>
<p>and the company you love?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s not great,</p>
<p>but I mean, look, if I wanted people to think positively</p>
<p>about me as a person,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not sure if you go build a company.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Or a social media company.</p>
<p>It seems exceptionally difficult to do</p>
<p>with a social media company.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there is a dynamic where a lot of the other people</p>
<p>running these companies, internet companies,</p>
<p>have sort of stepped back and they just do things</p>
<p>that are sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, less controversial.</p>
<p>And some of it may be that they just get tired over time.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, running a company is hard,</p>
<p>building something at scale is hard.</p>
<p>You only really do it for a long period of time</p>
<p>if you really care about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And yeah, so, I mean, it&rsquo;s not great, but like,</p>
<p>but look, I think that at some level,</p>
<p>whether 25% of people dislike you</p>
<p>or 75% of people dislike you,</p>
<p>your experience as a public figure is gonna be</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of people who dislike you, right?</p>
<p>So, I actually am not sure how different it is.</p>
<p>You know, certainly, you know,</p>
<p>the country&rsquo;s gotten more polarized</p>
<p>and we in particular have gotten, you know,</p>
<p>more controversial over the last five or years or so.</p>
<p>But, I don&rsquo;t know, I kind of think like as a public figure</p>
<p>and leader of one of these enterprises.</p>
<p>Comes with the job.</p>
<p>Yeah, part of what you do is like,</p>
<p>and look, the answer can&rsquo;t just be ignore it, right?</p>
<p>Because like a huge part of the job</p>
<p>is like you need to be getting feedback</p>
<p>and internalizing feedback on how you can do better.</p>
<p>But I think increasingly what you need to do</p>
<p>is be able to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>who are the kind of good faith critics</p>
<p>who are criticizing you because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to help you do a better job</p>
<p>rather than tear you down.</p>
<p>And those are the people I just think you have to cherish</p>
<p>and like, and listen very closely</p>
<p>to the things that they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>because, you know, I think it&rsquo;s just as dangerous</p>
<p>to tune out everyone who says anything negative</p>
<p>and just listen to the people who are kind of positive</p>
<p>and support you, you know,</p>
<p>as it would be psychologically to pay attention</p>
<p>trying to make people who are never gonna like you like you.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s just kind of a dance</p>
<p>that people have to do.</p>
<p>But I mean, I, you know,</p>
<p>so you kind of develop more of a feel for like,</p>
<p>who actually is trying to accomplish</p>
<p>the same types of things in the world</p>
<p>and who has different ideas about how to do that</p>
<p>and how can I learn from those people?</p>
<p>And like, yeah, we get stuff wrong.</p>
<p>And when the people whose opinions I respect</p>
<p>call me out on getting stuff wrong,</p>
<p>that hurts and makes me wanna do better.</p>
<p>But I think at this point, I&rsquo;m pretty tuned to just,</p>
<p>all right, if someone, if I know they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like operating in bad faith</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not really trying to help,</p>
<p>then, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, I think over time,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t bother you that much.</p>
<p>But you are surrounded by people that believe in the mission</p>
<p>that love you.</p>
<p>Are there friends or colleagues in your inner circle</p>
<p>you trust that call you out on your bullshit</p>
<p>whenever your thinking may be misguided</p>
<p>as it is for leaders at times?</p>
<p>I think we have a famously open company culture</p>
<p>where we sort of encourage that kind of dissent internally,</p>
<p>which is, you know, why there&rsquo;s so much material</p>
<p>internally that can leak out</p>
<p>with people sort of disagreeing</p>
<p>is because that&rsquo;s sort of the culture.</p>
<p>You know, our management team, I think it&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>you know, there are some newer folks who come in,</p>
<p>there are some folks who&rsquo;ve kind of been there for a while,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very high level of trust.</p>
<p>And I would say it is a relatively confrontational</p>
<p>group of people.</p>
<p>And my friends and family, I think, will push me on this.</p>
<p>But look, it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>but I think you need some diversity, right?</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be, you know,</p>
<p>people who are your friends and family.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, you know, I mean, there are journalists</p>
<p>or analysts or, you know,</p>
<p>peer executives at other companies</p>
<p>or, you know, other people who sort of are insightful</p>
<p>about thinking about the world,</p>
<p>you know, certain politicians</p>
<p>or people kind of in that sphere</p>
<p>who I just think have like very insightful perspectives</p>
<p>who even if they would,</p>
<p>they come at the world from a different perspective,</p>
<p>which is sort of what makes the perspective so valuable.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think fundamentally</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to get to the same place</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, helping people connect more,</p>
<p>helping the whole world function better,</p>
<p>not just, you know, one place or another.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I mean,</p>
<p>those are the people whose opinions really matter to me.</p>
<p>And I just, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I learn on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>People are constantly sending me comments on stuff</p>
<p>or links to things they found interesting.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s kind of constantly evolving</p>
<p>this model of the world</p>
<p>and kind of what we should be aspiring to be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about, you have a famously open culture</p>
<p>which comes with the criticism</p>
<p>and the painful experiences.</p>
<p>So let me ask you another difficult question.</p>
<p>Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower,</p>
<p>leaked the internal Instagram research</p>
<p>into teenagers and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Her claim is that Instagram is choosing profit</p>
<p>over wellbeing of teenage girls.</p>
<p>So Instagram is quote, toxic for them.</p>
<p>Your response titled,</p>
<p>what our research really says about teen wellbeing</p>
<p>and Instagram says, no, Instagram research shows</p>
<p>that 11 of 12 wellbeing issues,</p>
<p>teenage girls who said they struggle</p>
<p>with those difficult issues also said</p>
<p>that Instagram made them better rather than worse.</p>
<p>Again, can you steal man and defend the point</p>
<p>and Frances Haugen&rsquo;s characterization of the study</p>
<p>and then help me understand the positive</p>
<p>and negative effects of Instagram</p>
<p>and Facebook on young people?</p>
<p>So there are certainly questions around teen mental health</p>
<p>that are really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, as a parent, it&rsquo;s like hard to imagine</p>
<p>any set of questions that are sort of more important.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess maybe other aspects of physical health</p>
<p>or wellbeing are probably come to that level,</p>
<p>but like, these are really important questions, right?</p>
<p>Which is why we dedicate teams to studying them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the internet or social media are unique</p>
<p>in having these questions.</p>
<p>I mean, I think people and there&rsquo;ve been sort of magazines</p>
<p>with promoting certain body types for women</p>
<p>and kids for decades,</p>
<p>but we really care about this stuff.</p>
<p>So we wanted to study it.</p>
<p>And of course, we didn&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>that everything was gonna be positive all the time.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the reason why you study this stuff</p>
<p>is to try to improve and get better.</p>
<p>So, I mean, look, the place where I disagree</p>
<p>with the characterization first,</p>
<p>I thought some of the reporting and coverage of it</p>
<p>just took the whole thing out of proportion</p>
<p>and that it focused on, as you said,</p>
<p>I think there were like 20 metrics in there</p>
<p>and on 18 or 19, the effect of using Instagram</p>
<p>was neutral or positive on the teen&rsquo;s wellbeing.</p>
<p>And there was one area where I think it showed</p>
<p>that we needed to improve</p>
<p>and we took some steps to try to do that</p>
<p>after doing the research.</p>
<p>But I think having the coverage just focus on that one</p>
<p>without focusing on the,</p>
<p>I mean, I think an accurate characterization</p>
<p>would have been that kids using Instagram</p>
<p>or not kids, teens is generally positive</p>
<p>for their mental health.</p>
<p>But of course, that was not the narrative that came out.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s hard to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a kind of logical thing to straw man,</p>
<p>but I sort of disagree or steel man,</p>
<p>but I sort of disagree with that overall characterization.</p>
<p>I think anyone sort of looking at this objectively would,</p>
<p>but then, I mean, there is this sort of intent critique</p>
<p>that I think you were getting at before,</p>
<p>which says, it assumes some sort of malevolence, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, which it&rsquo;s really hard for me</p>
<p>to really wrap my head around this</p>
<p>because as far as I know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear that any of the other tech companies</p>
<p>are doing this kind of research.</p>
<p>So why the narrative should form that we did research</p>
<p>because we were studying an issue</p>
<p>because we wanted to understand it to improve</p>
<p>and took steps after that to try to improve it,</p>
<p>that your interpretation of that would be</p>
<p>that we did the research</p>
<p>and tried to sweep it under the rug.</p>
<p>It just, it sort of is like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beyond credibility to me</p>
<p>that like that&rsquo;s the accurate description of the actions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve taken compared to the others in the industry.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s my view on it.</p>
<p>These are really important issues</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re gonna be working on</p>
<p>related to teen mental health for a long time,</p>
<p>including trying to understand this better.</p>
<p>And I would encourage everyone else</p>
<p>in the industry to do this too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love there to be open conversations</p>
<p>and a lot of great research being released internally</p>
<p>and then also externally.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good</p>
<p>to see press obviously get way more clicks</p>
<p>when they say negative things about social media.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, I can just tell</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s hunger to say negative things</p>
<p>about social media.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand how that&rsquo;s supposed to lead</p>
<p>to an open conversation about the positives</p>
<p>and the negatives, the concerns about social media,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re doing that kind of research.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that,</p>
<p>but let me ask you as a father,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weight heavy on you</p>
<p>that people get bullied on social networks.</p>
<p>So people get bullied in their private life.</p>
<p>But now because so much of our life is in the digital world,</p>
<p>the bullying moves from the physical world</p>
<p>to the digital world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now creating a platform</p>
<p>on which bullying happens.</p>
<p>And some of that bullying can lead to damage</p>
<p>to mental health.</p>
<p>And some of that bullying can lead to depression,</p>
<p>even suicide.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a weight heavy on you</p>
<p>that people have committed suicide</p>
<p>or will commit suicide based on the bullying</p>
<p>that happens on social media.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a set of harms</p>
<p>that we basically track and build systems to fight against.</p>
<p>And bullying and self harm are,</p>
<p>these are some of the biggest things</p>
<p>that we are most focused on.</p>
<p>For bullying, like you say, it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>while this predates the internet,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably impossible to get rid of all of it.</p>
<p>You wanna give people tools to fight it</p>
<p>and you wanna fight it yourself.</p>
<p>And you also wanna make sure that people have the tools</p>
<p>to get help when they need it.</p>
<p>So I think this isn&rsquo;t like a question of,</p>
<p>can you get rid of all bullying?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, all right, I mean, I have two daughters</p>
<p>and they fight and push each other around and stuff too.</p>
<p>And the question is just,</p>
<p>how do you handle that situation?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a handful of things that I think you can do.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit before around some of the AI tools</p>
<p>that you can build to identify</p>
<p>when something harmful is happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s very hard in bullying</p>
<p>because a lot of bullying is very context specific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re trying to fit a formula of like,</p>
<p>if like looking at the different harms,</p>
<p>someone promoting a terrorist group is like,</p>
<p>probably one of the simpler things to generally find</p>
<p>because things promoting that group are gonna look</p>
<p>at a certain way or feel a certain way.</p>
<p>Bullying could just be, you know,</p>
<p>someone making some subtle comment about someone&rsquo;s appearance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s idiosyncratic to them.</p>
<p>And it could look at just like humor.</p>
<p>So humor to one person can be destructive</p>
<p>to another human being, yeah.</p>
<p>So with bullying, I think there are certain things</p>
<p>that you can find through AI systems,</p>
<p>but I think it is increasingly important</p>
<p>to just give people more agency themselves.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done things like making it</p>
<p>so people can turn off comments</p>
<p>or take a break from hearing from a specific person</p>
<p>without having to signal at all</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna stop following them</p>
<p>or kind of make some stand that,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m not friends with you anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not following you.</p>
<p>I just like, I just don&rsquo;t wanna hear about this,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t wanna signal at all publicly</p>
<p>that or to them that there&rsquo;s been an issue.</p>
<p>And then you get to some of the more extreme cases</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>where someone is thinking about self harm or suicide.</p>
<p>And there we&rsquo;ve found that that is a place</p>
<p>where AI can identify a lot</p>
<p>as well as people flagging things.</p>
<p>If people are expressing something</p>
<p>that is potentially they&rsquo;re thinking of hurting themselves,</p>
<p>those are cues that you can build systems</p>
<p>and hundreds of languages around the world</p>
<p>to be able to identify that.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I&rsquo;m actually quite proud of</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve built these systems</p>
<p>that I think are clearly leading at this point</p>
<p>that not only identify that,</p>
<p>but then connect with local first responders</p>
<p>and have been able to save, I think at this point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in thousands of cases,</p>
<p>be able to get first responders to people</p>
<p>through these systems who really need them</p>
<p>because of specific plumbing that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>between the AI work and being able to communicate</p>
<p>with local first responder organizations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rolling that out in more places around the world.</p>
<p>And I think the team that worked on that</p>
<p>just did awesome stuff.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s a long way of saying,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, this is a heavy topic</p>
<p>and you want to attack it in a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>and also kind of understand that some of nature</p>
<p>is for people to do this to each other,</p>
<p>which is unfortunate,</p>
<p>but you can give people tools and build things that help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still one hell of a burden though.</p>
<p>A platform that allows people</p>
<p>to fall in love with each other</p>
<p>is also by nature going to be a platform</p>
<p>that allows people to hurt each other.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re managing such a platform, it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>And I think you spoke to it,</p>
<p>but the psychology of that, of being a leader in that space,</p>
<p>of creating technology that&rsquo;s playing in this space,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, psychology is really damn difficult.</p>
<p>And I mean, the burden of that is just great.</p>
<p>I just wanted to hear you speak to that point.</p>
<p>I have to ask about the thing you&rsquo;ve brought up a few times,</p>
<p>which is making controversial decisions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about free speech and censorship.</p>
<p>So there are two groups of people pressuring Meta on this.</p>
<p>One group is upset that Facebook, the social network,</p>
<p>allows misinformation in quotes to be spread on the platform.</p>
<p>The other group are concerned that Facebook censors speech</p>
<p>by calling it misinformation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting it from both sides.</p>
<p>You, in 2019, October at Georgetown University,</p>
<p>eloquently defended the importance of free speech,</p>
<p>but then COVID came and the 2020 election came.</p>
<p>Do you worry that outside pressures</p>
<p>from advertisers, politicians, the public,</p>
<p>have forced Meta to damage the ideal of free speech</p>
<p>that you spoke highly of?</p>
<p>Just to say some obvious things upfront,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think pressure from advertisers</p>
<p>or politicians directly in any way</p>
<p>affects how we think about this.</p>
<p>I think these are just hard topics.</p>
<p>So let me just take you through our evolution</p>
<p>from kind of the beginning of the company</p>
<p>to where we are now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t build a company like this</p>
<p>unless you believe that people expressing themselves</p>
<p>is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the foundational thing.</p>
<p>You can kind of think about our company as a formula</p>
<p>where we think giving people voice</p>
<p>and helping people connect creates opportunity, right?</p>
<p>So those are the two things that we&rsquo;re always focused on</p>
<p>are sort of helping people connect.</p>
<p>We talked about that a lot,</p>
<p>but also giving people voice</p>
<p>and ability to express themselves.</p>
<p>Then by the way, most of the time</p>
<p>when people express themselves,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not like politically controversial content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like expressing something about their identity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more related to the avatar conversation</p>
<p>we had earlier in terms of expressing some facet,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to people on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>And sometimes when people feel strongly enough</p>
<p>about something, it kind of becomes a political topic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of always been a thing that we&rsquo;ve focused on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always been the question of safety in this,</p>
<p>which if you&rsquo;re building a community,</p>
<p>I think you have to focus on safety.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had these community standards from early on,</p>
<p>and there are about 20 different kinds of harm</p>
<p>that we track and try to fight actively.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about some of them already.</p>
<p>So it includes things like bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>It includes things like terrorism or promoting terrorism,</p>
<p>inciting violence, intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>And in general, I think call it about 18 out of 20 of those.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not really a particularly polarized definition</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re not really gonna find many people</p>
<p>in the country or in the world</p>
<p>who are trying to say we should be</p>
<p>fighting terrorist content less.</p>
<p>I think the content where there are a couple of areas</p>
<p>where I think that this has gotten more controversial</p>
<p>recently, which I&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, the misinformation is basically is up there.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes the definition of hate speech</p>
<p>is up there too.</p>
<p>But I think in general, most of the content</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re working on for safety</p>
<p>is not actually, people don&rsquo;t kind of have these questions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of this subset.</p>
<p>But if you go back to the beginning of the company,</p>
<p>this was sort of pre deep learning days.</p>
<p>And therefore, it was me and my roommate Dustin join me.</p>
<p>And if someone posted something bad,</p>
<p>it was the AI technology did not exist yet</p>
<p>to be able to go basically look at all the content.</p>
<p>And we were a small enough outfit</p>
<p>that no one would expect that we could review it all.</p>
<p>Even if someone reported it to us,</p>
<p>we basically did our best, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like someone would report it</p>
<p>and we try to look at stuff and deal with stuff.</p>
<p>And for call it the first seven or eight years</p>
<p>of the company, we weren&rsquo;t that big of a company.</p>
<p>For a lot of that period, we weren&rsquo;t even really profitable.</p>
<p>The AI didn&rsquo;t really exist to be able to do</p>
<p>the kind of moderation that we do today.</p>
<p>And then at some point in kind of the middle</p>
<p>of the last decade, that started to flip.</p>
<p>And we got to the point where we were sort of a larger</p>
<p>and more profitable company.</p>
<p>And the AI was starting to come online</p>
<p>to be able to proactively detect</p>
<p>some of the simpler forms of this.</p>
<p>So things like pornography,</p>
<p>you could train an image classifier</p>
<p>to identify what a nipple was,</p>
<p>or you can fight against terrorist content.</p>
<p>You still could.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually papers on this, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Oh, of course there are.</p>
<p>Technical papers.</p>
<p>Of course there are.</p>
<p>Those are relatively easier things to train AI to do</p>
<p>than for example, understand the nuances</p>
<p>of what is inciting violence</p>
<p>in a hundred languages around the world</p>
<p>and not have the false positives of like,</p>
<p>okay, are you posting about this thing</p>
<p>that might be inciting violence</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually trying to denounce it?</p>
<p>In which case we probably shouldn&rsquo;t take that down.</p>
<p>Where if you&rsquo;re trying to denounce something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inciting violence in some kind of dialect</p>
<p>in a corner of India, as opposed to,</p>
<p>okay, actually you&rsquo;re posting this thing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to incite violence.</p>
<p>Okay, building an AI that can basically get</p>
<p>to that level of nuance and all the languages</p>
<p>that we serve is something that I think</p>
<p>is only really becoming possible now,</p>
<p>not towards the middle of the last decade.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s been this evolution,</p>
<p>and I think what happened,</p>
<p>people sort of woke up after 2016</p>
<p>and a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>okay, the country is a lot more polarized</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot more stuff here than we realized.</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t these internet companies on top of this?</p>
<p>And I think at that point it was reasonable feedback</p>
<p>that some of this technology had started becoming possible.</p>
<p>And at that point, I really did feel like</p>
<p>we needed to make a substantially larger investment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d already worked on this stuff a lot,</p>
<p>on AI and on these integrity problems,</p>
<p>but that we should basically invest,</p>
<p>have a thousand or more engineers</p>
<p>basically work on building these AI systems</p>
<p>to be able to go and proactively identify the stuff</p>
<p>across all these different areas.</p>
<p>Okay, so we went and did that.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve built the tools to be able to do that.</p>
<p>And now I think it&rsquo;s actually a much more complicated</p>
<p>set of philosophical rather than technical questions,</p>
<p>which is the exact policies, which are okay.</p>
<p>Now, the way that we basically hold ourselves accountable</p>
<p>is we issue these transparency reports every quarter</p>
<p>and the metric that we track is for each of these</p>
<p>20 types of harmful content.</p>
<p>How much of that content are we taking down</p>
<p>before someone even has to report it to us?</p>
<p>So how effective is our AI at doing this?</p>
<p>But that basically creates this big question,</p>
<p>which is okay, now we need to really be careful</p>
<p>about how proactive we set the AI</p>
<p>and where the exact policy lines are</p>
<p>around what we&rsquo;re taking down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly at a point now where I felt like</p>
<p>at the beginning of that journey</p>
<p>of building those AI systems, there was a lot of push.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s saying, okay, you&rsquo;ve got to do more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly a lot more bad content</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t reporting or that you&rsquo;re not getting to</p>
<p>and you need to get more effective at that.</p>
<p>And I was pretty sympathetic to that.</p>
<p>But then I think at some point along the way,</p>
<p>there started to be almost equal issues on both sides</p>
<p>of, okay, actually you&rsquo;re kind of taking down</p>
<p>too much stuff, right?</p>
<p>Or some of the stuff is borderline</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t really bothering anyone</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t report it.</p>
<p>So is that really an issue that you need to take down?</p>
<p>Whereas we still have the critique on the other side too</p>
<p>where a lot of people think we&rsquo;re not doing enough.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s become, as we built the technical capacity,</p>
<p>I think it becomes more philosophically interesting almost</p>
<p>where you wanna be on the line.</p>
<p>And I just think you don&rsquo;t want one person</p>
<p>making those decisions.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve also tried to innovate</p>
<p>in terms of building out this independent oversight board,</p>
<p>which has people who are dedicated to free expression</p>
<p>but from around the world who people can appeal cases to.</p>
<p>So a lot of the most controversial cases basically go to them</p>
<p>and they make the final binding decision</p>
<p>on how we should handle that.</p>
<p>And then of course, their decisions,</p>
<p>we then try to figure out what the principles are</p>
<p>behind those and encode them into the algorithms.</p>
<p>And how are those people chosen, which, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re outsourcing a difficult decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, the initial people,</p>
<p>we chose a handful of chairs for the group</p>
<p>and we basically chose the people</p>
<p>for a commitment to free expression</p>
<p>and like a broad understanding of human rights</p>
<p>and the trade offs around free expression.</p>
<p>So they fundamentally people</p>
<p>who are gonna lean towards free expression.</p>
<p>Towards freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s also this idea of fact checkers.</p>
<p>So jumping around to the misinformation questions,</p>
<p>especially during COVID,</p>
<p>which is an exceptionally speaking of polarization.</p>
<p>Can I speak to the COVID thing?</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the hardest set of questions</p>
<p>around free expression,</p>
<p>because you asked about Georgetown</p>
<p>has my stance fundamentally changed?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is no, my stance has not changed.</p>
<p>It is fundamentally the same as when I was talking</p>
<p>at Georgetown from a philosophical perspective.</p>
<p>The challenge with free speech is that everyone agrees</p>
<p>that there is a line where if you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>about to do physical harm to people</p>
<p>that there should be restrictions.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s the famous Supreme Court</p>
<p>historical example of like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t yell fire in a crowded theater.</p>
<p>The thing that everyone disagrees on</p>
<p>is what is the definition of real harm?</p>
<p>Where I think some people think,</p>
<p>okay, this should only be a very literal,</p>
<p>I mean, take it back to the bullying conversation</p>
<p>we were just having, where is it just harm</p>
<p>if the person is about to hurt themselves</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been bullied so hard?</p>
<p>Or is it actually harm like as they&rsquo;re being bullied?</p>
<p>And kind of at what point in the spectrum is that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part that there&rsquo;s not agreement on.</p>
<p>But I think what people agree on pretty broadly</p>
<p>is that when there is an acute threat</p>
<p>that it does make sense from a societal perspective</p>
<p>to tolerate less speech.</p>
<p>That could be potentially harmful in that acute situation.</p>
<p>So I think where COVID got very difficult is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone expected this to be going on for years.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;d kind of asked now a priori,</p>
<p>would a global pandemic where a lot of people are dying</p>
<p>and catching this, is that an emergency</p>
<p>that where you&rsquo;d kind of consider it</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s problematic to basically yell fire</p>
<p>in a crowded theater?</p>
<p>I think that that probably passes that test.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s a very tricky situation,</p>
<p>but I think the fundamental commitment</p>
<p>to free expression is there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t think you start this company</p>
<p>unless you care about people being able</p>
<p>to express themselves as much as possible.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;s the question,</p>
<p>is how do you define what the harm is</p>
<p>and how acute that is?</p>
<p>And what are the institutions that define that harm?</p>
<p>A lot of the criticism is that the CDC, the WHO,</p>
<p>the institutions we&rsquo;ve come to trust as a civilization</p>
<p>to give the line of what is and isn&rsquo;t harm</p>
<p>in terms of health policy have failed in many ways,</p>
<p>in small ways and in big ways, depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>And then the perspective of meta and Facebook is like,</p>
<p>well, where the hell do I get the information</p>
<p>of what is and isn&rsquo;t misinformation?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really difficult place to be in,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s great to hear that you&rsquo;re leaning</p>
<p>towards freedom of speech on this aspect.</p>
<p>And again, I think this actually calls to the fact</p>
<p>that we need to reform institutions</p>
<p>that help keep an open mind</p>
<p>of what is and isn&rsquo;t misinformation.</p>
<p>And misinformation has been used to bully on the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, I just have, I&rsquo;m friends with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and he is called as a,</p>
<p>I remember hanging out with him in Vegas</p>
<p>and somebody yelled, stop spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>I mean, and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that follow him</p>
<p>that believe he&rsquo;s not spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just not acknowledge the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that have a different definition of misinformation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such a tough place to be.</p>
<p>Like who do you listen to?</p>
<p>Do you listen to quote unquote experts who gets,</p>
<p>as a person who has a PhD, I gotta say,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure I know what defines an expert,</p>
<p>especially in a new,</p>
<p>in a totally new pandemic or a new catastrophic event,</p>
<p>especially when politics is involved</p>
<p>and especially when the news are,</p>
<p>the media involved that can propagate</p>
<p>sort of outrageous narratives</p>
<p>and thereby make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Like what the hell?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the source of truth?</p>
<p>And then everybody turns to Facebook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, please tell me what the source of truth is.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, well, how would you handle this</p>
<p>if you were in my position?</p>
<p>Is very, very, very, very difficult.</p>
<p>I would say,</p>
<p>I would more speak about how difficult the choices are</p>
<p>and be transparent about like,</p>
<p>what the hell do you do with this?</p>
<p>Like here, you got exactly,</p>
<p>ask the exact question you just asked me,</p>
<p>but to the broader public, like, okay, yeah,</p>
<p>you guys tell me what to do.</p>
<p>So like crowdsource it.</p>
<p>And then the other aspect is when you spoke really eloquently</p>
<p>about the fact that there&rsquo;s this going back and forth</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s a feeling like you&rsquo;re censoring</p>
<p>a little bit too much.</p>
<p>So I would lean, I would try to be ahead of that feeling.</p>
<p>I would now lean towards freedom of speech and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not the ones that are going to define misinformation.</p>
<p>Let it be a public debate, let the idea stand.</p>
<p>And I actually place, this idea of misinformation,</p>
<p>I place the responsibility</p>
<p>on the poor communication skills of scientists.</p>
<p>They should be in the battlefield of ideas</p>
<p>and everybody who is spreading information</p>
<p>against the vaccine, they should not be censored.</p>
<p>They should be talked with and you should show the data,</p>
<p>you should have open discussion</p>
<p>as opposed to rolling your eyes and saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the expert, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>No, you need to convince people, it&rsquo;s a battle of ideas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the whole point of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way to defeat bad ideas</p>
<p>is with good ideas, with speech.</p>
<p>So like the responsibility here falls</p>
<p>on the poor communication skills of scientists.</p>
<p>Thanks to social media, scientists are not communicators.</p>
<p>They have the power to communicate.</p>
<p>Some of the best stuff I&rsquo;ve seen about COVID</p>
<p>from doctors is on social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to learn to respond really quickly,</p>
<p>to go faster than the peer review process.</p>
<p>And so they just need to get way better</p>
<p>at that communication.</p>
<p>And also by better, I don&rsquo;t mean just convincing,</p>
<p>I also mean speak with humility,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk down to people, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And as a platform, I would say,</p>
<p>I would step back a little bit.</p>
<p>Not all the way, of course,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that can cause real harm</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>but you lean more towards freedom of speech</p>
<p>because then people from a brand perspective</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be blaming you for the other ills of society,</p>
<p>which there are many.</p>
<p>The institutions have flaws, the political divide,</p>
<p>obviously politicians have flaws, that&rsquo;s news.</p>
<p>The media has flaws that they&rsquo;re all trying to work with.</p>
<p>And because of the central place of Facebook in the world,</p>
<p>all of those flaws somehow kind of propagate to Facebook.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sitting there as Plato, the philosopher,</p>
<p>have to answer to some of the most difficult questions</p>
<p>asking, being asked of human civilization.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, maybe this is an American answer though,</p>
<p>to lean towards freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that applies globally.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But transparency and saying, I think as a technologist,</p>
<p>one of the things I sense about Facebook and meta</p>
<p>when people talk about this company</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t necessarily understand</p>
<p>fully how difficult the problem is.</p>
<p>You talked about AI has to catch</p>
<p>a bunch of harmful stuff really quickly.</p>
<p>Just the sea of data you have to deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really difficult problem.</p>
<p>So like any of the critics,</p>
<p>if you just hand them the helm for a week,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how well you can do.</p>
<p>Like that, to me, that&rsquo;s definitely something</p>
<p>that would wake people up to how difficult this problem is</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s more transparency</p>
<p>of saying how difficult this problem is.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about, on the AI front,</p>
<p>just because you mentioned language and my ineloquence.</p>
<p>Translation is something I wanted to ask you about.</p>
<p>And first, just to give a shout out to the supercomputer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve recently announced the AI research supercluster, RSC.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m somebody who loves the GPUs.</p>
<p>It currently has 6,000 GPUs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DGX A100 is the systems that have</p>
<p>in total 6,000 GPUs.</p>
<p>And it will eventually, maybe this year,</p>
<p>maybe soon, will have 16,000 GPUs.</p>
<p>So it can do a bunch of different kinds</p>
<p>of machine learning applications.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cool thing on the distributed storage aspect</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So one of the applications that I think is super exciting</p>
<p>is translation, real time translation.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you that having a conversation,</p>
<p>I speak Russian fluently,</p>
<p>I speak English somewhat fluently,</p>
<p>and having a conversation with Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>say, as a use case.</p>
<p>Me, as a user, coming to you as a use case.</p>
<p>We both speak each other&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>I speak Russian, he speaks English.</p>
<p>How can we have that communication go well</p>
<p>with the help of AI?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s such a beautiful and a powerful application</p>
<p>of AI to connect the world,</p>
<p>that bridge the gap, not necessarily between me and Putin,</p>
<p>but people that don&rsquo;t have that shared language.</p>
<p>Can you just speak about your vision with translation?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s a really exciting application.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to help people connect</p>
<p>all around the world,</p>
<p>a lot of content is produced in one language</p>
<p>and people in all these other places are interested in it.</p>
<p>So being able to translate that</p>
<p>just unlocks a lot of value on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>I mean, so the kind of AI around translation is interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gone through a bunch of iterations.</p>
<p>But the basic state of the art</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t wanna go through</p>
<p>different kind of intermediate symbolic</p>
<p>representations of language or something like that.</p>
<p>You basically wanna be able to map the concepts</p>
<p>and basically go directly from one language to another.</p>
<p>And you just can train bigger and bigger models</p>
<p>in order to be able to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the research supercluster comes in</p>
<p>is basically a lot of the trend in machine learning</p>
<p>is just you&rsquo;re building bigger and bigger models</p>
<p>and you just need a lot of computation to train them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that like the translation would run</p>
<p>on the supercomputer, the training of the model,</p>
<p>which could have billions or trillions of examples</p>
<p>of just basically that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re training models on this supercluster</p>
<p>in days or weeks that might take a much longer period of time</p>
<p>on a smaller cluster.</p>
<p>So it just wouldn&rsquo;t be practical for most teams to do.</p>
<p>But the translation work,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically getting from being able to go</p>
<p>between about a hundred languages seamlessly today</p>
<p>to being able to go to about 300 languages in the near term.</p>
<p>So from any language to any other language.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And part of the issue when you get closer to more languages</p>
<p>is some of these get to be pretty,</p>
<p>not very popular languages, right?</p>
<p>Where there isn&rsquo;t that much content in them.</p>
<p>So you end up having less data</p>
<p>and you need to kind of use a model that you&rsquo;ve built up</p>
<p>around other examples.</p>
<p>And this is one of the big questions around AI</p>
<p>is like how generalizable can things be?</p>
<p>And that I think is one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of exciting here</p>
<p>from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>But capturing, we talked about this with the metaverse,</p>
<p>capturing the magic of human to human interaction.</p>
<p>So me and Putin, okay.</p>
<p>Again, this is therapy session.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a tough example</p>
<p>because you actually both speak Russian and English.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But in the future.</p>
<p>I see it as a touring test of a kind</p>
<p>because we would both like to have an AI that improves</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t speak Russian that well.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t speak English that well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would be nice to outperform our abilities</p>
<p>and it sets a really nice bar</p>
<p>because I think AI can really help in translation</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t speak the language at all,</p>
<p>but to actually capture the magic of the chemistry,</p>
<p>the translation, which would make the metaverse</p>
<p>super immersive.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>You remove the barrier of language, period.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when people think about translation,</p>
<p>I think a lot of that is they&rsquo;re thinking about text to text,</p>
<p>but speech to speech, I think is a whole nother thing.</p>
<p>And I mean, one of the big lessons on that,</p>
<p>which I was referring to before is I think early models,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, all right, they take speech,</p>
<p>they translate it to text,</p>
<p>translate the text to another language</p>
<p>and then kind of output that as speech in that language.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>You just wanna be able to go directly from speech</p>
<p>in one language to speech in another language</p>
<p>and build up the models to do that.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think one of the,</p>
<p>there have been,</p>
<p>when you look at the progress in machine learning,</p>
<p>there have been big advances in the techniques,</p>
<p>some of the advances in self supervised learning,</p>
<p>which I know you talked to Jan about</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like one of the leading thinkers in this area.</p>
<p>I just think that that stuff is really exciting,</p>
<p>but then you couple that with the ability</p>
<p>to just throw larger and larger amounts of compute</p>
<p>at training these models.</p>
<p>And you can just do a lot of things</p>
<p>that were harder to do before.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re asking more of our systems too, right?</p>
<p>So if you think about the applications</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna need for the metaverse,</p>
<p>or think about it, okay,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s talk about AR here for a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have these glasses,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna look hopefully</p>
<p>like a normal ish looking pair of glasses,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna be able to put holograms in the world</p>
<p>and intermix virtual and physical objects in your scene.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s gonna be unique about this</p>
<p>compared to every other computing device</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve had before,</p>
<p>is that this is gonna be the first computing device</p>
<p>that has all the same signals</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on around you that you have.</p>
<p>Right, so your phone,</p>
<p>you can have it take a photo or a video,</p>
<p>but I mean, these glasses are gonna,</p>
<p>whenever you activate them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be able to see what you see</p>
<p>from your perspective,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be able to hear what you hear</p>
<p>because the microphones and all that</p>
<p>are gonna be right around where your ears are.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna want an AI assistant,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a new kind of AI assistant</p>
<p>that can basically help you process the world</p>
<p>from this first person perspective</p>
<p>or from the perspective that you have.</p>
<p>And the utility of that is gonna be huge,</p>
<p>but the kinds of AI models that we&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>are going to be just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a lot that we&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>to basically make advances in.</p>
<p>But I mean, but that&rsquo;s why I think these concepts</p>
<p>of the metaverse and the advances in AI</p>
<p>are so fundamentally interlinked</p>
<p>that I mean, they&rsquo;re kind of enabling each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, like the world builder is a really cool idea.</p>
<p>Like you can be like a Bob Ross,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna put a little tree right here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I need a little tree, it&rsquo;s missing a little tree.</p>
<p>And then, but at scale,</p>
<p>like enriching your experience in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>You mentioned the assistant too,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting how you can have AI assistants</p>
<p>helping you out on different levels</p>
<p>of sort of intimacy of communication.</p>
<p>It could be just like scheduling</p>
<p>or it could be like almost like therapy.</p>
<p>Clearly I need some.</p>
<p>So let me ask you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the most successful people ever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve built an incredible company</p>
<p>that has a lot of impact.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for young people today?</p>
<p>How to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>How to build something that can have a big positive impact</p>
<p>on the world?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s break that down.</p>
<p>Cause I think you proud of, have a big positive impact.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re actually listening.</p>
<p>And how to live your life</p>
<p>are actually three different things that I think,</p>
<p>I mean, they could line up,</p>
<p>but, and also like what age of people are you talking to?</p>
<p>Cause I mean, I can like.</p>
<p>High school and college.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but your dream big.</p>
<p>And you really have a chance to do something unprecedented.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess just to.</p>
<p>Also for people my age.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s maybe start with the kind of most</p>
<p>philosophical and abstract version of this.</p>
<p>Every night when I put my daughters to bed,</p>
<p>we go through this thing and like,</p>
<p>they call it the good night things.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re basically what we talk about at night.</p>
<p>And I just, I go through them.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good show.</p>
<p>The good night things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Priscilla&rsquo;s always asking, she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can I get good night things?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You go to bed too early.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I basically go through with Max and Augie,</p>
<p>what are the things that are most important in life?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That I just, it&rsquo;s like, what do I want them to remember</p>
<p>and just have like really ingrained in them as they grow up?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s health, right?</p>
<p>Making sure that you take care of yourself</p>
<p>and keep yourself in good shape,</p>
<p>loving friends and family, right?</p>
<p>Because having the relationships,</p>
<p>the family and making time for friends,</p>
<p>I think is perhaps one of the most important things.</p>
<p>And then the third is maybe a little more amorphous,</p>
<p>but it is something that you&rsquo;re excited about for the future.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m talking to a four year old,</p>
<p>often I&rsquo;ll ask her what she&rsquo;s excited about</p>
<p>for tomorrow or the week ahead.</p>
<p>But I think for most people, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I mean, the world is a heavy place.</p>
<p>And I think like the way that we navigate it</p>
<p>is that we have things that we&rsquo;re looking forward to.</p>
<p>So whether it is building AR glasses for the future</p>
<p>or being able to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary</p>
<p>with my wife that&rsquo;s coming up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I think people,</p>
<p>you know, you have things that you&rsquo;re looking forward to.</p>
<p>Or for the girls, it&rsquo;s often I want to see mom</p>
<p>in the morning, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, but it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s a really critical thing.</p>
<p>And then the last thing is I ask them every day,</p>
<p>what did you do today to help someone?</p>
<p>Because I just think that that&rsquo;s a really critical thing</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s easy to kind of get caught up in yourself</p>
<p>and kind of stuff that&rsquo;s really far down the road,</p>
<p>but like, did you do something just concrete today</p>
<p>to help someone?</p>
<p>And, you know, it can just be as simple as, okay, yeah,</p>
<p>I helped set the table for lunch, right?</p>
<p>Or, you know, this other kid in our school</p>
<p>was having a hard time with something</p>
<p>and I like helped explain it to him.</p>
<p>But in that those are, that&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>if you were to boil down my overall life philosophy</p>
<p>into what I try to impart to my kids,</p>
<p>those are the things that I think are really important.</p>
<p>So, okay, so let&rsquo;s say college.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a graduate in college,</p>
<p>probably more practical advice, I&rsquo;m always very focused</p>
<p>on people.</p>
<p>And I think the most important decision</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna make if you&rsquo;re in college</p>
<p>is who you surround yourself with,</p>
<p>because you become like the people</p>
<p>you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>And I sort of have this hiring heuristic at Metta,</p>
<p>which is that I will only hire someone to work for me</p>
<p>if I could see myself working for them.</p>
<p>Not necessarily that I want them to run the company</p>
<p>because I like my job, but in an alternate universe,</p>
<p>if it was their company and I was looking</p>
<p>to go work somewhere, would I be happy to work for them?</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a helpful heuristic</p>
<p>to help balance, you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re building something like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure to, you know,</p>
<p>you wanna build out your team,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that you need to get done.</p>
<p>And everyone always says, don&rsquo;t compromise on quality,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this question of, okay,</p>
<p>well, how do you know that someone is good enough?</p>
<p>And I think my answer is, I would want someone</p>
<p>to be on my team if I would work for them.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s actually a pretty similar answer</p>
<p>to like, if you were choosing friends or a partner</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re kind of in college,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what your circle is gonna be,</p>
<p>trying to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re evaluating data,</p>
<p>your circle is gonna be trying to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re evaluating different job opportunities.</p>
<p>Who are the people, even if they&rsquo;re gonna be peers</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>who are the people who in an alternate university,</p>
<p>you would wanna work for them,</p>
<p>because you think you&rsquo;re gonna learn a lot from them,</p>
<p>because they know, because they are kind of values aligned</p>
<p>on the things that you care about,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna like, and they&rsquo;re gonna push you,</p>
<p>but also they know different things</p>
<p>and have different experiences</p>
<p>that are kind of more of what you wanna become like</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, I think probably people are too,</p>
<p>in general, objective focused,</p>
<p>and maybe not focused enough on the connections</p>
<p>and the people who they&rsquo;re basically building relationships</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it says about me,</p>
<p>but my place in Austin now has seven legged robots.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m surrounded myself by robots,</p>
<p>which is probably something I should look into.</p>
<p>What kind of world would you like to see your daughters</p>
<p>grow up in, even after you&rsquo;re gone?</p>
<p>Well, I think one of the promises of all the stuff</p>
<p>that is getting built now is that it can be a world</p>
<p>where more people can just live out their imagination.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes,</p>
<p>I think it was attributed to Picasso,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that all children are artists,</p>
<p>and the challenge is how do you remain one</p>
<p>when you grow up?</p>
<p>And if you have kids, this is pretty clear,</p>
<p>I mean, they just have wonderful imaginations.</p>
<p>And part of what I think is gonna be great</p>
<p>about the creator economy and the metaverse</p>
<p>and all this stuff is this notion around</p>
<p>that a lot more people in the future</p>
<p>are gonna get to work doing creative stuff</p>
<p>than what I think today we would just consider</p>
<p>traditional labor or service.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of what people are here to do</p>
<p>is collaborate together, work together,</p>
<p>think of things that you wanna build and go do it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, one of the things</p>
<p>that I just think is striking,</p>
<p>so I teach my daughters some basic coding with Scratch.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re still obviously really young,</p>
<p>but I think of coding as building,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like when I&rsquo;m coding,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building something that I want to exist.</p>
<p>But my youngest daughter, she&rsquo;s very musical</p>
<p>and pretty artistic and she thinks about coding as art.</p>
<p>She calls it code art, not the code,</p>
<p>but the output of what she is making.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s just very interesting visually</p>
<p>in what she can kind of output and how it can move around.</p>
<p>And do we need to fix that?</p>
<p>Are we good?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Do we have to clap, Alexa?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was just talking about Augie and her code art,</p>
<p>but I mean, to me, this is like a beautiful thing, right?</p>
<p>The notion that like for me,</p>
<p>coding was this functional thing and I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>And it like helped build something utilitarian,</p>
<p>but that for the next generation of people,</p>
<p>it will be even more an expression</p>
<p>of their kind of imagination and artistic sense</p>
<p>for what they want to exist.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that happens,</p>
<p>if we can help bring about this world</p>
<p>where a lot more people can,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s like their existence going forward</p>
<p>is being able to basically create</p>
<p>and live out all these different kinds of art.</p>
<p>I just think that that&rsquo;s like a beautiful</p>
<p>and wonderful thing and will be very freeing for humanity</p>
<p>to spend more of our time on the things that matter to us.</p>
<p>Yeah, allow more and more people to express their art</p>
<p>in the full meaning of that word.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful vision.</p>
<p>We mentioned that you are mortal.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>And are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t sign up for this on a podcast, did you?</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m definitely aware of it.</p>
<p>I do a fair amount of like extreme sport type stuff.</p>
<p>So like, so I&rsquo;m definitely aware of it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re flirting with it a bit.</p>
<p>I train hard.</p>
<p>I mean, so it&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m gonna go out</p>
<p>in like a 15 foot wave.</p>
<p>Go out big.</p>
<p>Well, then it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure we have the right safety gear</p>
<p>and like make sure that I&rsquo;m like used to that spot</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But like, but you know, I mean, you.</p>
<p>The risk is still there.</p>
<p>You take some head blows along the way.</p>
<p>Yes, but definitely aware of it.</p>
<p>Definitely would like to stay safe.</p>
<p>I have a lot of stuff that I want to build and want to.</p>
<p>Does it freak you out that it&rsquo;s finite though?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a deadline when it&rsquo;s all over</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;ll be a time when your daughters are around</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gone?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t freak me out.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Constraints are helpful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the finiteness makes ice cream</p>
<p>taste more delicious somehow.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that with the metaverse too.</p>
<p>You want, we talked about this identity earlier,</p>
<p>like having just one, like NFTs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something powerful about the constraint</p>
<p>of finiteness or uniqueness.</p>
<p>That this moment is singular in history.</p>
<p>But I mean, a lot of,</p>
<p>as you go through different waves of technology,</p>
<p>I think a lot of what is interesting is</p>
<p>what becomes in practice infinite</p>
<p>or kind of there can be many, many of a thing</p>
<p>and then what ends up still being constrained.</p>
<p>So the metaverse should hopefully allow</p>
<p>a very large number or maybe in practice,</p>
<p>hopefully close to an infinite amount of expression</p>
<p>and worlds, but we&rsquo;ll still only have</p>
<p>a finite amount of time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think living longer I think is good.</p>
<p>And obviously all of my, our philanthropic work is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not focused on longevity,</p>
<p>but it is focused on trying to achieve</p>
<p>what I think is a possible goal in this century,</p>
<p>which is to be able to cure, prevent</p>
<p>or manage all diseases.</p>
<p>So I certainly think people kind of getting sick</p>
<p>and dying is a bad thing because,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m dedicating almost all of my capital</p>
<p>towards advancing research in that area to push on that,</p>
<p>which I mean, we could do a whole,</p>
<p>another one of these podcasts about that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a fascinating topic.</p>
<p>I mean, this is with your wife Priscilla Chan,</p>
<p>you formed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,</p>
<p>gave away 99% or pledged to give away 99%</p>
<p>of Facebook non meta shares.</p>
<p>I mean, like you said, we could talk forever</p>
<p>about all the exciting things you&rsquo;re working on there,</p>
<p>including the sort of moonshot of eradicating disease</p>
<p>by the mid century marker.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know if you&rsquo;re gonna ever eradicate it,</p>
<p>but I think you can get to a point where you</p>
<p>can either cure things that happened, right?</p>
<p>So people get diseases, but you can cure them.</p>
<p>Prevent is probably closest to eradication</p>
<p>or just be able to manage as sort of like ongoing things</p>
<p>that are not gonna ruin your life.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think saying that there&rsquo;s gonna be no disease at all</p>
<p>probably is not possible within the next several decades.</p>
<p>Basic thing is increase the quality of life</p>
<p>and maybe keep the finiteness</p>
<p>because it makes everything taste more delicious.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just being a romantic 20th century human.</p>
<p>Maybe, but I mean, but it was an intentional decision</p>
<p>to not focus on our philanthropy on like explicitly</p>
<p>on longevity or living forever.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If at the moment of your death, and by the way,</p>
<p>I like that the lights went out</p>
<p>when we started talking about death.</p>
<p>You get to meet God.</p>
<p>It does make it a lot more dramatic.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>I should get closer to the mic.</p>
<p>At the moment of your death, you get to meet God</p>
<p>and you get to ask one question.</p>
<p>What question would you like to ask?</p>
<p>Or maybe a whole conversation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more dramatic when it&rsquo;s just one question.</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s only one question and I died,</p>
<p>I would just wanna know that Priscilla and my family,</p>
<p>like if they were gonna be okay.</p>
<p>That might depend on the circumstances of my death.</p>
<p>But I think that in most circumstances that I can think of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the main thing that I would care about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think God will hear that question and be like,</p>
<p>all right, fine, you get in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the right question to ask.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The humility and selfishness.</p>
<p>All right, you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I mean, but well, maybe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be fine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Okay, but I mean, one of the things that I think</p>
<p>I struggle with at least is on the one hand,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the thing that&rsquo;s closest to me</p>
<p>and maybe the most common human experience.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, one of the things that I just struggle with</p>
<p>in terms of running this large enterprise is like,</p>
<p>should the thing that I care more about</p>
<p>be that responsibility?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s shifted over time.</p>
<p>I mean, like before I really had a family</p>
<p>that was like the only thing I cared about.</p>
<p>And at this point, I mean, I care deeply about it,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think that that&rsquo;s not as obvious of a question.</p>
<p>Yeah, we humans are weird.</p>
<p>You get this ability to impact millions of lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s definitely something, billions of lives,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something you care about,</p>
<p>but the weird humans that are closest to us,</p>
<p>those are the ones that mean the most.</p>
<p>And I suppose that&rsquo;s the dream of the metaverse</p>
<p>is to connect, form small groups like that</p>
<p>where you can have those intimate relationships.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the big, ridiculous.</p>
<p>Well, and to be able to be close,</p>
<p>not just based on who you happen to be next to.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what the internet is already doing</p>
<p>is allowing you to spend more of your time</p>
<p>not physically proximate.</p>
<p>I mean, I always think when you think about the metaverse,</p>
<p>people ask this question about the real world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the virtual world versus the real world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, the real world is a combination</p>
<p>of the virtual world and the physical world.</p>
<p>But I think over time, as we get more technology,</p>
<p>the physical world is becoming less of a percent</p>
<p>of the real world.</p>
<p>And I think that that opens up a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>for people, because you can work in different places.</p>
<p>You can stay more close to, stay closer to people</p>
<p>who are in different places.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Removing barriers of geography</p>
<p>and then barriers of language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful vision.</p>
<p>Big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I think that, well, there are probably a couple</p>
<p>of different ways that I would go at this.</p>
<p>But I think it gets back to this last question</p>
<p>that we talked about, about the duality</p>
<p>between you have the people around you</p>
<p>who you care the most about,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s like this bigger thing</p>
<p>that maybe you&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>And I think that in my own life, I mean,</p>
<p>I sort of think about this tension,</p>
<p>but I mean, it&rsquo;s like, I started this whole company</p>
<p>and my life&rsquo;s work is around human connection.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s intellectually probably the thing</p>
<p>that I go to first is just that human connection</p>
<p>is the meaning.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think that it&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>that our society probably systematically undervalues.</p>
<p>I mean, I just remember when I was growing up</p>
<p>and in school, it&rsquo;s like, do your homework</p>
<p>and then go play with your friends after.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, well, what if playing</p>
<p>with your friends is the point?</p>
<p>That sounds like an argument your daughter would make.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, I just think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Homework doesn&rsquo;t even matter, man.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and people, I think people tend to think</p>
<p>about that stuff as wasting time,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s like what you do in the free time that you have.</p>
<p>But like, what if that&rsquo;s actually the point?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s maybe a different way of counting out this,</p>
<p>which is maybe more like religious in nature.</p>
<p>I mean, I always like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a rabbi who I&rsquo;ve studied with</p>
<p>who kind of gave me this,</p>
<p>we were talking through Genesis and the Bible and the Torah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically walking through,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, you go through the seven days of creation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why does the Bible start there?</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s like it could have started anywhere,</p>
<p>right, in terms of like how to live.</p>
<p>But basically it starts with talking about</p>
<p>how God created people in his, her image.</p>
<p>But the Bible starts by talking about</p>
<p>how God created everything.</p>
<p>So I actually think that there&rsquo;s like a compelling argument</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;ve always just found meaningful</p>
<p>and inspiring that a lot of the point</p>
<p>of what sort of religion has been telling us</p>
<p>that we should do is to create and build things.</p>
<p>So these things are not necessarily at odds.</p>
<p>I mean, I think like, I mean, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and I think probably to some degree</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d expect me to say something like this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve dedicated my life to creating things</p>
<p>that help people connect.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s sort of the fusion of,</p>
<p>I mean, getting back to what we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I mean, what I studied in school</p>
<p>or psychology and computer science, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I mean, these are like the two themes</p>
<p>that I care about, but I don&rsquo;t know for me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what I think about, that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>To create and to love, which is the ultimate form</p>
<p>of connection.</p>
<p>I think this is one hell of an amazing replay experience</p>
<p>in the metaverse.</p>
<p>So whoever is using our avatars years from now,</p>
<p>I hope you had fun and thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with the end of the poem, If,</p>
<p>by Roger Kipling.</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
<p>or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch,</p>
<p>if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
<p>if all men count with you, but none too much.</p>
<p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
<p>with 60 seconds worth of distance run,</p>
<p>yours is the earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>And which is more, you&rsquo;ll be a man, my son.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
