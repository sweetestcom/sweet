    <p>All right, his monthly burn rate would make even Bezos wins. He&rsquo;s living the life of a Sri Lankan</p>
<p>prince. He drinks nothing but the absolute highest top shelf. He&rsquo;s lifting Italy&rsquo;s GDP</p>
<p>by himself. The dictator&rsquo;s back to mouth Polly. I&rsquo;m back to the program.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jake. When you mentioned that burn rate, I thought you could be talking about me.</p>
<p>Sometimes these intros, you&rsquo;re not sure which which way it&rsquo;s a misdirect. It&rsquo;s a misdirect</p>
<p>comedy. It is inconceivable that my burn is higher than David&rsquo;s. I have I own one house.</p>
<p>How is it possible? And maybe one or two next.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s analyzing macroeconomic charts and grids while at the same time ignoring his kids. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the sultan of SAS. It&rsquo;s no surprise. The only thing heavier than his pockets, the bags under</p>
<p>his eyes. The rain man is back. David Sacks. It&rsquo;s not bad. Oh, here we go. Here we go.</p>
<p>The admiral of anxiety. He&rsquo;s rife with strife. He plays on his PS five and he also plays one</p>
<p>in real life. Meow. The commander of the Catboys, David Friedberg. I mean, I&rsquo;m totally cool with</p>
<p>that opening because you&rsquo;re going to look like an asshole. It&rsquo;s all good. I mean, more of an</p>
<p>asshole. I mean, you didn&rsquo;t ignore it. Every time Friedberg spoke, you would have heard</p>
<p>that the guy from unimportant pictures reached out to him, gave him a link to download a free</p>
<p>game about cats, which he downloaded and he&rsquo;s been playing. It&rsquo;s now the most popular video</p>
<p>game in the world. You introduced the cat game. It&rsquo;s on you. By the way, what shirt are you</p>
<p>wearing? It looks like a carpet. Yeah, you really do look like one of the characters from Goodfellas.</p>
<p>Like one of the older guys in the Kansas City. Oh, yeah, I have my cigars right off screen here.</p>
<p>And I got my coffee. I got from Duncan. You remind me one of the guys in Kansas City from</p>
<p>casino. Absolutely. I sit around the table in that restaurant. It&rsquo;s like, should we whack him?</p>
<p>Why take a chance? Boom. You get him. I got my style icons. Joe Pesci&rsquo;s my style icon.</p>
<p>You look really bad. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>GDP fell by point 9% in q2 marking two straight quarters of negative growth.</p>
<p>In q1, we all know GDP fell 1.6%. Here&rsquo;s the real GDP chart. Current dollar GDP increased 7.8%</p>
<p>an annual rate or 465 billion in q2 to a level of 24.85 trillion home construction down 14%</p>
<p>ostensibly because of the interest rates increasing inventories which helped boost</p>
<p>GDP in 2121 drag down growth in q2. So supply chains easing, taking away two percentage points.</p>
<p>Chamath, what&rsquo;s your take? Do these year over year comparisons work? We were talking in the</p>
<p>chat a little bit about the spike in 2021 versus the dip in 2020. What&rsquo;s your take on this?</p>
<p>I think you just summarized it. People are really fixated on these numbers without understanding</p>
<p>basic statistics. So just taking a step back, if you go to the Bureau of Economic Analysis,</p>
<p>which is an official website of the government of the United States that hosts GDP, the title</p>
<p>makes it pretty self-obvious what we&rsquo;re dealing with here, which it says, Nick, you can put it</p>
<p>up there. Real GDP, the percent change from the preceding quarter. So things can still go</p>
<p>up positively, but still be negative if it doesn&rsquo;t go up by the same or more than the quarter before</p>
<p>it. The thing that we really have going on is that over the last eight quarters, we&rsquo;ve had all</p>
<p>kinds of very turbulent data that&rsquo;s made the trend line unpredictable. And the most obvious way to</p>
<p>see this is actually in one specific subsector, which we&rsquo;ll get to in a second, which is around</p>
<p>US e-commerce adoption. You see this one huge spike coming out of nowhere. And then eventually,</p>
<p>everything has settled back to trend. The same way, I think what we&rsquo;re waiting to figure out</p>
<p>is how many quarters does it take for us to get back to on-trend growth in the economy?</p>
<p>We had a massive shortfall in Q2 of 2020. We had a massive surplus in Q3 of 2020. We&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>country that&rsquo;s been getting back to finding equilibrium over the last five quarters. So we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know what the steady state growth should be. This is why I specifically had such</p>
<p>an issue with the tone the White House took, which was trying to explain away that this isn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>recession by trying to create doubt in the definition. Instead, I think it would have been</p>
<p>much better off just repeating what I just said and explaining basic statistics and actually</p>
<p>showing that the country is headed in the right direction, largely speaking from a really crazy</p>
<p>one-time externality that nobody could have predicted, that it&rsquo;s going to take some number</p>
<p>of quarters. And so really what you should look at, and Jason, you&rsquo;ve pointed to this,</p>
<p>is employment and wages and try to be a little bit more circumspect in overreacting to any one</p>
<p>quarter of data. By the way, the Fed exactly just said the same thing yesterday when they raised 75</p>
<p>basis points. They said, we are not going to give guidance anymore because things are too turbulent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to remain vigilant on inflation, but mostly we&rsquo;re going to be very</p>
<p>near-term data dependent. So I would boil all of this in saying, let&rsquo;s not overreact to a quarter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>print here or there, and specifically the label. I think the White House made a mistake in trying</p>
<p>to basically think we all didn&rsquo;t understand what a technical recession was. I think instead,</p>
<p>we should just focus on what we have to do to get back to solid state equilibrium.</p>
<p>Yeah. And just to put a pin in the definitions, we all know the common definition,</p>
<p>two successive quarters of negative GDP. However, people have said it&rsquo;s a temporary</p>
<p>economic decline during which trade and industry activity are reduced. So there&rsquo;s a sort of debate</p>
<p>and splitting hairs going on, Sax, which was kind of stupid. The big news this morning is that we no</p>
<p>longer know what a recession is. This is such a vast and complicated question. You might as well</p>
<p>be asking, what is the meaning of life? Now, I remember in the days of Republican presidents,</p>
<p>we had a very simple definition of recession, which was two quarters of negative GDP growth.</p>
<p>But now that we have a Democrat in the White House, we just can&rsquo;t know these things. Why even</p>
<p>ask such difficult questions, right? I mean, that&rsquo;s basically the media coverage today,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s absurd. I mean, and you saw for the last week, the administration and its spokespeople</p>
<p>have been trying to muddy the waters on the definition of recession. And it was laughable</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re doing it. But now you see the media coverage today, and you realize like they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>bought into this nonsense, and they&rsquo;re carrying so much water for the administration. Look,</p>
<p>the headline should be the Biden recession has begun. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If you had three minutes and 45 seconds for your Biden over under with sacks,</p>
<p>you took the under you won.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a recession. He&rsquo;s the president. And if we had a Republican in the White House,</p>
<p>it would be Republican president recession has begun. Yeah. So the media here is carrying so</p>
<p>much water to try to avoid the obvious headline. I just explained it. Instead of reporting the</p>
<p>obvious headline, they&rsquo;re now saying that we&rsquo;re approaching a recession, or we might be in</p>
<p>recession. We have all these difficult technical issues. Listen, we&rsquo;re in a recession. It started,</p>
<p>it might be a shallow recession. We don&rsquo;t know yet. Yeah. It&rsquo;s a recession in which the unemployment</p>
<p>rate as of today is low, although the labor participation rates also low. So listen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the beginning of a recession, it might turn out we might have a bouncing Q3,</p>
<p>this might be more of a double dip, I suspect that&rsquo;s what it will be. But we know the cause</p>
<p>of this. The cause of this recession is inflation. If you look at the economy&rsquo;s growth on in nominal</p>
<p>terms, it grew at seven point something percent, but because inflation was at 9%, you have to</p>
<p>subtract them in real terms, the economy is shrinking. And who is to blame for reset for</p>
<p>inflation? Well, Jay Powell, the Fed, because he reacted way too slowly, but also the Biden</p>
<p>administration for all the spending they did. How much sooner do you think they could have reacted</p>
<p>two quarters? No, like nine months earlier. So three, we got that we got that first surprise</p>
<p>inflation print last summer, it was May, I believe that 5.1%. We started to talk about</p>
<p>10 year break evens tips in May of last year. Yeah, so they could have gotten a quarter to</p>
<p>nine months, and they continue not only do they not raise rates, or signal any desire to raise</p>
<p>rates for six months, they continue to quantitative easing for nine months, which just makes no sense.</p>
<p>But they should have taken their foot off the accelerator, right?</p>
<p>Nine months, they only start they only stopped in June of this past year. So we&rsquo;ve only been</p>
<p>quantitatively tightening for two months. They stopped the bond buying program in March.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. Yeah. But they saw quantitative easing in March. But you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that tightening is just something they&rsquo;re getting started with. But the point is,</p>
<p>they should have stopped easing, right? Like, why would you need to keep intervening</p>
<p>in in the in the markets to buy more and to basically push out more money?</p>
<p>Is the reason for this that Powell and Yellen just haven&rsquo;t lived through highly inflationary</p>
<p>times? I just read they&rsquo;re older than I am. They haven&rsquo;t been in office and doing</p>
<p>Fed policy. Like I just read Volcker&rsquo;s book, if you haven&rsquo;t read it, it&rsquo;s pretty great. His</p>
<p>biography. I mean, what he had to do in 8182 was super severe. But we just haven&rsquo;t lived through</p>
<p>this in our lives. So I guess people are just not used to having to tap the brakes in no,</p>
<p>no, look, what happened is that the administration reacted in a political way to the inflation</p>
<p>print, they invented this word, well, the word transitory existed, but they applied it, you heard</p>
<p>this word use relentlessly for about six months. So the administration went into denial mode. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then by the end of the year, it became clear that it was persistent. And I think the issue with</p>
<p>Powell is that he is basically responding to headline risk, right? So he didn&rsquo;t respond to,</p>
<p>you know, the inflation problem last summer, he waits until the headlines tell him he has to</p>
<p>react. And so now the the thing that he&rsquo;s worried about is his recession. Obviously, he knew</p>
<p>no, he&rsquo;s worried about inflation, mostly, right? He was worried about inflation. But if you look</p>
<p>at yesterday&rsquo;s, right, but if you look at his comments yesterday, it was more dovish comments,</p>
<p>they just 75 point rate hike, but the comments were more dovish. And I think it&rsquo;s because he</p>
<p>knows that today we have this second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth. So now he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to balance recession risk against inflation risk. But the point is that the feds been very slow to</p>
<p>react and the administration basically just tries to relabel and rebrand problems instead of</p>
<p>confronting them at all. Hey, Chamath, when we look at this chart, you pulled up four, and we</p>
<p>see this massive spike. Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, little bit in Q3, and then Q4. I mean, this massive 123456,</p>
<p>just extraordinary quarters, or five out of six, in terms of GDP. That&rsquo;s all stimulus in your mind,</p>
<p>right? This is the money drop lockdowns in Q2 2020. Jason, they lock the economy down.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so people were spending online, and we&rsquo;ll get to the Chamath story about Spotify. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all of it. But the point is, it&rsquo;s some combination of lockdown and access money,</p>
<p>right, access money, because, because of loose financial conditions, distort what true supply</p>
<p>and demand should be. Got it, right. And access money can come from the government. But in this</p>
<p>case, access money money went from the government into the hands of individuals who then participated</p>
<p>in the public markets. And they distorted what it what it all looked like. And so there was a lot</p>
<p>of purchasing activity that was propped up by what seemed like an endless supply of free money.</p>
<p>Right. So we know that. Yeah, good. And so now that that money is getting taken out,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t yet know what the real equilibrium economic growth rate should be. Because you</p>
<p>have to remember, we have not seen an era without federally introduced spending,</p>
<p>without federally introduced forms of quantitative easing, since the great financial crisis. So we</p>
<p>have been propping up our economy for 14 years straight now. So we have distorted the prices</p>
<p>of bonds and fixed income. We&rsquo;ve distorted the prices of equities. We&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve created an asset</p>
<p>bubble in crypto out of nowhere. And now we have to do the hard work of figuring out what the real</p>
<p>supply demand is in the economy. And we took six quarters here, there&rsquo;s six quarters of just massive</p>
<p>GDP spike there from the preceding quarters. And we have two down quarters, is it going to take</p>
<p>six quarters to wash us out or longer, I guess, longer, because what David said is now</p>
<p>making the problem even worse. So because Powell was catering to whatever pressure he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>getting, and he must be getting some severe pressure from the White House. Those were</p>
<p>really dovish comments. But what is the problem when he is dovish? Well, the practical reality is</p>
<p>a couple of things. Number one is typically the yields of long dated bonds go down. Okay.</p>
<p>That essentially tells everybody else to reprice assets. What does that practically do? It makes</p>
<p>the cost of borrowing roughly cheaper. Okay? It makes the price of equities, particularly ones</p>
<p>that are far out on the risk spectrum. So specifically, let&rsquo;s focus on NASDAQ and crypto,</p>
<p>right, tech stocks, biotech stocks, and, and crypto stocks go up much more aggressively.</p>
<p>So what is Powell effectively done? He is synthetically created a form of easing,</p>
<p>again, right? Like his job at the Federal Reserve, if you think about the money supply as a pipe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to shrink the pipe to close off demand to get things in equilibrium. So even though he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing this, by the language that he&rsquo;s doing, he&rsquo;s effectively allowing market participants to</p>
<p>basically guess that the worst is over. And now we&rsquo;re going to start to expand the pipe again.</p>
<p>And so they go to the end state. So what he effectively did in one speech is basically put</p>
<p>a pin at the end of this year. And it&rsquo;s telling the markets I&rsquo;m mostly going to be done. And if</p>
<p>anything, I&rsquo;m probably going to be cutting in the back half of 23. Go on your merry way.</p>
<p>And there is no secret.</p>
<p>The problem with that Jason is, it&rsquo;s now pushing the problem out another eight quarters. Like we</p>
<p>need to stop this nonsense. He needs to be definitive. And he needs to fundamentally</p>
<p>break the back of inflation so that you find out what the true demand is in the economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he did point seven, five yesterday, the markets rallied on his sort of the assumption</p>
<p>that he would do a couple of more of these rate hikes, and then he&rsquo;d be done at the second half</p>
<p>of the year. And then hey, maybe we can get back to growth, or some normalcy in real in</p>
<p>really related to all of this. And by the way, there was an interesting story. The sacks would</p>
<p>be interested in how did you read Paul Volcker&rsquo;s biography at sex?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve not read it. It&rsquo;s familiar with his record. But yeah.</p>
<p>Like at one point, Baker, and Ray took Reagan and Volcker into a room off of the White House,</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t recorded, just said, Volcker to Volcker, the President does not want you to</p>
<p>raise rates going into the 84 election, full stop. And Volcker&rsquo;s like, well, I wasn&rsquo;t planning on</p>
<p>raising them. So there&rsquo;s a lot of politics in this, even though people claim</p>
<p>already done enough. I mean, Volcker raised rates all the way up to like 20%. He broke the back of</p>
<p>inflation, it created a very severe recession in I think 1981 82. But by 1983, the economy was</p>
<p>rocketing back. Yeah, with lower interest rates, and they basically solve the inflation problem.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;re not in that situation where Powell has to jack up rates so much to break</p>
<p>the back of inflation, because it means that we&rsquo;d be in an even more serious recession.</p>
<p>So I hope we&rsquo;re not in a Volcker type situation.</p>
<p>Just think about that spread sacks 20% versus like three or 4% we&rsquo;re trying to get to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never in the history of America ever had CPI print above four and a half or 5%</p>
<p>without inflation being brought down by having fed funds not also be greater than four and a</p>
<p>half or 5%. So at some point, inflation will turn over and will print six and 7%.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s still not below four and a half or five. And right now, our target fed funds rate</p>
<p>is between 2.25 and 2.5%. So we could still be only 50% of the way there. If inflation remains</p>
<p>at four to four to 5%. And this is what I think market participants don&rsquo;t want to hear. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to hear that there has to be a meaningful form of tightening. And politicians don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to hear that the White House for sure doesn&rsquo;t want to hear. The problem is that if Powell</p>
<p>caters to too much of that feedback, he&rsquo;s not going to do what he&rsquo;s supposed to do and why</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s put in that job. His job is to get it to 2% and keep price stability and full employment.</p>
<p>I think there is a balance here. I mean, the reality is we do not want Powell tightening</p>
<p>more than he should or more than is necessary to solve inflation because it will cause a serious</p>
<p>recession. So I think we&rsquo;re caught between two pretty bad options here. And it&rsquo;s because I think</p>
<p>that what happened last year contributed to this. I mean, look, if you go back to that chart that</p>
<p>you just showed, what happened in Q2 of 2020, we had a very healthy economy going into 2020 in 2019,</p>
<p>right? And then in Q2 of 2020, we had COVID, but we made the situation even worse with lockdowns.</p>
<p>And we basically shut down the whole economy, brought it back, at least in most states in Q3.</p>
<p>And then the Fed started printing and Congress started printing $10 trillion. Well, still, by</p>
<p>last year, the economy was back, we had something like 5.7% annualized growth. This year, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>negative. Why is that? I mean, this may be the lingering effect of all that stimulus, but I think</p>
<p>that it is, but I do think that the administration made it worse by sending checks into an overheated</p>
<p>economy. They also created energy scarcity. And they just kept, you know, spending more money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the White House isn&rsquo;t without fault, David. But I do think that if all of</p>
<p>these geniuses could have actually just taken a simple econ and stats 101 class and explained how</p>
<p>year over year measurements work to the American people, I think they&rsquo;re smart enough to understand</p>
<p>it. We didn&rsquo;t have to go down this convoluted route, we could have just explained, we put a</p>
<p>lot of excess money in the economy, we don&rsquo;t yet know what the full effect of that is, we need to</p>
<p>let that wash through. In the meantime, you&rsquo;re going to see some crazy numbers from time to time,</p>
<p>and we just have to be patient. And the other crazy things you&rsquo;re going to have looking at second and</p>
<p>third order effects is all these downstream effects, people are making business decisions</p>
<p>going into these economies, Shopify just laid off 10% of its workforce about 1000 people on Tuesday,</p>
<p>their stock is down 10% past five days overall 70% year to date. And if you look at this chart,</p>
<p>and Toby took blame for this, he basically said, Listen, we thought that this was going to be a,</p>
<p>you know, fast forward into the future that people would adopt e commerce in a major way,</p>
<p>and that would stick. Here&rsquo;s us e commerce adoption growth rate massive spike when people</p>
<p>were forced to buy all their goods online. And now it is regressing to the mean.</p>
<p>I mean, mean reversion is a bitch. If you look at Shopify stock, if you look at Peloton stock,</p>
<p>if you look at a firm stock, if you look at arc, you know, a lot of these things were trending in</p>
<p>a great direction. They had this short term, crazy behavior in the middle of all of this free money,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;ve mean reverted. And, you know, we&rsquo;re in the midst of finding out what the real</p>
<p>price is, I got to give Toby a huge, you know, round of applause, because he is such a great CEO.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Last year, in the middle of all of this woke ism, he wrote this incredible</p>
<p>memo, which was, you know, we&rsquo;re not a family, we&rsquo;re a team, which I thought was exceptionally</p>
<p>well written and really got the point across. This time around, he just owned it. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, I made a huge bet that all of this behavior change was going to be discontinuous</p>
<p>and permanent. And it turned out I was wrong. I&rsquo;m sorry for that. And here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to course correct. In both cases, he kind of just put it all out there. And he owned it.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s all you can do when you make a bet. And it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what he said. It&rsquo;s now clear that bet didn&rsquo;t pay off ultimately placed in this bet</p>
<p>was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now we have to adjust as a consequence,</p>
<p>we have to say goodbye to some of you today. And I&rsquo;m deeply sorry for that.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody made that mistake, right? So you know, it is, it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just own it. Everyone was thinking the same thing. We&rsquo;re all we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>how COVID was this acceleration as virus, and it was going to accelerate all these trends. And</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s the acceleration awakening is going to be for all these people who made all these bets,</p>
<p>assuming that it&rsquo;s permanent. And specifically, I mean, you know, especially around real estate</p>
<p>and work from home and all of this stuff, benefits, and it&rsquo;s all going to change now.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is the combination of reversion to the mean will impact a company&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bottom line. And those boards of directors and CEOs will say, Okay, we&rsquo;re just going to have</p>
<p>to reset expectations. And that&rsquo;s going to touch the employees. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw</p>
<p>this leaked transcript. But, you know, Zuck was asked the question from this.</p>
<p>That was classic. That was unbelievable. He was asking about his emotional support days.</p>
<p>I think in the in the middle of like Zuck having like a really serious,</p>
<p>you know, heart to heart with the company about how we&rsquo;re gonna have to buckle down and,</p>
<p>you know, performance, performance, one dude, one dude, you know,</p>
<p>Schmenge from the back racist and he goes, What about the COVID extra vacation days?</p>
<p>Like, he literally his head almost as well. He&rsquo;s like, Did you not just listen to what I said? I</p>
<p>just said, if people are not performing at a high level, maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t be here. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asking me about more days off fire that person to say like, you obviously you don&rsquo;t get it. You</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t listen to anything I said. You&rsquo;re not right for this team at this time. Goodbye. He said a</p>
<p>version of that. He&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a lot of people here that may not be the right.</p>
<p>Friedberg, when we look at these trends, okay, commerce seems like people are going back to</p>
<p>shopping. But I want to ask you about two specific ones. healthcare. It does seem like</p>
<p>telemedicine was one of those things that got accelerated during COVID. Do you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to revert to the mean? Or do you think that, you know, doing doctor&rsquo;s visits over,</p>
<p>you know, FaceTime and text and all these consultations going to stick with us? And</p>
<p>then what about work from home? Because that does not seem to be shifting all that much.</p>
<p>Freebird work, the work from home is not shifting. Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s people are still staying home.</p>
<p>And you know, Amazon just put a hold on six buildings where they said you can finish the</p>
<p>outsides. But let&rsquo;s not do the insides. Because we don&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;re going to do with</p>
<p>these buildings and what hybrids going to look like. And Zuckerberg hasn&rsquo;t been able to get</p>
<p>people to come back to the office. And Apple seems to be getting people two or three days a week. So</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s still been a struggle and downtown San Francisco is empty. So we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>mixed. We&rsquo;re getting mixed results back now, I would say is the best way to describe it. So work</p>
<p>from home and telemedicine. What do you think freebird? I mean, certainly the knowledge economy</p>
<p>seems to prefer work from home. I mean, you&rsquo;re working on a computer, and you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>interact with people. And you got kids, or family, you&rsquo;re inclined to stay home. So that seems to be</p>
<p>a sticking point. You know, younger people probably have their own motivations. But</p>
<p>there was a good stat on telehealth. I&rsquo;m just trying to find it. And I think telehealth surged</p>
<p>during COVID. And 36% of patients used a telehealth service in 2021 420% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>And so despite some reversion post COVID post lockdowns, there&rsquo;s a significant sticking point.</p>
<p>That, and I think 60% of telehealth patients are women. So there&rsquo;s particularly female</p>
<p>services that are being rendered through telehealth at an increasing rate than pre COVID.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff. I mean, look, we&rsquo;ve all had to go sit in the doctor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>for two hours to get some prescription or get a doctor to give us some advice on something</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need to physically check us out for. So you know, it certainly seems to be a</p>
<p>acceleration in that department. offices was the Amazon like was working on 15 warehouses,</p>
<p>they shut down as well, right? I mean, if you guys remember at the start of COVID,</p>
<p>when you place something on Amazon, it was like a two week delay, because they didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>capacity to fulfill the order volume. You know, you look at Toby&rsquo;s chart, it&rsquo;s nearly a doubling</p>
<p>in e commerce volume in a week. When that happens, Amazon&rsquo;s, you know, plus or minus 5%</p>
<p>supply chain has to revert to servicing twice as many customers, it&rsquo;s just not going to happen. So</p>
<p>they overbuilt, tried to get ahead of the curve, remember, they hired like, you know, 100,000</p>
<p>workers. And, you know, they had to make a pipeline for quarters ahead to build warehouses.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re realizing the demand is not going to be there. And they&rsquo;re cutting back on 15</p>
<p>warehouses around the country and not going to build them. They were buying up so many</p>
<p>warehouses that a couple of companies that were looking for warehouses in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>Northern California, and Amazon just bought an option on every single warehouse they could find.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re putting them back on the market. So they, they definitely went too heavy. And then</p>
<p>everybody started betting on Peloton and Teladoc. And if you look at Teladoc, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s off 90% from the peak, I would show the I would show the Peloton chart as well. But</p>
<p>that would just be gratuitous. Some of the stuff to note is like at the end of the day,</p>
<p>whatever product is better for the consumer, they&rsquo;re going to pick,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s the better way to buy shirts? You know, what&rsquo;s the better way to get to find</p>
<p>better? Yeah, I mean, for the consumer, it&rsquo;s like, do you want to try them on? Or do you know your</p>
<p>size, right? Are you buying a brand that you know, in a size, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna buy it online</p>
<p>at this point. I mean, the one thing COVID did is it basically created a trial by fire.</p>
<p>My parents never used DoorDash before COVID. So then they were forced to use DoorDash during</p>
<p>COVID. Now they know what it&rsquo;s like. And so you know, there are now people that never trialed a</p>
<p>lot of these services that have trialed them and are now making decisions based on that experience.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a beautiful example. So just use your parents, why do you think? Let&rsquo;s assume they did,</p>
<p>why do you think they mean reverted to now using DoorDash only in the same percentage as they</p>
<p>would have otherwise x a little bit. I think the quality of the food, the time to wait,</p>
<p>the experience of going out to dinner, there&rsquo;s a lot of motivating factors that are different by</p>
<p>different demos. And so whatever the consumer wants, they&rsquo;re going to pick. If I want to go</p>
<p>have a dining experience in person with my friends, I&rsquo;m going to go do that instead of</p>
<p>sitting at home ordering DoorDash and having everyone come sit on the couch and eat dinner</p>
<p>together. So I think that there&rsquo;s this, you know, this call it mean reversion, but we have seen</p>
<p>call it a broader exposure. And we&rsquo;re really going to see the true market dynamics play out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone wants to buy shoes online. I don&rsquo;t think everyone wants to buy every piece of</p>
<p>clothing online. I think people want to go to the store and try stuff on. I think it&rsquo;s that and I</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s a lot of ancillary social benefits that come with a lot of these activities</p>
<p>that you lose if you just optimize for efficiency. So to your point, like, yeah, you can get a</p>
<p>burrito. But even going to Chipotle with your friend is more fun. Totally get out of the house.</p>
<p>Get out of the house shooting the shit, you know? Yep. It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s the serendipity. Yeah,</p>
<p>you may run into somebody that you nothing beats that. I will tell you, by the way, I do believe</p>
<p>that there is a counter narrative to the idea of work from home and e commerce moving together.</p>
<p>I think as people work from home, they want to go be in person for other activities more.</p>
<p>Yes. The more you&rsquo;re working from home, the more you want to go to dinner with people or lunch to</p>
<p>people. Yeah, or you want to go shop in person, because you&rsquo;re stuck in the house all day,</p>
<p>and you want to go do other stuff. And so if you&rsquo;re working in the office, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do more e commerce. And if you&rsquo;re working at home, you&rsquo;re probably going to do less e commerce. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably some net net balance. We saw both of them rise together during COVID. But now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more of an equilibrium being reached. Well, I mean, if you don&rsquo;t, by the way, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re change your behavior may stay home for three days straight. And all of a sudden, remember,</p>
<p>and just remember 60% of the US population lives in urban areas where this is kind of an effective</p>
<p>kind of conversation we&rsquo;re having. I think outside of that, it&rsquo;s a very different world.</p>
<p>And so for 40% of Americans, this is not like the conversation that you know,</p>
<p>in deeply suburban and rural areas. Do you guys know what shadow ghost quitting is?</p>
<p>You know what ghost quitting is? Go. So I saw it on TikTok. You stop you stop working.</p>
<p>I saw it on TikTok, but you&rsquo;re still getting paid. It&rsquo;s when you decide to quit mentally,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t actually quit. And so you basically get out get off the corporate rat race by doing the</p>
<p>bare minimum to not get fired at a company. Oh, like sacks during the science segment.</p>
<p>And so I, you know, I think that there&rsquo;s all of these like invented things that people do,</p>
<p>that they think they can get away with, which they generally can in a moment of prosperity,</p>
<p>where in a moment of actually like buckling down when earnings matter, and profits matter,</p>
<p>and investor pressure matters, all of this stuff, I think is going to mean revert. So this is sort of</p>
<p>my my opinion on all of this, which is, I think that most of these behaviors will eventually</p>
<p>take over. But it&rsquo;s still many years away. And right now, we have to go through the process</p>
<p>of just getting back to where we were meant to be in the first place.</p>
<p>I think one area with significant disequilibrium right now, I mean, to your point is productivity,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard to assess and qualify productivity for knowledge workers in this</p>
<p>environment. And this is for employed base, right? Remember, we talked about last time,</p>
<p>like a large percentage of the US workforce has moved to more of an independent contractor,</p>
<p>sole service provider kind of model for how they&rsquo;re interacting and working in the world.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about knowledge workers in an employed environment. And it is becoming difficult</p>
<p>for managers and for companies to assess, you know, the quality and the level of work being</p>
<p>produced relative to its potential. It&rsquo;s not the same as it used to be when you&rsquo;d be able to have</p>
<p>in person monitoring and interaction. And so, you know, I saw a stat the other day,</p>
<p>where it was like, most companies are asking workers to come home, most of the workers are</p>
<p>to come to the office, most of the workers are saying no. And then most of the bosses don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what to say in response. And they&rsquo;re still sitting on the sidelines, like, okay,</p>
<p>okay, don&rsquo;t come to work. Okay, fired. Yeah. And so there is this signal. And by the way,</p>
<p>this may yield a competitive advantage for businesses in the marketplace that figure out</p>
<p>how to assess productivity and how to assess performance in their organization right now,</p>
<p>in this rapidly shifted, totally different workforce than what we had a few years ago,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so easy to take four hours off in the afternoon, go to lunch, hang out, have beers,</p>
<p>come back, get back online, get back on Slack, do stuff. And so there&rsquo;s this real challenge,</p>
<p>I think, for organizations and a real disequilibrium of productivity and output right</p>
<p>now. I&rsquo;ve had to do you guys look at the tech talks of these people that are like, yes, in the</p>
<p>life of like a Google engineer or day in the life they work for 30 hours at the gym work. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. They&rsquo;re literally smoking weed and playing video games. And everyone knows cats. Managers</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Managers know it. Senior VPs know it. The CEOs know it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this is my point. People just don&rsquo;t know how to manage it. It&rsquo;s a real I figured out. It&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>disequilibrium in the workforce, because the way you manage it before is everyone would show up to</p>
<p>work or they wouldn&rsquo;t. Someone&rsquo;s not in the office, they&rsquo;re not working, they get fired.</p>
<p>Now, what do you do? You know, we and no one wants to be monitored. No one wants to manage</p>
<p>keystrokes through a friggin remote computer and figure out how much you&rsquo;re typing. Actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting. You mentioned what you do, J. Cal to your employees. No, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>no. There are people doing that call centers actually do that. So call centers and sales</p>
<p>teams. They have monitoring software, customer service and call centers. Totally. Yeah, sales</p>
<p>people, you can totally track productivity. I&rsquo;m talking about creators, producers, right? Like,</p>
<p>yeah, I actually have come up with some strategies for this. So we have a lot of writers doing</p>
<p>newsletters and stuff like that. And so we did was we created a block in the afternoon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been testing where three writers will get together in a pod and they work on a newsletter</p>
<p>together. So instead of three writers writing three different newsletters, you have three</p>
<p>writers collaborate on three different newsletters, they do one for two hours, one for two, one for</p>
<p>90 minutes, one for 90 minutes, whatever three people read the newsletters. Well, it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>four or $5 million. I think it&rsquo;s hundreds of 1000s of people a day, but okay. But anyway,</p>
<p>the point is, I didn&rsquo;t mention the name of the company. There&rsquo;s no plugin here. But</p>
<p>by putting people into a zoom, yeah, no, no, you put people in a zoom or a huddle on Slack,</p>
<p>which is like an audio only. And then they have to deliver work to each other. It&rsquo;s kind of how</p>
<p>developers work or sales teams work with leads. And then in programming, like pair programs,</p>
<p>like pure program, exactly. And then with and it also makes people less lonely, and it builds</p>
<p>social fabric. So there are techniques that are emerging. The other one I&rsquo;ve looked at is I tell</p>
<p>anybody, if you&rsquo;re doing any type of knowledge work, you need to create a notion or a coda page,</p>
<p>depending on what you use, and update us on that, and then send it to the group chat, you know,</p>
<p>to the general channel, hey, I was working on the strategy for this. So when people say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on strategy, I have them documented. And I say share us share with us the Google Doc,</p>
<p>and I use the Amazon six page, you know, philosophy of a right first culture. And now people have to</p>
<p>write it down. So I&rsquo;ve been teaching people how to write use Grammarly or Hemingway app to be</p>
<p>better writers. And then what you can do is as a manager, you can just look at your notion or your</p>
<p>coda and see the changelog. And when I see people in a changelog, and I see they made no commits,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what is this person doing? They said they did all the strategy stuff. Where is it?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the strategy stuff, write it down. So if you switch to a right first culture, and then</p>
<p>train people how to write and become more confident writers, all that knowledge gets captured on your</p>
<p>knowledge base. And you can actually see people getting done. It&rsquo;s not perfect. But I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually intellectually better than being in an office if you know how to do it. Because in an</p>
<p>office, people are also performative, they&rsquo;re doing like bullshit meetings, they&rsquo;re pretending</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working, they they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re actually reading the news, or, you know, whatever. So sex,</p>
<p>what are you doing to monitor your employees covertly and keep them productive?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to monitor our employees that way. Because we&rsquo;re a small team of yes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re highly motivated, you know, but look, it is an issue. I don&rsquo;t, I think where work from home</p>
<p>is beneficial is on the hiring side, right? It&rsquo;s so much easier to hire for a job. When your</p>
<p>potential pool is anyone in the world, you&rsquo;re not just geographically limited to the city in which</p>
<p>your office is. So that was the temptation for all these companies to go remote is it made hiring so</p>
<p>much easier. But there&rsquo;s no question that it makes management much harder and scaling the company</p>
<p>much harder and building culture much harder. And so there&rsquo;s some real trade offs there. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think companies totally wrap their heads around it. But look, in addition to productivity, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one other aspect of this economy that I think is really broken. So the Chamber of Commerce says</p>
<p>that 3.25 million fewer Americans are working today than they were in February of 2020. So</p>
<p>basically, if you go back to the month before COVID, we had over 3 million more Americans in</p>
<p>jobs than we do today. And yet the unemployment rate is still in the 3% range. And the reason is</p>
<p>because that if somebody drops out of the labor force and isn&rsquo;t looking for work, they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>counted on the unemployment rate. So we do have, if you define unemployment as a large number of</p>
<p>people who aren&rsquo;t working, we have a huge unemployment problem. But the problem is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not counted because they&rsquo;re supposedly not looking for work. So I don&rsquo;t think this</p>
<p>economy is that healthy. And I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of distortions that have been created</p>
<p>by government in the last couple of years. The job data is suspect is what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>right? Like labor participation is down. All this data, the data is suspect, the labels are</p>
<p>suspect. I mean, like we talked about, all of a sudden, we can&rsquo;t know what a recession is. And</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just bring up one other thing that just happened today. So Manchin cut a deal with Schumer</p>
<p>to bring back a slimmed down version of BBB. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s not $4 trillion like Biden</p>
<p>wanted. It&rsquo;s $750 trillion, okay? But what are they calling it? Billion, right. Okay. So,</p>
<p>you know, thankfully, it&rsquo;s a slimmed down bill. But what are they calling this? They&rsquo;re all of</p>
<p>a sudden calling it the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It&rsquo;s like, are you kidding? This doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pass the lab test. Are they trolling us with the names of these bills? The bills are never what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the bill. Why don&rsquo;t they just call it the green energy bill and the screw private equity bill? I</p>
<p>mean, that&rsquo;s basically what it is. Yeah, well, inflation reduction sells to everyone, right?</p>
<p>But Jason, the media, the media is not holding the administration accountable. If we had,</p>
<p>if we had an honest media, they the headline today would be you&rsquo;re not going to get it from</p>
<p>left the station sacks. We can only get it on this pod or other podcasts. Yeah. What did</p>
<p>President Manchin get for this deal? He agreed to it. What did President Manchin get?</p>
<p>Well, he secured some bag, right? Did you see what I said during the group chat?</p>
<p>What did he agree? He&rsquo;s like, I got a pipeline. There&rsquo;s going to be huge handouts and pork for</p>
<p>the state of West Virginia. There&rsquo;s no question about it. I mean, if you look at this bill,</p>
<p>okay, they, I mean, let me just, we should just look at what&rsquo;s in it. And more and more is going</p>
<p>to come out over the next few weeks, right? It&rsquo;s only one day old. So we&rsquo;re going to learn a lot</p>
<p>more about what&rsquo;s in this. But the largest Republicans feel like, can you explain the</p>
<p>dynamic as well, after you get through this, of why the Republicans felt like now that he</p>
<p>double crossed them, because the Democrats felt double crossed by managed President Manchin.</p>
<p>And now the Republicans are feeling double crossed by President Manchin.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know that you can use the word double cross because he&rsquo;s not a Republican,</p>
<p>and he had no obligation. But look, there&rsquo;s no question that Manchin went back on what he said</p>
<p>just a few weeks ago, he was saying that Build Back Better was unacceptable, because it would</p>
<p>contribute to the inflation problem. In fact, he&rsquo;s been saying that since last summer, he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>saying that we have a growing inflation problem, we can&rsquo;t contribute to it with a lot more</p>
<p>government spending. Now, he&rsquo;s agreed to a $750 billion, of which something like 450 is new</p>
<p>spending. So yeah, it&rsquo;s a smaller package than we had before. But if your concern was inflation,</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, you can&rsquo;t justify this, you certainly can&rsquo;t call it an inflation reduction</p>
<p>act. I mean, that&rsquo;s just patently dishonest. Well, how do they come up with it? Being inflation</p>
<p>reduction? Is it because the healthcare stuff is theoretically going to help consumers have</p>
<p>more money to spend? Because I think it&rsquo;s a 10, it&rsquo;s a tenuous argument. But if you want to,</p>
<p>if you want to make the argument, there&rsquo;s some cap on what seniors pay for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And then there are subsidies for people who are in the market for an electric vehicle. However,</p>
<p>those are small adjustments. Those are small rebates to a small segment of the population.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can argue in good faith that this bill will reduce CPI. That&rsquo;s just not a</p>
<p>plausible argument. And the vast majority of the bill, like you said, are subsidies for clean</p>
<p>energy, which are basically handouts to special interests in the donor class in the Democratic</p>
<p>Party, just to itemize some of these things. So the largest single outlay, $60 billion,</p>
<p>is for quote, environmental justice initiatives to address the unequal effects of pollution on</p>
<p>low income communities and communities of color. This includes $3 billion to invest in community</p>
<p>led projects in disadvantaged communities, another $3 billion to support neighborhood equity, safety</p>
<p>and affordable transportation access, another $30 billion shoveled to states in the form of grant</p>
<p>and loan programs for state&rsquo;s electric utilities to advance the green energy transition, $30 billion</p>
<p>for additional production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind</p>
<p>turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing. So it&rsquo;s basically going to companies,</p>
<p>right? $20 billion in loans to build new clean vehicle manufacturing facilities across the US</p>
<p>and $2 billion to revamp existing auto plants to make clean vehicles, $20 billion for the</p>
<p>agricultural sector to quote curb emissions, $3 billion to reduce air pollution at ports,</p>
<p>$10 billion investment tax credit to manufacturing facilities for things like electric vehicles,</p>
<p>wind turbines, and solar panels. It seems redundant to the $30 billion outlay I just</p>
<p>mentioned, but it&rsquo;s another giveaway to democratic donors. And wouldn&rsquo;t that be good for Chamath</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that spending be good for energy independence in addition to climate because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about being energy independent, if we have more EVs, more batteries, more solar,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing, right? We want to be energy independent. So this seems like we get two wins,</p>
<p>or possibly three one, we get economic activity to we reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And</p>
<p>three, we stopped burning a hole in the ozone and increasing the temperature of the planet</p>
<p>seems like three good things. We have to I think we have to see the forest and the trees here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s one good part of this bill. And then there&rsquo;s the kind of more ugly reality</p>
<p>that it avoids. The ugly reality is, unfortunately, or fortunately, or maybe without taking emotion</p>
<p>of it, we are dependent on fossil fuels for a very long time. It is a necessary bridge fuel.</p>
<p>And so we need to if we&rsquo;re talking about energy independence, it can&rsquo;t happen without us,</p>
<p>frankly, drilling more, and subsidizing the capital incentives of private companies to go</p>
<p>and do this exploration work, which they have stopped Jason. And the reason they&rsquo;ve stopped is</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t trust that these oil prices will stay this high. And so they don&rsquo;t want to make</p>
<p>these outlays and investments for the next five to 10 years, because they&rsquo;re worried that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a rug pull, which did happen to them in the back half of last decade and the early</p>
<p>parts of this decade. So they&rsquo;re like once bitten twice shy, they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not going to touch</p>
<p>this. So you&rsquo;re saying oil companies that would do some exploration, it would cost them whatever</p>
<p>amount $2 to get the gasoline out to get the gasoline out of the earth and then process it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re afraid it&rsquo;s going to be negative. They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to sell that gasoline.</p>
<p>I think I think they&rsquo;re afraid that, you know, the United States government may</p>
<p>impinge on their ability to actually process it, that it may there may be tariffs and costs and</p>
<p>taxes that they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll be upside down forecast, they&rsquo;ll be upside down. So they just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be and right now, when you saw this, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw but like shell and</p>
<p>Exxon, and these guys are printing enormous record profits. So their incentives to change</p>
<p>the status quo right now is zero. They want less supply, because then they can raise prices,</p>
<p>they have the perfect situation right now, which is it&rsquo;s an incredibly energy intensive world we</p>
<p>live in. And we don&rsquo;t have nearly enough energy to do the work that needs to get done. And by the</p>
<p>way, and you saw this this week already, where, you know, Putin cut Nord Stream by another 50%,</p>
<p>it was already running at 40% capacity, he cut it down to 20%. It&rsquo;s only getting worse.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I think this bill could be good. I haven&rsquo;t looked at the specifics to</p>
<p>give you a very, well, the specifics aren&rsquo;t even out. I did see the EV credits, Friedberg. And</p>
<p>I thought that these were particularly well constructed 7500 bucks off of a new car, but</p>
<p>you have to be in the 150k salary or less on your taxes of rich people can&rsquo;t get these. And it can</p>
<p>only be for an $80,000 new car, a $50,000 or $25,000 used. And so they did seem to be started</p>
<p>pretty well. And I do know that those incentives did work in the early days of Tesla. Because</p>
<p>when you went to the website, you would look at the price. And, you know, this would be 10% off</p>
<p>of a new car. And they did drive sales. And it was pretty significant. What are your thoughts</p>
<p>on the EV tax credits? That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s a wise thing. And then what do you think, overall,</p>
<p>about spending a couple $100 billion on reducing emissions and becoming more energy independent at</p>
<p>the same time? It seems like a laudable strategy to you? Nope, seems like a total waste of money.</p>
<p>Okay, unpack it, please. The EV tax credit is just giving away money to EV car manufacturers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already enough demand, the prices are low enough. There&rsquo;s enough consumer interest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough consumer intent, I don&rsquo;t think you need to put this money out there distorts a market</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already functioning well. And this goes back to my point about the role of, you know,</p>
<p>government and how we create, you know, create incentives or spend money. This is not a place</p>
<p>we need to be spending money because there isn&rsquo;t an absolute need. There&rsquo;s no data that indicates</p>
<p>that this will accelerate a transition to a carbon free economy or that it&rsquo;s even needed.</p>
<p>It really is a point of view that people hold and they believe that EVs are good,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good for climate change, we should accelerate it, therefore, we should spend money</p>
<p>on it, without any accountability or proof that these tax credits will actually motivate a market</p>
<p>to move faster or quicker than it is already moving. And so it is just spending taxpayer dollars</p>
<p>that could theoretically not be spent, or be spent in a more effective way to improve the</p>
<p>lives of people broadly in this country. So yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t fully agree that I haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>any data that tells me this makes sense. Anecdotally, I don&rsquo;t think $7,500 off of</p>
<p>$75,000 EV is attractive. $7,000 GM and others have great low priced TVs, and there&rsquo;s a ton of</p>
<p>market demand and they can&rsquo;t keep up with production. And you know, giving people $7,500</p>
<p>off a car that manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with making because there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>demand already, you don&rsquo;t need to do it, it is so much cheaper to drive an electric vehicle now,</p>
<p>by plugging this thing in and spending money on gas that people already want to buy these things,</p>
<p>they pay for themselves, super fast. Every consumer wants to save money on transportation,</p>
<p>and you will save money by buying an electric vehicle. So you will already buy an electric</p>
<p>vehicle, you don&rsquo;t need government money to get you to buy an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>To Friberg&rsquo;s point, there was a lot of analysis that&rsquo;s been done on consumer adoption patterns.</p>
<p>And typically for a new good or service, the tipping point is around 5% mass market adoption</p>
<p>from when it goes from early adopters to the mass market. And EVs just cross 5%. So to his point,</p>
<p>the historical data would tell you that we&rsquo;re now past the critical point where it&rsquo;s no longer</p>
<p>questionable now it&rsquo;s just going to happen. So it&rsquo;s not early adopters, we&rsquo;re getting to the</p>
<p>mass market.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll tell you like the best the best thing about EV adoption,</p>
<p>or for me for having an EV is never having to go to the gas station.</p>
<p>Amazing. Amazing. Yeah.</p>
<p>I just just that one thing is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you guys currently it&rsquo;s about 34.6 kilowatt hours per 100 miles. Okay, I&rsquo;ll just get</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do some math together. Let&rsquo;s say kilowatt hour in the US costs about 10 cents.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s about $3 and 50 cents to drive 100 miles in an electric car. That&rsquo;s a lot cheaper</p>
<p>than paying $15 for gas to drive the same distance in a gas car. You don&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>tax credit to get people to buy these things. These cars are financeable. There&rsquo;s a very liquid,</p>
<p>very active lending market. You get paid back on these cars within a year.</p>
<p>Better would you direct if you were going to direct some stimulus to</p>
<p>I would not say anything right now. We don&rsquo;t we just talked about how we don&rsquo;t need to stimulate</p>
<p>the economy. I would not know where the economy I&rsquo;m talking about to you believe global warming</p>
<p>is happening, Friedberg. Yes. Look, you want my point of view on climate change and industry.</p>
<p>I think I think humans, I think humans are on a driven, naturally market driven path</p>
<p>to resolving carbon output in our industrial systems. And I don&rsquo;t think that government</p>
<p>intervention with tax credits and specific consumer products is actually going to accelerate</p>
<p>or resolve. You know, these changes that are needed, we need to not change consumer behavior,</p>
<p>consumers always want to have cheaper, faster, better. What we need, you know, at the end of</p>
<p>the day, what we need to do is change the way that we&rsquo;re producing and making things, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ultimately what&rsquo;s going to drive this transition. And guess what, consumers are</p>
<p>demanding things that are, you know, more efficient that are more effective and efficiency ultimately</p>
<p>resolves to less carbon ultimately resolves to less land, less energy, and industry has always</p>
<p>resolved to greater efficiency, natural market forces improve the efficiency of every industrial</p>
<p>system. So stimulus not necessary, mankind is ever created. And I think it is it is a matter of</p>
<p>time, and a matter of natural evolution that we will resolve all of the factors that are driving</p>
<p>climate change from animal agriculture, to transportation systems to energy systems,</p>
<p>these are all going to get completely really do it in time. We absolutely will. And at the end of</p>
<p>the day, we can pull carbon out of the atmosphere and resolve it into products. We have tools to do</p>
<p>that as well. So I am an eternal optimist. But in this particular case, I think that this century,</p>
<p>much of what we&rsquo;re throwing our hands about, and you remember, at the beginning of the 20th</p>
<p>century, we thought we were going to run out of food. Then suddenly, we invented the Haber-Bosch</p>
<p>process and created fertilizer out of air. It was an incredible, incredible invention that</p>
<p>saved mankind. We have had time and time again in the history of humanity, these thoughts that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in an existential crisis, we thought we would have peak oil, and we have had these, and</p>
<p>we have had these points of view that we&rsquo;re in an existential crisis, and humanity is about to end.</p>
<p>And every single time, we figured out a way out of it. And we didn&rsquo;t figure out a way out of it,</p>
<p>because the government came along and said, here&rsquo;s a tax credit. And we&rsquo;ve gotten sick. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten drunk on government spending. And we think that it is the solution to every problem we have</p>
<p>as a species. You know, the biggest solution to our problems is our ingenuity. And then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>let the markets figure it out. Consumers are smart, businesses are smart, they will figure</p>
<p>out ways to resolve these solutions, they don&rsquo;t need to have these handouts. And I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a really important point that we&rsquo;ve kind of missed. And I&rsquo;ll say, we were talking</p>
<p>earlier about the economy, this stimulus, we&rsquo;ve been giving ourselves caffeine since 2008, when</p>
<p>the Fed started to build up this balance sheet. And we got used to the idea. Remember, before this,</p>
<p>it was like, oh my god, multi million dollar bills, and then it became multi billion dollar</p>
<p>bills, then we had an $800 billion bay out in 2008. And suddenly, it was the multiple of 100</p>
<p>billion and the multiple of a trillion. And this expectation now we&rsquo;ve kind of reset the clock,</p>
<p>and everything now is in what multiple of 100 billion or what multiple of trillion we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to spend on stuff. And no one&rsquo;s even batting an eye at the size of these, the bills anymore.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what is a bigger existential threat to the United States? Is it climate? Or is it</p>
<p>overspending by our government?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s over. I think the biggest threat is, is productivity. I think that as a society,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that we are so well off, that we have so many things that we don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have 50 years ago, and you know, read Pinker&rsquo;s book on enlightenment now,</p>
<p>and just go through those 200 charts he puts in there, it will blow your mind. And if you</p>
<p>actually sit down and think about it and have a broader perspective on where we sit in this</p>
<p>country today, versus where we were 100 years, 50 years, even 30 years ago, you will say, Oh,</p>
<p>my God, we live in an absolute luxury estate in this country, golden and golden era. And</p>
<p>it is a condition that unfortunately, reaps, you know, a decline in productivity, because at that</p>
<p>point, we&rsquo;re entitled to some degree, some people are entitled, there are many people in this</p>
<p>country that are still very hungry. There are many people in this country that still want to progress.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think a lot of the the lax behavior from government entities actually</p>
<p>holds us back from accelerating our productivity outbreaks, because it gives people many incentives</p>
<p>and many reasons and industry, many incentives and many reasons to not solve problems. And I</p>
<p>think that we solve problems, and we&rsquo;re left to our own. There was an article I posted, Nick,</p>
<p>you can put it in about the Congo, and that they&rsquo;ve decided to auction a bunch of land to</p>
<p>oil companies. And I think before, they tried to heed sort of, you know, the West&rsquo;s directives,</p>
<p>and they said, Okay, well, let&rsquo;s build a land bank, and we&rsquo;ll put a bunch of money in. And so</p>
<p>then the, you know, people in the in the Congo will have money for things. And you won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to sell off the oil rights, and only 10s of millions of dollars showed up. And then the</p>
<p>Congolese were like, they threw up their hand, I&rsquo;ll just read the quote, because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting. Congo&rsquo;s sole goal for the auction, said the government official is to earn enough</p>
<p>revenue to help the struggling nation finance programs to reduce poverty and generate badly</p>
<p>needed economic growth. That is our priority. He said, our priority is not to save the planet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite a stark statement when you read it. But But the reality is, in one generation,</p>
<p>what will happen is they will feed the world&rsquo;s desire for fossil fuels that will generate a lot</p>
<p>of revenue. Hopefully, it doesn&rsquo;t get pilfered. And so it gets invested in healthcare and education.</p>
<p>And within a generation, this country could be in a completely different situation,</p>
<p>allowing the productivity of that entire population of that country to do what they think is right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m generally of the belief that that that freebergs right on this.</p>
<p>Do you think that we should subsidize EVs to increase the percentage and then also for solar</p>
<p>just give me those two Chamath solar and EVs? Do you think they should be subsidized or not?</p>
<p>In the United States, it depends on how and at what point of the market cycle, the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>job is to create economic incentives that tip the balance of power towards investment. So if you are</p>
<p>sitting here 15 years ago, the price of solar panels was sky high. It was incomprehensible</p>
<p>that we could make solar equivalent to any other form of energy. The only way that we were able to</p>
<p>close the gap was through government subsidies. But what that did was allow a bunch of companies</p>
<p>to build businesses to make revenues, and then also to make profits that then the public markets</p>
<p>valued. Those public markets then put pressure on those companies to take those profits to become</p>
<p>more efficient to make the panels cheaper. And 15 years later, we&rsquo;re now at parity. So that was a</p>
<p>really great example of the government stepping in to smooth out an imbalance in the investment</p>
<p>incentive of the private markets. That is where they are exceptional. So in any market, they should</p>
<p>be able to do this. But I think what freeberg is saying is when then they do do it successfully,</p>
<p>and a market starts to germinate on its own, where supply and demand happens naturally between the</p>
<p>private markets, the worst thing a government can do is step in, because it completely perturbs</p>
<p>what true supply or true demand is. And that is what causes all of this crazy stuff that we deal</p>
<p>with J Cal fast forward, assume that there&rsquo;s a $7,500 tax credit for EVs that artificially makes</p>
<p>EVs cheaper, and then a better technology than EVs comes along, let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s some nuclear</p>
<p>fusion, cold fusion, Mr. Fusion car, like from back to the future. And that car inevitably has</p>
<p>to fight against the cheaper car, because the cheaper car is subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>We see this in a lot of markets that already exist in food, in energy, in infrastructure,</p>
<p>where government subsidies that are embedded in the operating model of that industry,</p>
<p>and that industry becomes kind of reliant and dependent on it totally distorts the ability for</p>
<p>the market to naturally transition to a more productive, more efficient state. And that more</p>
<p>productive, more efficient state ultimately is cheaper, better for consumers and better for the</p>
<p>planet. And we&rsquo;re we hold ourselves back when we insert government dollars into well functioning</p>
<p>markets. I do think the government has an important role, as I mentioned last time,</p>
<p>in pure science, in seeding new markets and seeding these opportunities in identifying paths</p>
<p>that are quantum leap efficiency improvements in production systems in industrial systems in ways</p>
<p>of living. Once those have been identified, if those breakthroughs have been kind of catalyzed,</p>
<p>boom, let the market take off because it&rsquo;s gonna take off. But we shouldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>EVs and solar are there already. Absolutely. They&rsquo;re cheaper. And so let me point let me</p>
<p>just give you one one point of reference. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s use Chemoff&rsquo;s Congolese example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that there&rsquo;s someone that lives in the Congo. And I said to this person who&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>subsisting on less than $3,000 a year of income. And they&rsquo;re probably living, you know, day to day</p>
<p>on finding food. And you said to this person in the United States, they have these cars, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called electric cars, and they&rsquo;re cheaper than gas cars. And they&rsquo;re, you make more money, or you</p>
<p>save money by buying one of these cars, and they&rsquo;re cheaper now. And we&rsquo;re giving people $7,500 to buy</p>
<p>one, this person who&rsquo;s making three grand a year would say what it is a state of luxury that allows</p>
<p>us to do this. And frankly, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a state of excess abundance. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>most worried about. sax, what are your thoughts on the government giving these type of subsidies</p>
<p>to accelerate solar and EVs? The whole bill seems anachronistic. You know, first of all, it&rsquo;s raising</p>
<p>taxes by 739 billion at a time when we&rsquo;re entering a recession. I don&rsquo;t know any economists who thinks</p>
<p>that tax increases help the economy. We just talked about how the economy is in a really tenuous</p>
<p>position. So this is not the right medicine right now. Then you&rsquo;ve got the fact that the vast</p>
<p>majority of the spending this bill goes to these, you know, energy subsidies, which are just, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to help the average person, there&rsquo;s very little money in this bill that helps the average</p>
<p>working class person. These are basically handouts, there&rsquo;s basically pork barrel spending for</p>
<p>Democratic Party donors and special interests. And like Freeberg, I think just articulated very well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not necessary right now. The what&rsquo;s driving demand for electric vehicles and solar</p>
<p>panels and so on, is first of all, the products just keep getting better and better. And second,</p>
<p>they keep moving down the cost curve as technology and innovation gets better, these products get</p>
<p>cheaper. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fundamentally driving the demand. We don&rsquo;t need the government now.</p>
<p>Again, we need to accelerate it</p>
<p>in an anachronistic way to shovel out all this money at a time we can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m glad that 300 billion of the bill is supposedly going to deficit reduction. I hope</p>
<p>those numbers actually materialize. But we&rsquo;re still 30 trillion in debt. And now that interest</p>
<p>rates have gone from basically zero to around 3%. The imputed debt service on our debts basically</p>
<p>gone has increased by almost a trillion dollars. That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>So just like somebody who had a variable mortgage, the United States is on a variable mortgage with</p>
<p>our debt. And so when interest rates go up, we&rsquo;re gonna have to pay</p>
<p>more interest.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So if interest rates stay at this, call it 3% level, which is roughly where the 10</p>
<p>year T-bill has been bouncing around at, that is a lot of debt service, a trillion dollars a year</p>
<p>of debt service. So I think we&rsquo;re probably entering an era, an overall era of austerity</p>
<p>that lasts more than just this year or even this presidency. And I think we&rsquo;ll look back at all this</p>
<p>wasteful spending, this last 10, 20 trillion of spending as money we didn&rsquo;t need to spend,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be paying for, for a long time. So to be shoveling out another 300 billion plus of</p>
<p>these programs, and again, once again, going to corporations and special interests, not to the</p>
<p>average, you know, person who needs it. It&rsquo;s just so irresponsible.</p>
<p>I have a question for Friedberg. One of the one of your exceptions there was</p>
<p>investments in science. You want to talk about your opinion on the quality of the grant process</p>
<p>at the NIH and whether we are doing the real work necessary to get the right things funded?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a good transition to what happened this week, which was that there was</p>
<p>a major potential fraud uncovered in Alzheimer&rsquo;s research, which has led to over a billion and a</p>
<p>half dollars of funding and grants being given out to follow on Alzheimer&rsquo;s research programs</p>
<p>in the years that followed this initial paper. So, you know, in 2006, there was a paper published</p>
<p>in the journal nature about amyloid beta proteins that impaired memory and brains, which then became</p>
<p>kind of the leading theory for the cause and the driver of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. And much of the</p>
<p>research and funding that followed from there, which is now up to nine,</p>
<p>several billion dollars in total funding in private and public institutions. Last year alone,</p>
<p>the NIH funded $287 million in research into amyloid beta. And it turns out that the initial</p>
<p>paper was shown to be fraudulent. And so, you know, just recently, the Journal of Science</p>
<p>published in detail, an analysis of the photos of the Western blot measurements, the protein</p>
<p>recognition images that the scientists used in this initial paper were forged,</p>
<p>and that many papers of his were then forged years later. And this paper is one of the most cited</p>
<p>papers in Alzheimer&rsquo;s research. And much of the work that&rsquo;s been done on Alzheimer&rsquo;s came out of</p>
<p>this. And if you guys remember, last year, we talked about that biogen drug, that biogen drug</p>
<p>is meant to stop amyloid beta plaque. And you know, the projection is that Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug and</p>
<p>remember, there was a panel of scientists that looked at the data for that drug that biogen got</p>
<p>approval for from the FDA. And they all said this does not show conclusively in any way that it</p>
<p>improves Alzheimer&rsquo;s. And the FDA still approved the drug, because so much of the NIH funding went</p>
<p>into the research for amyloid beta. And so the assumption has always been, this is the cause of</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s, this is the way to resolve it. And everyone gets so strongly held in that core belief.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much money behind it, that we can&rsquo;t turn away and say maybe we&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And this is the problem when science meets money. Once you go from funding something,</p>
<p>and then suddenly a whole bunch more money pours into it, everyone&rsquo;s gonna look bad. And everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fall apart. And everyone fears that the system fails. If you realize that something you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t said was so totally wrong. We can even argue this is what happened recently with COVID,</p>
<p>the masks, the vaccines, all of the statements that were made that you have to keep doubling down.</p>
<p>Every system has bad actors, you know, people plagiarize fraud, whatever, is this like a</p>
<p>systematic thing? And doesn&rsquo;t science protect against this? Because people then do double</p>
<p>blind studies and try to replicate studies, two things, because like Jason Blair eventually got</p>
<p>caught right at the New York Times, it was only a matter of time before somebody said, like,</p>
<p>his description of my back porch was not accurate. And I never talked to this journal,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re a smart up and coming scientist. Your job is to is to publish research</p>
<p>that gets attention. And that you can then go raise grants from the NIH and others from on.</p>
<p>So you want to get some good papers out, you want to get attention. And then you want to forward the</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s already being done. It is to no one&rsquo;s incentive to go out and try and retest</p>
<p>something that someone&rsquo;s already published on. Even though that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do in</p>
<p>science. There&rsquo;s no motivation. There&rsquo;s no dollars to do this. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a disincentive to your</p>
<p>career. It&rsquo;s a disincentive to your ability as a scientist to source funding and to source grants</p>
<p>to go back and retest assumptions that are already strongly held beliefs in the industry. I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you another strong example that just came out two weeks ago. You know, you guys heard of SSRI</p>
<p>antidepressant drugs, right? 37 million Americans are on these drugs. The market is is projected to</p>
<p>be at about 25 billion in the next few years. That&rsquo;s how much Americans are spending on these</p>
<p>on these antidepressant drugs, half a sacks, but yes, go on. Right. So there was a paper published</p>
<p>in nature a few weeks ago. And the nature journal pulled all the research and all the data from</p>
<p>17 other studies that was across several hundred thousand patients. And their conclusion was that</p>
<p>there is effectively no proof that these SSRI drugs have an effect on depression have a positive</p>
<p>effect on depression, that, you know, serotonin and the idea that, you know, serotonin uptake</p>
<p>should kind of have a driving effect on depression. And this has been the assumption that&rsquo;s been held</p>
<p>now. For you know, for many years, I mean, you know, I think the original paper on this was</p>
<p>published probably north of 20 years ago, but the industry is so big, right? The drug companies are</p>
<p>making 2025 billion dollars a year on this drug on these drugs. And scientists are incentivized</p>
<p>to further that research that supports that research. And so they can go out and get NIH</p>
<p>grants because it&rsquo;s already an SEC accepted, proven belief that this is there a solution to</p>
<p>this, like for every dollar that&rsquo;s spent on primary, you know, $1 needs to be sent on</p>
<p>double blind testing it and making sure that it&rsquo;s accurate. Should there because we have this issue</p>
<p>in journalism, right? Everybody&rsquo;s a content creator, reblogger and opinion journalist.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s very few now investigative journalists left.</p>
<p>The actual problem is the peer is peer review systems, entirely, in my opinion, like the</p>
<p>problem with this study is that this was done by an up and coming researcher in 2006 at the</p>
<p>University of Minnesota, under a researcher who is well known. And so there was zero incentive,</p>
<p>as Friedberg said, to really push back when well credentialed scientists tried to find this</p>
<p>amyloid beta star 56, they couldn&rsquo;t find it. And, you know, lo and behold, those articles don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>published because they don&rsquo;t get accepted. Why? Because it unravels the entire game that folks</p>
<p>will play. So you know, if you&rsquo;re a well educated PhD with postdoc in the right places,</p>
<p>supporting other people, it&rsquo;s just the loop that goes on forever. The article goes on to talk about</p>
<p>how that person who wrote that initial article eventually got this very prestigious multi year</p>
<p>grant from the NIH by a person who was his reviewer who worked on the 2006 paper with him.</p>
<p>I mean, these are some pretty blatant conflicts of interest. But the reason they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>uncovered is like, who is who&rsquo;s going to step in and all of a sudden become the</p>
<p>let me strike an analogy here. You know, there&rsquo;s a seedling of fraud here, obviously,</p>
<p>some guy took some friggin photos and Photoshop them and doctored them or whatever. But we then</p>
<p>tell ourselves stories. And those stories get us access to money, which allows us to pursue more</p>
<p>science, which is meant to forward the market. And then eventually the market gets forwarded so much</p>
<p>and you spend a billion and a half dollars. And it turns out the whole thing doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Just like stock markets, it starts out as a voting machine in the beginning,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a weighing machine over time. The same is true in science, you will have a voting machine</p>
<p>in the beginning where everyone has some belief, some theory, some hypothesis, and they all want</p>
<p>to believe it. And they forward it and they fund it and they fund it. But ultimately, if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true, and it doesn&rsquo;t actually resolve in real world change, the market will collapse, the stock</p>
<p>will collapse. And that&rsquo;s what just happened with amyloid beta and Alzheimer&rsquo;s to a large degree,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a billion and a half dollar market cap, you can think about it, or a billion and a half</p>
<p>dollars of funding that&rsquo;s gone into this. No, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s pretty. No, there was a</p>
<p>billion and a half of NIH funding over time. This is just the NIH money.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is the NIH budget per year for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia is 1.9 billion. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah. And half of it, if you look at the tags, if you just search the tags,</p>
<p>half the money has gone into Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease amyloid beta. So the point is,</p>
<p>you could orient the terms you used and the way in which you wrote your grants to disproportionately</p>
<p>affect the likelihood of getting money. Separately, there&rsquo;s a whole body of researchers</p>
<p>that have felt for a very long time, that specific forms of infection viruses,</p>
<p>Lyme disease could actually be a precursor to Alzheimer&rsquo;s. And it has been poorly researched</p>
<p>because the funding dollars weren&rsquo;t there. So there&rsquo;s a lot of other theory,</p>
<p>dysfunction. Yeah. Yeah. So freeberg, when we look at this, a bad actor, committing fraud,</p>
<p>can send the entire deployment of capital in science on a multi billion dollar trajectory</p>
<p>of the human race. Come on, like, it&rsquo;s not just about like, we didn&rsquo;t get the dollars in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s if you don&rsquo;t take the path, the drug doesn&rsquo;t get discovered. That&rsquo;s a really big deal.</p>
<p>And now that and now the drug is in the market, biogen gets approval, and people start taking it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing the data doesn&rsquo;t work. And no one wants to use it. So the market has collapsed,</p>
<p>and you kind of go back to the origin. It&rsquo;s like the market collapses. Ultimately,</p>
<p>the weighing machine happens, because the science doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>And there was no incentive. No one got paid along the way. Imagine if there was a bounty program</p>
<p>to go and disprove papers. I mean, imagine if there was a system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was talking about. What is the safeguard? And we do have that in public markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called shorting. No, there is short stocks. It&rsquo;s called pub peer. The problem is, if you go</p>
<p>to pub peer, and all of a sudden put your name out there, as someone calling it out,</p>
<p>your professional career inside a research institution is finished.</p>
<p>Right? If your job, they&rsquo;re not heroes. No, if your job is to disprove other people&rsquo;s stuff,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t forward your career, right? I mean, there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a real challenge.</p>
<p>Those people should be heroes. There&rsquo;s those are like bug bounty programs, they have to look at it</p>
<p>like bug bounty programs in tech, or shorting stocks in problem is that this community is</p>
<p>extremely small, highly specialized, and their impacts are enormous on all of society. But you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t replace them with somebody else very easily, because it takes an enormous amount</p>
<p>of expertise. Like if you read that science article, the amount of work science took six</p>
<p>months of due diligence before they even had the courage to put this thing out there. They had</p>
<p>all kinds of different teams trying to prove what this guy had found before they were willing to put</p>
<p>ink to this thing. Yeah, when things are starting to feel like they&rsquo;re altering, moving to market</p>
<p>or getting to market, the more money starts to flow in. Another good example of this is</p>
<p>Zymergen and Ginkgo. Okay, so in the past week, Zymergen was acquired for $300 million. It was</p>
<p>announced that they&rsquo;re going to be acquired by Ginkgo Bioworks, both of whom are public companies</p>
<p>Ginkgo went public, and I think a $20 billion market cap as a SPAC a few months ago, Zymergen</p>
<p>went public at, you know, 4 billion or whatever they went public at Zymergen being acquired for</p>
<p>$300 million comes off of them having raised a total of one and a half billion dollars of capital</p>
<p>from many investors, including SoftBank, and in their IPO, since they were founded in 2013. Both</p>
<p>of these businesses do exactly the same thing or similar things, which is pursue the industrialization</p>
<p>of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology has been talked about, you know, or pursued for 20 years in</p>
<p>an industrial setting, the kind of Gen One of synthetic bio companies was Amaris, Jivo, Kior,</p>
<p>Solazyme. These companies were all engineering cells, you change the genome or the DNA of the</p>
<p>cells, you get those cells to make a product you want them to make, you put them in what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a bioreactor, and they make the product, you can make bioplastics, you can make animal</p>
<p>proteins, you can make fuel. And so these and you put sugar water in the tank. So you&rsquo;re programming</p>
<p>the organism to make stuff for you. And there&rsquo;s a lot of technical challenges, right? How do you</p>
<p>change the genome? How do you get it to be more productive? What are the environmental conditions</p>
<p>of the bioreactor? How do you scale this thing up and so on. And so many of them had early stage</p>
<p>proof points and then extrapolated out that this is going to work at scale. So all the Gen One</p>
<p>companies largely failed Jivo, Kior, Solazyme, they were all trying to compete with the price of oil,</p>
<p>and they lost. And so they could never actually the science worked in the lab. But getting it to</p>
<p>a big scale, there was a million things that went that suddenly were kind of proven or disproven</p>
<p>along the way. And they all kind of pivoted and became cosmetics companies and kind of did high</p>
<p>end food and other stuff. And then Ginkgo and Zymogen were kind of Gen Two, they were like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to reduce the cost improve the timescale of the synthetic biology programs.</p>
<p>And they started using industrial robots and arms. Zymogen made a bunch of kind of strategic errors</p>
<p>where they were like, we&rsquo;re going to make the product and design the organisms. So it took a</p>
<p>lot more money, a lot more time. And as they kind of stepped up and tried to scale up, turns out a</p>
<p>lot of the things that they believe to be true weren&rsquo;t quite true. But the CEO did a great job</p>
<p>selling the story. Josh Hoffman, he went out for years, and he told everyone, you know, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to kind of create this this factory, and we&rsquo;re going to make everything in the world using</p>
<p>biology, it&rsquo;s going to transform the world. And we&rsquo;ve talked about this. Is it a true story?</p>
<p>Yeah. And so look, there&rsquo;s so much of the fundamentals are true. But the industrialization,</p>
<p>the amount of capital these guys raised, and what they promised they would deliver on when</p>
<p>turned out not to quite beat the economics not to quite get there. And the market decisions they</p>
<p>made about what products to go after how quickly to scale up building their own facilities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of strategic errors. And I think the storytelling got ahead</p>
<p>of where the business was, you know, we saw this a lot in other businesses in the past year,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about crypto and other markets. But these were really key examples, because the</p>
<p>science is so compelling. And the narrative is so compelling. And if it&rsquo;s right, and if it works,</p>
<p>it changes the world. And I think the same was true of amyloid beta and Alzheimer&rsquo;s, everyone</p>
<p>wanted it to be true. SSRIs, everyone wants there to be a cure for depression that you take a pill,</p>
<p>and you solve depression, everyone wants to, you know, have a drug that you take,</p>
<p>and it ends Alzheimer&rsquo;s, everyone wants to print all the world&rsquo;s products in a factory using cells.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot more to it. And as you kind of get through the nuanced 10 to 20 year cycle of</p>
<p>science moves to technology moves to industry, those stages are wrought with errors and issues,</p>
<p>and ultimately may not actually yield what we expected it to yield. And those stories start</p>
<p>to fall apart. And that&rsquo;s what happened with dimergen. They&rsquo;re getting bought.</p>
<p>We look back on this Friedberg in 20 years and say, Hey, yeah, these things were total train</p>
<p>wrecks, they flip the car. But it was a step in the right direction. And yeah, that was 100%</p>
<p>capital. But you know, something will be built on top of it, just like mainframes,</p>
<p>or many computers to smartphones, the first system of college synthetic biology, a recombinant DNA,</p>
<p>where we took DNA from one organism, and we put it in a, in a, you know, microbe to make stuff for</p>
<p>us was genetic in 1978. Prior to 1978. The way we got insulin is we actually process pig parts.</p>
<p>So it would take like, you know, hundreds of kilograms of pig parts to make just a few grams</p>
<p>of insulin. And genetic took the DNA for human insulin, and they put it in a bacterial cell,</p>
<p>and they made human insulin in a bioreactor. And that really kind of ushered in this this era of,</p>
<p>you know, industrial synthetic biology that all of these companies kind of followed suit to do</p>
<p>in different markets. But remember, biologics, the entire pharma industry and biologic drugs</p>
<p>is all made this way. We take the DNA to code for certain antibodies or proteins,</p>
<p>we put it in microbes, and those microbes make those products for us. That biologics drug industry</p>
<p>is a $350 billion annual revenue industry today. And so it works. It&rsquo;s just a matter of when and</p>
<p>what the right products are industrial enzymes $25 billion annual revenue today. So there are</p>
<p>markets that are working, it is working, but this whole like, we&rsquo;re going to change the world</p>
<p>overnight isn&rsquo;t really, you know, true. And so these stories catch up to us. And I think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen this where I call it science meets money, you know, money usually wins. And the science isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite there yet. And so we&rsquo;ve seen as a kind of genentech story is amazing. I mean, Tom Perkins</p>
<p>from Kleiner Perkins fame, like will that company into being and they Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing how</p>
<p>in the old days of venture capital, they basically built these companies like you&rsquo;re doing today,</p>
<p>Friedberg in like a production board model, he basically incubated genentech, and then surprised</p>
<p>the world with like, hey, we have synthetic insulin here. It was like, I mean, the Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, there isn&rsquo;t a single material or food, or fuel or product that we ultimately won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to make using synthetic biology. It&rsquo;s just a matter of how do we get from here to there.</p>
<p>And the storytelling kind of gets you a bunch of money, and then you get ahead of your skis,</p>
<p>and then boom, you fall down. Same happened in Alzheimer&rsquo;s, same happened with SSRIs. And I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ll see this happen a lot. But like when science gets exciting, a lot of money gets behind</p>
<p>it. And sometimes it can kind of, you know, get ahead of its skis and fall down. But and it will</p>
<p>result in our sex, how excited are you for this revolution? Instead of biology, actually invested</p>
<p>with us in one of our companies in synthetic biology, he may not remember, but he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>money. I won&rsquo;t name the company, but he&rsquo;s got some money. Oh, yeah. How&rsquo;s that doing?</p>
<p>Yeah. Did you fall asleep in the board meeting?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not on the board. We&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re passive. We didn&rsquo;t is that the one we brought to you</p>
<p>freeberg? Yeah, well, I have three people brought, but I&rsquo;ve known him since they were small. But yeah,</p>
<p>I know there was a deal that came in that looked interesting, but it was a little bit out of our</p>
<p>area. So we went to freeberg with it is an interesting business because these guys provide</p>
<p>a tooling service to other symbiote companies. And so it&rsquo;s a recurring revenue service. Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a picks and shovels. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It was very sass like in that regard.</p>
<p>Like a babushka doll of nerds. Unbelievable. So we&rsquo;ve woken saxes awake. Okay, so we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about an area where, you know, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to contribute a lot to the discussion of</p>
<p>SSRIs. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend to know. I&rsquo;m just a consumer. I&rsquo;m not. Why do I know? I just lied.</p>
<p>Sax had these SSRIs helped you in any way with your depression about Biden? No. Okay.</p>
<p>The story that I think kind of fits with everything we&rsquo;re talking about this week,</p>
<p>is, there was more, there were more stories this week about this cynical ploy by the Democratic</p>
<p>Party to fund candidates. No, hold on. We talked a little bit about this last week, but they spent</p>
<p>you should be really opposed to this J kal. Yeah, listen, as an independent, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gross. I am an independent. You&rsquo;re an independent only votes for Democrats. So</p>
<p>not true. Not true. I&rsquo;m going to vote for Liz Cheney for president. I think Liz Cheney or</p>
<p>Bezos. Those are my two choices. Have you ever voted for a Republican candidate for any office</p>
<p>ever? I had. Yeah, I have. You have really? Yeah. Yeah. People, I, I&rsquo;m a moderate. I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like when I voted for, um, what did I vote for? We&rsquo;re going to say Reagan. We&rsquo;re about to say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re too young. Patrick. He was a Democrat. It&rsquo;s been a long life, but I did. I did vote. I</p>
<p>remember for Republican and when I lived in New York, David Sachs has a look on his face that</p>
<p>says, finish your stupid banter. So I can go on my money. Go, go, go. Hold on. Henry Belcaster in</p>
<p>three, two, go. No, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really have a monologue on it, but I just think that this is,</p>
<p>this is a pretty amazing story that you&rsquo;ve got Democrats spending almost $50 million this primary</p>
<p>season boosting MAGA candidates. Yes. Um, at the expense of moderate GOP candidates. Perfect. And</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get the crazies in there. Yeah. I mean, they&rsquo;re easier to beat, right? And that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>theory. If you get a crazy, but in a, in a year, in a year in which you get a red wave, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>dangerous. And it totally undermines what the Democrats are saying in their January six.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely cynical. I agree. You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t on the one hand backing Trump.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t on the one hand say that we&rsquo;re facing an unprecedented existential crisis for our</p>
<p>democracy. And on the other hand, be giving money to the very same people you&rsquo;re saying are the</p>
<p>threat to democracy. It makes no sense. It just shows that both sides are completely cynical</p>
<p>backing anything that is toxic. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;re saying. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to both, you&rsquo;re trying to both sides that you&rsquo;re trying to both sides. No, but the</p>
<p>difference here is that there, this is, I&rsquo;d say partisan political gamesmanship. But the point is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t on the one hand be engaging in ordinary partisan gamesmanship while you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>democracy faces an unprecedented threat. That&rsquo;s the disconnect. No, no, I guess you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>get too cute. What do you think about Liz Cheney? I&rsquo;m curious. Well, I think for her, if she was a</p>
<p>nominee, she&rsquo;s a warmonger, just like her father. She&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s basically Darth Vader 2.0. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my biggest problem with her is no, I would not, I would not vote for her. There&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a war she doesn&rsquo;t want to get us involved in. And there&rsquo;s not a country she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t try and impose democracy at the end of a barrel. Okay. So that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like her. But</p>
<p>to your point, Democrats say they want to work with more Republicans like Liz Cheney. But if</p>
<p>you look at who they&rsquo;re donating money to, they&rsquo;re donating money to support</p>
<p>the MAGA election denier against every single Republican who voted for impeachment. Okay. So</p>
<p>you look at like the specific races. It&rsquo;s completely cynical. And it&rsquo;s just about winning,</p>
<p>just like the Republicans. To give you one example, Democrats, they gave, they launched $450,000 of</p>
<p>ads to take out a Grand Rapids Congressman Peter Major, who also voted for Trump&rsquo;s impeachment.</p>
<p>They did this with a Democrat, with a Republican in California, David Valadao, and just on and on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got on the one hand, you&rsquo;ve got Democrats saying that this is an unprecedented</p>
<p>threat to democracy. They want to work with more reasonable Republicans who aren&rsquo;t denying</p>
<p>the election, while at the same time, trying to basically fund the campaigns of the MAGA candidate.</p>
<p>Yeah, the reason they&rsquo;re doing it, obviously, is if you fund one of these maniacs,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re easy to beat. So they&rsquo;re trying to serve up somebody who&rsquo;s an easy candidate to</p>
<p>buy. But in a year of strategy, I think it&rsquo;s a very dangerous strategy, because it was my question.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so. Because this year, I think this November is likely to be a wave election.</p>
<p>And when you get a wave election, the specific candidate matters less, and party matters more.</p>
<p>So you could get some of these crazy swept into office. So I think it&rsquo;s a cynical and</p>
<p>counterproductive strategy. And you say that Republicans do it, too. I can&rsquo;t remember any</p>
<p>example. I think Trump itself is like supporting Trump is that I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t remember. I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember a single time ever where Republicans have basically funded, have funded the Soros</p>
<p>candidate. I just think this is very stupid and dangerous. But let me ask you a piece.</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s of a piece. Okay, it&rsquo;s of a piece with the administration claiming we&rsquo;re not in</p>
<p>a recession, trying to redefine recession now that we&rsquo;re in one. It&rsquo;s of a piece with Joe</p>
<p>Manchin all of a sudden calling the slimmed down BBB, the Deficit Reduction Act, after saying that</p>
<p>it would increase the deficit. And the media is not holding these guys accountable. That&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>politicians are going to be as dishonest as the media allows them to be. And the media is not</p>
<p>Conan O&rsquo;Brien kept the White House on as he tweets out. The White House now says it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only a recession if you see a salamander wearing a top hat. Absolutely. The comments are the best</p>
<p>one guys. It&rsquo;s a moment. What about a what about a rabbit pancake? But let me ask you a serious</p>
<p>question, Jake. Jake, I&rsquo;ll seriously going beyond just the specifics of the political issue. I think</p>
<p>we really have a problem with the media class. I mean, the media is carrying water for these</p>
<p>Democrats because they agree with the ideological agenda. We do not have an honest media who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>willing to hold the party in power accountable. Given what you&rsquo;ve said about being disgusted by</p>
<p>like the, you know, denying, you know, this voter fraud conspiracy stuff by Trump or whatever,</p>
<p>if Trump wins the nomination, which I think he will, how are you going to be able to when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the show a year from now, and Trump has the nomination, or, you know, 18 months from now,</p>
<p>whenever it is that he locks it up, and he will lock it up if he runs? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So if he does, though, I don&rsquo;t think conceivably be able to back Trump for a second term,</p>
<p>would you be able to come on this program and say I back Trump as a Republican because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to vote for a Democrat? What would you do just not vote because you don&rsquo;t like Trump? You</p>
<p>said you would not support him. Listen, politics is always a choice of the lesser of two evils</p>
<p>are a lot of so you would vote for Trump. So I hope I&rsquo;m not in that situation. Listen, I</p>
<p>What would you do? Listen, the election that America does not want in 24 is Biden versus</p>
<p>Trump. I think the race that they want, I think the choice they want to make is actually DeSantis</p>
<p>versus Newsom. That&rsquo;s the choice I&rsquo;d like to make. So look, I&rsquo;m on the DeSantis train. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m supporting for 24. You know, if it ends up being something different, we can talk about</p>
<p>Bezos DeSantis, what would you do? Would you vote for DeSantis? You go? Really? Yeah. What about you</p>
<p>Chamath? Would you go Bezos or DeSantis? Who would you vote for? Bezos or DeSantis?</p>
<p>I Bezos or DeSantis? Hmm. Well, that&rsquo;s a tough one. Probably DeSantis.</p>
<p>Okay, Freeberg. Bezos. I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;m gonna sit this question out. Let&rsquo;s keep going. Okay. All</p>
<p>right, everybody. There you have it. Everybody. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a dumb question, J. Cal, because</p>
<p>Bezos is not running. I mean, and honestly, the fact that people were even discussing is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a thought experiment. No, but his thought. But the thought experiment, the reason why I would</p>
<p>go to DeSantis is at least he knows how to play the game of politics. Bezos would just in a matter</p>
<p>of a week be like, why did I do this? I had the best life in the world. Exactly. There&rsquo;s just no</p>
<p>way. It&rsquo;s a stupid idea. He is living his best life. Listen, J. Cal, Bezos had two tweets</p>
<p>criticizing the administration on inflation. And you&rsquo;re like, he&rsquo;s running for president. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running. No, no, no, no. There&rsquo;s two. There&rsquo;s other reasons. Come on. Stop being such a clown.</p>
<p>He bought the Washington Post. He bought the biggest house in D.C.</p>
<p>And he gave that $10 billion climate patch. I think those are all little cards that you could</p>
<p>check boxes. And if he writes a biography, probably has houses all over the world. Doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running for president of those countries. Come on. I&rsquo;m just saying you&rsquo;re just scared. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scared of the basis presidency. You know that he would roll over DeSantis. He would roll DeSantis.</p>
<p>Even if Bezos were dumb enough to run for president, I think he&rsquo;s too smart to do that.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party would never nominate him. That&rsquo;s not why he would pass like some purity</p>
<p>test because of what happened to Bloomberg. I mean, listen, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;d love to</p>
<p>see a candidate like Bloomberg or Bezos nominated by the Democratic Party because they clearly</p>
<p>understand economics. Right. Would it be a masterstroke by the Democratic Party to embrace</p>
<p>a model? I would like to. I would love to see a candidate like that. But look at what happened</p>
<p>to Bloomberg. Bloomberg spent one hundred million dollars. He lasted to the first question of the</p>
<p>first debate. They knocked him out of the first course of the first debate. And then, you know,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren knocked him out by just basically calling a billionaire. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there stunned. He had no answer. Terrible. Yeah, he did. Terrible,</p>
<p>terrible. But I mean, it would be a masterstroke if they went with a moderate. You know it.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, for David Sachs, Chamath and Friedberg, I&rsquo;m Jay Cowell. We&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>next time on Episode 90. Love you. Love you. Love you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
