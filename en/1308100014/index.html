My camel toe prevention, I have been diligent.
Vigilant?
I actually just forgot.
I just lied to you.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about it one time since.
What mystifies me is do you feel it?
No.
Obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel it.
Yeah.
If you could see it and I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it.
What have you had it with this week?
Oh my gosh.

    <p>How&rsquo;s your camel toe prevention going?</p>
<p>My camel toe prevention, I have been diligent.</p>
<p>Vigilant?</p>
<p>I actually just forgot.</p>
<p>I just lied to you.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about it one time since.</p>
<p>What mystifies me is do you feel it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Obviously I didn&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you could see it and I didn&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>This is like, you&rsquo;re going to love this.</p>
<p>Women that baby talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable when adult women baby talk.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I mean like if you&rsquo;re like googly goo with a child or a pet, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking like grown ass women, oh pookie punky bear, will you get me another cocktail?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s bizarro.</p>
<p>Have you not?</p>
<p>No, it is.</p>
<p>If I was at a girl that worked for me a long time ago and she would talk to her husband</p>
<p>like an abnormal amount of times during the day and we&rsquo;d be in the middle of a meeting</p>
<p>and she would be speaking normally, then all of a sudden it would be like, oh hi, yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sending, I&rsquo;m making copies, yeah, and then I&rsquo;m going to send an email and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like why are you talking to him like that?</p>
<p>Why are you talking like that?</p>
<p>You live together, Andy&rsquo;s an adult.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care if they live together.</p>
<p>No one should baby talk as a grown up.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it with baby talk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think that you can get some men, little titty baby men that do some baby</p>
<p>talking.</p>
<p>Like to their wives, like, oh, will you bring me another beer please?</p>
<p>Little titty babies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever encountered a baby talking male.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout though.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I think that if the listeners know of any, I want that DM to us.</p>
<p>We need some data.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Name, age, contact information.</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Instagram handle.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What is Welch?</p>
<p>I have had it up to my eyeballs with mega churches.</p>
<p>Which part?</p>
<p>Right out of the gates, let me just tell you, the architecture is terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it is awful architecture.</p>
<p>Usually kind of more modern-y, trying to go for a modern feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Modern has a, has a feel that like maybe it&rsquo;s, you know, Frank Lloyd Wright or something.</p>
<p>But this architecture of these mega churches is awful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right out of the gates what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can I just have a long list?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But let me just ask you one quick thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How many mega churches have you actually been in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in a couple.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So, you know, I was raised, I was born in Dallas, moved to Oklahoma city when I was</p>
<p>around seven.</p>
<p>And so I went to school in the suburban Oklahoma city area.</p>
<p>And a lot of the kids that I went to school with were big time mega churchers.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t go to church.</p>
<p>My family&rsquo;s not religious.</p>
<p>And I remember when I was like probably in junior high, this girls on my cheerleading</p>
<p>squad are like, have you ever been saved?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, from what?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, have you ever accepted Jesus as your Lord and personal savior?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, you need to, or you&rsquo;re going to go to hell.</p>
<p>So I race home, tell my mother, my mother&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s ridiculous, whatever.</p>
<p>So I go to church, to a mega church with my friend and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re driving.</p>
<p>Her mom worked at UPS.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like a middle-class family, right?</p>
<p>And she had a cup in the car full of coins and then she had a $20 bill on the dashboard.</p>
<p>We went to 7-Eleven and she was like, girls, please put like $5 or $10 of gasoline in the</p>
<p>car.</p>
<p>And we pumped it.</p>
<p>So then I went to get the 20 and she goes, no, you&rsquo;ll need to take the change inside</p>
<p>to pay for it with the change, because the 20 is for the church.</p>
<p>And let me tell you how big this church was.</p>
<p>And this is on my list too.</p>
<p>It was massive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a light show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a dunk tank.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a rock band.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a cheerleading squad.</p>
<p>I had never been, it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>And bad architecture, apparently.</p>
<p>Awful architecture.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my friend whose mom works at UPS, who&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re literally counting dimes</p>
<p>to pay for gasoline, but the church gets the 20.</p>
<p>This preacher lives in this huge mansion, right?</p>
<p>His wife comes waltzing in to the congregation with this mink coat on.</p>
<p>And I immediately knew at 13 that that was a racket.</p>
<p>I immediately knew.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it subsequently busted as a racket?</p>
<p>Well, aren&rsquo;t they all?</p>
<p>I think it was that Joel Olsteen, that some plumber was doing some work at that megachurch</p>
<p>down in Houston, and they found all these envelopes stuffed with cash in the wall.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the same asshole that when they had that big hurricane in Houston, that he wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like let people come shelter in his massive megachurch.</p>
<p>Mind you, he has like two or three PJs.</p>
<p>Private jets.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>If you are that loaded, okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to pay taxes on your church, hire a good</p>
<p>architect.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So have you been in the one that you drive by on Pickleball?</p>
<p>Have you ever been inside?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But then how do you know it&rsquo;s not fabulous inside?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never been in either, so I can&rsquo;t argue it either way.</p>
<p>So are you making that maybe don&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a wild stab at it based on the outside.</p>
<p>I bet it&rsquo;s a disaster on the inside.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s just a dump?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt.</p>
<p>There is no doubt.</p>
<p>It is so&hellip;</p>
<p>The architecture is so bad, and I have had it.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>But I think we have something really fun that we need to share with our listener.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lay it on me.</p>
<p>We have, in addition to Nellie and Jen and Richard, we have a new producer that has joined</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>Who we love.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the best, best, best.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Kylie, say hi to our listeners.</p>
<p>Hello, listeners.</p>
<p>You can tell she&rsquo;s really excited.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think we might be more excited than she is.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, they can&rsquo;t see, but I just peed my pants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how excited.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s joining Jen and Nellie, and she is&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you on the cusp of like Gen Z millennial?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m millennial.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a millennial?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Nellie&rsquo;s a millennial.</p>
<p>You and I are Gen X.</p>
<p>Jen&rsquo;s Gen X.</p>
<p>Richard, what are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a millennial.</p>
<p>How old are you, Richard?</p>
<p>35.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have a Gen Zer.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a Gen Zer.</p>
<p>You know, pumps is on the cusp of&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on the cusp of being a baby boomer.</p>
<p>I am not.</p>
<p>That is a lie.</p>
<p>I am much younger than you.</p>
<p>Four years is not that much younger.</p>
<p>Four years is nothing.</p>
<p>I want to welcome everybody to our podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>AKA Pumps.</p>
<p>Pumps.</p>
<p>And today we are going to talk about something that we have absolutely had it with, and it</p>
<p>is the abstinence-only culture, which we think is a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a recipe for grandchildren too soon.</p>
<p>And born-again virgins.</p>
<p>Once that cherry&rsquo;s popped, it&rsquo;s popped.</p>
<p>No going back.</p>
<p>And purity rings.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been around some purity rings in my day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had one, but I know people that do.</p>
<p>That have purity rings?</p>
<p>Well, that have given them to their kids.</p>
<p>The parents give them to the kids?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think the kids are buying them, do you?</p>
<p>I just think that is so&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an extra layer of guilt, I think.</p>
<p>A total extra layer of guilt, because here&rsquo;s what really gets in my craw about this, okay?</p>
<p>We are genetically hardwired to reproduce.</p>
<p>It is literally in our genes, our DNA as a species.</p>
<p>We eat, we sleep, we screw.</p>
<p>It is in our DNA.</p>
<p>And then you have this part of culture that wants to suppress something that is literally</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re genetically encoded to do, which is to reproduce.</p>
<p>So then you have all this crap that comes out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got porn addicts, shame, men with Madonna complexes.</p>
<p>And you know what they turn out to be?</p>
<p>Three things.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A quick shot.</p>
<p>Quick shot?</p>
<p>A soft serve.</p>
<p>Soft serve.</p>
<p>Or a gyrator.</p>
<p>All three, not good.</p>
<p>None of them are good.</p>
<p>None are good.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s mommy complex or just bad sex?</p>
<p>Probably shouldn&rsquo;t need to do some independent research on what causes soft serve.</p>
<p>Maybe we should bring our guest on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We are so envious of our guests because she has the best job in the world.</p>
<p>She watches television, all types of television, reality scripted and documentaries, true crime.</p>
<p>And then she has a podcast two to three times a week and she has the producers of the podcast</p>
<p>on, the directors.</p>
<p>She gets to the deep dark bottom of it.</p>
<p>She also is a contributor at Us Weekly.</p>
<p>And so without further ado, let&rsquo;s welcome our guest, the host of Reality Life with Kate</p>
<p>Casey.</p>
<p>Kate Casey.</p>
<p>Hi, Kate.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>The habit that is firing you guys up this week, what is it?</p>
<p>So the born again virgins, the purity rings and the abstinence only concept, which I think</p>
<p>is just a recipe for complete failure.</p>
<p>And five kids.</p>
<p>Well, clearly I&rsquo;m not doing the purity thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird controlling fathers that perpetuate this myth that you&rsquo;re going to have everlasting</p>
<p>happiness if you wait until you get married, which might work for some, but a very small</p>
<p>percentage of the world.</p>
<p>And this whole idea of like giving them a ring and you&rsquo;re like married to your dad is</p>
<p>super creepy and weird.</p>
<p>And then all the celebrities that have over the years partaked in this, like the Jonas</p>
<p>brothers, they did this whole like purity.</p>
<p>You know that they&rsquo;re just mortified about that now.</p>
<p>And then I remember Jessica Simpson, when she was engaged to Nick Lachey, when she was</p>
<p>on the newlyweds, the whole story was she&rsquo;s saving herself to marriage, which gross about</p>
<p>that is that she had this big celebrity wedding.</p>
<p>And you can just imagine all the people that were like, well, she&rsquo;s going to do it tonight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody should know you&rsquo;re about to do it for the first time.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>And plus it&rsquo;s like buying a car.</p>
<p>Would you buy a car without test driving it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would you marry someone that you hadn&rsquo;t had sex with?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re terrible?</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re a quick shot, a gyrator, all the many pitfalls of bad sex?</p>
<p>Well, one thing that I think we need to talk about, and I know you&rsquo;ve covered this on your</p>
<p>podcast and it is the abstinence only culture at Liberty University.</p>
<p>And as everybody knows, Jerry Falwell Jr. was the president of Liberty University.</p>
<p>And these students, they, let me read to you guys some of the rules.</p>
<p>No sex, no kissing, three second maximum on hugs.</p>
<p>They charge, they charge any student who spends the night with the opposite sex with 30 reprimands.</p>
<p>Even couples who are not talking or touching can be reprimanded for quote, optical intercourse.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Or making eye babies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s written down somewhere in their bylaws or something.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, Jerry Falwell Jr. had optical intercourse when he watched his wife get plowed</p>
<p>by the pool boy.</p>
<p>Repeatedly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like he liked to watch.</p>
<p>It was kind of creepy, that documentary.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So Kate, why don&rsquo;t you tell us, I know that you covered that on your podcast, but did</p>
<p>you find out any juicy scoop about that?</p>
<p>Yes, because I interviewed the director, Billy Corpin, who&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious and one</p>
<p>to follow on social media.</p>
<p>He got an incoming email, he and his partner from Juan Carlo, who was the pool boy, who</p>
<p>said, I&rsquo;m ready to tell my story.</p>
<p>So they set out to tell this crazy story.</p>
<p>And it is absolutely frustrating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hypocrisy personified.</p>
<p>And yeah, he was president of the school.</p>
<p>He was absolutely a drinker.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not allowed to drink.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not allowed to have sex.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a complete alcoholic.</p>
<p>They were so controlling over the population, the students, telling them how to behave,</p>
<p>especially when it came to sexuality.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, they&rsquo;re having this very strange relationship with a young pool boy in Miami.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>But it also reminds me of all the people I knew who went to super religious schools.</p>
<p>Like there was this one in Pennsylvania called Messiah College.</p>
<p>And they had this weird rule that if you had somebody in your room, the door always had</p>
<p>to be open, like to a certain degree.</p>
<p>And there had to be lights on and one foot on the floor at all times, as if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bone somebody with one foot on the floor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just making different sexual positions.</p>
<p>Thomas, why don&rsquo;t you tell Kate about your own personal research on young Mormon sex?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jennifer didn&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>She thought I was lying when I told her this.</p>
<p>There is a thing that the Mormons do called soaking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the male puts his penis in the vagina, but they don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>They just soak.</p>
<p>And then if they get it on a bunk bed, they get on the top and the person at the bunk</p>
<p>underneath starts moving the bed.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s friction there, but technically they&rsquo;re not having sex because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thrusting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called soaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I Googled it.</p>
<p>It is real.</p>
<p>And they actually do have the other person in the room that shakes the bed.</p>
<p>And Kylie and I found some stuff on TikTok about it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like the Mormon fluffer that fluffs the bed, which I think is far more kinky and</p>
<p>far more egregious than Sally and Willie that have been dating for a year and just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep their hands off of each other and try to decide to take it over the finish line.</p>
<p>So these Mormon teens, and some of them are even having butt sex, which I think is far</p>
<p>more egregious.</p>
<p>Far worse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I almost think they&rsquo;re not telling the truth because they know my reaction is so horrified,</p>
<p>but that like younger girls are preferring just to have ass sex so they can have, be</p>
<p>technically a virgin.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this on the purity rings.</p>
<p>If you have the purity ring, is it just vaginal intercourse?</p>
<p>Or is there like a-</p>
<p>Or does your daddy talk to you about other stuff that, or are you not supposed to do</p>
<p>anything?</p>
<p>Oh, I would imagine that you can&rsquo;t do anything, but I think that like the soaking situation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a loophole that you can kind of get around.</p>
<p>So listen to this, Jen Morton, our producer, was telling me, she&rsquo;s heard of this called</p>
<p>a hymenoplasty, okay?</p>
<p>So they laser the vagine.</p>
<p>So somebody like from the Middle East or somebody here who wants to be a born again virgin,</p>
<p>they laser the vagine back.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve already had sex, your hymen&rsquo;s broken, but you don&rsquo;t want anybody to know.</p>
<p>So you go to the vagine doctor, you get the vagine kind of lasered together so that on</p>
<p>your wedding night, penis enters, blood flows, everybody thinks you&rsquo;re a virgin.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a real surgery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>Hymenoplasty.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it true that like 50% of the people that don&rsquo;t have sex don&rsquo;t have a hymen?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s 100% of the time.</p>
<p>You can lose it exercising.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million ways.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you just say, I broke it exercising, or I don&rsquo;t know, a tampon.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a big deal in Middle Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>I mean, like they go to look to make sure that there is blood on the sheets.</p>
<p>So I mean-</p>
<p>Who goes and looks?</p>
<p>The people, the family.</p>
<p>The family?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just imagining my own weird parents partaking of this.</p>
<p>They would be such weirdos about it.</p>
<p>And this is already a weird situation.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s move on to, I want to talk about celebrities that are born again virgins.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s a born again virgin?</p>
<p>So it means you&rsquo;ve already had sex with other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like reinventing history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reinventing history to accommodate the life plan that you decided that you wanted</p>
<p>to have after you made the mistake of having sex already.</p>
<p>One could call it revisionist history.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So me and I looked up the definition on Urban Dictionary for born again virgin, and it is</p>
<p>somebody who has not had sex in over a year, which I think might qualify you, Pumps.</p>
<p>Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, hold on.</p>
<p>I do, on this topic of the born again virgin, that&rsquo;s why I wanted to know, I&rsquo;ve had an experience</p>
<p>with a parent that told me that they prayed her daughter&rsquo;s virginity back.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, she said it.</p>
<p>Out loud.</p>
<p>Out loud to other people.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Daughter, pops cherry.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Has sex.</p>
<p>Premarital.</p>
<p>Mom and dad madder than a hornet.</p>
<p>So upset.</p>
<p>Dropped to their knees.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Restore virginity.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And then she said that to you out loud.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She did not say it to me, but she said it to several people that reported it to me,</p>
<p>trustee sources, people that would not make this shit up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, there was no self-awareness that that sounded crazy.</p>
<p>First of all, why aren&rsquo;t you talking about your daughter&rsquo;s sex habits?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with the abstinence only stuff.</p>
<p>Other than children?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Other than children is number, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s deep psychological issues, residue</p>
<p>from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t have sex.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have sex.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have sex.</p>
<p>You have to keep yourself clean.</p>
<p>You have to keep yourself pure.</p>
<p>Well then little Sally starts dating little Willie and let&rsquo;s hope for little Sally&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s big Willie.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, they&rsquo;ve been dating for a year or two and they&rsquo;re 19, 20 and of course</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to want to screw.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Of course they are.</p>
<p>But then she does and then she feels dirty and then you have this lifetime of shame.</p>
<p>And I think the data shows that people, abstinence only education where you don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>use contraceptions, yes, you&rsquo;re going to have more unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have more STDs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be wrapping it before you tap it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just a lot of problems with not teaching kids how to have sex.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re going to have it.</p>
<p>These parents being so involved in it, that creeps me out.</p>
<p>Have the conversations where you&rsquo;re like, this is what sex means.</p>
<p>This is what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>This is why you want to save yourself for as long as you can and be with the right person.</p>
<p>But being that much involved is super creepy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Especially with the purity rings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really creepy.</p>
<p>I mean, with my kids, I have a son that&rsquo;s 20 and it&rsquo;s just like as a mother to a male,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you are responsible for where you deposit that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put it on her.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think that for women, sex is a little bit more emotional.</p>
<p>It feels differently.</p>
<p>It has a different take on it.</p>
<p>And always go at a woman&rsquo;s pace, but be vigilant in protecting her from pregnancy.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s just not my business.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think you have-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t like about the ring too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like inserting yourself literally into a conversation that is absolutely none of</p>
<p>your business.</p>
<p>But I want to go back to this.</p>
<p>The dad gives it to the daughter?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He gives her a ring and it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re making a promise to me that you will save</p>
<p>yourself until marriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s marrying her dad in a way.</p>
<p>And I think mothers give them too.</p>
<p>But also I read that men, some boys, they give them to boys too, which I think always</p>
<p>it falls on the female.</p>
<p>But a guy with a purity ring, that to me just screams gay.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s like, why are you inserting as a parent your control over your child&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sexuality?</p>
<p>They need to explore that and figure that out on their own, whether they&rsquo;re gay, straight,</p>
<p>bisexual, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about them and their own experience.</p>
<p>Much like I don&rsquo;t want anybody to insert themselves in a conversation about what I do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It is no one&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>But I do, I mean, I&rsquo;ve even been in situations where other mothers are talking about the</p>
<p>sex lives of kids that aren&rsquo;t even theirs, like speculating as to who these high school</p>
<p>kids are sleeping with.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that right there tells me you are horrendous.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not even a good person.</p>
<p>Like why do you give a shit?</p>
<p>Grown adults that are consumed with teenagers who are pumping with hormones, who are consumed</p>
<p>with their sex lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more than I can take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than I can take.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>But what I do want to talk about with you, Kate, because you are the pop culture expert</p>
<p>with all of this reality TV you watch, I want to talk about some celebrities who have taken</p>
<p>the purity pledge or the pledge to be born again virgins.</p>
<p>So one of the Jonas Brothers, he said, his name was Kevin Jonas.</p>
<p>He waited until marriage to have sex.</p>
<p>And then after he had sex, he said, sex wasn&rsquo;t really worth the wait.</p>
<p>That sounds like a very bad endorsement of his sex skills.</p>
<p>He meets this girl on like a Disney vacation, I think it was like a cruise.</p>
<p>His family, her family, same cruise ship.</p>
<p>And they kept in touch and they got married really young.</p>
<p>So this whole idea of like, well, we were saving ourselves for marriage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you didn&rsquo;t even save yourself for college.</p>
<p>You just like, it&rsquo;s not like you were waiting that long.</p>
<p>I do know in Oklahoma, like when people get married, like when you hear of like a 19 or</p>
<p>20 year old getting married, I always am like, oh my God, they&rsquo;re getting married to have</p>
<p>sex.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Sounds like the Jonas deal.</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m like, you don&rsquo;t have to get married to have sex.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t marry the first Tom, Dick and Harry that you want to have sex with.</p>
<p>Do you remember, y&rsquo;all remember when Sarah Palin was the vice presidential, how could</p>
<p>you forget?</p>
<p>When she was the vice presidential candidate and she had those five kids like Trigg and</p>
<p>Leaf and Branch and Grass, you remember all those kids.</p>
<p>And so she was all about abstinence only education, right?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, her kids all start getting knocked up.</p>
<p>I mean, every single one of them.</p>
<p>And then those Duggars, you know, that&rsquo;s a whole nother thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I mean, look at how that turns out.</p>
<p>You got 95.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another, that&rsquo;s another dad who had inserted himself in his child&rsquo;s sexuality.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it was so controlling to the point where you&rsquo;re going to go on your first date and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tagging along.</p>
<p>Like why are you involved in their dating and their sexuality?</p>
<p>Then you think about anybody in one of these families that is not straight, what that must</p>
<p>feel like for them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the pressure of like, I want to be out and be who I really am.</p>
<p>And I have the added pressure of a parent that like is wedging me into a sexuality that</p>
<p>I, that does not fit for me.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re tagging along and telling me what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the too much control.</p>
<p>It just, it&rsquo;s so upsetting.</p>
<p>How is somebody supposed to have like an interpersonal intimate relationship with someone they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to see outside of being with their parents?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess they could have optical intercourse.</p>
<p>Optical intercourse.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Eye babies is like, I got to remember that one.</p>
<p>Eye babies.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon dated.</p>
<p>So they decided that they were going to abstain until marriage.</p>
<p>And then now he has 12 children with six different women.</p>
<p>So this is anecdotal evidence nonetheless, but anecdotal evidence that this born again</p>
<p>virgin bullshit is just that.</p>
<p>It is such bullshit because here&rsquo;s my thing too.</p>
<p>So you popped your cherry, you&rsquo;ve done it, you&rsquo;ve had sex.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trucking along your 30 something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean like that Christmas song alone, can you imagine what the interest on that thing</p>
<p>is?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>$7 million a year I&rsquo;ve lifted up.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>Mariah Carey, I mean, she&rsquo;s sexy.</p>
<p>She can&hellip;</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Why on earth, if you&rsquo;re in a relationship with somebody as a grown ass woman, are you</p>
<p>not screwing them?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, like we only, and especially at the beginning, like that&rsquo;s the best sex</p>
<p>there is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best sex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then you postpone it and then you&rsquo;ve got Nick Cannon, the two pump chump.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and you know, I mean, no wonder this, you know, Kevin Jonas said it wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>great.</p>
<p>You know, it was like horrible.</p>
<p>The soak, the quick shot and it was over.</p>
<p>And he was like, he probably didn&rsquo;t learn to enjoy sex until much later.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully he did learn.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>On the job training, it sounds like though.</p>
<p>So Kate, you know, I always think when somebody has a lot of kids, I think, why on earth do</p>
<p>they have so many kids?</p>
<p>And you have five.</p>
<p>Because my first instinct is always like a recoil.</p>
<p>Do you get that to people?</p>
<p>People ask me if I&rsquo;m Mormon or Catholic.</p>
<p>I tell them I&rsquo;m an Episcopalian baby hoarder.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the big secret of the world.</p>
<p>Having a lot of kids means I do less work because they all play together.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The older ones babysit.</p>
<p>They do work for me.</p>
<p>And also no one asked me to do anything because they think I&rsquo;m too busy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never helped out at the school to show up, drop off and leave it like, oh, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too busy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re damn right.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because when I have the babies, I like love labor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a normal person.</p>
<p>I show up to the hospital.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s up, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>You love labor.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>I have the last baby.</p>
<p>I had a sign in the back that said, pray for my vagina.</p>
<p>And then I had 10 friends in the room and all the nurses come in and they&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much downtime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>Do you have an epidural?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>And my friends bring in champagne.</p>
<p>Somebody brings in food.</p>
<p>We just laugh the whole time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably the first person I&rsquo;ve ever met that likes labor.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t say like.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>Loves.</p>
<p>Loves.</p>
<p>Loves.</p>
<p>Loves labor.</p>
<p>Well, Kate, I cannot thank you enough.</p>
<p>Aloha.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Ohana.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>Maybe Lilo and Stitch.</p>
<p>Ohana.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Means family.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Have so much fun.</p>
<p>Have a great vacation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Is she not great?</p>
<p>What about the loving giving birth?</p>
<p>Never heard that ever in my entire life.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve got to like circle back around.</p>
<p>Well, but what about a, what are they called?</p>
<p>What is Kim?</p>
<p>What are they called?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Surrogate.</p>
<p>Surrogates.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Remember you had kind of toyed with.</p>
<p>You said that you wouldn&rsquo;t mind being a surrogate.</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I should have kept my uterus.</p>
<p>I should have kept my person&rsquo;s surrogate because I was a great pregnant person, had no problems.</p>
<p>I should have done that.</p>
<p>I would have been good at it because I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to take the baby home.</p>
<p>What if it was your egg?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d care.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d just give that egg up?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s kid, would they?</p>
<p>No, your egg.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But I mean like if it was like we decided beforehand like they were going to use my</p>
<p>egg.</p>
<p>Like a gay friend&rsquo;s sperm.</p>
<p>A gay friend&rsquo;s sperm.</p>
<p>I would not care.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to see what that baby was doing?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Assuming I had my three kids.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be good with that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Would you not?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would feel very possessive about my offspring.</p>
<p>You would?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn&rsquo;t Josh&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>If you did it knowing going in you were going to give it to somebody else?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>If it was mine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoever the male&rsquo;s was wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s my egg, I carried it to term.</p>
<p>I would want that baby.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think I would.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d just give that baby?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would have to be somebody that I really thought would be a good parent that would</p>
<p>love the baby and be devoted to the baby.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t just like sell it on eBay or anything.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I mean, I would make sure I knew the people, but I could detach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast where we sell babies on eBay.</p>
<p>On eBay.</p>
<p>Follow us at I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast on Instagram, Tik Tok.</p>
<p>The really important thing, we want you to send a voice memo to at I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast</p>
<p>on Instagram.</p>
<p>So follow us, go to message, and then you&rsquo;ll see a little microphone at the bottom and</p>
<p>you push the microphone down and send us what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>And then Pumps is going to read that out loud on a bonus content episode and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go off on this topic and see if we agree, disagree.</p>
<p>What do you think about that Pumps?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>But you know, we did a whole episode on how I hated voice memos.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re telling people to do them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But see, we kind of gaslight our audience.</p>
<p>We say this is a podcast about positivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it is a podcast about positivity.</p>
<p>We hate voice memos.</p>
<p>Send us a voice memo.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Tell the people when we&rsquo;re going to see them.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday, everyone.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
