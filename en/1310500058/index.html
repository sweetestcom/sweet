    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Stevens,</p>
<p>the creator of Vsauce,</p>
<p>one of the most popular educational YouTube channels</p>
<p>in the world with over 15 million subscribers</p>
<p>and over 1.7 billion views.</p>
<p>His videos often ask and answer questions</p>
<p>that are both profound and entertaining,</p>
<p>spanning topics from physics to psychology.</p>
<p>Popular questions include,</p>
<p>what if everyone jumped at once?</p>
<p>Or what if the sun disappeared?</p>
<p>Or why are things creepy?</p>
<p>Or what if the earth stopped spinning?</p>
<p>As part of his channel,</p>
<p>he created three seasons of Mind Field,</p>
<p>a series that explored human behavior.</p>
<p>His curiosity and passion are contagious</p>
<p>and inspiring to millions of people.</p>
<p>And so as an educator,</p>
<p>his impact and contribution to the world</p>
<p>is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter,</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads</p>
<p>at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called First,</p>
<p>best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,</p>
<p>and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>which again is an organization</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Stevens.</p>
<p>One of your deeper interests is psychology,</p>
<p>understanding human behavior.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve pointed out how messy studying human behavior is</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s far from the scientific rigor</p>
<p>of something like physics, for example.</p>
<p>How do you think we can take psychology</p>
<p>from where it&rsquo;s been in the 20th century</p>
<p>to something more like what the physicists,</p>
<p>theoretical physicists are doing,</p>
<p>something precise, something rigorous?</p>
<p>Well, we could do it by finding</p>
<p>the physical foundations of psychology, right?</p>
<p>If all of our emotions and moods and feelings and behaviors</p>
<p>are the result of mechanical behaviors of atoms</p>
<p>and molecules in our brains,</p>
<p>then can we find correlations?</p>
<p>Perhaps like chaos makes that really difficult</p>
<p>and the uncertainty principle and all these things.</p>
<p>That we can&rsquo;t know the position and velocity</p>
<p>of every single quantum state in a brain, probably.</p>
<p>But I think that if we can get to that point with psychology,</p>
<p>then we can start to think about consciousness</p>
<p>in a physical and mathematical way.</p>
<p>When we ask questions like, well, what is self reference?</p>
<p>How can you think about yourself thinking?</p>
<p>What are some mathematical structures</p>
<p>that could bring that about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ideas of, in terms of consciousness</p>
<p>and breaking it down into physics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ideas of panpsychism where people believe</p>
<p>that whatever consciousness is,</p>
<p>is a fundamental part of reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a physics law.</p>
<p>Do you think, what&rsquo;s your views on consciousness?</p>
<p>Do you think it has this deep part of reality</p>
<p>or is it something that&rsquo;s deeply human</p>
<p>and constructed by us humans?</p>
<p>Starting nice and light and easy.</p>
<p>Nothing I ask you today has actually proven answer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just hypothesizing.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I should clarify, this is all speculation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these topics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not God, but I think that consciousness</p>
<p>is probably something that can be fully explained</p>
<p>within the laws of physics.</p>
<p>I think that our bodies and brains and the universe</p>
<p>and at the quantum level is so rich and complex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised if we couldn&rsquo;t find a room</p>
<p>for consciousness there.</p>
<p>And why should we be conscious?</p>
<p>Why are we aware of ourselves?</p>
<p>That is a very strange and interesting</p>
<p>and important question.</p>
<p>And I think for the next few thousand years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to believe in answers purely on faith.</p>
<p>But my guess is that we will find that,</p>
<p>within the configuration space</p>
<p>of possible arrangements of the universe,</p>
<p>there are some that contain memories of others.</p>
<p>Literally, Julian Barber calls them time capsule states</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, yeah, not only do I have a scratch</p>
<p>on my arm, but also this state of the universe</p>
<p>also contains a memory in my head</p>
<p>of being scratched by my cat three days ago.</p>
<p>And for some reason, those kinds of states of the universe</p>
<p>are more plentiful or more likely.</p>
<p>When you say those states,</p>
<p>the ones that contain memories of its past</p>
<p>or ones that contain memories of its past</p>
<p>and have degrees of consciousness.</p>
<p>Just the first part, because I think the consciousness</p>
<p>then emerges from the fact that a state of the universe</p>
<p>that contains fragments or memories of other states</p>
<p>is one where you&rsquo;re going to feel like there&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like, yeah,</p>
<p>things happened in the past.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll happen in the future</p>
<p>because these states don&rsquo;t contain information</p>
<p>about the future.</p>
<p>For some reason, those kinds of states</p>
<p>are either more common, more plentiful,</p>
<p>or you could use the anthropic principle and just say,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re extremely rare,</p>
<p>but until you are in one, or if you are in one,</p>
<p>then you can ask questions,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re asking me on this podcast.</p>
<p>Why questions?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, why are we conscious?</p>
<p>Well, because if we weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be asking why we were.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of implied that you have a sense,</p>
<p>again, hypothesis, theorizing</p>
<p>that the universe is deterministic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts about free will?</p>
<p>Do you think of the universe as deterministic</p>
<p>in a sense that it&rsquo;s unrolling a particular,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating under a specific set of physical laws.</p>
<p>And when you have to set the initial conditions,</p>
<p>it will unroll in the exact same way</p>
<p>in our particular line of the universe every time.</p>
<p>That is a very useful way to think about the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done us well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brought us to the moon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brought us to where we are today, right?</p>
<p>I would not say that I believe in determinism</p>
<p>in that kind of an absolute form,</p>
<p>or actually I just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna live my life like it is.</p>
<p>What in your sense,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve studied kind of how we humans</p>
<p>think of the world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in your view is the difference between our perception,</p>
<p>like how we think the world is and reality.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a huge gap there?</p>
<p>Like we delude ourselves that the whole thing is an illusion.</p>
<p>Just everything about human psychology,</p>
<p>the way we see things and how things actually are.</p>
<p>All the things you&rsquo;ve studied, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>How big is the gap between reality and perception?</p>
<p>Well, again, purely speculative.</p>
<p>I think that we will never know the answer.</p>
<p>We cannot know the answer.</p>
<p>There is no experiment to find an answer to that question.</p>
<p>Everything we experience is an event in our brain.</p>
<p>When I look at a cat, I&rsquo;m not even,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove that there&rsquo;s a cat there.</p>
<p>All I am experiencing is the perception of a cat</p>
<p>inside my own brain.</p>
<p>I am only a witness to the events of my mind.</p>
<p>I think it is very useful to infer that</p>
<p>if I witness the event of cat in my head,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m looking at a cat that is literally there</p>
<p>and it has its own feelings and motivations</p>
<p>and should be pet and given food and water and love.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way you should live your life.</p>
<p>But whether or not we live in a simulation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a brain in a vat, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you care?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>Well, I care because it&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to get people excited about</p>
<p>all kinds of topics, physics, psychology,</p>
<p>consciousness, philosophy.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, what would the difference be?</p>
<p>If you&hellip;</p>
<p>The cat needs to be fed at the end of the day,</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;ll be a dead cat.</p>
<p>Right, but if it&rsquo;s not even a real cat,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just like a video game cat.</p>
<p>And right, so what&rsquo;s the difference between killing</p>
<p>a digital cat in a video game because of neglect</p>
<p>versus a real cat?</p>
<p>It seems very different to us psychologically.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t really feel bad about, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi, right?</p>
<p>But I would feel terrible</p>
<p>if I forgot to feed my actual cats.</p>
<p>So can you just touch on the topic of simulation?</p>
<p>Do you find this thought experiment that we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>in a simulation useful, inspiring or constructive</p>
<p>in any kind of way?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s ridiculous?</p>
<p>Do you think it could be true?</p>
<p>Or is it just a useful thought experiment?</p>
<p>I think it is extremely useful as a thought experiment</p>
<p>because it makes sense to everyone,</p>
<p>especially as we see virtual reality</p>
<p>and computer games getting more and more complex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking to an audience in like Newton&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, imagine a clock</p>
<p>that it has mechanics in it that are so complex</p>
<p>that it can create love.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>But today you really start to feel, man,</p>
<p>at what point is this little robot friend of mine</p>
<p>gonna be like someone I don&rsquo;t want to cancel plans with?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a great, the thought experiment</p>
<p>of do we live in a simulation?</p>
<p>Am I a brain in a vat that is just being given</p>
<p>electrical impulses from some nefarious other beings</p>
<p>so that I believe that I live on earth</p>
<p>and that I have a body and all of this?</p>
<p>And the fact that you can&rsquo;t prove it either way</p>
<p>is a fantastic way to introduce people</p>
<p>to some of the deepest questions.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a little buddy</p>
<p>that you would want to cancel an appointment with.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of our conversations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my research is, is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And I apologize, but you&rsquo;re such a fun person</p>
<p>to ask these big questions with.</p>
<p>Well, I hope I can give some answers that are interesting.</p>
<p>Well, because of you&rsquo;ve sharpened your brain&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to explore some of the most, some of the questions</p>
<p>that many scientists are actually afraid of even touching,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re in that sense ultimately a great scientist</p>
<p>through this process of sharpening your brain.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if I am a scientist.</p>
<p>I think science is a way of knowing</p>
<p>and there are a lot of questions I investigate</p>
<p>that are not scientific questions.</p>
<p>On like mind field, we have definitely done</p>
<p>scientific experiments and studies that had hypotheses</p>
<p>and all of that, but not to be too like precious</p>
<p>about what does the word science mean?</p>
<p>But I think I would just describe myself as curious</p>
<p>and I hope that that curiosity is contagious.</p>
<p>So to you, the scientific method</p>
<p>is deeply connected to science</p>
<p>because your curiosity took you to asking questions.</p>
<p>To me, asking a good question, even if you feel,</p>
<p>society feels that it&rsquo;s not a question</p>
<p>within the reach of science currently.</p>
<p>To me, asking the question is the biggest step</p>
<p>of the scientific process.</p>
<p>The scientific method is the second part</p>
<p>and that may be what traditionally is called science,</p>
<p>but to me, asking the questions,</p>
<p>being brave enough to ask the questions,</p>
<p>being curious and not constrained</p>
<p>by what you&rsquo;re supposed to think is just true,</p>
<p>what it means to be a scientist to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a huge part of what it means to be a human.</p>
<p>If I were to say, you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in forces.</p>
<p>I think that when I push on a massive object,</p>
<p>a ghost leaves my body and enters the object I&rsquo;m pushing</p>
<p>and these ghosts happen to just get really lazy</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re around massive things</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why F equals MA.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, the laziness of the ghost</p>
<p>is in proportion to the mass of the object.</p>
<p>So boom, prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Every experiment, well, you can never find the ghost.</p>
<p>And so none of that theory is scientific,</p>
<p>but once I start saying, can I see the ghost?</p>
<p>Why should there be a ghost?</p>
<p>And if there aren&rsquo;t ghosts, what might I expect?</p>
<p>And I start to do different tests to see,</p>
<p>is this falsifiable?</p>
<p>Are there things that should happen if there are ghosts</p>
<p>or are there things that shouldn&rsquo;t happen?</p>
<p>And do they, you know, what do I observe?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m thinking scientifically.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of science as, wow, a picture of a black hole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a photograph.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an image.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sensory and perception experience.</p>
<p>Science is how we got that and how we understand it</p>
<p>and how we believe in it</p>
<p>and how we reduce our uncertainty around what it means.</p>
<p>But I would say I&rsquo;m deeply within the scientific community</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sometimes disheartened by the elitism</p>
<p>of the thinking, sort of not allowing yourself</p>
<p>to think outside the box.</p>
<p>So allowing the possibility</p>
<p>of going against the conventions of science,</p>
<p>I think is a beautiful part of some</p>
<p>of the greatest scientists in history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m impressed by scientists every day</p>
<p>and revolutions in our knowledge of the world occur</p>
<p>only under very special circumstances.</p>
<p>It is very scary to challenge conventional thinking</p>
<p>and risky because let&rsquo;s go back to elitism and ego, right?</p>
<p>If you just say, you know what?</p>
<p>I believe in the spirits of my body</p>
<p>and all forces are actually created by invisible creatures</p>
<p>that transfer themselves between objects.</p>
<p>If you ridicule every other theory</p>
<p>and say that you&rsquo;re correct,</p>
<p>then ego gets involved and you just don&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>But fundamentally the question of well, what is a force</p>
<p>is incredibly important.</p>
<p>We need to have that conversation,</p>
<p>but it needs to be done in this very political way</p>
<p>of like, let&rsquo;s be respectful of everyone</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s realize that we&rsquo;re all learning together</p>
<p>and not shutting out other people.</p>
<p>And so when you look at a lot of revolutionary ideas,</p>
<p>they were not accepted right away.</p>
<p>And, you know, Galileo had a couple of problems</p>
<p>with the authorities and later thinkers, Descartes,</p>
<p>was like, all right, look, I kind of agree with Galileo,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna have to not say that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to create and invent and write different things</p>
<p>that keep me from being in trouble,</p>
<p>but we still slowly made progress.</p>
<p>Revolutions are difficult in all forms</p>
<p>and certainly in science.</p>
<p>Before we get to AI, on topic of revolutionary ideas,</p>
<p>let me ask on a Reddit AMA, you said that is the earth flat</p>
<p>is one of the favorite questions you&rsquo;ve ever answered,</p>
<p>speaking of revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>So your video on that, people should definitely watch,</p>
<p>is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate why you enjoyed</p>
<p>answering this question so much?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s a long story.</p>
<p>I remember a long time ago,</p>
<p>I was living in New York at the time,</p>
<p>so it had to have been like 2009 or something.</p>
<p>I visited the Flat Earth forums</p>
<p>and this was before the Flat Earth theories</p>
<p>became as sort of mainstream as they are.</p>
<p>Sorry to ask the dumb question, forums, online forums.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Flat Earth Society,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s.com or.org, but I went there</p>
<p>and I was reading their ideas</p>
<p>and how they responded to typical criticisms of,</p>
<p>well, the earth isn&rsquo;t flat because what about this?</p>
<p>And I could not tell, and I mentioned this in my video,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell how many of these community members</p>
<p>actually believe the earth was flat or we&rsquo;re just trolling.</p>
<p>And I realized that the fascinating thing is,</p>
<p>how do we know anything?</p>
<p>And what makes for a good belief</p>
<p>versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what my video</p>
<p>about earth being flat is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, look, there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>that the earth is probably not flat,</p>
<p>but a Flat Earth believer can respond</p>
<p>to every single one of them, but it&rsquo;s all in an ad hoc way.</p>
<p>And all of these, all of their rebuttals</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily gonna form</p>
<p>a cohesive noncontradictory whole.</p>
<p>And I believe that&rsquo;s the episode</p>
<p>where I talk about Occam&rsquo;s razor</p>
<p>and Newton&rsquo;s flaming laser sword.</p>
<p>And then I say, well, you know what, wait a second.</p>
<p>We know that space contracts as you move.</p>
<p>And so to a particle moving near the speed of light</p>
<p>towards earth, earth would be flattened</p>
<p>in the direction of that particles travel.</p>
<p>So to them, earth is flat.</p>
<p>Like we need to be really generous to even wild ideas</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all thinking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all the communication of ideas.</p>
<p>And what else can it mean to be a human?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think I&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>of the Flat Earth theory, quote unquote,</p>
<p>in the sense that to me it feels harmless</p>
<p>to explore some of the questions</p>
<p>of what it means to believe something,</p>
<p>what it means to explore the edge of science and so on.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s a harm, it&rsquo;s a, to me,</p>
<p>nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat or round,</p>
<p>not literally, but I mean intellectually</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re just having a conversation.</p>
<p>That said, again, to elitism,</p>
<p>I find that scientists roll their eyes</p>
<p>way too fast on the Flat Earth.</p>
<p>The kind of dismissal that I see to this even notion,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t like sat down and say,</p>
<p>what are the arguments that are being proposed?</p>
<p>And this is why these arguments are incorrect.</p>
<p>So that should be something</p>
<p>that scientists should always do,</p>
<p>even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous.</p>
<p>So I like this as almost, it&rsquo;s almost my test</p>
<p>when I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory,</p>
<p>to see how quickly they roll their eyes.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, let me go on record</p>
<p>and say that the earth is not flat.</p>
<p>It is a three dimensional spheroid.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t know that and it has not been proven.</p>
<p>Science doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.</p>
<p>It just reduces uncertainty.</p>
<p>Could the earth actually be flat?</p>
<p>Extremely unlikely, extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>And so it is a ridiculous notion</p>
<p>if we care about how probable and certain our ideas might be.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s incredibly important</p>
<p>to talk about science in that way</p>
<p>and to not resort to, well, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true in the same way that a mathematical theorem</p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re kind of like being pretty pedantic</p>
<p>about defining this stuff.</p>
<p>But like, sure, I could take a rocket ship out</p>
<p>and I could orbit earth and look at it</p>
<p>and it would look like a ball, right?</p>
<p>But I still can&rsquo;t prove that I&rsquo;m not living in a simulation,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not a brain in a vat,</p>
<p>that this isn&rsquo;t all an elaborate ruse</p>
<p>created by some technologically advanced</p>
<p>extraterrestrial civilization.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always some doubt and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>And I think that kind of doubt, practically speaking,</p>
<p>is useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics</p>
<p>or string theory, sort of, it helps.</p>
<p>To me, that kind of adds a little spice</p>
<p>into the thinking process of scientists.</p>
<p>So, I mean, just as a thought experiment,</p>
<p>your video kind of, okay, say the earth is flat.</p>
<p>What would the forces when you walk about this flat earth</p>
<p>feel like to the human?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really nice thought experiment to think about.</p>
<p>Right, because what&rsquo;s really nice about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a funny thought experiment,</p>
<p>but you actually wind up accidentally learning</p>
<p>a whole lot about gravity and about relativity</p>
<p>and geometry.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really the goal of what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to like convince people</p>
<p>that the earth is round.</p>
<p>I feel like you either believe that it is or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and like, that&rsquo;s, you know, how can I change that?</p>
<p>What I can do is change how you think</p>
<p>and how you are introduced to important concepts.</p>
<p>Like, well, how does gravity operate?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s all about the center of mass of an object.</p>
<p>So right, on a sphere, we&rsquo;re all pulled towards the middle,</p>
<p>essentially the centroid geometrically,</p>
<p>but on a disc, ooh, you&rsquo;re gonna be pulled at a weird angle</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out near the edge.</p>
<p>And that stuff&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, and to me, that was, that particular video</p>
<p>opened my eyes even more to what gravity is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a really nice visualization tool of,</p>
<p>because you always imagine gravity with spheres,</p>
<p>with masses that are spheres.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And imagining gravity on masses that are not spherical,</p>
<p>some other shape, but in here, a plate, a flat object,</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>It makes you really kind of visualize</p>
<p>in a three dimensional way the force of gravity.</p>
<p>Yeah, even if a disc the size of Earth would be impossible,</p>
<p>I think anything larger than like the moon basically</p>
<p>needs to be a sphere because gravity will round it out.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t have a teacup the size of Jupiter, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book about the teacup in the universe</p>
<p>that I highly recommend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the author.</p>
<p>I forget her name, but it&rsquo;s a wonderful book.</p>
<p>So look it up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called Teacup in the Universe.</p>
<p>Just to link on this point briefly,</p>
<p>your videos are generally super, people love them, right?</p>
<p>If you look at the sort of number of likes versus dislikes</p>
<p>is this measure of YouTube, right, is incredible.</p>
<p>And as do I.</p>
<p>But this particular flat Earth video</p>
<p>has more dislikes than usual.</p>
<p>What do you, on that topic in general,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense, how big is the community,</p>
<p>not just who believes in flat Earth,</p>
<p>but sort of the anti scientific community</p>
<p>that naturally distrust scientists in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an open minded way,</p>
<p>like really just distrust scientists</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re bought by some kind of mechanism</p>
<p>of some kind of bigger system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to manipulate human beings.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of the size of that community?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the sort of great educators in the world</p>
<p>that educates people on the exciting power of science.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of up against this community.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of it?</p>
<p>I really have no idea.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked at the likes and dislikes</p>
<p>on the flat Earth video.</p>
<p>And so I would wonder if it has a greater percentage</p>
<p>of dislikes than usual,</p>
<p>is that because of people disliking it</p>
<p>because they think that it&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>about Earth being flat and they find that ridiculous</p>
<p>and they dislike it without even really watching much?</p>
<p>Do they wish that I was more like dismissive</p>
<p>of flat Earth theories?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible too.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of response videos</p>
<p>that kind of go through the episode and are pro flat Earth,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a larger community</p>
<p>of unorthodox thinkers today</p>
<p>than there have been in the past.</p>
<p>And I just wanna not lose them.</p>
<p>I want them to keep listening and thinking</p>
<p>and by calling them all idiots or something,</p>
<p>that does no good because how idiotic are they really?</p>
<p>I mean, the Earth isn&rsquo;t a sphere at all.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s an oblate spheroid</p>
<p>and that in and of itself is really interesting.</p>
<p>And I investigated that in which way is down</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, really down does not point</p>
<p>towards the center of the Earth.</p>
<p>It points in different direction,</p>
<p>depending on what&rsquo;s underneath you and what&rsquo;s above you</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s around you.</p>
<p>The whole universe is tugging on me.</p>
<p>And then you also show that gravity is non uniform</p>
<p>across the globe.</p>
<p>Like if you, there&rsquo;s this I guess thought experiment</p>
<p>if you build a bridge all the way across the Earth</p>
<p>and then just knock out its pillars, what would happen?</p>
<p>And you describe how it would be like a very chaotic,</p>
<p>unstable thing that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>because gravity is non uniform throughout the Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, in small spaces, like the ones we work in,</p>
<p>we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It is weaker the further you are from the Earth.</p>
<p>And it also is going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s radially pointed towards the middle of the Earth.</p>
<p>So a really large object will feel tidal forces</p>
<p>because of that non uniformness.</p>
<p>And we can take advantage of that with satellites, right?</p>
<p>Gravitational induced torque.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way to align your satellite</p>
<p>without having to use fuel or any kind of engine.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump back to it, artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thought of the state of where we are at</p>
<p>currently with artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and what do you think it takes to build human level</p>
<p>or superhuman level intelligence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what intelligence means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my biggest question at the moment.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because my instinct is always to go,</p>
<p>well, what are the foundations here of our discussion?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be intelligent?</p>
<p>How do we measure the intelligence of an artificial machine</p>
<p>or a program or something?</p>
<p>Can we say that humans are intelligent?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s also a fascinating field</p>
<p>of how do you measure human intelligence.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>But if we just take that for granted,</p>
<p>saying that whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about, humans kind of have it.</p>
<p>What would be a good test for you?</p>
<p>So during develop a test that&rsquo;s natural language</p>
<p>conversation, would that impress you?</p>
<p>A chat bot that you&rsquo;d want to hang out</p>
<p>and have a beer with for a bunch of hours</p>
<p>or have dinner plans with.</p>
<p>Is that a good test, natural language conversation?</p>
<p>Is there something else that would impress you?</p>
<p>Or is that also too difficult to think about?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty much impressed by everything.</p>
<p>I think that if there was a chat bot</p>
<p>that was like incredibly, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>really had a personality.</p>
<p>And if I didn&rsquo;t be the Turing test, right?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m unable to tell that it&rsquo;s not another person</p>
<p>but then I was shown a bunch of wires</p>
<p>and mechanical components.</p>
<p>And it was like, that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would feel that guilty destroying it.</p>
<p>I would feel guilty because clearly it&rsquo;s well made</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really cool thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like destroying a really cool car or something</p>
<p>but I would not feel like I was a murderer.</p>
<p>So yeah, at what point would I start to feel that way?</p>
<p>And this is such a subjective psychological question.</p>
<p>If you give it movement or if you have it act as though</p>
<p>or perhaps really feel pain as I destroy it</p>
<p>and scream and resist, then I&rsquo;d feel bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say act like it&rsquo;s a pain.</p>
<p>So if you just have a robot that not screams,</p>
<p>just like moans in pain if you kick it,</p>
<p>that immediately just puts it in a class</p>
<p>that we humans, it becomes, we anthropomorphize it.</p>
<p>It almost immediately becomes human.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a psychology question</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of a physics question.</p>
<p>Right, I think that&rsquo;s a really good instinct to have.</p>
<p>If the robot.</p>
<p>Screams.</p>
<p>Screams and moans, even if you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that it has the mental experience,</p>
<p>the qualia of pain and suffering,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s still a good instinct to say,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;d rather not hurt it.</p>
<p>The problem is that instinct can get us in trouble</p>
<p>because then robots can manipulate that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different kinds of robots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s robots like the Facebook and the YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>that recommends the video,</p>
<p>and they can manipulate in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you just to stick</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence for a second.</p>
<p>Do you have worries about existential threats from AI</p>
<p>or existential threats from other technologies</p>
<p>like nuclear weapons that could potentially destroy life</p>
<p>on earth or damage it to a very significant degree?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course I do.</p>
<p>Especially the weapons that we create.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of famous ways to think about this.</p>
<p>And one is that, wow, what if we don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>advanced alien civilizations because of the danger</p>
<p>of technology?</p>
<p>What if we reach a point,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a channel, Thoughty2,</p>
<p>geez, I wish I remembered the name of the channel,</p>
<p>but he delves into this kind of limit</p>
<p>of maybe once you discover radioactivity and its power,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve reached this important hurdle.</p>
<p>And the reason that the skies are so empty</p>
<p>is that no one&rsquo;s ever managed to survive as a civilization</p>
<p>once they have that destructive power.</p>
<p>And when it comes to AI, I&rsquo;m not really very worried</p>
<p>because I think that there are plenty of other people</p>
<p>that are already worried enough.</p>
<p>And oftentimes these worries are just,</p>
<p>they just get in the way of progress.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re questions that we should address later.</p>
<p>And I think I talk about this in my interview</p>
<p>with the self driving autonomous vehicle guy,</p>
<p>as I think it was a bonus scene</p>
<p>from the trolley problem episode.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wow, what should a car do</p>
<p>if this really weird contrived scenario happens</p>
<p>where it has to swerve and save the driver, but kill a kid?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, what would a human do?</p>
<p>And if we resist technological progress</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re worried about all of these little issues,</p>
<p>then it gets in the way.</p>
<p>And we shouldn&rsquo;t avoid those problems,</p>
<p>but we shouldn&rsquo;t allow them to be stumbling blocks</p>
<p>to advancement.</p>
<p>So the folks like Sam Harris or Elon Musk</p>
<p>are saying that we&rsquo;re not worried enough.</p>
<p>So the worry should not paralyze technological progress,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re sort of marching,</p>
<p>technology is marching forward without the key scientists,</p>
<p>the developing of technology,</p>
<p>worrying about the overnight having some effects</p>
<p>that would be very detrimental to society.</p>
<p>So to push back on your thought of the idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s enough people worrying about it,</p>
<p>Elon Musk says, there&rsquo;s not enough people</p>
<p>worrying about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of balance is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like folks who are really focused</p>
<p>on nuclear deterrence are saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough people worried</p>
<p>about nuclear deterrence, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting question of what is a good threshold</p>
<p>of people to worry about these?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s too many people that are worried, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like the press would over report on it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be technological, halt technological progress.</p>
<p>If not enough, then we can march straight ahead</p>
<p>into that abyss that human beings might be destined for</p>
<p>with the progress of technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what the right balance is</p>
<p>of how many people should be worried</p>
<p>and how worried should they be,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re always worried about new technology.</p>
<p>We know that Plato was worried about the written word.</p>
<p>He was like, we shouldn&rsquo;t teach people to write</p>
<p>because then they won&rsquo;t use their minds to remember things.</p>
<p>There have been concerns over technology</p>
<p>and its advancement since the beginning of recorded history.</p>
<p>And so, I think, however,</p>
<p>these conversations are really important to have</p>
<p>because again, we learn a lot about ourselves.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re really scared of some kind of AI</p>
<p>like coming into being that is conscious or whatever</p>
<p>and can self replicate, we already do that every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called humans being born.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not artificial, they&rsquo;re humans,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re intelligent and I don&rsquo;t wanna live in a world</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re worried about babies being born</p>
<p>because what if they become evil?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What if they become mean people?</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re thieves?</p>
<p>Maybe we should just like, what, not have babies born?</p>
<p>Like maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t create AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we will want to have safeguards in place</p>
<p>in the same way that we know, look,</p>
<p>a kid could be born that becomes some kind of evil person,</p>
<p>but we have laws, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that with advanced genetics in general,</p>
<p>be able to, it&rsquo;s a scary thought to say that,</p>
<p>this, my child, if born would have an 83% chance</p>
<p>of being a psychopath, right?</p>
<p>Like being able to, if it&rsquo;s something genetic,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some sort of, and what to use that information,</p>
<p>what to do with that information</p>
<p>is a difficult ethical thought.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;d like to find an answer that isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s not have them live.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d like to find an answer that is,</p>
<p>well, all human life is worthy.</p>
<p>And if you have an 83% chance of becoming a psychopath,</p>
<p>well, you still deserve dignity.</p>
<p>And you still deserve to be treated well.</p>
<p>You still have rights.</p>
<p>At least at this part of the world, at least in America,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a respect for individual life in that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, well, to me, but again, I&rsquo;m in this bubble,</p>
<p>is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other cultures where individual human life</p>
<p>is not that important, where a society,</p>
<p>so I was born in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>where the strength of nation and society together</p>
<p>is more important than any one particular individual.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting also notion,</p>
<p>the stories we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>I like the one where individuals matter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unclear that that was what the future holds.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and I mean, let me even throw this out.</p>
<p>Like, what is artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>How can it be artificial?</p>
<p>I really think that we get pretty obsessed</p>
<p>and stuck on the idea that there is some thing</p>
<p>that is a wild human, a pure human organism</p>
<p>without technology.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>I think that humans and human technology are one organism.</p>
<p>Look at my glasses, okay?</p>
<p>If an alien came down and saw me,</p>
<p>would they necessarily know that this is an invention,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t grow these organically from my body?</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t know that right away.</p>
<p>And the written word, and spoons, and cups,</p>
<p>these are all pieces of technology.</p>
<p>We are not alone as an organism.</p>
<p>And so the technology we create,</p>
<p>whether it be video games or artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that can self replicate and hate us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually all the same organism.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a car, where do you end in the car begin?</p>
<p>It seems like a really easy question to answer,</p>
<p>but the more you think about it,</p>
<p>the more you realize, wow,</p>
<p>we are in this symbiotic relationship with our inventions.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of people who are worried about it.</p>
<p>And there should be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>And I think that even just us think of ourselves</p>
<p>as individual intelligences may be silly notion</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much better to think</p>
<p>of the entirety of human civilization.</p>
<p>All living organisms on earth is a single living organism.</p>
<p>As a single intelligent creature,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re right, everything&rsquo;s intertwined.</p>
<p>Everything is deeply connected.</p>
<p>So we mentioned, you know,</p>
<p>Musk, so you&rsquo;re a curious lover of science.</p>
<p>What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing</p>
<p>with space exploration, with electric vehicles,</p>
<p>with autopilot, sort of getting into the space</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles, with boring under LA</p>
<p>and a Neuralink trying to communicate brain machine</p>
<p>interfaces, communicate between machines</p>
<p>and human brains?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the fandom that he&rsquo;s amassed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not common for someone like that</p>
<p>to have such a following.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s&hellip; Engineering nerd.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>But I also think that a lot of responsibility</p>
<p>comes with that kind of power.</p>
<p>So like if I met him, I would love to hear how he feels</p>
<p>about the responsibility he has.</p>
<p>When there are people who are such a fan of your ideas</p>
<p>and your dreams and share them so closely with you,</p>
<p>you have a lot of power.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t always have that, you know?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t born as Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Well, he was, but well, he was named that later.</p>
<p>But the point is that I wanna know the psychology</p>
<p>of becoming a figure like him.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t even know how to phrase the question right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a question about what do you do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re following, your fans become so large</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost bigger than you.</p>
<p>And how do you responsibly manage that?</p>
<p>And maybe it doesn&rsquo;t worry him at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d be really curious.</p>
<p>And I think there are a lot of people that go through this</p>
<p>when they realize, whoa, there are a lot of eyes on me.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who really take what I say</p>
<p>very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me.</p>
<p>And whew, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that can be dangerous.</p>
<p>And you have to be responsible with it.</p>
<p>Both in terms of impact on society</p>
<p>and psychologically for the individual,</p>
<p>just the burden psychologically on Elon?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, how does he think about that?</p>
<p>Part of his persona.</p>
<p>Well, let me throw that right back at you</p>
<p>because in some ways you&rsquo;re just a funny guy</p>
<p>that gotten a humongous following,</p>
<p>a funny guy with a curiosity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a huge following.</p>
<p>How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility?</p>
<p>In many ways you have a reach</p>
<p>in many ways bigger than Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What is your, what is the burden that you feel in educating</p>
<p>being one of the biggest educators in the world</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s listening to you</p>
<p>and actually everybody, like most of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uses YouTube for educational material,</p>
<p>trust you as a source of good, strong scientific thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a burden and I try to approach it</p>
<p>with a lot of humility and sharing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not out there doing</p>
<p>a lot of scientific experiments.</p>
<p>I am sharing the work of real scientists</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m celebrating their work and the way that they think</p>
<p>and the power of curiosity.</p>
<p>But I wanna make it clear at all times that like,</p>
<p>look, we don&rsquo;t know all the answers</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re ever going to reach a point</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re like, wow, and there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this equation, you plug in some conditions or whatever</p>
<p>and you do the math</p>
<p>and you know what&rsquo;s gonna happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re ever gonna reach that point,</p>
<p>but I think that there is a tendency</p>
<p>to sometimes believe in science and become elitist</p>
<p>and become, I don&rsquo;t know, hard when in reality</p>
<p>it should humble you and make you feel smaller.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something very beautiful</p>
<p>about feeling very, very small and very weak</p>
<p>and to feel that you need other people.</p>
<p>So I try to keep that in mind and say,</p>
<p>look, thanks for watching.</p>
<p>Vsauce is not, I&rsquo;m not Vsauce, you are.</p>
<p>When I start the episodes, I say,</p>
<p>hey, Vsauce, Michael here.</p>
<p>Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing</p>
<p>in my mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s always clear,</p>
<p>but yeah, I have to approach it that way</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not feeling the responsibility.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just sort of plugging into this big thing</p>
<p>that is scientific exploration of our reality</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a voice that represents a bunch,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just plugging into this big Vsauce ball</p>
<p>that others, millions of others are plugged into.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m just hoping to encourage curiosity</p>
<p>and responsible thinking</p>
<p>and an embracement of doubt</p>
<p>and being okay with that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m next week talking to Christos Gudrow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar who he is,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the VP of engineering,</p>
<p>head of the quote unquote YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>or the search and discovery.</p>
<p>So let me ask, first high level,</p>
<p>do you have a question for him</p>
<p>that if you can get an honest answer that you would ask,</p>
<p>but more generally,</p>
<p>how do you think about the YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>that drives some of the motivation behind,</p>
<p>no, some of the design decisions you make</p>
<p>as you ask and answer some of the questions you do,</p>
<p>how would you improve this algorithm in your mind in general?</p>
<p>So just what would you ask him?</p>
<p>And outside of that,</p>
<p>how would you like to see the algorithm improve?</p>
<p>Well, I think of the algorithm as a mirror.</p>
<p>It reflects what people put in</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t always like what we see in that mirror.</p>
<p>From the individual mirror</p>
<p>to the individual mirror to the society.</p>
<p>Both, in the aggregate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reflecting back what people on average want to watch.</p>
<p>And when you see things being recommended to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reflecting back what it thinks you want to see.</p>
<p>And specifically, I would guess that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just what you want to see,</p>
<p>but what you will click on</p>
<p>and what you will watch some of and stay on YouTube</p>
<p>because of.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that, this is all me guessing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that YouTube cares</p>
<p>if you only watch like a second of a video,</p>
<p>as long as the next thing you do is open another video.</p>
<p>If you close the app or close the site,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem for them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not a subscription platform.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like, look,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving us 20 bucks a month no matter what,</p>
<p>so who cares?</p>
<p>They need you to watch and spend time there and see ads.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;m curious about</p>
<p>whether they do consider longer term sort of develop,</p>
<p>your longer term development as a human being,</p>
<p>which I think ultimately will make you feel better</p>
<p>about using YouTube in the longterm</p>
<p>and allowing you to stick with it for longer.</p>
<p>Because even if you feed the dopamine rush in the short term</p>
<p>and you keep clicking on cat videos,</p>
<p>eventually you sort of wake up like from a drug</p>
<p>and say, I need to quit this.</p>
<p>So I wonder how much you&rsquo;re trying to optimize</p>
<p>for the longterm because when I look at the,</p>
<p>your videos aren&rsquo;t exactly sort of, no offense,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the most clickable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both the most clickable</p>
<p>and I feel I watched the entire thing</p>
<p>and I feel a better human after I watched it, right?</p>
<p>So like they&rsquo;re not just optimizing for the clickability</p>
<p>because I hope, so my thought is how do you think of it?</p>
<p>And does it affect your own content?</p>
<p>Like how deep you go,</p>
<p>how profound you explore the directions and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really lucky in that I don&rsquo;t worry too much</p>
<p>about the algorithm.</p>
<p>I mean, look at my thumbnails.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really go too wild with them.</p>
<p>And with minefield where I&rsquo;m in partnership with YouTube</p>
<p>on the thumbnails, I&rsquo;m often like, let&rsquo;s pull this back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be mysterious.</p>
<p>But usually I&rsquo;m just trying to do</p>
<p>what everyone else is not doing.</p>
<p>So if everyone&rsquo;s doing crazy Photoshop kind of thumbnails,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what if the thumbnails just a line?</p>
<p>And what if the title is just a word?</p>
<p>And I kind of feel like all of the Vsauce channels</p>
<p>have cultivated an audience that expects that.</p>
<p>And so they would rather Jake make a video</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just called stains than one called,</p>
<p>I explored stains, shocking.</p>
<p>But there are other audiences out there that want that.</p>
<p>And I think most people kind of want</p>
<p>what you see the algorithm favoring,</p>
<p>which is mainstream traditional celebrity</p>
<p>and news kind of information.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what makes YouTube really different</p>
<p>than other streaming platforms.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s going on in the world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll open up Netflix to find out.</p>
<p>But you do open up Twitter to find that out.</p>
<p>You open up Facebook and you can open up YouTube</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll see that the trending videos</p>
<p>are like what happened amongst the traditional mainstream</p>
<p>people in different industries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being shown.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessarily YouTube saying,</p>
<p>we want that to be what you see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s what people click on.</p>
<p>When they see Ariana Grande, you know,</p>
<p>reads a love letter from like her high school sweetheart,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, I wanna see that.</p>
<p>And when they see a video from me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got some lines in math and it&rsquo;s called law and causes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, well, I mean, I&rsquo;m just on the bus.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have time to dive into a whole lesson.</p>
<p>So, you know, before you get super mad at YouTube,</p>
<p>you should say, really,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just reflecting back human behavior.</p>
<p>Is there something you would improve about the algorithm</p>
<p>knowing of course, that as far as we&rsquo;re concerned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a black box, so we don&rsquo;t know how it works.</p>
<p>Right, and I don&rsquo;t think that even anyone at YouTube</p>
<p>really knows what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>They know what they&rsquo;ve tweaked, but then it learns.</p>
<p>I think that it learns and it decides how to behave.</p>
<p>And sometimes the YouTube employees are left going,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe we should like change the value</p>
<p>of how much it, you know, worries about watch time.</p>
<p>And maybe it should worry more about something else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I mean, I would like to see,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing and not doing.</p>
<p>Well, is there a conversation</p>
<p>that you think they should be having just internally,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re having it or not?</p>
<p>Is there something,</p>
<p>should they be thinking about the longterm future?</p>
<p>Should they be thinking about educational content</p>
<p>and whether that&rsquo;s educating about what just happened</p>
<p>in the world today, news or educational content,</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re providing,</p>
<p>which is asking big sort of timeless questions</p>
<p>about how the way the world works.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>What should they think about?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s called YouTube, not our tube.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think they have</p>
<p>so many phenomenal educational creators.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have shows like Three Blue One Brown</p>
<p>or Physics Girl or Looking Glass Universe or Up and Atom</p>
<p>or Brain Scoop or, I mean, I could go on and on.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t on Amazon Prime and Netflix</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have commissioned shows from those platforms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all organically happening</p>
<p>because there are people out there</p>
<p>that want to share their passion for learning,</p>
<p>that wanna share their curiosity.</p>
<p>And YouTube could promote those kinds of shows more,</p>
<p>but first of all, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t get as many clicks</p>
<p>and YouTube needs to make sure that the average user</p>
<p>is always clicking and staying on the site.</p>
<p>They could still promote it more for the good of society,</p>
<p>but then we&rsquo;re making some really weird claims</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s good for society</p>
<p>because I think that cat videos</p>
<p>are also an incredibly important part</p>
<p>of what it means to be a human.</p>
<p>I mentioned this quote before from Unumuno about,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;ve seen a cat like estimate distances</p>
<p>and calculate a jump more often than I&rsquo;ve seen a cat cry.</p>
<p>And so things that play with our emotions</p>
<p>and make us feel things can be cheesy and can feel cheap,</p>
<p>but like, man, that&rsquo;s very human.</p>
<p>And so even the dumbest vlog is still so important</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think I have a better claim to take its spot</p>
<p>than it has to have that spot.</p>
<p>It puts a mirror to us, the beautiful parts,</p>
<p>the ugly parts, the shallow parts, the deep parts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>What I would like to see is,</p>
<p>I miss the days when engaging with content on YouTube</p>
<p>helped push it into my subscribers timelines.</p>
<p>It used to be that when I liked a video,</p>
<p>say from Veritasium, it would show up in the feed</p>
<p>on the front page of the app or the website of my subscribers.</p>
<p>And I knew that if I liked a video,</p>
<p>I could send it 100,000 views or more.</p>
<p>That no longer is true,</p>
<p>but I think that was a good user experience.</p>
<p>When I subscribe to someone, when I&rsquo;m following them,</p>
<p>I want to see more of what they like.</p>
<p>I want them to also curate the feed for me.</p>
<p>And I think that Twitter and Facebook are doing that</p>
<p>in also some ways that are kind of annoying,</p>
<p>but I would like that to happen more.</p>
<p>And I think we would see communities being stronger</p>
<p>on YouTube if it was that way instead of YouTube going,</p>
<p>well, technically Michael liked this Veritasium video,</p>
<p>but people are way more likely to click on Carpool Karaoke.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even care who they are, just give them that.</p>
<p>Not saying anything against Carpool Karaoke,</p>
<p>that is a extremely important part of our society,</p>
<p>what it means to be a human on earth, you know, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it sucks, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of people would disagree with you</p>
<p>and they should be able to see as much of that as they want.</p>
<p>And I think even people who don&rsquo;t think they like it</p>
<p>should still be really aware of it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an important thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an influential thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, I just wish that like new channels I discover</p>
<p>and that I subscribe to,</p>
<p>I wish that my subscribers found out about that</p>
<p>because especially in the education community,</p>
<p>a rising tide floats all boats.</p>
<p>If you watch a video from Numberphile,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just more likely to want to watch an episode from me,</p>
<p>whether it be on Vsauce1 or Ding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not competitive in the way that traditional TV was</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, well, if you tune into that show,</p>
<p>it means you&rsquo;re not watching mine</p>
<p>because they both air at the same time.</p>
<p>So helping each other out through collaborations</p>
<p>takes a lot of work,</p>
<p>but just through engaging, commenting on their videos,</p>
<p>liking their videos, subscribing to them, whatever,</p>
<p>that I would love to see become easier and more powerful.</p>
<p>So a quick and impossibly deep question,</p>
<p>last question about mortality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about death as an interesting topic.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Yeah, every day, it&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the meaning of life</p>
<p>that mortality makes very explicit?</p>
<p>So why are you here on earth, Michael?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What does mortality in the context of the whole universe</p>
<p>make you realize about yourself?</p>
<p>Just you, Michael Stevens.</p>
<p>Well, it makes me realize</p>
<p>that I am destined to become a notion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m destined to become a memory and we can extend life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s really exciting things being done</p>
<p>to extend life,</p>
<p>but we still don&rsquo;t know how to protect you</p>
<p>from some accident that could happen,</p>
<p>some unforeseen thing.</p>
<p>Maybe we could save my connectome</p>
<p>and recreate my consciousness digitally,</p>
<p>but even that could be lost</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s stored on a physical medium or something.</p>
<p>So basically, I just think that embracing</p>
<p>and realizing how cool it is,</p>
<p>that someday I will just be an idea.</p>
<p>And there won&rsquo;t be a Michael anymore</p>
<p>that can be like, no, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just be what people,</p>
<p>they have to guess what I meant.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll remember me</p>
<p>and how I live on as that memory</p>
<p>will maybe not even be who I want it to be.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something powerful about that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something powerful</p>
<p>about letting future people run the show themselves.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m glad to get out of their way at some point</p>
<p>and say, all right, it&rsquo;s your world now.</p>
<p>So you, the physical entity, Michael,</p>
<p>have ripple effects in the space of ideas</p>
<p>that far outlives you in ways that you can&rsquo;t control,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nevertheless fascinating to think,</p>
<p>I mean, especially with you,</p>
<p>you can imagine an alien species</p>
<p>when they finally arrive and destroy all of us</p>
<p>would watch your videos to try to figure out</p>
<p>what were the questions that these people.</p>
<p>But even if they didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I still think that there will be ripples.</p>
<p>Like when I say memory,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t specifically mean people remember my name</p>
<p>and my birth date and like there&rsquo;s a photo of me</p>
<p>on Wikipedia, like all that can be lost,</p>
<p>but I still would hope that people ask questions</p>
<p>and teach concepts in some of the ways</p>
<p>that I have found useful and satisfying.</p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t know that I was the one</p>
<p>who tried to popularize it, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But if Earth was completely destroyed,</p>
<p>like burnt to a crisp, everything on it today,</p>
<p>what would, the universe wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like Jupiter&rsquo;s not gonna go, oh no, and that could happen.</p>
<p>So we do however have the power to launch things</p>
<p>into space to try to extend how long our memory exists.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>we are recording things about the world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re learning things and writing stories</p>
<p>and all of this and preserving that is truly</p>
<p>what I think is the essence of being a human.</p>
<p>We are autobiographers of the universe</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really good at it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re better than fossils.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re better than light spectrum.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re better than any of that.</p>
<p>We collect much more detailed memories</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening, much better data.</p>
<p>And so that should be our legacy.</p>
<p>And I hope that that&rsquo;s kind of mine too</p>
<p>in terms of people remembering something</p>
<p>or having some kind of effect.</p>
<p>But even if I don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t not have an effect.</p>
<p>This is not me feeling like,</p>
<p>I hope that I have this powerful legacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no matter who you are, you will.</p>
<p>But you also have to embrace the fact</p>
<p>that that impact might look really small and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from Tessa the Durbervilles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s along the lines of the measure of your life</p>
<p>depends on not your external displacement</p>
<p>but your subjective experience.</p>
<p>If I am happy and those that I love are happy,</p>
<p>can that be enough?</p>
<p>Because if so, excellent.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better place to end it, Michael.</p>

<p>from Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>The important thing is not to stop questioning.</p>
<p>Curiosity has its own reason for existence.</p>
<p>One cannot help but be in awe</p>
<p>when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,</p>
<p>of life, the marvelous structure of reality.</p>
<p>It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend</p>
<p>a little of this mystery every day.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
