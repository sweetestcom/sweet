    <p>Pumps, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>I have had it with my kids&rsquo; cell phones constantly dinging, like vibrating.</p>
<p>Like we sit down to watch a movie and we&rsquo;re in the middle of a vibration, like an earthquake</p>
<p>of everybody&rsquo;s phone, like, and it&rsquo;s all that fucking Snapchat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re wondering why ADD is on the rise.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because these fucking phones go off every 10 seconds or one second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Do your kids do this thing where all of a sudden they&rsquo;re like on their phone, then all</p>
<p>of a sudden you see them hold the phone up and they&rsquo;re like, and it&rsquo;s like they have</p>
<p>a Snapchat streak with somebody, so they have to keep the streak going and they send these</p>
<p>horrible selfies.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>Like you would never want to be caught dead in these selfies.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re sending them out to hundreds of people.</p>
<p>But when I would take Emily&rsquo;s phone away, it would be like, Mom, I have got to continue</p>
<p>my Snap streak.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been 947 days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, then you shouldn&rsquo;t have, whatever you did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, aside from my dogs and then the kids, there&rsquo;s anybody I want to be involved</p>
<p>in that long of a streak with.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, we do have a Wordle group.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s not constantly buzzing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only once a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It is once a day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>Too much constant on the phone, on the phone, on the phone.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s not going to change.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they talk on the phone.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I remember not too long ago, my oldest couldn&rsquo;t order a pizza by phone.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like I was watching somebody that had been trapped in a hole his entire</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Because ordering a pizza, the communication that was required to just place the pepperoni</p>
<p>pizza order was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Do you remember like back in the day, in the 80s, the landline days where we would have,</p>
<p>like at my house, we had a home phone number and then there was a teenager&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Yes, I remember this.</p>
<p>I was never allowed to get one, but I wanted one.</p>
<p>Like the super cool people had their own line.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, no surprise to anyone, I had my own teenager&rsquo;s line and I remember the</p>
<p>number.</p>
<p>Oh, you do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I do think the one thing about a cell phone that has taken a lot away from the rest of</p>
<p>the world, the younger generation, is prank calling.</p>
<p>Like prank calling was a blast.</p>
<p>Prank calling was so much fun.</p>
<p>It was fantastic.</p>
<p>And when caller ID came out.</p>
<p>It ruined it.</p>
<p>It was just throwing a grenade.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t prank call anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re busted.</p>
<p>It was so much fun.</p>
<p>My mother was a prolific prank caller.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen you before.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so she would get in on it.</p>
<p>No, prank calling was so fun.</p>
<p>So much fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it was the best.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just been taken away.</p>
<p>They have no idea how fun it would be to prank call people.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on the phones.</p>
<p>I mean, I like my phone.</p>
<p>I like to look at Instagram.</p>
<p>I like to read the news.</p>
<p>I like to do Wordle.</p>
<p>But everybody being able to contact you all the time really irritates me because I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have clients that&rsquo;ll start texting me at like 7 a.m.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this is like my time.</p>
<p>I can gear up for all every grievance you have with me or every paint color you want</p>
<p>to talk about starting at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all yours.</p>
<p>But when you start texting and they&rsquo;re like, oh, no, you can respond when you want to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>You sent to me at 7, so it&rsquo;s already in my head.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve completely removed me from my Jennifer time, from my Serenity time.</p>
<p>You know, I have a lot of things I do with the dogs in the morning.</p>
<p>We get their eye boogers out.</p>
<p>We do scratching so that they can have a soft landing to their morning, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>an eye booger free soft landing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know, Frenchies can get little eye boogers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep all of that very clean on your dogs.</p>
<p>Do you do get your dogs eye boogers?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he has eye boogers.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve noticed your dog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But no, I haven&rsquo;t noticed prolific eye boogers on.</p>
<p>I think what you just told me last night, when you walk your dog, you wait a day.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That happened one time, one, because I just didn&rsquo;t have it in me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let the listener know what I was about to say.</p>
<p>Okay, but I can&rsquo;t believe you were bringing this up.</p>
<p>Misdefensive.</p>
<p>Misdefensive.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the worst.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So listener pumps.</p>
<p>She was walking her dog, which is like a wolf, like a Siberian Husky type dog.</p>
<p>And he took a shit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And she did not immediately pick it up because with the baggy, because it was going to be</p>
<p>too warm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just kind of grosses me out when it&rsquo;s so warm.</p>
<p>She claims that she let it sit overnight, a full 24 hours, went back once it was hardened</p>
<p>and removed the poop then.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>You left that out for multiple people could have stepped in that.</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s between the street and then there&rsquo;s a little leaf of grass and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the sidewalk.</p>
<p>So there would be no reason for you to be not on pavement.</p>
<p>Well, I think some people might like to walk on grass and they have to walk by it and see</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I think you have to be an immediate pooper scooper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an immediate.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I normally do.</p>
<p>My dogs have had very unattractive bowel movements and I try to do everything I can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you wipe Cha Cha&rsquo;s ass on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>Dog hygiene is important.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;ve never had to do that.</p>
<p>Dog hygiene is important.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I did go back.</p>
<p>I just thought as he was sitting there, I mean, he&rsquo;s 93 pounds, so it&rsquo;s like a human</p>
<p>poop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so big.</p>
<p>And I just thought, I can&rsquo;t do it right now.</p>
<p>I think you need to be a better pet owner.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with being a pet owner.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear what I&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>Not really, but go ahead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the name of our podcast.</p>
<p>I know, but you&rsquo;re being so rude about my dog habits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to indulge me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I do, for the record, for the permanent record.</p>
<p>I do think you could be a better dog owner, but we&rsquo;ll get on to that another date.</p>
<p>I just want the last word.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I just want to tell you, you treat your dogs like a human, so there&rsquo;s no way that</p>
<p>a normal person that treats their dog like a dog is ever going to meet your human dog</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>I take offense to that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Because I treat my dogs better than I treat humans.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Treating an animal like a human is just the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I treat my dogs a million times better than I treat human beings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Jennifer, what have you had it with?</p>
<p>Thank you for asking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Pumps.</p>
<p>So I have had it with on Instagram.</p>
<p>So we, if you, listener, if you don&rsquo;t follow us on Instagram, Pumps will swing by the office</p>
<p>and we sit on the sofa in my lobby and we do, we read hate comments and there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>fabulous photograph behind us on the wall that my husband took while we were traveling</p>
<p>in Italy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like these Italian boys probably ranging from 22 down to maybe 10 or so hanging</p>
<p>out on the beach.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of my favorite images.</p>
<p>I have it blown up in my house.</p>
<p>I have it blown up in the office.</p>
<p>Every time I see it, I think how cool it is that probably generations of these families</p>
<p>have swam at the beach and hung out at this particular beach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever thought about it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing these, you know, we&rsquo;re reading these hate comments, which you and I get a</p>
<p>big kick out of.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Morgan, who works in the office, tells me, yeah, people keep commenting on the photograph</p>
<p>behind you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, they like it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They love it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these QAnoners and they, the suggestion is that it&rsquo;s some type of kiddie porn.</p>
<p>And it just amazes me how much when, when people see an image that that&rsquo;s where their</p>
<p>head goes.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s nothing sexual about it at all.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, and they&rsquo;re like remotely, it&rsquo;s not even remotely sexual.</p>
<p>There is pedophilia and there are documented cases and it is horrible and everybody opposes</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Nobody stands for pedophilia.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Everybody opposes pedophilia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all united on that front.</p>
<p>But there are people out there that think that there is this like, you know, huge movement</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s eating babies and there&rsquo;s large percentages of people that believe this.</p>
<p>And it really, really fascinates me a lot.</p>
<p>And so I think you&rsquo;re going to be super excited about our guest today.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you watched The Vow.</p>
<p>Loved it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listener, The Vow on HBO follows the NXIVM cult and there&rsquo;s two seasons and Pumps and</p>
<p>I were completely obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Obsessed.</p>
<p>One of the former cult members, Sarah Edmondson, that the documentary follows and she&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>of the cult and she&rsquo;s courageous and she&rsquo;s a survivor and she was a whistleblower and</p>
<p>she has a podcast called A Little Bit Culty.</p>
<p>She is going to join us today as we deep dive into cults because we&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it with cults.</p>
<p>Scientology?</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>QAnon?</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Pickleball?</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I see where this is going.</p>
<p>But without further ado, let&rsquo;s see if we can get Sarah on here.</p>
<p>Sarah, how are you?</p>
<p>I have a little bit of a cold, but other than that, I&rsquo;m great and really excited to be here.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited you&rsquo;re here, especially me.</p>
<p>I am like the biggest Sarah Edmondson fan on the planet.</p>
<p>I want you to be my best friend when we hang up.</p>
<p>I want us to like text every day.</p>
<p>I want to come visit you.</p>
<p>I mean, I really, I really am excited that you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>It turns out we actually have a mutual friend that I didn&rsquo;t know until I was researching</p>
<p>that Kate Casey is a mutual friend.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She was.</p>
<p>I love Kate Casey.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>We travel in a similar cult circuit on the podcast world.</p>
<p>So we, I said the same thing to her.</p>
<p>I want to be your best friend, even though we haven&rsquo;t met in person.</p>
<p>Well, Sarah, before you joined us, we were talking about QAnon.</p>
<p>The problem with QAnon, and truthfully, we haven&rsquo;t personally done a deep dive yet, mostly</p>
<p>because we, we interview survivors, right?</p>
<p>Not a lot of people have, some people have come out of it, but when they do, they tend</p>
<p>to kind of run for the hills because they&rsquo;re so embarrassed as many people are when they</p>
<p>realize that they&rsquo;ve been in a cult.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t found anyone to interview and we haven&rsquo;t really figured out what that process</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>But what we do know is that people are, you know, especially in the time of COVID and</p>
<p>the pandemic and people are very isolated and feeling lonely.</p>
<p>And they started to research, you know, if they&rsquo;re feeling uncomfortable with what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in the world and lots of crazy stuff&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And then they seem, they seem to have found an answer, right?</p>
<p>And they feel also that they&rsquo;ve found a community.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the midst of loneliness and being like, WTF is happening with our world and pandemic</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all alone.</p>
<p>We have to wear masks.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or whatever it is that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s fueling their, their searching desire.</p>
<p>And next thing you know, they feel like they found a group of people.</p>
<p>And then that information, because they&rsquo;re so isolated and in any, in any extreme, anything,</p>
<p>any religion, whether it&rsquo;s, you know, from QAnon to a yoga call to a extreme religious</p>
<p>sect, you know, offshoot of any sect.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they feel like they found answers and they feel like they found belonging, which</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s very normal for anybody, whether it&rsquo;s a pickleball group or a.</p>
<p>Have they been prepping you for this?</p>
<p>Have y&rsquo;all been talking to her behind my back?</p>
<p>I just did a little bit of research.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just prepared.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to take a look.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to take a deep dive in that on this episode.</p>
<p>And I do think that we should, and I want to expose something that I think she is culty</p>
<p>about too.</p>
<p>Well, listen, this is what I&rsquo;ve learned in my journey is that everyone who says to me,</p>
<p>well, you know, I&rsquo;m so glad you got out and that sounds crazy and good for you and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so brave, whatever.</p>
<p>But I would never fall for it.</p>
<p>And then they continue to tell me something they&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s totally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I think the automatic response is, oh, well, that can never happen to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it happens every single day, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t start out like horrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m a divorce attorney.</p>
<p>I see a lot of inter-family domestic abuse, not necessarily physical, but emotional.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t, it didn&rsquo;t start out that way.</p>
<p>They started out being loved and felt worthy and all of these things.</p>
<p>And then it switches and you&rsquo;re so far in, you don&rsquo;t know how to get out.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really sad.</p>
<p>Well, and I think the love bombing plays a huge component of that where you get love</p>
<p>bombed and that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And I think the brain, you know, when they scan it, when that&rsquo;s happening, it&rsquo;s a similar</p>
<p>reaction of being on drugs.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re seeking this high and everybody likes to hear how great they are, except for</p>
<p>how screwed up we are that we like to read our hate comments, which is another episode</p>
<p>entirely when we dive into emotional S&amp;M.</p>
<p>But I do think what&rsquo;s interesting about the QAnon is I was watching the news and this</p>
<p>was probably like a year ago and they have this meeting at the JFK assassination site.</p>
<p>And they are all certain that like either JFK or JFK Jr. both are going to show up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be Donald Trump&rsquo;s running mate.</p>
<p>And so I thought, you know, that maybe two people would show up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like 500 people in Dallas at the assassination site of John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my problem with it.</p>
<p>Number one, everybody knows both of these people are dead, okay?</p>
<p>But did they not get the memo or take in history that these people were Democrats?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I couldn&rsquo;t figure out.</p>
<p>So I think one thing I want, where does like rational thought suspend?</p>
<p>Does it happen slowly?</p>
<p>With all the cults and groups that we&rsquo;ve examined, it does happen slowly and every step is a</p>
<p>lift.</p>
<p>So like if they had said to me, hey, do you want to join this personal development group?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to have the leader&rsquo;s initials seared into your groin, right?</p>
<p>I would have been like, no, no.</p>
<p>So it starts with a personal development program that&rsquo;s really positive and really supportive.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a further commitment to my growth through becoming a coach and so forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different steps along the way, 12 years later, right?</p>
<p>So I think with QAnon, there&rsquo;s probably things that are very reasonable and very much reality-based</p>
<p>at first.</p>
<p>And if you accept certain things and you agree that there&rsquo;s truth to those things and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>part of this community and you&rsquo;re siloed in the information that you get, those things</p>
<p>start to make more and more sense.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not having anybody on the outside question it, which is QAnon or any group.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody saying, well, what about this or what about that?</p>
<p>And then outsiders are diminished and demeaned, right?</p>
<p>And labeled as the enemy or suppressors.</p>
<p>We watched The Vow that you were on, and then we&rsquo;ve watched some of the Scientology</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>And I do think, because I was not raised with any religion at all, which is really weird</p>
<p>because I was raised in the Bible Belt.</p>
<p>And everybody is super religious, but my mother is not religious at all, so was not indoctrinated</p>
<p>in any religion.</p>
<p>So my default setting is an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>However, I do see how you can be, because you can be in a relationship or a group of</p>
<p>people and you start to feel a sense of belonging and that feels good.</p>
<p>We crave that as people.</p>
<p>We crave togetherness and connectedness.</p>
<p>And I can see how the building blocks can raise, get more and more intense.</p>
<p>I remember this woman in Georgia and she&rsquo;s like suburban carpool mom, right?</p>
<p>So she goes down the QAnon rabbit hole and then she goes to Target during COVID and she</p>
<p>goes ape shit bananas and starts screaming about masks and throwing stuff over and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just going bonkers.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody gets their phones out, it goes viral.</p>
<p>She goes totally bat shit crazy.</p>
<p>She gets arrested, obviously.</p>
<p>And then she kind of gets deprogrammed.</p>
<p>And I saw her on like 2020 or something after this and she explained how, you know, there</p>
<p>was paranoia wrapped into her indoctrination of this too.</p>
<p>Like that Bill Gates is putting some sort of microchip in the vaccine to follow us everywhere</p>
<p>we go.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just kind of fascinating that you can have somebody that, you know,</p>
<p>is running carpool, going to Starbucks, going to exercise class, and then, you know, a few</p>
<p>months later is going bat shit crazy in Target.</p>
<p>There seems to be, particularly with QAnon, a rage associated with it that these people</p>
<p>seem to be so angry at anybody outside.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, the things that things that they taught in QAnon were true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be mad also.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be furious too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Like if what we were doing, what we thought we were doing was true in terms of changing</p>
<p>the world and building humanity, then XM would have been a great group.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t looked at Teal Swan, who&rsquo;s a woman that we haven&rsquo;t had her on because</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s a cult leader, but we&rsquo;ve had her, do you know about her?</p>
<p>I know exactly.</p>
<p>I watched the whole documentary.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So with her, it&rsquo;s interesting because people, her team has figured out SEO and the algorithm</p>
<p>so that when people are feeling low or suicidal and they type in suicide, she pops up as like</p>
<p>a person who can help.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re hooking in with her.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where cults and these groups are more dangerous.</p>
<p>I think at the same time, because of things like The Vow and all these documentaries about</p>
<p>cults and podcasts and all this awareness, people are also a little bit more aware.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think people are joining Scientology these days.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Whereas at the same time, there&rsquo;s people joining these online communities.</p>
<p>So it might be, I don&rsquo;t have the stats about what&rsquo;s actually happening.</p>
<p>What are the red flags that you find that are similar in almost all cults?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of those steps, there&rsquo;s almost always love bombing, whether it&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>or a group or whatever you&rsquo;re finding yourself in, where you feel really special, you feel</p>
<p>really loved.</p>
<p>Not to say that feeling loved and special and appreciated is you&rsquo;re in a cult because</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There should be people with good intentions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think the isolation, if you&rsquo;re being asked to sort of separate from your family and friends</p>
<p>and starting to feel like you have found the answer, anyone who&rsquo;s claiming to say that</p>
<p>they have the way or the only way or the path or all the answers, that&rsquo;s a huge red flag</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a group where you can&rsquo;t say like, wait, that doesn&rsquo;t feel right to me or that</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s BS or whatever, and without getting in trouble or shunned or cut off from</p>
<p>the group, not being able to question is a major problem.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in all parts of, there&rsquo;s lots of things right now I feel like you can&rsquo;t question,</p>
<p>which makes me feel anxious.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>I think you always have to have the free flow of information and I think having curiosity</p>
<p>or second guessing something and then being able to ask and get an answer in a transparent</p>
<p>way is paramount.</p>
<p>And business dealings and relationships, I think it&rsquo;s super important because I&rsquo;m kind</p>
<p>of a skeptic person by nature.</p>
<p>My default setting is to be kind of skeptical of things.</p>
<p>And so I always have a lot of questions if there&rsquo;s an extraordinary claim about something.</p>
<p>My instinct is, oh, come on now.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m always-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That probably protects you from a lot of things.</p>
<p>Except for pickleball.</p>
<p>Except for pickleball.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your vulnerable, that&rsquo;s your weak spot.</p>
<p>And my dogs.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, I&rsquo;m so gullible.</p>
<p>Like I believe everything anyone tells me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s a lying liar who lies a lot, I&rsquo;m your girl because I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>oh, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t question.</p>
<p>I just go with the flow.</p>
<p>So over the course of 20 years, thank goodness she&rsquo;s helped me in that regard because I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell her something.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, well, fuck, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the dumbest thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, it makes sense when you say it out loud.</p>
<p>Let me give you a prime example.</p>
<p>So Pumps, about a year ago, goes on a date with this guy that lives in Houston, right?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, this is perfect.</p>
<p>He lives in Houston.</p>
<p>I live in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>I can see him once a month.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>So this goes on for about six months.</p>
<p>They see each other a few times.</p>
<p>Well, a mutual friend of hers and the guy that she&rsquo;s dating sees an image of this man</p>
<p>on Facebook and there&rsquo;s a wedding ring on his hand.</p>
<p>So she sends it to me.</p>
<p>And I was like, he&rsquo;s married?</p>
<p>You have been having an affair?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, unbeknownst to me, and I&rsquo;m like, still, the juice that you are having</p>
<p>an affair, Pumps.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get enough of this.</p>
<p>So of course she calls and confronts him.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what he tells her.</p>
<p>He says, oh, I&rsquo;m not really married and I have been divorced for 10 years, but I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>told my coworkers.</p>
<p>So I wear the ring to work for the benefit of my coworkers because I don&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>to explain it to them.</p>
<p>So she calls me and pitches this to me, 100% the way he sold it to her.</p>
<p>She bought it, picks up the phone and calls to tell me, and she even follows up with no,</p>
<p>and I believe him.</p>
<p>And I was like, Pumps, you have got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, this guy is married.</p>
<p>You are his mistress.</p>
<p>And the big dick over of the entire thing is she didn&rsquo;t get the Chanel bag.</p>
<p>No, no mistress gifts.</p>
<p>She was the mistress and she didn&rsquo;t get jack shit, except for this song.</p>
<p>But she bought it initially.</p>
<p>Like 30 seconds.</p>
<p>And then when you said you go, if somebody came to you and told them this story, what</p>
<p>would you say?</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>And I was like, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Like, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>A lot of people come to me and they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m in this group and I researched and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all these claims, but I went to the leader and they said, that&rsquo;s just like a, you know,</p>
<p>a woman who&rsquo;s an ex, like she was in love with the leader and she&rsquo;s a woman scorned</p>
<p>or she just went crazy.</p>
<p>Those are huge red flags.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Like people, I never researched NXIVM before I went into it.</p>
<p>I only looked on day one and I was like, what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a smear campaign, which I believed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re doing good things in the world, of course, there&rsquo;s going to be haters.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So anything negative about NXIVM, I didn&rsquo;t believe from that point on, but I always encourage</p>
<p>people to research.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s questions, don&rsquo;t go to the leadership.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go to the, don&rsquo;t go to the Bishop, you know, go to people outside the group and find</p>
<p>out what happens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, but always if the, if the, if the people respond to allegations as that person just</p>
<p>went crazy or they weren&rsquo;t stable or they&rsquo;re a lover scorned, I&rsquo;m like, when there&rsquo;s smoke,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s so fascinating because when we watch that, we would, we didn&rsquo;t watch it</p>
<p>together, but we&rsquo;re watching around the same time.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d call each other because we talk on the phone all the time and she would call</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>And what I think struck me is all of you are, you know, attractive, very engaging, very</p>
<p>intelligent.</p>
<p>Like people, when I watched, I was like, I would like this person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like when I saw you, I was like, I would really like her.</p>
<p>And I think that goes to show how susceptible we all are to love bombing and a sense of</p>
<p>belonging and a sense of community and how this can gradually lead you to be a part</p>
<p>of something that is bananas.</p>
<p>But we digress because this podcast is about humor and about positivity and it&rsquo;s time for</p>
<p>us to get back to that.</p>
<p>And we need to play some games with you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Colt games.</p>
<p>Colt or not.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Am I going to get sued?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Adults that go to Disneyland without their children multiple times a year, post about</p>
<p>it, multiple posts, aka Disney adults.</p>
<p>And they have groups that they talk in, meet in, and these, I want to remind the listener</p>
<p>and remind you, Sarah, they are going to Disneyland sans children.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t know what sans is, it&rsquo;s French for without, without I&rsquo;m Canadian.</p>
<p>Can I make a caveat before we play this game?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spectrum of destruction.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s things that call to do, and this is what we talk about in our podcast,</p>
<p>a little bit culty.</p>
<p>Some things are a little culty and some things are full on cults, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They may use a couple things that a cult would use, but you can walk away from it.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to shun you.</p>
<p>That means exactly like culty, like you&rsquo;re a football club.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Disney falls into this, culty, so it&rsquo;s a little weird.</p>
<p>If you leave the group, I don&rsquo;t know what happens because I&rsquo;ve never been a Disney adult,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely strange and culty, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a cult.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So a little bit culty.</p>
<p>A little bit culty.</p>
<p>A little bit culty.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would agree with that assessment.</p>
<p>The next one are, so you&rsquo;re Canadian, but in the United States, particularly in the</p>
<p>South, universities are really big with this Greek system, sororities.</p>
<p>This one is iconic in her sorority house, allegedly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a diehard sorority person.</p>
<p>What was your sorority?</p>
<p>Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Freudian slip.</p>
<p>Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in a sorority, no big deal.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what really grinds my gears, Sarah.</p>
<p>When her daughter Emily was born, she did not have aspirations for Emily to be a CEO,</p>
<p>a brain surgeon, a human rights activist.</p>
<p>That never even entered her brain.</p>
<p>From that moment, from utero all the way now, Emily&rsquo;s 20, her number one driving goal as</p>
<p>a mother was to make Emily a Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>Emily becomes a Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>We go to Mexico every year, and all Emily does on these trips is she follows me around</p>
<p>because she knows it bugs the shit out of me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, be a Kappa, yes, yes, yes, Kappa Kappa Gamma.</p>
<p>She does all these cheers around me all the time.</p>
<p>Would you say that is a little bit culty, medium culty, or full-blown culty, and be</p>
<p>honest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s full-blown culty because I think that there are some groups</p>
<p>and some sororities that are better than others, but we actually did an episode on this.</p>
<p>I believe the sorority was Alpha, did you say Phi or Phi?</p>
<p>Phi.</p>
<p>Alpha Phi.</p>
<p>Phi.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the little firecracker of a sorority whistleblower who believes that they&rsquo;re all bad and needs</p>
<p>to be abolished, I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>I think there are probably some groups better, but I think just the structure of these young</p>
<p>women who have authority over these other young women and the way that they are meant</p>
<p>to conform and all look alike and dress alike, it&rsquo;s a concern to me.</p>
<p>If I was a mom after what I&rsquo;ve been through, it wouldn&rsquo;t be what I would choose, but you</p>
<p>had a good experience, so obviously you want that for your daughter.</p>
<p>I just think you have to be aware of, here&rsquo;s the thing, there&rsquo;s no structure in our world</p>
<p>right now, no hierarchy that isn&rsquo;t immune to abuses of power.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Sarah, you&rsquo;re saying that when your children were in utero, you weren&rsquo;t dreaming about</p>
<p>them becoming a member of a sorority.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying anybody here on this episode has done so, but I always think, I get it,</p>
<p>I was in this and I want my kid to be in this, but I mean, there was a lot of premeditation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But what I got out of it, they also have these secret handshakes that they won&rsquo;t let anybody</p>
<p>know about.</p>
<p>Culty.</p>
<p>Culty.</p>
<p>Culty, yeah.</p>
<p>But I have such good friends, like I still run around, ride or die, with seven or eight</p>
<p>of the girls that I met when I was 18 years old, and they&rsquo;ve been so helpful throughout</p>
<p>my life.</p>
<p>And we maintain closeness, like that&rsquo;s what I associate it with, not the secret handshake.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And you want that for your daughter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And just so you know, I have ride or die friends from NXIVM, and we&rsquo;ve been through a lot together</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t change that for anything.</p>
<p>I do think Pam&rsquo;s verdict is in.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually a great example because it shows that there&rsquo;s always good in all these</p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And some people can go through it.</p>
<p>Some people went through NXIVM and they said, I had a great time.</p>
<p>I learned how to do goals.</p>
<p>I learned how to communicate.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a sex cult for me.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And so I think you can have your experience and be happy that you didn&rsquo;t have a bad experience,</p>
<p>Pumps, and also still say, but there are problems with the system.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s a way to have it in a way that&rsquo;s safe and to have like adults oversee</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But the way that I see it now, it&rsquo;s really unhealthy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I would die on that cross.</p>
<p>I really would.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we really want to be popular in Canada and Canada doesn&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t like us.</p>
<p>So what can, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re asking you.</p>
<p>What can we do to bring on more Canadians?</p>
<p>Do we just reek of Americans?</p>
<p>Is it our accents?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely the accent I think is.</p>
<p>Do I have the accent or is it her?</p>
<p>I have a terrible one.</p>
<p>You both, you both do.</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, maybe one of you needs to go brunette.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like my hair is too much blonde.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re way darker hair than me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;d be you.</p>
<p>Why are you sacrificing me?</p>
<p>Because your hair by nature is darker than me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I want, okay.</p>
<p>Before I forget, you mentioned on an episode that you&rsquo;ve had it with mega churches.</p>
<p>Oh, I have up to my eyeballs.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that you&rsquo;ve watched the TV series, Righteous Gemstones.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all over it.</p>
<p>Every episode.</p>
<p>It is so good, Sarah.</p>
<p>It is so good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not acting anymore, but if I were to act, it would be on that show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to put it out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so smart.</p>
<p>It is so good.</p>
<p>And it is so culty.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so culty.</p>
<p>It is so culty.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sarah, I cannot thank you enough.</p>
<p>I cannot believe it&rsquo;s like touch us because we watched The Vow and then here you are on</p>
<p>our little podcast and we cannot thank you enough for joining us.</p>
<p>It has meant the world to us and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this so much.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sarah.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Sarah, tell our listeners where to find you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can find me on Instagram, Sarah Edmondson and a little bit culty, both of those handles</p>
<p>are on Instagram.</p>
<p>I also have my own website, sarahedmondson.com and there&rsquo;s great resources on there.</p>
<p>If you feel like you might be in a cult or you need to recover from a cult, you can get</p>
<p>all sorts of therapy and references there.</p>
<p>And your book, Scarred, is on hard copy, digital and audio books, correct?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I narrated the audible, which is kind of cool because you get to have my voice in</p>
<p>your ear for nine hours.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sarah.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks, Sarah.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Take care, ladies.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Love Sarah Edmondson.</p>
<p>Love her.</p>
<p>I think that this is something that you really need to take a look into is this cult activity</p>
<p>of yours and indoctrinating your daughter into it because we have, I mean, basically</p>
<p>everybody in the room kind of felt it was culty, the expert.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there&rsquo;s like panties in the initiation.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some weird ass shit going on.</p>
<p>And pumps.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re just jealous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to do is go hang out with 200 women at a time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m chomping at the bit to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my worst fucking nightmare.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But I just loved it.</p>
<p>I mean, like love, love, love, love, love, love, love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how people feel that are in cults.</p>
<p>They love it.</p>
<p>Scientologists, you know what they do with their kids?</p>
<p>They put them in a boat.</p>
<p>They make them be Scientologists.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Emily is.</p>
<p>Makes me so happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s culty.</p>
<p>Culty.</p>
<p>Hey, follow us on all platforms, TikTok, Instagram, like, subscribe, rate, and if you want, write</p>
<p>a review and DM us a voice memo of what you&rsquo;ve had it with and DM us some stuff about cults.</p>
<p>If you were in a cult, keep them 30 seconds or less.</p>
<p>DM to our Instagram at I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>Other than that, we will see you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday, everyone.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
