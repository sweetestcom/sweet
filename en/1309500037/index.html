<p>the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes</p>
<p>strong language and</p>
<p>adult dialogue</p>
<p>viewer discretion</p>
<p>is advised wow</p>
<p>this story&rsquo;s got it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just get</p>
<p>right into it today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story takes</p>
<p>place in toyota florida</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start off with just the family in general there</p>
<p>are kind of a lot of</p>
<p>names that can get a bit confusing but bear with me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try my best</p>
<p>so margaret and chad amato</p>
<p>they had three sons and they</p>
<p>lived in juliota florida like i had said the oldest son</p>
<p>jason wasn&rsquo;t chad&rsquo;s biological</p>
<p>son but chad</p>
<p>adopted him</p>
<p>at the age of</p>
<p>three and cared for him</p>
<p>as his own so</p>
<p>jason considered chad to be his father and soon</p>
<p>after margaret and chad got</p>
<p>married and then</p>
<p>had two more sons</p>
<p>so they went on to have cody</p>
<p>who was the middle son and then</p>
<p>grant who was the youngest</p>
<p>all three boys were said to grow up really close</p>
<p>and they did</p>
<p>everything together</p>
<p>they were big into</p>
<p>sports played outside went to football games and</p>
<p>seemed to just have like a really</p>
<p>great relationship</p>
<p>i mean so it seems you know</p>
<p>you never know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on behind</p>
<p>closed doors but it just</p>
<p>sounded like</p>
<p>it was good so margaret and chad</p>
<p>they provided a pretty good life</p>
<p>yeah a very good life i</p>
<p>would say because they</p>
<p>lived in this big beautiful ass</p>
<p>house they seem to be doing financially well</p>
<p>they had this big home they had nice cars</p>
<p>they had gaming</p>
<p>systems computers</p>
<p>i mean all the materialistic</p>
<p>stuff it seemed</p>
<p>you know that they had it all</p>
<p>must i say more no</p>
<p>margaret the mom she</p>
<p>loved horses</p>
<p>she adopted</p>
<p>a retired racehorse</p>
<p>she had like a stable</p>
<p>she kept the</p>
<p>horses and she</p>
<p>would go down to the</p>
<p>stables and work with her</p>
<p>horse she was very passionate</p>
<p>about horses</p>
<p>and if she wasn&rsquo;t inside the home</p>
<p>then you could find her down at the</p>
<p>stable margaret</p>
<p>worked for a health care company</p>
<p>as a client operations manager</p>
<p>and her husband chad was a clinical pharmacist</p>
<p>at a local cvs</p>
<p>but he also had a second job</p>
<p>hobby working on computers and</p>
<p>building computers as well</p>
<p>growing up it was said that the home was pretty loving</p>
<p>but chad their dad</p>
<p>could be very</p>
<p>strong very old</p>
<p>school type of guy you know</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>never any physical</p>
<p>abuse going on in the home</p>
<p>but also it was just like you didn&rsquo;t want to piss</p>
<p>chat off you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna piss your dad off he was just stricter</p>
<p>and he had rules</p>
<p>that you had to follow and if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna follow his rules</p>
<p>then you could get out you know</p>
<p>so the oldest son</p>
<p>jason he ended up moving out when he was</p>
<p>19 years old around that</p>
<p>age he would go on to</p>
<p>start his own family as well he said that he was</p>
<p>still really close</p>
<p>to his family he</p>
<p>would visit the home</p>
<p>on holidays he was always welcome and he</p>
<p>tried to be around when he</p>
<p>could but again he had his own life in his own family</p>
<p>so it was just</p>
<p>every so often</p>
<p>during their high</p>
<p>school years cody and</p>
<p>grant were set to do</p>
<p>everything together</p>
<p>cody was only one year</p>
<p>older than grant so they were pretty</p>
<p>close in age</p>
<p>they both were</p>
<p>like on the weightlifting team together at their high</p>
<p>school they played</p>
<p>video games together they</p>
<p>built their own computers together yeah</p>
<p>learning from</p>
<p>like how to do so from</p>
<p>their father</p>
<p>cause their father did the same thing</p>
<p>also the family</p>
<p>everyone seemed to own</p>
<p>their own guns</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>a big gun family it seemed like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but they all had</p>
<p>their own guns and they</p>
<p>often went to like the</p>
<p>shooting range together</p>
<p>and both cody and grant</p>
<p>also started</p>
<p>their own airsoft league</p>
<p>now it was said that</p>
<p>grant the youngest</p>
<p>he was a bit of a</p>
<p>loner he was kind of like the odd ball</p>
<p>well cody seemed to be like his only friend</p>
<p>any friends</p>
<p>that were cody&rsquo;s friends though</p>
<p>were grant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends but it seemed like</p>
<p>those friends</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily just invite</p>
<p>grant out you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m saying like it was that type of deal where</p>
<p>grant seemed to rely on cody to</p>
<p>provide friends</p>
<p>so grant the youngest</p>
<p>he went on to attend</p>
<p>ucf and then</p>
<p>in 2011 he got his nursing degree</p>
<p>and he wanted to get into the medical</p>
<p>fields like</p>
<p>pretty much the rest of his family</p>
<p>cause all of his family at this</p>
<p>point was working in the medical field</p>
<p>so then in 2018</p>
<p>grant was then</p>
<p>29 he was either 28 29 at the time but he</p>
<p>was fired from the hospital</p>
<p>that he was working at</p>
<p>because mm hmm</p>
<p>grant he was accused of stealing</p>
<p>eight vials of propofol</p>
<p>a heavy duty</p>
<p>sedative that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>typically used during surgery</p>
<p>grant was caught</p>
<p>caught with</p>
<p>eight vials of it like in his pocket like he was</p>
<p>gonna take it home</p>
<p>party or something we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>grant was caught</p>
<p>and he was arrested</p>
<p>and in the arrest report it said that grant</p>
<p>admitted to</p>
<p>stealing the drug to give to patients that he felt were</p>
<p>not being adequately</p>
<p>sedated by doctor</p>
<p>ordered medication</p>
<p>he was arrested and</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>grand theft</p>
<p>but in november the charges were</p>
<p>dropped it&rsquo;s believed that the charges were</p>
<p>dropped because</p>
<p>grant was claiming that he was giving this</p>
<p>medication to</p>
<p>other patients at the hospital</p>
<p>which potentially</p>
<p>could open up</p>
<p>lawsuits against</p>
<p>the hospital if it were true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that</p>
<p>grant wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually giving</p>
<p>this to his patients that he was actually just</p>
<p>going to take it home and use it himself</p>
<p>but there isn&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>proof of that so it was just</p>
<p>completely dropped because</p>
<p>potentially it</p>
<p>could open up</p>
<p>lawsuits and all that jazz</p>
<p>and all that jazz</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it always comes down to</p>
<p>money lawsuits</p>
<p>not about the</p>
<p>right thing huh</p>
<p>so at this time when</p>
<p>grant gets fired he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still living with his mom and dad</p>
<p>and again he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 28 29</p>
<p>and then also cody is</p>
<p>still living with</p>
<p>his parents as well so it&rsquo;s cody</p>
<p>grant margaret and</p>
<p>chad all living together</p>
<p>under one roof okay</p>
<p>now his family</p>
<p>is just very</p>
<p>upset with him</p>
<p>disappointed with him obviously</p>
<p>it became a very heated</p>
<p>topic when the family</p>
<p>would push him ask him</p>
<p>questions like when are you</p>
<p>gonna get a job</p>
<p>you know parents</p>
<p>asking questions like when am i</p>
<p>gonna get a job</p>
<p>but they would get into an</p>
<p>argument because</p>
<p>grant just kind of fell</p>
<p>into what seemed to be</p>
<p>depression he didn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>motivated at all</p>
<p>to get a new</p>
<p>job yeah anytime his parents brought it up it</p>
<p>would just start a</p>
<p>fight the parents seemed to just kind of be a little</p>
<p>getting frustrated with</p>
<p>grant because he&rsquo;s living rent free you know</p>
<p>has no job and</p>
<p>everyone was paying for whatever</p>
<p>grant needed at that time</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>asked they would just give him money</p>
<p>when grandparents</p>
<p>would refuse to give him</p>
<p>money he would ask his brother cody who</p>
<p>and was the</p>
<p>older brother</p>
<p>and often times cody</p>
<p>would give him</p>
<p>money for anything that he needed</p>
<p>so pretty much everybody was</p>
<p>taking care of grant</p>
<p>while he was trying to find a job now grant</p>
<p>spent a lot of his time on his computer</p>
<p>computer or gaming and he was home all the time</p>
<p>with like nothing to do because he didn&rsquo;t have a job</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s like a lonely</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a lonely person looking for some</p>
<p>sweet loving gonna do</p>
<p>you know well</p>
<p>he found his way to a website called myfreakam</p>
<p>com not sponsored</p>
<p>it was an x</p>
<p>rated website where you</p>
<p>could chat with or even just</p>
<p>view different cam girls and pay for like one on one</p>
<p>video sex chat</p>
<p>boom kind of website</p>
<p>now if you don&rsquo;t know what a cam girl website is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great question a cam girl website is</p>
<p>where women</p>
<p>even men too don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong can go on</p>
<p>there and like you can just be like all sexy and like</p>
<p>and then people can pay you to</p>
<p>chat with you and it&rsquo;s really up to the cam girl or guy</p>
<p>how far they</p>
<p>wanna go like if whether it be</p>
<p>like some sexual</p>
<p>stuff or if it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>pg 13 it&rsquo;s all up to them but it can get</p>
<p>you know way more x rated</p>
<p>as they say</p>
<p>so grant is on there</p>
<p>right when he&rsquo;s looking around</p>
<p>he finds this woman</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a cam</p>
<p>model and her name is sylvie</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>bulgaria sylvie</p>
<p>now grant fell in love with</p>
<p>sylvie okay</p>
<p>she was beautiful she was</p>
<p>smart plus she</p>
<p>would make him feel special now</p>
<p>grant would</p>
<p>keep coming back to</p>
<p>see sylvie on the website they</p>
<p>would talk for</p>
<p>hours and grant</p>
<p>just felt like he was</p>
<p>truly in an intimate relationship with this</p>
<p>woman sylvie he told</p>
<p>sylvie that he was a very</p>
<p>successful professional gamer</p>
<p>and that he</p>
<p>drove a fancy bmw</p>
<p>and he was living in his own</p>
<p>apartment creating a new persona</p>
<p>for himself online</p>
<p>i mean why not you know</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lying or not</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>grant would</p>
<p>spend hours upon</p>
<p>hours online</p>
<p>watching sylvie</p>
<p>model and dance online</p>
<p>he would also get one on one time with sylvie</p>
<p>where she would</p>
<p>model for him and</p>
<p>or do sexual</p>
<p>things online</p>
<p>while grant was</p>
<p>watching now</p>
<p>grant would pay</p>
<p>in order to</p>
<p>watch or have one on one time with her but he felt</p>
<p>the more money he</p>
<p>spent with this new persona he was</p>
<p>you know putting out there</p>
<p>the more attention he was receiving from sylvie</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure this</p>
<p>attention was just nice it&rsquo;s probably felt nice</p>
<p>somebody likes me you know</p>
<p>grant said that in</p>
<p>order to watch</p>
<p>sylvie it costed 90 tokens per minute and</p>
<p>grant had purchased</p>
<p>5 000 tokens</p>
<p>for 600 math</p>
<p>which means he</p>
<p>would get about an hour or 56 minutes of</p>
<p>sylvie&rsquo;s time for 600</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the wrong business</p>
<p>as their relationship continued</p>
<p>grant would mail</p>
<p>sylvie sex toys</p>
<p>or lingerie</p>
<p>that she would</p>
<p>model for him</p>
<p>and at first</p>
<p>grant was spending about</p>
<p>four hours a</p>
<p>night watching sylvie</p>
<p>which was costing him</p>
<p>about 2 500</p>
<p>a day in november of</p>
<p>2019 bank statements showed that</p>
<p>grant was spending up to 20 000 a</p>
<p>night sending this</p>
<p>money to sylvie and tips</p>
<p>while he watched</p>
<p>20 000 a night</p>
<p>rant was just growing more</p>
<p>and more out of control like this is just</p>
<p>sounds like a full</p>
<p>blown addiction</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>wondering well how the hell was he getting his</p>
<p>money cause he didn&rsquo;t have he didn&rsquo;t have a job</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t working and he was dedicating a lot</p>
<p>of his time to just</p>
<p>watching sylvie</p>
<p>so it was said</p>
<p>that he was getting the</p>
<p>money from his parents credit cards and also by hacking</p>
<p>their bank accounts or his brother cody</p>
<p>would give him</p>
<p>money from time to time nobody really knew what it was</p>
<p>going towards but</p>
<p>yeah now it&rsquo;s unclear at what</p>
<p>point grant&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>had caught on</p>
<p>but it was said that chad and margaret had confronted</p>
<p>grant about</p>
<p>these like 600</p>
<p>charges that they were seeing in</p>
<p>their bank accounts and</p>
<p>grant had told his</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>spending the</p>
<p>money on twitch</p>
<p>promoting his account so he</p>
<p>would grow in followers and subscribers</p>
<p>and in the long run that it</p>
<p>would pay off because if you are a</p>
<p>video game streamer</p>
<p>i mean i think they make a lot of</p>
<p>money right</p>
<p>so grant&rsquo;s mother father and his brother</p>
<p>they knew that he was like</p>
<p>stealing and</p>
<p>spending a large</p>
<p>amount of money</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re unsure</p>
<p>if they knew</p>
<p>what exactly it was for like what the</p>
<p>truth was but anytime it was brought up it was just</p>
<p>again like a heated</p>
<p>topic cody tried to be the calm one in the family</p>
<p>he tried to tell</p>
<p>grant hey i&rsquo;ll be here and i&rsquo;ll help you in any way</p>
<p>and i can help you</p>
<p>pay everybody back and</p>
<p>he was just the one who seemed to be trying to keep the</p>
<p>peace in the family</p>
<p>and keep everybody calm</p>
<p>cody just seemed like he was always trying to protect</p>
<p>grant so earlier i said that</p>
<p>the parents had looked at their bank</p>
<p>statements from</p>
<p>2019 it was from 2018 sorry</p>
<p>in december of 2018</p>
<p>grant and his brother cody</p>
<p>plus a friend</p>
<p>named jericho they went to or they went on a trip to</p>
<p>japan the group was really into</p>
<p>anime and was looking forward to</p>
<p>going and seeing the</p>
<p>art the culture</p>
<p>and just anime</p>
<p>i believe there was like a</p>
<p>studio out there that they were an animation</p>
<p>studio that they were really</p>
<p>excited about but</p>
<p>they all went now because</p>
<p>grant had no</p>
<p>money cody his brother</p>
<p>ended up covering all costs for him to go i know</p>
<p>it was said that the last day that they were in japan</p>
<p>grant told cody</p>
<p>and his friend</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feeling very well and that he wanted to stay behind</p>
<p>while the two</p>
<p>other went out to kind of</p>
<p>adventure around a little bit before they left</p>
<p>so later on</p>
<p>it was discovered that</p>
<p>grant actually had taken or</p>
<p>stolen i should say</p>
<p>their friend jericho&rsquo;s credit card</p>
<p>and he went to a</p>
<p>place with wi fi</p>
<p>and used the card to pay</p>
<p>and watch sylvie</p>
<p>while the other two were away the friend</p>
<p>allegedly i</p>
<p>should say he didn&rsquo;t notice</p>
<p>that the card was gone</p>
<p>until he got a notification or a</p>
<p>phone call from his parent asking like why are you</p>
<p>charging this</p>
<p>this large amount</p>
<p>cause it was like 600</p>
<p>why are you</p>
<p>like what is this charge</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they realized that grant</p>
<p>had taken his card i mean</p>
<p>he sounds like a drug addict</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s just got to get his</p>
<p>sylvie fix now when the brothers had returned home</p>
<p>things got heated</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s father was</p>
<p>disappointed that grant</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t have a job</p>
<p>and that he wasn&rsquo;t really doing anything with his life</p>
<p>except for spending everybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money and putting everyone into debt</p>
<p>at the end of december of 2018</p>
<p>their father chad was</p>
<p>looking at his bank records</p>
<p>again and discovered that a lot more</p>
<p>money was missing</p>
<p>which he then</p>
<p>asked grant</p>
<p>about it and it led to an argument now grant</p>
<p>ended up leaving the home</p>
<p>that day and he just kind of</p>
<p>drove off into the</p>
<p>night right</p>
<p>and this was on december 19th of 2018</p>
<p>his mother called 911</p>
<p>and she expressed that you know she was</p>
<p>worried about him because he seemed really depressed</p>
<p>and she believed that he may have been</p>
<p>possibly suicidal</p>
<p>margaret then</p>
<p>told the police that she had received a text from</p>
<p>grant saying</p>
<p>quote i&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>tired of everything just</p>
<p>going to handle it my own way end</p>
<p>quote grant</p>
<p>ended up driving out to his aunt&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>too far it was in florida i</p>
<p>think it was an</p>
<p>orange county</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>sorry but he</p>
<p>ended up driving out to his</p>
<p>aunt&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>he asked if he</p>
<p>could stay there with her and she agreed she let him in</p>
<p>his aunt said that he seemed very depressed</p>
<p>she had noticed that he just seemed like he was lost</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>she also noticed that</p>
<p>grant would be asleep all day</p>
<p>and then stay up all</p>
<p>night his aunt and</p>
<p>uncle they also had guns in the home</p>
<p>and they thought it</p>
<p>would be best</p>
<p>if they took the guns they locked him up at</p>
<p>least for while</p>
<p>grant was staying</p>
<p>there because he just seemed very down</p>
<p>so a few days</p>
<p>go by and his aunt looks at</p>
<p>her bank account and what does she see yes</p>
<p>grant again what the hell are you doing she sees all</p>
<p>these weird charges</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re for hundreds of dollars</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recognize them and then that&rsquo;s when she finds out that</p>
<p>grant had stolen her credit card information and was</p>
<p>using it to pay and watch</p>
<p>sylvie at night</p>
<p>while the family was asleep</p>
<p>like what the heck are you doing you know</p>
<p>also it was said that grant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uncle grandma</p>
<p>and one of his cousins</p>
<p>all had charges on</p>
<p>their cards</p>
<p>again from grant to</p>
<p>watch sylvie</p>
<p>so he was just hacking</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bank account at</p>
<p>least in his family it seems so</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s aunt calls up</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>his name is chad remember</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>listen he stole</p>
<p>my credit card information and</p>
<p>have these weird charges and she&rsquo;s telling them</p>
<p>everything right and then that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s father just had</p>
<p>a full blown</p>
<p>breakdown and cried on the</p>
<p>phone telling her that</p>
<p>this has been</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>the family was in</p>
<p>150 000 dollars</p>
<p>worth of debt</p>
<p>that was caused</p>
<p>by grants spending on</p>
<p>this website or whatever</p>
<p>150 000 dollars</p>
<p>in debt chad told</p>
<p>her over the</p>
<p>phone that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he would be able to retire for years but</p>
<p>that it was okay</p>
<p>because he wanted to do it for</p>
<p>grant and he didn&rsquo;t want him to go to jail</p>
<p>asked her to please not</p>
<p>press charges</p>
<p>and chad promised that he</p>
<p>would pay her back any of the</p>
<p>money that was made from</p>
<p>grant grant had</p>
<p>stolen between</p>
<p>two hundred to two hundred and</p>
<p>fifty thousand dollars</p>
<p>from the family</p>
<p>just so he could interact with</p>
<p>sylvie online</p>
<p>so it was like a hundred and</p>
<p>fifty thousand</p>
<p>just from his family</p>
<p>alone and then from his immediate family</p>
<p>and then his aunt</p>
<p>uncle grandma</p>
<p>grandpa like</p>
<p>everybody else was getting hit around him too</p>
<p>and grant he had a</p>
<p>problem and the family didn&rsquo;t want him to go to prison</p>
<p>they knew he needed help and not prison</p>
<p>so the family mom dad</p>
<p>cody and their</p>
<p>older brother jason</p>
<p>they all came up with a plan</p>
<p>to confront</p>
<p>grant at their</p>
<p>aunt&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and have like a little intervention</p>
<p>the family showed</p>
<p>up and then they waited outside of the aunt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and then once grant</p>
<p>leaves the home</p>
<p>he was walking out like he&rsquo;s walking back to his car</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they all confront him</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>either taking him to a</p>
<p>treatment facility</p>
<p>or he was going to be cut off from the family</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re telling him</p>
<p>hey man we think that you have a problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>stealing everybody&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>and we just</p>
<p>wanna help you and we don&rsquo;t want you to go to prison</p>
<p>so please just go to this</p>
<p>treatment facility</p>
<p>get some help</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>will definitely help you</p>
<p>the family just seemed very supportive</p>
<p>and gave him</p>
<p>so many chances</p>
<p>they just wanted to help him</p>
<p>now it was said that grant</p>
<p>was the quiet</p>
<p>submissive type and</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t really say anything when this happened</p>
<p>he was just kind of like okay yeah you</p>
<p>know and that he voluntarily</p>
<p>went to the rehab</p>
<p>clinic in south florida</p>
<p>now this clinic</p>
<p>is mainly for</p>
<p>people with addiction drug addiction and whatnot but</p>
<p>i mean there really aren&rsquo;t many clinics that focus</p>
<p>strictly on like internet addiction</p>
<p>so okay he agrees cool so they</p>
<p>drive them out there they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yes this is gonna be</p>
<p>great you know</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s gonna change</p>
<p>yippee ki yay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go so they</p>
<p>drive him out there to the facility</p>
<p>and the family pays 15 000 dollars</p>
<p>for him to receive 60</p>
<p>days of treatment</p>
<p>and then they all just kind of went back home</p>
<p>cody and chad</p>
<p>chad&rsquo;s the father</p>
<p>cody is the old the middle</p>
<p>child remember but they were able to hack into grant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>computer back at the</p>
<p>house and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they saw like this fake life that</p>
<p>grant was living online</p>
<p>this is when they find out the whole</p>
<p>truth you know</p>
<p>so they saw that</p>
<p>grant was claiming to be a successful</p>
<p>gamer who lived</p>
<p>alone had nice cars and just</p>
<p>where all this money was</p>
<p>going this is why i can&rsquo;t be a parent</p>
<p>cause i would lose my shit</p>
<p>well they decide just to take matters into</p>
<p>their own hand you know let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>reach out to all of</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>and reach out to this</p>
<p>sylvie lady and</p>
<p>tell her the</p>
<p>truth so they did just that</p>
<p>they go on there they message everybody</p>
<p>when grant went to go talk to sylvie</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost like a community there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>handful of people who</p>
<p>were very loyal to sylvie</p>
<p>and were always there when she went live</p>
<p>and they all kind of became friends</p>
<p>they shared this interest in</p>
<p>sylvie and kind of had a connection</p>
<p>about that i guess</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really sure but he became</p>
<p>friends with the people who also viewed sylvie so</p>
<p>cody and chad</p>
<p>they message everybody</p>
<p>and pretty much tell them the</p>
<p>truth saying that</p>
<p>grant had been</p>
<p>lying that he actually</p>
<p>lived at home he had no job he had a basic</p>
<p>vehicle they told</p>
<p>sylvie that</p>
<p>grant had been giving her stolen</p>
<p>money from the family</p>
<p>and that they were no longer allowed to contact each</p>
<p>other grant&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>treatment and he&rsquo;s there for two weeks</p>
<p>after two weeks</p>
<p>grant leaves the</p>
<p>treatment center</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cured he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fixed i&rsquo;m healed</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;m all good now</p>
<p>grant apparently</p>
<p>allegedly he went to the</p>
<p>treatment center and was just telling them</p>
<p>everything that they wanted to hear pretty much the</p>
<p>treatment center said that they really couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything for him</p>
<p>so they just kinda</p>
<p>they let him go</p>
<p>after two weeks</p>
<p>grant goes back to the family home</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know why the family allowed him to come back home</p>
<p>but they did and you know we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>judge we&rsquo;re not them</p>
<p>so on january</p>
<p>5th grant comes back home</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s allowed to stay there but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have some new rules that</p>
<p>chad his dad put in place</p>
<p>so chad and</p>
<p>grant sat down</p>
<p>and he gave</p>
<p>grant some ultimatums like</p>
<p>you can either live in my</p>
<p>house and follow my rules</p>
<p>or you could</p>
<p>leave move out or just</p>
<p>join the military</p>
<p>you know if you stay in my home</p>
<p>then you are no longer allowed to have a cell phone</p>
<p>and if you do have a cell</p>
<p>phone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to have one that has internet access</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just like a little flip</p>
<p>phone or something you know</p>
<p>grant would not be allowed to use the internet</p>
<p>at night and they were</p>
<p>going to take away his computer out of his room</p>
<p>also that he needed to get a job and</p>
<p>start paying off some of the debts that he owed</p>
<p>this is what chad is telling</p>
<p>grant which</p>
<p>sounds like what most parents</p>
<p>would do a lot of people</p>
<p>do do this usually to like a</p>
<p>teenager you know but</p>
<p>grant is almost 30 years old</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>come on grant get it together man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an adult</p>
<p>get it together</p>
<p>now the biggest and the most</p>
<p>upsetting rule</p>
<p>grant was going to have to cut</p>
<p>all ties with</p>
<p>sylvi like it</p>
<p>was done he was not allowed to contact her</p>
<p>so when chad tells</p>
<p>grant like you can&rsquo;t talk to</p>
<p>sylvi anymore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at the moment when he informs</p>
<p>grant like hey we actually contacted her</p>
<p>mm hmm and we told her the truth</p>
<p>and in my mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the moment that really just set</p>
<p>grant off and probably just i mean that</p>
<p>would be just embarrassing and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>angry cause he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s in love with this woman</p>
<p>so chad is trying to explain to</p>
<p>grant that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally putting a stranger that you&rsquo;ve never met</p>
<p>over your own family and that now</p>
<p>the family is financially struggling because of this</p>
<p>i just trying to get through to</p>
<p>grant like open his eyes like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth it what are you doing we&rsquo;re trying to help you</p>
<p>now grant agreed to</p>
<p>these rules in</p>
<p>order to stay in the house</p>
<p>it was said that margaret</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she was more sad</p>
<p>because her son like</p>
<p>her baby she seemed to have like a soft spot for grant</p>
<p>but time went on and grant</p>
<p>was seeming to follow the rules</p>
<p>just trying to</p>
<p>get his life together but it didn&rsquo;t really last long i</p>
<p>guess grant</p>
<p>would go to margaret his</p>
<p>mother ask if he</p>
<p>could use her phone</p>
<p>because her</p>
<p>phone could access</p>
<p>internet and margaret</p>
<p>would allow him to use her</p>
<p>phone and talk to</p>
<p>sylvie on twitter</p>
<p>on january twenty fourth chad</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>grant was using his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s phone to</p>
<p>still talk to sylvie</p>
<p>and told him that</p>
<p>he needed to get out that he had ruined his retirement</p>
<p>and to just</p>
<p>leave chad then left for work</p>
<p>grant is said that he was</p>
<p>you know packing like a</p>
<p>small bag because he was</p>
<p>gonna leave</p>
<p>and then cody was at work as well</p>
<p>receiving text messages</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on back at home</p>
<p>because there was like an argument</p>
<p>around 9 15 pm cody</p>
<p>was done with his</p>
<p>shift at work he told his</p>
<p>girlfriend that he had to go home and</p>
<p>quote deal with</p>
<p>stupid shit end quote</p>
<p>aka the family</p>
<p>drama thing that was happening and</p>
<p>he went home</p>
<p>on friday january 25th</p>
<p>2019 the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>got a call from one of cody&rsquo;s friends and co workers</p>
<p>he told a dispatcher that</p>
<p>he was concerned because cody hadn&rsquo;t showed up for work</p>
<p>plus cody wasn&rsquo;t responding to any text messages</p>
<p>and according to this friend</p>
<p>who had worked with and</p>
<p>known cody for years said that cody always had his</p>
<p>phone on him</p>
<p>and that in the years that he knew him</p>
<p>never came late to work so it was just strange that</p>
<p>cody wouldn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>police went out to the home to perform a welfare</p>
<p>check at 9 17 am</p>
<p>they knock on the door</p>
<p>and they get no answer</p>
<p>the cars were in the driveway</p>
<p>and they also</p>
<p>noticed that all the windows downstairs were</p>
<p>covered with</p>
<p>paper so you couldn&rsquo;t even see in the windows</p>
<p>they were able to use a</p>
<p>knife and open</p>
<p>the lock on the door to the master bedroom</p>
<p>and then the police</p>
<p>walk into the home and then they see</p>
<p>the body of chad</p>
<p>lying on his back on the</p>
<p>kitchen floor with</p>
<p>blood just all around him</p>
<p>there was a pool of</p>
<p>dried blood in two different areas of the kitchen</p>
<p>and also what seemed to</p>
<p>be like claw marks through the</p>
<p>smeared blood</p>
<p>as if he was trying to</p>
<p>crawl his way</p>
<p>across the floor</p>
<p>to get somewhere maybe get</p>
<p>to the phone</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not sure but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>photos i wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there was chicken on the</p>
<p>counter defrosting and chad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lunch box was on the floor</p>
<p>it seemed like</p>
<p>maybe chad had just gotten home from work</p>
<p>he went to the</p>
<p>kitchen to unpack his</p>
<p>lunch bag take out the chicken</p>
<p>maybe and start dinner</p>
<p>when he was shot from behind</p>
<p>he also had a gun and</p>
<p>holster on his</p>
<p>right hip they continue</p>
<p>searching around the</p>
<p>house and they find margaret in her office</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>in her chair and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>slumped over on top of her computer</p>
<p>she had a glass of wine</p>
<p>on the desk and her computer was open and she</p>
<p>was shot from behind</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m sorry and</p>
<p>she was dead same with</p>
<p>chad as well</p>
<p>they also find cody who was</p>
<p>dressed in his work</p>
<p>scrubs laying on the</p>
<p>floor by the door to the garage</p>
<p>he also had been shot</p>
<p>and was dead there was also a backpack near him</p>
<p>and there were</p>
<p>two different handguns laying</p>
<p>about five feet away from cody and four</p>
<p>bullet casings were</p>
<p>found on the ground as well at first</p>
<p>it appeared to be a murder suicide</p>
<p>that cody may have shot his</p>
<p>mother father and then himself</p>
<p>but once the</p>
<p>crime scene was looked at more closely</p>
<p>they had reason to believe that this was indeed</p>
<p>not a murder suicide police had come out to the home</p>
<p>previously and they knew that there was another son</p>
<p>grant who lived there</p>
<p>but he was nowhere to be</p>
<p>found that day the next</p>
<p>day a saturday</p>
<p>they were able to</p>
<p>track down grant&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>at a double tree</p>
<p>hotel in orange</p>
<p>county florida</p>
<p>and police were able to find</p>
<p>which room grant was in</p>
<p>and they knock on the door</p>
<p>to get grant</p>
<p>and on police body cam footage</p>
<p>you can see</p>
<p>grant like crawling</p>
<p>on the ground when police come in</p>
<p>and he turns around he&rsquo;s on his knees</p>
<p>he turns around</p>
<p>to be handcuffed at this time they had no</p>
<p>no evidence on</p>
<p>grant there was no fingerprints</p>
<p>found there was no dna</p>
<p>linking to like a killer at all</p>
<p>there was no murder weapon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that whoever had done this</p>
<p>made sure to</p>
<p>lean up afterwards and then</p>
<p>stage the scene</p>
<p>so grant wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>under arrest he was just being</p>
<p>taken in for questioning</p>
<p>and so grant goes in for questioning and he</p>
<p>would be there for over seven</p>
<p>hours just talking to investigators</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on within the last few</p>
<p>months the problems they were having and the</p>
<p>money problems</p>
<p>pretty much just</p>
<p>everything we talked</p>
<p>about right now</p>
<p>he was really honest</p>
<p>well but he was he was like honest</p>
<p>about the money and the girl and</p>
<p>stuff he didn&rsquo;t try and like make anything up but</p>
<p>he told investigators that</p>
<p>chad had confronted him</p>
<p>about sylvie on the</p>
<p>night of the 24th</p>
<p>and that chad told him he needed to</p>
<p>leave the house</p>
<p>grant said that he packed a bag and then he left</p>
<p>the house but before he left</p>
<p>cody had stopped him</p>
<p>and said that he</p>
<p>would promise to take care of</p>
<p>their parents and try to calm down the situation</p>
<p>grant told investigators</p>
<p>that when he left everyone was</p>
<p>alive and fine</p>
<p>grant was trying to set it up to investigators in a way</p>
<p>that made it</p>
<p>sound like cody was</p>
<p>going to talk to the parents</p>
<p>and then he left the</p>
<p>house and he had no idea what happened after that</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s suggesting like i don&rsquo;t know and</p>
<p>cody said he was</p>
<p>gonna deal with it</p>
<p>and you can actually</p>
<p>watch the full questioning</p>
<p>video on youtube but here&rsquo;s the kicker</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the kicker</p>
<p>grant grant</p>
<p>some of us are pretty observant</p>
<p>okay and we noticed something</p>
<p>grant he&rsquo;s claiming that he left the</p>
<p>house and nothing to do with anything</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s like i left</p>
<p>everyone was</p>
<p>alive i don&rsquo;t know well then grant</p>
<p>how come in those</p>
<p>hours of questioning</p>
<p>not once did</p>
<p>grant ask hey why am i here</p>
<p>what what happened to my family why are you asking me</p>
<p>about why are you asking questions in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s trying to give off this</p>
<p>impression that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely innocent</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>been told what happened to his family yet</p>
<p>okay so and</p>
<p>grant if you&rsquo;re so innocent</p>
<p>why wasn&rsquo;t when police came into the</p>
<p>hotel you automatically got on your knees</p>
<p>and turned around to be arrested</p>
<p>if he knew what happened to his family</p>
<p>i would assume that you would</p>
<p>not ask questions</p>
<p>as far as like why am i here and</p>
<p>stuff but if you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>your first question</p>
<p>would be like what the</p>
<p>hell why am i here why are you why are you why are you</p>
<p>knocking at my</p>
<p>hotel door stupid</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a stupid ass</p>
<p>yeah grant didn&rsquo;t even ask</p>
<p>about halfway</p>
<p>into the interrogation</p>
<p>is when finally one of the detectives pulls out</p>
<p>photos of the</p>
<p>crime scene shows it to</p>
<p>grant asking him</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s you know how he left the house</p>
<p>is that how your</p>
<p>mother looked</p>
<p>and like shows him a</p>
<p>picture of his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s body and</p>
<p>he does again like or what</p>
<p>about chad and cody</p>
<p>and shows grant</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>their bodies and</p>
<p>the whole gory scene</p>
<p>and grant appears to be very upset but</p>
<p>claims that he had nothing to do with this</p>
<p>grant said that the family had been blaming him for</p>
<p>months for ruining</p>
<p>their lives</p>
<p>stealing from them and not following any of</p>
<p>their rules</p>
<p>set in place so he</p>
<p>might as well be blamed for this too</p>
<p>like he was just being such a diva</p>
<p>grant originally said that he had packed</p>
<p>his bag and then left the home around 9 30 pm</p>
<p>and that his family was fine</p>
<p>and then his</p>
<p>story changed and he said he left around 12 30</p>
<p>in the morning and</p>
<p>spent the night in a grocery</p>
<p>store parking lot then</p>
<p>drove to a job interview in the morning</p>
<p>investigators</p>
<p>were pushing trying to get some kind of confession from</p>
<p>grant but he</p>
<p>stood by his innocence</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s older brother</p>
<p>jason the one who lives on his own</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>member that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>well besides</p>
<p>grant but grant</p>
<p>is a piece of shit</p>
<p>jason comes down</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s called down and informed</p>
<p>about what happened obviously</p>
<p>jason&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>upset but they did</p>
<p>allow a one on one meeting with</p>
<p>jason and grant</p>
<p>you see jason walk in and give</p>
<p>grant a hug and then just sit down</p>
<p>and press grant</p>
<p>for some answers asking him if</p>
<p>he had anything to do with it</p>
<p>please just tell me i need closure</p>
<p>i need to know and i</p>
<p>would be very upset if i</p>
<p>heard from an attorney</p>
<p>or the media</p>
<p>that you did it</p>
<p>instead of yourself this is what</p>
<p>jason sanja grant</p>
<p>jason just seems like kindest person ever</p>
<p>completely devastated that he just lost his</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>and the only one who</p>
<p>lived at that</p>
<p>house and was still</p>
<p>alive had no answers for him</p>
<p>jason didn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>angry or aggressive at all just asking for the</p>
<p>truth it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s so sad to watch</p>
<p>based on what i</p>
<p>watched and</p>
<p>heard and read in the</p>
<p>court documents</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it just seemed like this family really cared</p>
<p>about one another and it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>heartbreaking</p>
<p>by the end of the meeting</p>
<p>jason tells</p>
<p>grant that he thought he had something to do with it</p>
<p>and that he just didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>now grant though</p>
<p>stood by his innocence</p>
<p>but also just didn&rsquo;t even say much</p>
<p>i guess he just</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t much of a talker in general so it wasn&rsquo;t unusual</p>
<p>grant was released</p>
<p>on the 26 because</p>
<p>again they had no evidence</p>
<p>showing that he did it</p>
<p>they had no</p>
<p>fingerprints no dna nothing linking him to the</p>
<p>crime so detectives knew that they were</p>
<p>going to have to</p>
<p>build like a really</p>
<p>strong case</p>
<p>against him in</p>
<p>order to get a conviction</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only one who had a motive yeah all signs are</p>
<p>pointing to him</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s actually no physical evidence and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they were struggling so they let him out and</p>
<p>investigators question anyone</p>
<p>close to the family and they get more information</p>
<p>about grant&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>with his online girlfriend</p>
<p>honey cody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>girlfriend told investigators that cody had told her</p>
<p>that he was afraid that</p>
<p>grant would kill everyone</p>
<p>and at the same time</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>investigators are</p>
<p>building their case</p>
<p>it was determined that it was not</p>
<p>murder suicide due to many</p>
<p>things cody</p>
<p>his body was on the</p>
<p>floor next to the door</p>
<p>which led to the garage</p>
<p>but there was no</p>
<p>blood on the door behind him</p>
<p>or the door</p>
<p>frame which meant that</p>
<p>the door had been opened when</p>
<p>cody was shot so someone had to shut the door after</p>
<p>cody was shot like if you die</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t shut a door</p>
<p>also it was determined that cody&rsquo;s body had been</p>
<p>moved there was a pool of</p>
<p>blood at his feet</p>
<p>and no blood near his head</p>
<p>so it was determined that his body was like</p>
<p>moved around</p>
<p>also it was determined that cody was shot from</p>
<p>three feet away</p>
<p>which again</p>
<p>proves that it wasn&rsquo;t a murder</p>
<p>suicide so it was determined that chad was shot from</p>
<p>behind and that</p>
<p>the first shot didn&rsquo;t kill him so</p>
<p>he was trying to</p>
<p>move across the</p>
<p>floor and that&rsquo;s why there were</p>
<p>streaks in the</p>
<p>blood showing that he was trying to move</p>
<p>but then he was shot</p>
<p>again while on the</p>
<p>kitchen floor</p>
<p>he was again kind of</p>
<p>moved around</p>
<p>in a way that made it look like cody had shot him</p>
<p>and then margaret</p>
<p>was not moved but she was shot</p>
<p>from behind at her desk and</p>
<p>that just killed her</p>
<p>grant was arrested and</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>three counts of premeditated murder</p>
<p>on him they</p>
<p>found a pair</p>
<p>of leather gloves</p>
<p>credit and debit card</p>
<p>which belonged to his father</p>
<p>and brother cody</p>
<p>he also had his passport with him</p>
<p>which led investigators to believe that</p>
<p>maybe he was</p>
<p>gonna try and flee go see his</p>
<p>girlfriend sylvie</p>
<p>you know there was</p>
<p>also a hand written note</p>
<p>found in grant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possession signed from cody</p>
<p>and the note it pretty much said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry for what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>going on and i&rsquo;ll take care of it don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna go too much into detail</p>
<p>about what it said because it was</p>
<p>later determined that</p>
<p>it was written by</p>
<p>grant to kind of feed into the murder suicide</p>
<p>storyline that he was trying to create</p>
<p>which is pathetic because</p>
<p>it was like his own</p>
<p>brother i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>so his trial was in july of</p>
<p>2019 and he</p>
<p>still claimed that he was innocent</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s team suggested that</p>
<p>maybe someone</p>
<p>broke into the house</p>
<p>maybe it was a drug deal gone bad</p>
<p>because they had found a</p>
<p>small amount of marijuana in the home</p>
<p>so they were like</p>
<p>oh yeah they were dealing</p>
<p>drugs how many drugs there was lots of drugs marijuana</p>
<p>oh my god they&rsquo;re dating</p>
<p>a drug deal like they just</p>
<p>found that marijuana</p>
<p>was like that&rsquo;s it drug deal gone bad you know</p>
<p>based off forensic evidence</p>
<p>it was determined that</p>
<p>margaret was shot in the head from behind as she sat</p>
<p>at her desk</p>
<p>the last activity on margaret&rsquo;s computer was at 4 44 pm</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s believed that this you know</p>
<p>started at that time</p>
<p>cody and chad were not home yet</p>
<p>when grant shot his</p>
<p>mother then</p>
<p>chad came home</p>
<p>around 5 30 p m</p>
<p>he went to the</p>
<p>kitchen to put his</p>
<p>stuff away get dinner</p>
<p>started that&rsquo;s when grant</p>
<p>quietly approached him from behind</p>
<p>and shot his father</p>
<p>and investigators</p>
<p>knew this because on chad&rsquo;s iphone was</p>
<p>it was tracking all of his steps through one of those</p>
<p>like fitness apps</p>
<p>you know the step</p>
<p>counters so they</p>
<p>could see how many steps chad took</p>
<p>and then when it stopped then cody</p>
<p>arrived home</p>
<p>from work around 10 pm</p>
<p>and he walked through the garage that connects to the</p>
<p>house he walked in the door</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>grant just shot him</p>
<p>then it said that grant</p>
<p>spent several</p>
<p>hours at the home</p>
<p>moving bodies around and staging it</p>
<p>to look like</p>
<p>again a murder suicide</p>
<p>remember how i mentioned that there were four</p>
<p>bullet shell</p>
<p>casings on the ground</p>
<p>and it was determined</p>
<p>that the four</p>
<p>bullets that were</p>
<p>found did not or the shells</p>
<p>i should say</p>
<p>did not come from any of the handguns that were</p>
<p>found in the home</p>
<p>they came from an unknown weapon</p>
<p>and the gun</p>
<p>that it came from was</p>
<p>never found also</p>
<p>chad the father had a gun</p>
<p>holster on his</p>
<p>right hip and it was</p>
<p>later proved that this was placed on him</p>
<p>after his death</p>
<p>there was a spot of</p>
<p>blood on chad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pants under the</p>
<p>holster which</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>been able to get there if he was indeed wearing the</p>
<p>holster when</p>
<p>he was shot around midnight it was determined</p>
<p>that chad had logged into his banking app on his iphone</p>
<p>using the finger</p>
<p>reader on the night</p>
<p>that he had died also it was shown that</p>
<p>money was transferred from chad</p>
<p>his bank to</p>
<p>grant&rsquo;s bank account through the app</p>
<p>jesus i know when investigators</p>
<p>looked at chats finger they saw that it had been</p>
<p>wiped clean</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s believed that grant</p>
<p>cleaned his</p>
<p>dead dad&rsquo;s finger</p>
<p>clean the finger</p>
<p>and then use it to log into his his</p>
<p>phone what kind of</p>
<p>special fucked</p>
<p>up is that that&rsquo;s when i read that was like what</p>
<p>though that same</p>
<p>night after murdering his</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>grant also used</p>
<p>cody his brother his brother&rsquo;s credit card</p>
<p>to pay and watch sylvie</p>
<p>sending her over 600</p>
<p>while sitting in his car</p>
<p>in the grocery</p>
<p>store parking lot</p>
<p>at three in the morning so</p>
<p>after he murders his family he</p>
<p>drives to a grocery</p>
<p>store parking lot</p>
<p>sits there and</p>
<p>watches sylvie</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>yeah yeah i don&rsquo;t even know what to say</p>
<p>just unbelievable so they had found</p>
<p>gloves in grant&rsquo;s possession at the time of his arrest</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>taken in to be tested for gunpowder residue which it</p>
<p>came back positive</p>
<p>grant said that&rsquo;s because he wore</p>
<p>these gloves all the time when he shot but</p>
<p>numerous witnesses said that he rarely wore</p>
<p>these gloves like ever on grant&rsquo;s computer</p>
<p>a typed out letter was</p>
<p>found by grant to send to sylvie into</p>
<p>some of his friends he made online</p>
<p>and this letter was typed</p>
<p>two days before the murders</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s long so i&rsquo;ll give you like a little summary</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>grant apologizes for</p>
<p>lying about himself and confesses that he</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t successful</p>
<p>and that he lives at home</p>
<p>that he lied because he wanted to stand out</p>
<p>sylvie and like get her attention</p>
<p>grant said that his family</p>
<p>found out about the money</p>
<p>spent and ambushed him</p>
<p>then forcefully made him</p>
<p>go to a clinic</p>
<p>for his unhealthy addiction to</p>
<p>sylvie and cam girls he then goes on to say that</p>
<p>everything his family mentioned to sylvie was a lie</p>
<p>in his image he then says that he will</p>
<p>never be able to forgive himself for making</p>
<p>sylvie sad and for betraying her</p>
<p>trust in him</p>
<p>he begs for her forgiveness and</p>
<p>asks for quote</p>
<p>an actual second chance end</p>
<p>quote then going on to say that he will</p>
<p>do whatever it takes to be able to show the real him</p>
<p>this letter is</p>
<p>eight pages</p>
<p>long just begging for forgiveness and how he will</p>
<p>never get over</p>
<p>sylvie and how he</p>
<p>never plans to replace her</p>
<p>and towards the end of the</p>
<p>eight page letter he says i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give up on her and i</p>
<p>never will she is my</p>
<p>everything i will give her my life</p>
<p>simply be able to make her</p>
<p>smile again</p>
<p>dramatic much</p>
<p>the jury spent i believe like</p>
<p>eight hours</p>
<p>and they come back</p>
<p>and give grant his verdict</p>
<p>mind you he showed</p>
<p>no no emotion</p>
<p>during the trial</p>
<p>even when his</p>
<p>older brother took the</p>
<p>stand and just cried over his lost family</p>
<p>grant just looked like</p>
<p>a vampire like he</p>
<p>kinda looks like this creepy ass</p>
<p>vampire and he was just</p>
<p>cold balding emotionless</p>
<p>fragile looking</p>
<p>vampire i don&rsquo;t know it was just like so</p>
<p>uncomfortable to</p>
<p>watch in the very beginning and like the opening</p>
<p>statements i believe</p>
<p>grant started crying when they showed</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>parents and his brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bodies to the jury</p>
<p>and throughout the whole</p>
<p>thing though just nothing it was</p>
<p>weird but then i</p>
<p>guess at one</p>
<p>point they show the jury like a</p>
<p>picture of sylvia on this screen and</p>
<p>grant like his eyes are just kind of like fixated on</p>
<p>sylvie on the big</p>
<p>screen and it&rsquo;s just like oh my god dude really</p>
<p>like your whole family&rsquo;s dead and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still obsessed with her i don&rsquo;t yep anyways</p>
<p>their jury decided not to give him the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>instead they sentenced</p>
<p>him to life in prison without the possibility of parole</p>
<p>grant a motto</p>
<p>will be spending the rest of his life in prison</p>
<p>to this day he</p>
<p>still claims that he is innocent</p>
<p>and when approached by</p>
<p>media asking for an interview he said he</p>
<p>would be open to doing so only if the company</p>
<p>would maybe help</p>
<p>cover costs to get him out of prison</p>
<p>or if they could put him in</p>
<p>touch with a millionaire who</p>
<p>would help him get out of prison</p>
<p>yeah he thinks that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>denying denying even though all signs</p>
<p>point to you</p>
<p>grant grant says he has</p>
<p>quite a few pen pals in prison and people</p>
<p>support and</p>
<p>stand by him and are</p>
<p>rooting for him to get out and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably wondering well what the heck happened sylvie</p>
<p>cause yeah i had questions too</p>
<p>some people were</p>
<p>thinking you know</p>
<p>maybe sylvie was</p>
<p>involved somehow</p>
<p>or maybe she was pressuring</p>
<p>grant to do it or</p>
<p>maybe steal the</p>
<p>money you know</p>
<p>maybe something more was</p>
<p>going on well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really know what happened to her to be honest</p>
<p>i tried to find out</p>
<p>okay i went through the</p>
<p>court documents mind you there&rsquo;s like thousands of</p>
<p>court documents so i mean</p>
<p>maybe i missed it</p>
<p>but i couldn&rsquo;t find anything</p>
<p>there were two names on the witness list that were</p>
<p>blacked out i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking that</p>
<p>maybe that was one of it was like</p>
<p>maybe sylvie</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that</p>
<p>sylvie was questioned because why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t she be i feel like that</p>
<p>would make sense</p>
<p>but in the opening</p>
<p>statements it was suggested like sylvie</p>
<p>may not be her real name</p>
<p>so i was thinking that</p>
<p>maybe sylvie was like her cam girl name</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t want her real name out there</p>
<p>in the public like when it was</p>
<p>in court and in the</p>
<p>media and whatnot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m sure they questioned her</p>
<p>right they had to i personally have a feeling that</p>
<p>sylvie i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think she had any idea</p>
<p>of what grant was really doing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that she was just</p>
<p>you know accepting</p>
<p>the money from him i mean who</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t question</p>
<p>every customer that comes into your</p>
<p>store you just</p>
<p>take the money and they get the fuck out</p>
<p>so i feel like</p>
<p>she probably didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but who knows i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so that is the horrible</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>grant a motto</p>
<p>and what he did</p>
<p>to his poor family</p>
<p>rest in peace to chad</p>
<p>margaret and cody a</p>
<p>motto whose lives were</p>
<p>taken because of this</p>
<p>selfish entitled brat who</p>
<p>sadly was their own son sheesh</p>
<p>stories like this are just</p>
<p>heartbreaking because it seems like this family</p>
<p>truly was trying to do</p>
<p>everything they</p>
<p>could for their son</p>
<p>or just their family in general a grant</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck was</p>
<p>going on with him</p>
<p>because he was acting like an entitled</p>
<p>teenager a 30 year old teenager</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just unbelievable</p>
<p>and like for what for some titties like come on</p>
<p>what was this plan</p>
<p>jeez so many questions what a</p>
<p>gross human being</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today let me know your thoughts down</p>
<p>below i think</p>
<p>naturally a lot of people want to say like mole</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t the family</p>
<p>do this and</p>
<p>do that it&rsquo;s like well you know we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know and the</p>
<p>whole thing is just sad poor family</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want kids because what if i</p>
<p>have one of</p>
<p>these shitheads oh</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what i</p>
<p>would be pissed</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day</p>
