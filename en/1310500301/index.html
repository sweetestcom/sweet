    <p>We have two tubes that are right next to each other</p>
<p>in the throat.</p>
<p>One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re gonna swallow.</p>
<p>All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,</p>
<p>the food tube, and end up in the stomach.</p>
<p>And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away,</p>
<p>is the windpipe or the trachea,</p>
<p>which goes down to the lungs.</p>
<p>Throat, heart, feces, genitals.</p>
<p>Every organ from moment to moment keeps us alive</p>
<p>and ensures our survival.</p>
<p>The genitals are, in a way, the opposite.</p>
<p>How would you improve the penis and the vagina?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman,</p>
<p>a physician and writer of The Unseen Body,</p>
<p>a doctor&rsquo;s journey through the hidden wonders</p>
<p>of human anatomy.</p>
<p>He has practiced medicine in some of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most remote places, including the Alaskan</p>
<p>and Russian Arctic, Antarctica,</p>
<p>and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jonathan Reisman.</p>
<p>You wrote a book called Unseen Body,</p>
<p>all about the human body, the messy, the weird,</p>
<p>the beautiful, and the fascinating details.</p>
<p>So, from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>are most parts of the human body a feature or a bug?</p>
<p>Is it like the optimal solution</p>
<p>or just a duct tape solution?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>I think that most of the time,</p>
<p>the way the body works is the best solution.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen many alternatives, so it&rsquo;s hard to compare.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, there&rsquo;s some parts of the body</p>
<p>that make more sense than others.</p>
<p>You know, the way our hands work, for instance.</p>
<p>You know, the muscles are up in the forearm</p>
<p>and then the tendons kind of come down</p>
<p>like strings on a puppet.</p>
<p>And just the dexterity it gives our hands</p>
<p>is just really amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a better tool</p>
<p>than the human hand to do everything from, you know,</p>
<p>hold things to play piano</p>
<p>and do a million other daily activities that we do.</p>
<p>One thing I talk about in the book,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other body parts that seem to be lacking</p>
<p>that kind of brilliant design, such as the throat,</p>
<p>you know, where the food, drink are swallowed</p>
<p>and air is inhaled, and they kind of,</p>
<p>those two paths come within millimeters of each other.</p>
<p>And you slip up once, you laugh while eating,</p>
<p>or you speak while trying to swallow and you die</p>
<p>from choking.</p>
<p>So it seems less than optimal,</p>
<p>though I&rsquo;m not sure it could be better</p>
<p>from the way we&rsquo;re kind of formed in the womb</p>
<p>as a beginning as this tiny little tube.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it could have been done any better</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s any other way to do it,</p>
<p>but it is an unfortunate thing that, you know,</p>
<p>does lead to some problems.</p>
<p>So the hand, if I could just link on that for a second,</p>
<p>you talk about the wisdom of a design in the book.</p>
<p>What are the important things about the hand?</p>
<p>It seems like very useful for many things</p>
<p>and it seems to be quite effective.</p>
<p>A lot of people think the thumb is foundational</p>
<p>to the human civilization.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to that?</p>
<p>I think that is true.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the ways in which the importance</p>
<p>of individual fingers comes to attention</p>
<p>is when people have severe injuries to their fingers.</p>
<p>For instance, I have a story in the book</p>
<p>about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off</p>
<p>by his dog&rsquo;s leash.</p>
<p>And, you know, when plastic surgeons</p>
<p>who are often the ones to repair that,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s orthopedic surgeons,</p>
<p>they will debate, you know,</p>
<p>how important is it to save this finger</p>
<p>or how important is it to save, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the kind of tip,</p>
<p>the one third, the tip one third of one of your fingers.</p>
<p>You know, it depends on the length that you&rsquo;ll lose.</p>
<p>It depends on which finger.</p>
<p>And so the thumb really is the most crucial,</p>
<p>just, you know, for your occupation in most cases</p>
<p>to just daily life and your ability to get around</p>
<p>and take care of yourself and others.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;ll be more,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re willing to go further, do more surgeries,</p>
<p>more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>than, you know, the tip of your pinky finger.</p>
<p>So in that way, I do think the thumb, you know,</p>
<p>does seem like the most important in many ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that there&rsquo;s backups.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s part of the future</p>
<p>or is it just the symmetry that nature produces?</p>
<p>You think the two hands is like,</p>
<p>is it about the symmetry or is it about backup?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be much less formidable hunters, gatherers,</p>
<p>survivors in any way if we only had one hand.</p>
<p>So I think that is important to have two</p>
<p>so we can, you know, even everything from kind of</p>
<p>spearing an animal to firing a bow and arrow</p>
<p>to butchering an animal.</p>
<p>You really need two hands to do it very effectively.</p>
<p>But can you do a better job with three?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll never know, perhaps.</p>
<p>You tweeted, now I&rsquo;m gonna analyze your tweets</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s Shakespeare sometimes.</p>
<p>You tweeted that, quote, millions of years</p>
<p>of sex and death design the human body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like poetry.</p>
<p>Are those two basic activities basically summarize</p>
<p>everything that resulted in humans on Earth?</p>
<p>So like, is that a good summary of the evolutionary process</p>
<p>that led to this conscious intelligent being,</p>
<p>is death and sex?</p>
<p>In a way, yeah.</p>
<p>So sex is how more of us get made, obviously.</p>
<p>And death is how we get weeded out</p>
<p>or the gene pool gets weeded out</p>
<p>and certain genes survive and others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And, you know, the age at which we die,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s before we&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>had sex and reproduced ourselves is a big factor</p>
<p>and who survives, who doesn&rsquo;t, who passes on their genes</p>
<p>and what the future of the body looks like.</p>
<p>You know, who lived and who died</p>
<p>before they were able to be at reproductive age</p>
<p>a million years ago was pretty important</p>
<p>in what we look like now.</p>
<p>And perhaps how we have sex and die now</p>
<p>will determine what we&rsquo;re shaped like</p>
<p>unless technology has an even bigger role in that,</p>
<p>you know, a million years from now.</p>
<p>So you think that&rsquo;s fundamental</p>
<p>to like if there&rsquo;s alien civilizations out there</p>
<p>that have the same order of magnitude</p>
<p>of intelligence or greater,</p>
<p>do you think that we will see something like sex</p>
<p>and something like death?</p>
<p>So the reproducing and this selection process</p>
<p>plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new,</p>
<p>is that kind of foundational to life?</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>I mean, it sure seems to be on earth,</p>
<p>you know, perhaps in some distant future</p>
<p>when medicine is nearing, you know, perfection</p>
<p>and people can live a really long time.</p>
<p>Maybe we won&rsquo;t even need to reproduce as much</p>
<p>or something like that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to even know what life will be like</p>
<p>in the distant future.</p>
<p>But I would guess that any alien civilization</p>
<p>will have the same dependence on who has sex and who dies.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem with immortality.</p>
<p>How are we going to clear out the old</p>
<p>to make room for the new, which is kind of a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a framework of adaptability</p>
<p>to changing environments.</p>
<p>So as long as the environment is changing,</p>
<p>and it seems to always be,</p>
<p>because the entirety of the earth system</p>
<p>is a complex system, it seems like you have to adapt.</p>
<p>And to adapt, you have to kill off the stubborn old ideas.</p>
<p>And unless there&rsquo;s a way to like not become stubborn and old,</p>
<p>but it feels like the nature of wisdom is stubborn and old.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what wisdom is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the lessons of life,</p>
<p>the lessons of experience solidified.</p>
<p>And the solidification is the thing</p>
<p>that actually prevents you from reinventing yourself</p>
<p>to adapt to the new changing conditions.</p>
<p>But then again, why not have that both of those modes?</p>
<p>Like have two minds and one person,</p>
<p>one immortal person that like in the morning,</p>
<p>they act like a teenager,</p>
<p>in the evening they act like a old wise man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So you see, you can imagine within one mind both modes,</p>
<p>but those are required.</p>
<p>You have to have the ability</p>
<p>to completely reinvent yourself,</p>
<p>which is what death does in an ugly way,</p>
<p>or a beautiful way, depending on your perspective,</p>
<p>depending whether you take the human perspective</p>
<p>or the human, the nature&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>And then you have to have the selection.</p>
<p>So competition, so sexual selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, interesting little planet we got.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the weirdest part, function, concept, idea</p>
<p>about the human body to you?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about fascinating details,</p>
<p>but I should say for people that should read your book,</p>
<p>they will come face to face with the fact</p>
<p>that you do not shy away from the weird</p>
<p>and the wonderful of the human body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s fun, but it&rsquo;s honest.</p>
<p>So given that, sorry to make you pick one of your children,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the weirdest one, would you say?</p>
<p>The weirdest body part.</p>
<p>Or concept or function.</p>
<p>So the chapters, you divide it up kind of into parts,</p>
<p>but there could be a thread that connects all of them,</p>
<p>the weirdness, maybe, or maybe the texture of the substance.</p>
<p>It could be the liquids, the solids, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Definitely every body part and bodily fluid</p>
<p>has their own kind of both gross and fascinating aspects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;m a generalist as a doctor</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t just, as you said, pick one of my children,</p>
<p>become a specialist, because I like them all.</p>
<p>I feel like one of the strangest concepts</p>
<p>about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it</p>
<p>that are the most universal, that we all do,</p>
<p>are the most taboo socially.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected that if I had, you know,</p>
<p>just looked from the outside, like what we do</p>
<p>in the bathroom, what we do in the bedroom,</p>
<p>what we do to our own genitals, what we do to our,</p>
<p>you know, quote unquote, private parts, they&rsquo;re private,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s sort of the thing that we all have</p>
<p>in common is the most we try to hide from other people</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t talk about in polite company.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes sense as a human living in this society,</p>
<p>but from the outside, it sort of might be surprising.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of that if you put on</p>
<p>your Sigmund Freud hat?</p>
<p>The thing we all do, why do we make that a taboo thing?</p>
<p>Is it because we like taboos?</p>
<p>Maybe we get off, or maybe our kinks as humans</p>
<p>is to have taboos, and it&rsquo;s kind of efficient</p>
<p>to have taboos about the things that everybody does.</p>
<p>Like, you can make walking taboo or something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But just, maybe that&rsquo;s what we love,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s exciting to us, is the forbidden.</p>
<p>I think, yes, society loves rules, for sure.</p>
<p>They love, some societies more than others.</p>
<p>You know, they love controlling how you think</p>
<p>and what you do in public versus in private.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of societies where, for instance,</p>
<p>parents have sex in front of children.</p>
<p>Not, you know, for instance, like in traditional</p>
<p>Inupiat Eskimo societies, that was sort of normal.</p>
<p>I mean, but what are you gonna do,</p>
<p>go outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic</p>
<p>and do it out there?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s different taboos</p>
<p>in different societies.</p>
<p>Some taboos make perfect sense.</p>
<p>Some taboos are even public health measures,</p>
<p>you know, like, as I talk in the book about in India,</p>
<p>where they, you know, the hands are symmetric, as you said,</p>
<p>but in Indian culture, and the left hand is taboo,</p>
<p>and the right hand is what you use for shaking hands,</p>
<p>for eating, for other things, and the left hand</p>
<p>is the dirty hand that you use for wiping your own bottom.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the toilet paper is your left hand.</p>
<p>So, while the body is anatomically symmetric,</p>
<p>the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry.</p>
<p>But for a good reason, you know,</p>
<p>yet you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be shaking hands</p>
<p>with other people with the same hand that you use</p>
<p>to kind of clean your bottom.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe the roots of it makes sense,</p>
<p>but the way it propagates, especially as the times change,</p>
<p>might not, because you can wash your hands.</p>
<p>But the taboo remains.</p>
<p>Right, society is very slow to change.</p>
<p>What is the most fascinating part, function,</p>
<p>or concept in the human body?</p>
<p>So, you know, something that fills you with awe.</p>
<p>I guess the most obvious one is the brain,</p>
<p>partly because it&rsquo;s so, you know, sort of poorly understood,</p>
<p>though we understand more than we ever have in the past.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still so much that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about how the lump of matter in our skulls</p>
<p>kind of creates this subjective experience</p>
<p>that we all kind of understand quite viscerally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy one.</p>
<p>I would say the kidneys are an underappreciated organ.</p>
<p>The way they tinker with the bloodstream,</p>
<p>raise levels of this, lower levels of that,</p>
<p>kind of our entire lives from inside the womb until we die</p>
<p>is just really incredible.</p>
<p>And when you look at how much energy</p>
<p>different organs consume,</p>
<p>the brain and the kidneys are two of the biggest ones,</p>
<p>because the brain obviously in us is always active,</p>
<p>and controlling parts of the body,</p>
<p>but the kidneys are just consuming a ton of energy</p>
<p>to do what they do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of the unsung hero of the body,</p>
<p>relegated to the back of the abdomen,</p>
<p>like some forgotten organ, but they are great.</p>
<p>I did consider being a nephrologist,</p>
<p>which is a kidney specialist,</p>
<p>because I was so taken with the kidneys,</p>
<p>but decided I like all the organs,</p>
<p>so couldn&rsquo;t pick just one.</p>
<p>So your book is ordered in a particular way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s throat, heart, feces, genitals, liver, pineal gland,</p>
<p>brain, skin, urine, fat, lungs, eyes, mucus,</p>
<p>fingers and toes, and blood.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>First of all, great chapter titles.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for this ordering, or is it all madness?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few different reasons that went into it.</p>
<p>I did wanna start with the throat for the reason</p>
<p>that it kind of presents the topic of death,</p>
<p>which is sort of obviously very important</p>
<p>in the training of a physician, in the career of physician.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big part of what I deal with.</p>
<p>On the first day of medical school,</p>
<p>we started the dissection of a cadaver</p>
<p>in the class called anatomy lab.</p>
<p>And so in a way, we were kind of thrown right in there</p>
<p>in the beginning, like this is the end of the human story.</p>
<p>Understand this, and then we sort of backed up</p>
<p>to the beginning with embryology and reproduction and stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like we got, and I got thrown into that</p>
<p>right away, right in the beginning,</p>
<p>kind of like here&rsquo;s a dead body.</p>
<p>Now start cutting it apart and learn the name</p>
<p>and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.</p>
<p>How did that change you, that first experience</p>
<p>with the cold honesty of human biology?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s exactly what it was,</p>
<p>is cold honesty about kind of the story</p>
<p>of each individual human body.</p>
<p>It has an end, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think that, well, actually before the end</p>
<p>of that first day, so what we did on that first day</p>
<p>was study the superficial muscles of the back,</p>
<p>like the lats or latissimus dorsi and some other muscles.</p>
<p>We cut through the skin of the back.</p>
<p>My cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney.</p>
<p>We pulled back the kind of plastic sheets</p>
<p>that would keep him moist for the next four months</p>
<p>as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back,</p>
<p>and then started dissecting through the superficial muscles</p>
<p>of the back.</p>
<p>And that was really all we saw that first day.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get any deeper, didn&rsquo;t enter the abdominal</p>
<p>or chest cavity to see internal organs,</p>
<p>but I was so fascinated with this sort of</p>
<p>behind the scenes look at how things work in the body,</p>
<p>how you move your arms, how you arch your back.</p>
<p>You know, these are the muscles that do it</p>
<p>that I decided I wanted to donate my own body</p>
<p>for the same purpose.</p>
<p>So I made that decision literally</p>
<p>before the end of that first day of class,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still sticking to it.</p>
<p>So someday there&rsquo;ll be a medical student</p>
<p>that can watch and listen to this podcast</p>
<p>while dissecting your body.</p>
<p>It could happen.</p>
<p>They might not know that that person</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re listening to on the podcast</p>
<p>will be the carcass in front of them,</p>
<p>but we never learned anything.</p>
<p>The universe will know.</p>
<p>And they will acknowledge the irony or the humor,</p>
<p>the absurdity of that.</p>
<p>The universe will chuckle,</p>
<p>but the medical student won&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because they never, as I did not,</p>
<p>learn any personal information about the person,</p>
<p>only what I could glean from looking inside them,</p>
<p>which actually tells you quite a bit.</p>
<p>I knew he was a smoker.</p>
<p>I knew he had coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>You know, you get a window into,</p>
<p>I knew he was overweight.</p>
<p>You get a window into people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>just by looking in their bodies after death.</p>
<p>Other cadavers in the lab, not my own,</p>
<p>or I shared one with three other students,</p>
<p>but other cadavers, some had metal joints,</p>
<p>like a knee replacement.</p>
<p>Some had a kidney missing.</p>
<p>So they probably,</p>
<p>and we could tell it was surgically removed,</p>
<p>not that he was born with one.</p>
<p>And we could tell that he probably had a kidney tumor</p>
<p>or cancer that was removed.</p>
<p>So you do get an insight into people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>from picking them apart after they&rsquo;re dead,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know their name</p>
<p>or what podcast they&rsquo;ve been on.</p>
<p>So as the book title says, Unseen Body,</p>
<p>so it tells some kind of story of your life.</p>
<p>So it does capture the decisions you&rsquo;ve made in your life,</p>
<p>the things you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>that might be kind of secret to that person</p>
<p>and maybe to a few others that knew him or her well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>So what kind of things can it reveal?</p>
<p>Like what kind of choices in terms of the injuries,</p>
<p>the catastrophic events,</p>
<p>the lifestyle choices of smoking and diet</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>What can you see?</p>
<p>What kind of history can you see about the human before you?</p>
<p>So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.</p>
<p>Take the skin, for example, right?</p>
<p>Most things that happen to us leave a mark,</p>
<p>as I say, kind of a story written in the language of scar</p>
<p>where it tells you injuries you&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>And same thing with animals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen deer hides that have marks</p>
<p>that look like they&rsquo;re made by maybe a barbed wire fence,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>You can tell, sometimes it&rsquo;s conjecture,</p>
<p>but you can sort of imagine what might&rsquo;ve happened</p>
<p>to cause that.</p>
<p>Perhaps two bucks were fighting</p>
<p>and one got injured with an antler.</p>
<p>And the same with humans.</p>
<p>I have scars on my body,</p>
<p>and when I notice them, I remember what happened.</p>
<p>I got a big cut on my hand when I was 13,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still there,</p>
<p>and I remember what happened every time I look at it.</p>
<p>And so in that way, only I might know that story,</p>
<p>but other people, when they dissect me</p>
<p>and notice the same scars,</p>
<p>they can kind of, it can fire their imagination</p>
<p>as my cadaver, you know, did for me.</p>
<p>They know that there is a story there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting way</p>
<p>that the skin does tell a story,</p>
<p>both tattoos and scars.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Some of the fun you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>and some of the damage you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And even when I evaluate a patient,</p>
<p>I can use scars to help me make medical decisions.</p>
<p>So for instance, someone that comes in with abdominal pain</p>
<p>into the emergency room,</p>
<p>you can see scars on their abdomen</p>
<p>that tell you about, you know,</p>
<p>the past kind of activities of a surgeon, perhaps.</p>
<p>I know, I recognize the scars that are left</p>
<p>when someone has their gallbladder removed,</p>
<p>the scars when someone has their appendix removed,</p>
<p>maybe when someone&rsquo;s had a hysterectomy,</p>
<p>and that can tell you what it might be or what it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know, if someone doesn&rsquo;t have an appendix,</p>
<p>their abdominal pain&rsquo;s not appendicitis, end of story.</p>
<p>So in that way, I&rsquo;m sort of looking at these,</p>
<p>the tracks or the footprints of past surgeries</p>
<p>to tell me what might and might not be the cause</p>
<p>of this patient&rsquo;s abdominal pain,</p>
<p>which is kind of my main job in the ER</p>
<p>is figuring out what&rsquo;s causing it and to help them.</p>
<p>Is there ways to get more data about the human body</p>
<p>as we look into the future of medicine biology</p>
<p>that will be helpful to fill in some of the gaps</p>
<p>of the story?</p>
<p>So, you know, you have companies,</p>
<p>you have research that looks at, you know,</p>
<p>collection of blood over long periods of time</p>
<p>to see sort of, you know, paint the picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in your body,</p>
<p>mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,</p>
<p>but also just, you know, to anticipate things</p>
<p>that can go wrong and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Is there, can you just speak to a greater digital world</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re stepping in,</p>
<p>how that can help tell a richer story?</p>
<p>I certainly think that we have more data</p>
<p>than we know what to do with right now,</p>
<p>especially with kind of direct to consumer medical devices,</p>
<p>you know, smartwatches, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are just collecting these reams of data.</p>
<p>I have not seen them put to,</p>
<p>I think the eventual use that they will.</p>
<p>I think that the potential is sort of just, you know,</p>
<p>unimaginable and I hope we&rsquo;re heading into a new age</p>
<p>where, you know, you can determine, for instance,</p>
<p>is a person gonna have more of the dangerous side effects</p>
<p>to a drug based on their genetics</p>
<p>or are they gonna tolerate one drug better than the other,</p>
<p>you know, based on their genetics?</p>
<p>And we are slowly moving into that age</p>
<p>and especially the age of kind of</p>
<p>completely synthesizing drugs in the lab,</p>
<p>you know, much like, for instance,</p>
<p>some of the COVID vaccines actually,</p>
<p>like Moderna never had the virus in their lab.</p>
<p>They made that vaccine completely</p>
<p>without ever having the virus themselves</p>
<p>just by having the genome, which is sort of astounding.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of potential going forward, you know,</p>
<p>based on that technology and some others.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So they basically, it&rsquo;s all in the computer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s computational.</p>
<p>Right, you have the genetic code,</p>
<p>you have tremendous power,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have the organism itself.</p>
<p>What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes and efforts like that?</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m a curious,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawn to the darkness in human nature</p>
<p>because that somehow reveals</p>
<p>the full spectrum of what humans could be.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of controversial thoughts</p>
<p>about who she is and her efforts and so on.</p>
<p>I think you may have even tweeted about it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve read a lot of your tweets, so I&rsquo;m now forgetting.</p>
<p>But what do you make of her and both those efforts</p>
<p>and the charlatans that sort of snake oil salesmen</p>
<p>that promise those efforts to do more</p>
<p>than they currently can?</p>
<p>I think that her, you know, that goal that she had</p>
<p>that she created Theranos to try to achieve,</p>
<p>to use less blood in tests is a very worthy goal</p>
<p>and a huge frontier that we have not achieved</p>
<p>and that I hope we will achieve.</p>
<p>So I understand why, you know,</p>
<p>someone describes what a huge step forward that would be</p>
<p>and it would be indeed.</p>
<p>I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.</p>
<p>Can you describe what was the promise?</p>
<p>What are we even talking about with Theranos,</p>
<p>just for people who don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>So Theranos is a company that was basically started</p>
<p>to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,</p>
<p>both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it.</p>
<p>You know, if anyone&rsquo;s ever been to the doctor</p>
<p>and had five to 10 tubes of blood removed from them,</p>
<p>it can be quite surprising how much they take out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s the limitation of our technology</p>
<p>that we need those volumes of blood</p>
<p>to run all the tests that we want to.</p>
<p>And so the promise of Theranos was that perhaps</p>
<p>with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know</p>
<p>as much about the person&rsquo;s, the condition of their body</p>
<p>without drawing all that blood and thereby, you know,</p>
<p>there would be these devices she was gonna create</p>
<p>that would sort of do it.</p>
<p>You put a drop of blood in and it spits out everything</p>
<p>you ever wanted to know about what&rsquo;s in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>And in a way that would make it so much easier,</p>
<p>you know, it could be, you could have one in your home</p>
<p>theoretically, and you, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d wonder</p>
<p>what your potassium level is on any given day,</p>
<p>but you could check if you wanted to.</p>
<p>And so that goal is very worthy.</p>
<p>You know, I put that goal up there with the frontier</p>
<p>of making painkillers that are as good as opioids</p>
<p>without the addictive quality.</p>
<p>You know, that would be such a huge revolution</p>
<p>if we did have that in medicine.</p>
<p>But, and particularly for me,</p>
<p>cause I trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine.</p>
<p>So I learned to care for both children and adults.</p>
<p>In children, we do draw much less blood.</p>
<p>They have a much lower blood volume.</p>
<p>And we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood.</p>
<p>And we seemingly get equivalent information</p>
<p>out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still unclear to be honest,</p>
<p>why we can&rsquo;t draw that little amount of blood from adults.</p>
<p>It seems technically possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the barriers are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are, or else we&rsquo;d be doing it.</p>
<p>But I do think that that is a very important goal.</p>
<p>And if Theranos had done it,</p>
<p>it would have really revolutionized the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>So to return to that cadaver,</p>
<p>that first day when you got to meet with the dead,</p>
<p>with a human body that&rsquo;s no longer living.</p>
<p>So how quickly did it take for you to get used to sort of,</p>
<p>you said, looking at the surface muscles of the back?</p>
<p>I mean, that can be overwhelming as a thought.</p>
<p>And people listening to this that have never dissected</p>
<p>anything might be overwhelmed by that thought.</p>
<p>So like, how quickly were you able to get used</p>
<p>to the brutal honesty of the biology before you?</p>
<p>For me, it did not take long at all.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve never been a squeamish person.</p>
<p>So for me, it was kind of riveting and fascinating</p>
<p>right from the first moment.</p>
<p>But I do know some of my fellow classmates</p>
<p>did have some trouble with it.</p>
<p>Some of them I heard had nightmares in the first few weeks</p>
<p>of anatomy lab.</p>
<p>But then everyone, as far as I know, got used to it.</p>
<p>And that was also actually a big lesson for me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pretty amazing what people can get used to</p>
<p>in their daily lives.</p>
<p>And I kind of extrapolated that to people living through war</p>
<p>and through just terrible situations</p>
<p>and living under oppressive regimes.</p>
<p>And it really is amazing what people can get used to,</p>
<p>almost anything.</p>
<p>Well, you know, in war, people often come back</p>
<p>and they have nightmares.</p>
<p>They suffer through it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s PTSD.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of complicated feelings with that.</p>
<p>Are echoes of those same complicated feelings possible</p>
<p>in the case of training to be and becoming a doctor?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think sometimes, just as a barbed wire fence</p>
<p>can leave a scar on your skin,</p>
<p>emotional, psychological experiences</p>
<p>can leave a mark on your brain or your memory.</p>
<p>And I think that that definitely could be a problem</p>
<p>in medical training.</p>
<p>You do see a lot of things that are very shocking,</p>
<p>very repulsive, things that you&rsquo;d never forget.</p>
<p>I know one of those students that had nightmares initially</p>
<p>went on to be a surgeon.</p>
<p>So I imagine she&rsquo;s not having the PTSD</p>
<p>of kind of seeing inside her first dead body</p>
<p>because she sees inside them all day, every day now.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure it could.</p>
<p>You know, we go on to see so many kind of grosser</p>
<p>or more shocking things in medical training</p>
<p>through medical school and then by working</p>
<p>with actual living patients,</p>
<p>not just dead and embalmed bodies.</p>
<p>So I do think that things can leave a mark,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that initial cadaver</p>
<p>would be the most traumatic.</p>
<p>Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,</p>
<p>the demons make you a better surgeon,</p>
<p>just like some of your own psychological trauma</p>
<p>might make you a better psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Returning to the ordering, is it order or is it chaos</p>
<p>to the ordering of the chapters from throat and heart</p>
<p>and feces and genitals all the way</p>
<p>to fingers and toes and blood?</p>
<p>So I did mention that, you know,</p>
<p>throat was the first one because I kind of wanted</p>
<p>to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death.</p>
<p>And I followed it up with feces as the third chapter</p>
<p>and in a way, partly to also throw them right</p>
<p>into the deep end of how I like discussing parts</p>
<p>of the body and revealing their gross</p>
<p>and fascinating aspects.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t want to hide anything.</p>
<p>You know, when you train to be a doctor,</p>
<p>everything is on the table, literally in the cadaver lab,</p>
<p>but also just, you know, you deal with blood</p>
<p>and piss and vomit and feces.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the medium of your craft.</p>
<p>And yes, the medium of the craft, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a painter, this is the paint.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.</p>
<p>Like almost like a dance because there&rsquo;s multiple painters.</p>
<p>One of the painters is the biology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to throat.</p>
<p>You mentioned it&rsquo;s a weird one.</p>
<p>So first of all, a friend of mine said,</p>
<p>I just see humans as like a bunch of holes</p>
<p>that just walk around.</p>
<p>Not untrue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny way to look at humans.</p>
<p>So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth,</p>
<p>we have the sexual holes, vagina, penis.</p>
<p>And then, you know, what&rsquo;s the medical term</p>
<p>for your asshole?</p>
<p>Anus.</p>
<p>Anus, thank you.</p>
<p>This is a very technical discussion.</p>
<p>The rectum&rsquo;s further in, don&rsquo;t confuse the two.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between throat and mouth?</p>
<p>By the way, so when you say throat,</p>
<p>are we talking about when that hole actually becomes tubular?</p>
<p>The throat I would count as just sort of the very back</p>
<p>of the back of the mouth, where the nose also comes down</p>
<p>and meets it, where the tonsils are and the uvula.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right that we are a bunch of holes.</p>
<p>But more accurately, we&rsquo;re a tube, right?</p>
<p>We start in the womb as kind of this microscopic little disc,</p>
<p>almost like a flatbread.</p>
<p>And then we roll almost like a burrito into this tube.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re a simple microscopic tube.</p>
<p>And from there, we grow into this bigger and bigger tube</p>
<p>and we become more complicated.</p>
<p>And each end of the tube does split into various holes.</p>
<p>So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,</p>
<p>the front end of our body, right?</p>
<p>It splits into the nose, the mouth, the ears, the sinuses,</p>
<p>the tube to the lungs, which is the windpipe,</p>
<p>the tube down to the stomach, which is the esophagus.</p>
<p>And then the other end of the tube splits as well.</p>
<p>Men end up with two holes and women end up with three holes.</p>
<p>The urethra, the vagina, and the anus, and men.</p>
<p>The urethra and kind of the reproductive system,</p>
<p>they share a hole.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning a lot today.</p>
<p>It really is incredible that you start from a sperm and an egg</p>
<p>and you have some DNA information.</p>
<p>And from that, the building project begins.</p>
<p>And then what that leads to is like pizza dough</p>
<p>and then you roll it into a tube.</p>
<p>And that tube then eventually sort of becomes</p>
<p>more and more complicated and gets eyes and a brain</p>
<p>and then can create a Twitter account.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really incredible that we&rsquo;re just a fancy tube.</p>
<p>Right, we are.</p>
<p>And we sprout eyes and a brain and a sense of smell</p>
<p>and taste pretty much to regulate what comes in</p>
<p>the front of the tube.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna eat anything dangerous or poisonous.</p>
<p>We wanna choose what we eat, even choose who we kiss.</p>
<p>Well, we seem to be motivated by what comes out</p>
<p>of the tube as well in part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just output, it&rsquo;s a feedback mechanism seemingly.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re also monitoring the functioning of the output.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just obsessed about the input.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very obsessed with the output.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right about that.</p>
<p>People have medical complaints about their output</p>
<p>very often that are, I never cease to be surprised</p>
<p>by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output.</p>
<p>I think people have gone to wars over the output</p>
<p>and maybe sometimes the lack of the output</p>
<p>or the desire for output for the particular other humans</p>
<p>that you fancy, the brain and the eyes that sprouted</p>
<p>somehow convinced the rest of the body</p>
<p>that this one particular other tube is fanciful.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to go to major wars</p>
<p>and lead global suffering because of the fancy</p>
<p>and the desire for additional output with the other tube.</p>
<p>Okay, so on the throat, that part of the tube,</p>
<p>is it, you said the design is not,</p>
<p>you could have thought of maybe a little bit better options</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too multifunctional.</p>
<p>Is that, can you sort of elaborate</p>
<p>on the multifunctional nature of this part?</p>
<p>Are a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional</p>
<p>or do you find that more specialization</p>
<p>is going to get the job done better?</p>
<p>There is a lot of organs, for instance,</p>
<p>do have multiple functions.</p>
<p>The pancreas is like two organs in one.</p>
<p>One secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes</p>
<p>into the gut to help you digest and absorb food.</p>
<p>The liver is like 15 organs in one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing how many different things it does.</p>
<p>But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat</p>
<p>is as I said, we have two tubes</p>
<p>that are right next to each other in the throat.</p>
<p>One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re gonna swallow,</p>
<p>all of that stuff must go down the esophagus,</p>
<p>the food tube and end up in the stomach.</p>
<p>And right next to the esophagus millimeters away</p>
<p>is the windpipe or the trachea,</p>
<p>which goes down to the lungs.</p>
<p>And your throat does these daily gymnastics</p>
<p>to keep everything but air out of the windpipe</p>
<p>because you slip up once and you can die.</p>
<p>You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s curtains, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So it seems like every aspect of the body</p>
<p>when I was learning about it in med school</p>
<p>seemed so brilliant and so perfectly designed</p>
<p>by evolution or whoever you might think designed it</p>
<p>to favor survival, to enhance life,</p>
<p>but the throat seemed the opposite.</p>
<p>It seemed set up almost for failure.</p>
<p>And we developed all these mechanisms as a compensation.</p>
<p>We have the gag reflex whenever food or something</p>
<p>is headed towards your air pipe, your windpipe</p>
<p>or down to your lungs,</p>
<p>your throat has this sort of like rejection of it.</p>
<p>It pushes it away in a gag reflex.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have a cough,</p>
<p>which is something our body does</p>
<p>when something inappropriate does get down the windpipe.</p>
<p>When we get a little food down the wrong pipe,</p>
<p>we end up coughing and the coughing does</p>
<p>usually flush it out and get rid of it.</p>
<p>We even have something called the mucus elevator</p>
<p>in our lungs, which is this constant flow of mucus</p>
<p>up the airways, up to the trachea, dragging with it</p>
<p>all kinds of particulates that we&rsquo;ve inhaled</p>
<p>and perhaps some food that went down the wrong pipe</p>
<p>and drags it up into the throat and we swallow it</p>
<p>kind of unconsciously all day, every day is the truth.</p>
<p>Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated.</p>
<p>It uses a number of cranial nerves.</p>
<p>It uses over 15 different muscles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.</p>
<p>You can see someone&rsquo;s Adam&rsquo;s apple in their neck</p>
<p>kind of jump upward when they swallow,</p>
<p>which helps lift the airway up against the epiglottis,</p>
<p>which plugs it closed and allows food or swallow drink</p>
<p>to kind of skirt just past it.</p>
<p>But every time we swallow, those things do come</p>
<p>within millimeters of going down the wrong pipe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just thanks to these kind of compensations,</p>
<p>these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat</p>
<p>that keeps us alive.</p>
<p>As I actually took a sip of water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of, it makes you appreciate</p>
<p>the wonderful machinery of it all.</p>
<p>By the way, we have pulled up your Instagram</p>
<p>that people should follow.</p>
<p>You have a post about the throat</p>
<p>and just showing so many different components</p>
<p>from the tongue to the trachea, the esophagus,</p>
<p>just the entire machinery of it all.</p>
<p>The teeth for the chewing, it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the structure of this,</p>
<p>the anatomy and the physiology,</p>
<p>does it echo other mammals?</p>
<p>Are we just basically borrowing a lot of stuff</p>
<p>from evolution and maybe making small adjustments</p>
<p>maybe due to the fact that we&rsquo;re not using our mouth</p>
<p>to murder things as other predators might?</p>
<p>We use our thumbs.</p>
<p>Exactly, we have hands, we don&rsquo;t need to bite them.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between different animals</p>
<p>which I find very comforting and fascinating.</p>
<p>Someone asked me, is there any animal</p>
<p>in which the throat is better designed?</p>
<p>And my first thought was whales</p>
<p>because the blowhole&rsquo;s kind of up on the top of their head.</p>
<p>So I was thinking, oh, maybe they are more separate.</p>
<p>But when I looked into it, actually no,</p>
<p>the paths do come very close, just like in us.</p>
<p>And I saw a paper about some new discovered organ</p>
<p>that actually helps keep food and drink</p>
<p>out of the airway in whales</p>
<p>that they hadn&rsquo;t ever noticed before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different mechanism,</p>
<p>but the same kind of basic problem is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re tubes and the air tube and food tube</p>
<p>are right next to each other.</p>
<p>How well do we understand,</p>
<p>so just even linger on this little part,</p>
<p>is there still mysteries about the complexity</p>
<p>of the system?</p>
<p>You mentioned just even for swallowing</p>
<p>all these parts in the brain that are responsible</p>
<p>and all the different things that have to,</p>
<p>like an orchestra play together.</p>
<p>Do we have a good sense from both a medical perspective</p>
<p>and a biology perspective or is there still mysteries?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely still mysteries.</p>
<p>We understand a lot about, for instance,</p>
<p>how the swallowing mechanism is coordinated</p>
<p>in the brainstem,</p>
<p>sometimes using some higher levels of the brain,</p>
<p>but it is a very thoughtless thing</p>
<p>as you mentioned when you drank the water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something we have to think about, thankfully,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;d be thinking about it all day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about the basic mechanisms,</p>
<p>perhaps about how the nerves fire</p>
<p>and how they kind of coordinate on the microscopic level,</p>
<p>how ions rush into and out of nerve cells</p>
<p>to kind of create that electrical signal,</p>
<p>but we sure understand a heck of a lot</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very fascinating.</p>
<p>So, moving on to chapter two and we&rsquo;ll jump around.</p>
<p>And you actually said the liver does a lot of things.</p>
<p>I also saw you retweet something</p>
<p>where it said, you know,</p>
<p>showing that the liver is bigger than the heart,</p>
<p>which is the body or the universe&rsquo;s way of saying</p>
<p>you should drink more and care less,</p>
<p>which is a good line.</p>
<p>So, you give props, like you said, to the kidney,</p>
<p>to the liver, to the maybe, to the organs,</p>
<p>to the parts that don&rsquo;t often get as much credit</p>
<p>as they deserve, but let us go for time to the human heart.</p>
<p>We get chest pain.</p>
<p>We talk about it when we talk about love for some reason.</p>
<p>Why do we talk about the heart when we talk about love?</p>
<p>There sometimes can actually be</p>
<p>some chest pain involved in love.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a med student,</p>
<p>I was very smitten with another medical student</p>
<p>who was totally brilliant and beautiful.</p>
<p>And it actually does cause</p>
<p>this kind of burning in your chest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s from the heart itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was like acid reflux</p>
<p>because I was so nervous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure,</p>
<p>but I definitely felt something in my chest</p>
<p>whenever I saw her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is,</p>
<p>but you could see why someone might think,</p>
<p>oh, you know, maybe it is your heart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the most prominent organ in your chest.</p>
<p>When people come to the ER with chest pain,</p>
<p>the big question is, is it my heart?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my main job is figuring out if it is or not.</p>
<p>So I could see why.</p>
<p>The way ancients saw the functions of different organs</p>
<p>is fascinating, but often hard to explain.</p>
<p>Would it be fair to say</p>
<p>that if you look at the entirety of human history,</p>
<p>the way most people die has to do with the heart?</p>
<p>Well, like in America today,</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease</p>
<p>is one of the most common,</p>
<p>perhaps the most common cause of death.</p>
<p>You know, 100 years ago, 200 years ago,</p>
<p>it was probably not.</p>
<p>People were not living as long</p>
<p>and people were dying of infections</p>
<p>that we tend to die less of these days.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s true, but in terms of things to stab,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m trying to sort of introspect</p>
<p>like why talk about the heart and love?</p>
<p>My thought would be that it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>the heart was seen as the most important organism.</p>
<p>It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart.</p>
<p>The originator of life and the way you figure that out</p>
<p>from sort of an ancient perspective</p>
<p>is when you stab things,</p>
<p>what is likely to lead to issues?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s possible to imagine</p>
<p>that the brain is not as special as we might think</p>
<p>from when you don&rsquo;t understand modern biology</p>
<p>or physiology or neuroscience, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>especially because pain, you know, it&rsquo;s painless too,</p>
<p>if you stab it, the brain, I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, so that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a kind of a poetic answer to</p>
<p>maybe the way people wrote about it,</p>
<p>but what to you is the wisdom in the design of the heart?</p>
<p>I mean, the main function of the heart basically</p>
<p>is to push blood through the cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>through the branching blood vessels</p>
<p>to feed every cell in the body.</p>
<p>You know, when I believe our ancestors</p>
<p>started off as single celled organisms</p>
<p>floating in some ancient brew,</p>
<p>and they were surrounded by the medium</p>
<p>that would bring them all the nutrients they needed,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no issues there.</p>
<p>And then once you start getting multicellular organisms,</p>
<p>the kind of that are thicker and the ones on the inside</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t in contact with that sort of nutritious brew</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re growing in,</p>
<p>you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients</p>
<p>to every cell, and so that&rsquo;s what the heart</p>
<p>and the branching vascular tree do.</p>
<p>So the heart, you know, it&rsquo;s the biggest disconnect</p>
<p>between how the organs talked about in poetry</p>
<p>and through history versus its actual function</p>
<p>is probably the heart,</p>
<p>because we ascribe all these things like love and passion</p>
<p>and life itself sometimes to the heart,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s just a simple mechanical pump,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna downplay it, it&rsquo;s amazing,</p>
<p>but you know, it just pushes.</p>
<p>It fills with blood and then squeezes it,</p>
<p>fills with blood and squeezes it,</p>
<p>and just that squeezing, that pushing,</p>
<p>creates the blood pressure that you need</p>
<p>to get blood to every cell in your body,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re standing upright</p>
<p>to get blood to your brain,</p>
<p>you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing to you how much volume of blood</p>
<p>just gets pushed through by this pump?</p>
<p>Absolutely, they say every red blood cell</p>
<p>takes about five minutes to circulate</p>
<p>and come back to the heart,</p>
<p>and that circulation kind of starts in the womb</p>
<p>and continues kind of until the moment that we die,</p>
<p>but the volume is tremendous,</p>
<p>and it can never take a break, basically.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of propagating all kinds of stuff</p>
<p>throughout the body, it&rsquo;s a delivery mechanism,</p>
<p>blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff,</p>
<p>nutrition, drugs, all that.</p>
<p>Right, medications too.</p>
<p>Medications, such a fascinating design.</p>
<p>And it also takes the waste away,</p>
<p>it kind of brings the nutritious stuff,</p>
<p>brings the nutrients, especially oxygen,</p>
<p>but many other things, and then it also,</p>
<p>as it passes the cell, takes the cell&rsquo;s waste,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s sort of the fresh water</p>
<p>and the sewage system in one.</p>
<p>So about blood, what do you use fascinating about blood?</p>
<p>So we talk about the pump that spreads the blood,</p>
<p>but the blood itself.</p>
<p>Right, so the blood itself is sort of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the most important bodily fluid, of course.</p>
<p>From moment to moment, every cell in the body</p>
<p>needs a flow of blood to bring it,</p>
<p>most importantly, oxygen, but also, again,</p>
<p>all the other nutrients and to take away waste,</p>
<p>and if that stops for even a few moments,</p>
<p>you can be in big trouble.</p>
<p>So blood is sort of the most important medium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body.</p>
<p>It does have this kind of all seeing quality to it,</p>
<p>where we can evaluate organs through the blood.</p>
<p>I can tell you about your liver, your heart, your kidney</p>
<p>just by taking a sample of your blood.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like this crystal ball in a way,</p>
<p>and we use it kind of all the time</p>
<p>to assess someone&rsquo;s health, to assess their disease.</p>
<p>Is it also the attack vector for diseases,</p>
<p>for bacteria, for viruses and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So viruses seem to attack either the throat,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but they seem to attack different parts of the body,</p>
<p>depending on how easy it is to access</p>
<p>and how easy it is to get in deep,</p>
<p>depending on what you prefer.</p>
<p>If you want to do a little bit of hard work,</p>
<p>but you get in deep,</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t want to do the hard work,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get in deep,</p>
<p>those are the choices viruses have.</p>
<p>But is blood one of the sort of attack vectors?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like, if you were trying to break into the human body,</p>
<p>like a parasite, a virus, a bacteria, how would you do it?</p>
<p>Like what would be the attack vectors you would explore?</p>
<p>Right, so you got to look for the body&rsquo;s weaknesses,</p>
<p>of course, you know, we have inherent weaknesses,</p>
<p>for instance, like our respiratory tract,</p>
<p>we have to breathe,</p>
<p>we have to get air in from the outside.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the entries into the body.</p>
<p>And so, you know, when we inhale,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a poisonous gas, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an easy way in, you have to breathe,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hold your breath very long,</p>
<p>but, you know, air in our lungs is still kind of contiguous</p>
<p>with the external atmosphere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really inside the body until it does cross</p>
<p>across the lining of the alveoli into the blood,</p>
<p>as you said, that&rsquo;s when it really gets inside.</p>
<p>And the other besides the respiratory tract,</p>
<p>the gastrointestinal tract is another way,</p>
<p>kind of a chink in the armor,</p>
<p>you know, we have to eat, we have to drink,</p>
<p>and therefore we&rsquo;re taking the external world</p>
<p>into ourselves, into our gut,</p>
<p>in order to extract from it what we need</p>
<p>and let the rest kind of flow out.</p>
<p>So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a reason that, you know,</p>
<p>respiratory tract infections</p>
<p>and gastrointestinal infections are kind of the most common</p>
<p>that afflict us because those are the ways in to the body.</p>
<p>So I would definitely pick one of those,</p>
<p>not just be a lazy cold in the nose,</p>
<p>but really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep</p>
<p>in the lungs and get across that barrier into the blood.</p>
<p>But also the whole sex thing that humans do.</p>
<p>So speaking of which, let us go for time</p>
<p>to the genitals chapter.</p>
<p>So what are genitals?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard of those.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve read about a penis and a vagina.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me how those work?</p>
<p>Just asking for a friend,</p>
<p>but also what do you use fascinating about it</p>
<p>and maybe what&rsquo;s misunderstood or little known about them?</p>
<p>Sure, so they&rsquo;re very unique organs, I would say.</p>
<p>One of the things that I like to point out is that,</p>
<p>you know, while every organ from moment to moment</p>
<p>keeps us alive and ensures our survival,</p>
<p>the genitals are in a way the opposite.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t need them from moment to moment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to use them at all.</p>
<p>And in fact, they often make us do stupid things</p>
<p>that are the opposite of kind of enhancing survival.</p>
<p>So, and they, you know, they&rsquo;ve affected the brain</p>
<p>and you can become sort of focused and nuts</p>
<p>based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals.</p>
<p>So they can be dangerous organs too.</p>
<p>But you know, I mean, sexual dimorphism</p>
<p>helps with genetic variability,</p>
<p>as it does in so many other organisms.</p>
<p>You know, you take two people</p>
<p>and mix them together, their genetics,</p>
<p>you just get a lot more variation</p>
<p>and more opportunities to try different genetic codes</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;ll enhance survival</p>
<p>as we talked about sex and death.</p>
<p>I talk about in the book, a lot of,</p>
<p>for instance, the female genital tract,</p>
<p>how the uterus is very unusual</p>
<p>because, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t even sort of wake up</p>
<p>and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s even though babies,</p>
<p>female babies are born with all of the eggs</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ever have in their ovaries already.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just sort of in this stasis</p>
<p>until they start waking up kind of once a month.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this cycle, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much in our bodies that are cyclical and rhythmic,</p>
<p>the heartbeat, the breathing, but menstruation</p>
<p>is kind of a very strange rhythm</p>
<p>that takes over a decade to start.</p>
<p>And only, you know, the rhythm beats once a month,</p>
<p>which is very slow compared</p>
<p>to every other rhythm of the body.</p>
<p>The other unusual thing is, you know, in medicine,</p>
<p>when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,</p>
<p>those are emergencies, right?</p>
<p>When your heart stops, that&rsquo;s a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>You need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.</p>
<p>When your breathing stops, you know,</p>
<p>you need a breathing machine to breathe for you</p>
<p>or something to reverse whatever might be causing</p>
<p>the suppression of your breathing.</p>
<p>But when menstruation stops,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the point of menstruation in the first place.</p>
<p>The whole reason that the uterus grows a lining</p>
<p>and sheds it each month is to one day, you know,</p>
<p>get fertile, the ovum to get fertilized</p>
<p>and for it to implant in the lining,</p>
<p>and then the rhythm ceases.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obviously not a medical emergency,</p>
<p>unlike most other rhythms, you know, cessations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the point of the whole thing in the first place.</p>
<p>So these particular penis and vagina are that whole thing,</p>
<p>the uterus, whatever.</p>
<p>Am I not using the wrong terms?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just keep saying.</p>
<p>You use those terms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more technical, there&rsquo;s parts, various, various parts.</p>
<p>In medical school, you learn every bump</p>
<p>and, you know, every little part of every little organ</p>
<p>including the genitals, so.</p>
<p>I never really thought of it this way, as you said,</p>
<p>is that most organs are kind of full time employees.</p>
<p>Like 24 seven, they&rsquo;re doing something.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some organs,</p>
<p>penis, vagina being representative of this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not functioning all the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only functioning every once in a while</p>
<p>and then get us to do stupid stuff or awesome stuff</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not essential for human survival</p>
<p>on a second by second basis.</p>
<p>And that the whole cyclical nature of the human body,</p>
<p>how many other cycles are on a monthly basis?</p>
<p>Like that far apart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating design</p>
<p>that the human body would do that</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t start until the second decade of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, what do I want to say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of meta planning going on.</p>
<p>Like this is the optimal solution</p>
<p>for the sexual selection mechanism</p>
<p>among like somewhat intelligent species.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s useful to after the brain has developed</p>
<p>sufficiently long to now be making</p>
<p>sexual selection decisions.</p>
<p>Like you need time for this computer,</p>
<p>this really powerful computer to load in the info.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>You also need the body to develop.</p>
<p>A child simply isn&rsquo;t big enough</p>
<p>to be pregnant and deliver another baby.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s animals in which this happens</p>
<p>at a much more accelerated pace in different stages.</p>
<p>Definitely, especially certain kinds of insects,</p>
<p>like Drosophila, a lot of the fruit fly,</p>
<p>a lot of experiments are done on</p>
<p>because their life cycle is so rapid.</p>
<p>A lot of kind of insects and other creatures</p>
<p>are almost ready to mate as soon as they&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>Not us.</p>
<p>Is there any improvements to the design?</p>
<p>So a lot of people are very interested</p>
<p>in these particular body parts.</p>
<p>If you were to sort of step back</p>
<p>as a geneticist, biological designer,</p>
<p>or maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer</p>
<p>trying to build human 2.0 or maybe a robot,</p>
<p>how would you improve the penis and the vagina?</p>
<p>Well, the penis for starters,</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s also discuss the testicles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very important too.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Okay, so they&rsquo;re fragile and they&rsquo;re important</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re hanging off the body in danger basically.</p>
<p>So does that make sense?</p>
<p>You know, they begin in the womb,</p>
<p>they begin inside the abdomen and they slowly descend</p>
<p>and sometimes before birth,</p>
<p>sometimes in the first year of life, sometimes never,</p>
<p>they pop out of the body and end up hanging in the scrotum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason because the chemical reactions</p>
<p>that create sperm function best</p>
<p>at a few degrees cooler than body temperature.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you might notice in the warm weather,</p>
<p>they might hang further down and in the cold weather,</p>
<p>they scrunch themselves up to get closer to the body</p>
<p>to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard, you know,</p>
<p>if you could create a sperm production mechanism</p>
<p>that did not rely on that lower temperature,</p>
<p>that would be great.</p>
<p>Keep them inside the body protected like the ovaries are.</p>
<p>Oh, then you wouldn&rsquo;t rely on the lower temperature.</p>
<p>I thought you meant create some kind of weird internal</p>
<p>cooling mechanism.</p>
<p>No, well, I guess that would be one solution,</p>
<p>but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction</p>
<p>or, you know, would not be reliant</p>
<p>on the lower temperature, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;d be great to design a spermatogenesis</p>
<p>or a sperm production process that would function best</p>
<p>at body temperature and then we can keep</p>
<p>those delicate organs inside the body</p>
<p>and not have them hanging out in danger.</p>
<p>Or maybe the argument for this design</p>
<p>is maybe it&rsquo;s nice to put them in danger</p>
<p>so you are constantly concerned about it.</p>
<p>Could be, maybe that&rsquo;s beneficial for male psychology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a psychological element here</p>
<p>about the evolution that could be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the testicles.</p>
<p>Penis?</p>
<p>A better way to do it, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty good as it is.</p>
<p>You know, it kind of, when it&rsquo;s time for it to work,</p>
<p>it grows and stiffens and when it&rsquo;s time for it not to work,</p>
<p>it kind of shrinks and hangs out.</p>
<p>Saw this on a Seinfeld episode, so I know how it works.</p>
<p>Shrinkage.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a good one.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s also a bit unique,</p>
<p>I suppose, that the way it has this erectile tissue.</p>
<p>Actually, they&rsquo;re similar in the mouth</p>
<p>of certain baleen whales, there&rsquo;s a certain similar</p>
<p>kind of erectile tissue that helps cool them off</p>
<p>because they have so much blubber</p>
<p>and create so much heat in moving around and feeding</p>
<p>that they have actually a similar,</p>
<p>similar to the penis organ in their mouth</p>
<p>that helps cool their bodies, because it&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>They have to store all that blubber for fuel,</p>
<p>but it makes them too hot, so as a compensation,</p>
<p>they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What about vagina?</p>
<p>You know, the fact that miscarriages sometimes happen</p>
<p>because of sexually transmitted diseases,</p>
<p>because of trauma, you know, it&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>if the uterus where the growing fetus is</p>
<p>is sort of even more protected from those things.</p>
<p>You know, I guess that&rsquo;s a side effect of the fact</p>
<p>that people still have sex when they&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>or still, you know, exposed to injury.</p>
<p>If there was a way to make it more protected,</p>
<p>perhaps that would be even better.</p>
<p>I did see an article recently about artificial wombs,</p>
<p>which are rapidly becoming a reality,</p>
<p>and in animal studies, they&rsquo;re able to prolong</p>
<p>the gestation of a fetus by a month in an artificial womb.</p>
<p>Can you explain the artificial aspect</p>
<p>of the artificial womb?</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s, I believe it acts almost</p>
<p>like a heart lung bypass machine,</p>
<p>so when someone&rsquo;s getting like bypass surgery,</p>
<p>their heart is stopped, literally they throw ice</p>
<p>in the chest and they give a potassium infusion</p>
<p>through the blood, which stops the heart,</p>
<p>but the blood is run through a machine</p>
<p>that basically does the work of the heart</p>
<p>and lungs together, gets oxygen into the blood</p>
<p>and then pushes it back into the body.</p>
<p>So I believe it&rsquo;s a sort of similar mechanism</p>
<p>to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s just not inside the body of a parent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in some kind of other device,</p>
<p>but I think that science is gonna rapidly improve.</p>
<p>One benefit is, you know, babies are born premature,</p>
<p>and while, you know, neonatology is able</p>
<p>to continuously kind of lower the age of viability</p>
<p>through better technology and understanding</p>
<p>how, what you can, medicines and other things</p>
<p>you can do to premature babies when they&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>you know, ideally, if let&rsquo;s say premature labor begins,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop it, that baby&rsquo;s coming out one way</p>
<p>or the other, if you could just then stick it</p>
<p>into an artificial womb where it can continue</p>
<p>its development, that would save a whole host</p>
<p>of problems, often those babies born very early</p>
<p>suffer from damage to various organs,</p>
<p>including the brain, you know, for the rest of their life,</p>
<p>so that could be a very important technology.</p>
<p>So some aspects of the human body,</p>
<p>we can develop technologies that outsource them,</p>
<p>sort of offload some of the stress</p>
<p>and the workload from the human body to do it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like dialysis does that for kidneys, you know,</p>
<p>people can live decades without kidneys</p>
<p>as long as they get dialysis, which does the work for them.</p>
<p>Not every organ can do that, for instance,</p>
<p>the liver, there&rsquo;s no dialysis version for the liver,</p>
<p>like if your liver fails, you need a liver transplant</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s gonna do it for you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s first artificial womb for humans</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking at a picture of what looks like</p>
<p>gigantic balloons.</p>
<p>Matrix, here we come.</p>
<p>This is very matrixy.</p>
<p>How are they floating?</p>
<p>What are we even looking at?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s giant red spheres.</p>
<p>This really looks like the matrix.</p>
<p>I wonder where it&rsquo;s from,</p>
<p>so there seems to be a paper on this too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know too much about it, but I did see that there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s advancing very rapidly.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s first artificial womb for humans.</p>
<p>Scientists in the Netherlands say they&rsquo;re within 10 years</p>
<p>of developing an artificial womb</p>
<p>that could save the lives of premature babies.</p>
<p>Premature birth before 37 weeks is globally</p>
<p>the biggest cause of death among newborns,</p>
<p>but the development also raises ethical questions</p>
<p>about the future of baby making and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Wow, we&rsquo;re going to be facing a lot of ethical questions</p>
<p>as we start to mess with human biology.</p>
<p>In an effort to help human biology,</p>
<p>we might start to mess with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be very interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take steps towards the matrix.</p>
<p>All right, what about the neighbors, poop, feces?</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of interesting stories</p>
<p>in that particular output as well.</p>
<p>What to you is fascinating?</p>
<p>What to you maybe is misunderstood</p>
<p>or little known about poop?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hilarious, for one thing, that we do it.</p>
<p>The word is great as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different words.</p>
<p>I do, when I&rsquo;m talking to the parents</p>
<p>of pediatric patients, I use the word poop.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often, when I&rsquo;m talking to adult patients,</p>
<p>try to choose a more mature word.</p>
<p>But poop is amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s sort of the dirtiest, the most vile,</p>
<p>the most hated aspect of our bodies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the grossest, we don&rsquo;t want to think about it,</p>
<p>talk about it, have it anywhere near our food</p>
<p>or in social interactions with good reason.</p>
<p>I mentioned gastrointestinal infections</p>
<p>are one of the most common infections</p>
<p>the human body suffers from.</p>
<p>And the way they spread from person to person,</p>
<p>grossly enough, is referred to as the fecal oral route,</p>
<p>which means a bit of someone&rsquo;s stool</p>
<p>is getting into your, you&rsquo;re swallowing it,</p>
<p>through water supply.</p>
<p>For instance, diarrhea is actually quite</p>
<p>a brilliant mechanism of these microbes, right?</p>
<p>If you, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in the intestine of one person,</p>
<p>your goal is to get into the intestines of another person.</p>
<p>Brilliant to just trick their intestines</p>
<p>into secreting all this fluid into the intestines</p>
<p>to increase the volume of stool and its runniness</p>
<p>so that when they do poop, it gets into the water supply</p>
<p>and then everyone else kind of ends up</p>
<p>getting infected as well.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Just the same way like tuberculosis or coronavirus</p>
<p>kind of infects your lungs and makes you cough</p>
<p>and you send it out into the air</p>
<p>and it ends up in other people&rsquo;s lungs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all evolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So diarrhea is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most intelligent things we can do</p>
<p>as an entirety of an organism,</p>
<p>not just the particular cognitive organism,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re made up of bacteria and viruses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of visitors and so on.</p>
<p>As the entirety of the system,</p>
<p>diarrhea is one of our better accomplishments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder, why is poop funny?</p>
<p>I think a lot of that is socially constructed,</p>
<p>just how it&rsquo;s sort of supposed to be hidden away</p>
<p>yet something we always do,</p>
<p>something we chuckle about as children.</p>
<p>But even in healthcare,</p>
<p>it becomes this big topic of conversation</p>
<p>because you end up talking about it constantly.</p>
<p>Like in the ER, people come in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re complete strangers.</p>
<p>Sometimes like a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother</p>
<p>and all of a sudden I have to ask her all about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Like, is she straining?</p>
<p>What color is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the consistency?</p>
<p>Does it float on top of the water more than it should?</p>
<p>Is it hard to flush?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a million different questions you learn</p>
<p>as a medical student and you&rsquo;re like this poop detective</p>
<p>when people come in with issues.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s funny, I guess,</p>
<p>in the exam room with the doctor patient relationship,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of no barriers.</p>
<p>You talk about everything</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about the most intimate details</p>
<p>of a person&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>even though you just met them a second ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so different than normal social interactions.</p>
<p>Yet there is this social aspect.</p>
<p>A lot of what I do is social.</p>
<p>It seems like doctors, what they do is mostly scientific,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s just relating to another person</p>
<p>and you have to maintain your professional demeanor</p>
<p>and this normal human level interaction,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re talking about poop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a skill, that&rsquo;s an art and a science.</p>
<p>Well, okay, actually I wanna linger on that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a fan of just diving into conversations</p>
<p>right away with strangers, just getting no small talk.</p>
<p>And this is the ultimate, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the ultimate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one version of no small talk.</p>
<p>You get right to the point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful from a psychology perspective.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a kind of therapist</p>
<p>or you have the power to be a therapist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean just about the medical condition of the body,</p>
<p>but the psychological.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much fear connected to this concern.</p>
<p>Also, self doubt, insecurities,</p>
<p>even sort of existential thoughts about your mortality,</p>
<p>all of those things are right there in the room.</p>
<p>So I think one way doctors deal with that</p>
<p>is they kind of have this cold way about them.</p>
<p>They almost have like dual mode.</p>
<p>One is like, I&rsquo;m going to be friendly on the surface</p>
<p>and cold about the brutal honesty of the biology.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there&rsquo;s like a skillful middle ground,</p>
<p>this dangerous place where you can help people</p>
<p>deal with their psychological insecurities,</p>
<p>concerns, fears, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is that just really tough to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a huge part of being a doctor</p>
<p>is dealing with the psychological aspects</p>
<p>of whatever&rsquo;s going on with the patient&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>I mean, in the ER, you deal with psychiatric emergencies</p>
<p>kind of left and right more than ever these days.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge issue,</p>
<p>not to mention sort of drug use, alcohol related stuff,</p>
<p>that gets into sort of psychology</p>
<p>and the human love of intoxicants</p>
<p>and changing the brain&rsquo;s chemistry and habit, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creatures of habit and that plays in as well.</p>
<p>I mean, a big part of, for instance, pediatrics</p>
<p>is reassuring parents and kind of convincing them,</p>
<p>giving them the confidence that what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with their child is not serious, will go away on its own,</p>
<p>does not need any particular intervention.</p>
<p>And, but adults too, reassurance is a huge part of the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the ER, you see humanity at its most raw.</p>
<p>I feel like you get this tremendous insight into people,</p>
<p>how they live, what they worry about,</p>
<p>what they think about, how their body works</p>
<p>and also how their mind works</p>
<p>that you almost don&rsquo;t see anywhere else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting place to work.</p>
<p>And also the way our society is shaped,</p>
<p>the ER is where people go for almost everything.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re suicidal, they come to the ER.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re too high on drugs to walk, they come to the ER.</p>
<p>Children who have been abused, sexually abused,</p>
<p>physically abused, come to the ER for us to investigate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the all purpose waste bin</p>
<p>for the dregs of society, what people do to themselves</p>
<p>and what they do to other people.</p>
<p>You mentioned you&rsquo;re interested in the darkness of humanity</p>
<p>and made me think of the ER where you really see</p>
<p>what human life is like in the ER.</p>
<p>Okay, you tweet about, you write about,</p>
<p>you think about the emergency room ER.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>Just the little window you give to that world</p>
<p>is fascinating.</p>
<p>What lessons about humanity do you draw</p>
<p>from this place where you&rsquo;re so near to death?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much chaos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much variety of what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>So little information or the urgent nature</p>
<p>of the information inflows such that you can&rsquo;t really reason</p>
<p>sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You have to act fast and then everybody&rsquo;s freaking out.</p>
<p>Can you just speak to the human condition</p>
<p>that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you do see all those things.</p>
<p>I think on one end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>it is this very unique place</p>
<p>where you get all these unique insights.</p>
<p>On the other end, it can become a ho hum workplace</p>
<p>just like any other, which is sort of surprising.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, humans seem to be able to get used</p>
<p>to almost anything and doctors can get ho hum used to,</p>
<p>oh, dying of a heart attack, oh, actively in labor</p>
<p>and the baby&rsquo;s half out.</p>
<p>Oh, just ho hum, I know what to do, going about my job</p>
<p>and go home and have dinner with my family</p>
<p>and not think too much about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I do try to maintain both my fascination.</p>
<p>I think writers in general tend to think more</p>
<p>about what they see, write more about what they see,</p>
<p>maybe draw connections with what they see to other things.</p>
<p>So I do think that writer&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>does help me kind of maintain my fascination</p>
<p>and my kind of more of an insightful perspective</p>
<p>than just a ho hum, water cooler conversation.</p>
<p>But you do see a lot.</p>
<p>In a way, medical problems are sort of</p>
<p>the great equalizer, right?</p>
<p>Class, race, culture, background,</p>
<p>the failings of the human body, the way it fails</p>
<p>and what we can do to help in those situations</p>
<p>is almost universal.</p>
<p>I always like this quote from, Chekhov was a doctor</p>
<p>and a writer and he treated a lot of peasants</p>
<p>very low class and also treated a lot of aristocrats.</p>
<p>And he wrote that they all have the same ugly bodies</p>
<p>basically, which I think is really right on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of, you can see people</p>
<p>underneath a superficial layer of clothing,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the most expensive clothing</p>
<p>bought from the fanciest places,</p>
<p>but underneath their body is still failing in the same way</p>
<p>and they still have the same anxieties, the same worry</p>
<p>about mortality, the same concerns about why their poop</p>
<p>turned green today, all these things</p>
<p>that they bring to the table.</p>
<p>So in a way, it is this great equalizer</p>
<p>where people are kind of all the same in some ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like people sometimes, class, money,</p>
<p>fame, power, makes you for a time forget</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just a meat vehicle.</p>
<p>And just as good and just as bad</p>
<p>as the other meat vehicles all around you.</p>
<p>In that sense, there&rsquo;s this question sometimes raised,</p>
<p>are some people better than others?</p>
<p>And I usually answer no to that question because of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, some people might be better at math,</p>
<p>some people might be better at music.</p>
<p>But in the end, we&rsquo;re just meat bags.</p>
<p>Beautiful as we are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a poem that just, a small tangent I want to take,</p>
<p>I just saw it, Just Acting, that you have written.</p>
<p>I have to, would you classify it as a poem?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At first, if I may read it, at first you enter the clinic,</p>
<p>shoulders weighed down by white coat pockets,</p>
<p>book stuffed, timid, you act out a role,</p>
<p>your white coat, a costume, your questions, a script,</p>
<p>your demeanor, a rehearsed act.</p>
<p>No one is going to buy this.</p>
<p>But then, as you play the role again and again,</p>
<p>repeating the lines and the motions,</p>
<p>the script slowly dissolves</p>
<p>and the interaction becomes thoughtless.</p>
<p>And the rehearsed act slowly fades into a profession.</p>
<p>You suddenly find yourself unable to tell</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re still acting or if you&rsquo;re doing it for real.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re a doctor.</p>
<p>Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard,</p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital of Medicine</p>
<p>and Pediatrics Department.</p>
<p>Beautiful, so that is what it is to be a doctor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just acting.</p>
<p>Fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>Exactly, fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>And I think, I imagine every medical student</p>
<p>has this feeling when they first go into a room.</p>
<p>Like I talked about asking this nice old lady</p>
<p>about the color of her poop for the first time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>Like, does she believe I&rsquo;m a doctor?</p>
<p>You know, this just feels absurd.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s, again, ho hum, becomes normal.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s not a sperm chapter in your book.</p>
<p>You mentioned offline that this is a second and a third book</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on all about sperm.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But, or maybe I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Humor tends to make way for reality.</p>
<p>So the tweet was that a human, an average human male</p>
<p>produces 500 billion sperm, I believe,</p>
<p>which is about four to five times more</p>
<p>than the number of people who have ever lived.</p>
<p>And each of those sperm is genetically unique</p>
<p>so you can think of them, you can kind of imagine</p>
<p>the possible humans they could have created.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all different.</p>
<p>They have similarities, of course,</p>
<p>but they have peculiarities that make them different.</p>
<p>And you can think of all the different trajectories,</p>
<p>all the Einsteins, the Feynmans, the Hitlers,</p>
<p>and all the people who would have died during childbirth,</p>
<p>would have died early in their years</p>
<p>given the different diseases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>An average human, yeah, we&rsquo;re all winners</p>
<p>of a very competitive race.</p>
<p>So the people who make it, we&rsquo;re winners, hashtag winning.</p>
<p>Is there something that you find fascinating,</p>
<p>interesting, beautiful, ugly, surprising about sperm?</p>
<p>I think sperm is, yes, it is a very interesting bodily fluid.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll write about it in a second or third book,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see, but I guess sperm is interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of the only projectile bodily fluid</p>
<p>from the body.</p>
<p>Vomit can be projectile.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s a diseased state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the expected kind of normal healthy state.</p>
<p>Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or no?</p>
<p>True, I guess it&rsquo;s, yeah, there&rsquo;s some particles in the air.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not a fluid, I mean, not a liquid, but true.</p>
<p>I mean, cough, in addition to sneeze, right?</p>
<p>Sneeze is how our nose gets rid of something</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>Cough is how our lungs get rid of something</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs</p>
<p>get rid of something that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>All projectiles sometimes in their own way.</p>
<p>Sperm is sort of interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s created with the food for its journey.</p>
<p>Sperm mostly feed off of fructose, a kind of sugar,</p>
<p>for the few days that they live inside</p>
<p>the female genital tract.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sort of, I like comparing our genitals</p>
<p>to the genitals of the plant world, which is flowers,</p>
<p>and in the same way that a touch me not, for instance,</p>
<p>the kind of flower where when you brush up against it,</p>
<p>it sort of launches seeds into the distance</p>
<p>to try to survive in a way kind of the sperm</p>
<p>is doing something similar,</p>
<p>launched into the female genital tract,</p>
<p>and then all trying to find this,</p>
<p>competing against each other to find this egg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>And when you learn about it from the biological perspective,</p>
<p>the most amazing thing is how many things can go wrong,</p>
<p>just in the sperm not surviving long enough</p>
<p>for it making it to the egg,</p>
<p>and then some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of astounding that it works as often as it does,</p>
<p>and I think the lesson there is just that</p>
<p>people have a lot of sex, and so statistics just favor</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna work out a good number of times.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there might be intelligence in the design</p>
<p>of just the sheer number of sperm.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s yet another way</p>
<p>to inject variety into the system.</p>
<p>And redundancy, I guess.</p>
<p>We have two kidneys, we have two hands.</p>
<p>If we lose one, we can still go on.</p>
<p>We have however many millions of sperm</p>
<p>get sort of launched in every ejaculation</p>
<p>is if a bunch fail or don&rsquo;t make it inside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s papers on this, by the way,</p>
<p>that I read for some reason.</p>
<p>Not read, but skimmed for some reason,</p>
<p>which is talking about which sperm usually wins.</p>
<p>Like what are the characteristics of sperms</p>
<p>that are winning, and it&rsquo;s not the fastest.</p>
<p>So apparently there&rsquo;s some kind of slaughter</p>
<p>that happens early on, people will correct me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the fastest.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of it&rsquo;s the luckiest.</p>
<p>It really is, like the body tries</p>
<p>to make it a random selection.</p>
<p>It tries to make it fair in making it as random as possible.</p>
<p>Interesting, and also interesting</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re fueled by fructose.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think about that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re a carb loaded athlete.</p>
<p>Right, with food for the journey.</p>
<p>Food for the journey, because I&rsquo;m somebody</p>
<p>that actually does a lot of running on,</p>
<p>I guess you would call me a fat adapted athlete.</p>
<p>So I do sort of meat heavy diet.</p>
<p>And so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t need any carbs, any glucose,</p>
<p>any of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re very low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think that sperm are like,</p>
<p>nope, they&rsquo;re total bros.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the gym, sprint, performance,</p>
<p>short term performance is everything.</p>
<p>All right, well, that sperm, returning to the liver,</p>
<p>the place that deals with all our poor decisions.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Many of them.</p>
<p>Many of our poor decisions.</p>
<p>Is there, you said that the liver does quite a few things.</p>
<p>What to you is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s primary function seems to be</p>
<p>as the sort of gatekeeper for what we eat and absorb.</p>
<p>You know, the entire gastrointestinal tract</p>
<p>from the esophagus to the rectum,</p>
<p>the blood flows from it, not back to the heart,</p>
<p>but to the liver where it&rsquo;s first examined,</p>
<p>kind of things are evaluated, packaged,</p>
<p>you know, processed, detoxified, perhaps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this great overseer</p>
<p>of what we digest and absorb.</p>
<p>And so it kind of keeps track of what&rsquo;s coming in,</p>
<p>you know, the outside world that comes in</p>
<p>and will become part of us.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s why partly the liver suffers</p>
<p>sometimes the injury from certain toxins like alcohol.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the liver is also the place,</p>
<p>as I said, it metabolizes things too.</p>
<p>So it metabolizes alcohol</p>
<p>and why it can be injured by alcohol.</p>
<p>It metabolizes drugs like Tylenol,</p>
<p>which is why Tylenol can be very toxic to the liver</p>
<p>when taken as an overdose.</p>
<p>So the liver, you know, even beyond that,</p>
<p>the liver produces a lot of different, you know,</p>
<p>things that float in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>It packages cholesterol and fats</p>
<p>and sends them to where they&rsquo;re needed.</p>
<p>It deals with protein in the blood.</p>
<p>It deals with clotting factors in the blood,</p>
<p>helping the blood clot, you know,</p>
<p>processes things like bilirubin and other things</p>
<p>that really, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>is like 15 organs wrapped into one.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s sort of the biggest internal organ.</p>
<p>The skin&rsquo;s bigger, but it&rsquo;s not an internal organ.</p>
<p>Right, the biggest organ in the human body is the skin.</p>
<p>Right, but the liver&rsquo;s the biggest internal organ</p>
<p>and it really is a powerhouse and does a lot,</p>
<p>which is why when people suffer from liver failure,</p>
<p>kind of everything goes wrong in a way.</p>
<p>And in terms of replacing organs,</p>
<p>what are organs that are easily replaceable,</p>
<p>which are not?</p>
<p>Like on the list of things that are hard to replace</p>
<p>and not, what would you put in number one?</p>
<p>What would you put like at the bottom?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say the kidneys are, you know, nothing&rsquo;s easy,</p>
<p>but kidneys are easiest in a way.</p>
<p>Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there</p>
<p>is that other people have two of them</p>
<p>and can give one to you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to wait for people to die,</p>
<p>which is the case with hearts and livers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can take a part of a liver</p>
<p>from someone who&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>and the liver does have this kind of mythological ability</p>
<p>to regenerate itself.</p>
<p>In the myth of Prometheus, he&rsquo;s chained to a rock</p>
<p>and the bird eats his liver every day</p>
<p>and it grows back every day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually biologically accurate.</p>
<p>Not that you can completely get rid of it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll appear again,</p>
<p>but when pieces of it are removed or injured,</p>
<p>it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say the kidneys,</p>
<p>the fact that there are more around,</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often just, you don&rsquo;t have to put a transplanted kidney</p>
<p>where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen.</p>
<p>You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a smaller organ.</p>
<p>The liver would be hard because it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And I guess we just have the most experience</p>
<p>with kidney transplants because they are the most common.</p>
<p>And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.</p>
<p>Brain, as far as I know, hasn&rsquo;t been successfully done.</p>
<p>The heart is done.</p>
<p>And definitely I&rsquo;ve evaluated a lot of patients</p>
<p>with a heart transplant.</p>
<p>It does work pretty well.</p>
<p>The mechanical heart substitutes</p>
<p>are also advancing quite rapidly these days.</p>
<p>For a failing heart,</p>
<p>there are certain kinds of devices</p>
<p>they can surgically implant.</p>
<p>Like when a failing heart isn&rsquo;t able to push hard enough,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s the heart&rsquo;s job is pushing blood</p>
<p>with sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.</p>
<p>When it fails, there are actually these devices</p>
<p>you can strap onto the heart to help it pump harder.</p>
<p>Those are rapidly advancing.</p>
<p>Many of those were not available even 10 years ago</p>
<p>when I got out of med school and now they&rsquo;re commonly used.</p>
<p>So maybe heart transplant won&rsquo;t be as necessary</p>
<p>in the future if those mechanical things do advance.</p>
<p>And as I said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.</p>
<p>So perhaps it would be the easiest organ</p>
<p>to replace with some mechanical device.</p>
<p>Now for something completely different,</p>
<p>returning to testicles for a time.</p>
<p>You posted a Instagram post of testicles as food.</p>
<p>Perhaps eating them doesn&rsquo;t help libido</p>
<p>because ingested testosterone is totally metabolized</p>
<p>in the liver, returning to our liver,</p>
<p>leaving none to reach the bloodstream.</p>
<p>That is why testosterone only comes as injection</p>
<p>or topical foam, not as pills.</p>
<p>On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>can be absorbed orally, hence the pill.</p>
<p>But testosterone is mostly responsible</p>
<p>for libido in women too.</p>
<p>I was not expecting for this biology lesson</p>
<p>when I was looking at an Instagram picture of,</p>
<p>are we looking at testicles?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are these like, which species?</p>
<p>I believe all those are from cows.</p>
<p>From cows, cow testicles.</p>
<p>Cows are technically female, so bulls.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, speaking of which, just we&rsquo;ll jump around a bit,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also traveled the world quite a bit.</p>
<p>What is the craziest food you&rsquo;ve eaten across the world?</p>
<p>What have you learned about the extremes</p>
<p>of the culinary arts by traveling the world?</p>
<p>I would say, I guess I&rsquo;ve always been extra fascinated</p>
<p>with the diets of natives of the far north.</p>
<p>I spent some time there in Russia and in Alaska</p>
<p>and always loved their diet.</p>
<p>So when I worked in Alaska in emergency room</p>
<p>and did some other travels in Arctic Alaska,</p>
<p>and they eat a lot of fat.</p>
<p>Traditionally before contact,</p>
<p>more than half of all calories in the Inupiat Eskimo diet</p>
<p>came from blubber, marine mammal fat,</p>
<p>or also fat from fish, fat from ducks</p>
<p>and other birds that go up there to mate in the summer.</p>
<p>So things like raw whale blubber</p>
<p>was especially interesting for me and very exciting.</p>
<p>You know, I had some beluga whale chowder, things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just all these very unusual dishes.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a dish called Mikiyak,</p>
<p>which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,</p>
<p>which is quite delicious actually.</p>
<p>So is it cooked, is it eaten raw?</p>
<p>How do they like their fat?</p>
<p>Like in the same way up north in Russia, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>So they often eat it raw.</p>
<p>So the raw whale blubber is called Muktuk</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s often just sliced thin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of cold, but not frozen often when they eat it</p>
<p>and they slice it thin.</p>
<p>And a lot of people assume it would be very chewy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that chewy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite pleasant actually</p>
<p>and has this kind of sea smell to it as you&rsquo;re eating it.</p>
<p>I quite like it.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the culinary culture like?</p>
<p>Meaning, is it just source of energy or is it art?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, you know, traditionally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of cooking in the Arctic.</p>
<p>A lot of things are eaten raw,</p>
<p>partly because there&rsquo;s not a lot of fuel for making fires.</p>
<p>So they will, you know,</p>
<p>some of the big rivers in Russia, for instance,</p>
<p>that flow north, they will bring trees,</p>
<p>you know, dead trees and logs up to the north</p>
<p>and they can get some wood that way.</p>
<p>And same thing in some of the rivers</p>
<p>kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.</p>
<p>You do get some trees,</p>
<p>but just not enough to really produce a culinary art</p>
<p>that requires cooking with heat.</p>
<p>You know, they do have traditionally blubber lamps</p>
<p>where the blubbers of seals and whales are used</p>
<p>to create a little flame.</p>
<p>Often that&rsquo;s for light and for a little bit of heat</p>
<p>and less for cooking.</p>
<p>But eating things raw is definitely a huge part</p>
<p>of the culture there.</p>
<p>And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip</p>
<p>out on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska.</p>
<p>And two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me</p>
<p>were kind of talking about how eating things raw</p>
<p>is sort of the most essential characteristic</p>
<p>of Inupiat culture.</p>
<p>And the one guy who&rsquo;s half white, half Inupiat,</p>
<p>said people often doubt his ethnicity</p>
<p>because he looks like a white guy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;ll, you know, bite the head off of a raw bird</p>
<p>to show them that he is truly Inupiat, is what he said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you prove you&rsquo;re legit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at an Instagram pic.</p>
<p>As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat</p>
<p>as the most maligned of all body parts</p>
<p>and the culprit in an obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant</p>
<p>health and survival.</p>
<p>In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic,</p>
<p>especially human life, is basically a tale of fat.</p>
<p>And in Barrow, what&rsquo;s A.K.?</p>
<p>Alaska.</p>
<p>Alaska, okay.</p>
<p>A lawn covered with a whale blubber</p>
<p>is still equivalent of a plush green lawn</p>
<p>in temperature suburbia, swelling in its owner with pride.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>is a lawn full of whale blubber.</p>
<p>A beautiful, and this, so this is,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of calories there.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And this can feed a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>This was like, I was a kid in a candy store, basically.</p>
<p>I rounded a corner in Barrow.</p>
<p>So when people do get a whale</p>
<p>during the spring whaling season,</p>
<p>they raise a flag or the whaling captain</p>
<p>raises a flag over his house</p>
<p>and everyone in town is welcome to come try some.</p>
<p>And so before I went inside to try some,</p>
<p>I was kinda playing around with blubber</p>
<p>and I saw the, this is a bowhead whale.</p>
<p>I saw its heart, which was huge,</p>
<p>like the size of a yoga ball.</p>
<p>And that was, for me, just like amazing.</p>
<p>I spent probably the next 45 minutes</p>
<p>just looking at all aspects of it.</p>
<p>And the stump of aorta that was attached to it</p>
<p>was the size of my thigh.</p>
<p>That was really fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar Alaska and Northern Russia,</p>
<p>like Siberia and out there.</p>
<p>So where were you?</p>
<p>I think you have some pics from that time.</p>
<p>Where were you in Russia?</p>
<p>So I spent a lot of time in kind of Western Russia as well,</p>
<p>but I did take two trips to Kamchatka,</p>
<p>including Northern Kamchatka.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go far enough,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to Chukotka, for instance,</p>
<p>until more recently when I was a ship doctor</p>
<p>on a wildlife cruise that sailed from Anadyr, Russia,</p>
<p>up to, through the Bering Strait into Wrangell Island.</p>
<p>And we stopped in some villages in Chukotka</p>
<p>and I got a chance to try some whale and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Northern Kamchatka, where it&rsquo;s more the Koryak</p>
<p>are the indigenous people.</p>
<p>They do a lot of seal hunting,</p>
<p>so I had a lot of seal blubber,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t believe they do any whale hunting quite there.</p>
<p>But the Chukchi in a way are sort of, you know,</p>
<p>similar to the Inupiat in their diet and their life ways.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone&rsquo;s diet, all these people&rsquo;s diet</p>
<p>has changed dramatically in the last 100 years,</p>
<p>as it has for actually everyone</p>
<p>living in kind of modern societies.</p>
<p>But for them, perhaps more than anyone else</p>
<p>since their diet was the most extreme,</p>
<p>I think of any human culture on earth.</p>
<p>Just to stay on the wild travel you did,</p>
<p>and I should say, I&rsquo;m using the word travel,</p>
<p>but it really, you were a doctor there.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, can you just comment on the decision</p>
<p>to go to such places and to help people,</p>
<p>to be a doctor there?</p>
<p>What was the motivation?</p>
<p>What was the thinking behind it?</p>
<p>Well, I think I got the travel bug</p>
<p>before I ever went to medical school</p>
<p>and even wanted to be a doctor.</p>
<p>So right after college, I kind of wasn&rsquo;t very into college,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t enjoy things, kind of wanted to get out there</p>
<p>and see the world, get out of New York City</p>
<p>where I was a student at NYU.</p>
<p>The first thing I did after finishing college</p>
<p>was I was invited to be an intern at a research center</p>
<p>in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>I spent six months there on my first trip</p>
<p>and went back four more times to Russia,</p>
<p>traveled all over, including to Kamchatka twice</p>
<p>and other parts of the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never heard of cities like Petrozavodsk</p>
<p>and Syktyvkar and Pskov.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know a word could start with P, S, K,</p>
<p>like the city of Pskov, but it can.</p>
<p>And I was sort of fascinated.</p>
<p>I was actually studying</p>
<p>the international environmental movement</p>
<p>and how it came to Russia</p>
<p>after the fall of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and how organizations like Greenpeace</p>
<p>and World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank</p>
<p>are trying to kind of push the timber industry,</p>
<p>which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path.</p>
<p>And so I was sort of evaluating how is it working?</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>And that seems like such a little niche,</p>
<p>such a small detail about Russian society,</p>
<p>but in a way, researching that in depth</p>
<p>was almost this window into the entire country</p>
<p>and the history in a place I knew nothing about.</p>
<p>And I learned the language, traveled all over the country,</p>
<p>got to know the food, the history, the literature.</p>
<p>It was just an immersive and amazing</p>
<p>and life changing experience</p>
<p>that made me want to see every spot on the globe, basically,</p>
<p>and learn about every culture.</p>
<p>So I took that desire with me to medical school.</p>
<p>I decided I would go to medical school.</p>
<p>And from the very beginning,</p>
<p>I was intent on traveling around the world.</p>
<p>So a lot of my career has been fashioned</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m practicing medicine in a place</p>
<p>with an interesting geographic context,</p>
<p>an interesting place with an interesting cultural context.</p>
<p>And that just makes it more interesting, I find.</p>
<p>Not only are medical services often more needed</p>
<p>in these remote and rural parts of the country and world,</p>
<p>so I feel like I&rsquo;m taking my knowledge</p>
<p>and education experience to places where it&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>but also for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just such an enlightening experience,</p>
<p>the way culture, history, geography, climate</p>
<p>affects medical disease,</p>
<p>but just getting to know the people,</p>
<p>getting to know their culture,</p>
<p>being a very useful traveler</p>
<p>by providing medical services in that place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s taken me to Arctic Alaska,</p>
<p>to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota.</p>
<p>I currently work in a few different parts</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania, Appalachia,</p>
<p>which for me is a unique geography and culture</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t grow up with, wasn&rsquo;t familiar with.</p>
<p>So in some ways, it&rsquo;s exotic for me as well.</p>
<p>I worked in other places too, like Kolkata, India, Nepal.</p>
<p>Just I think my love of travel has shaped my medical career</p>
<p>and being a doctor does give you these opportunities</p>
<p>to go to places and travel in a unique way</p>
<p>through the medical profession.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a documentary,</p>
<p>Happy People Here in the Taiga or something like that.</p>
<p>I think Warner Herzog voices it.</p>
<p>It tells a story of a simple life of survival in the taiga</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re trapping for food</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an alcoholism problem too as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a very basic life of survival,</p>
<p>of loneliness, of desperation,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s a, I think the underlying claim</p>
<p>of the documentary is that that simple life</p>
<p>that simple life actually has a kind</p>
<p>of simple happiness to it, hence the name Happy People.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the life that people live in those places</p>
<p>when it may be simpler than you would</p>
<p>in a sort of big city life?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely very different for sure.</p>
<p>You know, I guess I found like in some</p>
<p>of the remote villages of Kamchatka,</p>
<p>I was actually surprised how similar they were</p>
<p>in that I saw the same family strife,</p>
<p>the same fights, the same kind of pairing of relationships</p>
<p>and bickering and politics.</p>
<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m from the New Jersey suburbs</p>
<p>and being in this remote village of Northern Kamchatka,</p>
<p>I remember writing an email to my friend</p>
<p>about how just it seemed so similar,</p>
<p>even though on the surface it was this exotic other world,</p>
<p>the incredible material know how they must have</p>
<p>to get their food from the land.</p>
<p>You know, that the number of animal species,</p>
<p>plant species, the behaviors of the animals,</p>
<p>seasons, how to live that way.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s more complicated in a way</p>
<p>that I find fascinating how people live on the land</p>
<p>and the knowledge and experience it takes</p>
<p>to do it well and survive.</p>
<p>You know, obviously other aspects of modern life</p>
<p>in a city are much more complicated</p>
<p>than they would be there, but I guess it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that was something that struck me too,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s simpler in some ways,</p>
<p>but more complicated in other ways.</p>
<p>So some of the complexity that happens in life</p>
<p>is originated from humans, not from the technology</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff around us.</p>
<p>You can take the human out of modernity,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still human.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still human, and they fill the empty space</p>
<p>with their own human complexities.</p>
<p>Are there people that just stand out,</p>
<p>memorable people, memorable experiences from those places?</p>
<p>Some people that maybe made you smile, made you cry,</p>
<p>changed who you are as a man, changed who you are</p>
<p>as a doctor, anything jumps to mind?</p>
<p>I think, you know, when I was, it was interesting,</p>
<p>when I was in Russia, I found that most of the people</p>
<p>I hung out with were old women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why.</p>
<p>I mean, actually I didn&rsquo;t meet a lot of old men in Russia,</p>
<p>which might speak to kind of life expectancy there</p>
<p>for men in particular.</p>
<p>But I found women, older Russian women,</p>
<p>including, you know, Russian from St. Petersburg</p>
<p>or some of the elderly women in Kamchatka,</p>
<p>who were, you know, some were Koriak,</p>
<p>some were half Koriak, half Russian, some were Chukchi.</p>
<p>I just found them to be so enlightening</p>
<p>the way they talked about history, about people,</p>
<p>so insightful about humanity, you know,</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;ve lived through in the last 50 years</p>
<p>in some of these parts of Russia,</p>
<p>like the upheaval, societal upheaval,</p>
<p>the destruction, the building up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something I could not even imagine.</p>
<p>And I think their insights were just very,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking of anything in particular,</p>
<p>but I just remember I could listen</p>
<p>to some of these elderly women talk about their lives</p>
<p>for hours and hours.</p>
<p>I remember there was this older,</p>
<p>elderly blind Koriak woman who you would have thought</p>
<p>was the, you know, most country bumpkin of country bumpkin,</p>
<p>and yet she couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about</p>
<p>how much she loved reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,</p>
<p>which might also speak to the Soviet education system.</p>
<p>And it was just sort of surprising and fascinating,</p>
<p>and just those stories and perspectives on life</p>
<p>really stayed with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, with babushki.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wisdom, there&rsquo;s a kindness.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose that&rsquo;s true for older people in general,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about, it&rsquo;s not just Russia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Eastern Europe, it&rsquo;s like this kind of look of wisdom,</p>
<p>and not just like sort of middle class wisdom</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I have seen some shit wisdom, I&rsquo;ve seen it all.</p>
<p>And on the other side, I&rsquo;m left here with a pragmatism</p>
<p>and a compassion, and also an ability to cook really well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure, absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just this balance of just deep intelligence</p>
<p>and deep kindness, and yeah, I mean I part much of who I am</p>
<p>is because of the relationship I had with my grandmother</p>
<p>who was a Russian, Ukrainian born Russian grandmother.</p>
<p>Did you learn the Russian language?</p>
<p>I did, it&rsquo;s quite rusty at this point,</p>
<p>but I did, one of these wonderful elderly Russians</p>
<p>in St. Petersburg sort of adopted me.</p>
<p>I think that was another thing that a lot of these</p>
<p>elderly women on every side of the country</p>
<p>kind of adopted me or saw me as this real curiosity.</p>
<p>This was around 2002, 2003, it just wasn&rsquo;t common</p>
<p>for this sort of strange American to suddenly show up</p>
<p>in the middle of Kamchatka or even St. Petersburg,</p>
<p>and just absolutely ravenously curious</p>
<p>about everything they had to say.</p>
<p>So I often got adopted and one of them taught me Russian</p>
<p>and how to ride a horse, so the same babushka</p>
<p>taught me both of those things.</p>
<p>And like you said also, I should mention</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about the Soviet education system</p>
<p>where yeah, everybody reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exceptionally well read.</p>
<p>No matter where life has taken you,</p>
<p>no matter where you come from,</p>
<p>the literature, the mathematics, the sciences,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all like extremely well educated</p>
<p>and that creates a fascinating populace.</p>
<p>Like then you take that education,</p>
<p>that excellent early education,</p>
<p>and you throw a bunch of hardship at those people</p>
<p>and then they kind of cook in that hardship</p>
<p>and come out really fascinating people on the other end.</p>
<p>It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance,</p>
<p>like Russian medical science is not,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t see a lot of sort of studies,</p>
<p>medical studies, advancing of medical science</p>
<p>come out of Russia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sort of, I&rsquo;m surprised sort of,</p>
<p>I wish that it would.</p>
<p>I visited Akademgorodok outside Novosibirsk,</p>
<p>which is an entire city the Soviets created</p>
<p>just for the study of science</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s the geology building</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the biology building</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the chemistry building</p>
<p>and I just feel like Russia has this potential</p>
<p>to be a science powerhouse or even in the medical sciences</p>
<p>but I guess you just, I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why.</p>
<p>I mean, you can certainly guess as to why</p>
<p>and I see the same thing in the other,</p>
<p>in the sciences I hold the dearest sort of,</p>
<p>in computer science, in engineering fields.</p>
<p>I kind of long held this desire, by long,</p>
<p>I mean, last couple of years</p>
<p>because a bunch of people reached out to me</p>
<p>from Yandex and Moscow State to give lectures there</p>
<p>to sort of connect.</p>
<p>You know, why so little science is coming out of there?</p>
<p>Why so little that we hear about?</p>
<p>And it feels like we should be able</p>
<p>to bridge the scientific community.</p>
<p>Like science, let&rsquo;s even say,</p>
<p>even in turmoil of geopolitics, even in global conflict,</p>
<p>I feel like science should be bigger than that.</p>
<p>But why do we not hear from the scientists</p>
<p>is because of the limitations on human freedoms,</p>
<p>on scientific freedoms.</p>
<p>I feel like in China, in Russia,</p>
<p>in any regime of its sort, you should give freedom</p>
<p>to scientists to flourish and to interact with others</p>
<p>and you can only grow from that.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t suppress that.</p>
<p>The sort of Cold War ideas, we should put those aside.</p>
<p>As somebody who spent time in Russia,</p>
<p>as somebody who learned Russian,</p>
<p>do you have some thoughts that you want to say</p>
<p>about the war in Ukraine currently?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tragic, of course.</p>
<p>Seemingly pointless to watch the destruction</p>
<p>of a country in real time.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s, you know, when you read Russian history</p>
<p>and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The populace being beaten down is a big part of it,</p>
<p>you know, from the Mongolian hordes</p>
<p>through the Tsar and the Soviets and Putin.</p>
<p>I guess, you know, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>in science in particular, medical science,</p>
<p>it feels like this sort of unrealized potential.</p>
<p>You know, the culture is so beautiful,</p>
<p>the people are so smart and well educated.</p>
<p>I think the word unrealized potential</p>
<p>is kind of how I feel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to celebrate that part of the world</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s so many beautiful people,</p>
<p>so many brilliant people.</p>
<p>And I just happen to know the language</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m able to appreciate the beauty of those people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the same is true in China.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, that&rsquo;s one of the things that makes me sad</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s all these cultures that I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fully appreciate their brilliance.</p>
<p>Even Japan and places like that</p>
<p>that are sort of, there&rsquo;s channels of communication</p>
<p>wide open and there&rsquo;s a lot of interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still, not knowing the language,</p>
<p>I feel like I miss some of the culture.</p>
<p>Or Portuguese and, you know, looking at South America</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But anyway, in Russia there certainly is</p>
<p>that unrealized potential.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, so many brilliant scientists,</p>
<p>engineers came from Ukraine, from Russia.</p>
<p>And I hope they get to flourish soon.</p>
<p>And I hope we put this,</p>
<p>I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.</p>
<p>Is there something to comment about the biology</p>
<p>of war, is there echoes of the emergency room experience?</p>
<p>Have you dealt with patients</p>
<p>that have been touched by war time?</p>
<p>Definitely, war and medicine has a very intricate</p>
<p>and complex relationship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was Walt Whitman who said it,</p>
<p>though he was a nurse during the Civil War,</p>
<p>that war is the best medical school.</p>
<p>But some people have said that.</p>
<p>And even advancements in medicine come from war.</p>
<p>The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have, in some ways,</p>
<p>really revolutionized certain aspects</p>
<p>of the way we treat trauma patients</p>
<p>in the civilian world as well.</p>
<p>The importance of tourniquets,</p>
<p>the importance of transfusing whole blood</p>
<p>instead of red blood cells isolated from serum</p>
<p>and platelets, et cetera.</p>
<p>The importance of pain control in the battlefield,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Everything from ketamine injections</p>
<p>to fentanyl lollipops in the battlefield.</p>
<p>So war has really improved medicine in many ways.</p>
<p>In another way, the Department of Defense</p>
<p>spends a lot of money on medical research</p>
<p>and really pushes the envelope.</p>
<p>DARPA is one aspect of the military budget</p>
<p>that really funds these moonshot experiments</p>
<p>that are really fascinating and really push the frontiers</p>
<p>more than seemingly most kind of universities</p>
<p>doing doctors and researchers doing their research.</p>
<p>So in a way, the space program,</p>
<p>which sort of was military initially</p>
<p>then became civilian under NASA,</p>
<p>also has led to a lot of advances and understandings</p>
<p>of health on Earth and in space.</p>
<p>So the military or war in general is a huge way</p>
<p>that medicine advances,</p>
<p>not to mention the epidemics that come.</p>
<p>My grandmother was from what&rsquo;s today Moldova,</p>
<p>what was then Romania.</p>
<p>She got typhus during World War II.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s typhus outbreaks, there&rsquo;s cholera outbreaks,</p>
<p>you know, all these, even infectious disease things</p>
<p>can advance in war, which you wouldn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>You expect sort of trauma to be the sort of main problem,</p>
<p>but actually infection is a huge problem</p>
<p>throughout history and war.</p>
<p>So we can learn a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of horrific natural experiment</p>
<p>in medical care.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ve recently been reading about</p>
<p>some of the horrific medical experiments</p>
<p>performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about it another time perhaps,</p>
<p>but nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like war.</p>
<p>Just to stay on your wild journeys for a little bit longer,</p>
<p>you have a tweet about Shackleton saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a photo of Shackleton&rsquo;s medical kit</p>
<p>from his storied expedition to Antarctica in the 1910s.</p>
<p>Some perigoric for pain, some laxative.</p>
<p>Only the essentials.</p>
<p>Would you put laxative under the essentials?</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>When I worked as a ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018,</p>
<p>I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even EKG machine.</p>
<p>So if you can comment sort of on that contrast.</p>
<p>First of all, your own journey, how harsh was it?</p>
<p>How difficult was it?</p>
<p>And given that context, can you think about</p>
<p>how hard Shackleton&rsquo;s journey was?</p>
<p>I think the difference is unimaginably stark.</p>
<p>One thing I do wanna point out is that</p>
<p>the use of laxatives early in the 20th century</p>
<p>and before that, they were used for a surprising</p>
<p>number of ailments where they probably did not help at all.</p>
<p>But I think that was a holdover from sort of</p>
<p>the old theory of medicine, the humoral theory</p>
<p>where you have to balance the fluids in the body.</p>
<p>And so causing people to vomit,</p>
<p>causing them to have diarrhea or purposely taking blood</p>
<p>out of them in bloodletting was a big part.</p>
<p>And I think that crazy use of laxatives</p>
<p>was maybe a holdover from that time.</p>
<p>But that being said, they were probably not eating</p>
<p>very high fiber food on that expedition.</p>
<p>So perhaps laxatives could have been helpful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of seal, penguin and seal meat being eaten,</p>
<p>which is not super high in fiber.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t wanna discount the importance</p>
<p>of laxatives in that setting.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&rsquo;t be the essential thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of a tiny kit</p>
<p>that has only the essentials, I mean pain, yes.</p>
<p>Laxatives, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe not.</p>
<p>I think the medical kit possibilities</p>
<p>were much narrower back then.</p>
<p>This was before antibiotics,</p>
<p>before I think germ theory might&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>it was known, but there wasn&rsquo;t much to do about it.</p>
<p>So the availability of medicines,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something that exploded</p>
<p>over the course of the 20th century.</p>
<p>So what I can put in a backpack today</p>
<p>filled with modern medications, whether injectable</p>
<p>or to be taken orally is just many orders of magnitude</p>
<p>greater than what they had back then.</p>
<p>So when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers</p>
<p>who came with their own translators.</p>
<p>And as I said, I had cabinets, not just one cabinet,</p>
<p>many cabinets full of medications,</p>
<p>both injectable, some patches, some pills.</p>
<p>I was very impressed actually with what was available there.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have to use a lot of it, thankfully,</p>
<p>though I did use some of it for people.</p>
<p>And I slept and I got free room and board on the ship.</p>
<p>So every Southern summer cruise ships</p>
<p>go take people to Antarctica,</p>
<p>the Southern Atlantic islands like the Falklands</p>
<p>and other parts of the South Pacific.</p>
<p>And then in the Northern summer,</p>
<p>the same kind of cruise ship explosion happens</p>
<p>going to Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard</p>
<p>and Franz Josef Land and other parts of the North Alaska.</p>
<p>So, and every ship needs a doctor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great opportunity.</p>
<p>They want specifically ER doctors to deal with emergencies,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really working in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>And all you have is the medications there on the ship</p>
<p>and supplies and your knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very different experience</p>
<p>than working in a high tech modern hospital</p>
<p>with every bit of technology</p>
<p>and every sub specialist consultant available.</p>
<p>But I sort of liked that challenge.</p>
<p>I mean, I like going to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, it&rsquo;s exciting, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Practicing medicine in those settings is extra challenging</p>
<p>and really makes you hone some of your skills,</p>
<p>which is part of the reason that I sought them out.</p>
<p>Do you see echoes of some of that same effort?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to interact with astronauts</p>
<p>and those kinds of folks working on space missions.</p>
<p>Do you see some of those same echoes of challenging efforts</p>
<p>going out into space and maybe landing on Mars</p>
<p>and maybe beginning to build a small colony on Mars?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the healthcare that is needed</p>
<p>will be a big part of that.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re probably gonna send</p>
<p>overall quite healthy people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of medical decisions to make</p>
<p>about what should be brought, what should be expected.</p>
<p>To some extent, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of doctors say,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, I can&rsquo;t believe you work</p>
<p>in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>What do you do if someone gets a brain bleed,</p>
<p>like falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?</p>
<p>I mean, the obvious answer is they die.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re in the middle of Antarctica,</p>
<p>things kill you that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re inside a university hospital</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fully equipped to help with every problem that arises.</p>
<p>Mars takes that to a crazy extreme, obviously.</p>
<p>I know that even going to Antarctica,</p>
<p>different countries have had different strategies.</p>
<p>I believe it was Australia used to kind of just,</p>
<p>in anticipation, remove people&rsquo;s gallbladders</p>
<p>just so that it wouldn&rsquo;t get inflamed</p>
<p>because that is a very common medical emergency.</p>
<p>So they would just remove it beforehand,</p>
<p>even though it was not diseased at all,</p>
<p>just so that while they&rsquo;re stuck in Antarctica</p>
<p>over the winter, for instance, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s many other issues that can arise.</p>
<p>But so those are some decisions to make.</p>
<p>Maybe the people who go into Mars</p>
<p>should have their appendix removed,</p>
<p>their gallbladder removed.</p>
<p>Maybe they should have a cardiac cath</p>
<p>to see if they have coronary artery disease</p>
<p>just to know their chances of getting a heart attack there.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not always predictive.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s hard to predict</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna get a heart attack,</p>
<p>but maybe with all the data around today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get better at predicting.</p>
<p>But that will be a huge part.</p>
<p>You know, we can&rsquo;t have people,</p>
<p>the few pioneers in a Mars colony</p>
<p>dying of heart attacks and things like that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t anticipate stuff.</p>
<p>Would you go?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gone to some harsh conditions to be a doctor.</p>
<p>Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?</p>
<p>It would definitely be amazing, I think,</p>
<p>because I have a wife and two small children,</p>
<p>probably not in the cards for me at this point, but.</p>
<p>You humans with your human attachments.</p>
<p>Sex and death.</p>
<p>If you just put more priority on the death than the sex,</p>
<p>I think we would be better off.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would love to go to Mars.</p>
<p>And actually, you know,</p>
<p>I practice high altitude medicine in Nepal.</p>
<p>Space medicine is sort of an extension of that.</p>
<p>You know, the air is just much thinner, like nonexistent.</p>
<p>You know, as you go higher in the mountains,</p>
<p>the things that happen to human physiology</p>
<p>are very bizarre and strange</p>
<p>and still not well explained by science.</p>
<p>And in space, it&rsquo;s just like a crazy extension</p>
<p>of high altitude.</p>
<p>If I could just return to the, we didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had.</p>
<p>Just if we can high level say,</p>
<p>what is the greatest meal you&rsquo;ve ever had?</p>
<p>So your last meal, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>If one more meal, I get to murder you after this.</p>
<p>This is your last day.</p>
<p>We get to spend it together.</p>
<p>Where in the world would you go?</p>
<p>What would you eat?</p>
<p>I would say the most delicious thing is bone marrow.</p>
<p>And I would love a full meal of bone marrow</p>
<p>for my last, last dish.</p>
<p>I did on my birthday in 2002,</p>
<p>ate a kilogram and a half of crab meat in Kamchatka.</p>
<p>And that was also amazingly delicious.</p>
<p>The king crab they have there is incredible.</p>
<p>But I would go with bone marrow,</p>
<p>which is I think just one of the most delicious foods.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of this weird body part.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s basically all your stem cells,</p>
<p>not all of them, but the stem cells</p>
<p>that produce all your blood cells.</p>
<p>So they are spitting out billions of white blood cells,</p>
<p>red blood cells and platelets every day.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of fat in there as well.</p>
<p>Just one of the places the body stores fat.</p>
<p>And so you basically add heat and that&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the perfect food.</p>
<p>You add heat.</p>
<p>The fat for frying the stem cells is already there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.</p>
<p>Probably add some flavor too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the perfect food.</p>
<p>Does it matter which animal?</p>
<p>I prefer a larger animal just so there&rsquo;s more of it.</p>
<p>I actually like, well that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I actually really like sort of bone marrow</p>
<p>from like chicken bones.</p>
<p>Right, just sucking it out of the bone.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m known for leaving absolutely nothing edible</p>
<p>on the plate except bone itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other human I know that loves bone marrow</p>
<p>as much as you do and that&rsquo;s Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>So go, it&rsquo;s unnatural how much that man loves bone marrow.</p>
<p>I understand why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I love the steak part.</p>
<p>The bone marrow, you know what, let me argue with you</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know, it could be an acquired taste</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just too much, it&rsquo;s like too much</p>
<p>with too little work for it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s as if you gave me lobster meat</p>
<p>without the lobster having to clean the lobster.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;m spoiling myself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very fatty, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe I wanna work for something that tastes like that.</p>
<p>Well if you start from the whole animal,</p>
<p>you do have to work to get at it, right?</p>
<p>A lot of animals have the teeth and the jaw muscles</p>
<p>to chomp through bone, we do not.</p>
<p>So when you buy it from the store, it&rsquo;s already sawed up</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones</p>
<p>with a hatchet, just chop off the fat end</p>
<p>and start spooning it out.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;ll revisit it, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And where, where would you eat it?</p>
<p>Where and which place of the world?</p>
<p>Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to pick your family.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>So like which place in the world, rural or in the city,</p>
<p>those kinds of things, you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>to so many fascinating places.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;m, Antarctica I would say</p>
<p>is one of the most picturesque places I&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>I really did not, I didn&rsquo;t know how mountainous it was</p>
<p>and I guess I knew there&rsquo;d be ice</p>
<p>but just I didn&rsquo;t know how much ice it was.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s ice and mountains just overwhelming.</p>
<p>I just, you know, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow</p>
<p>might seem to you, sort of that feast for your eyes.</p>
<p>And just ice in general is amazing,</p>
<p>like the icebergs floating around Antarctica</p>
<p>is just astounding, like the different shapes,</p>
<p>the sizes are incredible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a, I believe it&rsquo;s a US Navy website</p>
<p>that tracks the largest icebergs</p>
<p>and you can read about each of them and how big they are</p>
<p>and just the formations you see, similar up near Greenland,</p>
<p>though I have not been to Greenland.</p>
<p>Just ice in general is just amazing.</p>
<p>So I could just look at its different forms</p>
<p>while eating bone marrow forever, until you kill me,</p>
<p>that is.</p>
<p>Yeah, and afterwards we go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s back to the death, the death and sex.</p>
<p>What is it about the ice?</p>
<p>Is it sort of the enormity of nature</p>
<p>that just reminds you that it&rsquo;s going to be there</p>
<p>before you and after?</p>
<p>And then you get to partake in the eating</p>
<p>of the thing you need for maintaining of your biological,</p>
<p>temporary biological organism?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a few things.</p>
<p>One is just the shapes that you see,</p>
<p>the wave action, just eating away at these pieces of ice.</p>
<p>You get these arches and just these shapes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like.</p>
<p>Geometry.</p>
<p>The geometry alone is amazing.</p>
<p>I studied math as an undergrad</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always appreciated geometry</p>
<p>and just the shapes alone are just look like brilliant works</p>
<p>of modernist art and just obviously no two</p>
<p>are ever the same.</p>
<p>Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color</p>
<p>that is just really startling and fascinating.</p>
<p>The same color of glaciers in various parts of the world,</p>
<p>that blue color is just really amazing.</p>
<p>And I also just love how it&rsquo;s sort of this constant shedding</p>
<p>from our Antarctic continent, from Greenland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this constant process of snow falling inland</p>
<p>and pushing the glaciers further out to sea</p>
<p>and them breaking loose.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of this constant shedding</p>
<p>and sort of, I always like thinking about</p>
<p>how the body has something similar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly shedding and renewing</p>
<p>and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did not know you were a math undergrad.</p>
<p>So that, I mean, you just keep getting more fascinating.</p>
<p>Can you maybe take a small step into that direction?</p>
<p>What do you find beautiful about mathematics?</p>
<p>Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?</p>
<p>I liked math.</p>
<p>I especially liked, so college math,</p>
<p>I did some calculus in high school.</p>
<p>When I got to college math,</p>
<p>I was amazed that there were no more numbers.</p>
<p>The digits disappeared.</p>
<p>It was just variables, concepts.</p>
<p>There was almost no more numbers at all.</p>
<p>It was like this totally abstract kind of way of thinking.</p>
<p>But that sort of reflects the natural world</p>
<p>and teaches you about the natural world,</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s sort of this perfect platonic ideal,</p>
<p>perhaps, of the natural world</p>
<p>that can still sort of help explain</p>
<p>what happens in the natural world.</p>
<p>But just these concepts are so abstract from life</p>
<p>and from the natural world.</p>
<p>I was actually getting interested in the natural world</p>
<p>at the same time when I was at NYU studying math.</p>
<p>I took a tour of Central Park that was pointing,</p>
<p>the guy, Steve Brill, was pointing out</p>
<p>these wild edible plants.</p>
<p>And I was learning to identify the first plants</p>
<p>and knowing what&rsquo;s edible, what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That was totally fascinating.</p>
<p>And sort of this kind of thing</p>
<p>that I felt like was connecting me to nature.</p>
<p>And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science,</p>
<p>or utterly abstract lessons I was getting in math class</p>
<p>where I was thinking through series.</p>
<p>As we approach infinity, what happens to these equations?</p>
<p>And concepts of like rings and abstract algebra,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it was just this dichotomy</p>
<p>that I enjoyed both aspects of.</p>
<p>Yeah, the concepts.</p>
<p>But so different, this kind of logical,</p>
<p>rigorous view of the world and the world of biology.</p>
<p>Why the big, how did that feel to take the leap</p>
<p>into the biological, the mushy mess of the human body</p>
<p>from the mathematical, which is all very clean?</p>
<p>Right, it does feel like a big step.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more connection than you think.</p>
<p>We talked about symmetry of the body earlier.</p>
<p>That is a real thing.</p>
<p>Fluid dynamics of how our various bodily fluids flow</p>
<p>and what makes them not flow as well</p>
<p>and what makes them flow better.</p>
<p>All these different aspects of science go into the body.</p>
<p>Everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh</p>
<p>to liquids of various consistencies.</p>
<p>A lot of science and math does teach you</p>
<p>about kind of how the body works, how it can work better,</p>
<p>what happens in sort of disease states.</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose there&rsquo;s a connection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also kind of a sort of computational biology</p>
<p>of this computational equivalence of each of the disciplines</p>
<p>which are becoming more and more fascinating</p>
<p>with all the work that DeepMind is doing</p>
<p>and the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>simulating different parts of the body</p>
<p>to try to gain an intuition understanding of it.</p>
<p>That to me is super fascinating,</p>
<p>but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification</p>
<p>of the way the body really does it</p>
<p>because the body is an incredibly weird complex system</p>
<p>and it finds a way.</p>
<p>The adaptability, the resilience,</p>
<p>the redundancy that&rsquo;s built in, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful and so unlike</p>
<p>the kind of computer based systems that we build,</p>
<p>at least we engineer in the software engineering world,</p>
<p>which kind of starts to make you think</p>
<p>how can we engineer computer systems in a different way</p>
<p>that make them more resilient in the real world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the robotics question.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>What does it take to build a humanoid robot</p>
<p>or robots that are as resilient as the human body?</p>
<p>How difficult do you think is that problem?</p>
<p>Having studied the human body,</p>
<p>how hard is the engineering problem of building systems</p>
<p>like that guy over there, the legged guy</p>
<p>that is as resilient as the human body</p>
<p>to the harsh conditions of the real world?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>and we definitely haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet.</p>
<p>I think we could probably learn lessons</p>
<p>from people who are trying to grow artificial organs</p>
<p>in the lab to eventually transplant into people,</p>
<p>which would solve a huge problem</p>
<p>of needing to get those organs from others</p>
<p>and the rejection of putting a foreign material</p>
<p>inside your body.</p>
<p>Your immune system tends not to like that.</p>
<p>That has advanced a lot recently.</p>
<p>I think some advances actually have been</p>
<p>where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells,</p>
<p>stem cells, stem cells.</p>
<p>We can grow whatever we want out of stem cells,</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s sort of a recognition</p>
<p>that what we call the extracellular matrix,</p>
<p>which is sort of the foundation of the body,</p>
<p>the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape</p>
<p>and keeps them where they should be,</p>
<p>that is actually crucial.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a lot of signaling that goes on.</p>
<p>Like you stick a stem cell</p>
<p>on the right extracellular matrix,</p>
<p>it will turn into the kind of cell that you want</p>
<p>and take the right shape and position</p>
<p>and start functioning.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been a huge, huge advance</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;s not just these celebrity stem cells</p>
<p>that are the answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of part in the background,</p>
<p>this sort of just like laying the foundation,</p>
<p>the system that you put these cells onto.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not there yet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely a lot happening,</p>
<p>a lot of research happening.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;ll be some advances probably soon.</p>
<p>So now on the topic of interaction</p>
<p>of computational systems with biology.</p>
<p>So if you look at a company like Neuralink</p>
<p>or the whole effort of brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a neurosurgery component there.</p>
<p>We have to connect electrical systems</p>
<p>with biological systems.</p>
<p>So just even the implanting is difficult.</p>
<p>Then the communication is difficult.</p>
<p>But what would you say from what you know about the brain,</p>
<p>what you know about the human body</p>
<p>and all the beautiful mess that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>how difficult is the effort of Neuralink?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s feasible?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s definitely feasible.</p>
<p>I think we need to probably know more than we do</p>
<p>and know how to connect it in all these ways.</p>
<p>I think some advances, for instance,</p>
<p>much less sexy, but really already impacting medical care</p>
<p>is something called deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>which is done for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and others</p>
<p>where neurosurgeons implant this device</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s electrically stimulates the part of the brain</p>
<p>that is not functioning in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite dramatic how effective it works.</p>
<p>And I remember as a med student,</p>
<p>watching a neurologist literally like turn the electricity</p>
<p>up on this handheld thing,</p>
<p>and you could see the person&rsquo;s Parkinson tremor go away</p>
<p>and you could see them start to walk</p>
<p>in a more steady fashion.</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s studies, there&rsquo;s actually studies</p>
<p>or there may be studies in the future</p>
<p>studying the same deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>for everything from eating disorders to severe,</p>
<p>like severe OCD, like paralyzing OCD,</p>
<p>not just like I wanna wash my hands three times,</p>
<p>but and so I think the potential is there,</p>
<p>but I guess connecting the brain in a microscopic way</p>
<p>in sort of a multifaceted way,</p>
<p>there needs to be sort of a million connections</p>
<p>or some very high number of connections</p>
<p>for them to work fluidly.</p>
<p>As far as I know, I&rsquo;m not an expert in the area.</p>
<p>First of all, I believe and I trust</p>
<p>in the adaptability of the biological system</p>
<p>to whatever crazy stuff you try to shove in there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to potentially reject things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also going to, if it doesn&rsquo;t reject things, adapt.</p>
<p>And if we can create computational systems that also adapt,</p>
<p>AI systems that adapt and can kinda,</p>
<p>both of them reach towards each other</p>
<p>and figure stuff out.</p>
<p>But actually our current AI systems are not very adaptable</p>
<p>to the what, like in the wild way</p>
<p>that biology is adaptable, like adaptable to anything.</p>
<p>And if we can build AI systems like that,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s some interesting things you could do,</p>
<p>but of course there&rsquo;s ethics</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s real human lives at stake.</p>
<p>And there you can&rsquo;t quite experiment.</p>
<p>You have to have things that work</p>
<p>and maybe simulation can help, but reality is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dangerous playground to play on.</p>
<p>It is messy.</p>
<p>You tweeted that quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you look back from far enough into the future,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;every doctor today will look like a total quack.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s humbling to think about.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing in the great,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s been so much progress</p>
<p>that we kinda have this confidence</p>
<p>that we figured it all out.</p>
<p>If you look at history and you read how people thought,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many moments in history</p>
<p>where people really thought that they figured it all out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s nothing else left to do</p>
<p>at every stage in history.</p>
<p>And then you realize no,</p>
<p>progress often happens like exponentially.</p>
<p>And every moment you continue to think</p>
<p>you figured it all out.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re being honest, if you&rsquo;re being humble,</p>
<p>then you realize we&rsquo;re just shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>So what do we make of this?</p>
<p>Like how should we feel that?</p>
<p>How should you feel as a doctor?</p>
<p>How should we feel as scientific explorers</p>
<p>of the human body?</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;re probably going to be wrong</p>
<p>about everything we currently know.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s a saying actually,</p>
<p>by the time you finish med school,</p>
<p>half of what you learned is wrong,</p>
<p>which is quite illustrative.</p>
<p>And becoming more true as time goes on,</p>
<p>so much medical research going on,</p>
<p>so much learning going on, it&rsquo;s really wonderful in a way.</p>
<p>But in some ways we still learn these concepts</p>
<p>from the past.</p>
<p>And I know when you take a test as a medical student,</p>
<p>sometimes you know they want you to give the old answer,</p>
<p>but you know there&rsquo;s a new answer</p>
<p>because of recent science,</p>
<p>but you know to give the old answer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now incorrect to get the question right on the test.</p>
<p>That happens actually quite a bit</p>
<p>because things change so quickly.</p>
<p>Yet, you know, when I look back at doctors</p>
<p>from centuries past, I mean, it&rsquo;s absurd</p>
<p>what they were doing to their patients.</p>
<p>I mean, for probably for most of human history,</p>
<p>they were doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re draining people of their blood.</p>
<p>That was, you know, bloodletting was a huge part</p>
<p>of medical care.</p>
<p>You know, George Washington died of a paratonsular abscess,</p>
<p>an abscess right next to the tonsil,</p>
<p>which has the great name of Quincy,</p>
<p>and they bled him to death.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, kind of adding insult to injury.</p>
<p>Doctors are a menace and do a lot of harm.</p>
<p>I mean, hopefully not intentionally.</p>
<p>You know, even medical errors are still a huge problem,</p>
<p>cause of death and morbidity.</p>
<p>So we do a lot of things that are not great,</p>
<p>but you know, our knowledge, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very imperfect at this point.</p>
<p>I do have some confidence.</p>
<p>You know, I guess perfect scientific studies</p>
<p>that try to get at the reality of the universe are essential</p>
<p>because when I think of why a certain medication works</p>
<p>for a certain condition,</p>
<p>it might make perfect sense in my head,</p>
<p>knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense, it must work.</p>
<p>I gave it to the patient, they got better,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s happened 20 times in the last year,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Like when you actually do a study,</p>
<p>it actually doesn&rsquo;t help, maybe it hurts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, I think the way we explain medications</p>
<p>working in our minds is often wrong</p>
<p>when you end up finally doing the study.</p>
<p>And some of the most interesting experiments</p>
<p>involve what we call sham surgery.</p>
<p>So for instance, people who injure their knee,</p>
<p>you know, arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon</p>
<p>goes in there with a scope, gets bits of bone out,</p>
<p>shaves down the cartilage, you know, cleans things up,</p>
<p>and it helps some people,</p>
<p>but they actually did some studies where one group of people</p>
<p>got the true arthroscopy and others just got sham surgery</p>
<p>where they put them to sleep,</p>
<p>made little cuts in the skin so they woke up with scars.</p>
<p>And then it turned out that it&rsquo;s not clear</p>
<p>arthroscopy is actually helping.</p>
<p>And the same, there was a recent huge study</p>
<p>of putting a stent in someone&rsquo;s coronary arteries</p>
<p>if they have stable chest pain,</p>
<p>not like I&rsquo;m having a heart attack,</p>
<p>you need a stent like right then,</p>
<p>but, you know, kind of chronic coronary artery disease</p>
<p>where every time I run up the stairs, I get chest pain,</p>
<p>and then when I rest, it goes away.</p>
<p>Like obviously you put a stent,</p>
<p>you increase blood flow to the heart,</p>
<p>like how could that not work?</p>
<p>But then when they did the sham catheterization,</p>
<p>it actually looks like it might not actually help</p>
<p>better than the sham.</p>
<p>So I think those placebo controlled studies are essential.</p>
<p>I mean, it is shocking,</p>
<p>and this has been driven home during the last two years,</p>
<p>how hard it is to figure out</p>
<p>what the hell&rsquo;s going on in the universe,</p>
<p>especially with our bodies.</p>
<p>Like it is really hard to get at the truth</p>
<p>and what you think makes sense, like often turns out,</p>
<p>I mean, the history of modern medicine</p>
<p>is littered with examples where it made perfect sense</p>
<p>and it seemed to help some patients,</p>
<p>and it turns out it&rsquo;s not doing anything or it&rsquo;s harmful.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s all kinds of narratives swimming around.</p>
<p>We convince ourselves as a human civilization</p>
<p>that something is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a propaganda machines, there&rsquo;s just self delusion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a centralized communities,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a scientific community</p>
<p>that believes a certain thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that believe a certain thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes the scientific community, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes the conspiracy theorists are right</p>
<p>throughout human history, I mean.</p>
<p>And we now think the scientific community,</p>
<p>well, now the science has really figured it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re way smarter than we were in the past.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s these like interesting studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen, I think Robin Hansen mentioned it to me,</p>
<p>that if you look at the entirety of medication,</p>
<p>like the effect of medication on human health,</p>
<p>if you do those kinds of broad studies,</p>
<p>does it actually help?</p>
<p>Like does quality of life,</p>
<p>lifespan, certain measures of the wellbeing,</p>
<p>does if you, and you look at human society as a whole,</p>
<p>does taking medication or not actually help?</p>
<p>And those studies find there&rsquo;s no positive</p>
<p>or negative effect with medication.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very kind of interesting perspective.</p>
<p>That mean you could probably argue a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but the point is, because you can bring up</p>
<p>literally a billion cases where medication</p>
<p>has significant positive impact on a particular patient,</p>
<p>but you have to kind of zoom out</p>
<p>and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine,</p>
<p>of lifestyle choices, diet choices, of exercise or not.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll find eventually</p>
<p>that exercise is actually bad for you.</p>
<p>Maybe like there&rsquo;s all kinds of things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to, I feel like we&rsquo;re going to figure out.</p>
<p>One of the things I think we&rsquo;re going to figure out,</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve learned about my body,</p>
<p>is that aside from it being adaptable,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of very unique parameters</p>
<p>that are opaque to me that I&rsquo;m measuring</p>
<p>through this feedback mechanism</p>
<p>by trying stuff and learning about it.</p>
<p>And one of the things we might learn</p>
<p>is that medicine cannot be done without collecting</p>
<p>a huge amount of data about each individual human.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absurd to be, like if I show up and see a doctor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absurd for that doctor</p>
<p>to have just a couple of minutes with me.</p>
<p>Like just looking at basic symptoms,</p>
<p>looking at such crappy data.</p>
<p>Like first of all, no long term data,</p>
<p>no longitudinal data, no historical data,</p>
<p>no detailed analysis of all the possible things.</p>
<p>Not just the related to your symptoms,</p>
<p>but related to other things that you&rsquo;re not complaining about.</p>
<p>Just giving you a full picture of the data</p>
<p>and then using AI to help the human doctor</p>
<p>highlight the things that you should perhaps</p>
<p>pay extra attention to.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll look back at this time as ridiculous</p>
<p>that doctors were expected to help anybody whatsoever</p>
<p>without having the data,</p>
<p>without having a huge amount of data about the human body.</p>
<p>Like you have to do so much with so little data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very 19th century.</p>
<p>So it relies on the brilliance of doctors</p>
<p>and of course the intuition,</p>
<p>the instinct you build up over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s quite powerful.</p>
<p>The human brain is pretty damn good</p>
<p>for using experience to teach you</p>
<p>how to make a good decision.</p>
<p>But still it&rsquo;s, you might as well be bloodletting.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s humbling to think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>It is humbling and it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective</p>
<p>on what they do.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because as I said, medical history is just,</p>
<p>medical dogma has been tossed into the trash bin</p>
<p>so many times.</p>
<p>Something doctors were sure of was the case is not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to be cognizant of that.</p>
<p>You tweeted about somebody that had a big impact</p>
<p>just by reading about him on my life as well.</p>
<p>Still think about him.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer.</p>
<p>A big inspiration to me.</p>
<p>His medical career was a testament</p>
<p>to what one person can do to improve the world.</p>
<p>So who was Paul Farmer?</p>
<p>And what made him a great doctor and a great man</p>
<p>and somebody who was an inspiration to you?</p>
<p>So Paul Farmer was a kind of pioneer of global health.</p>
<p>He started Partners in Health,</p>
<p>which is kind of an international health organization</p>
<p>that operates originally in Haiti,</p>
<p>also Rwanda and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And I think he was just so a zealot</p>
<p>for getting healthcare to some of the poorest people</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And I remember reading some of his books</p>
<p>and a book about him by Tracy Kidder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really great, Mountains Beyond Mountains,</p>
<p>about how even when he was a medical student,</p>
<p>he was flying back and forth to Haiti in between exams</p>
<p>and just with this really intense focus and interest</p>
<p>in getting healthcare to where it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And I think traveling around the world,</p>
<p>especially to poor places like India, Calcutta, Nepal,</p>
<p>you really see how unevenly the benefits</p>
<p>of modern medicine are spread</p>
<p>over the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Not only if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>cause if you&rsquo;re in Antarctica and have a heart attack,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in serious trouble,</p>
<p>but just medications that cost pennies a day</p>
<p>can help people.</p>
<p>A lot of children in India under five die of diarrhea</p>
<p>and all they need is oral rehydration solutions</p>
<p>to stay hydrated.</p>
<p>Most of them can&rsquo;t afford IV fluids, for instance,</p>
<p>to get admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>And really dehydration just kills hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of kids throughout the world.</p>
<p>Not to mention bacterial pneumonia also is a major cause</p>
<p>of death in children under five.</p>
<p>And many of them, not all, would be saved by amoxicillin,</p>
<p>which is just pennies.</p>
<p>And I, for me, I took a, had a path</p>
<p>and I wanted to have a career in global health.</p>
<p>And I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere</p>
<p>when I was a medical student and continued doing that.</p>
<p>Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first</p>
<p>to kind of open everyone&rsquo;s eyes, I think,</p>
<p>about the good you can do with just money</p>
<p>that we would, you know, change that we would throw away,</p>
<p>just, you know, put in a person, forget it,</p>
<p>or wherever we accumulate change these days.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very eye opening.</p>
<p>And while medical science advances and that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>you know, we shouldn&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>that 100 year old treatments could save lives</p>
<p>in parts of the world where they&rsquo;re just not available.</p>
<p>People should definitely read Mountains Beyond Mountains.</p>
<p>Just, for me at least, sort of a person from outside</p>
<p>all of it, it was the first person to make me realize</p>
<p>how difficult and the amount of humanity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in being a doctor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not some kind of cold economics based argument</p>
<p>about where to send treatments and so on.</p>
<p>That is there too, like you said,</p>
<p>basic treatments can help hundreds of thousands,</p>
<p>millions of people in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also when you have a patient in front of you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect of you that&rsquo;s willing to give</p>
<p>a lot of your time, a lot of your money,</p>
<p>a lot of your effort to saving them,</p>
<p>even though it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s irrational in some sense, but it&rsquo;s also human.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the struggle of every doctor.</p>
<p>Like when you have to choose how to allocate your time,</p>
<p>how to allocate your mental energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough choice that a doctor has to make</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a human choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some kind of cold game theoretic choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a human choice and it can be irrational</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>People are asking you for help.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what every patient interaction is.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s asking you for help.</p>
<p>So your inclination is to help them.</p>
<p>And even if it means going above and beyond,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of factors affect how compassionate</p>
<p>a doctor might be on any given day or point in their career,</p>
<p>their own stress and burnout, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s someone asking you for help</p>
<p>and so you do what you can to help them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done quite a lot of things in your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of story yet to be written.</p>
<p>But what advice would you give to young people today?</p>
<p>In high school, maybe undergrad, college,</p>
<p>starting out on that journey.</p>
<p>Maybe trying to pick majors, trying to pick jobs,</p>
<p>careers, dreams and goals they can pursue.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them to have a career</p>
<p>they can be proud of or to even have a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Well, I think having passion,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t always a voluntary thing.</p>
<p>You just have it or you don&rsquo;t perhaps.</p>
<p>But becoming passionate about something</p>
<p>and following it wherever it takes you,</p>
<p>I think is really important.</p>
<p>You know, when I finished college</p>
<p>and sort of went to Russia for the first time,</p>
<p>that was in some ways the beginning of my whole career</p>
<p>and passions in my life.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what I was going for,</p>
<p>what was gonna happen,</p>
<p>what kind of career it would turn into,</p>
<p>what kind of job would it help me get when I got back.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about any of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very fortunate I got that opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate to be able to go and see those places</p>
<p>and have my mind opened.</p>
<p>And I think that really just the fuel from that passion</p>
<p>that was created during that time</p>
<p>is still 20 years later going strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m partial to healthcare.</p>
<p>I love being a doctor.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the perfect combination</p>
<p>of kind of intellectual problem solving,</p>
<p>being a detective while also working with your hands.</p>
<p>You know, when you do procedures,</p>
<p>especially in the ER, it&rsquo;s sort of the perfect combination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And so I always loved working with my hands.</p>
<p>I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts</p>
<p>before medical school.</p>
<p>And I just love kind of problem solving,</p>
<p>getting clues, figuring out what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>following your nose, using your instincts, your knowledge,</p>
<p>and also just keen observation of the patient.</p>
<p>After seeing patient after patient, hundreds of patients,</p>
<p>maybe thousands over years, you do get this sort of</p>
<p>innate kind of sense, this gestalt</p>
<p>about what might be going on.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s not always a numbers thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, gestalt is actually a big part of medicine.</p>
<p>You know, you often in ERs or in hospitals,</p>
<p>hear a nurse or a doctor say something like,</p>
<p>this patient just doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of, you can&rsquo;t point to a number, a value,</p>
<p>a level in their blood, you know, a test,</p>
<p>but something about them.</p>
<p>And a lot of that I think has to do</p>
<p>with the color of their skin, believe it or not,</p>
<p>which can change in certain disease states.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>medicine combines this observation, the skills,</p>
<p>the knowledge, it&rsquo;s art and science, it&rsquo;s human,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s robotic, you know, algorithmic at the same time.</p>
<p>And I think it just, yeah, combines kind of</p>
<p>all my passions all in one.</p>
<p>And I would, you know, if anyone&rsquo;s going into healthcare,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d strongly encourage them to do so, but I&rsquo;m very biased.</p>
<p>So with that early passion, whatever that little flame was</p>
<p>that brought you to Russia, were you able to vocalize it</p>
<p>or was it just something like a gut</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pulled you towards some exploration</p>
<p>of the unknown or something like this?</p>
<p>I think it was a combination of things.</p>
<p>One was just going to a different place</p>
<p>that was different from where I grew up, you know.</p>
<p>The suburbs, you know, when you&rsquo;re in high school,</p>
<p>you hate them, later on they don&rsquo;t seem so bad.</p>
<p>But, you know, I just wanted to get,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very fortunate how I was raised</p>
<p>and never wanted for anything that wasn&rsquo;t rich,</p>
<p>but just to get out and see a different place,</p>
<p>a different people with a different culture</p>
<p>and history and language and literature</p>
<p>and to see different climates and geographies</p>
<p>and ecosystems, I just wanted to see something different.</p>
<p>And that, I guess that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve sought after ever since.</p>
<p>So just that was just so fascinating.</p>
<p>Like my trip to Kamchatka in 2003,</p>
<p>where I was there for four months</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t speak English for, I think,</p>
<p>two months out of it.</p>
<p>And just, I remember lying on the floor,</p>
<p>some wooden floor in a hunter&rsquo;s cabin</p>
<p>in the middle of Northern Kamchatka,</p>
<p>just being like, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>This is, I&rsquo;m just so grateful for like the experiences</p>
<p>I was having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning.</p>
<p>It was just, I was so grateful,</p>
<p>even though I was lying on this hard, uncomfortable floor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, this is so amazing.</p>
<p>And that, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever have another travel</p>
<p>as meaningful and life changing</p>
<p>as that particular trip to Kamchatka was.</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m still striving after it.</p>
<p>You never replicate that first high, but you always try.</p>
<p>So I just think that seeing something different</p>
<p>is kind of the game.</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t really a plan.</p>
<p>Cause I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently</p>
<p>and his advice is, always have a plan.</p>
<p>And it sounds like you&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t have a plan.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t need to have a plan.</p>
<p>Just listen to your gut, your passion and follow that</p>
<p>and see where that takes you.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s telling you something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I guess the plan could be specific</p>
<p>or it could be as general as I just wanna go far away</p>
<p>and see something very different, that&rsquo;s my plan.</p>
<p>And I did just one line.</p>
<p>Yeah, just followed my nose from one thing to the next,</p>
<p>just being interested, following my passion.</p>
<p>And again, very fortunate I could do that.</p>
<p>Are there places in the world you&rsquo;re kind of thinking</p>
<p>about that your life might take you at some point</p>
<p>to be a doctor there for a time,</p>
<p>to explore for a time that you haven&rsquo;t yet?</p>
<p>I have some colleagues who do kind of global health work</p>
<p>in various countries in Africa and Central and South America.</p>
<p>I would really love to go to some of those places,</p>
<p>not just for a short trip,</p>
<p>but hopefully for an extended period of time</p>
<p>with sort of the healthcare being the ticket in,</p>
<p>but then maybe even bringing my children or just,</p>
<p>I guess at this point, some of the travel I dream about</p>
<p>is sort of replicating what I did</p>
<p>and showing it to my kids in a way.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a lot I haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>and would love to see as well.</p>
<p>But I think those opportunities sort of lend themselves well</p>
<p>as a doctor with kind of the ability to go there</p>
<p>and sort of help patients,</p>
<p>but also teach medical students and residents.</p>
<p>Teaching is actually a huge part of being a doctor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s underappreciated,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually part of the fun of being a doctor</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re also a teacher.</p>
<p>Of course, the word doctor means teacher,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s come to mean something else.</p>
<p>But in some of my jobs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working alongside medical students and residents</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m giving them my knowledge, my wisdom,</p>
<p>sharing with them stories.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a very satisfying part of the job.</p>
<p>If we could take a brief step</p>
<p>into a dark place together for a time,</p>
<p>is there, what is a dark place you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind</p>
<p>in your life?</p>
<p>What would be the darkest place you ever gone</p>
<p>for a time, for a moment?</p>
<p>And how did you survive?</p>
<p>How did you overcome it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>I would say I haven&rsquo;t had as dark moments</p>
<p>as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate in that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a pretty enjoyable, satisfying life.</p>
<p>I think everybody has dark moments though, including me.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things I feel like</p>
<p>becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been,</p>
<p>one, no one knows what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And two, suicide is incredibly common,</p>
<p>like in all humans and all societies.</p>
<p>That I just find shocking.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never seriously contemplated myself,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it hasn&rsquo;t crossed my mind</p>
<p>during some more stressful times of life.</p>
<p>I think it crosses everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>And sort of as a kid, I found that I never would have guessed</p>
<p>how common suicide is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important question to sort of the Camus question,</p>
<p>like why live?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because like life, especially when you&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>especially when life is shit,</p>
<p>like why am I doing any of this?</p>
<p>And then on top of that, chemistry of your brain,</p>
<p>it could be as simple as diet and nutrition</p>
<p>and aforementioned exercise and things like this</p>
<p>that affect the chemistry such that you&rsquo;re more predisposed</p>
<p>to go to the places of asking the question why,</p>
<p>and maybe struggling to find a good answer.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s actually a question with no good answer,</p>
<p>except something in your chemistry says,</p>
<p>well, I kind of like it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no good intellectual answer.</p>
<p>And especially if day to day, it&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>You get to see these stories of Robin Williams,</p>
<p>these people that are on top of the world</p>
<p>from an external perspective,</p>
<p>but from an internal perspective, it&rsquo;s struggle.</p>
<p>Every day is pain, feels hopeless,</p>
<p>and yeah, that&rsquo;s a question we all have to struggle with</p>
<p>or learn how to ignore.</p>
<p>Maybe because if you ask the question too much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to find a good answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a choice you make.</p>
<p>I personally think you should ask that question a lot.</p>
<p>But maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not in danger of seriously contemplating suicide.</p>
<p>But why live is an important question to answer constantly</p>
<p>and struggle to answer that constantly.</p>
<p>But people, I&rsquo;ve been extremely fortunate</p>
<p>to meet people over the past couple of years</p>
<p>that are really struggling.</p>
<p>And you have probably met people</p>
<p>who are really struggling, like orders of magnitude</p>
<p>more people who are really struggling.</p>
<p>Some of it is psychological, a lot of it is biological.</p>
<p>And man, life is a motherfucker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty tough.</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>I do think also past trauma plays a big role there</p>
<p>like we talked about, war wounds and PTSD.</p>
<p>A lot of people grew up with just horrific childhoods.</p>
<p>They were abused in one way or another.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people who have not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying a majority, but a lot of people,</p>
<p>for instance, who I see in the ER coming in</p>
<p>for threatening suicide or actually trying and failing</p>
<p>and being brought to the ER,</p>
<p>a lot of them just have really traumatic experiences,</p>
<p>saw their parent commit suicide, were abused.</p>
<p>These leave scars in the human brain and mind.</p>
<p>And a lot of their subsequent lives</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;s substance abuse, alcoholism, et cetera,</p>
<p>is almost trying to escape from their own memories.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes.</p>
<p>Like sometimes people get ruined, it seems,</p>
<p>and just can&rsquo;t be fixed, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yes, you can improve diet and health and your life choices</p>
<p>and seek out your passion and exercise.</p>
<p>And those definitely will help.</p>
<p>But sometimes just like, you know,</p>
<p>you bear the scars of the past</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no getting rid of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s possible to live with them.</p>
<p>I think so too. To the struggle.</p>
<p>I would never say give up, you know.</p>
<p>Keep fighting.</p>
<p>It is a constant, it can be a constant battle</p>
<p>for some people.</p>
<p>I know it can be, and I&rsquo;ve talked to many of those folks,</p>
<p>I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight.</p>
<p>Hopelessness. Keep up the good fight.</p>
<p>Hopelessness is kind of one of the big suicide risk factors</p>
<p>that you sort of ask about as a doctor, you know,</p>
<p>do you feel hopeless? And that sort of can be a harbinger.</p>
<p>I have quite a few dark moments.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re listening and you&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in this together, brother and sister,</p>
<p>keep up the good fight.</p>
<p>Life is a motherfucker, as you said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really harder.</p>
<p>I think as a kid, you know, in a joy free childhood,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize, like, obviously there&rsquo;s a ton</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize about life,</p>
<p>but then when you get to be an adult,</p>
<p>you realize just how complex and hard it is.</p>
<p>Is it this hard for adult animals?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t seen the honesty of biology before you.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>Do you contemplate death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your own death?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely thought about it,</p>
<p>especially maybe while doing certain risky things,</p>
<p>ice climbing and others where every time I looked down,</p>
<p>I thought about my own death.</p>
<p>But I think, you know,</p>
<p>I think having kids changes the equation for sure,</p>
<p>should change the equation perhaps.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of,</p>
<p>now when I think about what will happen when I die,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of worrying about</p>
<p>what will happen to the people I care for.</p>
<p>You know, you think about things like insurance policy,</p>
<p>life insurance and, you know, disability insurance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not related to death, but more just injuries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the weight, I guess,</p>
<p>that you feel as an adult,</p>
<p>that I think grows rapidly when you have kids.</p>
<p>Though not only, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other people you can care for,</p>
<p>your own parents and loved ones.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people depend on individuals.</p>
<p>And so you think about what will happen</p>
<p>to the other people when you die.</p>
<p>But also, to push back, that weight</p>
<p>might be something you&rsquo;ve convinced yourself to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important weight to think about.</p>
<p>But you focus on that weight to escape the other weight,</p>
<p>which is, at one point,</p>
<p>this consciousness just comes to an end.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of that.</p>
<p>We kind of delude ourselves in thinking,</p>
<p>okay, it just, yeah, it ends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the natural way of things and so on.</p>
<p>That makes sense, so we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s the way of life.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s cognitively easy</p>
<p>to just realize how terrifying that is.</p>
<p>We love life so much that the end of it,</p>
<p>it just, it&rsquo;s something that makes no sense.</p>
<p>And if you linger on that thought,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a painful, I would say even terrifying thought.</p>
<p>Not scared of like, in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like philosophically terrifying.</p>
<p>Like, it just reminds you, maybe humbles you</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know anything about anything.</p>
<p>But one of the things we do as humans really well</p>
<p>is we, especially with kids, you realize,</p>
<p>okay, we start caring for others in the community,</p>
<p>in the family, and so on, and that distracts us.</p>
<p>So then we can at least focus on other people&rsquo;s problems</p>
<p>and not deal with our own.</p>
<p>When I was a medical student, I was particularly</p>
<p>fascinated with kind of what actually happens</p>
<p>as people die, like in the last minute, seconds of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of surprising sometimes,</p>
<p>like what actually kills people.</p>
<p>You know, like you can get, let&rsquo;s say, a bad head injury</p>
<p>and you know, what kills you.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just your consciousness decreases</p>
<p>and you become kind of comatose, you aspirate,</p>
<p>your oxygen plummets, and you get cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>You know, that kind of sequence of events.</p>
<p>Or, you know, a heroin overdose,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you stop breathing.</p>
<p>Similarly, your oxygen goes down,</p>
<p>then you get a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>So I was really fascinated with what actually happens,</p>
<p>what makes people die.</p>
<p>And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously,</p>
<p>like most of med school is.</p>
<p>And I had many instances where I&rsquo;ve had patients pass</p>
<p>and as a medical student, I was sort of learning</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s actually happening, watching it happen</p>
<p>and not always being able to prevent it.</p>
<p>It was sort of a scientific exploration.</p>
<p>Then the patient&rsquo;s family comes in and are just devastated.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, rips you out</p>
<p>of this scientific perspective</p>
<p>and you just realize how horrible death is,</p>
<p>but the person&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the family, I guess.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always, I guess that pointed out</p>
<p>just how what people leave behind</p>
<p>is often kind of the horribleness of death.</p>
<p>Like just becoming unconscious and staying that way</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem, I guess to me personally, so bad.</p>
<p>Sort of like going to sleep, not waking up,</p>
<p>not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.</p>
<p>So the actual pain, the actual suffering</p>
<p>is often felt by the people who love the person who died.</p>
<p>So both financial pain, psychological pain,</p>
<p>for years missing them, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Right, never forgetting the anniversary of their death.</p>
<p>You know, just having flashbacks or something reminding you.</p>
<p>That sort of brought home to me sort of what death means.</p>
<p>And it was more about what people leave behind</p>
<p>than what happens to them specifically.</p>
<p>See, I like those concerns</p>
<p>because I feel like I can do a lot about those.</p>
<p>Those make sense to me.</p>
<p>Then just be, if you&rsquo;re a father, just be a good father.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sort of, you mentioned sort of insurance.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s like financial stuff to take care of.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t know what to do with</p>
<p>is the philosophical existential crisis</p>
<p>of the fact that this fricking thing ends.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know how to deal</p>
<p>with the mystery that&rsquo;s beyond death.</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Why are we born at all?</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>And you just look at yourself.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Why do I have the capacity to suffer?</p>
<p>Why, why, all these kinds of why questions</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have answers.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.</p>
<p>The biggest ridiculous one.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Having, with this book, studied the incredible,</p>
<p>beautiful biology of life, the components,</p>
<p>the engineering components that make up this human body.</p>
<p>But when you look at the entirety of it,</p>
<p>what is why?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Sometimes, probably more often than not,</p>
<p>feel like the question of why is a trick</p>
<p>of the human brain.</p>
<p>And outside of our thoughts, there is no why.</p>
<p>Why is not something that&rsquo;s in the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this trick happening inside our brain.</p>
<p>So why is a game that the human brain plays on itself?</p>
<p>And then the reality of life doesn&rsquo;t have why&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I do wonder if asking why</p>
<p>is sort of an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>Like why, you know, maybe hunting, gathering.</p>
<p>Why does this plant grow there and not there?</p>
<p>Why do I see the same deer tracks</p>
<p>and by the same tree every three days?</p>
<p>Why, you know, why is this, why is that?</p>
<p>Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I guess those why&rsquo;s are very practical</p>
<p>and oriented towards survival.</p>
<p>But then obviously, you know, we not only use why,</p>
<p>you know, we use it to maybe hunt better,</p>
<p>gather better, survive better,</p>
<p>but then we sort of extrapolate it</p>
<p>into these unanswerable questions, you know,</p>
<p>about why, like why does life exist?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that they&rsquo;re not unanswerable</p>
<p>in the long arc of science and history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re just striving for the really difficult questions.</p>
<p>Right now, we just don&rsquo;t know much about anything</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re striving.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a long, so most of human history,</p>
<p>you were asking why questions</p>
<p>for which we now have very precise answers,</p>
<p>including with biology and physics</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And maybe the why&rsquo;s, this cutting edge of science,</p>
<p>of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind.</p>
<p>Like man&rsquo;s search for meaning</p>
<p>is the sort of the ultimate driver of the why.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation</p>
<p>of asking exceptionally hard why questions</p>
<p>that will never get answered.</p>
<p>Like, so you should always have,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like a queue, it&rsquo;s a stack of questions,</p>
<p>why questions, and that thing should never come</p>
<p>to the bottom, should always be striving.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s useful for humans to come up</p>
<p>with better and better ways of survival.</p>
<p>And maybe from in a bigger perspective</p>
<p>for the universe to figure out something about itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just humans, just a useful tool for that.</p>
<p>Or life on Earth is a useful tool for that.</p>
<p>Well, John, this, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>for people who should know, you&rsquo;re from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Philadelphia, so it&rsquo;s an honor</p>
<p>that you would travel all this way</p>
<p>from a place I love to the new place I love</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll write this really incredible book</p>
<p>that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways.</p>
<p>And thank you for everything you do,</p>
<p>for being a great educator, for being a great doctor,</p>
<p>for being a great person, and for spending</p>
<p>your really valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you, John.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jonathan Reisman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Paul Farmer,</p>
<p>a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me</p>
<p>with the way he practiced medicine</p>
<p>and the way he lived his life.</p>
<p>The idea that some lives matter less</p>
<p>is the root of all that is wrong with the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
