<p>Monday that step last Friday I lost 12</p>
<p>pounds and I&rsquo;m now at 14 pounds now but</p>
<p>the problem that I&rsquo;m having is that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been struggling with the back pulse rate</p>
<p>heart pulse rate then I&rsquo;m also getting</p>
<p>these extreme muscle like charley horses</p>
<p>in both of my legs now in my feet so I</p>
<p>should purchase your potassium energy</p>
<p>you know electrolytes and stuff like</p>
<p>that I guess my questions are you how</p>
<p>long before I guess I&rsquo;ll start kind of</p>
<p>feeling like I&rsquo;m back to normal</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken the 1006 so it appears that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much in a ketogenic diet but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the symptoms that I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to overcome a certainty the fast heart</p>
<p>rate just keeps kicking and standing up</p>
<p>I mean I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not even doing</p>
<p>anything right I feel like that what is</p>
<p>your pulse rate okay what is your pulse</p>
<p>rate I&rsquo;ve seen it up to about 130 Anna</p>
<p>resting now oh don&rsquo;t know that I told</p>
<p>Jack that is my resting that is my</p>
<p>resting time and a lot of times and now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now that a few days have gone by I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>now my resting rate is about 103 116 so</p>
<p>your resting pulse rate is between 103</p>
<p>to 116 yeah and did you ever have a high</p>
<p>pulse rate before I did not okay not not</p>
<p>to my knowledge and I I think I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not Mogwai no I&rsquo;ve never felt like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know going up a meeting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing like I&rsquo;ve worked out all day I</p>
<p>guess if that makes sense yeah okay so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about that Margaret</p>
<p>because the normal pulse rate is 70s mm</p>
<p>wake up yeah that&rsquo;s pretty high I would</p>
<p>do two things I would start down that</p>
<p>stuff like three scoops the day spread</p>
<p>out and honestly I probably would</p>
<p>communicate with my office let them know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m interested in knowing your</p>
<p>pulse rate over the next three days to</p>
<p>make sure it comes down gradually if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming down I need to give you</p>
<p>some other suggestions but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into ketosis and you are already</p>
<p>potassium deficient now the problem is</p>
<p>when you do a normal blood test most the</p>
<p>potassium is inside the cell so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just measuring the blood potassium which</p>
<p>is is not going to show up unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very very very very deficient so when</p>
<p>you switch over to fat-burning you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using new enzymes new cellular machinery</p>
<p>that require more potassium and B</p>
<p>vitamins so you probably were very</p>
<p>deficient going into this so you better</p>
<p>make sure that your your vegetables are</p>
<p>between seven to ten cups a day a</p>
<p>vegetable I would do a vacarros I would</p>
<p>also do three servings of my electrolyte</p>
<p>powder that&rsquo;ll give you another three</p>
<p>thousand milligrams of potassium it</p>
<p>should start coming down and if it does</p>
<p>great no problem keep doing it so it</p>
<p>should happen pretty quick but it takes</p>
<p>a while if you&rsquo;re that deficient it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take weeks to really replenish</p>
<p>the potassium deficiency the other thing</p>
<p>that can raise a pulse rate is B vitamin</p>
<p>deficiencies b1 so get some nutritional</p>
<p>yeast start taking that as well and that</p>
<p>way you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll go through this</p>
<p>transition pretty easy but the two main</p>
<p>minerals or nutrients that are that most</p>
<p>people need doing this keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is potassium and b1</p>
<p>and some of the other B vitamins but</p>
<p>those are the two things that I would do</p>
<p>and the fact that you&rsquo;re Charlie horses</p>
<p>are are present the electrolyte has also</p>
<p>the trace minerals calcium magnesium and</p>
<p>all these other things so I think that</p>
<p>should handle it and yes it just</p>
<p>communicated me Kim</p>
<p>Kait with my office and let them know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested over the next few days if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming down yeah so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would do</p>
<p>thanks for calling Margaret hey al</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Michigan</p>
<p>you had a question</p>
<p>hey dr. Berg thank you so much for</p>
<p>taking this phone call and I really</p>
<p>appreciate it I&rsquo;ve been a fan of your</p>
<p>channel for some time I&rsquo;m just I really</p>
<p>have a few questions I&rsquo;m hoping that you</p>
<p>can answer go I know you just important</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve got the importance of</p>
<p>getting enough potassium in your diet</p>
<p>and I agree with you but should we be</p>
<p>concerned about our sodium intake as</p>
<p>well there are some sites online that</p>
<p>mentioned getting between four to six</p>
<p>grams of it on the ketogenic diet is</p>
<p>this something you would agree with</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question al good</p>
<p>now do we have any other questions no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good now let me answer that</p>
<p>question yes people are kind of freaked</p>
<p>out about sodium when you do a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and intermittent fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to lose fluid excess fluid and</p>
<p>electrolytes not just potassium but</p>
<p>maybe even magnesium sodium so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in sodium a lot of times</p>
<p>people get headaches so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>indication or fatigue so yes you want to</p>
<p>increase your salt on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for sure and especially if you take and</p>
<p>you start feeling better now as far as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re needing four to five grams no at</p>
<p>the very most I would do maybe one and a</p>
<p>half to two grams but that&rsquo;s like a half</p>
<p>a teaspoon of salt it&rsquo;s not much maybe</p>
<p>to a fourth to a half a teaspoon of salt</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not a crazy amount but yeah we</p>
<p>increase the potassium increase your</p>
<p>sodium because we need both and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really really really good point I just</p>
<p>make sure that I you know eat salty</p>
<p>foods like I do the cheese I do the I do</p>
<p>olives things like that so absolutely</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need like 4 to 5 grams</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start retaining fluid</p>
<p>but if you take more potassium you need</p>
<p>more sodium people tend to be in a low</p>
<p>sodium diet and they what they really</p>
<p>should do is increase their potassium to</p>
<p>increase the ability to</p>
<p>hold sodium because they both work in</p>
<p>kind of opposites but you need both of</p>
<p>them so you never want to just do one</p>
<p>specific mineral that&rsquo;s why we if you</p>
<p>look at in nature vegetables tend to not</p>
<p>be high in sodium they&rsquo;re high in</p>
<p>potassium so naturally we need more so</p>
<p>we need a ratio of four-to-one four</p>
<p>times as much potassium and sodium and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s 4700 to about a thousand</p>
<p>milligrams of sodium but realize when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting salt because let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you have one unit of salt well that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re getting one minute</p>
<p>of sodium here it&rsquo;s a lower amount of</p>
<p>sodium because the sodium chloride so</p>
<p>you would want to have a little more</p>
<p>salt to get your thousand milligrams of</p>
<p>actual sodium itself all right hope that</p>
<p>helped out hey Chuck you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Atlanta you two question</p>
<p>okay dr. Burke thanks for taking our</p>
<p>call I&rsquo;m sitting here with my wife now</p>
<p>questions really is kind of twofold</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a keeper genik diet we want</p>
<p>to know if she can be given a ketosis</p>
<p>because it hasn&rsquo;t yet been a couple</p>
<p>months I have I&rsquo;ve lost my family but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not listening anything basically</p>
<p>few pounds or so her issue is she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>feral pig that excite she&rsquo;s had a total</p>
<p>third federate ectomy Lance</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no thyroid had a total</p>
<p>hysterectomy no worries or anything at</p>
<p>coming in because of pulmonary embolism</p>
<p>at one time years ago and acid reflux</p>
<p>headaches he got type thing basically we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t push it converting her teeth</p>
<p>before the TTP so we just afford to do</p>
<p>she had some blood work a solute broken</p>
<p>cookies the back wisdom check her for</p>
<p>that so you know can she get in the</p>
<p>ketosis if she has all the issues get</p>
<p>bigger where do we start</p>
<p>okay good question Chuck now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with the situation where a lot</p>
<p>of people are not just doing any plan</p>
<p>because they have weight issues they</p>
<p>have a lot of other health issues so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to deal with that I</p>
<p>really think that she would probably</p>
<p>benefit from the membership side I have</p>
<p>because I have like over 250 videos and</p>
<p>handlings of other health issues because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about getting healthy lose</p>
<p>weight not losing weight to get healthy</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s cover a couple</p>
<p>things the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>thyroid means her metabolism is going to</p>
<p>be extra slow so that means that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really going to have to practice the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting more than you would</p>
<p>so for those people I would graduate</p>
<p>them to two meals and then go to one</p>
<p>meal a day just make sure that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really healthy meal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what it&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>to get her into some serious fat burning</p>
<p>now hysterectomy of course now the</p>
<p>pressure and the stress and the is the</p>
<p>adrenal because the adrenals are the</p>
<p>backup to the ovaries so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>probably support the adrenal gland</p>
<p>because of that loss of organs I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if she retained your ovaries or not</p>
<p>maybe she did this took up the uterus</p>
<p>but still anytime you have a surgery it</p>
<p>creates more adrenal stress now the fact</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s on chromatin that is a drug</p>
<p>that tends to block vitamin K so she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have items&rsquo; in K vegetables which</p>
<p>complicates everything because now she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do the deep dark leafy greens I</p>
<p>did a video if you search it on YouTube</p>
<p>on what other additional vegetables she</p>
<p>can have like cabbage and yellow squash</p>
<p>and things like that so she can do that</p>
<p>she needs to watch that she needs to</p>
<p>consume that in high amounts but</p>
<p>unfortunately it adds another layer of</p>
<p>complexity the other thing is the acid</p>
<p>reflux that is a pH deficiency she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have enough acid it&rsquo;s a acidic</p>
<p>pH deficiency so you have to add I would</p>
<p>get the opposite of vinegar plus pills</p>
<p>and start taking three to four with each</p>
<p>meal that should correct the acid reflux</p>
<p>so those are the things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to do to make this work</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s slow right now but</p>
<p>you can still do it</p>
<p>it just takes more strategic handling of</p>
<p>other health problems thanks Chuck hey</p>
<p>Renee you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>California oh yes I their question was</p>
<p>about vitamin D and I so I found that if</p>
<p>I take anything</p>
<p>over 500 milligrams I start feeling like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a caffeine high the jittery</p>
<p>feeling okay and also it starts turning</p>
<p>into anxiety got it</p>
<p>okay do you have any gall bladder issues</p>
<p>or digestive problems were they I do</p>
<p>have a lot of digestive problems that</p>
<p>have never really I was told I had</p>
<p>gastritis but I don&rsquo;t really know that I</p>
<p>believe that but I&rsquo;ve had off and on for</p>
<p>the past 20 years a lot of digestive</p>
<p>problems you get bloating yeah okay</p>
<p>you have constipation burping</p>
<p>constipation no no no constipation okay</p>
<p>and do you have any adrenal stress oh</p>
<p>yeah okay I okay all right good question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk about that vitamin A</p>
<p>deficiencies can come from high levels</p>
<p>of cortisol because the adrenals are</p>
<p>working too hard when the adrenal gland</p>
<p>increases cortisol through the stress</p>
<p>hormone it depletes your vitamin D</p>
<p>absorption but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>that you would then take it and have</p>
<p>these reactions almost like a stimulant</p>
<p>so more than likely especially because</p>
<p>you mentioned burping that is a bile</p>
<p>deficiency because the gall bladder is</p>
<p>not releasing for some reason enough</p>
<p>bile salts so if you take vitamin D</p>
<p>which is a fat soluble vitamin you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to notice that you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>break it down effectively so it can</p>
<p>actually create maybe a stimulatory</p>
<p>effect I think the best thing that I</p>
<p>would do with you is I would take</p>
<p>something called the gall bladder</p>
<p>formula which has in it bile salts and a</p>
<p>bunch of other things to help emulsify</p>
<p>the fats better break them down take one</p>
<p>after each meal and over a period of</p>
<p>probably maybe two weeks then start</p>
<p>adding a little bit of vitamin D into it</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll start to absorb it I would</p>
<p>take vitamin D with the gall bladder</p>
<p>formula at the same time so it breaks it</p>
<p>down but that&rsquo;s what I think you&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>against and then make sure if you take</p>
<p>vitamin D you take vitamin k2 with it</p>
<p>because vitamin k2</p>
<p>works with vitamin D together so if you</p>
<p>have too much vitamin D you become</p>
<p>deficient in vitamin k2 vitamin k2 helps</p>
<p>metabolize and work with the vitamin D</p>
<p>but I think the biggest thing is the</p>
<p>digestive issues that I think if you</p>
<p>took that that would kill two birds with</p>
<p>one stone help your digestion help you</p>
<p>absorb d3 if that doesn&rsquo;t fully handle</p>
<p>it then you know you might have a</p>
<p>sensitivity to vitamin D believe it or</p>
<p>not some people are have allergic</p>
<p>reactions to vitamin D even maybe even</p>
<p>the source of the vitamin D that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting it so that&rsquo;s another thing I</p>
<p>would look at and of course sometimes it</p>
<p>could even be the capsule that the</p>
<p>vitamin D comes in I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so take a look at those things Renee but</p>
<p>thanks for calling hey listen D D you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from New York you had a question about</p>
<p>your friends heart issue oh yes thank</p>
<p>you for taking my call first of all and</p>
<p>secondly thank you for all the advice</p>
<p>and vitamins work pretty well in my</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue so I&rsquo;m in the process of</p>
<p>recovery and yeah basically what my</p>
<p>friend has he had a heart attack a minor</p>
<p>heart attack a while on an overseas life</p>
<p>from Europe to I mean from America to</p>
<p>Europe while on tour and basically then</p>
<p>after that heart failure work you know</p>
<p>minor heart attack what happened was</p>
<p>they gave him blood thinners while in</p>
<p>Europe and the net losses were certain</p>
<p>time and he&rsquo;s into holistic medicine</p>
<p>himself but you know unfortunately he</p>
<p>has both alcohol use and drug abuse past</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s off of alcohol and drugs as of now</p>
<p>and has being up you know far drugs were</p>
<p>almost 20 years and basically what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is you know I stole him before</p>
<p>he left for this current tour and he was</p>
<p>so weak I was like okay what is your</p>
<p>what is your diagnosis what did they</p>
<p>tell you and basically they told him</p>
<p>that he had reduced ejection fraction of</p>
<p>prescribed him medicine for that guitar</p>
<p>to the functions of 25% and they told</p>
<p>him oh yeah the diet should be just</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>no sugar and well that is great but</p>
<p>basically they also told to no fats such</p>
<p>as you know avoid cholesterol and all</p>
<p>the regular stuff what they say and so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious when he get back you know</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be emailing from</p>
<p>whatever whatever we&rsquo;re talking about it</p>
<p>just um where do you even start with</p>
<p>this kind of situation and you know</p>
<p>obviously I kind of can&rsquo;t assess that he</p>
<p>has a liver body type although not you</p>
<p>know not like a another like we talked</p>
<p>about the guys mosquitoes</p>
<p>but you know so I would assume there</p>
<p>would be also fatty liver but you know</p>
<p>where do you even start if you have a</p>
<p>doctor which which is describing you</p>
<p>certain medication and then I say you</p>
<p>cannot be eggs or you cannot eat any fat</p>
<p>and basically take the medication and I</p>
<p>listen to your energy in the hard</p>
<p>webinar recordings and I was kind of</p>
<p>shocked because technically I mean how</p>
<p>do you even go about this yeah what I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find out</p>
<p>yeah you know I mean yeah okay let me</p>
<p>let me cover it you do let me cover that</p>
<p>the first thing I&rsquo;d say is anything that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m advising check with your doctor</p>
<p>first I&rsquo;m not going to make any claims</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be healed or cured</p>
<p>of any medical diseases in fact</p>
<p>everything I say is basically just</p>
<p>information to do research with you and</p>
<p>your doctor that being said let me just</p>
<p>give you my opinion on on this situation</p>
<p>to improve it naturally the thing that</p>
<p>that you need to know especially with</p>
<p>heart attacks and decrease ejection with</p>
<p>the heart the hearts basically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weakened the tissue is weakened the</p>
<p>heart is like you have four different</p>
<p>problems with the heart you have the</p>
<p>muscle problem the circulation you have</p>
<p>value ler and you have an electrical</p>
<p>problem so muscle electrical lobular and</p>
<p>then vascular so you can have a heart</p>
<p>attack from a clogged artery you can</p>
<p>have a heart attack from the heart</p>
<p>muscle failing itself that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I want to talk about</p>
<p>because the heart responds to nutrition</p>
<p>faster than any organ now when you talk</p>
<p>about B vitamins you ever notice you got</p>
<p>b1 b2 b3 but then it skips to b5 like</p>
<p>what about b4</p>
<p>whereas before there&rsquo;s a bottom before</p>
<p>if you look you&rsquo;d have to research it to</p>
<p>get the data but button before is</p>
<p>specifically in research with pigeons</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to get into has</p>
<p>shown to improve the heart muscle</p>
<p>function and it&rsquo;s something that is not</p>
<p>isolated but if you were to get a</p>
<p>nutritional yeast product you would have</p>
<p>some of that in there unfortunately in</p>
<p>the beet complex that you have usually</p>
<p>comes from unrefined grains that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you have all the B&rsquo;s but then when you</p>
<p>grind the grain turn in the flour it</p>
<p>oxidizes after like six days and you</p>
<p>kind of lose the B vitamins that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they enrich wheat and then when you</p>
<p>consume refined wheat you start creating</p>
<p>B value deficiencies so originally if</p>
<p>you if you can grind your own wheat of</p>
<p>course you don&rsquo;t want to do it because</p>
<p>it has gluten and it has turns into</p>
<p>sugar but if you can grind your wheat</p>
<p>you have nice B vitamin complexes and</p>
<p>vitamin E but that being said</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is the best bet to</p>
<p>actually give some of that b4 about in</p>
<p>b4 and b1 and some of the other would be</p>
<p>vitamins that he needs that will</p>
<p>actually make the heart stronger when</p>
<p>the heart suffers from B vitamins it</p>
<p>actually works harder and it loses its</p>
<p>tone and on an x-ray</p>
<p>it actually sags and it looks like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enlarged so it&rsquo;s part of the Megillah it</p>
<p>looks like it&rsquo;s bigger so B vitamins</p>
<p>number one nutritional yeast in larger</p>
<p>quantities maybe three tablespoons a day</p>
<p>second thing is he needs a real good</p>
<p>vitamin E not synthetic is as much of</p>
<p>the complex as you can get buy them in</p>
<p>eetu increasing increase the oxygen</p>
<p>carrying capacity to the heart and more</p>
<p>than any other vitamin so it takes the</p>
<p>stress off of the heart it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a natural version of</p>
<p>TRO - you know people take that to</p>
<p>prevent heart attacks so it it will</p>
<p>really actually help oxygenate the heart</p>
<p>if you look on certain mountaintops most</p>
<p>of the high level of mountaintops where</p>
<p>you have mountain climbers that climb</p>
<p>these mountains and they go in the high</p>
<p>altitude they can actually breathe</p>
<p>better if they take vitamin E so it</p>
<p>increases the oxygen in the body and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see empty bottles of these</p>
<p>vitamin E so I&rsquo;ve heard from several</p>
<p>mountain climbers like these see all</p>
<p>these empty bottles about a minute why</p>
<p>because it increases the oxygen carrying</p>
<p>capacity so taking a really good vitamin</p>
<p>E that&rsquo;s going to actually take the</p>
<p>stress off the heart as far as</p>
<p>cholesterol goes oh my gosh I just</p>
<p>interviewed two really key people who</p>
<p>had genetic high cholesterol and they do</p>
<p>the ketogenic in a minute fasting with</p>
<p>egg yolks and they have normal</p>
<p>cholesterol now and you&rsquo;ll see those</p>
<p>being released so I mean think about it</p>
<p>the worst you can consume for high</p>
<p>cholesterol is high carbohydrates like</p>
<p>refined sugar so they said don&rsquo;t avoid</p>
<p>that but if you start cutting down your</p>
<p>cholesterol your body&rsquo;s just going to</p>
<p>make more and you&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>able to make the stress hormones adrenal</p>
<p>hormones effectively all the hormones</p>
<p>that are made from steroid need</p>
<p>cholesterol as their foundation so I</p>
<p>disagree with avoiding cholesterol I</p>
<p>think he needs that I think that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to help his heart I think he just needs</p>
<p>to go on intermittent fasting ketosis do</p>
<p>it he&rsquo;ll eat lots of vegetables the same</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve been educating everyone on</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to improve it over time</p>
<p>so if these on Akuma tin and that would</p>
<p>be unfortunate because that&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>the blood thinner that they put people</p>
<p>on that complicates things because then</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t actually heal it but he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to have to make up the damage from</p>
<p>years of alcohol abuse to get his body</p>
<p>back in a good shape but B vitamins and</p>
<p>vitamin E that&rsquo;s the two thing that the</p>
<p>nutrients that he needs to focus on all</p>
<p>right all right so then we have a</p>
<p>Rosalyn you&rsquo;re from Florida go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air oh good morning dr.</p>
<p>Burke I have a question for you yeah</p>
<p>and I thank you for your massage tool</p>
<p>your adrenal pack and your wheatgrass in</p>
<p>the wonderful video so thank you for</p>
<p>sharing knowledge I so appreciate it I</p>
<p>have a question for you I have a</p>
<p>condition called pigment Airy dispersive</p>
<p>syndrome and with the eyes and recently</p>
<p>it has caused elevated IOP and i</p>
<p>recently had the procedure the SLT</p>
<p>procedure on both eyes and it did allow</p>
<p>it somewhat but it&rsquo;s not lowering it</p>
<p>enough where they&rsquo;re comfortable and</p>
<p>they have me using what kind of post</p>
<p>drops and just wanted to know is there</p>
<p>any natural path or naturally lowing</p>
<p>lowing the IOP in the eyes yeah good</p>
<p>question let&rsquo;s talk about that get a</p>
<p>piece of paper and a pen and write this</p>
<p>down for this this problem I would</p>
<p>recommend going getting a standard</p>
<p>process product there&rsquo;s two products</p>
<p>from standard process the company you</p>
<p>probably get online or find a health</p>
<p>care practitioner call the company find</p>
<p>out there&rsquo;s a local health care</p>
<p>practitioner in your area that carries</p>
<p>these two products but here&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>two things one there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>AC carbamide which is good for the</p>
<p>pressure good for glaucoma good for</p>
<p>increase decreasing pressure in the eye</p>
<p>it has a natural form of urea which is a</p>
<p>real soluble substance that helps</p>
<p>decrease certain edema and pressure</p>
<p>specifically through the eye and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in there it&rsquo;s hard to find</p>
<p>another product with that a lot of times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find it in facial creams and</p>
<p>things to hydrate the skin but in this</p>
<p>product it&rsquo;s called AC carbamide okay</p>
<p>get that product that will actually I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to help lower the</p>
<p>pressure in the eyes it&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>number two there&rsquo;s another dynamite</p>
<p>product it&rsquo;s called ocular trophy PMG</p>
<p>ocular troph in PMG okay that product is</p>
<p>amazing it&rsquo;s great to repair the eye of</p>
<p>damage I&rsquo;ll give an example like let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you had surgery on the eye boom you</p>
<p>need that</p>
<p>it works like within like 30 seconds</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fast or you or like me um</p>
<p>years ago when my daughter was younger</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting on the couch and she had</p>
<p>an envelope and I&rsquo;m sitting there and</p>
<p>somehow she you know brought the</p>
<p>envelope up and I turned and the sharp</p>
<p>edge of the envelope sliced my eye</p>
<p>cornea and ever since then I mean like</p>
<p>it was so much pain and in it I&rsquo;d go to</p>
<p>the eye doctor and they would heal but</p>
<p>then the chunk would pop out and they</p>
<p>were going to put little holes in there</p>
<p>so there was a lot of damage with my eye</p>
<p>and I had dry eyes at the time and so I</p>
<p>had trauma out of the eye nothing was</p>
<p>going to fix that thing and like I kept</p>
<p>trying different things so then when</p>
<p>they took ocular tropen PMG it kind of</p>
<p>gave the eye all the repair reparative</p>
<p>materials that I needed I mean it was</p>
<p>instant I felt instantly better so if</p>
<p>you had a history of damage to the eye</p>
<p>research of the eye take that one and I</p>
<p>would probably take three a day spread</p>
<p>out I think you&rsquo;re going to notice a lot</p>
<p>of improvement especially if you had</p>
<p>retinal damage or some type of past</p>
<p>trauma and it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not healing boom</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>ocular trophy and PMG and AC carbamide</p>
<p>okay hey Laura you&rsquo;re from East Texas</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re to question authority and fasting</p>
<p>oh yeah hello hi hello thanks for taking</p>
<p>my call um yes basically I have a flow</p>
<p>tyroid and I didn&rsquo;t know about it till</p>
<p>probably about last January and I am</p>
<p>taking the bystander process the</p>
<p>thyrotropin I know you&rsquo;ve mentioned that</p>
<p>in one of your videos before I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>that and I have adrenal issues but I</p>
<p>lose weight really really really slow</p>
<p>like in the last two minutes and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing keto for like a long time now</p>
<p>in the last two months I think only lost</p>
<p>like three pounds but I think a lot of</p>
<p>my issue is stressed because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>constantly worried about I&rsquo;ve got to get</p>
<p>back any of these clothes without fit</p>
<p>back into these clothes you know</p>
<p>why why am I getting away so easily and</p>
<p>then I started incorporating</p>
<p>intermittent fasting but my question is</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s so slow should I just do the</p>
<p>1 mil a day cuz right now I&rsquo;m down to 2</p>
<p>mils within like a five-hour window so</p>
<p>oh oh also it&rsquo;s a fasting and of itself</p>
<p>is that going to help me with spiralling</p>
<p>down the road is that going to help</p>
<p>repair it and on our taking that</p>
<p>thyrotropin is that going to do more</p>
<p>harm than good in the long run because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be taking that the rest of</p>
<p>my life so a couple questions number one</p>
<p>do you crave any sweets and not really</p>
<p>not anymore good are you less hungry</p>
<p>yeah pretty much</p>
<p>okay is your energy higher um</p>
<p>energy yeah actually it seems to be okay</p>
<p>do you have a history of gallbladder</p>
<p>issues at all um not that I know of but</p>
<p>one thing when I used to eat like a ton</p>
<p>of nuts or nut butter seemed like I put</p>
<p>on more white when I ate that okay and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite a lot of it got it last</p>
<p>question do you have a history of heavy</p>
<p>periods um no actually not for a period</p>
<p>of three years I didn&rsquo;t have one because</p>
<p>of birth control and got off of that and</p>
<p>so right now it&rsquo;s just been kind of</p>
<p>normal it&rsquo;s been lighter than usual I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>35 so I don&rsquo;t know if that has anything</p>
<p>to do with it was there anything that</p>
<p>occurred just before you got a Thorat</p>
<p>issue um well yeah I was like super</p>
<p>stressed because I was obsessed with my</p>
<p>weight so that maybe I don&rsquo;t know okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just give you some things</p>
<p>pointers or a couple things there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually thyroid issues are secondary to</p>
<p>some other thing either gallbladder or</p>
<p>birth control pills that will lower the</p>
<p>thyroid if you&rsquo;re still taking birth</p>
<p>control pills are you still taking birth</p>
<p>control pills no that&rsquo;s been about five</p>
<p>years ago now I got off of her okay</p>
<p>Thermage open honestly you see some</p>
<p>results I don&rsquo;t see a lot of results</p>
<p>with that it&rsquo;s not bad as a supplement</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like treating the symptom it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>getting to the root cause that&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>opinion some people disagree but usually</p>
<p>thyroid is a bile issue liver problem or</p>
<p>high estrogen which doesn&rsquo;t sound like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your issue or high cortisol</p>
<p>stress but I don&rsquo;t know because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really see you and I don&rsquo;t know all the</p>
<p>history but what I do know is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing sounds like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>better with this</p>
<p>Paquito and everything but if you do</p>
<p>keto without an immanent fasting you may</p>
<p>not handle the high levels of insulin</p>
<p>and that most people have so in a minute</p>
<p>fasting is the key to making the insulin</p>
<p>dysfunction work improve so yes I would</p>
<p>graduate to one meal a day because it</p>
<p>sounds like your metabolism is ultra</p>
<p>slow so the key to protect the thyroid</p>
<p>is make sure you don&rsquo;t cut your calories</p>
<p>and what does that mean it means that</p>
<p>you just want to eat a really</p>
<p>nutrient-dense healthy meal if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing one one meal a day you better make</p>
<p>sure that meal is super healthy lots of</p>
<p>greens and you&rsquo;re not going to be able</p>
<p>to get by with just three ounces of</p>
<p>protein in a small salad you have to</p>
<p>have a massive salad healthy fats and of</p>
<p>course probably you&rsquo;re sensitive to nuts</p>
<p>make sure those vegetables are not</p>
<p>bloating you so you might not want to</p>
<p>switch it around and make sure you have</p>
<p>a good amount of protein you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>need like something like 8 ounces of</p>
<p>protein with that meal and then maybe so</p>
<p>get some digestive help and that is the</p>
<p>trick about doing one meal a day is that</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to get all your</p>
<p>nutrients you have to really eat a lot</p>
<p>and you might get a little bloating but</p>
<p>you just want to make sure you don&rsquo;t cut</p>
<p>your calories and that should be fine</p>
<p>with the thyroid and then now because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting improvements in your</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find overtime as the</p>
<p>health improves like you your energy is</p>
<p>better less craving less hunger it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start working more and more and more</p>
<p>over time because it&rsquo;s sometimes it</p>
<p>takes months to fix insulin resistance</p>
<p>and some people need that one meal a day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do with you and the</p>
<p>fact that it&rsquo;s slow means you must have</p>
<p>had a really messed-up metabolism or</p>
<p>hormones at one time and you&rsquo;re still in</p>
<p>the process of healing that so I would</p>
<p>also not measure your weight every day I</p>
<p>would do it every two weeks and just</p>
<p>forget about it put your attention on</p>
<p>something else because as soon as you</p>
<p>start worrying and thinking</p>
<p>there goes cortisol that&rsquo;s going to slow</p>
<p>your weight down right there by being</p>
<p>concerned about it so get yourself</p>
<p>really busy to focus on other things</p>
<p>right now but just stick with the one</p>
<p>meal a day</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s probably add some of the</p>
<p>supplements I recommend like the the</p>
<p>insulin and glucose support which will</p>
<p>speed up the process of helping support</p>
<p>dysfunction with insulin so that will</p>
<p>speed you up it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t actually cause weight to come</p>
<p>off but it actually helps the the root</p>
<p>issue to speed up the metabolism so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing I think that would help</p>
<p>you but other than that give it more</p>
<p>time to one meal a day and I and you</p>
<p>will eventually lose the weight I had</p>
<p>one gal just real quick she had the same</p>
<p>situation but she didn&rsquo;t even lose</p>
<p>anything for uh four months but somehow</p>
<p>she stuck with it she comes in a couple</p>
<p>years later it was in the winter time</p>
<p>and she just gave my office and she took</p>
<p>off her jacket I was like what the heck</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t recognize her she had like her</p>
<p>body was perfect she lost all this</p>
<p>weight it just took more time than other</p>
<p>people but when she lost she really was</p>
<p>happy with that and resolved but it took</p>
<p>a little longer unfortunately but just</p>
<p>the estimation of effort is sometimes</p>
<p>people see their husband lose weight and</p>
<p>then ulsan they&rsquo;re like why can&rsquo;t I do</p>
<p>the same thing so they get frustrated</p>
<p>and give up but it just especially if</p>
<p>you get into your late 30s and 40s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a little bit more okay hey</p>
<p>Kelly you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Kentucky hi dr. berry how are you doing</p>
<p>good how are you I&rsquo;m doing fine thank</p>
<p>you um I have two questions okay</p>
<p>basically I am a CNA and I work second</p>
<p>shift 2:30 or 10:30 and I don&rsquo;t normally</p>
<p>eat until around by 1:00 because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically when I&rsquo;m hungry I workout in</p>
<p>the morning time Orly</p>
<p>maybe thirty minutes to an hour um I</p>
<p>also an orange better mean doctor may</p>
<p>try to help yesterday me to help me lose</p>
<p>weight as well but my question is by me</p>
<p>working the 2:30 to 10:30 in me actually</p>
<p>eating my first meal maybe I&rsquo;ll say 1:30</p>
<p>they Jewish um my dinner time schedule</p>
<p>wise will be like 8:00 7:30 8 o&rsquo;clock at</p>
<p>night and I try not to eat that late but</p>
<p>I know I need to least eat at least</p>
<p>twice in one day or at least one good</p>
<p>meal because normally when I eat at one</p>
<p>two maybe two o&rsquo;clock is something real</p>
<p>quick it&rsquo;s not something you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all solid I should say it may be like a</p>
<p>salad or something just something just</p>
<p>put in my stomach because I know I need</p>
<p>to eat something um what would you</p>
<p>recommend for someone that has it at</p>
<p>schedule yeah so the key thing with the</p>
<p>third shift you said the second shift</p>
<p>not the third shift right yes - very</p>
<p>dirty the key with that is not to do</p>
<p>rotational shifts because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to just destroy everything</p>
<p>people that have rotate sometimes second</p>
<p>shift sometimes third or they might do</p>
<p>it then the weekends they go back to</p>
<p>their same shift it&rsquo;s really a situation</p>
<p>on the metabolism because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating confusion so if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do second shift</p>
<p>unfortunately I would recommend</p>
<p>maintaining that even days that you have</p>
<p>off if at all possible and keeping your</p>
<p>diet consistent so you&rsquo;re not freaking</p>
<p>everything out and even if it&rsquo;s a third</p>
<p>shift keep it consistent so I think you</p>
<p>need to focus on the quality of your</p>
<p>foods to make sure that you have the</p>
<p>vegetable and the protein and the fat</p>
<p>with each of your meals now I have</p>
<p>videos on the percentages you can get</p>
<p>all that data but I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you need to do between you and me and</p>
<p>the four walls personally I would not</p>
<p>recommend the fence I mean I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you why the</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to speed up your</p>
<p>metabolism but what you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually burning it out at the</p>
<p>same time your metabolism doesn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be stimulated it&rsquo;s over stimulated</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what this does it actually</p>
<p>will increase the adrenal issues and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only designed to do a short-term</p>
<p>thing so a lot of people who take at the</p>
<p>end up slowing the metabolism down the</p>
<p>road your metabolism is a end result of</p>
<p>good insulin so once you fix the insulin</p>
<p>your metabolism will go up without</p>
<p>trying to artificially boost it so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just my opinion and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to it might do a little short-term</p>
<p>thing but then end up destroying things</p>
<p>in the end so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend but that&rsquo;s pretty much it I</p>
<p>hope that gave you some tips there</p>
<p>alright good so now Ken if you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air you&rsquo;re from Atlanta hey how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>going thank you I get my call sure good</p>
<p>yeah I just I started like a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet I guess about two weeks ago maybe I</p>
<p>need too much protein because I just did</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;m type two diabetic I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>my gallbladder removed but lately my</p>
<p>numbers have been pretty good as far as</p>
<p>my blood sugar levels go I you know the</p>
<p>dog has got me on Jen you met what was</p>
<p>dead and what&rsquo;s in a pearl and I was</p>
<p>just wondering because I look at my</p>
<p>numbers and everything from the six</p>
<p>point seven to seven point zero and a</p>
<p>one C I was wondering how long it takes</p>
<p>for that number to come down and I also</p>
<p>noticed that my LDL went up to like 134</p>
<p>and should I be concerned about that was</p>
<p>that before or after you started this</p>
<p>program I started like about two weeks</p>
<p>ago maybe being on the candida diet</p>
<p>because I noticed that my numbers were</p>
<p>not looking good oh so basically the ldr</p>
<p>that you found the LDLs were high before</p>
<p>you even started um no they were</p>
<p>actually in the normal</p>
<p>last time I had my blood work then but</p>
<p>this time they&rsquo;re higher when did you</p>
<p>have the test um like three days ago</p>
<p>okay okay um all right good question I</p>
<p>know I know I panicked like yeah I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect it to be overnight</p>
<p>hey these are really good questions um</p>
<p>now the question I have for you are you</p>
<p>doing keto and in a minute asking or</p>
<p>just keto uh I&rsquo;m trying to be</p>
<p>intermittent passing as well okay I</p>
<p>probably lost already a good you know</p>
<p>five to six pounds at least since I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started okay good all right so Kenneth</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about that definitely start</p>
<p>watching the videos that I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>releasing in the next week yesterday I</p>
<p>just did six interviews with people and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to hear this</p>
<p>because some of these guys were we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>diabetics and then you&rsquo;ll see what their</p>
<p>cycle is because if the LDL goes up and</p>
<p>sometimes it does on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting is because your</p>
<p>fat cells are shrinking a lot of that</p>
<p>cholesterol in the fat cell has to come</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s not burned as fat so it has to</p>
<p>go through the liver and the gallbladder</p>
<p>so it goes up that&rsquo;s not a bad thing</p>
<p>that needs to come out as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having enough vegetables to keep it</p>
<p>flushed that is not going to be a</p>
<p>problem because it&rsquo;s going to venture</p>
<p>come down even in some people with</p>
<p>genetic high cholesterol which don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take my word you can listen to these</p>
<p>these people that are going to tell you</p>
<p>and their personal experience which is</p>
<p>quite shocking they even actually found</p>
<p>doctors that were Pro keto and then says</p>
<p>hey just give it more time and a</p>
<p>disadvantage Lee came down now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standard cholesterol tests they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>measure both types of LDL there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>types one is a so-called bad one is good</p>
<p>one is kind of fluffy and big that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just going through the RT the other one</p>
<p>is small dense and sticky that tends to</p>
<p>be involved in the reaction so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know which one it is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the bigger one so the key is</p>
<p>looking at your triglycerides if your</p>
<p>triglycerides are coming down and the</p>
<p>HDL is normal or high then you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about if the LDL</p>
<p>is high watch my video on that too for</p>
<p>more explanations now that the a1c is an</p>
<p>average</p>
<p>insulin over a period of three months so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just looking at average so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to start coming down but you only</p>
<p>do it for two weeks you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to wait a few months but you can see</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to come down down down down</p>
<p>down especially if you follow the Kido</p>
<p>and in a me fascin like I show people do</p>
<p>it gradually make sure it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do with low quality materials or</p>
<p>foods so I think you just need to give</p>
<p>it more time and then as you get better</p>
<p>the need for statins the need for the</p>
<p>medication will go down and definitely</p>
<p>get your doctor to reduce that if not</p>
<p>take you off that stuff because the</p>
<p>statins are going to interfere with your</p>
<p>your production of cholesterol that can</p>
<p>throw things off as well we want that</p>
<p>cholesterol to be normal but again the</p>
<p>best thing is to get educated on it</p>
<p>learn for yourself because if you&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working with a doctor that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand keto they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to really want to take you off of</p>
<p>it so that&rsquo;s the big problem so you have</p>
<p>to find someone that&rsquo;s willing to work</p>
<p>with you because the goal is not to keep</p>
<p>you on medication the rest of your life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the goal someone says that</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s one doctor says well I</p>
<p>think everyone should be on statins it</p>
<p>should be in our water supply well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane so I disagree</p>
<p>all right thanks Ken hey Christine</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Florida</p>
<p>yes thank you um thank you for take Hill</p>
<p>Oh No yes okay all right thank you for</p>
<p>taking the cold after bear I am very</p>
<p>pleased and write thankful for all your</p>
<p>videos and information you gave us so</p>
<p>generously thank you very much um I just</p>
<p>started oh like about a month ago taking</p>
<p>the I have been say healthy most of my</p>
<p>life thank God ah</p>
<p>and I thought that was really healthy</p>
<p>until I started watching your videos and</p>
<p>there were problems but I am but I wish</p>
<p>I was having</p>
<p>especially my nails were very frail I</p>
<p>have these ridges and they just broke</p>
<p>easily it was terrible and I never wore</p>
<p>any false nails or anything like that I</p>
<p>try to keep my nails but it was really</p>
<p>terrible for me until like about a month</p>
<p>ago I started taking the apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar and about 3 days later it was</p>
<p>just so amazing and my nails just became</p>
<p>so hard and strong that I can do</p>
<p>anything I have been doing everything I</p>
<p>can and I haven&rsquo;t broken a nail on both</p>
<p>of em one and that&rsquo;s just amazing</p>
<p>incredible and my question is well I</p>
<p>have other problems you know like my</p>
<p>hair falling and this thing just cost me</p>
<p>to wonder so I know I have been looking</p>
<p>and fall trying to follow the u.s. ice</p>
<p>regarding the diet and vitamins and all</p>
<p>those things but still I am so amazed</p>
<p>and why why my nails became so strong in</p>
<p>such a short time and still you know I</p>
<p>know that I have tuition so maybe more</p>
<p>to get all the problems I corrected but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so amazed about it that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>first question and the second one is</p>
<p>they live in my eyes I am I I don&rsquo;t wear</p>
<p>glasses because one of my eyes with was</p>
<p>one eye I can see far away with the</p>
<p>other one I can see close so it kind of</p>
<p>compensate but I notice also that after</p>
<p>I started with this eye beside of</p>
<p>vinegared I have been doing it</p>
<p>faithfully for a month only also I</p>
<p>became like a little cloudy at the</p>
<p>beginning and I was noticing there were</p>
<p>certain problems he have any he has been</p>
<p>improving I noticed too but as I said in</p>
<p>lower-right okay so those are my</p>
<p>questions thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>okay so the first thing the reason why</p>
<p>the upside of vinegar works is because</p>
<p>if the stomach pH is not acid enough</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to break down protein</p>
<p>the purpose of the hydrochloric acid the</p>
<p>stomach is to break down protein which</p>
<p>guess what your nails are made of in the</p>
<p>hair protein and absorb minerals</p>
<p>specific specifically you know well both</p>
<p>regular minerals and trace minerals both</p>
<p>of those are needed to to metabolize the</p>
<p>proteins so with people with nail hair</p>
<p>skin issues a lot of times you just need</p>
<p>to acidify the stomach damn everything</p>
<p>improves sometimes you need to add the</p>
<p>trace minerals I use a liquid plant base</p>
<p>which because our 15,000 times smaller</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re easier to absorb and then</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be fine as far as the hair</p>
<p>goes if your hair doesn&rsquo;t improve that</p>
<p>means that it&rsquo;s going beyond just a lack</p>
<p>of protein because the hair you have to</p>
<p>feed it so one of the things I have a</p>
<p>hair formula that has all the nutrients</p>
<p>into the B vitamins the silica that has</p>
<p>stinging nettle root if there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>autoimmune alopecia so it has it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>comprehensive to handle different</p>
<p>scenarios that might be an option for</p>
<p>you but I think the cloudiness and I is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s improving so I&rsquo;m not going to say</p>
<p>stop it because and in the transition of</p>
<p>absorbing protein and by the way the eye</p>
<p>needs to have amino acids to actually</p>
<p>replenish it I would just keep doing</p>
<p>that until you get a lot better</p>
<p>improvement because this is a recent</p>
<p>change I have a video on the eyes that I</p>
<p>think you should watch especially if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one that is different than the</p>
<p>other eye and it&rsquo;s simply an exercise to</p>
<p>get the certain muscle in the eye more</p>
<p>tone less atrophied to allow you to</p>
<p>accommodate for distance or near vision</p>
<p>and you can do this exercise it really</p>
<p>does work but everyone&rsquo;s like sit in</p>
<p>front of the computer all day and you</p>
<p>actually cause that muscle to atrophy</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go outside your neck looking</p>
<p>way far away so and you would probably</p>
<p>ought to deal with one eye versus the</p>
<p>other and probably the reason why that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one eye is a</p>
<p>could have been some damage to one eye</p>
<p>versus the other eye and then now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the weak link so those are some quick</p>
<p>things that I would recommend thanks for</p>
<p>calling hey Artie you&rsquo;re on the area</p>
<p>from Maryland</p>
<p>yes I am hi how are you so much for</p>
<p>taking the call I&rsquo;m actually just</p>
<p>recently got into your videos but I</p>
<p>started to you about three months ago I</p>
<p>think I discovered your videos I would</p>
<p>say about four to six weeks ago and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been so helpful so I do</p>
<p>appreciate that um I do want to let you</p>
<p>know sort of what I do not have any type</p>
<p>of health issues I was just trying to</p>
<p>lose some weight just trying to be and</p>
<p>but I just had two stubborn weight that</p>
<p>just wasn&rsquo;t coming off you and I was</p>
<p>trying to do it the little car blah blah</p>
<p>blah blah so sure tequila in March I</p>
<p>lost about 12 pounds and just to give</p>
<p>you an idea I started at 156 and now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at 144 my BMI is about 30% and I started</p>
<p>incorporating instruments last thing I</p>
<p>would say about four weeks ago where I</p>
<p>do 16 17 hours of fasting and while I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fast nailed to the apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>in the water and I did a black coffee</p>
<p>and I started incorporating hit</p>
<p>exercises and lifting weights and I have</p>
<p>completely reduced my dairy my cheese</p>
<p>intake and I&rsquo;ve increased the vegetables</p>
<p>I think I was I wasn&rsquo;t in taking of any</p>
<p>vegetables until I started watching your</p>
<p>videos when you kind of it seemed like</p>
<p>you know those are I feel like I can</p>
<p>definitely have unlimited on the</p>
<p>vegetable so I&rsquo;ve definitely increased</p>
<p>my vegetables but I am at a standstill</p>
<p>I am stuck at 144 and I shouldn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>be looking at the scale but if it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard not trying even I went to the gym</p>
<p>and I when they told me my BMI still</p>
<p>kind of 30% I was thinking that with all</p>
<p>the weight that I lost I&rsquo;d kind of be a</p>
<p>little bit lower so I&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>see how can I shake this Plateau</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the hit and I&rsquo;m lifting</p>
<p>weights I&rsquo;m doing the Internet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating apple cider vinegar maybe</p>
<p>the things I&rsquo;ve never even thought I</p>
<p>would be able to consume the black</p>
<p>coffee</p>
<p>never well it&rsquo;s also anything well thank</p>
<p>you let me ask you a question are your</p>
<p>cravings gone absolutely okay are you</p>
<p>less hungry yes good how was your energy</p>
<p>level my energy is great when I I mean</p>
<p>usually before I would go to the gym</p>
<p>at night I&rsquo;d come back home eating</p>
<p>peanut butter because I would think I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need that protein no I don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>any of that anymore I stopped eating at</p>
<p>I would say 6:30 go to the gym with my</p>
<p>husband at 8:30</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine until the next day 11:30 12:00</p>
<p>all I need where do you hold the access</p>
<p>point even and even even even when I eat</p>
<p>a sub Safari even when I need I try I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really trying to do just to mongus big</p>
<p>meals so I&rsquo;m not snacking in between so</p>
<p>I so I really I really showed a lot of</p>
<p>discipline and so when you&rsquo;re throwing</p>
<p>so much discipline I&rsquo;m not doing the</p>
<p>weight change right I&rsquo;m kind of getting</p>
<p>discouraged okay oh my god</p>
<p>so how where do you hold the excess</p>
<p>weight a thighs so a mile or half of the</p>
<p>body oh yeah my top half yes nice and</p>
<p>slim but lower half is where I hold all</p>
<p>this have you noticed that your stomach</p>
<p>has gone down oh absolutely</p>
<p>yeah do you have any excess weight in</p>
<p>your stomach now absolutely yeah yeah</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>did you happen to see my recent video on</p>
<p>I mean I</p>
<p>sorry Artie you&rsquo;re breaking up but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to answer the question</p>
<p>because uh breaking up and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite hear it so but I think I got the</p>
<p>whole gist of it I just recently</p>
<p>released a video on where you would lose</p>
<p>weight first and second and third</p>
<p>unfortunately and this is what really</p>
<p>pisses women off is they don&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>weight in the lower part first where</p>
<p>they want it other than the stomach they</p>
<p>want that off too but the body tends to</p>
<p>will get rid of the visceral fat first</p>
<p>okay and the gut before the lower part</p>
<p>of the body the lower part of the body</p>
<p>especially the thighs</p>
<p>especially for getting into your 40s or</p>
<p>50s that that&rsquo;s more that could be more</p>
<p>estrogen weight atrophy which is</p>
<p>cellulite and not necessarily all just</p>
<p>fat so I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training I think</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>going to work overtime so let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you have a combination of like</p>
<p>loss of muscle tone loss of muscle tone</p>
<p>and and you&rsquo;re also having maybe some</p>
<p>fat but it&rsquo;s not all fat your body will</p>
<p>go after visceral fat deep into the</p>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s first and not go after the</p>
<p>lower part of the extremity you may find</p>
<p>that you hit a plateau so what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to do is probably bite a</p>
<p>personal trainer that can help you with</p>
<p>this but not just do the high interval</p>
<p>training but do some toning and some</p>
<p>compound resistant exercise to make sure</p>
<p>you focus on lower extremity and start</p>
<p>working on that over a period of time to</p>
<p>actually replenish the the muscle</p>
<p>density and the tone of that because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just weight it sounds like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any other health issues so I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what you need to do I think</p>
<p>the things that you can improve is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing sixteen to seventeen hour I</p>
<p>would go to a twenty hour fast go to</p>
<p>that and maybe even even a little bit</p>
<p>more than that as your next step and</p>
<p>then give it more time but I think you</p>
<p>should watch the video on the celluloid</p>
<p>video and improve that okay but let me</p>
<p>just go to the board here and just show</p>
<p>you what I&rsquo;m talking about just because</p>
<p>some people have a question on that all</p>
<p>right so if we take a look at the</p>
<p>transition the different steps that you</p>
<p>would do you have three meals breakfast</p>
<p>lunch and dinner and step one is to</p>
<p>avoid the snacking so step one is no</p>
<p>more snacking and you&rsquo;ve done that so</p>
<p>now we have so in other words doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting no meals late at</p>
<p>night no mid-afternoon snack and just</p>
<p>doing three meals a day</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s step one and then step two</p>
<p>is to start to wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and push this breakfast longer so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>which will happen maybe after three days</p>
<p>to two weeks you obviously you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry in the morning and you go more</p>
<p>and more let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s like eight</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock you go 9 o&rsquo;clock 10 o&rsquo;clock 11</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock and you start pushing the time</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t eat so you have a late</p>
<p>breakfast maybe it&rsquo;s like 11 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>right here or even 12 and you have your</p>
<p>breakfast or you can have your your</p>
<p>lunch and just skip the whole meal and</p>
<p>then let&rsquo;s say for example we skip this</p>
<p>and then we have one meal and two meal</p>
<p>and this process takes some time okay</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re what most people do burn</p>
<p>some ketones at night because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting but they&rsquo;re not key to adapt it</p>
<p>key to adaptive means you actually are</p>
<p>tapping into your fat cells and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually running on fat consistently not</p>
<p>sugar anymore so what&rsquo;s going to make</p>
<p>you go from one meal to the next without</p>
<p>the hunger and the cravings is adding</p>
<p>more fat and potassium from vegetables</p>
<p>so you want to act maybe I do a</p>
<p>supplement with potassium or magnesium</p>
<p>or some of the electrolytes just to</p>
<p>actually help you heal the real</p>
<p>underlying cause which is an insulin</p>
<p>dysfunction so the ketogenic diet is</p>
<p>basically your it&rsquo;s not about if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a high-fat diet it&rsquo;s a low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet and we just have to</p>
<p>add the fats in there to make up the</p>
<p>difference which the fats are going to</p>
<p>help you be more consistent you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>this on low fats because that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to starve you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>really really hungry so we have the</p>
<p>ketogenic which doesn&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>snacking so we&rsquo;re going to combine</p>
<p>ketogenic within a minute fasting so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we okay this is what you eat</p>
<p>this is the frequency of eating and add</p>
<p>more fat add more electrolytes with the</p>
<p>meals some B vitamins to help you adapt</p>
<p>faster because we&rsquo;re actually going from</p>
<p>sugar to fat metabolism and we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>this transition and your body takes time</p>
<p>and it requires certain nutrients so</p>
<p>give it time before you start adding</p>
<p>these steps and I have a lot of videos</p>
<p>on how to do this you should watch that</p>
<p>now the benefit of doing this is not</p>
<p>just weight loss its cognitive function</p>
<p>your brain does better on ketones that</p>
<p>actually you will repair</p>
<p>neurons you actually grow nerve cells I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s incredible it will help</p>
<p>anxiety because if you think about it if</p>
<p>your blood sugars I should be like 100</p>
<p>and drops down hypoglycemic and it goes</p>
<p>up and down as soon as the blood sugars</p>
<p>go down its senses certain types of</p>
<p>genes that that activate stress because</p>
<p>your body is sensing low glucose which</p>
<p>puts you in a flight or flight mode</p>
<p>which is survival mode so you have this</p>
<p>anxiety this lower mood and even</p>
<p>depression so when you do this plan your</p>
<p>mood improves greatly incredible no more</p>
<p>anxiety and we&rsquo;re depression more energy</p>
<p>the need for sleep goes down you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to need that nap anymore so you</p>
<p>can actually sleep better need less</p>
<p>sleep I need six hours myself I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even get more sleep like my body won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let me get sleep because I&rsquo;m satisfied</p>
<p>so these are all just little factors and</p>
<p>doing this even like seizures epilepsy</p>
<p>are all get improved with this eating</p>
<p>plan too but again you want to combine</p>
<p>it now if you want to take it to the</p>
<p>next level then you want to go from keep</p>
<p>stretching this right here and then push</p>
<p>the dinner this way slowly to the point</p>
<p>where we have a four hour eating window</p>
<p>okay so that means 20 hours 20 hours of</p>
<p>fasting that&rsquo;s incredible that that</p>
<p>would put you in good shape now if you</p>
<p>have a thyroid problem you&rsquo;re menopausal</p>
<p>and everything is slow then maybe you</p>
<p>want to go to one meal a day a lot of</p>
<p>people a lot of people basically do not</p>
<p>need to do even two meals I have body</p>
<p>builders that just do one meal a day</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just not hungry anymore</p>
<p>you would think that this would be</p>
<p>dangerous or you&rsquo;re starving but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the fact and when you experience</p>
<p>this when you&rsquo;re running up your body</p>
<p>and fat you&rsquo;re going to feel so good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to want to go back</p>
<p>because just the feeling of fat burning</p>
<p>and the stability with your blood sugars</p>
<p>and your mood and your energy but you</p>
<p>have to prove it to yourself don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>listen to me just do it and see for</p>
<p>yourself</p>
<p>so one meal a day</p>
<p>the key is when you go from three males</p>
<p>to two males to one male you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>and personally I don&rsquo;t do one meal I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I could do that but some</p>
<p>people can you want to make sure that</p>
<p>the nutrients not just general calories</p>
<p>but the nutrients are high enough on two</p>
<p>meals or even one meal so that means</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going for three meals or</p>
<p>two meals the meals have to be bigger so</p>
<p>how you going to do that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to increase the quality of food the</p>
<p>quality of vegetables you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to do iceberg lettuce you have to do</p>
<p>something like high quality and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to do maybe some kale or a</p>
<p>kale shake or like high quality eggs are</p>
<p>good grass-fed you know food wild-caught</p>
<p>fish and probably going to enhance your</p>
<p>diet with some type of food concentrate</p>
<p>supplement maybe the wheatgrass powder</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>but the point is that you might have</p>
<p>this incredibly full meal with more</p>
<p>protein eight maybe even the nine ounces</p>
<p>of protein a little more fat and a huge</p>
<p>thing of salad or vegetables that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to eat for that one</p>
<p>meal so you&rsquo;re going to be pretty filled</p>
<p>up but that is your nutrient requirement</p>
<p>so you can come all the way over here</p>
<p>and not go low nutrients and end up with</p>
<p>a situation where you&rsquo;re cutting</p>
<p>nutrients to do this and end up with</p>
<p>deficiencies vitamin deficiencies and</p>
<p>then stress the thyroid that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the mistake a lot of people make they go</p>
<p>on a low calorie low nutrient and they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just like going to man</p>
<p>fasting it&rsquo;s healthy but it&rsquo;s not so the</p>
<p>key is having nutrients so how do you</p>
<p>know if your low nutrients check out</p>
<p>your hair nail skin that&rsquo;s all being</p>
<p>retained your muscle density is doing</p>
<p>good that&rsquo;s all good but if you have</p>
<p>other problems like fatigue and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you know your weakness that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not having enough nutrients okay</p>
<p>so those are some of the changes that</p>
<p>you need to do and then one more point</p>
<p>is that if you do this and you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>like two meals a day or one mil a day</p>
<p>and you</p>
<p>feel that you&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re doing fine</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need as much fat well then</p>
<p>you can cut back on the fat because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning your own fat and your</p>
<p>metabolism will adjust to the point</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t need as much dietary fat</p>
<p>in the beginning because you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>on blood sugars if you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>fat or are like a keto bum it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>hard to go from one meal to the next but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re burning your own fat and</p>
<p>some hardcore key to adaptation the</p>
<p>amount of dietary fat you need will be</p>
<p>less almost like you&rsquo;ll feel nauseous if</p>
<p>you have too much fat so that&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>variable that you have to work with and</p>
<p>long if you do keto adaptation over a</p>
<p>period of a year and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>exercise on top of that your ability to</p>
<p>burn fat goes up by 3x or 2.5 to 3x oats</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to become a fat-burning</p>
<p>machine on steroids so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>require maybe some more fat but you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>surprised how the fat on your body a lot</p>
<p>of people have a lot more extra fat to</p>
<p>burn but it&rsquo;s more of a ficient fuel you</p>
<p>only have enough of sugar to last like</p>
<p>three days and then it&rsquo;s tapped out in</p>
<p>the storage sugar so our bodies have</p>
<p>incredible amounts of fat that can be</p>
<p>burned slowly so you can go longer on a</p>
<p>small amount of fat than you can on</p>
<p>stored sugar so that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need as much bad as you might think</p>
<p>especially the beginning you do so</p>
<p>anyway I gave you a lot of data I hope</p>
<p>you guys got some tips this time around</p>
<p>and I may or may not be doing next week</p>
<p>QA because I&rsquo;m doing this convention I</p>
<p>will send you an email to let you know</p>
<p>but thanks for watching and have a</p>
<p>wonderful day work depending on where</p>
<p>you live okay see you next time</p>
<p>you</p>
