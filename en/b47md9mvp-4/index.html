<p>um uh a number of other things these are</p>
<p>the main main items are from multiple</p>
<p>failed treatments to hatch pillory</p>
<p>both conventional medicine as well as</p>
<p>natural remedies and including some of</p>
<p>the remedies that you recommend uh it it</p>
<p>still remains in my system I these</p>
<p>symptoms are lack of energy lethargy</p>
<p>extreme bloating no strength short of</p>
<p>breath</p>
<p>you know the the minute I do any kind of</p>
<p>activity</p>
<p>on on blood testing the blood</p>
<p>inflammation levels are a good</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s deficiency in active B12</p>
<p>LDL as I just mentioned High 4.8 when it</p>
<p>needs to be about two</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m on on a lot of supplements uh you</p>
<p>know the enzymes before food broccoli</p>
<p>Sprouts</p>
<p>the zinc</p>
<p>with food other supplements such as</p>
<p>turmeric coffee</p>
<p>empty stomach</p>
<p>B12 B1 iodine</p>
<p>lipoic acid acid vitamin C is for</p>
<p>nursing</p>
<p>I I I I and I and I guess the issue is</p>
<p>Hilary and sibo which are kind of you</p>
<p>know when you&rsquo;re trying to fix sibo you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fix head region when you&rsquo;re fixing</p>
<p>hatch battery you can&rsquo;t fix sibo</p>
<p>um and and it&rsquo;s been two years uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just I&rsquo;m not able to deliver normal</p>
<p>lifestyle I I don&rsquo;t know what to do okay</p>
<p>so that was a great one one question a</p>
<p>quick quick one but I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you what I would recommend okay</p>
<p>um and you can watch this later because</p>
<p>I want to go quite rapidly the thing</p>
<p>with the small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth is you have a competition</p>
<p>between</p>
<p>um these microbes</p>
<p>and your own body they&rsquo;re stealing all</p>
<p>your nutrition so they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>leaving you deficient so that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>have to take it because it&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>microbes should be kind of hanging out</p>
<p>in the in the large bowel but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hanging out in the small and small</p>
<p>intestine</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re you shouldn&rsquo;t have all</p>
<p>this fermentation going on there because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the wrong place so that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>get the bloating so one thing you have</p>
<p>to be careful about is feeding them</p>
<p>um so I would cut off any fiber and go</p>
<p>carnivore right away because if you give</p>
<p>them fiber from plants or anything</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;ll eat it they&rsquo;ll um eat it and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll keep keep alive</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the most important probably supplement</p>
<p>would be betaine hydrochloride in larger</p>
<p>amounts if you can tolerate let&rsquo;s say I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know 10 tablets</p>
<p>before each meal</p>
<p>that will acidify the stomach okay so</p>
<p>then now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got an acid stomach it&rsquo;ll stop</p>
<p>these microbes from</p>
<p>any other microbes from the food going</p>
<p>into the small intestine that&rsquo;ll kill</p>
<p>things off it takes a while to build</p>
<p>that up but that will also help uh</p>
<p>trigger the bile salts the bile so you</p>
<p>probably have to take some purified bile</p>
<p>salts after the meal and also an empty</p>
<p>stomach play around with the dosage and</p>
<p>because think about this the bile I</p>
<p>think you have a bile problem because</p>
<p>the bile normally made by the liver that</p>
<p>goes in the gallbladder goes in the</p>
<p>small intestine and one function is to</p>
<p>make sure</p>
<p>uh all these microbes in the small</p>
<p>intestine can&rsquo;t survive so it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>detergent it kills microbes so it sounds</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have that happening so if</p>
<p>we do the bile salts as well as HCL</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid from the betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>then we can actually um</p>
<p>do good things now</p>
<p>the other icing on the cake is going to</p>
<p>be the fasting I would highly recommend</p>
<p>uh have one meal a day and then do</p>
<p>do prolonged fasting maybe once a week</p>
<p>until</p>
<p>you can have Good Housekeeping and that</p>
<p>you you have a flush of all these</p>
<p>different microbes out of the body</p>
<p>because that way you can actually start</p>
<p>them off and then your body can live on</p>
<p>your ketones which is your stored fat so</p>
<p>that would be like the most important</p>
<p>things to focus on right now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>and then once things are better</p>
<p>then what you can do is then you can</p>
<p>start adding like the maybe the</p>
<p>Probiotic foods and things like that</p>
<p>back in there like sauerkraut stuff like</p>
<p>that but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m gonna get the system back on</p>
<p>track</p>
<p>sounds great all right Harry thanks so</p>
<p>much for coming to us from uh Melbourne</p>
<p>and we hope that you call us back and</p>
<p>let us know just how that all went and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to social media so first up</p>
<p>from Facebook uh is Chris how can I</p>
<p>improve uh upon getting sleepy after I</p>
<p>eat he gets very sleepy after he eats so</p>
<p>how can we uh help Chris out</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um it depends if you&rsquo;re eating eating</p>
<p>Donuts or find carbs and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>sleepy then you have a blood sugar crash</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not then uh two things</p>
<p>either take the this thing called</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride to help you digest</p>
<p>the food you may be eating too much</p>
<p>protein which could also kind of uh turn</p>
<p>in the sugar and make you kind of tired</p>
<p>if you overload protein</p>
<p>um but definitely start get get rid of</p>
<p>any carbs that will help you and then</p>
<p>the last thing to uh to realize though</p>
<p>some people you know I I talk to some</p>
<p>people and they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing carbs and they&rsquo;re still getting</p>
<p>tired and and their their stomach is</p>
<p>fine but I find out they just don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>enough hours of sleep</p>
<p>and um that&rsquo;s a problem that uh can</p>
<p>easily be solved if you watch some sleep</p>
<p>videos so those are three simple quick</p>
<p>things that you could wrap your wits</p>
<p>around terrific okay now you won&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to um struggle over answering this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a question it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>statement Don uh don Louis from YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 22 pounds</p>
<p>on your program and my stomach acids are</p>

<p>the uh Philippines Nigeria Iran Ethiopia</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia Montenegro Croatia Estonia</p>
<p>Palestine welcome Palestine Belgium and</p>
<p>all across these United States so thanks</p>
<p>everybody for checking in uh and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go straight back to social media</p>
<p>uh Thomas from Facebook I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>reading about the keto diet can oh cause</p>
<p>thyroid issues and causing people to go</p>
<p>on thyroid medicine have you come across</p>
<p>these cases in your research that awful</p>
<p>Keto</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing cutting out</p>
<p>those carbs I tell you it just leads to</p>
<p>all sorts of side effects</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s completely false I mean</p>
<p>if you keto is really the reduction of</p>
<p>carbs it doesn&rsquo;t really talk about the</p>
<p>quality of food doesn&rsquo;t talk about the</p>
<p>nutrition</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re doing something called the</p>
<p>healthy version of a ketogenic diet your</p>
<p>thyroid is not going to be a problem in</p>
<p>fact you&rsquo;re going to be more efficient</p>
<p>to the point where the thyroid doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to work so hard and you may even</p>
<p>not need as many of those thyroid</p>
<p>hormones to have everything work so you</p>
<p>may see a a little bit of a lowering of</p>
<p>like T4 or even T3 but it it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>within normal range but the the thing</p>
<p>that people diagnose</p>
<p>hypothyroidism with is something called</p>
<p>the thyroid stimulating hormone that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pituitary hormone that will always just</p>
<p>stay normal so nothing to worry about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just eating healthy foods with</p>
<p>low carbs so for someone to say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to damage the thyroid why because</p>
<p>the thyroid needs carbs like explain</p>
<p>that to me I&rsquo;d like to see just one</p>
<p>study that show that it&rsquo;s a logical yep</p>
<p>that makes sense to me I&rsquo;ll heat from</p>
<p>YouTube how can I increase my HDL it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always between 28 and 30. boy that does</p>
<p>sound low I&rsquo;m 47 and on blood pressure</p>
<p>meds I get my blood tested every four</p>
<p>months everything is normal except for</p>
<p>this really low HDL</p>
<p>well I would um</p>
<p>um one thing that causes low human</p>
<p>growth hormone would be age</p>
<p>so how do you solve that right well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>exercise intense exercise with a lot of</p>
<p>rest will increase growth hormone also</p>
<p>more sleep will increase growth hormone</p>
<p>um arginine is a supplement that will</p>
<p>kill two birds with one stone it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>increase Arginine plus it will help you</p>
<p>with blood pressure because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like a precursor to the something called</p>
<p>nitric oxide which supports the inside</p>
<p>of the vascular system uh which I will</p>
<p>release the video on that too</p>
<p>um I mean if you think these the</p>
<p>medications for blood pressure you have</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>big one that&rsquo;s always given which is a</p>
<p>diuretic which depletes potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium which the two things that you</p>
<p>need to keep the blood pressure low and</p>
<p>then you have the ACE inhibitors and</p>
<p>then you have the calcium channel</p>
<p>blockers so these things all just um</p>
<p>have side effects and um</p>
<p>as far as growth hormone goes going back</p>
<p>to sticking on that topic I would</p>
<p>definitely focus on</p>
<p>going low carb okay because too much</p>
<p>sugar will inhibit uh growth hormone and</p>
<p>then um</p>
<p>and then also the sleep and the exercise</p>
<p>and then of course you can throw in the</p>
<p>Arginine too but</p>
<p>um only only if you really need it</p>
<p>um but make sure your exercise has</p>
<p>enough recovery so you get enough so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t over train because that&rsquo;ll because</p>
<p>the cortisol the stress will really shut</p>
<p>it down too surgeon might be on growth</p>
<p>hormone I have quite a few and I give a</p>
<p>lot of additional</p>
<p>things to do</p>
<p>all right sounds great and by the way</p>
<p>and when Dr uh Berg says search here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way to do it he&rsquo;s got his nice app</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about you can get it</p>
<p>on uh you know on Mac or any of the</p>
<p>Android phones so make sure you check</p>
<p>that out and find the answers to your</p>
<p>many questions all right uh let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re enough is the handle from this</p>
<p>person on YouTube can a colloidal silver</p>
<p>help uh with bowel issues like</p>
<p>diverticulitis</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would be the the best</p>
<p>remedy it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt it&rsquo;s good for a</p>
<p>lot of things related to infection</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s an infection down there</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;d probably be good but with the</p>
<p>bow</p>
<p>related I mean if I</p>
<p>if I wanted to become a medical doctor</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be a GI doc because it</p>
<p>would be so easy and so dramatic to turn</p>
<p>things around because one thing</p>
<p>is uh</p>
<p>GA doctors don&rsquo;t really emphasize enough</p>
<p>is the the food here they&rsquo;re studying</p>
<p>the digestive tract but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really get into the connection between</p>
<p>what you eat very much it&rsquo;s mainly here</p>
<p>take an anti-spice spasmodic medication</p>
<p>and acid take pain pills and</p>
<p>go get some Pepto-Bismol you know so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like um what about the food the</p>
<p>food that you&rsquo;re eating and especially</p>
<p>inflammation in the colon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh bone broth like if you made a made</p>
<p>your own bone brothness you buy some</p>
<p>bones and you cut them in half or you</p>
<p>buy them already cut in half and you</p>
<p>make your own bone broth with it in with</p>
<p>the stew</p>
<p>synthetic meat in there the fat is</p>
<p>really good you can even put vegetables</p>
<p>in there cook it down with some spices</p>
<p>garlic that would be a really good um</p>
<p>gut healing</p>
<p>food that um</p>
<p>that all that without collagen and uh</p>
<p>um bone broth I mean that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>really help your gut in a big way so</p>
<p>that would just be like one simple thing</p>
<p>I would recommend rather than quite a</p>
<p>little silver which might not create the</p>
<p>impact that you want</p>
<p>sounds great and black butterfly from</p>
<p>YouTube is an A1C of 6 or 6.5 okay will</p>
<p>keto make a difference</p>
<p>well it all depends what you what it</p>
<p>used to be if it was seven before now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 6.5 and then it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s you want to get it down to like</p>
<p>5.5 or even a little bit less because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring an average blood sugar</p>
<p>over a few months like maybe three two</p>
<p>months and um what what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring how much sugar got</p>
<p>stuck to that hemoglobin and then the</p>
<p>red blood cells die so then the recycle</p>
<p>starts all over so you can kind of see</p>
<p>how much sugar you&rsquo;ve been eating which</p>
<p>is interesting because a lot of people</p>
<p>will say well I don&rsquo;t eat sugar and then</p>
<p>they and then they go well just on the</p>
<p>weekends well you&rsquo;re looking at an</p>
<p>average of blood sugars so if you</p>
<p>calculate those days in there</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s gonna be higher so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I like A1C even better than a</p>
<p>blood sugar because just a typical blood</p>
<p>glucose test because you can</p>
<p>you really see what&rsquo;s happening if the</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s cheating or not not they would</p>
<p>ever cheat but</p>
<p>yeah well I think they do and by the way</p>
<p>if I might a friend of mine just got</p>
<p>denied surgery a couple days ago he has</p>
<p>a stenosis in his neck and they said his</p>
<p>his A1C of 8.5 or something is too high</p>
<p>until he gets it down to 6.5 they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to cut him open is 8.5 really bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not that great I mean I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen it people have up to 11. so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good</p>
<p>um it just tells me they&rsquo;re eating too</p>
<p>many carbs well he does he&rsquo;s a mini</p>
<p>Snicker bar fanatic so it shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>too hard for him to behave all right why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go back to our Green Room Mark</p>
<p>as our next sleepiest guy uh on the ramp</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in Southern California was uh on</p>
<p>the air we&rsquo;re on the Queue with us at 7</p>
<p>30 in the morning and Mark if you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>unmute yourself we&rsquo;d ask your one</p>
<p>question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>good morning dog good morning hey I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using a couple of your supplements</p>
<p>and I already have called in to the</p>
<p>customer service and asked what makes a</p>
<p>complete supplement regimen and what I</p>
<p>have what I was told is this</p>
<p>the D3 plus the K2</p>
<p>the keto energy</p>
<p>The Organic Raw wheatgrass</p>
<p>and the trace minerals those four items</p>
<p>would that be a complete supplement yeah</p>
<p>I think I would probably just add one</p>
<p>little thing and that&rsquo;s the electrolytes</p>
<p>because that way you can get the uh the</p>
<p>benefit of potassium it&rsquo;s so wild that</p>
<p>they press the powder I&rsquo;m sorry that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the powder okay and I have that also</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right then you&rsquo;re then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good to go that&rsquo;s actually money and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do be in good shape but</p>
<p>you know you try to find a potassium</p>
<p>supplement it&rsquo;s really only like 99</p>
<p>milligrams they sell it and so I mean we</p>
<p>need 4 700 milligrams so that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>on the low side but yeah it sounds like</p>
<p>a good protocol I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>so how much of that should I use the</p>
<p>electrical like drink how much of that</p>
<p>should I use it per day I think you just</p>
<p>need one one to enhance your diet</p>
<p>um depending on what you&rsquo;re doing I mean</p>
<p>if you have a lot of fluid retention you</p>
<p>can take more or if you um let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>exercise uh you want to spike your</p>
<p>energy take that right before you work</p>
<p>out Watch What Happens I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a a shift in your energy</p>
<p>I am I&rsquo;m about um six one 193 I have</p>
<p>dropped about seven pounds since I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started following you wow that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>getting to the because I&rsquo;m not extremely</p>
<p>I have a lot to wait to lose but</p>
<p>maybe another five or ten wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>bad so that&rsquo;s great sounds like I</p>
<p>appreciate your stuff it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very reasonable and good information so</p>
<p>thanks Mark that&rsquo;s great thanks so much</p>
<p>for joining us Mark we appreciate it as</p>
<p>you continue to uh drop down and wait</p>
<p>and increase health we always love to</p>
<p>have our participants come back and and</p>
<p>give us another Glimpse at their</p>
<p>progress and so on so thank you for that</p>
<p>oh you know what boy I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve bombed</p>
<p>out on the questions let&rsquo;s get going</p>
<p>here doc here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>okay so um uh let me try to click this</p>
<p>thing to see if I could pop it up so I</p>
<p>could see here we go okay good okay the</p>
<p>best antidote for salt sensitivity is</p>
<p>fill in the blank now salt sensitivity</p>
<p>is the kind of like where you uh you eat</p>
<p>salt and you retain fluid you retain</p>
<p>sodium and you&rsquo;re retaining fluid so</p>
<p>what is the best remedy for that the</p>
<p>antidote to that salt sensitivity all</p>
<p>right sounds great an audience I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll help me out uh I am remiss and</p>
<p>not getting these up quick enough so</p>
<p>launch into that we&rsquo;re going to get all</p>
<p>five quiz questions answered uh in spite</p>
<p>of my tardiness on that issue okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to social media Mary from</p>
<p>Facebook what could be behind a craving</p>
<p>for vinegar that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>well I think I think there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>reasons but um it could be that you need</p>
<p>more help with your digestion but also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>acetic acid in the vinegar has um</p>
<p>amazing benefits that uh help to</p>
<p>reestablish like pH for example so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say your pH is running more on the</p>
<p>alkaline side than it should</p>
<p>um then you probably crave acids so that</p>
<p>could be one reason and you take it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like wow I feel so much better</p>
<p>like people you can even breathe better</p>
<p>because the pH</p>
<p>comes back to where it needs to be now</p>
<p>some people will say well I thought the</p>
<p>pH was supposed to be alkaline well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re looking at the blood right</p>
<p>it should be slightly alkaline</p>
<p>but um sometimes it&rsquo;s just off a little</p>
<p>bit either too high or too low too acid</p>
<p>or two alkaline and so we need it in</p>
<p>this very narrow range and so um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like everything is revolves</p>
<p>around with that blood pH but</p>
<p>um realize that every part of your body</p>
<p>has a different pH so um</p>
<p>um your stomach is really acid so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to just alkalize the body</p>
<p>thinking that that&rsquo;s the most healthiest</p>
<p>thing in the world because you can end</p>
<p>up alkalizing your stomach and creating</p>
<p>a whole bunch of problems very good okay</p>
<p>man preet from YouTube I am 38 a</p>
<p>vegetarian and have hypothyroidism I</p>
<p>have tried everything to lose weight but</p>
<p>no success please share your best advice</p>
<p>difficult being a vegetarian because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to keep your carbs low and</p>
<p>keep the fat high and keep all the</p>
<p>nutrition in but I think you said you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a vegan or vegetarian so you can</p>
<p>have eggs right so</p>
<p>um maybe have more eggs but there are a</p>
<p>couple things to really look at is your</p>
<p>results are going to be dependent on you</p>
<p>really addressing that insulin</p>
<p>resistance and keep the insulin as low</p>
<p>as possible by cutting down the carbs so</p>
<p>you can do it but it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>difficult you cut down the carbs get</p>
<p>more sleep</p>
<p>you make sure that your um</p>
<p>your stress is as low as possible go for</p>
<p>long walks do physical activity outside</p>
<p>to keep the stress down and exercise</p>
<p>um these and I have a huge list of</p>
<p>additional things if you plateau</p>
<p>um what you could do is pull up my</p>
<p>videos based on plateauing and always</p>
<p>look at the most recent one because</p>
<p>those are the most updated one like</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m going to be doing a</p>
<p>some updated videos on things that I</p>
<p>found related to blood pressure that I</p>
<p>like you need to know this if you have</p>
<p>blood pressure so I&rsquo;m always constantly</p>
<p>finding new things so stay tuned for</p>
<p>that but um that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend all right very good and we</p>
<p>must go to Christine from YouTube can</p>
<p>you talk about the best diet plan and</p>
<p>supplements for someone who has been</p>
<p>diagnosed with breast cancer or sorry to</p>
<p>hear that Christine what do you think</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>that too I would find my most recent uh</p>
<p>video on cancer we there&rsquo;s a protocol</p>
<p>that you can download</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not making any claims but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little protocol that I would</p>
<p>recommend of what I would do if I had</p>
<p>cancer there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p>fasting involved like prolonged fasting</p>
<p>depending on how severe the the cancer</p>
<p>is the more fasting you need to do I do</p>
<p>not provide any supplements for this</p>
<p>protocol</p>
<p>um but we we list out a protocol that</p>
<p>will help to inhibit a certain pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in the cancer cells</p>
<p>making their membranes and if you can</p>
<p>starve them off of that there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>really good research to actually make</p>
<p>the cancer go bye-bye but again read</p>
<p>that look at it decide</p>
<p>um and then of course check with your</p>
<p>doctor before implementing any of these</p>
<p>crazy suggestions absolutely okay thank</p>
<p>you audience uh who immediately answered</p>
<p>the first question which asked the best</p>
<p>antidote for salt sensitivity is and uh</p>
<p>80 of our respondents say potassium or</p>
<p>magnesium and 10 say uh coenzyme I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry qq10 uh and five percent say</p>
<p>hallium and five percent say drink more</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>yeah the answer is potassium yeah</p>
<p>potassium and sodium work together</p>
<p>um so many people are focused on</p>
<p>reducing sodium instead of increasing</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>sodium does no longer become sensitive</p>
<p>if you get the ratios right if you</p>
<p>increase your your potassium you need</p>
<p>twice as much potassium as you do sodium</p>
<p>and then when you&rsquo;re low in potassium</p>
<p>guess what your body retains sodium so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like not good</p>
<p>um a lot of problems go away when you</p>
<p>increase potassium especially if you</p>
<p>have any problem with sodium or anything</p>
<p>related to that and with some people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re low on sodium and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>low in potassium and so now they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have those key electrolytes to keep</p>
<p>things going so they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>always tired and things like that so in</p>
<p>some cases they need to take more sea</p>
<p>salt and they make more potassium and to</p>
<p>get that those electrolytes</p>
<p>working and then they&rsquo;ll feel so much</p>
<p>better so much better because then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have more volume of fluid in</p>
<p>their body and they&rsquo;ll have more blood</p>
<p>but um these are really key nutrients to</p>
<p>power the nervous system which is</p>
<p>connected to your muscles</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to have more nerve</p>
<p>support with as well as muscle power</p>
<p>very good okay next question doc here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>all right the primary symptom of low</p>
<p>sodium is fill in the blank climb on it</p>
<p>audience okay let&rsquo;s see Claire from</p>
<p>YouTube is a low carb diet recommended</p>
<p>for children who are diabetics</p>
<p>especially especially because the very</p>
<p>thing that caused the diabetes in the</p>
<p>first place was too many carbs now if</p>
<p>they have our Diabetic Type 1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an autoimmune condition and they</p>
<p>still need the same diet because then</p>
<p>they can actually at least reduce the</p>
<p>quantity of medication they&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>and because I mean that&rsquo;s a proven fact</p>
<p>if you are a diabetic type one the more</p>
<p>carbs you take the more medication you</p>
<p>need well okay so why don&rsquo;t we just take</p>
<p>the least amount possible</p>
<p>uh by getting on the right diet</p>
<p>very good of course always monitor your</p>
<p>blood sugars because things will change</p>
<p>like if if you&rsquo;re afraid if a doctor is</p>
<p>afraid of</p>
<p>patient developing hypoglycemia because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re reducing their carbs</p>
<p>well then just make some adjustments on</p>
<p>the medication and watch what happens I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s just the medication is there</p>
<p>to lower the blood pressure blood sugar</p>
<p>so if your blood sugar comes down and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still taking medication</p>
<p>that would not be logical</p>
<p>all right thank you Dr Berg for that</p>
<p>Anna from Facebook how can I treat</p>
<p>lymphedema</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a difficult one</p>
<p>um because the limb system is um</p>
<p>you know when you have the</p>
<p>like the even the valves in the lens</p>
<p>system that are overstretched and you</p>
<p>have these dilation of of the lymph</p>
<p>nodes and um or lymphatic system in your</p>
<p>retaining fluid</p>
<p>um what what I think the best thing to</p>
<p>do is to increase the exercise too</p>
<p>because the lymph system is a passive</p>
<p>system and it needs um it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>um like a muscular pumps like the basket</p>
<p>that the arteries do so if you were to</p>
<p>actively stay in motion and do more of</p>
<p>that that would help you to a large</p>
<p>degree</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Malcolm who&rsquo;s from Scotland on Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suffering from indigestion and acid</p>
<p>reflux and diarrhea the big Trifecta of</p>
<p>suffering what sort of adjustments do I</p>
<p>need to make uh to my diet so that he</p>
<p>can overcome this terrible thing so so</p>
<p>we have three things there there uh</p>
<p>oh sure there&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got indigestion</p>
<p>acid reflux and to top it off some</p>
<p>diarrhea</p>
<p>this is an easy one very easy anytime</p>
<p>you have indigestion all that means is</p>
<p>you need to get more acid in your</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>um then the valve the valve on the top</p>
<p>of the stomach will close so you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>less backup of acid coming into your</p>
<p>esophagus and you&rsquo;ll probably have more</p>
<p>complete digestion which means it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably help your diarrhea but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forget to take a probiotic if you have</p>
<p>diarrhea that&rsquo;s important but um betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride the betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>should be your go-to supplement and</p>
<p>sometimes you need</p>
<p>a lot of it so start off with like maybe</p>
<p>three with the meal and then go up I</p>
<p>keep adding one until these symptoms go</p>
<p>away and you may end up taking 10 before</p>
<p>a meal my guitar teacher found out he</p>
<p>had to take like nine or ten</p>
<p>uh for symptoms go away so then you</p>
<p>could go back to consuming his uh</p>
<p>large hamburgers and stuff and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>no no no no that&rsquo;s not the goal the goal</p>
<p>is to oh get your diet cleared up I know</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s shocking all right very good</p>
<p>well uh what else is not shocking is our</p>
<p>audience&rsquo;s quick response to our</p>
<p>questions I think I&rsquo;m going to call us</p>
<p>caught up and the last one asked the</p>
<p>primary symptom of low sodium is 75</p>
<p>percent uh say fatigue or dizziness 15</p>
<p>say headaches and 10 say low blood</p>
<p>pressure any uh any</p>
<p>Geniuses out there there&rsquo;s one really</p>
<p>big one that happens first and that is</p>
<p>weakness you will feel weak in the</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>anytime you feel weak take a little sea</p>
<p>salt and like wow I feel so much better</p>
<p>so that would explain too</p>
<p>um like if you exercising and you feel</p>
<p>kind of weak</p>
<p>um sometimes you just need a little sea</p>
<p>salt and then boom your muscles like</p>
<p>respond I&rsquo;m not talking about where you</p>
<p>have this you hit the wall where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exercising you deplete your glycogen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely different I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about just weakness in general</p>
<p>all right I think we can probably give</p>
<p>that to the 75 percent they say fatigue</p>
<p>and so on maybe you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track folks so thank you for that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Peg from Facebook I have stage three</p>
<p>liver fibrosis and I&rsquo;ve lost 35 pounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great start I am not hungry at</p>
<p>all and have a hard time eating</p>
<p>sufficient salads veggies and protein I</p>
<p>eat once a day around 5 PM what can I do</p>
<p>to supplement my diet</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re on the right track I</p>
<p>would make sure if you have the fibrosis</p>
<p>um is to take tocotranals that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good one for the liver</p>
<p>the other thing is um</p>
<p>yeah I like the idea of the one meal a</p>
<p>day so what you probably will have to do</p>
<p>is eat your meal and maybe even maybe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know wait a little bit and then</p>
<p>have your maybe your salad because it is</p>
<p>hard to eat everything in one time so</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always a situation but you can</p>
<p>enhance it with um a greens product a</p>
<p>really high quality one and of course</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to I&rsquo;m not biased of my</p>
<p>own greens product but something like</p>
<p>that would be good that&rsquo;s freeze-dried</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>um doesn&rsquo;t have high heat</p>
<p>um one thing I&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>um also recommending is too like if you</p>
<p>had</p>
<p>so you have this huge salad right and</p>
<p>you have a hard time doing all that well</p>
<p>you could also you could eat more</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can do Sprouts or these uh mini</p>
<p>greens these uh</p>
<p>these smaller like the little um they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called micro greens and that would</p>
<p>actually have</p>
<p>um more concentrated</p>
<p>properties for the liver phytonutrients</p>
<p>and things like that so maybe you can</p>
<p>have a little less of that and get by</p>
<p>with the concentrated nutrition so the</p>
<p>micro greens um</p>
<p>of the wave of the future</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh yeah sometimes if you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing them hydroponic if you</p>
<p>have the if you have the option of</p>
<p>getting them from growing on dirt that</p>
<p>would be better there&rsquo;s if you happen to</p>
<p>live in</p>
<p>Washington DC or Maryland there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market</p>
<p>in Bethesda it&rsquo;s on Sundays that they</p>
<p>they grow theirs in um</p>
<p>soil and I really like them like that</p>
<p>company but because they&rsquo;re like doing</p>
<p>it right so you&rsquo;d stop there and get get</p>
<p>your micro greens</p>
<p>wow I think we&rsquo;re gonna need a new bell</p>
<p>here Sarah from Facebook has lost 80</p>
<p>plus pounds with fasting and your</p>
<p>Healthy keto since July</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg that&rsquo;s a great great</p>
<p>thing to hear Sarah congratulations</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s another boy all</p>
<p>these names giving with a purpose is</p>
<p>asking what are some natural ways to</p>
<p>address narcolepsy I am on several</p>
<p>medications and struggling thank you Dr</p>
<p>Burke</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a tough one</p>
<p>um the I think the best thing to do</p>
<p>um well without getting into the history</p>
<p>of what happened just before that</p>
<p>um because I do know that</p>
<p>um that can happen after certain</p>
<p>vaccines which I can&rsquo;t really talk about</p>
<p>too much right now but I will say</p>
<p>um if you start taking more B1 okay</p>
<p>higher amounts of B1 that can help you</p>
<p>but um I tell you what though I will do</p>
<p>a video I&rsquo;ll work on the video on that</p>
<p>to give you a more complete answer just</p>
<p>to give you the whole whole scoop</p>
<p>all right well uh Abraham from Modesto</p>
<p>California seems like a nice fellow so</p>
<p>uh we will put him on in the hopes that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true go ahead with your one</p>
<p>question Abraham</p>
<p>yes hi Dr Berg hello</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I just want to know if I could still</p>
<p>lose fat without having my gallbladder</p>
<p>oh yeah absolutely you could you can do</p>
<p>fine you could actually consume more fat</p>
<p>it just just a matter here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right you don&rsquo;t have the um</p>
<p>the gallbladder and the gallbladder has</p>
<p>a very important function that is not</p>
<p>emphasized it concentrates that bile</p>
<p>that means that if you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be as concentrated so</p>
<p>you might not get the complete breakdown</p>
<p>of that fat so you have two things you</p>
<p>got the bile and then it releases a</p>
<p>pancreas that helps you break down from</p>
<p>an enzyme standpoint so you have this</p>
<p>mixture here that&rsquo;s going on so</p>
<p>um I would take some bile salts right</p>
<p>after the meal maybe a few and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be fine I think you&rsquo;ll be totally</p>
<p>fine and now the way that you know that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>is that if your stool is floating that</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s fat in the stool that</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not working so you</p>
<p>need more of this bile if it if your</p>
<p>stool is dark and tarry and it leaves a</p>
<p>skid mark that means you might need help</p>
<p>from the pancreas you need enzymes</p>
<p>specially lipase if the stool is</p>
<p>light colored and pale or gray that</p>
<p>means you need more bile if you have</p>
<p>diarrhea you&rsquo;ve taken too much</p>
<p>so these just little indications of how</p>
<p>to make the adjustments without doing a</p>
<p>expensive test</p>
<p>I have been trying</p>
<p>your gallbladder formula here</p>
<p>okay good then also</p>
<p>um you might you might it might be like</p>
<p>one or two might be enough so I think uh</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be fine on that first and</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>um somehow um</p>
<p>the way the Ducks adapt they even grow a</p>
<p>gallbladder back I&rsquo;m not kidding so who</p>
<p>knows you might grow on back</p>
<p>well that that&rsquo;s great well thanks so</p>
<p>much Abraham I&rsquo;m going to award you the</p>
<p>award for the most succinct question</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever had on our show and that is</p>
<p>fantastic and we wish you all the best</p>
<p>uh Sans gallbladder uh you know as you</p>
<p>move forward all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to social media uh</p>
<p>uh oh here we go choose uh choose Joy is</p>
<p>is the name from YouTube what are the</p>
<p>best natural ways to treat</p>
<p>hypothyroidism and Graves disease</p>
<p>well I always like when people ask me</p>
<p>questions to treat diseases</p>
<p>um and of course</p>
<p>check with your doctor but it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>autoimmune disease so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>than a thyroid problem it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>autoimmune disease so the thyroid is</p>
<p>working too hard and um there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>triggers to this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny that I just talked about B1</p>
<p>being a remedy for so many things but B1</p>
<p>is a good remedy</p>
<p>not to handle it but to help it but the</p>
<p>other key remedy would be vitamin D3</p>
<p>large amounts because that will reduce</p>
<p>the inflammation</p>
<p>but again you know</p>
<p>you know you work hopefully you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with your doctor that can make</p>
<p>these adjustments to slow things down a</p>
<p>bit because</p>
<p>um you know you have a lot of</p>
<p>complications the heart working harder</p>
<p>and your eyeballs you know bulging out</p>
<p>and things like that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an autoimmune which chances are</p>
<p>something may have been triggered in the</p>
<p>gut</p>
<p>uh and now your immune system is kind of</p>
<p>inappropriately responding</p>
<p>so vitamin D is the best way to at least</p>
<p>reduce the um the inflammation part of</p>
<p>it which might might just put that whole</p>
<p>thing in remission</p>
<p>all right very good next question sir</p>
<p>this is a true false sir</p>
<p>okay true or false</p>
<p>if you have polyps in your colon your</p>
<p>risk for colon cancer</p>
<p>is very high</p>
<p>All Right audience climb onto that one I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t believe Terry you making this up</p>
<p>mask of Sanity is our latest</p>
<p>questionnaire from YouTube what is the</p>
<p>best uh in your opinion thiamin or</p>
<p>benphotamine</p>
<p>well um it depends if you have any type</p>
<p>of neurological problems let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>have peripheral neuropathy and your your</p>
<p>fingers or your feet or you have um</p>
<p>Dementia or you you have Alzheimer&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking this bin you should take</p>
<p>but Ben photamine because it&rsquo;s a fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamin that penetrates the</p>
<p>brain and nervous system because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to the fat membranes but</p>
<p>for other things</p>
<p>um you can just do a natural B1 that</p>
<p>will work just just fine like for</p>
<p>example one of the big reasons people</p>
<p>take B1 is because they have this</p>
<p>nervous energy and stress that they have</p>
<p>to reduce boy within minutes you&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>feel like oh I can I feel relaxed you</p>
<p>know so you can get that from</p>
<p>nutritional yeast or just in a</p>
<p>supplement form</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yes very good okay Christy from Facebook</p>
<p>how can I do healthy keto if I&rsquo;m prone</p>
<p>to kidney stones</p>
<p>just take</p>
<p>um Regular</p>
<p>um amounts of lemon in your water I</p>
<p>would recommend just taking the whole</p>
<p>lemon just blending one with water and</p>
<p>and maybe a little electrolytes in there</p>
<p>as a drink in the morning that would be</p>
<p>really great but also the most important</p>
<p>thing is to take consume at least two</p>
<p>and a half liters of</p>
<p>fluids a day and that way it&rsquo;ll keep</p>
<p>your urine from becoming super saturated</p>
<p>and developing a stone regardless if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re prone to stones or not it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>almost impossible to get a stone if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking this fluid on a regular</p>
<p>basis so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>and um also I you know I</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t do many commercials for my</p>
<p>products or even</p>
<p>um other products but every once in a</p>
<p>while I find a good product</p>
<p>um that I endorse and this product I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you right now I have no</p>
<p>affiliation with the company never even</p>
<p>contacted them but I found a I was at</p>
<p>the store and I found this interesting</p>
<p>grain-free grain free cracker that I</p>
<p>really was impressed and I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>you know when I found a good product I</p>
<p>like to tell people about it so you can</p>
<p>see this is uh</p>
<p>by who</p>
<p>hu I guess it&rsquo;s called grain free</p>
<p>cracker let me just tell you what I like</p>
<p>about this um no tapioca no gluten no</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>no sunflower oil no lecithin no seed or</p>
<p>vegetable oils no maltodextrin hey you</p>
<p>got me right there that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>nowhere fine starches because so many of</p>
<p>these crackers have tapioca starch or</p>
<p>other starches that are potato starch</p>
<p>that are these and they call it keto</p>
<p>right so what does this have in it it</p>
<p>has uh almond cassava organic coconut</p>
<p>flour perfect organic sesame seed chia</p>
<p>seed onion sea salt flax seed</p>
<p>and uh garlic and rosemary extract so I</p>
<p>was like Wow and it it&rsquo;s not too bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it tastes tastes great when you put</p>
<p>like your cheese on it or something but</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s always hard to find a good</p>
<p>cracker that doesn&rsquo;t have these other</p>
<p>things in it so</p>
<p>um yeah this is a</p>
<p>no Kickback endorsement</p>
<p>they also have other chocolates with</p>
<p>with sweet and things like that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend those but this is one product</p>
<p>that I would definitely recommend if</p>
<p>someone wanted to get a cracker not as a</p>
<p>snack but you know with the meal very</p>
<p>good okay latest question asked was a</p>
<p>true falser if you have polyps your risk</p>
<p>of colon cancer will be high and the</p>
<p>audience has addressed this 65 percent</p>
<p>respondents say that that&rsquo;s true and the</p>
<p>other 35 percent say it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>you know this is actually false it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>as common like there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m gonna do a</p>
<p>video on this but there&rsquo;s like four main</p>
<p>kinds of polyps right and 80 of the time</p>
<p>you really only have like a two percent</p>
<p>chance of of having it turn into cancer</p>
<p>so the great majority of time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>benign so you don&rsquo;t have to freak out if</p>
<p>you have a polyp</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s good news</p>
<p>um but if you do have a polyp</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know just um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another motivation to eat</p>
<p>clean you know because really what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with is your food and um</p>
<p>yes smoking can be a factor</p>
<p>um but also the food so as long as you</p>
<p>eat healthy and do the right things um</p>
<p>many times it&rsquo;s going to be benign the</p>
<p>majority of time is going to be benign</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to freak out too bad</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>um so stay tuned for a video on more</p>
<p>details very good we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Michael our last person in the green</p>
<p>room but first let&rsquo;s kick out another</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right true or false E coli okay</p>
<p>creates B vitamins okay and helps you</p>
<p>break down lactose milk sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true or false</p>
<p>all right climb on that and Michael</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>thanks can you hear me okay yes thanks</p>
<p>for having me on so I&rsquo;m an audio nerd</p>
<p>and uh self-made home engineer I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do too much but uh I do have tinnitus</p>
<p>and I want to give everybody a pro tip</p>
<p>about that method where you cup your</p>
<p>ears and flick the base of your skull</p>
<p>add one of these to the base of your</p>
<p>skull don&rsquo;t know what brand it is but it</p>
<p>works wonders way better than the</p>
<p>fingers so I&rsquo;m one of those people that</p>
<p>still uses cotton swabs and I know I</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t but a couple of weeks ago I</p>
<p>ended up digging a little bit too hard</p>
<p>and I think I may have caused a little</p>
<p>bit of damage to the membrane in my ear</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a little bit concerned about it</p>
<p>so I do have an appointment with an ENT</p>
<p>and of course that takes a couple of</p>
<p>weeks and you I just want to know how do</p>
<p>I nurse that and appropriately do it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard earplugs and a little bit of</p>
<p>petroleum jelly but what should I do</p>
<p>yeah um yeah they&rsquo;ll be able to look and</p>
<p>see if there&rsquo;s any damage I think if it</p>
<p>was ruptured you would know it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably just irritated and it could be</p>
<p>just um you know just going to take some</p>
<p>time to heal and sometimes when you have</p>
<p>inner ear damage it it could take some</p>
<p>weeks to actually heal depending on how</p>
<p>much uh bruising or irritation there is</p>
<p>um I would I wouldn&rsquo;t add too many</p>
<p>things into the ear</p>
<p>um you have a normal layer of Flora so</p>
<p>you want that you know that protects</p>
<p>things so you start taking that out too</p>
<p>hard and then all of a sudden now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>susceptible to getting infections and</p>
<p>stuff like that also there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>eustachian tube a hole in the back of</p>
<p>your throat that goes in the back of the</p>
<p>ear</p>
<p>um and um a lot of times if you have</p>
<p>sinus issues uh that you can you can</p>
<p>create more irritation but I think what</p>
<p>I would do if I were you is I just kind</p>
<p>of leave it alone right now and just and</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s in there but</p>
<p>um you know there are people that um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve done some damage to the</p>
<p>ear</p>
<p>um and they have a reincurrent microbial</p>
<p>imbalances and stuff like that and in</p>
<p>that case what they do is they take um</p>
<p>just a diluted</p>
<p>um bit of kimchi juice just they dilute</p>
<p>that a little bit and they just put a</p>
<p>couple drops in there to get the Flora</p>
<p>back going because that&rsquo;s they have</p>
<p>microbes that are really good for</p>
<p>the sinuses as well as the inner ear but</p>
<p>you have a whole inner microbial life</p>
<p>form in there that&rsquo;s protecting you and</p>
<p>things like that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m not doing cotton swabs because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop what should I do to</p>
<p>normally get the earwax out there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different there&rsquo;s different uh</p>
<p>gentle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>washes their different fluids of I think</p>
<p>one would be sailing without any</p>
<p>chemicals that you can gently kind of</p>
<p>flush out the ear</p>
<p>um but also</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s totally okay to take a</p>
<p>cotton squab and just go superficially</p>
<p>just very gently in that area I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine the problem is when people</p>
<p>go too deep or they go too hard and they</p>
<p>start you know just like you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like if they clean your face you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scrubbing too hard you&rsquo;re just like and</p>
<p>then you end up with all sorts of issues</p>
<p>so I think if you&rsquo;re just gentle gentle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be fine but that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>tip on that um that massager that you</p>
<p>have in the back of the neck I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to uh</p>
<p>um update a video on that because that</p>
<p>probably gives you a lot of uh quick</p>
<p>stimulation in the back of the occiput</p>
<p>especially right after Loud Music and</p>
<p>concert yeah right exactly</p>
<p>all right that sounds great well thank</p>
<p>you so much Michael and thanks for</p>
<p>hanging in with us as our last I</p>
<p>responded from The Green Room and that</p>
<p>was a great question uh and I hope that</p>
<p>that helps you out we&rsquo;ve got answers</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got answers the latest one true</p>
<p>false E coli creates vitamins and helps</p>
<p>you break down lactose</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh 55 say it&rsquo;s true and 45 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false doc how are they doing we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>much against uh this E coli because uh</p>
<p>people are freaked out about it but you</p>
<p>know that we have a quite a bit of E</p>
<p>coli that naturally is in our guts uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in animal guts and basically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s friendly</p>
<p>um it makes bevadas B1 B2 B6 B12 and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s when the environment changes</p>
<p>that becomes pathogenic</p>
<p>so it can morph over into an unhealthy</p>
<p>strain but if you&rsquo;re growing food on</p>
<p>good soils and or eating animals that</p>
<p>have not had antibiotics which</p>
<p>can then change the environment and</p>
<p>cause these unhealthy strains then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be fine so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s interesting yeah E coli is a</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s not normally unfriendly until</p>
<p>you piss it off so take care of your</p>
<p>guts don&rsquo;t upset them and uh antibiotics</p>
<p>are the biggest culprit and</p>
<p>unfortunately like 80 percent of the</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>are used in animal feeds and things like</p>
<p>that or Adam For Animals agricultural so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re getting it</p>
<p>indirectly then we get these all</p>
<p>resistant strains that you can&rsquo;t kill</p>
<p>anymore so it&rsquo;s a problem all right very</p>
<p>good we&rsquo;re going to go to Barbara from</p>
<p>YouTube and answer her question after we</p>
<p>put up the last question interested to</p>
<p>hear the answer to this one</p>
<p>what is the only sugar that won&rsquo;t spike</p>
<p>your blood sugars and I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about sugar alcohols or artificial</p>
<p>sweeteners and talking about sugar like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the only one that will not</p>
<p>increase your blood sugars how about</p>
<p>that one I&rsquo;m dying to know the answer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure our audience is too</p>
<p>research hard okay we promised to go to</p>
<p>Barber from YouTube and here we go I</p>
<p>have a problem with acid reflux and it</p>
<p>even triggers by a glass of water it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>triggered by a glass of water what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with poor Barbara</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well I think that um</p>
<p>I think what I would do is I would um</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>well like when you eat for example just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t drink any water because I you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna maybe dilute the acid and that can</p>
<p>actually create more acid reflux and I</p>
<p>think your valve your valve on the top</p>
<p>of the stomach is not closing because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have enough acid and it sounds</p>
<p>logical because you think wow I have too</p>
<p>much acid I need to alkalize my stomach</p>
<p>and then it always gets worse so</p>
<p>um what I would recommend is um watch my</p>
<p>videos in heartburn and acid reflux and</p>
<p>you actually take betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>the only time you wouldn&rsquo;t is if you</p>
<p>took if you had something like um</p>
<p>like gastritis or an ulcer and I talk</p>
<p>about what to do for that but typically</p>
<p>um the way you correct it is by taking</p>
<p>this butane hydrochloride reestablishing</p>
<p>the hydrochloric acid so the top of the</p>
<p>valve can close and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and those symptoms will go away</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t definitely don&rsquo;t drink for</p>
<p>your situation don&rsquo;t drink water or</p>
<p>liquids like right around the meal</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah all right very good and that begs</p>
<p>that we asked the question from</p>
<p>Christine uh what&rsquo;s the best way to</p>
<p>treat Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus that&rsquo;s a nasty</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>same thing same thing you wanted to take</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is we have</p>
<p>not just acid coming up into the</p>
<p>esophagus we have the um</p>
<p>enzymes okay they&rsquo;re really powerful</p>
<p>protein enzymes like protease enzyme</p>
<p>that comes up there that starts</p>
<p>digesting your own protein your</p>
<p>esophagus the cartilage in there so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about keeping that valve shut and</p>
<p>tight</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some of the problem can also be a lack</p>
<p>of B1</p>
<p>because B1</p>
<p>helps make acid because uh of the vagus</p>
<p>nerve and the acetylcholine that control</p>
<p>and then you also have um</p>
<p>just the acid itself just from what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve eaten in the past so watch my</p>
<p>most recent video on digestion where I</p>
<p>talk about taking more B1 to actually</p>
<p>help this acid problem and it can even</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>uh the valves from from an angle of the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system innervation</p>
<p>there so there&rsquo;s things that you can do</p>
<p>naturally</p>
<p>well audience I&rsquo;m really in your debt</p>
<p>because I would probably have been</p>
<p>written up uh if I because I started the</p>
<p>quizzes too late but we&rsquo;ve gotten to all</p>
<p>of them and the last one asked what is</p>
<p>the only sugar that won&rsquo;t spike your</p>
<p>blood sugar and I&rsquo;m rooting for your</p>
<p>audience of which 45 say Stevia 15 say</p>
<p>monk fruit sugar 10 percent say natural</p>
<p>sugars found in fruits oops and</p>
<p>vegetables 10 say honey wow ten percent</p>
<p>say erythritol which you said don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>and 10 say coconut sugar</p>
<p>okay so we&rsquo;ll answer this next month on</p>
<p>the uh no I&rsquo;m just kidding</p>
<p>um now the answer is fructose now hear</p>
<p>me out</p>
<p>um when you check your blood sugar right</p>
<p>you ever notice</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re checking the blood glucose</p>
<p>level</p>
<p>not the blood fructose level</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s glucose so when you consume</p>
<p>fructose it doesn&rsquo;t automatically just</p>
<p>turn into glucose so it doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>um show up in the blood it gets absorbed</p>
<p>and then goes to the liver but some of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s undigested it&rsquo;s slower</p>
<p>um but here&rsquo;s the catch-22</p>
<p>fructose is uh very low on the glycemic</p>
<p>index compared to glucose so fructose is</p>
<p>very low which it won&rsquo;t spike your blood</p>
<p>sugar and so they at first thought hey</p>
<p>this is great we&rsquo;re going to give it to</p>
<p>diabetics and we can sell it at the</p>
<p>grocery store and people will buy it as</p>
<p>a sweetener and then they found out</p>
<p>um whoops that&rsquo;s a big mistake because</p>
<p>the liver is like the only organ that</p>
<p>can ask it is forced to deal with this</p>
<p>sugar and it quickly very quickly</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start building up glycogen and</p>
<p>then convert to Fat triglycerides really</p>
<p>fat really fat fast and then that</p>
<p>creates insulin resistance so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to create more of a problem with</p>
<p>your blood sugars indirectly than just</p>
<p>raising your blood sugar</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s actually worse than glucose if</p>
<p>you have it and especially in the high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>um but some of the sugar</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s in Fruit</p>
<p>um kind of passes on into the intestine</p>
<p>and and starts feeding the microbes and</p>
<p>boy do they like that and so they just</p>
<p>go crazy and you start getting all sorts</p>
<p>of gas and this is why a lot of times</p>
<p>when people eat fruit they gas out too</p>
<p>much because you&rsquo;re feeding these</p>
<p>microbes and they&rsquo;re just loving it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thanking you for it but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>always a good thing so um</p>
<p>that would is the only sugar and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>recommending it</p>
<p>all right very good uh but you did</p>
<p>recommend that those cool uh who</p>
<p>crackers and we&rsquo;re getting several</p>
<p>comments from that asking won&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>cassava flower disrupt ketosis</p>
<p>so cassava flour</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a type of it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>small amounts of it it&rsquo;s out of all the</p>
<p>different flowers</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s probably the a a good one to</p>
<p>take compared to everything else okay in</p>
<p>a cracker and also um it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>considered a resistant starch</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s definitely gonna be fine in</p>
<p>small small amounts compared to</p>
<p>everything else you know the tapioca the</p>
<p>potato</p>
<p>um so I don&rsquo;t recommend consuming</p>
<p>cassava in large amounts but if you if</p>
<p>you take a look at all the ingredients</p>
<p>out there that they&rsquo;re using now with</p>
<p>these so-called keto snacks especially</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using dextrose they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>corn soluble</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>starch and</p>
<p>corn fiber and soy and all this stuff</p>
<p>cassava would be something that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>better than these other ones so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why I recommend and also</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no grains I mean there&rsquo;s no also</p>
<p>um that darn hidden maltodextrin which</p>
<p>is all synthetic</p>
<p>so these are things that are a lot of</p>
<p>the new fibers now that they&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>in all these keto things are untested</p>
<p>long term and so I think what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find is that um</p>
<p>like oh we shouldn&rsquo;t have recommended</p>
<p>this because it creates a lot of bowel</p>
<p>problems and digestive issues and blah</p>
<p>blah blah sorry just just like for</p>
<p>example Steve you know how many years</p>
<p>have doctors recommended like an aspirin</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>for uh</p>
<p>if you have heart problems a long time</p>
<p>yeah now they&rsquo;re saying the even there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a study about the AMA they said that uh</p>
<p>well you know we found that it actually</p>
<p>does not increase</p>
<p>the outcomes that we thought I mean all</p>
<p>these years and then they find out that</p>
<p>wow maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t recommend it this</p>
<p>is happening so much with so many</p>
<p>different things</p>
<p>after a while you know your trust goes</p>
<p>down in some of these recommendations so</p>
<p>um you want to stick with something that</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>that stood the test of time okay very</p>
<p>good I know we&rsquo;re running out of time</p>
<p>but we have an emergency Dr Burke Daniel</p>
<p>from Facebook has had non-stop hiccups</p>
<p>for three days now he&rsquo;s got to be sick</p>
<p>of that any any recommendations for poor</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
<p>well I did a video on this</p>
<p>um you know you you</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a bit of a autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system glitch in the circuitry</p>
<p>um you know I&rsquo;m sure you try to drink a</p>
<p>glass water upside down but I would take</p>
<p>some B1 get some B1 and start taking</p>
<p>that immediately to stop it and also I</p>
<p>would do things to support the</p>
<p>gallbladder because sometimes you could</p>
<p>have some congestion in the gallbladder</p>
<p>and that could be irritating uh the</p>
<p>neurological reflex that&rsquo;s occurring so</p>
<p>you may even want to try look up my</p>
<p>video on gallbladder flushing and</p>
<p>manually massage the gallbladder and the</p>
<p>even the pancreas underneath your</p>
<p>stomach to create more space in there it</p>
<p>could be congested I had one lady that</p>
<p>came in my clinic and she she had</p>
<p>chronic burping for the entire year and</p>
<p>it happened after she did this</p>
<p>um protein powder a low fat protein</p>
<p>powder mix that the weight loss doctor</p>
<p>gave her who by the way who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obese and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a if you go to a dentist and</p>
<p>they have their have a rotten teeth</p>
<p>um you might want to think twice but um</p>
<p>so it was a gallbladder it got just</p>
<p>completely messed with the gallbladder</p>
<p>and she had this burping thing so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would recommend if I were you</p>
<p>all righty well guess what time it is</p>
<p>Doc yes well I appreciate all the</p>
<p>wonderful questions and the comments and</p>
<p>the attention I read the comments and uh</p>
<p>stay tuned for some more in more data</p>
<p>more knowledge so have a great weekend</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you next week</p>
<p>foreign</p>
