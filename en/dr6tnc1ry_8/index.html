this is for beginners what are we trying to do we&amp;rsquo;re trying to switch what your body is running on as far as fuel-wise so we want to switch from burning sugar fuel to fat fuel there&amp;rsquo;s this one hormone called insulin which is the key to determine whether you&amp;rsquo;re going to burn fat or burn sugar so you want to keep it low to burn fat when it goes higher your body will burn sugar very simply lower your carbs and eat less meals that&amp;rsquo;s different than lowering your calories now by eating less meals you are going to lower your calories but that&amp;rsquo;s not the goal you could actually eat larger meals just not as frequent why is it a good idea to eat less frequent meals because every time you eat you trigger insulin every time you eat carbs you trigger insulin so we&amp;rsquo;re just trying to lower this insulin the combination between these two are very very powerful so what are you going to eat in a meal well first thing you have to eat low carb so you want to cut down all your carbs that includes sugar and i&amp;rsquo;m talking about honey agave nectar brown sugar white sugar date sugar all sugar you can replace it in various recipes with what&amp;rsquo;s called sugar alcohols i put some links down below of examples of that so you can learn about that but there&amp;rsquo;s these sweet alternative sugar sources that you can use so that means that when you go buy food you have to start reading the labels and looking at the sugar content you want it as close to zero as possible you want to avoid fruit except for berries there&amp;rsquo;s three berries raspberries strawberries and blackberries you can have those in small amounts but no other fruit especially apples grains like wheat flour that they make breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits you want to avoid that but guess what there&amp;rsquo;s a substitute there&amp;rsquo;s a people use almond flour to make all sorts of things from pizza crust to bread to you name it so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of recipes that you can use as an alternative grain avoid starches like potatoes but guess what there&amp;rsquo;s all these recipes that you can make out of cauliflower that is very similar to the starches not identical but you can make things that are very close to tasting like mashed potatoes you can even make a cauliflower crust for your pizza it&amp;rsquo;s quite good now when i say cut out all the carbs there&amp;rsquo;s an exception vegetables in fact you want to consume more vegetables at least seven cups you know even more that could be salads or other types of vegetables like bell peppers like cabbage like broccoli kale brussels sprouts and at this level that i&amp;rsquo;m teaching you you can even do carrots and tomatoes beets don&amp;rsquo;t worry about that you can have those and the last point about vegetables is that ideally if you eat them first it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot easier to consume seven cups than after you have the protein and fat because this is going to fill you up pretty fast so i always consume the vegetable first now you can consume it at the same time but just as a strategy to make sure you get enough vegetables in your diet i like to consume these first because very few people consume enough vegetables and one last point vegetables provide two things they provide food for your microbes that then help your blood sugars and help give you energy also they provide a lot of nutrients like potassium and magnesium and even vitamin c because what are we trying to do we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do keto correctly and by correctly i mean healthily okay number two moderate protein not massive amounts like in the atkins diet but moderate amounts that could be depending on your size and your metabolism and your age between three and eight ounces maybe you&amp;rsquo;re 18 years old and you work out hardcore you&amp;rsquo;re gonna need maybe more protein so rather than have a little scale and measure it just consume protein the size of the palm of your hand maybe a little bit more a little less okay just to kind of keep it really simple at this level what type of protein different types of meat fish chicken seafood eggs cheese unless you have an allergy or any type of severe gut issue nuts or nut butters also make sure that you if you buy peanut butter or whatever you read the ingredients to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have added sugar you don&amp;rsquo;t want to add sugar to any of these because sometimes when you have like deli meats they have dextrose in there or extra sugar if you&amp;rsquo;re having bacon they have extra sugar added you preferably keep the sugar away from your protein all right with the protein as far as the order of when you eat it you just ate your vegetable your salad now you start with your protein the key with the protein is not to consume lean protein or low fat protein try to consume protein that has more fat why because that&amp;rsquo;s going to help your insulin levels when you consume protein that&amp;rsquo;s very low fat and lean as in like powders especially like whey protein powder you majorly increase insulin versus consuming fattier meat or fattier fish or like brie cheese which is has more fat so that&amp;rsquo;s a really key point about protein all right the third thing is that you&amp;rsquo;re on a higher fat diet now when we talk about higher fats mainly we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the calories there&amp;rsquo;s more than twice as many calories in fat than there is protein in carbs so based on calories it would be a higher fat diet so i&amp;rsquo;m not going to say anything more to confuse you on that point but realize that when you&amp;rsquo;re consuming the protein guess what you&amp;rsquo;re consuming a lot of the fat in your diet already because protein always comes with fat but you may add some additional fats let&amp;rsquo;s say some avocado butter to cook your food in or let&amp;rsquo;s say you melt the butter on your vegetables which is a good idea because the veggies have certain fat soluble natural chemicals in there that are good for you even antioxidants they&amp;rsquo;re called phytonutrients and adding oil to your salad whether it&amp;rsquo;s olive oil or butter over your vegetables will help you extract those nutrients out of that meal that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s good to combine these things right here olives or olive oil is very very good coconut oil is actually also pretty good and of course some of these are in the fat category like nuts for example or half fat and half protein a little bit of carb cheese is protein and fat eggs are protein and fat so a lot of these are fat too so both of these are kind of a combination but if you&amp;rsquo;re starting keto a lot of times people add maybe some nuts or cheese after the meal to be more satisfied so that&amp;rsquo;s something that they do and so that&amp;rsquo;s why i said eat this third but of course it could be within the meal now there&amp;rsquo;s certain fats you definitely want to avoid soy oil corn oil canola oil cottonseed oil even the safflower oil the sunflower oil i would be careful about consuming too much of those these are gmo they have chemicals in them but the problem is they&amp;rsquo;re highly inflammatory even though it&amp;rsquo;s a fat it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong type of fat that you want in your body and you probably see these in salad dressings and many different products like mayonnaise in there so you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to kind of start reading labels and really get picky on certain things that you&amp;rsquo;re going to be buying so we talked about generally what to eat but we also want to talk about eating less meals right less frequent meals we&amp;rsquo;re going to do intermittent fasting we&amp;rsquo;re going to combine both of these together to really take that insulin and bring it down to our normal level so here&amp;rsquo;s the rule of thumb don&amp;rsquo;t eat unless you are hungry now let me define hungry because sometimes you might get a little bit of hunger but you still feel strong uh you still feel fine your mood is good we&amp;rsquo;ll try to push through that okay there&amp;rsquo;s also a difference between hunger and also like a habit people have like a habit of eating all the time even when they&amp;rsquo;re not hungry because they feel that they&amp;rsquo;re not as full as maybe they should be so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be full all the time we&amp;rsquo;re talking about hungry and a true hunger is like wow i feel like i really need to eat i feel a little bit weaker i feel a little shaky i&amp;rsquo;m starting to notice i&amp;rsquo;m a little bit more irritable okay that is what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about not some little temporary hunger number two ideally you want to skip the breakfast you can do this on a gradual level where you keep pushing your breakfast later and later and later or just cut it right out and just skip breakfast instead have your coffee with a little butter in it a tablespoon of butter and or mct oil which will help you greatly in making ketones which is very therapeutic to your brain and it&amp;rsquo;ll satisfy you so as you&amp;rsquo;re trying to transition into the state of ketosis which you&amp;rsquo;re burning fat because ketones are a byproduct of burning fat if you add mct oil that will give you ketones right away and it&amp;rsquo;ll make the transition a little more comfortable especially with your cognitive function so this is a good idea and if you did this coffee with this these two fats it&amp;rsquo;s going to be very easy to skip breakfast also i want to note that about 8 am in the morning is when you have this hormonal shift with cortisol might go up and you may find a temporary about a half hour kind of a a sense like i i&amp;rsquo;m ready to eat something it&amp;rsquo;s the cortisol it&amp;rsquo;s a hormonal shift and it can increase your appetite just ignore that and push through that okay so we&amp;rsquo;re skipping our breakfast at this point number three very importantly do not snack through the day that little snack even though it&amp;rsquo;s low amount of calories will make you hungry eating stimulates hunger especially if it&amp;rsquo;s in the form of a snack so just cut out all snacking it&amp;rsquo;s very very important if you get the temptation the snack just realize that you didn&amp;rsquo;t consume enough fat at the last meal so the next meal add more fat to the diet so you can go easily from one meal to the next so it&amp;rsquo;s important to add more fat to go longer there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of details to fill in the blank but typically you can drink water tea coffee anything without sugar you can take your vitamins it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be a problem and again there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of details that i&amp;rsquo;m not covering but i&amp;rsquo;m just giving you the basics so let&amp;rsquo;s say your first meal is at noon okay you eat your meal don&amp;rsquo;t really worry at this point about calories because we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to reduce calories all we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do is have that first meal make sure it fits what i said in the last slide and then the second meal at six so that gives you a six hour eating window and 18-hour fast okay if you don&amp;rsquo;t snack which is huge this is going to allow you to see a lot of benefits with this program so that is the summary of how to do keto correctly before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help'>

insulin levels when you consume protein that&amp;rsquo;s very low fat and lean as in like powders especially like whey protein powder you majorly increase insulin versus consuming fattier meat or fattier fish or like brie cheese which is has more fat so that&amp;rsquo;s a really key point about protein all right the third thing is that you&amp;rsquo;re on a higher fat diet now when we talk about higher fats mainly we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the calories there&amp;rsquo;s more than twice as many calories in fat than there is protein in carbs so based on calories it would be a higher fat diet so i&amp;rsquo;m not going to say anything more to confuse you on that point but realize that when you&amp;rsquo;re consuming the protein guess what you&amp;rsquo;re consuming a lot of the fat in your diet already because protein always comes with fat but you may add some additional fats let&amp;rsquo;s say some avocado butter to cook your food in or let&amp;rsquo;s say you melt the butter on your vegetables which is a good idea because the veggies have certain fat soluble natural chemicals in there that are good for you even antioxidants they&amp;rsquo;re called phytonutrients and adding oil to your salad whether it&amp;rsquo;s olive oil or butter over your vegetables will help you extract those nutrients out of that meal that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s good to combine these things right here olives or olive oil is very very good coconut oil is actually also pretty good and of course some of these are in the fat category like nuts for example or half fat and half protein a little bit of carb cheese is protein and fat eggs are protein and fat so a lot of these are fat too so both of these are kind of a combination but if you&amp;rsquo;re starting keto a lot of times people add maybe some nuts or cheese after the meal to be more satisfied so that&amp;rsquo;s something that they do and so that&amp;rsquo;s why i said eat this third but of course it could be within the meal now there&amp;rsquo;s certain fats you definitely want to avoid soy oil corn oil canola oil cottonseed oil even the safflower oil the sunflower oil i would be careful about consuming too much of those these are gmo they have chemicals in them but the problem is they&amp;rsquo;re highly inflammatory even though it&amp;rsquo;s a fat it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong type of fat that you want in your body and you probably see these in salad dressings and many different products like mayonnaise in there so you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to kind of start reading labels and really get picky on certain things that you&amp;rsquo;re going to be buying so we talked about generally what to eat but we also want to talk about eating less meals right less frequent meals we&amp;rsquo;re going to do intermittent fasting we&amp;rsquo;re going to combine both of these together to really take that insulin and bring it down to our normal level so here&amp;rsquo;s the rule of thumb don&amp;rsquo;t eat unless you are hungry now let me define hungry because sometimes you might get a little bit of hunger but you still feel strong uh you still feel fine your mood is good we&amp;rsquo;ll try to push through that okay there&amp;rsquo;s also a difference between hunger and also like a habit people have like a habit of eating all the time even when they&amp;rsquo;re not hungry because they feel that they&amp;rsquo;re not as full as maybe they should be so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be full all the time we&amp;rsquo;re talking about hungry and a true hunger is like wow i feel like i really need to eat i feel a little bit weaker i feel a little shaky i&amp;rsquo;m starting to notice i&amp;rsquo;m a little bit more irritable okay that is what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about not some little temporary hunger number two ideally you want to skip the breakfast you can do this on a gradual level where you keep pushing your breakfast later and later and later or just cut it right out and just skip breakfast instead have your coffee with a little butter in it a tablespoon of butter and or mct oil which will help you greatly in making ketones which is very therapeutic to your brain and it&amp;rsquo;ll satisfy you so as you&amp;rsquo;re trying to transition into the state of ketosis which you&amp;rsquo;re burning fat because ketones are a byproduct of burning fat if you add mct oil that will give you ketones right away and it&amp;rsquo;ll make the transition a little more comfortable especially with your cognitive function so this is a good idea and if you did this coffee with this these two fats it&amp;rsquo;s going to be very easy to skip breakfast also i want to note that about 8 am in the morning is when you have this hormonal shift with cortisol might go up and you may find a temporary about a half hour kind of a a sense like i i&amp;rsquo;m ready to eat something it&amp;rsquo;s the cortisol it&amp;rsquo;s a hormonal shift and it can increase your appetite just ignore that and push through that okay so we&amp;rsquo;re skipping our breakfast at this point number three very importantly do not snack through the day that little snack even though it&amp;rsquo;s low amount of calories will make you hungry eating stimulates hunger especially if it&amp;rsquo;s in the form of a snack so just cut out all snacking it&amp;rsquo;s very very important if you get the temptation the snack just realize that you didn&amp;rsquo;t consume enough fat at the last meal so the next meal add more fat to the diet so you can go easily from one meal to the next so it&amp;rsquo;s important to add more fat to go longer there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of details to fill in the blank but typically you can drink water tea coffee anything without sugar you can take your vitamins it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be a problem and again there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of details that i&amp;rsquo;m not covering but i&amp;rsquo;m just giving you the basics so let&amp;rsquo;s say your first meal is at noon okay you eat your meal don&amp;rsquo;t really worry at this point about calories because we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to reduce calories all we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do is have that first meal make sure it fits what i said in the last slide and then the second meal at six so that gives you a six hour eating window and 18-hour fast okay if you don&amp;rsquo;t snack which is huge this is going to allow you to see a lot of benefits with this program so that is the summary of how to do keto correctly before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help">

<p>﻿welcome today we&rsquo;re going to show you how to 
start keto correctly and this is for beginners  </p>
<p>what are we trying to do we&rsquo;re trying to switch 
what your body is running on as far as fuel-wise  </p>
<p>so we want to switch from burning sugar fuel to 
fat fuel there&rsquo;s this one hormone called insulin  </p>
<p>which is the key to determine whether you&rsquo;re going 
to burn fat or burn sugar so you want to keep it  </p>
<p>low to burn fat when it goes higher your body 
will burn sugar very simply lower your carbs  </p>
<p>and eat less meals that&rsquo;s different than 
lowering your calories now by eating less meals  </p>
<p>you are going to lower your calories but that&rsquo;s 
not the goal you could actually eat larger meals  </p>
<p>just not as frequent why is it a good idea to 
eat less frequent meals because every time you  </p>
<p>eat you trigger insulin every time you eat carbs 
you trigger insulin so we&rsquo;re just trying to lower  </p>
<p>this insulin the combination between these two 
are very very powerful so what are you going to  </p>
<p>eat in a meal well first thing you have to eat 
low carb so you want to cut down all your carbs  </p>
<p>that includes sugar and i&rsquo;m talking about honey 
agave nectar brown sugar white sugar date sugar  </p>
<p>all sugar you can replace it in various 
recipes with what&rsquo;s called sugar alcohols  </p>
<p>i put some links down below of examples of 
that so you can learn about that but there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>these sweet alternative sugar sources that 
you can use so that means that when you go  </p>
<p>buy food you have to start reading the labels 
and looking at the sugar content you want it  </p>
<p>as close to zero as possible you want to 
avoid fruit except for berries there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>three berries raspberries strawberries and 
blackberries you can have those in small amounts  </p>
<p>but no other fruit especially apples grains like 
wheat flour that they make breads pasta cereal  </p>
<p>crackers biscuits you want to avoid that but 
guess what there&rsquo;s a substitute there&rsquo;s a people  </p>
<p>use almond flour to make all sorts of things from 
pizza crust to bread to you name it so there&rsquo;s a  </p>
<p>lot of recipes that you can use as an alternative 
grain avoid starches like potatoes but guess what  </p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these recipes that you can make out of 
cauliflower that is very similar to the starches  </p>
<p>not identical but you can make things that are 
very close to tasting like mashed potatoes you can  </p>
<p>even make a cauliflower crust for your pizza it&rsquo;s 
quite good now when i say cut out all the carbs  </p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an exception vegetables in fact you want 
to consume more vegetables at least seven cups you  </p>
<p>know even more that could be salads or other types 
of vegetables like bell peppers like cabbage like  </p>
<p>broccoli kale brussels sprouts and at this level 
that i&rsquo;m teaching you you can even do carrots and  </p>
<p>tomatoes beets don&rsquo;t worry about that you can have 
those and the last point about vegetables is that  </p>
<p>ideally if you eat them first it&rsquo;s going to be a 
lot easier to consume seven cups than after you  </p>
<p>have the protein and fat because this is going to 
fill you up pretty fast so i always consume the  </p>
<p>vegetable first now you can consume it at the same 
time but just as a strategy to make sure you get  </p>
<p>enough vegetables in your diet i like to consume 
these first because very few people consume enough  </p>
<p>vegetables and one last point vegetables provide 
two things they provide food for your microbes  </p>
<p>that then help your blood sugars and help give you 
energy also they provide a lot of nutrients like  </p>
<p>potassium and magnesium and even vitamin c because 
what are we trying to do we&rsquo;re trying to do keto  </p>
<p>correctly and by correctly i mean healthily okay 
number two moderate protein not massive amounts  </p>
<p>like in the atkins diet but moderate amounts 
that could be depending on your size and  </p>
<p>your metabolism and your age between three and 
eight ounces maybe you&rsquo;re 18 years old and you  </p>
<p>work out hardcore you&rsquo;re gonna need maybe more 
protein so rather than have a little scale and  </p>
<p>measure it just consume protein the size of the 
palm of your hand maybe a little bit more a little  </p>
<p>less okay just to kind of keep it really simple at 
this level what type of protein different types of  </p>
<p>meat fish chicken seafood eggs cheese unless you 
have an allergy or any type of severe gut issue  </p>
<p>nuts or nut butters also make sure that 
you if you buy peanut butter or whatever  </p>
<p>you read the ingredients to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t 
have added sugar you don&rsquo;t want to add sugar to  </p>
<p>any of these because sometimes when you have 
like deli meats they have dextrose in there or  </p>
<p>extra sugar if you&rsquo;re having bacon 
they have extra sugar added you  </p>
<p>preferably keep the sugar away from your protein 
all right with the protein as far as the order of  </p>
<p>when you eat it you just ate your vegetable 
your salad now you start with your protein  </p>
<p>the key with the protein is not to consume lean 
protein or low fat protein try to consume protein  </p>
<p>that has more fat why because that&rsquo;s going 
to help your insulin levels when you consume  </p>
<p>protein that&rsquo;s very low fat and lean as in like 
powders especially like whey protein powder  </p>
<p>you majorly increase insulin versus consuming 
fattier meat or fattier fish or like brie cheese  </p>
<p>which is has more fat so that&rsquo;s a really key 
point about protein all right the third thing  </p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re on a higher fat diet now when we 
talk about higher fats mainly we&rsquo;re talking about  </p>
<p>the calories there&rsquo;s more than twice as many 
calories in fat than there is protein in carbs  </p>
<p>so based on calories it would be a higher fat diet 
so i&rsquo;m not going to say anything more to confuse  </p>
<p>you on that point but realize that when you&rsquo;re 
consuming the protein guess what you&rsquo;re consuming  </p>
<p>a lot of the fat in your diet already because 
protein always comes with fat but you may add  </p>
<p>some additional fats let&rsquo;s say some avocado 
butter to cook your food in or let&rsquo;s say you  </p>
<p>melt the butter on your vegetables which is a good 
idea because the veggies have certain fat soluble  </p>
<p>natural chemicals in there that are good for you 
even antioxidants they&rsquo;re called phytonutrients  </p>
<p>and adding oil to your salad whether it&rsquo;s 
olive oil or butter over your vegetables  </p>
<p>will help you extract those nutrients out of that 
meal that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to combine these things  </p>
<p>right here olives or olive oil is very very good 
coconut oil is actually also pretty good and of  </p>
<p>course some of these are in the fat category like 
nuts for example or half fat and half protein  </p>
<p>a little bit of carb cheese is protein and fat 
eggs are protein and fat so a lot of these are fat  </p>
<p>too so both of these are kind of a combination but 
if you&rsquo;re starting keto a lot of times people add  </p>
<p>maybe some nuts or cheese after the meal to be 
more satisfied so that&rsquo;s something that they do  </p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why i said eat this third but of 
course it could be within the meal now there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>certain fats you definitely want to avoid 
soy oil corn oil canola oil cottonseed oil  </p>
<p>even the safflower oil the sunflower oil i would 
be careful about consuming too much of those  </p>
<p>these are gmo they have chemicals in them but 
the problem is they&rsquo;re highly inflammatory even  </p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s a fat it&rsquo;s the wrong type of fat that 
you want in your body and you probably see these  </p>
<p>in salad dressings and many different products 
like mayonnaise in there so you&rsquo;re going to have  </p>
<p>to kind of start reading labels and really get 
picky on certain things that you&rsquo;re going to be  </p>
<p>buying so we talked about generally what to 
eat but we also want to talk about eating less  </p>
<p>meals right less frequent meals we&rsquo;re going 
to do intermittent fasting we&rsquo;re going to  </p>
<p>combine both of these together to really take that 
insulin and bring it down to our normal level so  </p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the rule of thumb don&rsquo;t eat unless 
you are hungry now let me define hungry  </p>
<p>because sometimes you might get a little 
bit of hunger but you still feel strong  </p>
<p>uh you still feel fine your mood is good we&rsquo;ll 
try to push through that okay there&rsquo;s also a  </p>
<p>difference between hunger and also like a habit 
people have like a habit of eating all the time  </p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re not hungry because they feel 
that they&rsquo;re not as full as maybe they should be  </p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to be full all the time we&rsquo;re 
talking about hungry and a true hunger is like wow  </p>
<p>i feel like i really need to eat i feel a little 
bit weaker i feel a little shaky i&rsquo;m starting  </p>
<p>to notice i&rsquo;m a little bit more irritable okay 
that is what we&rsquo;re talking about not some little  </p>
<p>temporary hunger number two ideally you want 
to skip the breakfast you can do this on a  </p>
<p>gradual level where you keep pushing your 
breakfast later and later and later or just  </p>
<p>cut it right out and just skip breakfast instead 
have your coffee with a little butter in it a  </p>
<p>tablespoon of butter and or mct oil which will 
help you greatly in making ketones which is very  </p>
<p>therapeutic to your brain and it&rsquo;ll satisfy you so 
as you&rsquo;re trying to transition into the state of  </p>
<p>ketosis which you&rsquo;re burning fat because ketones 
are a byproduct of burning fat if you add mct oil  </p>
<p>that will give you ketones right away and it&rsquo;ll 
make the transition a little more comfortable  </p>
<p>especially with your cognitive function so this is 
a good idea and if you did this coffee with this  </p>
<p>these two fats it&rsquo;s going to be very easy to 
skip breakfast also i want to note that about  </p>
<p>8 am in the morning is when you have this 
hormonal shift with cortisol might go up and  </p>
<p>you may find a temporary about a half hour kind 
of a a sense like i i&rsquo;m ready to eat something  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the cortisol it&rsquo;s a hormonal shift and it can 
increase your appetite just ignore that and push  </p>
<p>through that okay so we&rsquo;re skipping our breakfast 
at this point number three very importantly do not  </p>
<p>snack through the day that little snack 
even though it&rsquo;s low amount of calories  </p>
<p>will make you hungry eating stimulates hunger 
especially if it&rsquo;s in the form of a snack  </p>
<p>so just cut out all snacking it&rsquo;s very very 
important if you get the temptation the snack  </p>
<p>just realize that you didn&rsquo;t consume enough fat 
at the last meal so the next meal add more fat  </p>
<p>to the diet so you can go easily from one 
meal to the next so it&rsquo;s important to add  </p>
<p>more fat to go longer there&rsquo;s a lot of details 
to fill in the blank but typically you can drink  </p>
<p>water tea coffee anything without sugar you can 
take your vitamins it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem  </p>
<p>and again there&rsquo;s a lot of details that i&rsquo;m 
not covering but i&rsquo;m just giving you the basics  </p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say your first meal is at noon okay 
you eat your meal don&rsquo;t really worry at this  </p>
<p>point about calories because we&rsquo;re not trying to 
reduce calories all we&rsquo;re trying to do is have  </p>
<p>that first meal make sure it fits what i said 
in the last slide and then the second meal at  </p>
<p>six so that gives you a six hour eating window 
and 18-hour fast okay if you don&rsquo;t snack  </p>
<p>which is huge this is going to allow you to see 
a lot of benefits with this program so that is  </p>
<p>the summary of how to do keto correctly before 
you go if you have a question about a product  </p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know 
how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you  </p>
<p>need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth i 
have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p>
<p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p>
<p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p>
