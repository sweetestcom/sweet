today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about um what was that uh god what was that oh yeah short-term memory loss now this can relate to the beginnings of dementia all the way over to alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s so the symptom of memory loss has everything to do with the hippocampus and the greek term for hippocampus means seahorse because that&amp;rsquo;s the shape and you have two of them one on the left side one on the right side so that way if one goes you have a backup so related to short-term memory loss i have some good news and some bad news the bad news is that as you age the hippocampus actually starts to shrink okay so age is definitely one thing you&amp;rsquo;re up against so you just have to stay as young as possible number two if you decrease oxygen you can destroy the hippocampus number three stress will definitely affect the hippocampus it&amp;rsquo;ll actually make it atrophy and shrink the more stress you go through the more you can have atrophy or shrinkage of your hippocampus i mean it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy nowadays to avoid stress right all right number four high glucose diabetics are at risk for having damage to their hippocampus so high carb diets are not very good for the hippocampus at all number five a vitamin b1 deficiency so vitamin b1 is i would say the second most important nutrient for the hippocampus i put some links down below for more information about b1 because you want to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting enough b1 from the diet to make sure that you can preserve the hippocampus now number six a vitamin d deficiency out of all the areas of your brain a vitamin d deficiency will affect the hippocampus the most so it&amp;rsquo;s a very good thing that vitamin d deficiency is very rare nowadays or else we&amp;rsquo;d be in big trouble now that was a sarcasm because a vitamin d deficiency is extremely common among most of the population on planet earth and number seven if you have a zinc deficiency that can majorly affect the ability of your hippocampus to function resulting in short-term memory loss okay so that&amp;rsquo;s the bad news what is the good news now the good news is the hippocampus is one of the only areas of the brain that can completely regenerate thank goodness for that so if we just go ahead and look at the list we have to stay as young as possible number one we want to increase oxygen to our hippocampus exercise is one of the best ways to do it another way would be to use the hyperbaric oxygen therapy but overall you want to keep your oxygen at a very high level now the next thing would be fasting fasting including intermittent fasting is a very powerful therapy to increase something called bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor and so by doing fasting you increase that compound which directly increases neurogenesis which is the creation of new nerve tissue all right next one is to start taking vitamin d as i said before vitamin d is the most important nutrient for your hippocampus and also start consuming food high in zinc that would be all the shellfish also beef liver has a good amount of zinc in it and taking more b1 is very very vital i would recommend taking nutritional yeast on a regular basis and the last thing i want to mention is to decrease your stress as much as possible do whatever you can to do that and of course applying these other things is also going to reduce stress especially if you do regular consistent exercise the type of exercise that will increase more oxygen long walks would be a really good thing now the next thing is increasing your ketones ketones are the preferred fuel of the brain especially the hippocampus in fact you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to regenerate the hippocampus without feeding it ketones and there&amp;rsquo;s several ways of increasing ketones number one getting in a low-carb diet of course you probably already know that if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel i put some links down below of exactly what diet you need to be on number two consuming mct oil very very important medium chain triglyceride fats will turn into ketones and your brain will actually absorb them in preference to glucose and you&amp;rsquo;ll see huge benefits you can also take exogenous ketones they&amp;rsquo;re called ketone salts and that will also increase your ketones they&amp;rsquo;re a bit expensive so it might be cheaper to take the mct oil but more important than mct oil in exogenous ketones is getting on a ketogenic diet keeping your carbs low and that&amp;rsquo;s going to be very very important in restoring the hippocampus all right guys there you have it those are the key things to help you with short-term memory before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some

to talk about um what was that uh  </p><p>god what was that oh yeah short-term memory loss 
now this can relate to the beginnings of dementia  </p><p>all the way over to alzheimer&rsquo;s so the symptom 
of memory loss has everything to do with the  </p><p>hippocampus and the greek term for hippocampus 
means seahorse because that&rsquo;s the shape  </p><p>and you have two of them one on the left side 
one on the right side so that way if one goes  </p><p>you have a backup so related to short-term 
memory loss i have some good news and some  </p><p>bad news the bad news is that as you age the 
hippocampus actually starts to shrink okay so  </p><p>age is definitely one thing you&rsquo;re up against so 
you just have to stay as young as possible number  </p><p>two if you decrease oxygen you can destroy the 
hippocampus number three stress will definitely  </p><p>affect the hippocampus it&rsquo;ll actually make it 
atrophy and shrink the more stress you go through  </p><p>the more you can have atrophy or shrinkage 
of your hippocampus i mean it&rsquo;s pretty easy  </p><p>nowadays to avoid stress right all right number 
four high glucose diabetics are at risk for having  </p><p>damage to their hippocampus so high carb diets 
are not very good for the hippocampus at all  </p><p>number five a vitamin b1 deficiency so vitamin b1 
is i would say the second most important nutrient  </p><p>for the hippocampus i put some links down 
below for more information about b1 because  </p><p>you want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough b1 
from the diet to make sure that you can preserve  </p><p>the hippocampus now number six a vitamin d 
deficiency out of all the areas of your brain  </p><p>a vitamin d deficiency will affect the 
hippocampus the most so it&rsquo;s a very good  </p><p>thing that vitamin d deficiency is very rare 
nowadays or else we&rsquo;d be in big trouble now that  </p><p>was a sarcasm because a vitamin d deficiency is 
extremely common among most of the population on  </p><p>planet earth and number seven if you have a zinc 
deficiency that can majorly affect the ability  </p><p>of your hippocampus to function resulting in 
short-term memory loss okay so that&rsquo;s the bad news  </p><p>what is the good news now the good news is the 
hippocampus is one of the only areas of the brain  </p><p>that can completely regenerate thank goodness for 
that so if we just go ahead and look at the list  </p><p>we have to stay as young as possible number one 
we want to increase oxygen to our hippocampus  </p><p>exercise is one of the best ways to do it another 
way would be to use the hyperbaric oxygen therapy  </p><p>but overall you want to keep your oxygen at a very 
high level now the next thing would be fasting  </p><p>fasting including intermittent fasting is a very 
powerful therapy to increase something called  </p><p>bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor and so 
by doing fasting you increase that compound  </p><p>which directly increases neurogenesis which is the 
creation of new nerve tissue all right next one  </p><p>is to start taking vitamin d as i said before 
vitamin d is the most important nutrient for  </p><p>your hippocampus and also start consuming food 
high in zinc that would be all the shellfish  </p><p>also beef liver has a good amount of zinc 
in it and taking more b1 is very very vital  </p><p>i would recommend taking nutritional yeast on a 
regular basis and the last thing i want to mention  </p><p>is to decrease your stress as much as possible do 
whatever you can to do that and of course applying  </p><p>these other things is also going to reduce stress 
especially if you do regular consistent exercise  </p><p>the type of exercise that will increase more 
oxygen long walks would be a really good thing  </p><p>now the next thing is increasing your ketones 
ketones are the preferred fuel of the brain  </p><p>especially the hippocampus in fact you&rsquo;re not 
going to be able to regenerate the hippocampus  </p><p>without feeding it ketones and there&rsquo;s several 
ways of increasing ketones number one getting  </p><p>in a low-carb diet of course you probably 
already know that if you&rsquo;re new to my channel  </p><p>i put some links down below of exactly what diet 
you need to be on number two consuming mct oil  </p><p>very very important medium chain triglyceride 
fats will turn into ketones and your brain will  </p><p>actually absorb them in preference to glucose 
and you&rsquo;ll see huge benefits you can also  </p><p>take exogenous ketones they&rsquo;re called ketone 
salts and that will also increase your ketones  </p><p>they&rsquo;re a bit expensive so it might be cheaper 
to take the mct oil but more important than mct  </p><p>oil in exogenous ketones is getting on a ketogenic 
diet keeping your carbs low and that&rsquo;s going to be  </p><p>very very important in restoring the hippocampus 
all right guys there you have it those are the  </p><p>key things to help you with short-term memory 
before you go if you have a question about a  </p><p>product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to 
know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and  </p><p>you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth 
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
