about what would happen if you stopped eating fast food for one week now i want to go beyond just carbohydrates and sugar i&amp;rsquo;ve done so many videos on that if you stop eating carbs and sugar we know all the benefits that are going to occur i&amp;rsquo;ll put some links down below if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that video because i mean you&amp;rsquo;re going to help prevent a fatty liver you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose a lot of weight you&amp;rsquo;re going to have cognitive changes all sorts of wonderful things just for the fact that you cut down your carbs and your sugars but what else is in fast food that if you eliminate it would benefit you well number one when you eat processed foods refined foods you are eating foods very low in nutrients anytime you eat empty calories or foods that are void in nutrition you end up depleting your reserves of vitamins and minerals specifically b1 calcium zinc other b vitamins and that creates a whole series of issues right there also when you consume empty calories or refined foods you don&amp;rsquo;t get any phytonutrients so you have a situation where you have no antioxidants and a lot of oxidation and you have a lot of damage in the body just from oxidation alone from free radical damage because these phytonutrients protect i mean so many things your heart the inside layer of your arteries the kidneys the eyes the brain the nerves so without those phytonutrients or antioxidants you tend to get things like peripheral neuropathy where you get tingling and burning in your toes you start to have vision problems kidney problems heart issues and the list goes on and on but there&amp;rsquo;s something else i want to talk about there are a lot of food additives in fast food preservatives colorings things that enhance the texture of the food the thickness of certain sauces and things you have sweeteners you have artificial sweeteners but the one that i want to focus on now is things that enhance the flavors okay and primarily i&amp;rsquo;m talking about msg monosodium glutamate also known as modified food starch which is in so many foods so why are they putting a flavor enhancer in food in the first place what are they trying to cover up if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have msg in this fast food what would it really taste like you probably would be shocked you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t eat it and as far as the topic of msg if you do research on it you&amp;rsquo;re going to find very wide viewpoints some people say it&amp;rsquo;s good some people say it&amp;rsquo;s bad and so you have this conflicting viewpoint you don&amp;rsquo;t know who to believe because you&amp;rsquo;ll see research on both sides my whole thought on that is that unless you really have first-hand knowledge and you experiment with it yourself or on close friends that you know and you can see the results um you don&amp;rsquo;t really know for sure however that being said um just from being in practice for 30 years i have found that whatever the general consensuses of the mainstream thought i tend to look in the opposite direction and i don&amp;rsquo;t trust that viewpoint because there&amp;rsquo;s so much vested interest involved and so i tend to go in the other direction but what i will tell you about msg from personal observation i don&amp;rsquo;t get the reactions that the allergies the sensitivities but what i get is incredible pleasure it tastes good initially but then about an hour and a half later i am starving so i know for a fact through personal firsthand observation that it increases hunger and it will cause me to keep eating especially when you go to a thai restaurant or a chinese restaurant or just see like doritos for example which in college i lived on doritos and a lot of other junk foods so i have a lot of experience in this area and i also know it retains fluid because when i consume that food i&amp;rsquo;m so thirsty and then i end up finding that i can&amp;rsquo;t even get my ring off or my ankles get puffy now currently i don&amp;rsquo;t do any msg i&amp;rsquo;m talking about in my early 20s when i had a lot of experience in doing junk foods and so here&amp;rsquo;s my viewpoint if you were to cut out fast food for one week you&amp;rsquo;re gonna notice your hunger goes away you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to go from one meal to the next much easier especially if you&amp;rsquo;re doing keto in intermittent fasting you&amp;rsquo;re going to notice your cravings are going to drop which then makes it very easy to stick to a plan also your fluid retention will greatly improve you&amp;rsquo;ll get rid of a lot of fluid you you&amp;rsquo;ll probably pee a lot more for about two weeks you&amp;rsquo;re going to find your mind is clear your cognitive function is much better you&amp;rsquo;re going to feel like your body is overall cleaner you&amp;rsquo;re not going to feel so groggy you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get the brain fog you&amp;rsquo;re going to have definitely more energy and then you&amp;rsquo;ll start losing fat actual fat but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen right away that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit delayed one or two weeks and so if you eat a lot of fast food and by the way back then no one could have convinced me not to do fast foods i was highly addicted i had to hit bottom before i changed but maybe you are different and a bit wiser so try to give up fast food just for one week to prove it to yourself so you can have first-hand knowledge that it will very much benefit you in many different levels hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up

eating fast food for one week now i want to go  </p><p>beyond just carbohydrates and sugar i&rsquo;ve done so 
many videos on that if you stop eating carbs and  </p><p>sugar we know all the benefits that are going 
to occur i&rsquo;ll put some links down below if you  </p><p>haven&rsquo;t seen that video because i mean you&rsquo;re 
going to help prevent a fatty liver you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to lose a lot of weight you&rsquo;re going to have 
cognitive changes all sorts of wonderful things  </p><p>just for the fact that you cut down your carbs and 
your sugars but what else is in fast food that if  </p><p>you eliminate it would benefit you well number 
one when you eat processed foods refined foods  </p><p>you are eating foods very low in nutrients anytime 
you eat empty calories or foods that are void in  </p><p>nutrition you end up depleting your reserves of 
vitamins and minerals specifically b1 calcium  </p><p>zinc other b vitamins and that creates a whole 
series of issues right there also when you consume  </p><p>empty calories or refined foods you don&rsquo;t get 
any phytonutrients so you have a situation where  </p><p>you have no antioxidants and a lot of oxidation 
and you have a lot of damage in the body just  </p><p>from oxidation alone from free radical damage 
because these phytonutrients protect i mean  </p><p>so many things your heart the inside layer 
of your arteries the kidneys the eyes  </p><p>the brain the nerves so without those 
phytonutrients or antioxidants you tend to get  </p><p>things like peripheral neuropathy where you get 
tingling and burning in your toes you start to  </p><p>have vision problems kidney problems heart issues 
and the list goes on and on but there&rsquo;s something  </p><p>else i want to talk about there are a lot of food 
additives in fast food preservatives colorings  </p><p>things that enhance the texture of the food the 
thickness of certain sauces and things you have  </p><p>sweeteners you have artificial sweeteners but the 
one that i want to focus on now is things that  </p><p>enhance the flavors okay and primarily i&rsquo;m talking 
about msg monosodium glutamate also known as  </p><p>modified food starch which is in so many foods 
so why are they putting a flavor enhancer in  </p><p>food in the first place what are they trying to 
cover up if you didn&rsquo;t have msg in this fast food  </p><p>what would it really taste like you probably 
would be shocked you probably wouldn&rsquo;t eat it  </p><p>and as far as the topic of msg if you do research 
on it you&rsquo;re going to find very wide viewpoints  </p><p>some people say it&rsquo;s good some people say it&rsquo;s 
bad and so you have this conflicting viewpoint  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t know who to believe because you&rsquo;ll see 
research on both sides my whole thought on that is  </p><p>that unless you really have first-hand knowledge 
and you experiment with it yourself or on  </p><p>close friends that you know and you can see the 
results um you don&rsquo;t really know for sure however  </p><p>that being said um just from being in practice 
for 30 years i have found that whatever  </p><p>the general consensuses of the mainstream thought 
i tend to look in the opposite direction and  </p><p>i don&rsquo;t trust that viewpoint because there&rsquo;s so 
much vested interest involved and so i tend to go  </p><p>in the other direction but what i will tell you 
about msg from personal observation i don&rsquo;t get  </p><p>the reactions that the allergies the sensitivities 
but what i get is incredible pleasure it tastes  </p><p>good initially but then about an hour and a 
half later i am starving so i know for a fact  </p><p>through personal firsthand observation that it 
increases hunger and it will cause me to keep  </p><p>eating especially when you go to a thai 
restaurant or a chinese restaurant or just see  </p><p>like doritos for example which in college i lived 
on doritos and a lot of other junk foods so i have  </p><p>a lot of experience in this area and i also know 
it retains fluid because when i consume that food  </p><p>i&rsquo;m so thirsty and then i end up finding that i 
can&rsquo;t even get my ring off or my ankles get puffy  </p><p>now currently i don&rsquo;t do any msg i&rsquo;m talking about 
in my early 20s when i had a lot of experience in  </p><p>doing junk foods and so here&rsquo;s my viewpoint 
if you were to cut out fast food for one week  </p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna notice your hunger goes away 
you&rsquo;ll be able to go from one meal to the  </p><p>next much easier especially if you&rsquo;re doing keto 
in intermittent fasting you&rsquo;re going to notice  </p><p>your cravings are going to drop which then makes 
it very easy to stick to a plan also your fluid  </p><p>retention will greatly improve you&rsquo;ll get rid of 
a lot of fluid you you&rsquo;ll probably pee a lot more  </p><p>for about two weeks you&rsquo;re going to find your mind 
is clear your cognitive function is much better  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to feel like your body is overall 
cleaner you&rsquo;re not going to feel so groggy you&rsquo;re  </p><p>not going to get the brain fog you&rsquo;re going to 
have definitely more energy and then you&rsquo;ll start  </p><p>losing fat actual fat but that doesn&rsquo;t happen 
right away that&rsquo;s a little bit delayed one or two  </p><p>weeks and so if you eat a lot of fast food and by 
the way back then no one could have convinced me  </p><p>not to do fast foods i was highly addicted i had 
to hit bottom before i changed but maybe you are  </p><p>different and a bit wiser so try to give up fast 
food just for one week to prove it to yourself so  </p><p>you can have first-hand knowledge that it will 
very much benefit you in many different levels  </p><p>hey before you go real quick i have a course 
entitled how to bulletproof your immune system  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and 
here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment  </p><p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p><p>what about strengthening your immune system 
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p><p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p><p>by strengthening your own immune system i put 
a link down in the description right down below  </p><p>check it out and get signed up today</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
