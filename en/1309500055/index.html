    <p>hi guys how are you today my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>sanaaaa sanaaaa</p>
<p>if you are new here hi my name is Bailey</p>
<p>and every Monday I sit down I talk about a true</p>
<p>crime story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>so if you are interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup I</p>
<p>would highly suggest you subscribe you know</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s October and things are kind of</p>
<p>spooky ooky out there I thought it&rsquo;d be nice to kind of</p>
<p>throw in throwing it in you can either</p>
<p>catch it or you could</p>
<p>dodge it a little bit of a ghost story</p>
<p>whether you believe in</p>
<p>ghosts or not that&rsquo;s up to you baby</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just gonna share this one</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get into today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story about Ali and Debbie Tolman</p>
<p>so this story takes place in</p>
<p>February of 1987</p>
<p>Alan and Debbie Tallman and their</p>
<p>3 children moved into a new home in Horricon Wisconsin</p>
<p>let me double</p>
<p>check that is it Horikon</p>
<p>I have a feeling it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s Hurricane</p>
<p>Wisconsin now at this time it was a very</p>
<p>small farming community and there was like</p>
<p>under 3 000 people who live there</p>
<p>I forgot to check what it is now but it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>still small I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>so they have 3 children</p>
<p>2 little girls and they are</p>
<p>about 3 years old and then they have a little boy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s about 7</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their kids be named at all they wanted to keep them</p>
<p>them anonymous</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>be referring to them as like the children and whatnot</p>
<p>the family moves</p>
<p>into this new home and Debbie described</p>
<p>this home as being her</p>
<p>dream home I mean</p>
<p>everything she</p>
<p>could want or</p>
<p>could have wanted for her family</p>
<p>it was the perfect</p>
<p>3 bedroom suburban home</p>
<p>the house needed</p>
<p>a little bit of fixing up you know some like</p>
<p>painted walls</p>
<p>maybe some new carpet eventually</p>
<p>but for the most part they</p>
<p>could move in</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>now upon moving in</p>
<p>Debbie kind of took notice</p>
<p>that her kids seemed to be getting sick</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>now kids get sick a</p>
<p>lot because they&rsquo;re constantly around germs and whatnot</p>
<p>little rascals</p>
<p>she just thought it was strange because the kids</p>
<p>rarely got sick</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t figure out why they were getting the flu</p>
<p>back to back</p>
<p>to back I mean</p>
<p>she says that the kids were just</p>
<p>constantly sick</p>
<p>Debbie would take the kids</p>
<p>to the doctors</p>
<p>and they would have a fever</p>
<p>they would get some</p>
<p>medication they&rsquo;d be fine and then again</p>
<p>they would all get sick and it was just strange but</p>
<p>Debbie and Alan just assumed</p>
<p>it was I don&rsquo;t know stress from the new</p>
<p>place the weather changing</p>
<p>so the 2 youngest</p>
<p>daughters would be sharing a room</p>
<p>together and then they have</p>
<p>their younger son who</p>
<p>would have his own room</p>
<p>and then the parents obviously have</p>
<p>their room Debbie decided to go to a</p>
<p>local thrift</p>
<p>store because she wanted to see if she could find</p>
<p>like bunk beds for the daughters</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;d be perfect she comes across</p>
<p>a bunk bed that was in perfect</p>
<p>brand new condition</p>
<p>and it would be</p>
<p>great for the younger girls bunk beds</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t like bunk beds</p>
<p>did you know</p>
<p>that there are currently over</p>
<p>24 million podcasts in the world</p>
<p>including the one that you&rsquo;re listening to</p>
<p>right this minute</p>
<p>guess what it takes a whole team of people</p>
<p>to help bring</p>
<p>these podcasts together</p>
<p>with murder mystery makeup I have</p>

<p>so once the bunk beds were brought back to the home</p>
<p>they assembled it</p>
<p>and they set it up in the bedroom</p>
<p>voila it was perfect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s May of 1987</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>night all the kids are finally</p>
<p>sleeping in their own</p>
<p>rooms Alan the father was in his son&rsquo;s room saying good</p>
<p>night to his son in his bedroom like tucked him in at</p>
<p>night and his son</p>
<p>tells Alan his father can you turn on the</p>
<p>radio for me because I like</p>
<p>sleeping with the</p>
<p>radio on he likes that noise</p>
<p>Alan turns on the radio</p>
<p>kisses his son good night</p>
<p>turns off the lights</p>
<p>and goes to his room so his son</p>
<p>is in bed and he turns over and he hears that the</p>
<p>radio changes channels</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those radios that has the dial</p>
<p>to find the channel</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t really know how to</p>
<p>find his way back to the correct</p>
<p>channel it was on so he gets up out of bed</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>to his parents room and he&rsquo;s like can you come fix the</p>
<p>radio for me it turned channels so Alan gets up out of</p>
<p>bed and he goes back to his son&rsquo;s room and he adjusts</p>
<p>the radio for him</p>
<p>Alan just goes back to bed</p>
<p>few minutes</p>
<p>later the sun is in his room</p>
<p>right and he&rsquo;s just like trying to sleep</p>
<p>this time he sees the</p>
<p>radio dial was</p>
<p>turning on its own</p>
<p>like it was just turning</p>
<p>stations obviously it</p>
<p>freaks him out so he</p>
<p>screams and he goes back into his parents room</p>
<p>terrified he just saw</p>
<p>a radio dial turning on its own</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to explain</p>
<p>to his parents like I saw the dial moving on its own</p>
<p>can I sleep in here please</p>
<p>and at this point Alan</p>
<p>is a little bit</p>
<p>upset because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>sleep Alan even</p>
<p>says in an interview that he got pretty like</p>
<p>upset with the</p>
<p>sun told him to go back to his room so Alan unplugs the</p>
<p>radio he takes it from</p>
<p>his son&rsquo;s room and is like no now you don&rsquo;t get this</p>
<p>radio because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making stories up</p>
<p>and I just need to go to bed so let&rsquo;s just take it out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>now he doesn&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>radio and now he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>trouble for</p>
<p>something that happened and no one believes him</p>
<p>so summer now turns into winter</p>
<p>and by this</p>
<p>time the family is just not doing well they were all</p>
<p>really struggling</p>
<p>to get like a good night</p>
<p>sleep either</p>
<p>nightmares would wake</p>
<p>somebody up like the children</p>
<p>would wake up</p>
<p>because they had a nightmare or even the parents</p>
<p>Alan and Debbie</p>
<p>they said that</p>
<p>they were like having just really strange</p>
<p>dreams and then some</p>
<p>nights they</p>
<p>would hear noises</p>
<p>just like cranking noises</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>could easily be dismissed</p>
<p>like it could be the wind that was causing that</p>
<p>noise nightmares</p>
<p>are happening because of stress</p>
<p>and it really wasn&rsquo;t anything for them to</p>
<p>fully worry</p>
<p>about because</p>
<p>again it was just</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>could brush off now Debbie said</p>
<p>sometimes in the middle of the</p>
<p>night she would hear the 2 youngest girls in</p>
<p>their room it</p>
<p>sounded like they were giggling</p>
<p>they were laughing</p>
<p>they were playing</p>
<p>but it was like 2 am</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like what the hell</p>
<p>are they doing up and Debbie</p>
<p>would go into the room she</p>
<p>would see that all the kids were asleep</p>
<p>no one was up nobody was playing</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>I must be losing my mind I don&rsquo;t know what is happening</p>
<p>so a few weeks</p>
<p>later Allen</p>
<p>is down in the basement area because he decided he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give the basement a little makeover</p>
<p>well first of all it needed to be</p>
<p>painted because it was just grimy looking</p>
<p>and he wanted to turn it into like his man cave</p>
<p>so alan&rsquo;s like okay I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna be down here I&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>painting so Debbie comes downstairs and she tells Alan</p>
<p>hey lunch is</p>
<p>ready let&rsquo;s go have it together as family</p>
<p>so Alan is like okay cool and he puts his</p>
<p>paintbrush down</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>right back when he&rsquo;s done having lunch</p>
<p>and finish the job</p>
<p>he sets his</p>
<p>paintbrush on the</p>
<p>table making sure that the bristles are kind of</p>
<p>like hanging off of the edge Alan goes upstairs he has</p>
<p>lunch with the fam</p>
<p>and once he&rsquo;s done he comes back downstairs</p>
<p>he sees that the</p>
<p>paintbrush is now</p>
<p>sticking into the</p>
<p>paint container itself the</p>
<p>brush is in there and it&rsquo;s just kind of</p>
<p>standing straight up</p>
<p>alan&rsquo;s thinking like</p>
<p>I know for a fact that I set the</p>
<p>brush down on the edge of the</p>
<p>table and everybody was upstairs having</p>
<p>lunch so who the fuck</p>
<p>move the brush</p>
<p>into the pink container now Alan</p>
<p>is just one of</p>
<p>those old school dads</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s just like a logical dad he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>going on in this</p>
<p>house it&rsquo;s me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>losing my mind I must have placed it in the bowl</p>
<p>in the container</p>
<p>and I just forgot</p>
<p>about it or something</p>
<p>Ellen didn&rsquo;t want to believe that there was like</p>
<p>ghosts or anything but deep down he knew that this is</p>
<p>weird suspicious</p>
<p>that night once</p>
<p>again one of the girls</p>
<p>sleeping in the bunk beds began</p>
<p>screaming in the middle of the</p>
<p>night Debbie and Allen</p>
<p>they both ran into the bedroom because it was just like</p>
<p>an intense scream</p>
<p>not a normal</p>
<p>scream but like a</p>
<p>scream Debbie and Allen they run to the bedroom to find</p>
<p>their daughter just</p>
<p>screaming and crying</p>
<p>and they ask you know what&rsquo;s happening what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>claimed that there was a</p>
<p>witch in her bedroom uh huh</p>
<p>a witch okay</p>
<p>and the daughter said that this witch</p>
<p>was watching them</p>
<p>she was by the door</p>
<p>and she had red eyes</p>
<p>and she liked to hide</p>
<p>behind the bedroom door when the parents were around</p>
<p>she goes on with saying that the</p>
<p>witch had set her room on fire</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why she was</p>
<p>screaming cause she was</p>
<p>trapped in this fire</p>
<p>they kind of told her the</p>
<p>daughter you know it&rsquo;s just a nightmare</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s fine you&rsquo;re safe there&rsquo;s no fire</p>
<p>just go back to bed</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s okay then</p>
<p>their son comes rushing into the room</p>
<p>cause he heard the</p>
<p>screaming as well</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>to his parents I saw the same</p>
<p>thing she&rsquo;s an old lady</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s watching us</p>
<p>and she keeps setting</p>
<p>things on fire</p>
<p>now Debbie is the one who</p>
<p>starts believing her kids I mean she feels like</p>
<p>there is something weird</p>
<p>going on around the</p>
<p>house obviously she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna mention this in</p>
<p>front of the children</p>
<p>but Debbie is taking what her kids are saying seriously</p>
<p>like fuck I hate this house</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s giving me the</p>
<p>creeps I just don&rsquo;t feel safe here</p>
<p>now as the days went on</p>
<p>the family would be having dinner</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would just hear doors kind of creek open</p>
<p>they would hear</p>
<p>a door slam shut</p>
<p>and just really like</p>
<p>weird noises just continued</p>
<p>which if I was hearing this</p>
<p>stuff I would just run out of the house</p>
<p>slamming shut no mm hmm</p>
<p>but they stayed I mean yep they stayed</p>
<p>anyways and then when Debbie was doing her laundry</p>
<p>or just doing laundry in general she</p>
<p>heard strange</p>
<p>voices calling</p>
<p>out to her either calling her name or saying</p>
<p>like come here</p>
<p>come here no no</p>
<p>no no and Debbie</p>
<p>would tell Alan</p>
<p>about this he was just like you guys</p>
<p>stop it then at that same</p>
<p>night that Debbie</p>
<p>heard these weird</p>
<p>voices calling out to her</p>
<p>their son woke up in the middle of</p>
<p>night screaming</p>
<p>and when Debbie or Allen went in to</p>
<p>check on him he</p>
<p>claimed that he saw like a dark</p>
<p>cloud by the</p>
<p>door of his room whatever it was like it was</p>
<p>watching him and it was telling him that they were</p>
<p>going to kill his family</p>
<p>so then a week before Christmas</p>
<p>they got the Christmas tree all set up supposed to be a</p>
<p>happy time and</p>
<p>their son is out</p>
<p>sleeping on the</p>
<p>couch because he wanted to</p>
<p>sleep next to the Christmas tree and like all the</p>
<p>lights and stuff</p>
<p>but really I</p>
<p>think he just didn&rsquo;t want to sleep</p>
<p>in his bedroom anymore</p>
<p>so the sun is</p>
<p>sleeping out on the</p>
<p>couch in the living room and he opens his eyes and he</p>
<p>starts screaming again</p>
<p>because he sees an</p>
<p>older woman</p>
<p>and she was evil</p>
<p>and she had</p>
<p>these red eyes and she wanted to hurt the family</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>going to set the</p>
<p>house on fire</p>
<p>this is what she&rsquo;s telling the little boy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>screaming for his parents</p>
<p>and his mom comes running in and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>begging and crying to his mom</p>
<p>like please can we</p>
<p>leave can we get out of here</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know how you say no to that</p>

<p>now at this</p>
<p>point Alan has just grown</p>
<p>sick of this shit okay he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tired of it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not sleeping</p>
<p>everybody is just like</p>
<p>freaking out over nothing and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>sick of it all so alan&rsquo;s like you know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tell this ghost</p>
<p>to go F itself pretty much</p>
<p>so he Alan just has like all this</p>
<p>anger that&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>building up and then he explodes</p>
<p>and he starts just</p>
<p>screaming at the top of his lungs at</p>
<p>these spirits</p>
<p>to get the hell out of his</p>
<p>house they were</p>
<p>not welcome here and then he goes on to say what you</p>
<p>should never do</p>
<p>leave the kids</p>
<p>alone and if you</p>
<p>wanna fight somebody</p>
<p>come fight me</p>
<p>mother ever</p>
<p>come on you coward</p>
<p>whether you believe in</p>
<p>ghosts and not</p>
<p>or not that&rsquo;s up to you if you&rsquo;re new to</p>
<p>ghosts you should</p>
<p>never challenge them</p>
<p>okay actually I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re supposed to acknowledge them really</p>
<p>cause as soon as you acknowledge them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just game over</p>
<p>which this is a side note I did that</p>
<p>I was not really</p>
<p>fully a believer in</p>
<p>ghosts ever</p>
<p>it was kind of like yeah it</p>
<p>could be true</p>
<p>but at the same</p>
<p>time I don&rsquo;t want to know if it is or isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I just kind of like let it be</p>
<p>and then once we</p>
<p>moved out here to Los Angeles the last</p>
<p>place we lived at</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>experienced it I</p>
<p>swear to you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to be like no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s X Y and Z</p>
<p>that are causing</p>
<p>these issues but once you</p>
<p>experience it it&rsquo;s so it sucks</p>
<p>these damn spirits and</p>
<p>and I tried to be nice and offer a lipstick to my</p>
<p>ghost in the house and</p>
<p>apparently that was not very good</p>
<p>and everybody says that like oh Youtubers always have</p>
<p>ghosts in their house</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s because a lot of Youtubers</p>
<p>live out here in Los Angeles and Los Angeles is a very</p>
<p>very old city</p>
<p>I mean people have</p>
<p>lived and died here for a very long time</p>
<p>like the old</p>
<p>apartment we</p>
<p>lived in was</p>
<p>built in 1920</p>
<p>so the next</p>
<p>today Debbie and Allen decided to contact</p>
<p>their pastor</p>
<p>who then came over to the house</p>
<p>to check it out you know to see like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something evil in the home</p>
<p>and this pastor said as soon as he walked into the home</p>
<p>he felt a presence of evil</p>
<p>and he wanted to help because he</p>
<p>could see that the family</p>
<p>whatever this presence is is using like</p>
<p>energy from your children</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s like getting sick all the time</p>
<p>cause the kids were</p>
<p>still getting sick</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>wanted to help the family so he comes over and he</p>
<p>blesses the</p>
<p>house telling</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s in that home that it needs to leave</p>
<p>cause that always works</p>
<p>so 3 weeks later around 2 AM on January 7th 1988</p>
<p>this is when Allen returns home</p>
<p>from work pulls up into his</p>
<p>driveway right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s late at</p>
<p>night he&rsquo;s working the</p>
<p>night shift so he gets home at</p>
<p>about 2 a m</p>
<p>He gets out of his car and then he</p>
<p>starts walking towards the</p>
<p>front door and</p>
<p>while walking he hears eerie</p>
<p>howling sound you know that</p>
<p>noise of like a really</p>
<p>heavy wind outside</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hearing that</p>
<p>noise except</p>
<p>there was absolutely no wind</p>
<p>going on it was like a completely</p>
<p>still cold night but no wind was happening so he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what the fuck is that noise you know</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like continuing to walk towards the</p>
<p>front door and he hears a</p>
<p>voice that&rsquo;s coming out of like this howling noise</p>
<p>and this voice is saying come here come here</p>
<p>so Alan went around the back to see if anyone was there</p>
<p>which if you hear someone saying come here and it</p>
<p>sounds like creepy and suspicious</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come here</p>
<p>keep it moving well I</p>
<p>guess he has to he&rsquo;s Dad</p>
<p>dad&rsquo;s have to it&rsquo;s in the rulebook</p>
<p>anyways so he</p>
<p>goes around the back to see like what the hell that is</p>
<p>he sees nobody</p>
<p>so he walks</p>
<p>again around the front</p>
<p>grabbing his keys to unlock the</p>
<p>front door before</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s able to unlock the door he looks over</p>
<p>and the garage is</p>
<p>right there you know</p>
<p>and he sees like this glow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from inside the garage</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like what the hell</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s just a lot of what the hell is</p>
<p>going on so he</p>
<p>kinda moves closer to the garage to go</p>
<p>check it out and he sees oh my God like there&rsquo;s a fire</p>
<p>smoke Alan is just like unlocking the door he had a</p>
<p>lunch bag that he was carrying</p>
<p>he sets that</p>
<p>down he runs inside he grabs the fire extinguisher</p>
<p>and then he runs</p>
<p>back outside to come put out the fire and</p>
<p>when he comes back outside there is no fire the fire</p>
<p>the fire was gone</p>
<p>no fire the garage door was</p>
<p>completely undamaged and it was</p>
<p>clear that there was no</p>
<p>there was no fire like</p>
<p>there was no obvious sign that a fire was happening</p>
<p>so Alan just goes back and he grabs his</p>
<p>lunch pail that he sat down and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>carrying it and he&rsquo;s moving on with his life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when something came up behind him and like</p>
<p>punched or just</p>
<p>threw the lunch pail across the room</p>
<p>and it broke a lamp</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s super easy to sit here</p>
<p>and be like why don&rsquo;t you move out why don&rsquo;t you move</p>
<p>what are you doing but here&rsquo;s the thing kids</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just pick up a move sometimes</p>
<p>that costs money</p>
<p>a lot of money</p>
<p>you see you need this</p>
<p>thing called a deposit</p>
<p>security deposit it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make much</p>
<p>sense because a lot of times you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the security deposit back but it&rsquo;s like you have to pay</p>
<p>double the rent up</p>
<p>front are you</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>break a lease</p>
<p>it just costs</p>
<p>a lot to move you can&rsquo;t just pick up and move and</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>after this incident</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Allen</p>
<p>started sleeping in his</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>he said he was there to protect the youngest kids</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he started</p>
<p>sleeping in their room</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>maybe he was scared</p>
<p>after a few</p>
<p>nights of sleeping in there</p>
<p>Alan said he</p>
<p>would hear something</p>
<p>whispering you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>which like he&rsquo;s not dead so the</p>
<p>ghost is just being lazy with</p>
<p>choice of words</p>
<p>if you wanna be</p>
<p>spooky say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die or something you know anyways</p>
<p>after that everyone</p>
<p>slept in the same room</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame him a few days</p>
<p>later Allen</p>
<p>was working</p>
<p>late and asked his brother to</p>
<p>watch the girls</p>
<p>he wanted a man there to protect</p>
<p>kids Allen got in the habit</p>
<p>of all of them</p>
<p>sleeping together but</p>
<p>since he was working late</p>
<p>and Debbie was</p>
<p>alone Debbie was</p>
<p>gonna sleep with their son</p>
<p>and then the brother</p>
<p>could sleep in the room with the girls</p>
<p>and just make sure you know nothing happens</p>
<p>so it gave Alan</p>
<p>peace of mind knowing that</p>
<p>his brother was there</p>
<p>to watch over everybody</p>
<p>so Demi was</p>
<p>going to sleep with</p>
<p>their son and protect him and then alan&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>would be sleeping in</p>
<p>the bedroom with the girls Alan told his brother look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something weird</p>
<p>going on in the</p>
<p>house we think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ghost or like some shit but I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave my family there</p>
<p>alone Debbie</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like to be</p>
<p>alone so please stay the</p>
<p>night and make sure nothing happens</p>
<p>his brother&rsquo;s like yeah yeah yeah sure</p>
<p>buddy ghosts</p>
<p>sure Alan sure</p>
<p>needless to</p>
<p>say his brother was a non believer here okay</p>
<p>while sleeping with the girls</p>
<p>the brother wakes up because he hears like a loud bang</p>
<p>it scares him it just kind of wakes him up</p>
<p>and when he wakes up he kind</p>
<p>of looks around and he sees a dark figure by the door</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t make out what it was but it was</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>knew it was</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>he screamed and he</p>
<p>grabbed the children and yelled to Debbie</p>
<p>to get the hell out of the</p>
<p>house that they were leaving</p>
<p>right now Debbie</p>
<p>is like oh thank God</p>
<p>because Alan</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>leave but okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re leaving yep Debbie puts like some important</p>
<p>stuff in a little bag some</p>
<p>clothes the</p>
<p>stuff she needs and then they get the hell out of there</p>
<p>they never went back to the home</p>
<p>on that note let me put on my</p>
<p>final look and I&rsquo;ll be right back</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a cat meow</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s finish the</p>
<p>story though</p>
<p>2 weeks later the Tallmans had</p>
<p>the bunk beds destroyed</p>
<p>you see they kind of thought that</p>
<p>maybe the bunk beds had something to do with it</p>
<p>because it seemed like</p>
<p>things really got amped up</p>
<p>once the bunk beds come in</p>
<p>came into the girls room</p>
<p>now the kids were</p>
<p>getting sick and what not before the bunk beds were</p>
<p>there but they thought that it was indeed the bunk beds</p>
<p>we ended up</p>
<p>dropping the bunk beds off</p>
<p>at the dump</p>
<p>place where it</p>
<p>would be destroyed</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want anyone else to go through it</p>
<p>and then afterwards once they</p>
<p>moved out the family</p>
<p>moved to a new</p>
<p>house and everything</p>
<p>they had no further paranormal</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>no more voices</p>
<p>nightmares everybody was</p>
<p>great in April of 1988 a family</p>
<p>moved into the old</p>
<p>tallman&rsquo;s house they</p>
<p>had reported to have no haunting</p>
<p>experiences many</p>
<p>media outlets had</p>
<p>heard about this</p>
<p>story and that there was a</p>
<p>haunting in the family</p>
<p>and at this</p>
<p>house too and many</p>
<p>people came to them asking to</p>
<p>cover the story</p>
<p>and also the</p>
<p>local gossip was happening</p>
<p>about how they were making</p>
<p>it all up for attention that they were just drunks and</p>
<p>that they just wanted</p>
<p>money but the Tallman family</p>
<p>stood by their</p>
<p>experience they also wanted no</p>
<p>media attention</p>
<p>they had turned down a lucrative</p>
<p>tabloid offer</p>
<p>about their</p>
<p>experience they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>right to make any</p>
<p>money off of</p>
<p>their children&rsquo;s</p>
<p>misfortune that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great good for them the Tolmans did</p>
<p>agree to share their</p>
<p>story with Unsolved Mysteries in 1988</p>
<p>under 3 conditions</p>
<p>one they were censored during</p>
<p>their interview</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their faces to be shown 2</p>
<p>their children&rsquo;s names were protected</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want anybody to know who</p>
<p>their kids were</p>
<p>3 reenactments</p>
<p>of their experiences</p>
<p>be done by actors playing the Tallman family</p>
<p>which I thought they did in</p>
<p>every episode but</p>
<p>that was their request</p>
<p>the tallman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>House activity</p>
<p>was described</p>
<p>in a greater extent in a book called</p>
<p>haunted America by Michael Norman</p>
<p>and Best Scott</p>
<p>but at no time in</p>
<p>their research do they link the</p>
<p>hauntings to the bunk bed itself</p>
<p>they believe that the activity</p>
<p>was linked to the property as being located on a</p>
<p>former burial ground</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bad at putting sentences together aren&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>and that is a</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>the Tallman family and the paranormal activity they had</p>
<p>experienced</p>
<p>in their home</p>
<p>a lot of people do not believe</p>
<p>in paranormal activity</p>
<p>but you know I don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>carbon monoxide poisoning is always like the number one</p>
<p>thing that they say is linked to paranormal</p>
<p>activity carbon monoxide poisoning can make you see</p>
<p>things hear things</p>
<p>it starts to make you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy it only</p>
<p>happens in your home if you&rsquo;re having like a leak</p>
<p>and a lot of people confuse that with</p>
<p>ghosts because</p>
<p>I mean the side</p>
<p>effects of carbon monoxide poisoning you hear</p>
<p>things you see things you</p>
<p>start having</p>
<p>nightmares your</p>
<p>chest starts to hurt you</p>
<p>start to feel dizzy</p>
<p>lightheaded</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t smell it you can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to know if you&rsquo;re having a leak</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always the first</p>
<p>thing that people mention</p>
<p>in these types of stories it</p>
<p>could be the case</p>
<p>but who knows anyways let me know your thoughts down</p>
<p>below do you believe in ghosts</p>
<p>thank you so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today meow meow</p>
<p>see I&rsquo;m a great cat I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today make good choices please be safe out there</p>
<p>and if you leave here with only learning one thing</p>
<p>that one thing I&rsquo;m gonna tell you to not do don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>ever ever challenge a ghost</p>
<p>nene and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
