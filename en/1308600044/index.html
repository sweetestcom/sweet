    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samer Hattar</p>
<p>as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Hattar is the chief of the section</p>
<p>on light and circadian rhythms</p>
<p>at the National Institute of Mental Health</p>
<p>in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Dr. Hattar has many important discoveries to his name.</p>
<p>He was one of a handful of groups</p>
<p>that discovered the light-sensing neurons in the eye</p>
<p>that set the circadian clock.</p>
<p>This was a fundamental discovery made in the early 2000s</p>
<p>that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries</p>
<p>on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system,</p>
<p>our mood, mental health, metabolism, feeding,</p>
<p>and many other important processes.</p>
<p>If ever there was somebody who understands</p>
<p>how all of these processes interact</p>
<p>and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Dr. Hattar.</p>
<p>During our discussion today,</p>
<p>Dr. Hattar answers questions</p>
<p>that are absolutely essential for us to know</p>
<p>about our health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>For instance, how to align our sleep schedule</p>
<p>with our activity schedule, such as exercise,</p>
<p>and how to align light, activity, and exercise</p>
<p>with our feeding rhythms.</p>
<p>He presents a new model of how light, activity,</p>
<p>and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health,</p>
<p>and when those are not aligned correctly,</p>
<p>how our mental and physical health can suffer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism,</p>
<p>made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand,</p>
<p>as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts</p>
<p>in day length, shifts in activity,</p>
<p>and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism,</p>
<p>and wellbeing of various kinds.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Samer, as I always do.</p>
<p>He is an absolute wealth of knowledge</p>
<p>on all things related to light and circadian rhythms,</p>
<p>physiology, and neuroscience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find anyone else as knowledgeable</p>
<p>about these topics as Samer,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m delighted that he joined us here on the podcast</p>
<p>to share this information.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentous on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentous</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my conversation with Dr. Samer Hattar.</p>
<p>Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>Yeah, we go way back.</p>
<p>So you are best known in scientific circles</p>
<p>for your work on how light impacts mood,</p>
<p>learning, feeding, hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.</p>
<p>So just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak,</p>
<p>how does light impact the way we feel?</p>
<p>So when I get up in the morning,</p>
<p>I have the opportunity to interact with light</p>
<p>in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways.</p>
<p>I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight</p>
<p>or with artificial light.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just wade us into what the relationship is</p>
<p>between light and these things like mood and hunger,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light</p>
<p>for vision.</p>
<p>So when you wake up in a beautiful area, beautiful ocean,</p>
<p>light is essential.</p>
<p>The sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your conscious perception of light.</p>
<p>But light has a completely different aspect</p>
<p>that is independent of conscious vision</p>
<p>or image forming functions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it regulates many important functions</p>
<p>in your body.</p>
<p>I think the best that is well-studied and well-known</p>
<p>is your circadian clock.</p>
<p>And the word circadian comes from the word circa,</p>
<p>which is approximate and dn is day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an approximate day.</p>
<p>Why is it an approximate day?</p>
<p>Because if I put you or any other human being</p>
<p>who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions</p>
<p>with no information about feeding time, about sleep time,</p>
<p>about what time it is outside,</p>
<p>you still have a daily rhythm,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not exactly 24 hours.</p>
<p>So it will shift out of the solar day</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not exactly 24 hours</p>
<p>and hence the name circadian.</p>
<p>So just to ask a quick question about that,</p>
<p>when you say you have this about 24 hour rhythm,</p>
<p>how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body?</p>
<p>Great, so great question.</p>
<p>So it shows up at every level that we know, we studied.</p>
<p>It shows up at the level of the cell.</p>
<p>It shows up at the level of the tissue</p>
<p>and it shows up at your behavior.</p>
<p>The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>You sleep and you&rsquo;re awake and sleep at the 24 hour rhythms.</p>
<p>And if you measure the sleep-wake cycle of humans</p>
<p>who are maintained in constant conditions,</p>
<p>you will see that the period length</p>
<p>of the sleep rhythm on average is more than 24 hours</p>
<p>and a human&rsquo;s is 24.2 hours.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll be drifting 0.2 hours every day</p>
<p>out of the solar day if you don&rsquo;t get the sunlight.</p>
<p>So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day</p>
<p>to an exact day.</p>
<p>So now your behavior is adjusted</p>
<p>to the light dark environment or the solar day.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>if I were to go into a cave</p>
<p>or I were to be in constant light</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t close my eyes in constant light,</p>
<p>that I would still sleep in one coherent bout</p>
<p>and I would still be awake</p>
<p>for more or less one coherent bout, maybe a nap.</p>
<p>But the total duration of my day, so to speak,</p>
<p>would be a little bit longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m in a condition like most people are</p>
<p>where the sun goes up and the sun goes down</p>
<p>and I have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have the understanding.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have conscious understanding.</p>
<p>You have the detection.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So circadian photoentrainment is the word we use</p>
<p>in training the circadian clock to the photic environment</p>
<p>is completely subconscious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not aware of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like vision or image forming</p>
<p>where you actually know what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all hypothalamic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the brain that is not consciously driven.</p>
<p>So you actually do not know when it happens</p>
<p>or when it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>when I tell you why light affects your mood</p>
<p>and why sometimes people don&rsquo;t know how to deal with light</p>
<p>to improve their mood, for example.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Before you tell us about how light impacts mood,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, what is the relevance of adjusting this clock</p>
<p>from a little bit longer than 24 hours to 24 hours?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like a small difference,</p>
<p>24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the relevance?</p>
<p>I mean, why should we care about that short difference?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do the math.</p>
<p>If you shift out 0.2 hours a day in five days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shifting out one hour.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re literally one hour off</p>
<p>in your social behavior in five days.</p>
<p>In 10 days, you&rsquo;re two hours off.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an organism that is living in the wild,</p>
<p>shifting out of the right phase of the cycle,</p>
<p>you could either miss food or you could become food.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really essential for survival.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the strongest aspect of survival</p>
<p>for animals to have the anticipation</p>
<p>and the adjustment to the solar cycle.</p>
<p>And for humans as well, when you say animals,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that applies to us.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s just a short bit longer than 24,</p>
<p>if that accumulates over days,</p>
<p>then you could find yourself very much out of phase</p>
<p>with the rest of your species, essentially.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 0.2 hours.</p>
<p>So in five days, it&rsquo;s one hour.</p>
<p>In 25 days, it could be five or six hours.</p>
<p>You could be in New York and you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>as if you traveled from New York to London.</p>
<p>So you will be having jet lag in New York,</p>
<p>even though you didn&rsquo;t do a jet lag travel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important for the adjustment.</p>
<p>And if we have time, maybe we could talk about</p>
<p>why this is important for seasonality,</p>
<p>because also it allows animals</p>
<p>to anticipate the change in season.</p>
<p>And the more you&rsquo;re high in the North or the South,</p>
<p>the more that these weather changes occur very harshly</p>
<p>and you have to be ready for them.</p>
<p>And that happens in us as well.</p>
<p>All right, we will definitely get into seasonality.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve got this subconscious vision</p>
<p>that aligns us with the turn of the earth.</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>What is the machinery that allows that to happen?</p>
<p>And how does that machinery work?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we knew that in mammals, including us,</p>
<p>we are mammals, humans,</p>
<p>that the eyes are required for this function.</p>
<p>So if humans are born without eyes</p>
<p>or the optic nerves are damaged,</p>
<p>humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle.</p>
<p>So we know that the eyes are required.</p>
<p>And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot</p>
<p>before 2000, we thought-</p>
<p>What did you say, before the year 2000?</p>
<p>Before the year 2000, yes.</p>
<p>We thought it&rsquo;s these photoreceptors in your retina</p>
<p>that allow you to see.</p>
<p>So in the human retinas,</p>
<p>there are two types of photoreceptors.</p>
<p>They are called rods and cones because of their shapes.</p>
<p>And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy,</p>
<p>which light is made of,</p>
<p>and they change it in a way to an electrical signal</p>
<p>that allow us to build the image of the environment</p>
<p>in our cortices.</p>
<p>Subconsciously.</p>
<p>Consciously, in this situation,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s vision, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s image-forming vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a visual cortex and associative cortices,</p>
<p>which allow you to build conscious perception</p>
<p>of the environment.</p>
<p>However, people have found,</p>
<p>including me with the work of David Burson</p>
<p>and Ignacio Provencio,</p>
<p>that there is a subset of ganglion cells.</p>
<p>The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina,</p>
<p>their axon, leave the retina,</p>
<p>and project to the brain.</p>
<p>So these were thought to only relay rod and cone information</p>
<p>from the light environment to the brain,</p>
<p>but we found that a small subset of these ganglion cells</p>
<p>are themselves photoreceptors</p>
<p>that were completely missed in the retina.</p>
<p>And these are the photoreceptors</p>
<p>that relay light environment subconsciously</p>
<p>to the areas in the brain that have and house</p>
<p>the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker,</p>
<p>which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies</p>
<p>to the central brain clock</p>
<p>that allows them to entrain</p>
<p>to the 24-hour light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>So as I recall,</p>
<p>because I was a graduate student at the time,</p>
<p>in the year 2000,</p>
<p>there was this landmark discovery made by you,</p>
<p>Ignacio Provencio, David Burson, and others,</p>
<p>that these cells exist</p>
<p>that can communicate day and night information to the brain</p>
<p>in this very small subset of cells.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>but maybe you can confirm or refute,</p>
<p>that this system that connects the eyes</p>
<p>to the rest of the brain</p>
<p>is actually the most ancient form of vision,</p>
<p>that this is probably the form of vision</p>
<p>that some early version of human beings had</p>
<p>before they had pattern vision,</p>
<p>before they could see colors and shapes</p>
<p>and motion and all that,</p>
<p>and that the same cells that perform this role</p>
<p>are actually similar to insect eyes.</p>
<p>I think I heard David Burson say once</p>
<p>that we actually have a little bit of the fly eye</p>
<p>in our eye.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really interesting, actually,</p>
<p>because these same IPRGCs we discovered,</p>
<p>they contribute a little bit to image formation,</p>
<p>and now work from Tiffany Schmidt</p>
<p>specifically have proven</p>
<p>that they do contribute to image-forming functions,</p>
<p>but they contribute to very limited aspect</p>
<p>of image formation,</p>
<p>so it fits your hypothesis</p>
<p>that these are an ancient photoreceptors.</p>
<p>The other thing that adds to that hypothesis</p>
<p>is that they are expressed in cells</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have any modification</p>
<p>that make them look like photoreceptors,</p>
<p>so the photoreceptors that I told you about</p>
<p>that are important for vision, image formation,</p>
<p>they have very specialized structures</p>
<p>that allow them to pack these structures</p>
<p>with photopigments.</p>
<p>These are the photo-detecting proteins,</p>
<p>so they could detect a high sensitivity of photons</p>
<p>that pass through them.</p>
<p>These IPRGCs, these new photoreceptors</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have these specialized structures,</p>
<p>so they just really need a lot of light at the time.</p>
<p>We thought they need a lot of light to be activated,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why we think they are ancient,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I think they adjust to ancient functions</p>
<p>that are as important as regulating your body,</p>
<p>circadian clock, to the solar environment,</p>
<p>to solar day, or to the light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>So you mentioned IPRGCs, intrinsically photosensitive,</p>
<p>so these are cells that connect the eye to the brain</p>
<p>that behave like photoreceptors, essentially,</p>
<p>and then you mentioned melanopsin,</p>
<p>which is the actual pigment that converts the light</p>
<p>into the electrical signal, more or less,</p>
<p>and my understanding is that melanopsin</p>
<p>was identified first in frog melanophores,</p>
<p>so does that mean that we have little pieces</p>
<p>of frog skin in our eyes?</p>
<p>So, honestly, David Bersin say you have a fly in your eye</p>
<p>because it sounds better.</p>
<p>The more accurate, I think,</p>
<p>is that you have a frog skin in your eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as catchy, but really, melanopsin,</p>
<p>really, the name melanopsin is from melanocyte opsin,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s melanopsin because it was found</p>
<p>in the frog melanocytes.</p>
<p>You know the frogs can change their color</p>
<p>depending on light, and melanopsin drives this response.</p>
<p>So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered</p>
<p>these opsins in frogs, luckily he was smart enough</p>
<p>to see if they are expressed in the frog eye.</p>
<p>They were expressed in the frog eye,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what appears to be retinal ganglion cells,</p>
<p>which I told you, the one that connect the eye to the brain.</p>
<p>He had the insight to go and see</p>
<p>if they are expressed in the monkey eye,</p>
<p>and he found that they are also expressed</p>
<p>in what appears to be retinal ganglion cells,</p>
<p>and really, that what opened the field wide open.</p>
<p>Then David Bersin did the seminal experiment</p>
<p>where he went to the brain where the central oscillator,</p>
<p>the oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain</p>
<p>called the suprachiasmatic nucleus</p>
<p>that has been known for many years</p>
<p>to receive retinal input,</p>
<p>and he labeled the cells that project there,</p>
<p>and then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones,</p>
<p>you could get light responses from these cells.</p>
<p>So you could imagine, he nearly fainted</p>
<p>when he saw that these cells can respond independent,</p>
<p>completely in the absence of rod and cone input.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll never forget reading those papers in 2000, 2001.</p>
<p>I was at the meeting in DC when Iggy, Ignacio Iggy,</p>
<p>we call him Iggy, showed this image of this,</p>
<p>basically what is frog melanophores in the human eye,</p>
<p>and everyone was like, oh my goodness, this is the thing.</p>
<p>And I want to get into how light</p>
<p>actually can control circadian rhythms in a moment,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning now</p>
<p>that people who are pattern vision blind,</p>
<p>so people who cannot see, and no conscious vision,</p>
<p>but have eyes, many of them still have these cells,</p>
<p>these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells,</p>
<p>and can essentially match, or entrain, as we say,</p>
<p>onto the light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>In fact, they possibly have no problems</p>
<p>in circadian photoentrainment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have enormous sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re totally blind, but they are totally image blind.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting is that,</p>
<p>and this story I heard from Chuck Seisler,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll give him credit,</p>
<p>that some of these people who are image blind,</p>
<p>usually they get dry eyes, and they give them a lot of pain,</p>
<p>and doctors used to think, oh, since they are image blind,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting dry eye,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just remove their eyes?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not using them anymore.</p>
<p>And the minute they would remove their eyes,</p>
<p>they start having cyclical sleep problems,</p>
<p>indicating that now they are not entraining</p>
<p>to the light-dark cycle, and are having cyclical jet lags</p>
<p>when their clock shifts through the light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>and I hear from a number of blind people,</p>
<p>in my various aspects of my job,</p>
<p>and a lot of them have issues with sleep, I think,</p>
<p>in part because they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that they too need to see light</p>
<p>at particular times of day or night</p>
<p>in order to match their schedule.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s a perfect segue for us</p>
<p>to talk about how light and viewing light</p>
<p>can impact our sleep-wake rhythms.</p>
<p>And then we will move into some of the other ways</p>
<p>in which light can impact other forms of bodily function.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I love the way you set it up,</p>
<p>because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect</p>
<p>of trying to educate people about light effect</p>
<p>on subconscious vision is that it&rsquo;s subconscious.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all aware of what we think is intensity,</p>
<p>because we see the room.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you talk to people</p>
<p>who know how to take photographs and stuff like that,</p>
<p>they know that the intensity varies greatly.</p>
<p>But our system, because we have to see the same way</p>
<p>in very bright conditions and very dim conditions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not very good at estimating intensity consciously.</p>
<p>So when you try to tell people about intensity,</p>
<p>you really struggle,</p>
<p>because they think they know intensities,</p>
<p>but they really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You mean light intensity.</p>
<p>Light intensity.</p>
<p>So that the cones themselves have an incredible ability</p>
<p>to adapt to different light conditions.</p>
<p>So you can see at all different conditions.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;d be a disaster.</p>
<p>You know, if you don&rsquo;t change the setting on your camera</p>
<p>and you go from inside the room to the outside,</p>
<p>it becomes completely white.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>So if your cones don&rsquo;t adapt to the environment,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to see in this room</p>
<p>and on the beach, right?</p>
<p>But the problem is your IPRGCs,</p>
<p>the cells that we talked about,</p>
<p>they measure intensity pretty well.</p>
<p>They really know what intensity is.</p>
<p>They have a very good linear measurement of intensity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t adapt as well.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t adapt actually that much, to be honest.</p>
<p>So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used</p>
<p>to measuring light intensity in a natural environment.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in a natural environment,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have industrialized lighting,</p>
<p>then your system is functioning very well.</p>
<p>But now when we change these environments,</p>
<p>we could really mess up ourselves.</p>
<p>So you have to teach people how to understand intensity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that you have to explain to people.</p>
<p>And I think I love to do it myself.</p>
<p>I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light</p>
<p>required to allow you to see comfortably.</p>
<p>So you have to do this as a fun experiment.</p>
<p>Okay, so explain to me how this goes.</p>
<p>And maybe we could break it up in the day</p>
<p>into three or four parts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, assuming that most people wake up</p>
<p>in the morning, as opposed to night shift workers, et cetera,</p>
<p>we could talk about later.</p>
<p>But you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s divide the day into quarters.</p>
<p>What is the proper way to interact with light</p>
<p>in the first part of the day?</p>
<p>So I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up.</p>
<p>Get as much light as you can.</p>
<p>Into your eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>Your system is primed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re entrained, it&rsquo;s primed to get light.</p>
<p>The sun should be out.</p>
<p>Most animals in the wild,</p>
<p>they actually seem to track the sun.</p>
<p>The sun has a huge influence on life on Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, life on Earth is because of sun.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>In the morning, when you wake up, you need light.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is the behavioral practice</p>
<p>that you recommend?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say somebody is in a condition</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of cloud cover.</p>
<p>Is it important to get outside?</p>
<p>So I have to tell you, the cloudiest day</p>
<p>is gonna be much more brighter than your room.</p>
<p>You could ask any photographer.</p>
<p>A cloudy day, unless it&rsquo;s really dark, dark clouds,</p>
<p>usually cloudy days have much more bright outside</p>
<p>than inside the room,</p>
<p>even when you have good lighting inside the room.</p>
<p>So I think in the outside is usually,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s cloudy, you&rsquo;re gonna get enough intensity</p>
<p>to help you adjust your cycle to the day-night cycle.</p>
<p>So how long do you, these are general rules of thumb,</p>
<p>but how long do you recommend people go outside?</p>
<p>So if you do it daily, you possibly need very,</p>
<p>if you do it daily, because remember,</p>
<p>this thing is gonna happen on a daily matter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>So the clock is tracking it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s photon counting, it&rsquo;s tracking.</p>
<p>I would say 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do it daily, you may wanna increase it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about when you travel, what you could do.</p>
<p>But yeah, 15 minutes should be fun.</p>
<p>You do it more, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>And through a window, my understanding is that</p>
<p>through a window, it dramatically decreases</p>
<p>the amount of light energy coming in.</p>
<p>It depends of how thick the windows are</p>
<p>and how dark they are.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also nice to go outside and to feel the season.</p>
<p>Sunglasses off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use sunglasses.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have the Jordanian full pigment, you know?</p>
<p>So yeah, whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?</p>
<p>But I personally, if I&rsquo;m in the shade</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s not incredibly bright,</p>
<p>I try to, especially in the morning,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also an early person,</p>
<p>so we have to differentiate between early and-</p>
<p>What time do you wake up?</p>
<p>I wake up at 4.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>But the sun isn&rsquo;t out yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not out yet, so it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You turn on artificial lights?</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t turn on artificial light</p>
<p>because I know the sun is gonna come up eventually,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the change</p>
<p>in the timing that they do.</p>
<p>Wait, but what do you do between 4.30 a.m. and 7 a.m.?</p>
<p>I look at my computer and my phone,</p>
<p>so possibly I get enough light.</p>
<p>But in reality, as long as you let your body</p>
<p>get the morning sunlight, which I think is really,</p>
<p>to me, and there&rsquo;s no evidence,</p>
<p>but to me, if you look at all animals, plants,</p>
<p>this morning sunlight seems to be very important.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have experiments to show it,</p>
<p>but I have a gut feeling that it has</p>
<p>a huge impact on humans.</p>
<p>Well, Jamie Zeitzer&rsquo;s lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab</p>
<p>has shown that these early morning light flashes</p>
<p>can adjust the total amount of sleep</p>
<p>that one will get.</p>
<p>It makes it easier to get into sleep.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, so-</p>
<p>And Ken Wright also did this beautiful</p>
<p>camping experiments that showed-</p>
<p>Maybe you should describe those</p>
<p>because those are beautiful experiments.</p>
<p>They are beautiful experiments.</p>
<p>He took these college students</p>
<p>that had a late onset of sleep and late waking time,</p>
<p>and then he said, let&rsquo;s go camping</p>
<p>and just don&rsquo;t use any artificial light,</p>
<p>and you could go to sleep as late or as early as you want</p>
<p>and wake up as late as early.</p>
<p>And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern</p>
<p>just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>I mean, so-</p>
<p>And it lasted.</p>
<p>And it lasted.</p>
<p>Even after they came back.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think it was two days of camping,</p>
<p>reset the circadian clock.</p>
<p>Seven days, but it lasted, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>Okay, so get bright light of some sort</p>
<p>early in the day, ideally sunlight.</p>
<p>Even on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be brighter than indoor light.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Okay, so then-</p>
<p>And the other thing that I would like to mention to people,</p>
<p>if you think it&rsquo;s very dim outside,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s very cloudy, stay longer.</p>
<p>So remember, intensity is only one component.</p>
<p>Duration is also important</p>
<p>because remember that the circadian system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the image system.</p>
<p>In the image system, you have to change every second</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at different objects.</p>
<p>You have to change your perception.</p>
<p>But for the circadian system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying to figure out,</p>
<p>where am I in the day-night cycle?</p>
<p>So the more you give them the information,</p>
<p>the better you are.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s very bright, you don&rsquo;t need a lot</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clearly going to make you fire like crazy.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not bright, stay longer.</p>
<p>Stay for one hour.</p>
<p>You know, have your coffee outside or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to help.</p>
<p>I think you said something extremely important,</p>
<p>which is that this circadian system</p>
<p>is trying to figure out when you are in time.</p>
<p>Not where you are in space.</p>
<p>Sorry, I said where you are in time.</p>
<p>I meant when you are.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I wasn&rsquo;t correcting you.</p>
<p>I just meant that I think fundamentally</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the incredible thing about this system,</p>
<p>that you have this clock, this 24-hour clock in your brain,</p>
<p>but it needs to be synchronized to the outside.</p>
<p>So could we go a little deeper</p>
<p>into this circadian setting behavior</p>
<p>and come up with some general rules of thumb?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a very bright day, extremely bright.</p>
<p>No clouds, sun&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you&rsquo;re sensitive,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to go in the sun.</p>
<p>You could be in the shade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be so many photons out there in the shade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be perfect.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to see the sun.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have the sun.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s great for vitamin D.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>You could do this for your skin and protect your skin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my area of expertise.</p>
<p>But for that effect on the circadian system,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re outside in the shade and it&rsquo;s a sunny day,</p>
<p>10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.</p>
<p>Okay, and then let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s kind of overcast.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not particularly bright</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s solid cloud cover,</p>
<p>but obviously the sun is out, but it&rsquo;s not as bright.</p>
<p>How long do you think it would take to set the clock?</p>
<p>10 to 15 should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Stay for half an hour, stay for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s very dark cloud, yeah, stay for longer.</p>
<p>Okay, and if for some reason one finds themselves</p>
<p>very far north and it&rsquo;s very, very dense cloud cover,</p>
<p>how long and at what point should somebody consider</p>
<p>using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight?</p>
<p>Yeah, honestly, this is where we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a lot of information still,</p>
<p>because this is where we&rsquo;re going to discuss this</p>
<p>maybe in more detail,</p>
<p>that if you put humans in artificial conditions,</p>
<p>the circadian system is very sensitive to light.</p>
<p>But in reality, in the real environment,</p>
<p>light also is affecting other aspects</p>
<p>that are independent of the setting</p>
<p>of the circadian pacemaker.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And these, which we call the direct effect of light</p>
<p>on mood, for example.</p>
<p>So that is very hard to figure out</p>
<p>what intensity you need to use.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t done enough experiments</p>
<p>because the system has been discovered just recently.</p>
<p>But I would say if you use bright light in the morning,</p>
<p>and I mean, it&rsquo;s hard for me to give numbers,</p>
<p>it can get complicated.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, if you&rsquo;re, honestly,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re that far north and you&rsquo;re in the winter</p>
<p>and you want to get, make sure you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>use these light boxes.</p>
<p>I would suggest that personally, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I use, it&rsquo;s actually not designed for circadian setting,</p>
<p>but I have a 930 lux light pad</p>
<p>that I bought and I bought it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very affordable compared</p>
<p>to the dawn simulating lights,</p>
<p>which are quite expensive, frankly.</p>
<p>And I put it there.</p>
<p>And so I just basically, when I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>I use that until the sun comes out.</p>
<p>And then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside,</p>
<p>but I keep that thing on all day.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>Is it good or bad?</p>
<p>I honestly, I don&rsquo;t think being exposed to bright light</p>
<p>in the day is going to ever be bad</p>
<p>because really if you&rsquo;re outside in the day,</p>
<p>unless, you know, the worst is going to happen</p>
<p>if the temperature is very high,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s going to say, don&rsquo;t dehydrate and go to sleep.</p>
<p>So you could tell actually sometimes when it&rsquo;s very hot,</p>
<p>the more you get exposed to bright light,</p>
<p>the sleepier you feel in the afternoon,</p>
<p>which is counterintuitive.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to protect us, you think, against dehydration?</p>
<p>I think if you think about the human evolution</p>
<p>from near the equator in the,</p>
<p>between noon and a certain time in the afternoon,</p>
<p>it would have been very hard for you to maintain</p>
<p>physiological homeostatic function,</p>
<p>being active at this very high temperature time.</p>
<p>So I think napping was a way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I think it has a major function,</p>
<p>which is still,</p>
<p>napping was a way to somehow take you away</p>
<p>from that dangerous zone.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why people in the North,</p>
<p>they say in the winter, we can&rsquo;t wake up in the morning</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have this long light.</p>
<p>So they sleep it more at night.</p>
<p>But in the summer, they say,</p>
<p>we feel like we can&rsquo;t go to sleep.</p>
<p>We have to put all these dark curtains.</p>
<p>So I think, you know,</p>
<p>venturing that much up North has been,</p>
<p>came up with problem because evolution was used</p>
<p>to a certain light environment</p>
<p>that was completely changed with a human.</p>
<p>With other animals, I think, that lived there longer,</p>
<p>they have come up with very interesting adaptation</p>
<p>of actually measuring even very small changes</p>
<p>in the light intensities that still occur.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re near the poles,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s always light,</p>
<p>but there is a change in the light intensity</p>
<p>across the day and night cycle.</p>
<p>So your system, if it&rsquo;s linear,</p>
<p>and remember, I told you that IPRGCs are incredibly linear,</p>
<p>can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light,</p>
<p>if the organism has the ability to do that.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent so much time learning from you, fortunately,</p>
<p>about these cells,</p>
<p>and yet I never really appreciated until now</p>
<p>how, on the one hand, they are tracking the amount of light</p>
<p>to understand when we are in time</p>
<p>relative to the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>but also that you keep mentioning</p>
<p>this linear measurement of intensity,</p>
<p>that they really are trying to figure out</p>
<p>when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light.</p>
<p>And of course, the sun is the most intense source</p>
<p>of light available to us.</p>
<p>So, okay, so I think we&rsquo;ve nailed down</p>
<p>that first part of the day.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s get 10 to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how bright it is,</p>
<p>and try and do that as often as possible</p>
<p>to give the system a regular-</p>
<p>Daily is the best.</p>
<p>This system is really about,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see that even for the effect on depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about multiple days.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to worry if you missed it one day,</p>
<p>you know, stay longer if you want,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re in a hurry and you want to do other stuff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great recommendation.</p>
<p>So you might want to compensate with some extra time</p>
<p>if you missed a day or two.</p>
<p>And this is why I&rsquo;ve heard you say before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entirely possible to get severely jet-lagged</p>
<p>without traveling.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much,</p>
<p>not getting the sunlight.</p>
<p>And you saw this during the pandemic.</p>
<p>A lot of people mentioned</p>
<p>that their sleep-wake cycle suffered a lot.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re not going out,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re staying at home,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have big windows,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waking late, waking up late,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re using very bright light till late at night,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s going to shift.</p>
<p>And now your day is going to start instead of like,</p>
<p>really when the sun comes up,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>your day is going to start at 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what your body&rsquo;s going to think</p>
<p>is the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re not going to be able to sleep</p>
<p>at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night,</p>
<p>because now that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>for your body, it&rsquo;s completely different timing.</p>
<p>And you could see this happen during the pandemic</p>
<p>at a very high scale.</p>
<p>People get delayed in their sleep-wake cycle a lot.</p>
<p>There is this idea of chronotypes</p>
<p>that we all each intrinsically have a best rhythm</p>
<p>of either being a morning person,</p>
<p>you call yourself an early person,</p>
<p>or a night owl,</p>
<p>or more of a kind of standard,</p>
<p>to bed around 10.30, up around seven type thing.</p>
<p>And I think there are now good data,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>from the National Institutes of Mental Health and elsewhere,</p>
<p>showing that the more we deviate from that intrinsic rhythm,</p>
<p>the more mental health issues</p>
<p>and physical health issues start to crop up.</p>
<p>So there is great data on this,</p>
<p>and there is a couple of things that complicate this.</p>
<p>The first is the people who usually are late.</p>
<p>They tell you that the society doesn&rsquo;t accommodate them.</p>
<p>What, by late, what do you mean?</p>
<p>People that wake up late and go to sleep late?</p>
<p>Go to sleep late and wake up late.</p>
<p>They have an overwhelmingly higher level</p>
<p>of depression and failures.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly, I mean,</p>
<p>the reason that people say sleep early,</p>
<p>wake up early, you&rsquo;re better,</p>
<p>because human notice that people who wake up,</p>
<p>go to sleep early and wake up early,</p>
<p>they do better in life.</p>
<p>They notice that.</p>
<p>They just perform better.</p>
<p>They perform.</p>
<p>But the question is, is that intrinsic to the system,</p>
<p>or is that society?</p>
<p>Because society start things usually early or late.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard question.</p>
<p>We discriminate against late risers.</p>
<p>In a way, we discriminate, right?</p>
<p>But the other explanation is Ken Wright&rsquo;s experiment.</p>
<p>These late risers,</p>
<p>if they were truly chronotypically late,</p>
<p>why would they shift so easily</p>
<p>when you put them in the,</p>
<p>if you were really chronotypically late,</p>
<p>and there is a phase relation</p>
<p>between the light-dark environment</p>
<p>and your circadian clock,</p>
<p>then doing this camping experiment</p>
<p>should not have caused much changes,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not that, you know,</p>
<p>light is gonna affect you in a certain way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that this is the relationship</p>
<p>that your body decided,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a late sleeper, late waking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m honestly, I&rsquo;m still unable to figure out</p>
<p>how much of this late waking up</p>
<p>is controlled by the light environment,</p>
<p>and how much is intrinsic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are differences,</p>
<p>but are they as big as we see in the environment?</p>
<p>Because you have people that go up to sleep</p>
<p>at 7 p.m. and wake up at 1 a.m.</p>
<p>These are clearly advanced phase.</p>
<p>So people that go to sleep at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>and wake up at 1 a.m.</p>
<p>and feel good doing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure they feel good,</p>
<p>but a lot of the time you talk to people,</p>
<p>they say they are high achievers,</p>
<p>but they suffer because, you know,</p>
<p>they wake up, they go to 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>wake up, advanced phase sleep syndrome,</p>
<p>they call it, they call it a syndrome.</p>
<p>But, you know, but then you have people</p>
<p>who would not be able to sleep till 5 a.m.</p>
<p>and not be able to wake up till 3 p.m., right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not so sure that the circadian system</p>
<p>is that variable in the human population.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly there are maybe some genetic factors</p>
<p>that make a small percentage of, like,</p>
<p>everything with a bell shape,</p>
<p>but I think most of the time</p>
<p>the light environment may play a role.</p>
<p>And once, as we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>this is a long-term effect of light.</p>
<p>Once you get into a rhythm,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean it as a pun,</p>
<p>in reality, once you get into a rhythm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to break out of that rhythm</p>
<p>because if you start sleeping late</p>
<p>and waking up late,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just gonna be late.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re like me, waking up early,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting what Zeissler said,</p>
<p>I said his last name wrong,</p>
<p>the one in Stanford who did the-</p>
<p>Oh, Jamie Zeissler.</p>
<p>Zeissler, yeah.</p>
<p>He actually worked for Zeissler.</p>
<p>So Zeissler and Zeissler.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are a lot of Z&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;s in their names.</p>
<p>Both phenomenal scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What it seems to me is the case</p>
<p>is that the only way to really know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re meant to be an early bird,</p>
<p>as they call it, an early person or a late person,</p>
<p>or somewhere in between,</p>
<p>is to get morning sunlight</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better.</p>
<p>And to understand,</p>
<p>to be educated about how to measure intensity,</p>
<p>how to measure, I put it between quotation,</p>
<p>because you either get a measuring device,</p>
<p>but you cannot depend on your eye to measure intensity.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we do that?</p>
<p>Because you keep coming back to this,</p>
<p>so that tells me that it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So there are apps, like free apps,</p>
<p>like Light Meter, where you can walk around</p>
<p>and hold the button down</p>
<p>and see how many lux are in the environment.</p>
<p>These are complicated</p>
<p>because you have to point them to specific regions.</p>
<p>So how do people start to develop an intuitive sense</p>
<p>of the measurement of intensity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think at one point I posted on Instagram</p>
<p>how I keep my nighttime at home.</p>
<p>And I found out that my night vision is very strong.</p>
<p>So I found out that I, especially in the winter,</p>
<p>I only need candle lights.</p>
<p>So I literally use these tea lights</p>
<p>and I put like 15 or 20 of them.</p>
<p>How romantic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>I could see it clearly doesn&rsquo;t affect my circadian system.</p>
<p>You and your cat.</p>
<p>And my wife.</p>
<p>And your wife, of course.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just great, right?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t expect people</p>
<p>to have the same night vision as me.</p>
<p>So the simple, I mean, I tell people, do the experiment.</p>
<p>So if you put three or four lights in your room,</p>
<p>switch two, sit for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Switch two off.</p>
<p>Switch two off.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re using five.</p>
<p>And see, after 15 minutes,</p>
<p>you will not recognize you switched these two off.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that most people would need</p>
<p>at least 10 times less light than they use at night to see.</p>
<p>The problem people use it</p>
<p>because most of the time they didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>They are actually hungry for light without their knowledge.</p>
<p>So they come switch all these lights on,</p>
<p>but at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Because they woke up late.</p>
<p>Okay, now I understand.</p>
<p>So this morning light viewing</p>
<p>goes way beyond setting your clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a way to determine</p>
<p>how little light you need later in the day.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about this in a moment,</p>
<p>but how little light you get later in the day</p>
<p>is a very strong determinant of things</p>
<p>like when you will wake up,</p>
<p>whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, et cetera.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break it on your show, Andrew,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to tell you,</p>
<p>I think there is something else</p>
<p>that people need to think about,</p>
<p>which is the tripartite model.</p>
<p>That this model incorporate three components,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in details,</p>
<p>that allows us humans and all animals</p>
<p>to incorporate the circadian clock</p>
<p>and its relation to light,</p>
<p>the homeostatic drive,</p>
<p>and the direct effect of the environment,</p>
<p>which includes stress, light, all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>They have to be incorporated together.</p>
<p>If you think, that&rsquo;s what I think right now,</p>
<p>if you think of one alone,</p>
<p>you will always miss something.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When you think of them as a whole,</p>
<p>things really become clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite amazing.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we will definitely want to hear</p>
<p>about your tripartite theory</p>
<p>and go into detail about this homeostatic mechanisms.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that for people</p>
<p>who are thinking now, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>about light and how it impacts them.</p>
<p>So the morning light viewing behavior,</p>
<p>I like to think we&rsquo;ve tacked down clearly.</p>
<p>And thank you for that,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much information out there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried to relay that information.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re my primary source</p>
<p>for all things circadian,</p>
<p>as well as Jamie and others, of course,</p>
<p>and Matt Walker.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;ve made that very, very clear.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ve gotten my morning sunlight, okay?</p>
<p>Made my bright artificial light.</p>
<p>And throughout the day, you said to get a lot of light.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m working at my desk.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll go out during the day a few times,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m working at my computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing things.</p>
<p>Is there anything about light viewing</p>
<p>in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind?</p>
<p>Or can they just sort of freestyle it,</p>
<p>depending on what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Most people are not in a dark room throughout the day.</p>
<p>My gut feeling, if you got your morning sunlight,</p>
<p>you walk from your car slowly,</p>
<p>or you walk to work,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t wear sunglasses</p>
<p>when the lights were still dim in the morning,</p>
<p>that you could freestyle it.</p>
<p>That even if you don&rsquo;t get a lot of light,</p>
<p>there is a way to just, in the day,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to just worry</p>
<p>about getting a lot of bright light.</p>
<p>But personally, I like to do that.</p>
<p>So I go out at lunch and have my lunch outside as well.</p>
<p>This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now.</p>
<p>But the evidence is that you could literally</p>
<p>help your circadian clock</p>
<p>by giving lights at dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>But again, if you think of the tripartite model,</p>
<p>this may be important versus circadian clock,</p>
<p>but is it important for your mood?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I think you need,</p>
<p>or the homeostatic drive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you need to think about it.</p>
<p>So for the clock, for entraining your clock,</p>
<p>you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight.</p>
<p>You actually don&rsquo;t need dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>People even forget that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I appreciate that you&rsquo;re distinguishing</p>
<p>between circadian effects and other effects of light.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being very precise, which is appreciated.</p>
<p>Until we hear about this tripartite model,</p>
<p>which we will cover, for the sake of the discussion,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s treat the light viewing behavior</p>
<p>as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light</p>
<p>for all biological purposes, not just circadian setting.</p>
<p>So in the morning, it&rsquo;s clearly going to set the clock.</p>
<p>And then during the day, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>the idea is to get as much bright light as you can,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re feeding, it sounds like,</p>
<p>a sort of light hunger.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I love this way to put it.</p>
<p>I think there is a weird light hunger,</p>
<p>considering that we&rsquo;re not photosynthetic organisms.</p>
<p>There is a weird light hunger in animals</p>
<p>that they need to measure, they need measure.</p>
<p>And I think that relates to the season,</p>
<p>because the whole reproduction cycle of animals</p>
<p>is going to depend on the availability</p>
<p>of food in the environment.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know when the season&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have calendars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to survive.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s why we have this light hunger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a major hypothesis, it&rsquo;s not being tested.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So then afternoon and evening start to approach.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had this weird experience,</p>
<p>maybe you can psychologically</p>
<p>or biologically diagnose me now, Samer.</p>
<p>So where if I go into a movie in the afternoon,</p>
<p>like a matinee, and I come out and it&rsquo;s dark,</p>
<p>I notice a significant drop in my mood</p>
<p>and my ability to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the sunset,</p>
<p>although sunsets are nice,</p>
<p>but I get some light pulse in the afternoon</p>
<p>that I have no trouble whatsoever falling asleep.</p>
<p>And it happens in a daily, on a single time to watch them?</p>
<p>More or less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned the camping experiment,</p>
<p>where when they went camping,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re seeing the sunrise and the sunset.</p>
<p>So what should people do in the afternoon slash evening time</p>
<p>in terms of their light viewing behavior?</p>
<p>I mean, the best thing to do</p>
<p>is to let the natural light creep in into darkness, right?</p>
<p>That would be the best.</p>
<p>But clearly that would be inefficient.</p>
<p>You wanna go home, you wanna read,</p>
<p>you wanna talk to your kids,</p>
<p>you wanna talk to your family.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, it&rsquo;s nice to extend the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>If you somehow can block that light</p>
<p>from affecting your circadian clock.</p>
<p>So should people use blue blockers in the evening?</p>
<p>I personally do not like any blockers</p>
<p>that take a single wavelength of light.</p>
<p>Because again, if you think of a holistic approach,</p>
<p>yes, the blue blocker is gonna prevent you</p>
<p>from affecting your circadian clock very much.</p>
<p>But then your vision is gonna be distorted</p>
<p>because we always see in full spectrum.</p>
<p>The sun has this beautiful spectrum, right?</p>
<p>And then when you start seeing without the blue,</p>
<p>things look yellow and it can get really weird, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so I personally, I&rsquo;ve tried the blue blocker</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t even wear them.</p>
<p>I thought they were just really horrendous, to be honest.</p>
<p>Well, along the lines of blue blockers,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that would be very bad.</p>
<p>A lot of people do that.</p>
<p>A lot of people do that.</p>
<p>They think that blue light is bad.</p>
<p>I think that the concept of blue light being bad</p>
<p>led to a lot of product development.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are just assuming</p>
<p>that viewing blue light is what was giving them headaches</p>
<p>when in fact it might&rsquo;ve just been looking at screens</p>
<p>at close distance.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the problem, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the blue light got the bad reputation</p>
<p>because people who gave a pure blue light</p>
<p>showed that it caused a huge retinal damage.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re using blue light in its pure form,</p>
<p>it has a lot of energy because it&rsquo;s shorter wavelength.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about full spectrum light.</p>
<p>There are ways now where you could change the spectrum</p>
<p>of the light and keep it white between day and night</p>
<p>and change the content of the color without you noticing.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t even have to affect your vision.</p>
<p>So how would you go about doing that?</p>
<p>So you just lower the level of the blue light.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to eliminate it.</p>
<p>So just dim the lights.</p>
<p>Dim the blue, but then increase the yellow,</p>
<p>but keep all the colors in a certain white.</p>
<p>So you could have different warmness of white.</p>
<p>And people know how to do this.</p>
<p>Physicists know how to do this.</p>
<p>People who work with light know how to do this.</p>
<p>Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the word,</p>
<p>but biohacking or optical community will do this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>I see so many people wear blue lockers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they love it.</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re just uninformed.</p>
<p>I think, frankly-</p>
<p>And to be honest, it&rsquo;s easy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to explain to somebody.</p>
<p>If IPRGC respond mostly to blue, remove blue,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be fine, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not as simple as that</p>
<p>because they also receive Rhode Island cone input.</p>
<p>And we could go into details</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s boring for your listeners,</p>
<p>but it also affect the adaptation properties</p>
<p>of the whole retina.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to do something so drastic</p>
<p>that you take just one color of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It just seems very counterintuitive to me, to be honest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve told me before as well</p>
<p>that just because these intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>circadian setting ganglion cells respond best to blue light,</p>
<p>if the light is bright enough,</p>
<p>because they also get input</p>
<p>from other components of the eye,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you block the blues.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at bright light at night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to disrupt your circadian cycle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to go into the boring details,</p>
<p>but themselves, the photoreceptors</p>
<p>have a wide range of responsiveness.</p>
<p>So they are most sensitive to blue light,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t respond to green light</p>
<p>or to shorter than blue light.</p>
<p>They respond to very, very wide spectrum</p>
<p>with different sensitivities.</p>
<p>So unless you understand the system,</p>
<p>just removing 480, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to do anything.</p>
<p>480 nanometers, yeah.</p>
<p>So your home is a cave at night, basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice cave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice cave with candles, right?</p>
<p>And you and your cats and your lovely wife,</p>
<p>who I know who&rsquo;s also a phenomenal scientist</p>
<p>in her own right.</p>
<p>Yeah, she is.</p>
<p>She is, but you do keep your home</p>
<p>quite dim to dark at night.</p>
<p>In fact, I did go to meetings</p>
<p>with some of my friends who work on this,</p>
<p>and they really struggled with me.</p>
<p>They said, we could have broken our legs</p>
<p>living in the same light environment that you do.</p>
<p>So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself,</p>
<p>and I asked Reji, my wife, if she&rsquo;s okay with it.</p>
<p>She also liked the dimness.</p>
<p>Both of us can see well in dim conditions,</p>
<p>and that helps us a lot.</p>
<p>But I think you have to measure it for yourself.</p>
<p>You really have to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple experiment.</p>
<p>Just try to dim the light as much as you can.</p>
<p>I call it the minimum amount of light</p>
<p>you require to see comfortably.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you want your environment ideally at night.</p>
<p>This is what I think is the game changer.</p>
<p>If you reach to a level where it&rsquo;s just barely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably</p>
<p>versus seeing very comfortably,</p>
<p>you are gonna be very much better than,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to make it completely dark.</p>
<p>I think complete darkness induce anxiety in humans,</p>
<p>to be honest, so I don&rsquo;t like complete darkness.</p>
<p>In fact-</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t like complete darkness.</p>
<p>They like a night light.</p>
<p>Even nocturnal animals don&rsquo;t like complete darkness.</p>
<p>I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal</p>
<p>that if you put them in complete darkness for several weeks,</p>
<p>they have severe anxiety and depression-like effect.</p>
<p>So keep the light dim.</p>
<p>Use red light that is very dim.</p>
<p>If you wanna keep the room for sleeping,</p>
<p>red light that is very dim has very small effect</p>
<p>on circadian clock.</p>
<p>And below 10 lux of red light</p>
<p>literally doesn&rsquo;t affect sleep at all.</p>
<p>So there are ways to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just we need to educate the public.</p>
<p>And I feel like you literally need a whole lecture</p>
<p>to just explain to the people how to deal with light</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as simple as people think.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stepping through it piece by piece</p>
<p>and the reason we&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s not as simple as saying</p>
<p>just block blue light or get a lot of light during the day</p>
<p>and minimal at night.</p>
<p>I mean, just to put it in perspective to tell it,</p>
<p>we only have three different cones in our retina</p>
<p>that respond to three different colors.</p>
<p>We call them red cones for simplicity,</p>
<p>green cones and blue cones.</p>
<p>Yet we have only three of these,</p>
<p>but we could see massive palette of colors.</p>
<p>So that tells you something.</p>
<p>If the system was just simply about a single color</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just removing 480 or just blue is sufficient,</p>
<p>then we should only see in red, yellow and blue.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t see all these different hues of color,</p>
<p>but because the system is not that,</p>
<p>we see all these different colors.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to remind people</p>
<p>that the white light is made of many different colors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually like the rainbow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see the rainbow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of many colors.</p>
<p>White light is never truly white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of a lot of different colors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Pink Floyd album cover.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally</p>
<p>or candle light, find that minimum required light level.</p>
<p>Just make sure when you lower the light,</p>
<p>sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes,</p>
<p>let your system adapt.</p>
<p>Because if you had a bright light and you switch it off,</p>
<p>surely you&rsquo;re going to suffer</p>
<p>because your system didn&rsquo;t adapt it.</p>
<p>It was used to very bright light.</p>
<p>So you want to engage your rods,</p>
<p>which take a long time to dark adapt.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I tell you, just wait a little bit.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just switch it off, I don&rsquo;t see, put it on.</p>
<p>Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,</p>
<p>ideally 15 minutes, and then see how you see.</p>
<p>And then once you do that,</p>
<p>you will notice that actually, yeah,</p>
<p>I could see quite well, even with much less light.</p>
<p>What do you do regarding screens?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the hardest thing.</p>
<p>Again, I mean, there are beautiful programs</p>
<p>that change the whole intensity and color of the screen.</p>
<p>These could help dim your screen at night</p>
<p>to the lowest part.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, you won&rsquo;t see it when you wake up</p>
<p>in the morning, but then you can increase the intensity.</p>
<p>So try to decrease.</p>
<p>I mean, just what we were talking about.</p>
<p>Think of light intensity, duration, color,</p>
<p>and time of day.</p>
<p>You really have to keep these four things together, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve roomed together at a couple of meetings</p>
<p>from time to time, no longer,</p>
<p>because one of us, not to be named,</p>
<p>has a severe snoring issue</p>
<p>that made the other one pseudo-homicidal.</p>
<p>You can guess who that was.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen you check your phone after dark</p>
<p>once or twice, and you did it by sort of</p>
<p>pointing your phone away from you, right?</p>
<p>And actually, I&rsquo;m sort of half joking,</p>
<p>but I, and you dim it quite a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of half joking, but it actually makes sense</p>
<p>that if you shine a flashlight in your eye,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much brighter than if you shine a flashlight on the-</p>
<p>Light only go in direct light.</p>
<p>So if you just look on the side,</p>
<p>most of the light is gonna go this way,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re only seeing this way.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, okay.</p>
<p>So, and as silly as that might seem to people listening,</p>
<p>I mean, what it means is that</p>
<p>getting bright light in your eyes at night</p>
<p>is something that you really want to avoid,</p>
<p>but there is the reality that-</p>
<p>And even when I check sometimes,</p>
<p>if I have something and I check it so fast</p>
<p>and switch it off so fast,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m also aware of the durations.</p>
<p>Not my messages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also aware of the duration, right?</p>
<p>So duration, intensity, color, and time of day.</p>
<p>Ideally, I should not check iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use iPad at night</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to lower it enough</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a huge, but even my iPhone,</p>
<p>I try not to use it at night.</p>
<p>And like once it becomes 8.30 or nine,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at it at all.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s World Cup or Euro Cup,</p>
<p>in which case Sam is on 24 hours, everybody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only every four years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big soccer fan.</p>
<p>All right, this has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the relationship between light</p>
<p>and some of these other non-circadian</p>
<p>or pseudo-circadian effects.</p>
<p>And we will try and link those.</p>
<p>But you had a, what I consider absolutely landmark,</p>
<p>beautiful paper published in Nature a few years ago,</p>
<p>showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light</p>
<p>or the timing of the exposure to light,</p>
<p>that there are dramatic effects on the stress system</p>
<p>and on the learning and memory system.</p>
<p>We could talk about each of those separately or together.</p>
<p>What are the effects on stress</p>
<p>and the effects on learning when light-viewing behavior</p>
<p>and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just to remind you, you know that,</p>
<p>but to remind your listeners that I was trained</p>
<p>as a circadian biologist.</p>
<p>So I really was indoctrinated into thinking</p>
<p>that light has to affect the clock,</p>
<p>which then cause all these different effects.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dogma.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what have made me really happy.</p>
<p>And then Tara Legates and Kara Ultimus joined the lab</p>
<p>and said, and we started discussing a lot of data.</p>
<p>And we said, what if there is a direct effect of light</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re missing, independent of the circadian clock?</p>
<p>So this is not an easy question to answer</p>
<p>because as we&rsquo;ve been talking all along,</p>
<p>light affects the circadian clock.</p>
<p>So how could you give light at different times of the day</p>
<p>and not mess up the circadian clock?</p>
<p>Luckily, we came up with such a way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it was important to do these experiments</p>
<p>the way we did them.</p>
<p>And we proved that this light-dark cycle</p>
<p>does not disrupt the clock.</p>
<p>There is still a circadian rhythm</p>
<p>and does not cause sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>And yet, surprisingly, if you give light</p>
<p>at the wrong time of the day,</p>
<p>even without disrupting the circadian clock</p>
<p>or without causing sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, you get huge mood changes</p>
<p>in the organisms and you get learning deficit.</p>
<p>So this really, and at the time,</p>
<p>people have really hit us hard.</p>
<p>I mean, it was really hard to publish this work.</p>
<p>And you could, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it came out in nature.</p>
<p>So in the end, you prevailed.</p>
<p>But I want to make sure that I understand.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that, yes,</p>
<p>there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Meaning sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And their timing.</p>
<p>However, there are direct effects of light on mood</p>
<p>that can be dissociated from the effects</p>
<p>on sleep and waking.</p>
<p>So if I interpret that correctly,</p>
<p>that could mean that when we view light</p>
<p>and how much light could make us feel happier</p>
<p>or less happy or even depressed,</p>
<p>stressed, learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re sleeping and waking up</p>
<p>at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>I mean, eventually, because we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the whole system,</p>
<p>eventually when you start having the other problems,</p>
<p>you also develop sleep problems.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And in fact, now, research from Diego Fernandez</p>
<p>in the lab have found that now we know</p>
<p>that they actually require different brain regions.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t only have a theory,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t only have a light environment</p>
<p>that showed they can be dissociated.</p>
<p>We know that they use completely different brain regions.</p>
<p>So the SCN that I told you about earlier,</p>
<p>the place where the central pacemaker is,</p>
<p>the one that receives direct input</p>
<p>from the retina through the IPRGCs</p>
<p>to adjust your circadian clock,</p>
<p>is not the area that receives the light input</p>
<p>for mood regulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different brain region.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the brain region called?</p>
<p>So the brain region,</p>
<p>we called it the perihavineolar nucleus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure how good or bad the name,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s the PHB.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really amazing,</p>
<p>this region also receives direct input</p>
<p>from the IPRGCs, but projects to areas in the brain</p>
<p>that are known to regulate mood,</p>
<p>including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which has been studied for many years</p>
<p>to be impacted in a human depression.</p>
<p>So just by this amazing serendipity</p>
<p>to find that a region that is so deep</p>
<p>in the advanced brain,</p>
<p>like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain,</p>
<p>one of the most elaborated in humans,</p>
<p>to see that they receive input</p>
<p>from this ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us</p>
<p>and told us how much we didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the importance of light on human behavior.</p>
<p>So how does that finding inform daily protocols</p>
<p>for you or for other people?</p>
<p>I realize you can&rsquo;t leap to always from one paper</p>
<p>to daily protocols,</p>
<p>but if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>executive function, learning, stress, and mood,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m waking up each morning</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sleeping, what should I do differently?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we came up with the tripartite model</p>
<p>because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock</p>
<p>with lights in and being dark throughout the day,</p>
<p>but that may not be important</p>
<p>for your whole physiological function.</p>
<p>So now if we include these other effects of light,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in very dim light condition</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So even though it doesn&rsquo;t affect your clock,</p>
<p>as you beautifully said, Andrew,</p>
<p>it may affect your mood and learning and memory.</p>
<p>It may affect your alertness level,</p>
<p>which is going to allow you to learn better.</p>
<p>It may affect your homeostatic drive.</p>
<p>Maybe your homeostatic factor will go higher</p>
<p>so you could sleep earlier.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to think of light</p>
<p>as stimulating all these brain regions,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s producing more activity,</p>
<p>which in reality,</p>
<p>this is how people think of the homeostatic drive,</p>
<p>that the more active you are,</p>
<p>the more the homeostatic drive is built up,</p>
<p>the better you sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we came up with the tripartite model,</p>
<p>because as a circadian biologist,</p>
<p>I only thought of light through the circadian clock</p>
<p>affecting behavior.</p>
<p>As a sleep biologist,</p>
<p>they only thought of the homeostatic drive</p>
<p>affecting sleep, affecting behavior.</p>
<p>And for people who study light for vision and other things,</p>
<p>they thought only of the environmental input.</p>
<p>But now if you put them all together,</p>
<p>you get with this tripartite model</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really mind-boggling and it makes so much sense.</p>
<p>The organism doesn&rsquo;t want to depend on a single component,</p>
<p>but if you could incorporate these three together,</p>
<p>you could have a beautiful system that is well adapted.</p>
<p>So let me tell you the sleep-wake cycle, right?</p>
<p>So we know there is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had beautiful talks about that.</p>
<p>Which is basically the longer you&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>the more you want to be asleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your homeostatic drive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the circadian influence of sleep</p>
<p>and the fact that light-dark cycle</p>
<p>affect the circadian system,</p>
<p>which eventually affects sleep.</p>
<p>So these two components are well understood.</p>
<p>Now the third factor is your direct light</p>
<p>or environmental input.</p>
<p>How much stress, how much light you get from there</p>
<p>also can highly impact sleep.</p>
<p>So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting light at the wrong time of the day</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re being stressed and thinking,</p>
<p>then your sleep is going to suffer.</p>
<p>So you have to think of the three together</p>
<p>to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we came up with the tripartite model.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with feeding.</p>
<p>I could beautifully put it to people.</p>
<p>Your hunger, your energy level</p>
<p>is measured by the arcuate nucleus.</p>
<p>Your daily intake of food is, again,</p>
<p>dependent on the SCN and light-dark input.</p>
<p>We found that if food is not available,</p>
<p>there is yet a third input that is not dependent on the SCN,</p>
<p>not dependent on the arcuate,</p>
<p>depending on a completely different brain regions.</p>
<p>So the animal can actually start looking</p>
<p>or the human can start looking for food when it&rsquo;s scarce,</p>
<p>even at time when they are not supposed to be active.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the organism think</p>
<p>they have to evaluate multiple inputs</p>
<p>for them to decide what is the best physiological outcome</p>
<p>at that moment, at that season.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So I want to get into arcuate and feeding,</p>
<p>but just to make sure we can keep our hands</p>
<p>around this tripartite model.</p>
<p>So if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the circadian influence,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve also got the drive to sleep.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the ways that I think</p>
<p>that can be best understood is</p>
<p>if somebody ever pulls an all-nighter,</p>
<p>they get tired around 11 or 12 or so,</p>
<p>and then very tired around 3, 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>but then even if you stay up,</p>
<p>sometime right around 7 or 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>your normal wake-up time, you start to feel alert again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the sleep drive is extremely strong,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a circadian rhythm</p>
<p>that drives wakefulness in the morning.</p>
<p>Okay, so those two are the components.</p>
<p>Before we get into the feeding component,</p>
<p>I want to talk about these direct effects of light on mood,</p>
<p>okay, Diego Fernandez&rsquo;s data,</p>
<p>and this perihabenular thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just, for the moment,</p>
<p>set aside the tri part of the tripartite model</p>
<p>and just focus on what are the direct effects</p>
<p>of light on mood?</p>
<p>And the way that I interpret what you&rsquo;ve said so far</p>
<p>is that the protocol that emerges from this,</p>
<p>if one is trying to optimize their mood,</p>
<p>is yes, see light, view light, I should say,</p>
<p>early in the day in order to set your circadian clock,</p>
<p>maybe also in the evening as well.</p>
<p>And of course, avoid light at night,</p>
<p>get it as dim as possible.</p>
<p>However, you said it&rsquo;s also a good idea</p>
<p>to get as much bright light during the day</p>
<p>as you safely can in order to improve your mood</p>
<p>independently of regulating your sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem where it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>as satisfying as the circadian,</p>
<p>is that as you know,</p>
<p>this brain region has been discovered very recently.</p>
<p>Habenula.</p>
<p>The perihabenular region.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known about it a long time,</p>
<p>but nobody knew what it did.</p>
<p>So we knew about the habenula,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why the name is confusing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not the habenula itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the perihabenular.</p>
<p>Oh, near the habenula.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s near the habenula.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just call it the Samar-Hatar nucleus?</p>
<p>I should have, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>Maybe because if you do that, it&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so for here ever after, the perihabenular nucleus,</p>
<p>we should probably call it the Hatar-</p>
<p>Hatar-Fernandez.</p>
<p>How about Hatar-Fernandez-Burson nucleus?</p>
<p>Okay, this is like nerdy science attribution stuff,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to call it the Hatar nucleus.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, line it up.</p>
<p>Okay, so this structure is taking light</p>
<p>and independent of sleep rhythms and circadian rhythms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s driving changes in mood.</p>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>Is this through the dopamine system, the serotonin system?</p>
<p>We still recently,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t identified this region very well.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what light does to it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how it interacts.</p>
<p>So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re working on this right now.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why I said, it&rsquo;s not satisfying.</p>
<p>This is like the function of sleep.</p>
<p>Why do we sleep?</p>
<p>We know sleep is very important to us,</p>
<p>but we still don&rsquo;t have a satisfying function</p>
<p>of why do we sleep, right?</p>
<p>We have hypotheses.</p>
<p>But the why questions, I think it&rsquo;s our good friend</p>
<p>and colleague at University of Washington,</p>
<p>Russ Van Gelder, who always says,</p>
<p>when somebody asks why, the best answer is just to say,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>None of us really know why.</p>
<p>No, but the point is, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have said why.</p>
<p>What is the function of sleep?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very hard to know.</p>
<p>Why would, what is the reason organisms have to go offline</p>
<p>for so long?</p>
<p>You know, people assume it&rsquo;s for repair.</p>
<p>Assume it&rsquo;s for learning and memory.</p>
<p>Assume all kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But there is really no clear function for sleeping.</p>
<p>There is no clear function for sleeping.</p>
<p>I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses.</p>
<p>I mean, all we know is that if you don&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>or your sleep is very fractured, you get messed up.</p>
<p>And you could die even, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really bad if you don&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know what is the function,</p>
<p>what is that sleep have done to organisms</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t have done with rest?</p>
<p>What if you just could rest without sleeping,</p>
<p>just sit down and rest?</p>
<p>Well, my lab&rsquo;s trying to figure out whether or not</p>
<p>these non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>can compensate for sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously sleep is better,</p>
<p>but many people are not getting the sleep that they need.</p>
<p>But okay, so, and if people are sensing</p>
<p>that Samer and I are about to start talking</p>
<p>over each other and arguing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always the goal when we talk, right?</p>
<p>Unlike other scientists I interact with,</p>
<p>when Samer and I get together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered a successful conversation</p>
<p>if we get into a big fight and then go for a big meal</p>
<p>where I pick the restaurant.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about food and eating and appetite.</p>
<p>You had yet another,</p>
<p>yes, I greatly admire your success in this way,</p>
<p>yet another incredible discovery</p>
<p>showing that there are direct, excuse me,</p>
<p>effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just summarize those results.</p>
<p>And honestly, that paper is the one</p>
<p>that allowed us to come with the tripartite model</p>
<p>because we were thinking completely wrong about it.</p>
<p>We wanted this experiment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be fun for your audience to hear</p>
<p>why we started this experiment.</p>
<p>Remember that when we discovered the IPRGCs,</p>
<p>we figured if they are the only relay</p>
<p>to entrain the circadian clock,</p>
<p>then you could kill them and have an animal</p>
<p>opposite to the one that we spoke,</p>
<p>or a human opposite to the one that we spoke about earlier,</p>
<p>where instead of having no pattern vision</p>
<p>and have circadian photoentrainment,</p>
<p>we could produce an animal that have pattern vision,</p>
<p>but no circadian photoentrainment.</p>
<p>So circadian blind.</p>
<p>Circadian blind, but pattern sighted.</p>
<p>And we succeeded in that.</p>
<p>The problem when you have these animals,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve told you many times already,</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t adjust to the day-night cycle.</p>
<p>So doing experiments on them become very complicated.</p>
<p>What is their behavior like if you don&rsquo;t have these cells?</p>
<p>Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep?</p>
<p>They just drift like the humans we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re in Las Vegas</p>
<p>with no clocks or watch, right?</p>
<p>They stay up later every night.</p>
<p>They come either, depends on their clock.</p>
<p>If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier.</p>
<p>If their clock is longer, they come in later.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really messed up.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t adjust to the,</p>
<p>if they were in the wild,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be eliminated in a second, right?</p>
<p>There is no way they&rsquo;ll survive.</p>
<p>So me and Diego started talking and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>what if we use non-light entraining agent?</p>
<p>And what is the strongest non-light entraining agent?</p>
<p>Food.</p>
<p>So we thought that the light defective animals</p>
<p>will have more sensitivity to food entrainment</p>
<p>because as you know more than me,</p>
<p>this is an area that you&rsquo;ve worked really well on.</p>
<p>For vision, if you&rsquo;re image blind,</p>
<p>your hearing and somatosensory get improved, right?</p>
<p>The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation.</p>
<p>But we found actually that if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the light system, actually you&rsquo;re feeding,</p>
<p>the food ability to entrain the animal</p>
<p>goes completely to the ground,</p>
<p>completely opposite to what we predicted.</p>
<p>So light viewing and feeding behavior</p>
<p>are interacting in ways that support one another.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we came with the tripartite model.</p>
<p>We figured it&rsquo;s different than sensation of the environment.</p>
<p>When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact,</p>
<p>but your vision is a real full modality.</p>
<p>You want to see, that&rsquo;s what vision want to do.</p>
<p>You want to hear, that&rsquo;s what hearing want to do.</p>
<p>You want to sense, that&rsquo;s what sensing want to do.</p>
<p>But for the circadian system, light, food,</p>
<p>all these entraining agent,</p>
<p>they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just assume if you remove light,</p>
<p>this one is going to be stronger.</p>
<p>No, they need to know each other&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The light informs when the animal&rsquo;s going to eat.</p>
<p>Well, what I like about this so much is that,</p>
<p>you know, in the other, in the world outside of science,</p>
<p>in which I don&rsquo;t really exist in,</p>
<p>but that I see a lot of this kind of wellness,</p>
<p>you know, stuff with this,</p>
<p>all this mind-body integration stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because people view the body</p>
<p>more as a system, right?</p>
<p>A system of organs that interact,</p>
<p>as opposed to the way that standard science</p>
<p>and medical profession is like,</p>
<p>you work on the liver or your ear, nose and throat,</p>
<p>or heart and lung or brain or-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way of thinking.</p>
<p>But the biology is integrated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So for somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in affecting their eating behavior,</p>
<p>something that you are familiar with</p>
<p>and that we will talk more about</p>
<p>your experiences of in a moment,</p>
<p>how should they use light</p>
<p>in order to adjust their eating behavior?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So now that I&rsquo;ve told you about all this interaction</p>
<p>between the different inputs to the circadian clock,</p>
<p>just, you think about it as an engineer,</p>
<p>what would be the best thing?</p>
<p>The best thing is to know</p>
<p>when your food times happen in the day,</p>
<p>when should you get light,</p>
<p>and when is your circadian clock in your system, right?</p>
<p>So if you eat at very specific times of the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another signal that is telling your body,</p>
<p>your clock, you&rsquo;re in a certain time of the day.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having lunch at the correct time every day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting bright light,</p>
<p>now you have two systems that are informing your clock,</p>
<p>your clock is going to be better.</p>
<p>So regular mealtimes.</p>
<p>Regular mealtimes that fit your circadian clock.</p>
<p>So, and in fact, if you do that,</p>
<p>when I started doing this,</p>
<p>and it helped me lose weight,</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m exposing myself</p>
<p>to the right amount of light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating at regular time.</p>
<p>It is amazing.</p>
<p>You will be not hungry, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you eat at noon.</p>
<p>You will not feel any hunger at 11.45,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden, the hunger jumps.</p>
<p>This is clearly not an energy issue</p>
<p>because it could not be that drastic.</p>
<p>No, the desire to eat is mainly driven by these cues,</p>
<p>these hormone cues that are very exquisitely timed</p>
<p>to sleep-wake cycle, but also to light.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And you know, in the wild,</p>
<p>you could imagine why energy level</p>
<p>through the arcuate nucleus-</p>
<p>I should explain to people what the arcuate is</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve done that adequately.</p>
<p>The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that drives hunger and feeding behavior.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re talking about is the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s taking cues from your viewing of light,</p>
<p>believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger.</p>
<p>And this is a non-trivial way in which your timing of hunger</p>
<p>and amount of hunger is regulated</p>
<p>by when and how much light you view.</p>
<p>So let me ask you a couple practical-</p>
<p>But can I just, this is really,</p>
<p>before you ask me, sorry, Andrew,</p>
<p>we said we&rsquo;re going to fight,</p>
<p>but to me is the interesting thing to think about it.</p>
<p>In the wild, when you didn&rsquo;t have the availability</p>
<p>of food that we have,</p>
<p>the arcuate plays a huge important role</p>
<p>because if you weren&rsquo;t successful in getting food,</p>
<p>then the arc is going to tell you,</p>
<p>look, you have to take risk and go get food</p>
<p>because your energy level is very low.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of great research about that.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s missing is the fact in humans,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting to a situation, most of us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting to a situation</p>
<p>where we have low energy levels.</p>
<p>Most of the time, actually, we eat,</p>
<p>not because we want to,</p>
<p>because we really have low energy,</p>
<p>but because we want to eat.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s why I feel that the timing</p>
<p>is very important for us</p>
<p>because we always have enough energy level for us to eat.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll eat just for the sensation of chewing.</p>
<p>I mean, I enjoy the taste too,</p>
<p>and I enjoy the social aspects when those are a part of it,</p>
<p>but I literally enjoy the physical act of chewing,</p>
<p>absolutely.</p>
<p>Which explains a lot.</p>
<p>Okay, so how regular are you,</p>
<p>or do you recommend people be about mealtimes?</p>
<p>Because what I&rsquo;m hearing is that light viewing behavior</p>
<p>is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day,</p>
<p>minimize it in the evening and at night, generally speaking,</p>
<p>for sake of mood and circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>But for sake of regulating timing and quality,</p>
<p>I should also say a food intake</p>
<p>because people clearly make better choices about food intake</p>
<p>when they are anticipating a meal</p>
<p>and they aren&rsquo;t constantly hungry.</p>
<p>And so the ability to regulate hunger</p>
<p>for particular phases of the circadian cycle</p>
<p>is quite valuable for all people,</p>
<p>not just people trying to lose weight, but all people.</p>
<p>Are we talking about down to the minute?</p>
<p>Like if I-</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>All right, so 12 noon is my normal lunch, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>plus or minus-</p>
<p>Half an hour.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>So eat around between 11.30 and 12.30.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the time.</p>
<p>And it depends if you also do multiple meals.</p>
<p>Remember, three meals,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a decision that somebody came up with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Nowadays, fewer people are doing that, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Given our friend Sachin Panda&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, so you could have two meals,</p>
<p>you could have very multiple meals</p>
<p>that are distributed across your active time.</p>
<p>I agree with Sachin Panda&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>that try to avoid eating</p>
<p>when your system is supposed to be relaxing,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re supposed to be at non-active time.</p>
<p>So limit your eating to the active time of your cycle.</p>
<p>And that seemed to be,</p>
<p>and Joe Takahashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this,</p>
<p>that seems to be incredibly important</p>
<p>for aspect of the circadian-</p>
<p>And for health.</p>
<p>And for health.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;re referring to Sachin Panda&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>He wrote a beautiful book called</p>
<p>The Circadian Code.</p>
<p>Maybe, Samer, with some luck, you&rsquo;ll write a book as well,</p>
<p>meaning the world would be lucky to have that book.</p>
<p>But Sachin&rsquo;s data really strongly point to the fact</p>
<p>that liver health, brain health,</p>
<p>metabolic factors and endocrine factors</p>
<p>of various systems and organs</p>
<p>all seem to benefit from having a period</p>
<p>of each 24-hour day in which we are not eating anything</p>
<p>and then eating at very regular meal times.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about eating and meal times</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s move a little bit away</p>
<p>from the science for the moment,</p>
<p>although we will return to it,</p>
<p>and talk a little bit more about your experience</p>
<p>with eating and meal times.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking in good shape lately.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been putting work into it.</p>
<p>We talk a lot and you&rsquo;ve been exercising</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been eating well, meaning quality food.</p>
<p>You just came back from Jordan</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m assuming the food is amazing.</p>
<p>Yes, the food is amazing.</p>
<p>And honestly, usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan,</p>
<p>but this time I didn&rsquo;t gain any weight,</p>
<p>which was really nice, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, when I met you,</p>
<p>you were probably about 100 pounds heavier</p>
<p>than you are now.</p>
<p>Yeah, 275 pounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 219 now, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>You had a lot of vigor then</p>
<p>and you have a lot of vigor now,</p>
<p>but I know that you undertook a very specific protocol</p>
<p>in order to lose the weight.</p>
<p>Based on your understanding of the circadian system</p>
<p>and of light and appetite and mood,</p>
<p>maybe you could just tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about what that schedule looks like.</p>
<p>And we realize that this is not a prescriptive</p>
<p>for everybody, but you found what worked for you.</p>
<p>Maybe just describe those changes.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I followed my circadian cycle, right?</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve talked about, right?</p>
<p>So I dimmed the light at night.</p>
<p>I slept at regular hours.</p>
<p>I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m really active and I&rsquo;m really hungry.</p>
<p>And at night when I avoid dinner</p>
<p>because my circadian system really shuts off at three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an early person.</p>
<p>Like you could give me anything I would eat before three.</p>
<p>After three, nothing appeals to me anymore.</p>
<p>My system is shut off.</p>
<p>What time are you going to sleep</p>
<p>and what time are you waking up?</p>
<p>Oh, so in my case, I should have put this out.</p>
<p>I mean, I go to sleep literally at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>I mean, I literally, five minutes after 9 p.m.,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely out.</p>
<p>And I wake up between 4.30 and 5 a.m.</p>
<p>So if I extend it, I go to 6 a.m.</p>
<p>But very rarely, it depends on how tired I was.</p>
<p>And that, as I recall, was an important set of changes</p>
<p>for you to be able to regulate your food intake.</p>
<p>Absolutely, because then I&rsquo;m having very big breakfast.</p>
<p>And again, for different people, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I have a big breakfast at 7 a.m. maximum.</p>
<p>So I have a big breakfast, coffee and all this stuff.</p>
<p>Then I have some simple snack around 10.</p>
<p>Then I have regular lunch at noon or between noon to one.</p>
<p>Then I have another snack at three.</p>
<p>And the hardest time to regulate the food</p>
<p>is between 12 and three.</p>
<p>This is when I really feel hungry all the time.</p>
<p>This is your equivalent of kind of late evening</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>So for me, it would probably be between seven and 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And then at night, I&rsquo;m completely not hungry.</p>
<p>But usually, as you said, the beauty,</p>
<p>the enjoyment of food, like when my wife cooks</p>
<p>some really beautiful Indian food, I eat,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not hungry.</p>
<p>And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight.</p>
<p>But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight.</p>
<p>So there is a combination of all these things</p>
<p>that help you adjust the input of food,</p>
<p>the input of light, the input of the clock,</p>
<p>and the drive to hunger.</p>
<p>Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that some people</p>
<p>are not hungry early in the day.</p>
<p>They might be late-shifted people,</p>
<p>in which case eating later in the day</p>
<p>will work well for them.</p>
<p>It will work, as long as they don&rsquo;t eat early</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, you have to work with your schedule,</p>
<p>with your active schedule.</p>
<p>Yeah, you and I have been talking about this offline</p>
<p>for years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re finally having this discussion publicly now.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about, really,</p>
<p>is finding your ideal sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And finding your ideal eating schedule.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And understanding how those two things interact.</p>
<p>And you know, the nice thing, as you said,</p>
<p>finding them out is going to help you</p>
<p>to understand how they interact,</p>
<p>because we know from the tripartite model</p>
<p>that they are all interconnected.</p>
<p>And for each person, they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>interconnected differently.</p>
<p>So for each person, you would, you know,</p>
<p>for me, if I exercise at night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to mess up my whole system.</p>
<p>Believe it.</p>
<p>So when do you exercise?</p>
<p>Morning. Morning works great for me.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Morning exercise for me works great.</p>
<p>I tried one time because it was easier for me</p>
<p>to exercise at night before I leave</p>
<p>when the traffic is there from the night,</p>
<p>and I think that messed me up</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t sleep well,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t wake up well,</p>
<p>and that led to more changes in my food.</p>
<p>I gained weight again, actually,</p>
<p>believe it or not, even though I was exercising.</p>
<p>So I think this really makes me think</p>
<p>that you have to think of the tripartite model</p>
<p>to see what is the best times</p>
<p>and what is the best interrelation</p>
<p>between the different components,</p>
<p>as you beautifully said,</p>
<p>between your meal times, your light exposure,</p>
<p>and your sleep, that works for you.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that.</p>
<p>Usually, Samer&rsquo;s insulting me today.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s complimenting me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to compliment him right back</p>
<p>by saying this is the first time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever really understood how,</p>
<p>yes, light can control sleep.</p>
<p>Yes, it can control mood.</p>
<p>Yes, it can impact feeding,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s really about doing the self-exploration</p>
<p>to align those in the way that works best.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m hearing, tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m hearing is that once you understand</p>
<p>what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>then you should exercise during the period of time</p>
<p>in which you feel most alert.</p>
<p>And if it works for your schedule,</p>
<p>ideally, you would also eat during the time</p>
<p>in which you feel most alert,</p>
<p>and then stop eating and stop light-viewing behavior</p>
<p>as you head towards sleep.</p>
<p>So the only thing I would say that complicates all of this,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes me sad, is your light exposure.</p>
<p>Mine personally?</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>The people&rsquo;s light exposure, right?</p>
<p>This is what complicates it,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to be able to figure all this out</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re shifting yourself out of your comfort zone</p>
<p>by viewing light at the wrong time of the day.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say if you were under an idle natural conditions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a person who would sleep later than me,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say will sleep at midnight and wake up at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t eat anything till noon,</p>
<p>and as you said, you eat late in the evening.</p>
<p>Then this would be perfect for you.</p>
<p>But now see what happens</p>
<p>if now you include the light component.</p>
<p>Now if you push your sleep from midnight to 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re waking up in the morning,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re actually really not the morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waking up, sorry, at noon instead of 8 o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>and the time where you&rsquo;re not supposed to be hungry,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re going to start eating directly at noon</p>
<p>or something like that, or even delay it.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re shifting your whole cycle,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know if this interaction</p>
<p>between your sleep, feeding,</p>
<p>and the light-dark environment</p>
<p>are still going to be maintained or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem that people have.</p>
<p>You know, as I&rsquo;m hearing this,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m realizing is most of us, probably me included,</p>
<p>are messing up at least one,</p>
<p>two, or three of these components.</p>
<p>But that the probe,</p>
<p>the way to figure out what&rsquo;s right for oneself</p>
<p>is to start manipulating light exposure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to be honest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m biased because I believe that light</p>
<p>is the strongest time-giver.</p>
<p>And a lot of people disagree.</p>
<p>Some people think feeding is.</p>
<p>I always thought that light was the primary zeitgeber,</p>
<p>the primary-</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of people think it&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>A lot of people even sometimes mention social interactions.</p>
<p>They read the literature?</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>I mean, my understanding is that light</p>
<p>is the most powerful driver</p>
<p>of the things we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think we need to regulate this first,</p>
<p>and everything else fits.</p>
<p>And you know, the nice thing is that</p>
<p>your sleep-wake cycle and exercise</p>
<p>tell you really bluntly if you&rsquo;re doing it right or not.</p>
<p>Tell me more about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you more.</p>
<p>I shifted my exercise.</p>
<p>Honestly, things fell apart like never before.</p>
<p>When you moved from exercising early in the day</p>
<p>to late in the day?</p>
<p>Yeah, it completely fell apart for me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy exercise at night.</p>
<p>My pain tolerance for exercise wasn&rsquo;t as good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking with N equals one, and I&rsquo;m aware of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tested this empirically.</p>
<p>But at least to me, it really messed up everything.</p>
<p>I started having problems</p>
<p>because my body temperature would go up,</p>
<p>and that will affect my sleep.</p>
<p>I possibly was running in the gym</p>
<p>with a lot of lights,</p>
<p>so maybe the light was a component.</p>
<p>But for me, exercising in the morning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much better for me.</p>
<p>But a lot of people can&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>of exercising in the morning.</p>
<p>So it depends on when you feel comfortable</p>
<p>in your sleep-wake cycle and your exercise.</p>
<p>I think that tells you if your system</p>
<p>is in synchrony with one another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re good friends.</p>
<p>Our friend Pat Dossett, right, that we both know,</p>
<p>you know, did nine years in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s one of these people,</p>
<p>says, you know, he&rsquo;s happy to go for a run or swim</p>
<p>anytime between 4.30 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll train in the afternoon too</p>
<p>because, you know, he&rsquo;s a SEAL team guy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do whatever anytime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the phenotype.</p>
<p>But he feels best doing that, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a mid, I like to exercise mid-morning,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m happy to skip eating until 12 or 1.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And I like to go to sleep around 11, 30, 12</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a normal human being rather than you</p>
<p>who goes to bed at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>What about Pat, actually?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never asked him what time.</p>
<p>So Pat&rsquo;s ideal to sleep time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked him this, would be around 8.30 or 9.</p>
<p>Oh, sounds like Pat.</p>
<p>No, but he has, yes, but he has two young children,</p>
<p>two years old and a newborn,</p>
<p>and so the cycle is disrupted, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s known, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the effect of childbearing,</p>
<p>and I think we could talk about this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more complicated, but that&rsquo;s pretty much, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name</p>
<p>for chronotype because chronotype implies</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just about sleep and wake,</p>
<p>being an early bird or a night owl,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re also talking about is how exercise</p>
<p>and eating match on to those.</p>
<p>And the phase relation between them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the phases between different components, as you said.</p>
<p>Because they interact.</p>
<p>Because they interact.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have to be in the same phase,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say my light and food</p>
<p>could be very close to each other&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>your light and food could be different, right?</p>
<p>The phases don&rsquo;t have to be, they can be plastic,</p>
<p>so you have to find this for yourself.</p>
<p>You may be a person who eats late at night,</p>
<p>exercises late at night,</p>
<p>or you may be a person who exercise early, eat later,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t, as long as the phase is good,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you have to find out.</p>
<p>Okay, and if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about phase relationship,</p>
<p>it means you want to lump exercise, feeding, and light for-</p>
<p>And sleep.</p>
<p>And sleep in a way that as a coherent and total system</p>
<p>makes you feel really good.</p>
<p>Temporally in a great order.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I could tell you, to me,</p>
<p>is literally getting exposed to sun,</p>
<p>clearly in the morning, clearly at noon,</p>
<p>I go out, I keep my windows in the office completely open,</p>
<p>eating mostly in the early time of the day,</p>
<p>and exercising, and literally at the end part of the day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally in a more thoughtful, vegetative state.</p>
<p>Like I really can&rsquo;t, like after five,</p>
<p>I tell my students,</p>
<p>if you want to tell me anything complicated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wasting your time.</p>
<p>My brain just doesn&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>So even though I only sleep at night,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really starting to shut off, ramp down,</p>
<p>really, I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I could send email, talk about brainless stuff,</p>
<p>but my power, my energy to do powerful stuff</p>
<p>really dropped tremendously.</p>
<p>So all my students who know me very well,</p>
<p>they put the meetings with me early in the morning</p>
<p>because they know this is when I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>so everything for me, and for me, is very tight,</p>
<p>so it could be different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clustered in the morning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all tied together,</p>
<p>and literally the remaining part seems to be just a,</p>
<p>you know, vegetative state.</p>
<p>Yeah, you and my bulldog, Costello,</p>
<p>who unfortunately passed away recently,</p>
<p>had that in, yeah.</p>
<p>I did not, that&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sam and Costello were good friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry to break it to you here.</p>
<p>Yeah, he had a good long life and he went easy,</p>
<p>but he had a circadian clock</p>
<p>that basically would just sleep around 24 hours a day,</p>
<p>minimal activity interspersed every third day or so.</p>
<p>You do have this morning vigor.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think other people</p>
<p>are gonna have more of an afternoon vigor.</p>
<p>Do you think that this can change across the lifespan?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, the rumor is that teenagers</p>
<p>naturally want to sleep in later and stay up later.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s social rhythm</p>
<p>or do you think that that&rsquo;s actually biological?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be both.</p>
<p>One thing that worries me is that it seems</p>
<p>that if anything with age,</p>
<p>this morning rigor gets stronger.</p>
<p>You mean you want people to become more of morning people?</p>
<p>More of morning people.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Because for me, I&rsquo;m already a very shifted morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be one of these 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. sleepers</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, on the other hand, it&rsquo;s also kind of nice</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s quiet and you can get work done.</p>
<p>Yeah, but honestly, from 4.30 till 7.30</p>
<p>when my wife wake up, it can be very long.</p>
<p>Yes, you achieve a lot, but it&rsquo;s quiet outside.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to be at 1 a.m.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>You can tell Samer is more social than I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>But we should touch on that actually.</p>
<p>So your wife, she follows a different schedule.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so the social rhythm is important.</p>
<p>I think what should we do?</p>
<p>How should we conceptualize?</p>
<p>And how should we adjust ourselves</p>
<p>according to the social rhythm?</p>
<p>And I honestly love this hypothesis</p>
<p>that people came up with.</p>
<p>And Pat&rsquo;s kids reminded me of.</p>
<p>Because kids are really gonna disrupt your sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>it seems like there is a chrono attraction</p>
<p>that usually people who attract each others</p>
<p>have actually different sleep-wake schedule.</p>
<p>And the idea being is that this allows them</p>
<p>to take care of their kids throughout the day-night cycle.</p>
<p>And have a peaceful marriage.</p>
<p>And have a peaceful marriage in a way, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, we didn&rsquo;t have kids, me and Reggie,</p>
<p>so maybe this is, but it seems like evolutionary,</p>
<p>it makes sense that if you wanna protect your kids,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want everybody to be morning rigor</p>
<p>and then the kids don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>so you want the distributed across.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonable argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that one of the reasons</p>
<p>that people think that the clock is not exactly 24 hours,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s 24 hours plus or minus 20 minutes or so,</p>
<p>is because we believe that we evolved in clans</p>
<p>or groups, villages, whatever,</p>
<p>that were about 100 to 200 people.</p>
<p>And in order to have protection</p>
<p>around the early morning hours</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re vulnerable to predation,</p>
<p>and in the late night hours</p>
<p>that you would want some individuals of our species</p>
<p>to be naturally more like night owls</p>
<p>and some more like early people.</p>
<p>So your theory of parenting is similar in that way.</p>
<p>The social rhythm is a powerful rhythm though.</p>
<p>Meaning, if I go out and I&rsquo;m tired,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m tired at like 9.30,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go out,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m in a meeting.</p>
<p>So can I just say something about that?</p>
<p>I think the social rhythm is powerful</p>
<p>at the obvious levels,</p>
<p>like it affects your sleep,</p>
<p>it affects how much you wake up or eat,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not so sure it&rsquo;s as powerful</p>
<p>as people think on the clock.</p>
<p>Now, eventually it will mess up the clock</p>
<p>because now if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of social at night,</p>
<p>getting enough light,</p>
<p>eating at the wrong time of the day,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;re going to have an effect.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the social interactions themselves</p>
<p>have been shown to affect your clock very strongly</p>
<p>for some reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>Well, for people hearing this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably getting the impression</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m the night owl</p>
<p>and then Samer is the one that&rsquo;s in bed at nine</p>
<p>and then wakes up at four.</p>
<p>But having attended many meetings with Samer,</p>
<p>I can tell you that he&rsquo;s the party animal.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s talk about the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re the partier who&rsquo;s up until two</p>
<p>dancing at these various meetings,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually a good dancer, I&rsquo;m told.</p>
<p>But what should we do when we do stay up very late</p>
<p>for whatever reason?</p>
<p>Could be because we had to take a midnight trip</p>
<p>to the hospital, the unfortunate reason,</p>
<p>or it could be because you&rsquo;re in the presence of people</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see very often</p>
<p>and you go out for a really nice night out on the town</p>
<p>and you get to sleep around 2.30 or three in the morning.</p>
<p>How should one get back on schedule?</p>
<p>Do you force yourself to then get up and view light</p>
<p>at the normal time that you would get up and view light</p>
<p>or do you allow yourself to sleep in?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the optimal protocol?</p>
<p>I would allow myself to sleep in</p>
<p>and remember, this is a long-term effect.</p>
<p>This is something that you live with for a long period.</p>
<p>And remember, I told you about the experiments we did</p>
<p>with the mood.</p>
<p>These require two weeks of that light schedule</p>
<p>to cause mood disturbances.</p>
<p>So these don&rsquo;t happen just in a single day.</p>
<p>So this is the way you justify staying out late</p>
<p>every once in a while?</p>
<p>In the meetings you&rsquo;ve seen me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done this for five or six days continuously,</p>
<p>but what you didn&rsquo;t see that when I came back to my home,</p>
<p>it took me two weeks as if I did a jet lag.</p>
<p>So I really do suffer for two weeks</p>
<p>after doing a six crazy night of staying up at night,</p>
<p>drinking at the wrong time of the day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m completely okay with it.</p>
<p>When I go back, everything goes back.</p>
<p>It takes me actually literally two weeks to recover</p>
<p>from the circadian rhythm meeting</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen me partying at some point.</p>
<p>Which is kind of ironic, the circadian rhythm meeting.</p>
<p>People are totally disrupting the circadian cycle,</p>
<p>but scientists are human beings too.</p>
<p>So I think if you do it at very little occasions,</p>
<p>I think you should not worry too much</p>
<p>that this will have a lasting impact.</p>
<p>And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule,</p>
<p>you could come back to it.</p>
<p>The problem is when you maintain these wrong schedule</p>
<p>for prolonged time, it becomes chronic,</p>
<p>prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you have the problems</p>
<p>and the accumulation of the problems.</p>
<p>So when you have sleeping problem,</p>
<p>you produce metabolic problem.</p>
<p>When you have metabolic problems,</p>
<p>you produce lack of exercise.</p>
<p>And you could see how things can spiral out very quickly.</p>
<p>And then it would be hard to come back to it.</p>
<p>Well, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of</p>
<p>and a cause of almost all mental health disorders.</p>
<p>And certainly the metabolic syndromes</p>
<p>that people are talking about nowadays</p>
<p>and all of this, it all funnels back to light.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s so remarkable.</p>
<p>And so we have these devices and I use my phone</p>
<p>and I use my computer,</p>
<p>but do you think that the mere dimming of the screen</p>
<p>or not interacting with screens after,</p>
<p>with say 90 minutes or two hours before bedtime,</p>
<p>according to what we&rsquo;re saying today,</p>
<p>this should have a profound effect on all these.</p>
<p>And I really believe it does.</p>
<p>Again, I think as Pat has did these inventions</p>
<p>where you get a pouch,</p>
<p>where you put your phone in a pouch.</p>
<p>So what Samer is referring to is our friend, Pat,</p>
<p>this former SEAL Team member</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a very impressive person</p>
<p>in the landscape of business and family, et cetera.</p>
<p>Real, a superhuman by any regard</p>
<p>has this habit of taking his phone</p>
<p>and putting it into a sealed pouch in the evening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically-</p>
<p>And in his program,</p>
<p>he sends you actually these seal, you know, patches.</p>
<p>And so that I think is a great idea</p>
<p>because not only it will take away the light from you,</p>
<p>but it also take away the distraction</p>
<p>because you wanna repair and recover and sleep does that.</p>
<p>And if you have your phone dinging all the time</p>
<p>or the light flashing from it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re just not getting enough sleep</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re causing yourself major problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never asked you this,</p>
<p>but I realized now that I should have long ago,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll ask you now,</p>
<p>why and how did you get into all this stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, honestly, I, first of all,</p>
<p>I wanted to become a, you know,</p>
<p>I wanted to study genetics</p>
<p>and I knew I wanted to do PhD in genetics,</p>
<p>but I only got accepted in one university at the time</p>
<p>and I joined the learning and memory lab.</p>
<p>And I liked learning and memory at the beginning.</p>
<p>I worked on the snails and Aplasia californica</p>
<p>and started looking at learning and memory.</p>
<p>But then the same lab was looking at these daily variation.</p>
<p>I was really struck.</p>
<p>Like you never think about it outside of science.</p>
<p>It really struck me</p>
<p>that organisms can measure day biologically.</p>
<p>That was very shocking to me.</p>
<p>And I just really got attracted</p>
<p>and I wanted to see why does this happen?</p>
<p>What is the effect of different times of day?</p>
<p>And I just stuck with it.</p>
<p>It was mind blowing for me who was in medical school</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never heard about it before.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>Medicine, I think still now,</p>
<p>we are very good at looking at stuff spatially,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re very bad at looking at temporal aspects.</p>
<p>So we always like to see images, static images,</p>
<p>spatial information.</p>
<p>Take an x-ray, measure a temperature,</p>
<p>measure a blood pressure.</p>
<p>Exactly, but we don&rsquo;t think of temporal.</p>
<p>And, you know, you talk to John Huganash right now</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling you the importance of chronomedicine</p>
<p>or chronopharmac, whatever the word is.</p>
<p>And it really just getting the drugs</p>
<p>at the right time of the day</p>
<p>is gonna be essential for our health.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s gonna come from using better trackers</p>
<p>like aura rings, whoop straps, these kinds of things?</p>
<p>I love the trackers,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s even more exciting discoveries.</p>
<p>Now you could take a single blood sample</p>
<p>and measure many biological components</p>
<p>and figure where you are in the circadian clock,</p>
<p>something that was very hard to do before.</p>
<p>So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock,</p>
<p>you could actually understand more the effect of everything,</p>
<p>exercise, feeling, light input.</p>
<p>What is the marker?</p>
<p>So there are some papers from, what&rsquo;s her name,</p>
<p>Phyllis Z. and from Achim Kramer,</p>
<p>where they measure multiple RNAs that are known to tell you</p>
<p>what phase of the clock is,</p>
<p>or multiple proteins or biological reactions.</p>
<p>And depending on a combination of factor,</p>
<p>not a single factor,</p>
<p>you could tell where you are in the circadian clock.</p>
<p>So they could, instead of just measuring temperature</p>
<p>or melatonin, just one measurement,</p>
<p>and melatonin specifically is also complicated</p>
<p>by the fact that melatonin is affected by light.</p>
<p>And temperature, your temperature and sleep</p>
<p>can be easily dissociatable, right?</p>
<p>When you travel across different times on your sleep</p>
<p>at different times in the temperature cycle.</p>
<p>So having multiple components measured</p>
<p>will give you a better determination of your circadian phase</p>
<p>and understanding your circadian phase in humans</p>
<p>will tell you what is the effect of giving certain drugs</p>
<p>at certain times of the circadian phase.</p>
<p>So in the future, this is gonna be studied</p>
<p>at a much higher level when you can determine the phase</p>
<p>in relation to all the other stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking to me that in all animals, besides humans,</p>
<p>if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure</p>
<p>to light and light-dark cycle,</p>
<p>they essentially don&rsquo;t mate and or die and or get killed off.</p>
<p>But in humans, we are able to override that</p>
<p>at least to some extent.</p>
<p>But the ways in which we suffer</p>
<p>appear to be things like obesity, metabolic syndromes,</p>
<p>reproductive syndromes that accompany the other syndromes,</p>
<p>you know, endocrine syndromes</p>
<p>and mood and depressive disorders.</p>
<p>Is there any effort at the level of the nationally</p>
<p>or laboratories that you&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>to try and use light in order to improve mood</p>
<p>and mental health?</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, this is my moonshot.</p>
<p>This is the thing that I think people,</p>
<p>because I say, don&rsquo;t take a pill, take a photon.</p>
<p>I mean, you take pills, it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making it that really,</p>
<p>we have an opportunity right now</p>
<p>with the incredible advances of LED lights,</p>
<p>of changing spectra of light, of regulating intensities.</p>
<p>And just for simple changes,</p>
<p>you could really improve sleep-wake cycle, productivity,</p>
<p>and still you could actually get more done</p>
<p>because as we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>when you have all these messed up,</p>
<p>now you have to sleep more,</p>
<p>but your sleep is fragmented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very good.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t focus when you need to do it.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t focus when you don&rsquo;t have alertness</p>
<p>when you need the alertness.</p>
<p>So having all these,</p>
<p>you could allow you to do even more actually</p>
<p>at the end than less.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the exciting part of it.</p>
<p>One of the questions I get asked most often about</p>
<p>is about ADHD.</p>
<p>You know, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of self-prescribed</p>
<p>as well as clinically prescribed ADHD.</p>
<p>People are having a tremendously difficult time focusing</p>
<p>and not just because they&rsquo;re sleepy,</p>
<p>they just can&rsquo;t seem to anchor their attention.</p>
<p>And there could be multiple reasons for this,</p>
<p>but there are now several clinical trials ongoing</p>
<p>using light to try and anchor people&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>and mood and wellbeing for sake of focus.</p>
<p>And I think that while I love this saying that you mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, take a photon, not a pill,</p>
<p>and with due respect to the need for pharmacology</p>
<p>for certain people,</p>
<p>I think most people just haven&rsquo;t really dialed in</p>
<p>their relationship to light in a way that allows them</p>
<p>to rule out whether or not they need medication.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to put it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t add to that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about jet lag,</p>
<p>but not in the context of, okay,</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s traveling from Europe to Japan</p>
<p>or from the East Coast,</p>
<p>because that varies tremendously, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s as many different variations on travel</p>
<p>as there are individuals out there</p>
<p>and with goals and jobs, et cetera.</p>
<p>But rather let&rsquo;s talk about what are the two or three things</p>
<p>that people can do to adjust their schedule quickly.</p>
<p>Yesterday I called you and said, look,</p>
<p>I know somebody who&rsquo;s traveling six hours.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even mention in which direction,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want people to anchor to that example.</p>
<p>And you described some very simple tools of viewing light</p>
<p>a little bit earlier than normal</p>
<p>and getting on the local food schedule, et cetera,</p>
<p>that would allow them to shift more quickly.</p>
<p>And the reason I want to have this conversation is yes,</p>
<p>for the travelers and for the shift workers,</p>
<p>but mostly because of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve proven again and again</p>
<p>that people are disrupted</p>
<p>in their circadian behavior at home.</p>
<p>So what are the, aside from what we&rsquo;ve already talked about,</p>
<p>how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule?</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say fall classes are starting,</p>
<p>you start a new job or you have a baby</p>
<p>or a puppy or whatever.</p>
<p>What is the best way to shift the clock quickly?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very simple as we&rsquo;ve talked yesterday.</p>
<p>So imagine you&rsquo;re in the outside</p>
<p>with no environmental, with no industrial light.</p>
<p>If your body thinks you&rsquo;re in early evening</p>
<p>and you see a bright light, what does this tell you?</p>
<p>Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early afternoon or late afternoon.</p>
<p>So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon.</p>
<p>So if you get light early in the evening,</p>
<p>it delays your clock.</p>
<p>So what does-</p>
<p>That makes you wanna go to sleep later.</p>
<p>Yes, it delays your clock.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in New York, right?</p>
<p>People in Italy have an advanced clock</p>
<p>because they are six hours ahead of us.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in New York</p>
<p>and you get light early in the evening,</p>
<p>you delay even further from Italy.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re delaying away from Italy.</p>
<p>Now the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you thought dawn came up</p>
<p>and you thought it&rsquo;s already dawn,</p>
<p>but it was, let&rsquo;s say three o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>And then you get a bright light</p>
<p>and you say, oh, wait a minute,</p>
<p>dawn is not up yet.</p>
<p>So I should advance my clock.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m at night, but I&rsquo;m getting bright light.</p>
<p>So I should run because dawn is already up.</p>
<p>So then later in the night, later in your night,</p>
<p>and actually it just happens that in humans,</p>
<p>you get a temperature in the deer later in the night,</p>
<p>low temperature in your body.</p>
<p>After that, lights start advancing your clock.</p>
<p>So if you want to go to Italy,</p>
<p>instead of getting light early in the evening,</p>
<p>you want to get light after the temperature low.</p>
<p>So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re catching up to the Italians just by using light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>So you could do it for every region.</p>
<p>You could calculate how much they are advanced of you.</p>
<p>You could know how much these light shifts happen per day.</p>
<p>And you can calculate what you need to do,</p>
<p>very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going from New York to California,</p>
<p>you want to delay your clock,</p>
<p>or advancing if you&rsquo;re going from New York to Italy.</p>
<p>So in order to make that a visual,</p>
<p>and because a lot of people are listening to this,</p>
<p>not looking at it on video,</p>
<p>we will put a zero cost downloadable figure of this</p>
<p>on the hubermanlab.com website related to this episode.</p>
<p>But I think I can summarize it in language as well.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, what you&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>if your typical wake up time is say 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>then your low point in temperature</p>
<p>probably occurs somewhere around 5 a.m.</p>
<p>And if you view light right around then,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to essentially advance your clock.</p>
<p>Yeah, because then your body thinks,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>so advance your clock by one to two hours.</p>
<p>But if I were to view light, say at 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>then it would probably delay my clock.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and then let&rsquo;s say I land in a new schedule.</p>
<p>I want to adjust to a new schedule.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I didn&rsquo;t manage to do anything</p>
<p>with my light viewing before I went,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the trip.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I&rsquo;m on a new schedule, okay?</p>
<p>I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock</p>
<p>and to avoid gastrointestinal issues</p>
<p>is to eat on the local schedule,</p>
<p>to start basically behaving like a local,</p>
<p>even though your circadian clock</p>
<p>will take a little bit of time to catch up.</p>
<p>Absolutely, but you have to remember the light, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, now that we explained it very simply,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a very simple example, right?</p>
<p>New York to Italy, that&rsquo;s a simple example.</p>
<p>New York time, Italy time, six-hour difference, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you fly from New York at night.</p>
<p>You reach Italy at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>What is the time in your New York time?</p>
<p>Although you reach-</p>
<p>Six hours back.</p>
<p>Six hours back. It&rsquo;s 2 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2 a.m.</p>
<p>So when you land Italy,</p>
<p>you want to avoid light like the plague.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could eat,</p>
<p>but you really don&rsquo;t want to get a light.</p>
<p>Because otherwise it&rsquo;s gonna delay you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna delay you, it&rsquo;s gonna send you to California</p>
<p>instead of sending you to Italy.</p>
<p>Right, and so this is such a key point.</p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s confused about this,</p>
<p>we will put some diagrams up.</p>
<p>But what Sam was saying is so crucial.</p>
<p>Just because getting bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>early in the day is really beneficial when you&rsquo;re at home.</p>
<p>When you travel to a new time zone,</p>
<p>you have to take into account what your body thinks,</p>
<p>what, excuse me, you have to take into account</p>
<p>where your body thinks you are.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re looking at the Italian sunrise,</p>
<p>having just flown from New York to Italy,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t prepare for that trip</p>
<p>by waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation-</p>
<p>Multiple days, yeah.</p>
<p>And you view light at 6 or 7 a.m. Italian time,</p>
<p>beautiful Italian sunrise,</p>
<p>you are going to delay your clock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to basically throw yourself back to California,</p>
<p>but you are in Italy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna throw your biology back to California,</p>
<p>and you are gonna be up in the middle of the Italian night,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be-</p>
<p>Miserable.</p>
<p>Miserable.</p>
<p>And it took, because I called Samer in desperation.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi,</p>
<p>NYU Abu Dhabi, to give a seminar.</p>
<p>12 hours out of phase, it&rsquo;s a 12-hour flip.</p>
<p>And I thought I could just muscle it.</p>
<p>I thought, I&rsquo;ll get up, just view sunlight</p>
<p>when the sun comes up.</p>
<p>And I fell apart mentally and physically.</p>
<p>And Samer came to my rescue.</p>
<p>I called him.</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And he said, go to the gym at the local dawn,</p>
<p>work out, eat, and then view sunlight starting the next day.</p>
<p>And that basically got me onto schedule.</p>
<p>So I used food and exercise to adjust myself</p>
<p>because my light viewing activity</p>
<p>was just completely out of whack.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and we talked about other details,</p>
<p>so you have to calculate it, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very important to avoid getting</p>
<p>the wrong light information when you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to adjust your body, because otherwise,</p>
<p>it shifts to the other side.</p>
<p>Absolutely right.</p>
<p>Well, you are one of these people that has such vigor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these things where,</p>
<p>having known you all these years,</p>
<p>you have a tremendous capacity for work</p>
<p>and for soccer and for arguing, respectful arguing.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse with the age.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we could talk about that offline.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of your vigor</p>
<p>and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus</p>
<p>and really do so many things at an impressive level</p>
<p>is because you think about these issues</p>
<p>and you think about when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be optimal for focus,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to be optimal for exercise,</p>
<p>and the when is the key.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people live in the landscape</p>
<p>of feeling like there&rsquo;s something broken inside them</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t focus or they can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subconscious, right?</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s all subconscious, these effects.</p>
<p>And Anouk, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Now, honestly, joking aside about age,</p>
<p>I really agree with you that I think part of the reason</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to be able to do this,</p>
<p>that I really think about it</p>
<p>and I make sure that I keep everything aligned.</p>
<p>And that actually helps me a lot.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t suffer in sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suffer in waking up.</p>
<p>I never use a timer to wake up.</p>
<p>I mean, people say, aren&rsquo;t you scared?</p>
<p>Like, you have to give a lecture at eight or 7.30.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you scared?</p>
<p>I was like, there is no way I&rsquo;m going to go beyond that.</p>
<p>It just, even if I try, I can&rsquo;t sleep beyond 6 a.m.</p>
<p>in my regular times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>By 4.30, my eyes are wide awake and I&rsquo;m in bed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, system is so aligned.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>A lot of times people will say, how come I go to sleep?</p>
<p>I fall asleep fine, but then I wake up at three or four</p>
<p>in the morning and can&rsquo;t fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Is it possible that those people were supposed to go</p>
<p>to bed at 8 p.m.?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, it is possible.</p>
<p>It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up</p>
<p>and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, it is possible.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s possible that their clock is completely misaligned,</p>
<p>that they are getting maybe a nap time at night</p>
<p>when they are supposed, and then they possibly feel</p>
<p>so sleepy in the day.</p>
<p>So all these are possible combinations.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting idea I hadn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<p>So what they think is their sleep,</p>
<p>their body is so out of whack with the light-dark cycle</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually a nap.</p>
<p>Or the weaker part of the sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, you see this when you travel</p>
<p>to different time zones before you adjust.</p>
<p>You go to sleep really well,</p>
<p>but two hours later, you&rsquo;re fully up.</p>
<p>Two hours.</p>
<p>If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re gonna wake up in two hours.</p>
<p>So then you feel very sleepy later in the day</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So it depends of how your whole system</p>
<p>is aligned to the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting idea.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna resonate with a lot of people.</p>
<p>I wake up every morning around three or four,</p>
<p>I generally use the bathroom</p>
<p>and then I fall back asleep very deeply.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people obsess over that waking up</p>
<p>and worry there&rsquo;s something wrong.</p>
<p>Provided they can go back to sleep, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If you can go use the bathroom, go back to sleep,</p>
<p>that should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Maybe some people, when they go to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>they use very bright light</p>
<p>and then they get an alerting signal.</p>
<p>So if you, maybe that could be as simple as that,</p>
<p>that affects you.</p>
<p>Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light</p>
<p>or you start reading your iPad.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these combination</p>
<p>that we still don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>that could be affecting their sleep wake rhythms</p>
<p>and their sleep maintenance.</p>
<p>Do you use melatonin?</p>
<p>Do you take melatonin?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need it, to be honest.</p>
<p>In my case, there is no reason to use it</p>
<p>because I could guarantee you</p>
<p>that by maybe eight o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>my melatonin has already started to go up.</p>
<p>And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t use a lot of lights after sunset.</p>
<p>And light inhibits melatonin.</p>
<p>And light really blocks melatonin level.</p>
<p>You hear this myth that the pineal gland calcifies</p>
<p>as we get older.</p>
<p>Is that, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard about that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what does,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s not very clear evidence</p>
<p>that affects the sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about it, to be honest.</p>
<p>The evidence that I&rsquo;ve seen is that,</p>
<p>yes, there&rsquo;s some calcification around the pineal</p>
<p>just because of where it sits in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s close to some bony structures.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any evidence</p>
<p>that it has negative effects.</p>
<p>I mean, if you still have,</p>
<p>you could measure melatonin</p>
<p>and that should tell you if it has,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>I think this is more of a internet wellness thing</p>
<p>that got outside the cage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It sounds terrible, calcification of the thing, right?</p>
<p>The heart thing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about seasonality a little bit.</p>
<p>I learned, and I don&rsquo;t know if this is still true,</p>
<p>but that most suicides occur in April, in the spring.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a poem that says April is the cruelest month.</p>
<p>I think it is, the poem begins.</p>
<p>Are there data that suicides are more frequent</p>
<p>at particular times of year?</p>
<p>And if so, is the spring that time of year?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, a lot of people talk about this.</p>
<p>And one of the hypothesis is that the winter months</p>
<p>that are very bad for mood</p>
<p>make people not wanting to do anything.</p>
<p>And they get into such deep level of depression</p>
<p>that when the sun comes up,</p>
<p>they get actually the energy to act on their depression,</p>
<p>which sounds really terrible.</p>
<p>And it is terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea that the lack of light</p>
<p>throughout the winter</p>
<p>caused them to go into such depression</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t feel like doing anything.</p>
<p>Then when the light comes in with rigor in the spring,</p>
<p>it gives them that, after all the depression they suffered,</p>
<p>gives them that push to take that sad final act, I guess.</p>
<p>What other seasonal effects</p>
<p>have been demonstrated in humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think in humans, it&rsquo;s not very clear</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t think about seasonality.</p>
<p>But if you start thinking about us,</p>
<p>I think we go through major seasonal changes.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think our eating pattern change across the year.</p>
<p>I could tell you that me thinking about this,</p>
<p>there is a clear changes that happens to me</p>
<p>across the year.</p>
<p>But for animals, this is really essential</p>
<p>because for animals,</p>
<p>they have to time their mating behavior</p>
<p>with when they deliver their progeny</p>
<p>in the most abundant amount of food.</p>
<p>And artificial light is causing major disruption</p>
<p>because if you change the way these animals</p>
<p>are receiving the light information,</p>
<p>they either start mating much earlier or much later</p>
<p>and their numbers dwindle</p>
<p>and they get into the dangers</p>
<p>of really completely getting eliminated or extinct.</p>
<p>Well, human birth rates are definitely going down.</p>
<p>I mean, in the U.S. In some areas, not others.</p>
<p>But are there other effects of seasonality on humans</p>
<p>that we are aware of?</p>
<p>Honestly, you could see it perfectly, I think,</p>
<p>in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>I mean, you could talk to people who live in-</p>
<p>Sure, they get seasonal depression.</p>
<p>Seasonal depression is one,</p>
<p>but actually when you start asking them questions,</p>
<p>they tell you like in the winter,</p>
<p>they barely could wake up,</p>
<p>they barely have the energy.</p>
<p>Before even depression,</p>
<p>even people who don&rsquo;t get seasonal depression,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you our energy level is lower,</p>
<p>our ability to go to work is not the same.</p>
<p>And in the summer,</p>
<p>most people actually sleep very little.</p>
<p>They tell you we really can,</p>
<p>we feel like we&rsquo;re manic,</p>
<p>we have all this energy.</p>
<p>And not in a negative way, in a funny way, right?</p>
<p>I mean, but if we want to sleep,</p>
<p>we have to put this curtain.</p>
<p>I think in these situations,</p>
<p>you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans.</p>
<p>I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t get exposed to that much natural light.</p>
<p>We have all this artificial light.</p>
<p>But I think, honestly,</p>
<p>one of the things that is going to happen</p>
<p>if they follow your recommendations</p>
<p>about giving light at the same time,</p>
<p>giving food, giving exercise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, those are your recommendations.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just, fair attribution.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that this is going to cause them</p>
<p>to also experience some changes across the season</p>
<p>because now they&rsquo;re going to see the sun differently.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go out in the morning,</p>
<p>in the summer, you&rsquo;re going to get a much brighter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the change in time.</p>
<p>I know people think, oh, because you&rsquo;re biased.</p>
<p>Because I think-</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry, the change in time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about daylight savings?</p>
<p>Daylight savings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a bad idea</p>
<p>because it disrupts that rhythm that you&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>Because I think your body, if you keep that rhythm,</p>
<p>you will see the whole seasonality.</p>
<p>And I look at it from a different aspect than other people.</p>
<p>It really, and people say I&rsquo;m biased</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a morning person.</p>
<p>And it may be true, but there&rsquo;s situation-</p>
<p>Secret conspiracy about morning people.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there is, if you think about it, Andrew,</p>
<p>there is a situation where you&rsquo;re getting light</p>
<p>perfectly well, and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>they delay it by one hour because,</p>
<p>and then even though it&rsquo;s the summer,</p>
<p>your body now, if you&rsquo;re still not adjusting,</p>
<p>think, oh, wait, what happened?</p>
<p>What kind of happened?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re bringing this up</p>
<p>because I always thought, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>
<p>One hour, right?</p>
<p>One hour shift, you know, spring forward, fall back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to adjust to one hour action.</p>
<p>But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one hour.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one hour across that one day,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this cumulative effect on the clock</p>
<p>and these three elements of your tripartite model.</p>
<p>Right, the homeostatic sleep</p>
<p>and the light direct effects on mood.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s so close, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard</p>
<p>to figure out how to adjust it perfectly</p>
<p>because, you know, we&rsquo;re already sleep deprived</p>
<p>in our society.</p>
<p>And then you shift it by, you know,</p>
<p>so it just, it all accumulates and it has no benefit.</p>
<p>Well, you work at a major government organization,</p>
<p>National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we get a campaign for-</p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying, why don&rsquo;t we go campaign?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes no sense</p>
<p>to have the summer light goes up at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>The light goes down where I live in Baltimore at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>when you really want to see the light longer in the day,</p>
<p>you now shift the other way.</p>
<p>And now it goes all of a sudden at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Why do you do these drastic changes?</p>
<p>Well, let it blend across the whole season.</p>
<p>Yes, later, earlier at night,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at least consistent.</p>
<p>It goes in a very consistent manner.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand why they do this.</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Well, I think that the reason they do it</p>
<p>is because they don&rsquo;t understand the biology.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Because one hour seems trivial</p>
<p>unless you understand the repercussions</p>
<p>of that one hour shift.</p>
<p>Because what&rsquo;s also clear now,</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>is that that one hour shift</p>
<p>is taking you out of alignment</p>
<p>with the natural light-dark cycle</p>
<p>in exactly the wrong direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pushing people to get even later in the summer</p>
<p>when light is going to push you later anyway.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>You put it beautifully.</p>
<p>I just rambled and this is-</p>
<p>No, no, you made it clear.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like literally it made you,</p>
<p>it made people who are having problem</p>
<p>having an advanced sleep rhythm</p>
<p>because they are delayed.</p>
<p>Now you give them this hour</p>
<p>to make them even more delayed.</p>
<p>You push them even later in the day-night cycle.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>I think 2022 should be the year</p>
<p>that we abolish daylight savings.</p>
<p>That would be the day for me, honestly.</p>
<p>Well, also if it has a positive effect</p>
<p>on what is essentially an epidemic</p>
<p>of mental health issues</p>
<p>and other issues related to improper interactions</p>
<p>with light, that I think is a well worthwhile cause</p>
<p>and we can explore it.</p>
<p>So for once, we&rsquo;re going to fight with another group.</p>
<p>A common battle as opposed to with one another.</p>
<p>I mean, the circadian people, honestly,</p>
<p>to give them credit,</p>
<p>have been trying for years to abolish daylight saving.</p>
<p>Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>and wake up at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>so we never see them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, the circadian community has done an amazing job</p>
<p>of figuring out what we need.</p>
<p>And then the challenge, of course,</p>
<p>is making sure that people get what they need</p>
<p>and making sure that at a societal level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not vaulting ourself into the wrong direction.</p>
<p>And the biggest problem is that the late waking people,</p>
<p>they think that really,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to try to put it in a better way now,</p>
<p>they think, oh, because you&rsquo;re a morning person,</p>
<p>you want to see the sun early,</p>
<p>so you want me to suffer it dropping late.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the case because what happens</p>
<p>is when they shift it back after the daylight saving,</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re going to make you suffer really badly</p>
<p>because now it&rsquo;s going to be earlier.</p>
<p>In the fall when there&rsquo;s not enough light,</p>
<p>if they keep it the same way.</p>
<p>So try to convince them that actually this at the end</p>
<p>causes more trouble when you need the light</p>
<p>for your late schedule in the fall when they shift it back.</p>
<p>Then they say, keep it daylight saving all the time.</p>
<p>And that has been proven.</p>
<p>That is very bad.</p>
<p>Like people have done studies</p>
<p>that literally two areas close to each other</p>
<p>and areas that were the whole year on daylight saving</p>
<p>has much more problems,</p>
<p>even in cancer rates and depression.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what trying to convince people</p>
<p>that you need to prevent that switch</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need daylight saving at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the problem happens.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I had not thought about that,</p>
<p>but yes, you late risers in the fall,</p>
<p>when you fall back, as they say, spring forward,</p>
<p>fall back, you dial back the clock,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really compounding the problem that already exists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really nice if you think if you keep it consistent</p>
<p>in the spring, you get the equinox</p>
<p>and then the days start going up.</p>
<p>And then even in the summer start going down</p>
<p>and then the fall, you get the other equinox and go back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very symmetrical, right?</p>
<p>It goes into short day, longer,</p>
<p>long, long, long, then short day again.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re getting these bumps in both sides</p>
<p>of the spring and fall.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Something that is beautifully symmetrical,</p>
<p>beautifully smooth, you&rsquo;re putting bumps into it.</p>
<p>Well, and we, not just beautiful because it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>but evolved.</p>
<p>I mean, essentially this is the system we evolved in</p>
<p>for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Even apart from the exact equator,</p>
<p>every part of the earth have seasonality.</p>
<p>I want to briefly touch on something,</p>
<p>which is individual and genetic variation</p>
<p>in sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>So not chronotype,</p>
<p>but first of all, a very basic question.</p>
<p>Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes,</p>
<p>are they more sensitive to light</p>
<p>than people with darker pigmented eyes?</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, it makes sense they will be more</p>
<p>because if you think of my dark pupil,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s blocking more light.</p>
<p>So if you have light pupil,</p>
<p>yes, for vision, it may not be very obvious,</p>
<p>but for something that is measuring the amount of light,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting more light than me.</p>
<p>So you probably need less light</p>
<p>to be effective as somebody who&rsquo;s darker.</p>
<p>And that maybe could explain</p>
<p>why sometimes lighter people say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into very bright conditions</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really bright.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t even be at a cafe</p>
<p>with one of these reflective tables, like a metal table,</p>
<p>unless I have very dark sunglasses on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bright, it&rsquo;s painful for me.</p>
<p>Whereas some people like you,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sat outside and had meals and you&rsquo;re like, fine.</p>
<p>I assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness versus, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the pupil blocks more light.</p>
<p>So I think it is possible that it&rsquo;s as simple</p>
<p>as the pupil blocking more light can have sensitivity.</p>
<p>But your question is also goes deeper.</p>
<p>Are there more sensitivity differences?</p>
<p>And my understanding would be,</p>
<p>I would think that it may be,</p>
<p>it depends on how effective your cells are</p>
<p>in responding to light, how healthy your IPRGCs are.</p>
<p>So I would, but there&rsquo;s not many studies to show that.</p>
<p>What is really clear that is happening</p>
<p>is that patients with bipolar,</p>
<p>they seem to have different sensitivities to light.</p>
<p>So it seems that at least people</p>
<p>who have psychological changes,</p>
<p>they may have differences to the sensitivity of light.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Where are those differences in a particular direction?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to, we can look it up.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and people have heard me say this ad nauseum</p>
<p>to the point where they actually roll their eyes,</p>
<p>but you know that these are the only two pieces of brain,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m pointing to my eyes, folks,</p>
<p>that are outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>They are two pieces of brain</p>
<p>that basically inform the brain</p>
<p>about whether or not to be alert or asleep.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But you can imagine that those two little pieces of brain</p>
<p>that we call eyes would have genetic variations.</p>
<p>Of course, eye color is genetically,</p>
<p>modular, is that determined,</p>
<p>that there would be genetic variations</p>
<p>based on whether or not your ancestry evolved</p>
<p>near the equator or further from the equator, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia</p>
<p>than you do at the equator.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I mean, it&rsquo;s the lack of light</p>
<p>that said you need less inhibition</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not enough light, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea of the change in color.</p>
<p>So yeah, I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later</p>
<p>and will be empirically determined.</p>
<p>The problem we have in this field right now,</p>
<p>which I think is the biggest problem,</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t have a way to measure</p>
<p>the IPRGC sensitivities in humans.</p>
<p>So we still, like, it&rsquo;s easy to measure</p>
<p>your rot cone function if you go to an optometrist,</p>
<p>they measure all the details, right?</p>
<p>Contrast detection.</p>
<p>You look at the chart, you look at the SNLN chart,</p>
<p>you look at the letters of the DMV, yeah.</p>
<p>But for the non-subconscious,</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t have a good measuring systems</p>
<p>to figure out what is Andrew&rsquo;s sensitivity?</p>
<p>What is Samer&rsquo;s sensitivity?</p>
<p>What is this person&rsquo;s sensitivity?</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re starting to work on something like that</p>
<p>to hopefully develop these techniques.</p>
<p>But till we develop them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to figure out</p>
<p>if there is a sensitivity difference,</p>
<p>how do they relate on men and women,</p>
<p>you know, dark and light,</p>
<p>and all the, you know, normal versus psychologically</p>
<p>effect and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And every time you talk, I learn so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, in the best way,</p>
<p>the best sense of the term,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a waterfall of knowledge.</p>
<p>As a final question,</p>
<p>I have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the sensitivity to spicy food.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I&rsquo;m asking this question,</p>
<p>what seemingly out of the blue,</p>
<p>is that I made the mistake once</p>
<p>of having Samer cook for me,</p>
<p>and I said, not too spicy.</p>
<p>And he said, okay, not too spicy.</p>
<p>He actually said, okay, not too spicy.</p>
<p>And it almost killed me.</p>
<p>Like, it was like two or three days.</p>
<p>So you know a lot about biology</p>
<p>outside the visual system, light, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been around a while.</p>
<p>Are there known genetic or inherited</p>
<p>of any kind sensitivities to spicy food,</p>
<p>to things like red peppers and capsaicin?</p>
<p>Because what you call mild,</p>
<p>my friend, almost put me into the hospital.</p>
<p>I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean,</p>
<p>and I need to develop the pain tolerance.</p>
<p>Okay, true, true.</p>
<p>I like cold water swims, and Samer&rsquo;s not a fan.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s adaptable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my belief.</p>
<p>Before I met Reji, I was like you.</p>
<p>And once I started eating a lot of spicy food,</p>
<p>I lost touch of how spicy my food is.</p>
<p>So I nearly killed you, Andrew,</p>
<p>and I apologize for that.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>So basically what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that marriage toughened you up.</p>
<p>Toughened me up, exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the solution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Samer, this has been an amazing march</p>
<p>through the importance of light,</p>
<p>not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness,</p>
<p>but also for food timing,</p>
<p>the interactions with mood,</p>
<p>the interactions with exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that people are going to start thinking</p>
<p>about how to change their relationship with light</p>
<p>as a way to anchor everything that they do,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s important to their health.</p>
<p>And I just, on behalf of all of them,</p>
<p>and just directly from me as your friend</p>
<p>and as a colleague for many years now,</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you</p>
<p>for the incredible work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and for sharing it with us.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>And actually, now thinking about all of this,</p>
<p>and you said I should write a book,</p>
<p>I should write a book and call it The Tripartite Model.</p>
<p>I think that would put all these components together,</p>
<p>would be very interesting to do at some point.</p>
<p>You should write a book.</p>
<p>You should write.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably try and change the title</p>
<p>to like Food, Mood, and You, you know,</p>
<p>or something because,</p>
<p>but you can put in little print</p>
<p>on The Tripartite Model or whatever.</p>
<p>But regardless of what it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>you absolutely should write a book.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;d like Samer to write a book,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about him,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about where people can find you.</p>
<p>Your laboratory is</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>He is head of the Chronobiology Unit,</p>
<p>all these things that I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But you are active on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what is your Twitter handle?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at Samer Hattar.</p>
<p>And we will provide a link for that in the show notes.</p>
<p>Sorry, yes, at the Twitter, at Samer Hattar.</p>
<p>And I think the same for Instagram.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually.</p>
<p>And Samer has been coaxed onto Instagram.</p>
<p>So he does post from time to time,</p>
<p>mostly pictures of food that is incredibly spicy,</p>
<p>but also information about chronobiology.</p>
<p>He comes on for an Instagram Live</p>
<p>every once in a while with me.</p>
<p>And so definitely give him a follow there and on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that he&rsquo;ll be happy to answer questions</p>
<p>and entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah, and light.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great, thank you, Samer.</p>
<p>Awesome, thank you, Andrew.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my conversation</p>
<p>with Dr. Samer Hattar.</p>
<p>I hope you found it as interesting</p>
<p>and informative as I did.</p>

<p>and other related topics</p>
<p>by going to hubermanlab.stanford.edu slash giving.</p>
<p>And there you can make a tax deductible donation</p>
<p>at any level that you like.</p>
