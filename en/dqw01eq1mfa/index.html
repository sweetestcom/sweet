metabolism let&amp;rsquo;s go through them one by one number one age yes age slows your metabolism primarily through a decrease in growth hormone now the good news is there&amp;rsquo;s things that you can do to increase growth hormone the most powerful thing is fasting and when you do fasting you have the potential to increase growth hormone by 2 000 percent the second most powerful thing that can increase growth hormone is exercise but the exercise has to be intense one of the best exercises to increase growth hormone out of anything is sprinting it&amp;rsquo;s probably the most painful but short burst of high intensity with lots of rest as in high intensity interval training is very very powerful to increase growth hormone number two menopause if you&amp;rsquo;re female and you&amp;rsquo;re over the age of 50 51 52 you know exactly what i&amp;rsquo;m talking about as you go through menopause something happens you have a shift the ovaries go into retirement and the adrenal glands act as a backup to the ovaries and so what happens is you get a spike in cortisol a lot of times when you go through menopause the body tends to fall apart because of this high level of cortisol that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s very very important to take care of the adrenals right before you go through menopause and also during and after of course but i have a lot of videos on on what to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going through menopause and i&amp;rsquo;ll put those links down below number three history of pregnancies going through a pregnancy not only creates a lot of trauma on a female body but it raises estrogen and estrogen is a fat making hormone if you wanted to help regulate estrogen you want to consume things like cruciferous vegetables there&amp;rsquo;s some products out there one being dim which is a concentrated cruciferous vegetable but you want to avoid things that increase estrogen like dairy and flax seeds both of those can increase estrogen and of course the big one would be soy too so that&amp;rsquo;s number three all right number four history of dieting the more you have went on a diet the harder it is to lose weight down the road because what happens is you create an adaptation by the body to slow down the metabolism so dieting incorrectly especially when you&amp;rsquo;re cutting calories and you&amp;rsquo;re you&amp;rsquo;re keeping your carbs high very very bad so keeping your calories filled with nutrients just eating less frequently intermittent fasting not cutting calories though that&amp;rsquo;s not the best way to do it so just so you know just to prevent the slowdown of metabolism you want to keep your nutrients very very high and not eat frequently and definitely do not go in a low fat diet because you need that fat to support the endocrine system number five a history of doing high carb diets what happens is you start generating something called insulin resistance and when you have insulin resistance you have a high level of insulin which is a thing that&amp;rsquo;s going to completely block down your ability to lose weight to fix insulin resistance and lower insulin you just need to watch my videos i have hundreds of videos on this one topic i&amp;rsquo;ll put some links down below number six chronic stress you can look at stress as consuming sugar and that&amp;rsquo;s really what it is because it turns things in your body to glucose yeah so stress is like eating sugar and i have a lot of videos on what to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going through a lot of chronic stress and how to reverse that all right number seven hypothyroidism ninety percent of all hypothyroidism is hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s that relates to the immune system it&amp;rsquo;s not really a thyroid problem it&amp;rsquo;s an immune system that&amp;rsquo;s usually caused by some problem in your gut so if you have hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s you should definitely be on a probiotic you should be taking selenium which is a very powerful antioxidant you should also be taking the vitamin d to drop the inflammation the other versions of hypothyroidism involve having a problem with too much estrogen because as you increase estrogen you shut the thyroid down also 80 of the thyroid hormone t4 gets converted to t3 the active form through the liver with the help of bile so if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a gallbladder if you have a fatty liver where you&amp;rsquo;re not making enough bile you need to start taking bile salts that will help you convert t4 to t3 all right number eight a fatty liver i just mentioned the liver helping you convert t4 to t3 but a fatty liver can definitely slow down the ability to lose weight from many different angles because if that liver is fatty you&amp;rsquo;re not going to have the ability to regulate certain levels of cortisol estrogen insulin and growth hormones so a fatty liver can definitely keep you stuck i recommend choline as well as getting on healthy keto and doing fasting because you can reverse a fatty liver number nine obesity the problem with that is the more fat you have the more estrogen you&amp;rsquo;re going to make and estrogen can keep you fat so over time as you lose more fat it&amp;rsquo;s going to be easier to lose weight because you don&amp;rsquo;t have that estrogen that&amp;rsquo;s countering your ability to lose weight there are three hormones cortisol estrogen and insulin that have the ability to block the seven fat burning hormones okay so it&amp;rsquo;s very important that we focus on those number 10 snacking frequent eating is the biggest killer to your metabolism because every time you eat you stimulate insulin these people do that are going on a diet and they&amp;rsquo;re having these small frequent meals oh they&amp;rsquo;re going to have a heck of a time with their metabolism all right number 11 regular consumption of alcohol i know this might be very unpopular but when you consume a little wine here and there unfortunately that wine not only has carbohydrates but it can really block the liver&amp;rsquo;s ability to help you tap into burning fat developing ketones so let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a glass of wine tonight don&amp;rsquo;t expect to burn fat for 48 hours now if you drink more wine that could go up to 72 hours so if you&amp;rsquo;re doing this like every other day or every third day it could be the reason why you&amp;rsquo;re not losing weight early childhood infections this relates to the person who said that they were always overweight and then you ask them well what about when you&amp;rsquo;re two years old they might say well i was skinny i was saying i&amp;rsquo;ll say what age did you start gaining weight they might say four what happened just before that well a lot of times they&amp;rsquo;ll say they had an infection a sinus infection asthma or some type of problem that involved taking a drug a steroid an antibiotic or an inhaler or some type of medication that somehow influenced your metabolism and they started getting fat ever since that so i&amp;rsquo;m just pointing out because a person can have an alteration in their metabolism very early on and a lot of times you don&amp;rsquo;t connect the dots so that could be a problem and the last thing and this is actually really important a lot of people are on medications and i&amp;rsquo;m not telling you to get off your medications but maybe you want to get with your doctor and come up with the solution so the dependency on medication is a lot less prednisone steroids anti anxiety antidepressant medication antibiotics all will increase weight gain and it can slow your metabolism down all right now the question is what do you do to speed it up for that check out this video

<p>﻿so i isolated about 13 things that have the 
potential to slow down your metabolism let&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>go through them one by one number one age yes 
age slows your metabolism primarily through  </p>
<p>a decrease in growth hormone now the 
good news is there&rsquo;s things that you  </p>
<p>can do to increase growth hormone 
the most powerful thing is fasting  </p>
<p>and when you do fasting you have the potential 
to increase growth hormone by 2 000 percent  </p>
<p>the second most powerful thing that can increase 
growth hormone is exercise but the exercise has to  </p>
<p>be intense one of the best exercises to increase 
growth hormone out of anything is sprinting  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the most painful but short burst 
of high intensity with lots of rest as in high  </p>
<p>intensity interval training is very very powerful 
to increase growth hormone number two menopause  </p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re female and you&rsquo;re over the age of 50 
51 52 you know exactly what i&rsquo;m talking about  </p>
<p>as you go through menopause something happens you 
have a shift the ovaries go into retirement and  </p>
<p>the adrenal glands act as a backup to the ovaries 
and so what happens is you get a spike in cortisol  </p>
<p>a lot of times when you go through menopause 
the body tends to fall apart because of this  </p>
<p>high level of cortisol that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very 
very important to take care of the adrenals  </p>
<p>right before you go through menopause and also 
during and after of course but i have a lot of  </p>
<p>videos on on what to do if you&rsquo;re going through 
menopause and i&rsquo;ll put those links down below  </p>
<p>number three history of pregnancies going 
through a pregnancy not only creates a  </p>
<p>lot of trauma on a female body but it raises 
estrogen and estrogen is a fat making hormone  </p>
<p>if you wanted to help regulate estrogen you want 
to consume things like cruciferous vegetables  </p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some products out there one being dim 
which is a concentrated cruciferous vegetable  </p>
<p>but you want to avoid things that increase 
estrogen like dairy and flax seeds  </p>
<p>both of those can increase estrogen and of 
course the big one would be soy too so that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>number three all right number four history 
of dieting the more you have went on a diet  </p>
<p>the harder it is to lose weight down the road 
because what happens is you create an adaptation  </p>
<p>by the body to slow down the metabolism so 
dieting incorrectly especially when you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>cutting calories and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re keeping your 
carbs high very very bad so keeping your calories  </p>
<p>filled with nutrients just eating less frequently 
intermittent fasting not cutting calories though  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the best way to do it so just so you 
know just to prevent the slowdown of metabolism  </p>
<p>you want to keep your nutrients very very high 
and not eat frequently and definitely do not go  </p>
<p>in a low fat diet because you need that fat 
to support the endocrine system number five  </p>
<p>a history of doing high carb diets 
what happens is you start generating  </p>
<p>something called insulin resistance and when you 
have insulin resistance you have a high level of  </p>
<p>insulin which is a thing that&rsquo;s going to 
completely block down your ability to lose  </p>
<p>weight to fix insulin resistance and lower insulin 
you just need to watch my videos i have hundreds  </p>
<p>of videos on this one topic i&rsquo;ll put some links 
down below number six chronic stress you can look  </p>
<p>at stress as consuming sugar and that&rsquo;s really 
what it is because it turns things in your body  </p>
<p>to glucose yeah so stress is like eating sugar 
and i have a lot of videos on what to do if you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>going through a lot of chronic stress and how to 
reverse that all right number seven hypothyroidism  </p>
<p>ninety percent of all hypothyroidism is 
hashimoto&rsquo;s that relates to the immune system  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a thyroid problem it&rsquo;s an immune 
system that&rsquo;s usually caused by some problem in  </p>
<p>your gut so if you have hashimoto&rsquo;s you should 
definitely be on a probiotic you should be taking  </p>
<p>selenium which is a very powerful antioxidant you 
should also be taking the vitamin d to drop the  </p>
<p>inflammation the other versions of hypothyroidism 
involve having a problem with too much estrogen  </p>
<p>because as you increase estrogen you shut the 
thyroid down also 80 of the thyroid hormone  </p>
<p>t4 gets converted to t3 the active form 
through the liver with the help of bile  </p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder if you have a 
fatty liver where you&rsquo;re not making enough bile  </p>
<p>you need to start taking bile 
salts that will help you convert  </p>
<p>t4 to t3 all right number eight a fatty liver 
i just mentioned the liver helping you convert  </p>
<p>t4 to t3 but a fatty liver can definitely 
slow down the ability to lose weight  </p>
<p>from many different angles because if that liver 
is fatty you&rsquo;re not going to have the ability to  </p>
<p>regulate certain levels of cortisol estrogen 
insulin and growth hormones so a fatty liver can  </p>
<p>definitely keep you stuck i recommend choline as 
well as getting on healthy keto and doing fasting  </p>
<p>because you can reverse a fatty liver number nine 
obesity the problem with that is the more fat you  </p>
<p>have the more estrogen you&rsquo;re going to make 
and estrogen can keep you fat so over time as  </p>
<p>you lose more fat it&rsquo;s going to be easier to lose 
weight because you don&rsquo;t have that estrogen that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>countering your ability to lose weight there 
are three hormones cortisol estrogen and insulin  </p>
<p>that have the ability to block the seven fat 
burning hormones okay so it&rsquo;s very important  </p>
<p>that we focus on those number 10 snacking 
frequent eating is the biggest killer  </p>
<p>to your metabolism because every time you 
eat you stimulate insulin these people do  </p>
<p>that are going on a diet and they&rsquo;re having these 
small frequent meals oh they&rsquo;re going to have a  </p>
<p>heck of a time with their metabolism all right 
number 11 regular consumption of alcohol i know  </p>
<p>this might be very unpopular but when you consume 
a little wine here and there unfortunately that  </p>
<p>wine not only has carbohydrates but it can really 
block the liver&rsquo;s ability to help you tap into  </p>
<p>burning fat developing ketones so let&rsquo;s say you 
have a glass of wine tonight don&rsquo;t expect to burn  </p>
<p>fat for 48 hours now if you drink more wine that 
could go up to 72 hours so if you&rsquo;re doing this  </p>
<p>like every other day or every third day it 
could be the reason why you&rsquo;re not losing weight  </p>
<ol start="12">
<li>early childhood infections this relates to the 
person who said that they were always overweight  </li>
</ol>
<p>and then you ask them well what about when you&rsquo;re 
two years old they might say well i was skinny  </p>
<p>i was saying i&rsquo;ll say what age did you start 
gaining weight they might say four what happened  </p>
<p>just before that well a lot of times they&rsquo;ll say 
they had an infection a sinus infection asthma or  </p>
<p>some type of problem that involved taking a drug 
a steroid an antibiotic or an inhaler or some  </p>
<p>type of medication that somehow influenced your 
metabolism and they started getting fat ever since  </p>
<p>that so i&rsquo;m just pointing out because a person can 
have an alteration in their metabolism very early  </p>
<p>on and a lot of times you don&rsquo;t connect the dots 
so that could be a problem and the last thing and  </p>
<p>this is actually really important a lot of people 
are on medications and i&rsquo;m not telling you to get  </p>
<p>off your medications but maybe you want to get 
with your doctor and come up with the solution so  </p>
<p>the dependency on medication is a lot less 
prednisone steroids anti anxiety antidepressant  </p>
<p>medication antibiotics all will increase weight 
gain and it can slow your metabolism down all  </p>
<p>right now the question is what do you do to 
speed it up for that check out this video right</p>
<p>here</p>
