    <p>The following is a conversation with Bob Langer, professor at</p>
<p>MIT, and one of the most cited researchers in history,</p>
<p>specializing in biotechnology fields of drug delivery systems</p>
<p>and tissue engineering. He has bridged theory and practice by</p>
<p>being a key member and driving force in launching many</p>
<p>successful biotech companies out of MIT. This conversation was</p>
<p>recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. His</p>
<p>research and companies are at the forefront of developing</p>
<p>treatment for COVID 19, including a promising vaccine</p>
<p>candidate. Quick summary of the ads to sponsors cash app and</p>
<p>masterclass. Please consider supporting the podcast by</p>

<p>You have a bit of a love for magic. Do you see a connection</p>
<p>between magic and science?</p>
<p>I do. I think magic can surprise you. And, uh, you know, and I</p>
<p>think science can surprise you. And there&rsquo;s something magical</p>
<p>about, about science. I mean, making discoveries and things</p>
<p>like that. Yeah. So on the, and then on the magic side, is</p>
<p>there some kind of engineering scientific process to the tricks</p>
<p>themselves? Do you see, cause there&rsquo;s a duality to it. One is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the, um, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re sort of the person inside that</p>
<p>knows how the whole thing works, how the universe of the magic</p>
<p>trick works. And then from the outside observer, which is kind</p>
<p>of the role of the scientists, you, the people that observe</p>
<p>the magic trick don&rsquo;t know at least initially anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on. Do you see that kind of duality?</p>
<p>Well, I think the duality that I see is fascination. You know,</p>
<p>I think of it, you know, when I watch magic myself, I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>fascinated by it. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a puzzle to think how it&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>but just the sheer fact that something that you never thought</p>
<p>could happen does happen. And I think about that in science too,</p>
<p>you know, sometimes you, it&rsquo;s something that, that you might</p>
<p>dream about and hoping to discover, maybe you do in some</p>
<p>way or form.</p>
<p>What is the most amazing magic trick you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s one I like, which is called the invisible pack.</p>
<p>And the way it works is you have this pack and you hold it up.</p>
<p>Well, first you say to somebody, this is invisible and this deck</p>
<p>and you say, well, shuffle it. They shuffle it, but you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of make believe. And then you say, okay, I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>you to pick a card, any card and show it to me. And you show it</p>
<p>to me and I look at it. And let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s the three of</p>
<p>hearts. I said, we&rsquo;ll put it back in the deck. But what I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like you to do is turn it up upside down from every other</p>
<p>card in the deck. So they do that imaginary. And I say,</p>
<p>do you want to shuffle it again? And they shuffle it. And I said,</p>
<p>well, so there&rsquo;s still one card upside down from every other</p>
<p>card in the deck. I said, what is that? And they said, well,</p>
<p>three hearts. So what just so happens in my back pocket, I</p>
<p>have this deck, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a real deck. I show it to</p>
<p>you and I just open it up. And there&rsquo;s just one card upside</p>
<p>down. And it&rsquo;s the three of hearts.</p>
<p>And, and you can do this trick.</p>
<p>I can, if I don&rsquo;t, I would have probably brought it.</p>
<p>All right. Well, beautiful. Let&rsquo;s get into the, into the</p>
<p>science. As of today, you have over 295,000 citations. An H</p>
<p>index of 269. You&rsquo;re one of the most cited people in history and</p>
<p>the most cited engineer in history. And yet nothing great,</p>
<p>I think is ever achieved without failure. So the interesting</p>
<p>part, what rejected papers, ideas, efforts in your life or</p>
<p>most painful, or had the biggest impact on your life?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of rejection too,</p>
<p>you know, but I suppose one way I think about this is that when</p>
<p>I first started, and this certainly had an impact both</p>
<p>ways, you know, I first started, we made two big discoveries and</p>
<p>they were kind of interrelated. I mean, one was, I was trying to</p>
<p>isolate with my postdoctoral advisor, Judah Folkman,</p>
<p>substances that could stop blood vessels from growing and nobody</p>
<p>had done that before. And so that was part A, let&rsquo;s say part B</p>
<p>is we had to develop a way to study that. And what was</p>
<p>critical to study that was to have a way to slowly release</p>
<p>those substances for, you know, more than a day, you know, maybe</p>
<p>months. And that had never been done before either. So we</p>
<p>published the first one we sent to Nature, the journal, and they</p>
<p>rejected it. And then we sent it, we revised it, we sent it to</p>
<p>Science and they accepted it. And the other, the opposite</p>
<p>happened, we sent it to Science and they rejected it. And then</p>
<p>we sent it to Nature and they accepted it. But I have to tell</p>
<p>you, when we got the rejections, it was really upsetting. I</p>
<p>thought, you know, I&rsquo;d done some really good work. And Dr.</p>
<p>Folkman thought we&rsquo;d done some really good work. And, and, but</p>
<p>it was very depressing to, you know, get rejected like that.</p>
<p>If you can linger on just the feeling or the thought process</p>
<p>when you get the rejection, especially early on in your</p>
<p>career, what, I mean, you don&rsquo;t know, now people know you as a</p>
<p>brilliant scientist, but at the time, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re full of</p>
<p>self doubt. And did you believe that maybe this idea is actually</p>
<p>quite terrible, that it could have been done much better? Or</p>
<p>is there underlying confidence? What was the feelings?</p>
<p>Well, you feel depressed and I felt the same way when I got</p>
<p>grants rejected, which I did a lot in the beginning. I guess</p>
<p>part of me, you know, you have multiple emotions. One is being</p>
<p>sad and being upset and also being maybe a little bit angry</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t feel the reviewers didn&rsquo;t get it. But</p>
<p>then as I thought about it more, I thought, well, maybe I just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t explain it well enough. And you know, that, you know,</p>
<p>that you go through stages. And so you say, well, okay, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>explain it better next time. And certainly you get reviews and</p>
<p>when you get the reviews, you see what they either didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t understand. And then you try to incorporate that into</p>
<p>your next versions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given advice to students to do something big, do</p>
<p>something that really can change the world rather than something</p>
<p>incremental. How did you yourself seek out such ideas? Is</p>
<p>there a process? Is there a sort of a rigorous process? Or is it</p>
<p>more spontaneous?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more spontaneous. I mean, part of its exposure to things,</p>
<p>part of its seeing other people, like I mentioned, Dr. Folkman,</p>
<p>he was my postdoctoral advisor, he was very good at that, you</p>
<p>could sort of see that he had big ideas. And I certainly met a</p>
<p>lot of people who didn&rsquo;t. And I think you could spot an idea</p>
<p>that might have potential when you see it, you know, because it</p>
<p>could have very broad implications, whereas a lot of</p>
<p>people might just keep doing derivative stuff. And so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>Systematically, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>So in the space of ideas, how many are just when you see them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just magic. It&rsquo;s something that you see that could be</p>
<p>impactful if you dig deeper.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s sort of hard to say because there&rsquo;s multiple levels</p>
<p>of ideas. One type of thing is like a new, you know, creation</p>
<p>that you could engineer tissues for the first time or make</p>
<p>dishes from scratch on the first time. But another thing is</p>
<p>really just deeply understanding something. And that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>too. So and that may lead to other things. So sometimes you</p>
<p>could think of a new technology, or I thought of a new</p>
<p>technology. But other times, things came from just the</p>
<p>process of trying to discover things. So it&rsquo;s never and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily know, like people talk about aha moments,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve, I mean, I certainly feel like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had some ideas that I really like. But it&rsquo;s taken me a long</p>
<p>time to go from the thought process of starting it to all of</p>
<p>a sudden, knowing that it might work.</p>
<p>So if you take drug delivery, for example, is the notion is</p>
<p>the initial notion, kind of a very general one, that we should</p>
<p>be able to do something like this. And then you start to ask</p>
<p>the questions of Well, how would you do it and then and then</p>
<p>digging and digging and digging?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right. I think it depends. I mean, there are</p>
<p>many different examples. The example I gave about delivering</p>
<p>large molecules, which we used to study these blood vessel</p>
<p>inhibitors. I mean, there, we had to invent something that</p>
<p>would do that. But other times, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s really understanding what goes on in</p>
<p>terms of understanding the mechanisms. And so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a single thing. And there are many different parts</p>
<p>to it, you know, over the years, we&rsquo;ve invented different or</p>
<p>discovered different principles for aerosols for delivering,</p>
<p>you know, genetic therapy agents, you know, all kinds of</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explore some of the key ideas you&rsquo;ve touched on in your</p>
<p>life. Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. Okay. So first, let me</p>
<p>ask, how complicated is the biology and chemistry of the</p>
<p>human body from the perspective of trying to affect some parts</p>
<p>of it in a positive way? So that you know, for me, especially</p>
<p>coming from the field of computer science and computer</p>
<p>engineering and robotics, it seems that the human body is</p>
<p>exceptionally complicated, and how the heck you can figure out</p>
<p>anything is amazing.</p>
<p>I agree with you. I think it&rsquo;s super complicated. I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still just scratching the surface in many ways. But I feel</p>
<p>like we have made progress in different ways. And some of its</p>
<p>by really understanding things like we were just talking about</p>
<p>other times, you know, you might, or somebody might we or</p>
<p>others might invent technologies that might be helpful on</p>
<p>exploring that. And I think over many years, we&rsquo;ve understood</p>
<p>things better and better, but we still have such a long ways to</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>Are there? I mean, if you just look at the other things that</p>
<p>are there knobs that are reliably controllable about the</p>
<p>human body, if you consider is there is it? So if you start to</p>
<p>think about controlling various aspects of when we talk about</p>
<p>drug delivery a little bit, but controlling various aspects</p>
<p>chemically of the human body, is there a solid understanding</p>
<p>across the populations of humans that are solid, reliable knobs</p>
<p>that can be controlled?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s hard to do. But on the other hand, whenever we</p>
<p>make a new drug or medical device, to a certain extent,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing that, you know, in a small way, what you just said,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know that there are great knobs. I mean, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning about those knobs all the time. But if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>biological pathway or something that you can affect, or</p>
<p>understand, I mean, then that might be such a knob.</p>
<p>So what is a pharmaceutical drug? How do you do? How do you</p>
<p>discover a specific one? How do you test it? How do you</p>
<p>understand it? How do you ship it?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll give an example, which goes back to</p>
<p>what I said before. So when I was doing my postdoctoral work</p>
<p>with Judah Folkman, we wanted to come up with drugs that would</p>
<p>stop blood vessels from growing or alternatively make them grow.</p>
<p>And actually, people didn&rsquo;t even believe that, that those things</p>
<p>could happen. But</p>
<p>could we pause on that for a second? Sure. What is a blood</p>
<p>vessel? What does it mean for a blood vessel to grow and shrink?</p>
<p>And why is that important?</p>
<p>Sure. So a blood vessel is could be an artery or vein or a</p>
<p>capillary. And it, you know, provides oxygen, it provides</p>
<p>nutrients gets rid of waste. So, you know, to different parts of</p>
<p>your body if you so so the blood vessels end up being very, very</p>
<p>important. And, you know, if you have cancer, blood vessels grow</p>
<p>into the tumor. And that&rsquo;s part of what enables the tumor to get</p>
<p>bigger. And that&rsquo;s also part of what enables the tumor to</p>
<p>metastasize and which means spread throughout the body and</p>
<p>ultimately kill somebody. So that was part of what we were</p>
<p>trying to do. We tried what we wanted to see if we could find</p>
<p>substances that could stop that from happening. So first, I</p>
<p>mean, there are many steps. First, we had to develop a bio</p>
<p>assay to study blood vessel growth. Again, there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>one. That&rsquo;s where we needed the polymer systems because the</p>
<p>blood vessels grew slowly took months. That so after we had the</p>
<p>polymer system and we had the bio assay, then I isolated many</p>
<p>different molecules initially from cartilage. And almost all</p>
<p>of them didn&rsquo;t work. But we were fortunate we found one it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>purified, but we found one that did work. And that paper that</p>
<p>was this paper I mentioned science in 1976. Those were</p>
<p>really the isolation of some of the very first angiogenesis and</p>
<p>blood vessel inhibitors.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of words there. Yeah, let&rsquo;s go. First of all,</p>
<p>polymer molecules, big, big molecules. So the what are</p>
<p>polymers? What&rsquo;s bio assay? What is the process of trying to</p>
<p>isolate this whole thing simplified to where you can</p>
<p>control and experiment with it?</p>
<p>Polymers are like plastics or like plastics or rubber. What</p>
<p>were some of the other questions?</p>
<p>Sorry, so a polymer, some plastics and rubber, and that</p>
<p>means something that has structure and that could be</p>
<p>useful for what?</p>
<p>Well, in this case, it would be something that could be useful</p>
<p>for delivering a molecule for a long time. So it could slowly</p>
<p>diffuse out of that at a controlled rate to where you</p>
<p>wanted it to go.</p>
<p>So then you would find the idea is that there would be a</p>
<p>particular blood vessels that you can target, say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>connected somehow to a tumor that you could target and over</p>
<p>a long period of time to be able to place the polymer there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be delivering a certain kind of chemical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. I think what you said is good. So so that it</p>
<p>would deliver the molecule or the chemical that would stop</p>
<p>the blood vessels from going over a long enough time so that</p>
<p>it really could happen. So that was sort of the what we call</p>
<p>the bio assay is the way that we would study that.</p>
<p>So, sorry, so what is a bio assay? Which part is the bio</p>
<p>assay?</p>
<p>All of it. In other words, the bio assay is the way you study</p>
<p>blood vessel growth.</p>
<p>The blood vessel growth and you can control that somehow with</p>
<p>is there an understanding what kind of chemicals could control</p>
<p>the growth of a blood vessel?</p>
<p>Sure. Well, now there is, but then when I started, there</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t and that that gets to your original question. So you</p>
<p>go through various steps. We did the first steps. We showed</p>
<p>that a such molecules existed and then we developed</p>
<p>techniques for studying them. And we even isolated fractions,</p>
<p>you know, groups of substances that would do it. But what</p>
<p>would happen over the next, we did that in 1976, we published</p>
<p>that what would happen over the next 28 years is other people</p>
<p>would follow in our footsteps. I mean, we tried to do some</p>
<p>stuff too, but ultimately to make a new drug takes billions</p>
<p>of dollars. So what happened was there were different growth</p>
<p>factors that people would isolate, sometimes using the</p>
<p>techniques that we developed. And then they would figure out</p>
<p>using some of those techniques, ways to stop those growth</p>
<p>factors and ways to stop the blood vessels from growing. That</p>
<p>like I say, it took 28 years, it took billions of dollars and</p>
<p>work by many companies like Genetec. But in 2004, 28 years</p>
<p>after we started, the first one of those Avastin got approved</p>
<p>by the FDA. And that&rsquo;s become, you know, one of the top</p>
<p>biotech selling drugs in history. And it&rsquo;s been approved</p>
<p>for all kinds of cancers and actually for many eye diseases</p>
<p>too, where you have abnormal blood vessel growth, macular.</p>
<p>So in general, one of the key ways you can alleviate, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the hope in terms of tumors associated with cancerous</p>
<p>tumors? What can you help by being able to control the</p>
<p>growth of vessels?</p>
<p>So if you cut off the blood supply, you cut off the, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a war almost, right? If the nutrition is going</p>
<p>to the tumor and you can cut it off, I mean, you starve the</p>
<p>tumor and it becomes very small, it may disappear or it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be much more amenable to other therapies because it is</p>
<p>tiny, you know, like, you know, chemotherapy or immunotherapy</p>
<p>is going to be, have a much easier time against a small</p>
<p>tumor than a big one.</p>
<p>Is that an obvious idea? I mean, it seems like a very clever</p>
<p>strategy in this war against cancer.</p>
<p>Well, you know, in retrospect, it&rsquo;s an obvious idea, but when</p>
<p>Dr. Folkman, my boss first proposed it, it wasn&rsquo;t, a lot of</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t thought he was pretty crazy.</p>
<p>And so in what sense, if you can sort of linger on it, when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about these ideas at the time, were you</p>
<p>feeling you&rsquo;re out in the dark?</p>
<p>So how much mystery is there about the whole thing?</p>
<p>How much just blind experimentation, if you can put</p>
<p>yourself in that mindset from years ago?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there was, I mean, for me, actually, it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>the idea.</p>
<p>It was that I didn&rsquo;t know a lot of biology or biochemistry.</p>
<p>So I certainly felt I was in the dark, but I kept trying and</p>
<p>I kept trying to learn and I kept plugging.</p>
<p>But I mean, a lot of it was being in the dark.</p>
<p>So the human body is complicated, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll establish this.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics in physics is a theory that works incredibly</p>
<p>well, but we don&rsquo;t really necessarily understand the underlying</p>
<p>nature of it.</p>
<p>So are drugs the same in that you&rsquo;re ultimately trying to</p>
<p>show that the thing works to do something that you try to do,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t necessarily understand the fundamental</p>
<p>mechanisms by which it&rsquo;s doing it?</p>
<p>It really varies.</p>
<p>I think sometimes people do know them because they&rsquo;ve figured</p>
<p>out pathways and ways to interfere with them.</p>
<p>Other times it is shooting in the dark.</p>
<p>It really has varied.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And sometimes people make serendipitous discoveries and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even realize what they did.</p>
<p>So what is the discovery process for a drug?</p>
<p>You said a bunch of people trying to work with this.</p>
<p>Is it a kind of a mix of serendipitous discovery and art,</p>
<p>or is there a systematic science to trying different chemical</p>
<p>reactions and how they affect whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>like shrink blood vessels?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single way to go about</p>
<p>something in terms of characterizing the entire drug</p>
<p>discovery process.</p>
<p>If I look at the blood vessel one,</p>
<p>yeah, there the first step was to have the kinds of theories</p>
<p>that Dr. Folkman had.</p>
<p>The second step was to have the techniques where you could</p>
<p>study blood vessel growth for the first time and at least</p>
<p>quantitate or semi quantitate it.</p>
<p>Third step was to find substances that would stop blood</p>
<p>vessels from growing.</p>
<p>Fourth step was to maybe purify those substances.</p>
<p>There are many other steps too.</p>
<p>I mean, before you have an effective drug,</p>
<p>you have to show that it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>You have to show that it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>And you start with animals.</p>
<p>You ultimately go to patients.</p>
<p>And there are multiple kinds of clinical trials you have to do.</p>
<p>If you step back, is it amazing to you</p>
<p>that we descendants of great apes</p>
<p>are able to create drugs, chemicals that</p>
<p>are able to improve some aspects of our bodies?</p>
<p>Or is it quite natural that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to discover these kinds of things?</p>
<p>Well, at a high level, it is amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, evolution is amazing.</p>
<p>The way I look at your question, the fact</p>
<p>that we have evolved the way we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about drug delivery.</p>
<p>What are the difficult problems in drug delivery?</p>
<p>What is drug delivery from starting</p>
<p>from your early seminal work in the field to today?</p>
<p>Well, drug delivery is getting a drug</p>
<p>to go where you want it, at the level you want it,</p>
<p>in a safe way.</p>
<p>Some of the big challenges, I mean, there are a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d say one is, could you target the right cell?</p>
<p>Like, we talked about cancers or some way</p>
<p>to deliver a drug just to a cancer cell and no other cell.</p>
<p>Another challenge is to get drugs</p>
<p>across different barriers.</p>
<p>Like, could you ever give insulin orally?</p>
<p>Could you, or give it passively transdermally?</p>
<p>Can you get drugs across the blood brain barrier?</p>
<p>I mean, there are lots of big challenges.</p>
<p>Can you make smart drug delivery systems</p>
<p>that might respond to physiologic signals in the body?</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So smart, they have some kind of sense,</p>
<p>a chemical sensor, or is there something more</p>
<p>than a chemical sensor that&rsquo;s able to respond</p>
<p>to something in the body?</p>
<p>Could be either one.</p>
<p>I mean, one example might be if you were diabetic,</p>
<p>if you got more glucose, could you get more insulin?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>Is there some way to control the actual mechanism</p>
<p>of delivery in response to what the body&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is encapsulate what are called beta cells.</p>
<p>Those are insulin producing cells in a way</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re safe and protected.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;ll happen is glucose will go in</p>
<p>and the cells will make insulin.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>So from an AI robotics perspective,</p>
<p>how close are these drug delivery systems</p>
<p>to something like a robot?</p>
<p>Or is it totally wrong to think about them</p>
<p>as intelligent agents?</p>
<p>And how much room is there to add that kind of intelligence</p>
<p>into these delivery systems, perhaps in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it depends on the particular delivery system.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the things people are concerned about</p>
<p>is cost, and if you add a lot of bells and whistles</p>
<p>to something, it&rsquo;ll cost more.</p>
<p>But I mean, we, for example, have made</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll call intelligent microchips</p>
<p>that can, where you can send a signal</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll release drug in response to that signal.</p>
<p>And I think systems like that microchip someday</p>
<p>have the potential to do what you and I</p>
<p>were just talking about,</p>
<p>that there could be a signal like glucose</p>
<p>and it could have some instruction to say</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s more glucose, deliver more insulin.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible that there,</p>
<p>that could be robotic type systems roaming our body</p>
<p>sort of long term and be able to deliver</p>
<p>certain kinds of drugs in the future?</p>
<p>You see, do you see that kind of future?</p>
<p>Someday, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re very close to it yet,</p>
<p>but someday, you know that that&rsquo;s nanotechnology</p>
<p>and that would mean even miniaturizing</p>
<p>some of the things that I just discussed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re certainly not at that point yet,</p>
<p>but someday I expect we will be.</p>
<p>So some of it is just the shrinking of the technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a part of it, that&rsquo;s one of the things.</p>
<p>In general, what role do you see AI sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of work now with using data</p>
<p>to make intelligent, create systems</p>
<p>that make intelligent decisions.</p>
<p>Do you see any of that data driven kind of computing systems</p>
<p>having a role in any part of this,</p>
<p>into the delivery of drugs, the design of drugs</p>
<p>and any part of the chain?</p>
<p>I do, I think that AI can be useful</p>
<p>in a number of parts of the chain.</p>
<p>I mean, one, I think if you get a large amount</p>
<p>of information, you know, say you have some chemical data</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve done high throughput screens</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll just make this up,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say I have a, I&rsquo;m trying to come up with a drug</p>
<p>to treat disease X, whatever that disease is</p>
<p>and I have a test for that and hopefully a fast test</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say I test 10,000 chemical substances</p>
<p>and a couple work, most of them don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>some maybe work a little, but if I had a,</p>
<p>with the right kind of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>maybe you could look at the chemical structures</p>
<p>and look at what works and see</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s certain commonalities,</p>
<p>look at what doesn&rsquo;t work and see what commonalities</p>
<p>there are and then maybe use that somehow</p>
<p>to predict the next generation of things</p>
<p>that you would test.</p>
<p>As a tangent, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>on our society&rsquo;s relationship with pharmaceutical drugs?</p>
<p>Do we, and perhaps I apologize</p>
<p>if this is a philosophical broader question,</p>
<p>but do we over rely on them?</p>
<p>Do we improperly prescribe them?</p>
<p>In what ways is the system working well</p>
<p>and what way can it improve?</p>
<p>Well, I think pharmaceutical drugs are really important.</p>
<p>I mean, the life expectancy and life quality of people</p>
<p>over many, many years has increased tremendously</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a really good thing.</p>
<p>I think one thing that would also be good</p>
<p>is if we could extend that more and more</p>
<p>to people in the developing world,</p>
<p>which is something that our lab has been doing</p>
<p>with the Gates Foundation or trying to do.</p>
<p>So I think ways in which it could improve,</p>
<p>I mean, if there was some way to reduce costs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s certainly an issue people are concerned about.</p>
<p>If there was some way to help people in poor countries,</p>
<p>that would also be a good thing.</p>
<p>And then of course, we still need to make better drugs</p>
<p>for so many diseases.</p>
<p>I mean, cancer, diabetes.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s heart disease and rare diseases.</p>
<p>There are many, many situations where it&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>if we could do better and help more people.</p>
<p>Can we talk about another exciting space,</p>
<p>which is tissue engineering?</p>
<p>What is tissue engineering or regenerative medicine?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that tissue engineering or regenerative medicine</p>
<p>have to do with building an organ or tissue from scratch.</p>
<p>So someday maybe we can build a liver</p>
<p>or make new cartilage and also would enable you</p>
<p>to someday create organs on a chip,</p>
<p>which we and others are trying to do,</p>
<p>which might lead to better drug testing</p>
<p>and maybe less testing on animals or people.</p>
<p>Organs on a chip, that sounds fascinating.</p>
<p>So what are the various ways to generate tissue?</p>
<p>And how do, so is it, you know,</p>
<p>the one is of course from stem cells.</p>
<p>Is there other methods?</p>
<p>What are the different possible flavors here?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think, I mean, there&rsquo;s multiple components.</p>
<p>One is having generally some type of scaffold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Jay Vacanti and I started many, many years ago.</p>
<p>And then on that scaffold,</p>
<p>you might put different cell types,</p>
<p>which could be a cartilage cell, a bone cell,</p>
<p>could be a stem cell that might differentiate</p>
<p>into different things, could be more than one cell.</p>
<p>And the scaffold, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>is kind of like a canvas that&rsquo;s a structure</p>
<p>that you can, on which the cells can grow?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good explanation what you just did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to use that, the canvas, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>You know, and the chip could be such a canvas.</p>
<p>Could be fibers that are made of plastics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d put in the body someday.</p>
<p>And when you say chip, do you mean electronic chip?</p>
<p>Like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Not necessarily, it could be though.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be, it could just be a structure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in vivo, so to speak,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s outside the body.</p>
<p>So is there&hellip;</p>
<p>Canvas is not a bad word.</p>
<p>So is there a possibility to weave into this canvas</p>
<p>a computational component?</p>
<p>So if we talk about electronic chips,</p>
<p>some ability to sense, control,</p>
<p>some aspect of this growth process for the tissue.</p>
<p>I would say the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>I think right now people are working mostly</p>
<p>on validating these kinds of chips for saying,</p>
<p>well, it does work as effectively,</p>
<p>or hopefully as just putting something in the body.</p>
<p>But I think someday what you suggested,</p>
<p>you certainly would be possible.</p>
<p>So what kind of tissues can we engineer today?</p>
<p>What would, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so skin&rsquo;s already been made</p>
<p>and approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>There are advanced clinical trials,</p>
<p>like what are called phase three trials,</p>
<p>that are at complete or near completion</p>
<p>for making new blood vessels.</p>
<p>One of my former students, Laura Nicholson,</p>
<p>led a lot of that.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So human skin can be grown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already approved in the entire, the FDA process.</p>
<p>So that means what,</p>
<p>so one, that means you can grow that tissue</p>
<p>and do various kinds of experiments</p>
<p>in terms of drugs and so on.</p>
<p>But what does that, does that mean</p>
<p>that some kind of healing and treatment</p>
<p>of different conditions for unhuman beings?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, they&rsquo;ve been approved now for,</p>
<p>I mean, different groups have made them,</p>
<p>different companies and different professors,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been approved for burn victims</p>
<p>and for patients with diabetic skin ulcers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Okay, so skin, what else?</p>
<p>Well, at different stages,</p>
<p>people are, like skin, blood vessels,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clinical trials going now for helping patients</p>
<p>hear better, for patients that might be paralyzed,</p>
<p>for patients that have different eye problems.</p>
<p>I mean, and different groups have worked on</p>
<p>just about everything, new liver, new kidneys.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;ve been all kinds of work done in this area.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s early, but there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>a lot of activity.</p>
<p>What about neural tissue?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The nervous system and even the brain.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;ve been people out of working on that too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a little bit with that,</p>
<p>but there are people who&rsquo;ve done a lot on neural stem cells</p>
<p>and I know Evan Snyder, who&rsquo;s been one of our collaborators</p>
<p>on some of our spinal cord works done work like that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ve been other people as well.</p>
<p>Is there challenges for the,</p>
<p>when it is part of the human body,</p>
<p>is there challenges to getting the body to accept</p>
<p>this new tissue that&rsquo;s being generated?</p>
<p>How do you solve that kind of challenge?</p>
<p>There can be problems with accepting it.</p>
<p>I think maybe in particular,</p>
<p>you might mean rejection by the body.</p>
<p>So there are multiple ways that people are trying</p>
<p>to deal with that.</p>
<p>One way is, which was what we&rsquo;ve done with Dan Anderson,</p>
<p>who was one of my former postdocs</p>
<p>and I mentioned this a little bit before for a pancreas,</p>
<p>is encapsulating the cells.</p>
<p>So immune cells or antibodies can&rsquo;t get in and attack them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a way to protect them.</p>
<p>Other strategies could be making the cells non immunogenic,</p>
<p>which might be done by different either techniques</p>
<p>which might mask them or using some gene editing approaches.</p>
<p>So there are different ways that people</p>
<p>are trying to do that.</p>
<p>And of course, if you use the patient&rsquo;s own cells</p>
<p>or cells from a close relative, that might be another way.</p>
<p>It increases the likelihood that it&rsquo;ll get accepted</p>
<p>if you use the patient&rsquo;s own cells.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then finally, there&rsquo;s immunosuppressive drugs,</p>
<p>which will suppress the immune response.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right now what&rsquo;s done, say, for a liver transplant.</p>
<p>The fact that this whole thing works is fascinating,</p>
<p>at least from my outside perspective.</p>
<p>Will we one day be able to regenerate any organ</p>
<p>or part of the human body?</p>
<p>Any of you?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s exciting to think about future possibilities</p>
<p>of tissue engineering.</p>
<p>Do you see some tissues more difficult than others?</p>
<p>What are the possibilities here?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, of course, I&rsquo;m an optimist.</p>
<p>And I also feel the timeframe,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about someday,</p>
<p>someday could be hundreds of years.</p>
<p>But I think that, yes, someday,</p>
<p>I think we will be able to regenerate many things.</p>
<p>And there are different strategies that one might use.</p>
<p>One might use some cells themselves.</p>
<p>One might use some molecules</p>
<p>that might help regenerate the cells.</p>
<p>And so I think there are different possibilities.</p>
<p>What do you think that means for longevity?</p>
<p>If we look maybe not someday, but 10, 20 years out,</p>
<p>the possibilities of tissue engineering,</p>
<p>the possibilities of the research that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>does it have a significant impact</p>
<p>on the longevity of human life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>a radical increase in longevity,</p>
<p>but I think that in certain areas,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see people live better lives</p>
<p>and maybe somewhat longer lives.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most beautiful scientific idea</p>
<p>in bioengineering that you&rsquo;ve come across</p>
<p>in your years of research?</p>
<p>I apologize for the romantic question.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I certainly think what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>with CRISPR is a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>That certainly wasn&rsquo;t my idea.</p>
<p>I mean, but I think it&rsquo;s very interesting here</p>
<p>what people have capitalized on</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a mechanism by which bacteria</p>
<p>are able to destroy viruses.</p>
<p>And that understanding that leads to machinery</p>
<p>to sort of cut and paste genes and fix a cell.</p>
<p>So that kind of, do you see a promise</p>
<p>for that kind of ability to copy and paste?</p>
<p>I mean, like we said, the human body is complicated.</p>
<p>Is that, that seems exceptionally difficult to do.</p>
<p>I think it is exceptionally difficult to do,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it won&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of companies and people trying to do it.</p>
<p>And I think in some areas it will be done.</p>
<p>Some of the ways that you might lower the bar</p>
<p>are not, are just taking,</p>
<p>like not necessarily doing it directly,</p>
<p>but you could take a cell that might be useful,</p>
<p>but you want to give it some cancer killing capabilities,</p>
<p>something like what&rsquo;s called a CAR T cell.</p>
<p>And that might be a different way</p>
<p>of somehow making a CAR T cell and maybe making it better.</p>
<p>So there might be sort of easier things</p>
<p>and rather than just fixing the whole body.</p>
<p>So the way a lot of things have moved with medicine</p>
<p>over time is stepwise.</p>
<p>So I can see things that might be easier to do</p>
<p>than say, fix a brain.</p>
<p>That would be very hard to do,</p>
<p>but maybe someday that&rsquo;ll happen too.</p>
<p>So in terms of stepwise, that&rsquo;s an interesting notion.</p>
<p>Do you see that if you look at medicine or bioengineering,</p>
<p>do you see that there is these big leaps</p>
<p>that happen every decade or so, or some distant period,</p>
<p>or is it a lot of incremental work?</p>
<p>Not, I don&rsquo;t mean to reduce its impact</p>
<p>by saying it&rsquo;s incremental,</p>
<p>but is there sort of phase shifts in the science,</p>
<p>big leaps?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>Every so often a new technique or a new technology comes out.</p>
<p>I mean, genetic engineering was an example.</p>
<p>I mentioned CRISPR.</p>
<p>I think every so often things happen</p>
<p>that make a big difference,</p>
<p>but still there&rsquo;s to try to really make progress,</p>
<p>make a new drug, make a new device.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d call them incremental,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot, a lot of work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So you have over, numbers could be off,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a big amount.</p>
<p>You have over 1,100 current or pending patents</p>
<p>that have been licensed, sublicensed</p>
<p>to over 300 companies.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view, what in your view are the strengths</p>
<p>and what are the drawbacks of the patenting process?</p>
<p>Well, I think for the most part, there&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
<p>I think that if you didn&rsquo;t have patents,</p>
<p>especially in medicine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d never get the funding that it takes</p>
<p>to make a new drug or a new device.</p>
<p>I mean, which according to Tufts,</p>
<p>to make a new drug costs over $2 billion right now.</p>
<p>And nobody would even come close to giving you that money,</p>
<p>any of that money, if it weren&rsquo;t for the patent system,</p>
<p>because then anybody else could do it.</p>
<p>That then leads to the negative though.</p>
<p>Sometimes somebody does have a very successful drug</p>
<p>and you certainly wanna try to make it available</p>
<p>to everybody.</p>
<p>And so the patent system allowed it to happen</p>
<p>in the first place, but maybe it&rsquo;ll impede it</p>
<p>after a little bit, or certainly to some people</p>
<p>or to some companies, once it is out there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, on the point of the cost,</p>
<p>what would you say is the most expensive part</p>
<p>of the $2 billion of making a drug?</p>
<p>Human clinical trials.</p>
<p>That is by far the most expensive.</p>
<p>In terms of money or pain or both?</p>
<p>Well, money, but pain goes, it&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>I mean, but usually proving things that are,</p>
<p>proving that something new is safe and effective in people</p>
<p>is almost always the biggest expense.</p>
<p>Could you linger on that for just a little longer</p>
<p>and describe what it takes to prove,</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t know, in general,</p>
<p>what it takes to prove that something is effective on humans?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d have to take a particular disease,</p>
<p>but the process is you start out with,</p>
<p>usually you start out with cells,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d go to animal models.</p>
<p>Usually you have to do a couple animal models.</p>
<p>And of course the animal models aren&rsquo;t perfect for humans.</p>
<p>And then you have to do three sets of clinical trials</p>
<p>at a minimum, a phase one trial to show that it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>in small number of patients, a phase two trial</p>
<p>to show that it&rsquo;s effective in a small number of patients,</p>
<p>and a phase three trial to show that it&rsquo;s safe and effective</p>
<p>in a large number of patients.</p>
<p>And that could end up being hundreds</p>
<p>or thousands of patients.</p>
<p>And they have to be really carefully controlled studies.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have to manufacture the drug,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to really watch those patients.</p>
<p>You have to be very concerned that it is gonna be safe.</p>
<p>And then you look and see, does it treat the disease better</p>
<p>than whatever the gold standard was before that?</p>
<p>Assuming there was one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting line.</p>
<p>Show that it&rsquo;s safe first, and then that it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>First do no harm.</p>
<p>First do no harm, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So how, again, if you can linger in a little bit,</p>
<p>how does the patenting process work?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you do a certain amount of research,</p>
<p>though that&rsquo;s not necessarily has to be the case.</p>
<p>But for us, usually it is.</p>
<p>Usually we do a certain amount of research</p>
<p>and make some findings.</p>
<p>And we had a hypothesis, let&rsquo;s say we prove it,</p>
<p>or we make some discovery, we invent some technique.</p>
<p>And then we write something up, what&rsquo;s called a disclosure.</p>
<p>We give it to MIT&rsquo;s technology transfer office.</p>
<p>They then give it to some patent attorneys,</p>
<p>and they use that plus talking to us</p>
<p>and work on writing a patent.</p>
<p>And then you go back and forth with the USPTO,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>And they may not allow it the first, second or third time,</p>
<p>but they will tell you why they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you may adjust it,</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;ll eventually get it, and maybe you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been part of launching 40 companies</p>
<p>together worth, again, numbers could be outdated,</p>
<p>but an estimated $23 billion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve described your thoughts</p>
<p>on a formula for startup success.</p>
<p>So perhaps you can describe that formula</p>
<p>and in general describe what does it take</p>
<p>to build a successful startup?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d break that down into a couple of categories.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a scientist and certainly</p>
<p>from the science standpoint, I&rsquo;ll go over that.</p>
<p>But I actually think that really the most important thing</p>
<p>is probably the business people that I work with.</p>
<p>And when I look back at the companies that have done well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been because we&rsquo;ve had great business people.</p>
<p>And when they haven&rsquo;t done as well,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t had as good business people.</p>
<p>But from a science standpoint,</p>
<p>I think about that we&rsquo;ve made some kind of discovery</p>
<p>that is almost what I&rsquo;d call a platform</p>
<p>that you could use it for different things.</p>
<p>And certainly the drug delivery system example</p>
<p>that I gave earlier is a good example of that.</p>
<p>You could use it for drug A, B, C, D, E and so forth.</p>
<p>And that I&rsquo;d like to think that we&rsquo;ve taken it far enough</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;ve written at least one really good paper</p>
<p>in a top journal, hopefully a number</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve reduced it to practice and animal models</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve filed patents, maybe had issued patents</p>
<p>that have what I&rsquo;ll call very good and broad claims.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the key on a patent.</p>
<p>And then in our case, a lot of times when we&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>a lot of times it&rsquo;s somebody in the lab</p>
<p>like a postdoc or graduate student</p>
<p>that spent a big part of their life doing it</p>
<p>and that they wanna work at that company</p>
<p>because they have this passion</p>
<p>that they wanna see something they did</p>
<p>make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Maybe you can mention the business component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to hear Grace had to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s value to business folks.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always said.</p>
<p>So what value, what business instinct is valuable</p>
<p>to make a startup successful, a company successful?</p>
<p>I think the business aspects are,</p>
<p>you have to be a good judge of people</p>
<p>so that you hire the right people.</p>
<p>You have to be strategic so you figure out</p>
<p>if you do have that platform</p>
<p>that could be used for all these different things.</p>
<p>And knowing that medical research is so expensive,</p>
<p>what thing are you gonna do first, second,</p>
<p>third, fourth and fifth?</p>
<p>I think you need to have a good,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll call FDA regulatory clinical trial strategy.</p>
<p>I think you have to be able to raise money incredibly.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things.</p>
<p>You have to be good with people, good manager of people.</p>
<p>So the money and the people part I get,</p>
<p>but the stuff before in terms of deciding the A, B, C, D,</p>
<p>if you have a platform which drugs to first take a testing,</p>
<p>you see nevertheless scientists</p>
<p>as not being always too good at that process.</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re a part of the process,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s probably, I&rsquo;m gonna just make this up,</p>
<p>but maybe six or seven criteria that you wanna use</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just science.</p>
<p>I mean, the kinds of things that I would think about</p>
<p>is, is the market big or small?</p>
<p>Is the, are there good animal models for it</p>
<p>so that you could test it and it wouldn&rsquo;t take 50 years?</p>
<p>Are the clinical trials that could be set up</p>
<p>ones that have clear end points</p>
<p>where you can make a judgment?</p>
<p>And another issue would be competition.</p>
<p>Are there other ways that some companies</p>
<p>out there are doing it?</p>
<p>Another issue would be reimbursement.</p>
<p>You know, can it get reimbursed?</p>
<p>So a lot of things that you have manufacturing issues</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d wanna consider.</p>
<p>So I think there are really a lot of things</p>
<p>that go into whether you,</p>
<p>what you do first, second, third, or fourth.</p>
<p>So you lead one of the largest academic labs in the world</p>
<p>with over $10 million in annual grants</p>
<p>and over a hundred researchers,</p>
<p>probably over a thousand since the lab&rsquo;s beginning.</p>
<p>Researchers can be individualistic and eccentric.</p>
<p>How do I put it nicely?</p>
<p>There you go, eccentric.</p>
<p>So what insights into research leadership can you give</p>
<p>having to run such a successful lab</p>
<p>with so much diverse talent?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m any expert.</p>
<p>I think that what you do to me,</p>
<p>I mean, I just want,</p>
<p>I mean, this is gonna sound very simplistic,</p>
<p>but I just want people in the lab to be happy,</p>
<p>to be doing things that I hope</p>
<p>will make the world a better place,</p>
<p>to be working on science</p>
<p>that can make the world a better place.</p>
<p>And I guess my feeling is if we&rsquo;re able to do that,</p>
<p>you know, it kind of runs itself.</p>
<p>So how do you make a researcher happy in general?</p>
<p>I think when people feel,</p>
<p>I mean, this is gonna sound like, again,</p>
<p>simplistic or maybe like motherhood and apple pie,</p>
<p>but I think if people feel they&rsquo;re working on something</p>
<p>really important that can affect many other people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making some progress,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll feel good about it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll feel good about themselves</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>But through brainstorming and so on,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your role and how difficult is it as a group</p>
<p>in this collaboration to arrive at these big questions</p>
<p>that might have impact?</p>
<p>Well, the big questions come from many different ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s trying to, things that I might think of</p>
<p>or somebody in the lab might think of,</p>
<p>which could be a new technique</p>
<p>or to understand something better.</p>
<p>But gee, we&rsquo;ve had people like Bill Gates</p>
<p>and the Gates Foundation come to us</p>
<p>and Juvenile Diabetes Foundation come to us and say,</p>
<p>gee, could you help us on these things?</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s good too.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen just one way.</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned it, happiness,</p>
<p>but is there something more,</p>
<p>how do you inspire a researcher</p>
<p>to do the best work of their life?</p>
<p>So you mentioned passion and passion is a kind of fire.</p>
<p>Do you see yourself having a role to keep that fire going,</p>
<p>to build it up, to inspire the researchers</p>
<p>through the pretty difficult process</p>
<p>of going from idea to big question, to big answer?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think I try to do that by talking to people</p>
<p>going over their ideas and their progress.</p>
<p>I try to do it as an individual.</p>
<p>Certainly when I talk about my own career,</p>
<p>I had my setbacks at different times</p>
<p>and people know that, that know me.</p>
<p>And you just try to keep pushing and so forth.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think I try to do that.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think I try to do that</p>
<p>as the one who leads the lab.</p>
<p>So you have this exceptionally successful lab</p>
<p>and one of the great institutions in the world, MIT.</p>
<p>And yet sort of, at least in my neck of the woods</p>
<p>in computer science and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>a lot of the research is kind of,</p>
<p>a lot of the great researchers, not everyone,</p>
<p>but some are kind of going to industry.</p>
<p>A lot of the research is moving to industry.</p>
<p>What do you think about the future of science in general?</p>
<p>Is there drawbacks?</p>
<p>Is there strength to the academic environment</p>
<p>that you hope will persist?</p>
<p>How does it need to change?</p>
<p>What needs to stay the same?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this whole landscape</p>
<p>of science and its future?</p>
<p>Well, first I think going to industry is good,</p>
<p>but I think being in academia is good.</p>
<p>You know, I have lots of students who&rsquo;ve done both</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve had great careers doing both.</p>
<p>I think from an academic standpoint,</p>
<p>I mean, the biggest concern probably that people feel today,</p>
<p>you know, at a place like MIT</p>
<p>or other research heavy institutions is gonna be funding</p>
<p>and particular funding that&rsquo;s not super directed,</p>
<p>you know, so that you can do basic research.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the number one thing,</p>
<p>but you know, it would be great if we as a society</p>
<p>could come up with better ways to teach,</p>
<p>you know, so that people all over could learn better.</p>
<p>You know, so I think there are a number of things</p>
<p>that would be good to be able to do better.</p>
<p>So again, you&rsquo;re very successful in terms of funding,</p>
<p>but do you still feel the pressure of that,</p>
<p>of having to seek funding?</p>
<p>Does it affect the science or is it,</p>
<p>or can you simply focus on doing the best work of your life</p>
<p>and the funding comes along with that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the last 10 or 15 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done pretty well funding,</p>
<p>but I always worry about it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re still operating</p>
<p>on more soft money than hard.</p>
<p>And so I always worry about it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve been fortunate that places have come to us</p>
<p>like the Gates Foundation and others,</p>
<p>Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, some companies,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re willing to give us funding</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gotten government money as well.</p>
<p>We have a number of NIH grants and I&rsquo;ve always had that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s important to me too.</p>
<p>So I worry about it, but you know,</p>
<p>I just view that as a part of the process.</p>
<p>Now, if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist,</p>
<p>like say I gave you $100 billion right now,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t spend it on your own research.</p>
<p>So how hard is it to decide which labs to invest in,</p>
<p>which ideas, which problems, which solutions?</p>
<p>You know, cause funding is so much,</p>
<p>such an important part of progression of science</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>So if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist,</p>
<p>how hard is that problem?</p>
<p>How would you go about solving it?</p>
<p>Sure, well, I think what I do, the first thing is different</p>
<p>philanthropists have different visions.</p>
<p>And I think the first thing is to form a concrete vision</p>
<p>of what you want.</p>
<p>Some people, I mean, I&rsquo;ll just give you two examples</p>
<p>of people that I know.</p>
<p>David Koch was very interested in cancer research</p>
<p>and part of that was that he had prostate cancer.</p>
<p>And a number of people do that along those lines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had somebody, they&rsquo;ve either had cancer themselves</p>
<p>or somebody they loved had cancer</p>
<p>and they wanna put money into cancer research.</p>
<p>Bill Gates, on the other hand,</p>
<p>I think when he had got his fortune,</p>
<p>I mean, he thought about it and felt, well,</p>
<p>how could he have the greatest impact?</p>
<p>And he thought about, you know, helping people</p>
<p>in the developing world and medicines</p>
<p>and different things like that, like vaccines</p>
<p>that might be really helpful for people</p>
<p>in the developing world.</p>
<p>And so I think first you start out with that vision.</p>
<p>Once you start out with that vision, whatever vision it is,</p>
<p>then I think you try to ask the question,</p>
<p>who in the world does the best work if that was your goal?</p>
<p>I mean, but you really, I think have to have</p>
<p>a defined vision.</p>
<p>Vision first.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s what people do.</p>
<p>I mean, I have never seen anybody do it otherwise.</p>
<p>I mean, and that, by the way,</p>
<p>may not be the best thing overall.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s good that all those things happen,</p>
<p>but, you know, what you really want to do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll make a contrast in a second,</p>
<p>in addition to funding important areas,</p>
<p>like what both of those people did, is to help young people.</p>
<p>And they may be at odds with each other</p>
<p>because a far more, a lab like ours,</p>
<p>which is, you know, I&rsquo;m older, is, you know,</p>
<p>might be very good at addressing some of those kinds</p>
<p>of problems, but, you know, I&rsquo;m not young.</p>
<p>I train a lot of people who are young,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same as helping somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an assistant professor someplace.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s, I think, been good about our thing,</p>
<p>our society, or things overall,</p>
<p>are that there are people who come at it</p>
<p>from different ways, and the combination,</p>
<p>the confluence of the government funding,</p>
<p>the certain foundations that fund things,</p>
<p>and other foundations that, you know,</p>
<p>want to see disease treated,</p>
<p>well, then they can go seek out people,</p>
<p>or they can put a request for proposals</p>
<p>and see who does the best.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d say both David Koch and Bill Gates</p>
<p>did exactly that.</p>
<p>They sought out people, both of them, you know,</p>
<p>or their foundations that they were involved in,</p>
<p>sought out people like myself.</p>
<p>But they also had requests for proposals.</p>
<p>Now, you mentioned young people,</p>
<p>and that reminds me of something you said</p>
<p>in an interview of Written Somewhere,</p>
<p>that said some of your initial struggles</p>
<p>in terms of finding a faculty position, or so on,</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t quite, for people,</p>
<p>fit into a particular bucket, a particular.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that?</p>
<p>How, do you see limitations to the academic system</p>
<p>that it does have such buckets?</p>
<p>Is there, how can we allow for people</p>
<p>who are brilliant, but outside the disciplines</p>
<p>of the previous decade?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I think that, I think the department heads</p>
<p>have to have a vision, you know, and some of them do.</p>
<p>Every so often, you know, there are institutes</p>
<p>or labs that do that.</p>
<p>I mean, at MIT, I think that&rsquo;s done sometimes.</p>
<p>I know mechanical engineering department just had a search,</p>
<p>and they hired Gio Traverso, who is one of my,</p>
<p>he was a fellow with me, but he&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a molecular biologist and a gastroenterologist.</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s one of the best in the world,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also done some great mechanical engineering</p>
<p>and designing some new pills and things like that.</p>
<p>And they picked him, and boy, I give them a lot of credit.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s vision, to pick somebody.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, they&rsquo;ll be the richer four.</p>
<p>I think the Media Lab has certainly hired, you know,</p>
<p>people like Ed Boyden and others who have done,</p>
<p>you know, very different things.</p>
<p>And so I think that, you know, that&rsquo;s part of the vision</p>
<p>of the leadership who do things like that.</p>
<p>Do you think one day, you&rsquo;ve mentioned David Koch and cancer,</p>
<p>do you think one day we&rsquo;ll cure cancer?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, of course, one day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long that day will come.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, soon, soon, no, but I think.</p>
<p>So you think it is a grand challenge,</p>
<p>it is a grand challenge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just solvable within a few years.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think very many things</p>
<p>are solvable in a few years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some good ideas that people are working on,</p>
<p>but I mean, all cancers, that&rsquo;s pretty tough.</p>
<p>If we do get the cure, what will the cure look like?</p>
<p>Do you think which mechanisms,</p>
<p>which disciplines will help us arrive at that cure</p>
<p>from all the amazing work you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that has touched on cancer?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;ll be a combination</p>
<p>of biology and engineering.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be biology to understand</p>
<p>the right genetic mechanisms to solve this problem</p>
<p>and maybe the right immunological mechanisms</p>
<p>and engineering in the sense of producing the molecules,</p>
<p>developing the right delivery systems,</p>
<p>targeting it or whatever else needs to be done.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a beautiful vision for engineering.</p>
<p>So on a lighter topic, I&rsquo;ve read that you love chocolate</p>
<p>and mentioned two places, Ben and Bill&rsquo;s Chocolate Aquarium</p>
<p>and the chocolate cookies, the Soho Globs</p>
<p>from Rosie&rsquo;s Bakery in Chestnut Hill.</p>
<p>I went to their website and I was trying</p>
<p>to finish a paper last night.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deadline today and yet I was wasting</p>
<p>way too much time at 3 a.m. instead of writing the paper,</p>
<p>staring at the Rosie Baker&rsquo;s cookies,</p>
<p>which are just look incredible.</p>
<p>The Soho Globs just look incredible.</p>
<p>But for me, oatmeal white raisin cookies won my heart</p>
<p>just from the pictures.</p>
<p>Do you think one day we&rsquo;ll be able to engineer</p>
<p>the perfect cookie with the help of chemistry</p>
<p>and maybe a bit of data driven artificial intelligence</p>
<p>or is cookies something that&rsquo;s more art than engineering?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some of both.</p>
<p>I think engineering will probably help someday.</p>
<p>What about chocolate?</p>
<p>Same thing, same thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to go to see some of David Edwards stuff.</p>
<p>He was one of my postdocs and he&rsquo;s a professor at Harvard</p>
<p>but he also started Cafe Art Sciences</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a really cool restaurant around here.</p>
<p>But he also has companies that do ways</p>
<p>of looking at fragrances and trying to use engineering</p>
<p>in new ways and so I think that&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>But I expect someday that AI and engineering</p>
<p>will play a role in almost everything.</p>
<p>Including creating the perfect cookie.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, I dream of that day as well.</p>
<p>So when you look back at your life,</p>
<p>having accomplished an incredible amount of positive impact</p>
<p>on the world through science and engineering,</p>
<p>what are you most proud of?</p>
<p>My students, I really feel when I look at that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve probably had close to 1,000 students</p>
<p>go through the lab and they&rsquo;ve done incredibly well.</p>
<p>I think 18 are in the National Academy of Engineering,</p>
<p>16 in the National Academy of Medicine.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been CEOs of companies,</p>
<p>presidents of universities and they&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I think eight are faculty at MIT,</p>
<p>maybe about 12 at Harvard.</p>
<p>I mean, so it really makes you feel good</p>
<p>to think that the people, they&rsquo;re not my children</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re close to my children in a way</p>
<p>and it makes you feel really good</p>
<p>to see them have such great lives</p>
<p>and them do so much good and be happy.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s a perfect way to end it, Bob.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>Good questions.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson</p>
<p>in his book, A Short History of Nearly Everything.</p>
<p>If this book has a lesson,</p>
<p>it is that we&rsquo;re awfully lucky to be here.</p>
<p>And by we, I mean every living thing.</p>
<p>To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours</p>
<p>appears to be quite an achievement.</p>
<p>As humans, we&rsquo;re doubly lucky, of course.</p>
<p>We enjoy not only the privilege of existence,</p>
<p>but also the singular ability to appreciate it</p>
<p>and even in a multitude of ways to make it better.</p>
<p>It is talent we have only barely begun to grasp.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
