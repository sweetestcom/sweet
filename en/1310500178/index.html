    <p>The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen,</p>
<p>an economist at George Mason University</p>
<p>and co creator of an amazing economics blog</p>
<p>called Marginal Revolution, author of many books,</p>
<p>including The Great Stagnation, Average Is Over</p>
<p>and his most recent Big Business,</p>
<p>A Love Letter to an American Antihero.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s truly a polymath in his work,</p>
<p>including his love for food,</p>
<p>which makes this amazing podcast</p>
<p>called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen to.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Linode, ExpressVPN, Simplisafe and Public Goods.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, given Tyler&rsquo;s culinary explorations,</p>
<p>let me say that one of the things that makes me sad</p>
<p>about my love hate relationship with food</p>
<p>is that while I&rsquo;ve found a simple diet,</p>
<p>plain meat, veggies, that makes me happy in day to day life,</p>
<p>I sometimes wish I had the mental ability</p>
<p>to moderate consumption of food</p>
<p>so that I could truly enjoy meals</p>
<p>that go way outside of that diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen my mom, for example,</p>
<p>enjoy a single piece of chocolate</p>
<p>and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate,</p>
<p>the odds are high that I would end up eating the whole box.</p>
<p>This is definitely something I would like to fix</p>
<p>because some of the amazing artistry in this world</p>
<p>happens in the kitchen and some of the richest</p>
<p>human experiences happen over a unique meal.</p>
<p>I recently was eating cheeseburgers</p>
<p>with Joe Rogan and John Donahue late at night in Austin,</p>
<p>talking about jiu jitsu and life</p>
<p>and I was distinctly aware of the magic of that experience.</p>
<p>Magic made possible by the incredibly</p>
<p>delicious cheeseburgers.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.</p>
<p>Would you say economics is more art or science</p>
<p>or philosophy or even magic?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Economics is interesting because it&rsquo;s all of the above.</p>
<p>To start with magic, the notion that you can</p>
<p>make some change and simply everyone&rsquo;s better off,</p>
<p>that is a kind of modern magic</p>
<p>that has replaced old style magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a science in the sense that occasionally</p>
<p>propositions are falsified.</p>
<p>Are a few basic things we know</p>
<p>and however trivial they may sound,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know them, you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>
<p>So all of the above.</p>
<p>But from my outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>economics is sometimes able to formulate very simple,</p>
<p>almost like E equals MC squared,</p>
<p>general models of how our human society will function</p>
<p>when you do a certain thing.</p>
<p>But it seems impossible or almost way too optimistic</p>
<p>to think that a single formula</p>
<p>or just a set of simple principles</p>
<p>can describe behavior of billions of human beings</p>
<p>with all the complexity that we have involved.</p>
<p>So do you have a sense there&rsquo;s a hope for economics</p>
<p>to have those kinds of physics level descriptions</p>
<p>and models of the world?</p>
<p>Or is it just our desperate attempts as humans</p>
<p>to make sense of it even though it&rsquo;s more desperate</p>
<p>than rigorous and serious and actually predictable</p>
<p>like a physics type science?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think economics will ever be very predictive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most useful for helping you ask better questions.</p>
<p>You look at something like game theory.</p>
<p>Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR</p>
<p>would have a war, would not have a war.</p>
<p>But trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict,</p>
<p>if you know game theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a much more interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Are you surprised that we,</p>
<p>speaking of the Soviet Union and the United States</p>
<p>and speaking of game theory,</p>
<p>are you surprised that we haven&rsquo;t destroyed ourselves</p>
<p>with nuclear weapons yet?</p>
<p>Like that simple formulation</p>
<p>of mutually assured destruction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good example of an explanation</p>
<p>that perhaps allows us to ask better questions.</p>
<p>But it seems to have actually described the reality</p>
<p>of why we haven&rsquo;t destroyed ourselves</p>
<p>with these ultra powerful weapons.</p>
<p>Are you surprised, do you think</p>
<p>the game theoretic explanation is at all accurate there?</p>
<p>I think we will destroy each other with those weapons.</p>
<p>Eventually.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s a very low probability event.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not surprised it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised it came as close as it did.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re general thinking,</p>
<p>realizing it might&rsquo;ve just been a flock of birds</p>
<p>or it wasn&rsquo;t a first strike attack from the USA.</p>
<p>We got very lucky on that one.</p>
<p>But if you just keep on running the clock</p>
<p>on a low probability event, it will happen.</p>
<p>And it may not be USA and China,</p>
<p>USA and Russia, whatever.</p>
<p>You know, it could be the Saudis and Turkey.</p>
<p>And it might not be nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>it might be some other destruction.</p>
<p>Bio weapons.</p>
<p>But it simply will happen is my view.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve argued at best we have 700 or 800 years</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s being generous.</p>
<p>A worst?</p>
<p>How long we got?</p>
<p>Well, maybe it&rsquo;s like a post on arrival process, right?</p>
<p>So tiny probability could come any time.</p>
<p>Probably not in your lifetime.</p>
<p>But the chance presumably increases</p>
<p>the cheaper weapons of mass destruction are.</p>
<p>So the Poisson process description doesn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>in consideration the game theoretic aspect.</p>
<p>So another way to consider is repeated games,</p>
<p>iterative games.</p>
<p>So is there something about our human nature</p>
<p>that allows us to fight against probability?</p>
<p>Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;re able to figure out how to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>The same thing is for when you take exams</p>
<p>or you go and take classes,</p>
<p>the closer or paper deadlines,</p>
<p>the closer you get to a deadline,</p>
<p>the better you start to perform</p>
<p>and get your shit together and actually get stuff done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not so negative on human nature.</p>
<p>And as an economist,</p>
<p>I very much see the gains from cooperation.</p>
<p>But if you just ask, are there outliers in history?</p>
<p>Like was there a Hitler, for instance?</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>And again, you let the clock tick,</p>
<p>another Hitler with nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t per se care about his own destruction,</p>
<p>it will happen.</p>
<p>So your sense is fundamentally people are good,</p>
<p>but outliers happen.</p>
<p>A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it.</p>
<p>Trembling hand equilibrium?</p>
<p>That the basic logic is for cooperation,</p>
<p>which is mostly what we&rsquo;ve seen, even between enemies.</p>
<p>But every now and then someone does something crazy</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know how to react to it.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t always beat Hitler.</p>
<p>Sometimes Hitler drags you down.</p>
<p>To push back, is it possible</p>
<p>that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,</p>
<p>and in a way where we&rsquo;re safe,</p>
<p>meaning like, this is the kind of proposition,</p>
<p>I had the discussion with my dad as a physicist about this,</p>
<p>where he thinks that like if you have a graph,</p>
<p>like evil people can&rsquo;t also be geniuses.</p>
<p>So this is his defense why evil people</p>
<p>will not get control of nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>because to be truly evil.</p>
<p>But evil meaning sort of, you can argue that,</p>
<p>not even the evil of Hitler we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany</p>
<p>and all those kinds of, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he probably deluded himself and the people around him</p>
<p>to think that he&rsquo;s actually doing good for the world,</p>
<p>similar with Stalin and so on.</p>
<p>By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists</p>
<p>to where they wanna destroy themselves and the world.</p>
<p>Like those people will never be able to be</p>
<p>actually skilled enough to do,</p>
<p>to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction.</p>
<p>So the hope is that it&rsquo;s very unlikely</p>
<p>that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions</p>
<p>of humans or mass destruction is so unlikely</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely.</p>
<p>In that sense, I accept the argument,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why you need to let the clock tick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the best argument for bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To negotiate a bureaucracy,</p>
<p>it actually selects against pure evil</p>
<p>because you need to build alliances.</p>
<p>So bureaucracy in that regard is great, right?</p>
<p>It keeps out the worst apples.</p>
<p>But look, put it this way,</p>
<p>could you imagine 35 years from now,</p>
<p>the Osama bin Laden of the future</p>
<p>has nukes or very bad bio weapons?</p>
<p>It seems to me you can.</p>
<p>And Osama was pretty evil.</p>
<p>And actually even he failed, right?</p>
<p>But nonetheless, that&rsquo;s what the 700 or 800 years</p>
<p>is there for.</p>
<p>And there might be destructive technologies</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have such a high cost of production</p>
<p>or such a high learning curve.</p>
<p>Like cyber attacks or artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you could as an act of will,</p>
<p>by spending a million dollars,</p>
<p>obliterate any city on earth and everyone in it dies.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get caught and you&rsquo;ll be sentenced to death,</p>
<p>but you can make it happen just by willing it.</p>
<p>How many months does it take before that happens?</p>
<p>So the obvious answer is like very soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a good answer for that</p>
<p>because you can consider how many millionaires there are,</p>
<p>how many you could look at that, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I have a sense that there&rsquo;s just people</p>
<p>that have a million dollars.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain amount,</p>
<p>but have a million dollars,</p>
<p>have other interests that will outweigh</p>
<p>the interest of destroying an entire city.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a particular,</p>
<p>like, I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s a hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we should be nice to the wealthy too, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, all that trash talking as Bill Gates,</p>
<p>we should stop that</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t inspire the other future Bill Gates</p>
<p>is to be nice to the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But your sense is the cheaper it gets to destroy the world,</p>
<p>the more likely it becomes.</p>
<p>Now, when I say destroy the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trick in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think literally every human will die,</p>
<p>but it would set back civilization</p>
<p>by an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s then just hard to predict what comes next.</p>
<p>But a catastrophe where everyone dies,</p>
<p>that probably has to be something more like an asteroid</p>
<p>or supernova.</p>
<p>And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.</p>
<p>So I immigrated to this country.</p>
<p>I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia and&hellip;</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s an important question.</p>
<p>You were born in the Soviet Union, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.</p>
<p>But I came to this country,</p>
<p>and this country even back there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always symbolized to me a place of opportunity</p>
<p>where everybody could build the most incredible things,</p>
<p>especially in the engineering side of things.</p>
<p>Just invent and build and scale</p>
<p>and have a huge impact on the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been, to me, the&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my version of the American ideal, the American dream.</p>
<p>Do you think the American dream is still there?</p>
<p>Do you think&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you think of that notion in itself,</p>
<p>like from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>from a human perspective, is it still alive?</p>
<p>And how do you think about it?</p>
<p>The American dream.</p>
<p>The American dream is mostly still there.</p>
<p>If you look at which groups are the highest earners,</p>
<p>it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran,</p>
<p>which is a fairly new development.</p>
<p>Great for them, not necessarily easy.</p>
<p>Both you could call persons of color,</p>
<p>may have faced discrimination,</p>
<p>also on the grounds of religion, yet they&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It says great things about America.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at native born Americans,</p>
<p>the story&rsquo;s trickier.</p>
<p>People think intergenerational mobility</p>
<p>has declined a lot recently,</p>
<p>but it has not for native born Americans.</p>
<p>For about, I think, 40 years, it&rsquo;s been fairly constant,</p>
<p>which is sort of good,</p>
<p>but compared to much earlier times,</p>
<p>it was much higher in the past.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we can replicate that,</p>
<p>because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>very few Americans finish high school,</p>
<p>or even have much wealth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much credentialism.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many credentials.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more upward mobility</p>
<p>across the generations than today.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good thing that we had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we should blame the modern world</p>
<p>for not being able to reproduce that.</p>
<p>But look, the general issue of</p>
<p>who gets into Harvard or Cornell?</p>
<p>Is there an injustice?</p>
<p>Should we fix that?</p>
<p>Is there too little opportunity for the bottom,</p>
<p>say, half of Americans?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way.</p>
<p>And in that sense, the American dream is clearly ailing.</p>
<p>But it has had problems from the beginning,</p>
<p>for blacks, for women, for many other groups.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t that the whole challenge of opportunity</p>
<p>and freedom is that it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>and the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society</p>
<p>is unequal often, and that&rsquo;s the injustice of society.</p>
<p>But the whole point of that freedom</p>
<p>is that over time, it becomes better and better.</p>
<p>You start to fix the leaks, the issues,</p>
<p>and it keeps progressing in that kind of way.</p>
<p>But ultimately, there&rsquo;s always the opportunity,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s harder, there&rsquo;s the opportunity</p>
<p>to create something truly special,</p>
<p>to move up, to be president, to be a leader</p>
<p>in whatever the industry that you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>We each have podcasts, right, in English.</p>
<p>The value of joining that American English language network</p>
<p>is much higher today than it was 30 years ago,</p>
<p>mostly because of the internet.</p>
<p>So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed.</p>
<p>So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,</p>
<p>I think has become much more valuable in relative terms</p>
<p>than, say, going to France,</p>
<p>which is still a pretty well off, very nice country.</p>
<p>If you had gone to France,</p>
<p>your chance of having a globally known podcast</p>
<p>would be much smaller.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the interesting thing</p>
<p>about how much intellectual influence</p>
<p>the United States has.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s connected to what we&rsquo;re discussing here,</p>
<p>the freedom and opportunity of the American dream,</p>
<p>or does it make any sense to you</p>
<p>that we have so much impact on the rest of the world</p>
<p>in terms of ideas?</p>
<p>Is it just simply because English</p>
<p>is the primary language of the world,</p>
<p>or is there something fundamental to the United States</p>
<p>that drives the development of ideas?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like what&rsquo;s cool, what&rsquo;s entertaining,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s like meme culture, the internet culture,</p>
<p>the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts,</p>
<p>the movies, music, all that stuff, driving culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something above and beyond language</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sense of entertainment really mattering,</p>
<p>how to connect with your audience,</p>
<p>being direct and getting to the point,</p>
<p>how humor is integrated even with science</p>
<p>that is pretty strongly represented here,</p>
<p>much more so than on the European continent.</p>
<p>Britain has its own version of this,</p>
<p>which it does very well,</p>
<p>and not surprisingly, they&rsquo;re hugely influential</p>
<p>in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mentioned.</p>
<p>Canada, yes, but their best talent tends to come here,</p>
<p>but you could say it&rsquo;s like a broader North American thing</p>
<p>and give them their fair share of credit.</p>
<p>What about science?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense higher education is really strong,</p>
<p>research is really strong in the United States,</p>
<p>but it just feels like, culturally speaking,</p>
<p>when we zoom out, scientists aren&rsquo;t very cool here.</p>
<p>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to name</p>
<p>basically a single scientist.</p>
<p>Maybe they would say like, they would say what,</p>
<p>like Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson maybe,</p>
<p>and Neil deGrasse Tyson isn&rsquo;t exactly a scientist,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a science communicator.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not the same kind of admiration</p>
<p>of science and innovators as there is of like,</p>
<p>athletes or actors, actresses, musicians.</p>
<p>Well, you can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.</p>
<p>It may or may not be best for science.</p>
<p>And we have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,</p>
<p>but look at it this way.</p>
<p>Which country is most comfortable</p>
<p>with inegalitarian rewards for scientists,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s fame or money?</p>
<p>And I still think it&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Some of that&rsquo;s just the tax rate.</p>
<p>Some of it is a lot of America is set up</p>
<p>for rich people to live really well.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s going to attract a lot of top talent.</p>
<p>And you ask like, the two best vaccines.</p>
<p>I know the Pfizer vaccine is sort of from Germany,</p>
<p>sort of from Turkey, but it&rsquo;s nonetheless</p>
<p>being distributed through the United States.</p>
<p>Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through Lebanon,</p>
<p>first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area.</p>
<p>Those are incredible vaccines.</p>
<p>And US nailed it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s more almost like the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you would call it,</p>
<p>engineering, the sort of scaling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what US is really good at,</p>
<p>not just inventing of ideas,</p>
<p>but taking an idea and actually building the thing</p>
<p>and scaling it and being able to distribute it at scale.</p>
<p>I think some people would attribute that</p>
<p>to the general word of capitalism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you would.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s implemented in America?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you would say</p>
<p>capitalism really exists in America,</p>
<p>but to the extent that it does.</p>
<p>People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.</p>
<p>What is capitalism?</p>
<p>The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,</p>
<p>which I favor in most areas.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t think the private sector</p>
<p>should own our F16s or military assets.</p>
<p>Government owned water utilities seem to work</p>
<p>as well as privately owned water utilities.</p>
<p>But with all those qualifications put to the side,</p>
<p>business, for the most part,</p>
<p>innovates better than government.</p>
<p>It is oriented toward consumer services.</p>
<p>The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages.</p>
<p>Business is great at getting things done.</p>
<p>USA is fundamentally a nation of business</p>
<p>and that makes us a nation of opportunity.</p>
<p>So I am indeed mostly a fan.</p>
<p>Subject to numerous caveats.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the con?</p>
<p>What are some negative downsides of capitalism</p>
<p>in your view or some things that we should be concerned</p>
<p>about maybe for longterm impacts of capitalism?</p>
<p>Again, capitalism takes a different form in each country.</p>
<p>I would say in the United States,</p>
<p>our weird blend of whatever you want to call it</p>
<p>has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,</p>
<p>has been a force of taking away land</p>
<p>from Native Americans and oppressing them</p>
<p>pretty much from the beginning.</p>
<p>It has done very well by immigrants for the most part.</p>
<p>We revel in championitarian creative destruction more.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t just prop up national champions forever.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a precariousness to life for some people here</p>
<p>that is less so say in Germany or the Netherlands.</p>
<p>We have weaker communities in some regards</p>
<p>than say Northwestern Europe often would.</p>
<p>That has pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>I think it makes us more creative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a better country in which to be a weirdo</p>
<p>than say Germany or Denmark.</p>
<p>But there is truly, whether from the government</p>
<p>or from your private community,</p>
<p>there is less social security in some fundamental sense.</p>
<p>On the point of weirdo,</p>
<p>what, that&rsquo;s kind of a beautiful little statement.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I mean, that seems to be, you know,</p>
<p>you could think of a guy like Elon Musk</p>
<p>and say that he&rsquo;s a weirdo.</p>
<p>Is that the sense in which you&rsquo;re using weirdo</p>
<p>like outside of the norm, like breaking conventions?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And here that is either acceptable or even admired</p>
<p>or to be a loner.</p>
<p>And since so many people are outsiders</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re all immigrants is selecting for people</p>
<p>who left something behind,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to leave behind their families,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to undergo a certain brutality</p>
<p>of switch in their lives,</p>
<p>makes us a nation of weirdos and weirdos are creative.</p>
<p>And Denmark is not a nation of weirdos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful place, you know, great for them.</p>
<p>Ideally you want part of the world</p>
<p>to be full of weirdos and innovating.</p>
<p>And the other part of the world to be a little</p>
<p>kind of chicken shit, risk averse</p>
<p>and enjoy the benefit to the innovation</p>
<p>and to give people these smooth lives</p>
<p>and six weeks off and free ride.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, oh, American way versus European way,</p>
<p>but basically they&rsquo;re compliments.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I used to have this conversation with my like parents</p>
<p>when I was growing up and just others</p>
<p>from the immigrant kind of flow.</p>
<p>And they use this term, especially in Russian is,</p>
<p>you know, to criticize something I was doing,</p>
<p>that was suggest, you know, normal people don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And I used to be really offended by that,</p>
<p>but, you know, as I got older,</p>
<p>I realized that that&rsquo;s a kind of compliment</p>
<p>because in the same kind of, I would say,</p>
<p>way that you&rsquo;re saying that is the American ideal,</p>
<p>because if you want to do anything special or interesting,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be doing in one particular avenue</p>
<p>what normal people do, because that won&rsquo;t be interesting.</p>
<p>Russians, I think fit in very well here</p>
<p>because the ones who come are weirdos.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very different Russian weirdo tradition</p>
<p>like Alyosha, right?</p>
<p>And by this card, I miss off.</p>
<p>Or Perelman, the mathematician, they&rsquo;re weirdos.</p>
<p>And they have their own different kind of status</p>
<p>in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.</p>
<p>And when Russians come to America,</p>
<p>they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve somehow adjusted.</p>
<p>And the ways in which they might want to be like grumpier</p>
<p>than Americans, not smile,</p>
<p>think that people who smile are idiots,</p>
<p>like they can do that.</p>
<p>No one takes that away from them.</p>
<p>What are you, on a tiny tangent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have thoughts</p>
<p>about Grisha Perelman turning down the Fields Medal.</p>
<p>Is that something you admire?</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you that somebody,</p>
<p>you know, with the structure of Nobel Prizes,</p>
<p>of these huge awards, of the reputations,</p>
<p>the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding,</p>
<p>how special you are, and here&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>who was doing one of the greatest accomplishments</p>
<p>in the history of mathematics.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t want the stupid prize</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t want recognition,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to do interviews,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t want to be famous.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Look, prizes are corrupting.</p>
<p>After scientists win Nobel Prizes,</p>
<p>they tend to become less productive.</p>
<p>Now, statistically, it&rsquo;s hard to sort out</p>
<p>the different effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s aggression toward the mean.</p>
<p>Does the prize make you too busy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tricky, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough Nobel Prizes either</p>
<p>to gather enough data.</p>
<p>Right, but I&rsquo;ve known a lot of Nobel Prize winners,</p>
<p>and it is my sense they become less productive.</p>
<p>They repeat more of their older messages,</p>
<p>which may be highly socially valuable,</p>
<p>but if someone wants to turn their back on that</p>
<p>and keep on working, which I assume is what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, we should respect that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he wins a bigger prize, right?</p>
<p>Our extreme respect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Grisha, if you&rsquo;re listening, I need to talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get ahold of him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Back to capitalism.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, just competition in general,</p>
<p>in this world of weirdos,</p>
<p>is competition good for the world?</p>
<p>This kind of seems to be one of the fundamental engines</p>
<p>of capitalism, right?</p>
<p>Do you see it as ultimately constructive</p>
<p>or destructive for the world?</p>
<p>What really matters is how good your legal framework is.</p>
<p>So competition within nature for food</p>
<p>leads to bloody conflict all the time.</p>
<p>The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the least.</p>
<p>If you have something like the rule of law</p>
<p>and clearly defined property rights,</p>
<p>which are within reason justly allocated,</p>
<p>competition probably is gonna work very well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not an unalloyed good thing at all.</p>
<p>It can be highly destructive.</p>
<p>Military competition, right?</p>
<p>Which actually is itself sometimes good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not good per se.</p>
<p>What aspects of life do you think</p>
<p>we should protect from competition?</p>
<p>Is there some, you said like the rule of law,</p>
<p>is there some things we should keep away from competition?</p>
<p>Well, the fight for territory, most of all, right?</p>
<p>So violence, anything that involves</p>
<p>like actual physical violence.</p>
<p>Right, and it&rsquo;s not that I think</p>
<p>the current borders are just.</p>
<p>I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians,</p>
<p>Serbians, Bosnians, they&rsquo;ll talk your ear off.</p>
<p>And some of them are probably right.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>we have some kind of international order.</p>
<p>And I would rather we more or less stick with it.</p>
<p>If Catalonians wanna leave, they keep up with it,</p>
<p>let them go, but.</p>
<p>What about a space of like healthcare?</p>
<p>This is where you get into a tension of like</p>
<p>between capitalism and kind of more,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna use socialism,</p>
<p>but those kinds of policies that are less free market.</p>
<p>I think in this country,</p>
<p>healthcare should be much more competitive.</p>
<p>So you go to hospitals, doctors,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t treat you like a customer.</p>
<p>They treat you like an idiot or like a child</p>
<p>or someone with third party payment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty humiliating experience often.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think a free market in general is possible?</p>
<p>Like a pure free market?</p>
<p>And is that a good goal to strive for?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the term pure free market&rsquo;s well defined</p>
<p>because you need a legal order.</p>
<p>Legal order has to make decisions</p>
<p>on like what is intellectual property</p>
<p>more important than ever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no benchmark that like represents</p>
<p>the pure free market way of doing things.</p>
<p>What will penalties be?</p>
<p>How much do we put into law enforcement?</p>
<p>No simple answers, but just saying free market</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pin down what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>on those all important questions.</p>
<p>So free market is an economics, I guess, idea.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not possible for free market to generate the rules</p>
<p>that are like emergent, like self governing?</p>
<p>It generates a lot of them, right?</p>
<p>Through private norms, through trade associations.</p>
<p>International trade is mostly done privately and by norms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s certainly possible, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think you need governments to draw very clear lines</p>
<p>to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been hanging out with other group of weirdos,</p>
<p>lately Michael Malice, who espouses to be an anarchist,</p>
<p>anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually</p>
<p>just a fascinating set of ideas, where taking free market</p>
<p>to the full extreme of basically saying</p>
<p>there should be no government, what is it?</p>
<p>Oversight, I guess, and then everything should be fully,</p>
<p>like all the agreements, all the collectives you form</p>
<p>should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land</p>
<p>you were born on and so on.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s just a giant mess?</p>
<p>Like, do you think it&rsquo;s possible for an anarchist society</p>
<p>to work where it&rsquo;s, you know, in a fully distributed way,</p>
<p>people agree with each other,</p>
<p>not just on financial transactions,</p>
<p>but you know, on their personal security,</p>
<p>on sort of military type of stuff, on healthcare,</p>
<p>on education, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And where does it break down?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t press a button to say get rid</p>
<p>of our current constitution, which I view is pretty good</p>
<p>and quite wise, but I think the deeper point</p>
<p>is that all societies are in some regards anarchistic</p>
<p>and we should take the anarchists seriously.</p>
<p>So globally, there&rsquo;s a kind of anarchy across borders,</p>
<p>even within federalistic systems, they&rsquo;re typically complex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a clear transitivity necessarily</p>
<p>of who has the final say over what,</p>
<p>just the state vis a vis its people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not per se a final arbitrator in that regard.</p>
<p>So you want a good anarchy rather than a bad anarchy.</p>
<p>You wanna squish your anarchy into the right corners.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a theoretical answer</p>
<p>how to do it, but you start with a country,</p>
<p>like is it working well enough now?</p>
<p>This country, you&rsquo;d say mostly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d certainly wanna make a lot of improvements.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t wanna press that</p>
<p>get rid of the constitution button,</p>
<p>but to just dump on the anarchists is to miss the point.</p>
<p>Always try to learn from any opinion.</p>
<p>What in it is true?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like marveling at the poetry</p>
<p>of saying that we should squish our anarchy</p>
<p>into the right corners of it.</p>
<p>Okay, I gotta ask, I&rsquo;ve been talking with,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re doing a whirlwind introduction</p>
<p>to all of economics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to a few objectivists recently</p>
<p>and just, Ayn Rand comes up as a person,</p>
<p>as a philosopher throughout many conversations.</p>
<p>A lot of people really despise her.</p>
<p>A lot of people really love her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always weird to me when somebody arouses a philosophy</p>
<p>or a human being arouses that much emotion</p>
<p>in either direction, does she make,</p>
<p>do you understand, first of all, that level of emotion</p>
<p>and what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand</p>
<p>and her philosophy of objectivism?</p>
<p>Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation</p>
<p>of a rational self interest,</p>
<p>if I could put it in those words,</p>
<p>or I guess more negatively the selfishness</p>
<p>or she would put, I guess, the virtue of selfishness.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand was a big influence on me growing up.</p>
<p>The book that really mattered for me was</p>
<p>Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal.</p>
<p>The notion that wealth creates opportunity</p>
<p>and good lives and wealth is something we ought to valorize</p>
<p>and give very high status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of her key ideas.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s completely correct.</p>
<p>I think she has the most profound</p>
<p>and articulate statement of that idea.</p>
<p>That said, as a philosopher,</p>
<p>I disagree with her on most things.</p>
<p>And I did, even like as a boy, when I was reading her,</p>
<p>I read Plato before Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>And in a Socratic dialogue,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these different points of view</p>
<p>being thrown around.</p>
<p>And whomever it is you agree with,</p>
<p>you understand the wisdom is in the coming together</p>
<p>of the different points of view.</p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So altruism can be wonderful in my view.</p>
<p>Humans are not actually that rational.</p>
<p>Self interest is often poorly defined.</p>
<p>To pound the table and say existence exists.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I disagree,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s a very meaningful statement.</p>
<p>I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have her on my podcast if she was still alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d only ask her about Russia,</p>
<p>which she mostly never talked about</p>
<p>after writing We the Living.</p>
<p>And she is much more Russian than she seems at first,</p>
<p>even like purging people from the objectivist circles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how Russians, especially female Russians,</p>
<p>so often purge their friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, all the parallels.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying, so yes,</p>
<p>so assuming she&rsquo;s still not around,</p>
<p>but if she is and she comes onto your podcast,</p>
<p>can you dig into that a little bit?</p>
<p>Do you mean like her personal demons</p>
<p>around the social and economic Russia of the time,</p>
<p>when she escaped?</p>
<p>The traumas she suffered there,</p>
<p>what she really likes in the music and literature and why.</p>
<p>Music and literature, huh?</p>
<p>And getting deeply into that,</p>
<p>her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,</p>
<p>how it differs from America,</p>
<p>why she still carries through the old Russian vision</p>
<p>in her fiction, this extreme sexual dimorphism,</p>
<p>but with also very strong women,</p>
<p>to me is a uniquely, at least Eastern European vision,</p>
<p>mostly Russian, I would say.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in her, that&rsquo;s her actual real philosophy,</p>
<p>not this table bounding existence exists.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not talked about enough.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a Russian philosopher.</p>
<p>Or Soviet, whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>And if she wasn&rsquo;t so certain,</p>
<p>she could have been a Dostoevsky where it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that certainty is almost the thing</p>
<p>that brings out the adoration of millions,</p>
<p>but also the hatred of millions.</p>
<p>She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian like manner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>But I love the idea that, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just dropping bombs that are poetic,</p>
<p>that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think</p>
<p>that no one human possesses wisdom.</p>
<p>No one idea is the wisdom.</p>
<p>That the coming together is the wisdom.</p>
<p>Like in my view, Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson,</p>
<p>18th century British biography.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in essence a coauthored work, Boswell and Johnson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest philosophy books ever,</p>
<p>though it is commonly regarded as a biography.</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill, who in a sense</p>
<p>was coauthoring with Harriet Taylor,</p>
<p>better philosopher than is realized,</p>
<p>though he&rsquo;s rated very, very highly.</p>
<p>Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works</p>
<p>are in a kind of dialogue form.</p>
<p>Curtis Faust would be another example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much a dialogue.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s drama, but it&rsquo;s also a philosophy.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.</p>
<p>In your book, Big Business, speaking of Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>Big Business, A Love Letter to an American Antihero,</p>
<p>you make the case for the benefit</p>
<p>that large businesses bring to society.</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>If you look at, say, the pandemic,</p>
<p>which has been a catastrophic event, right,</p>
<p>for many reasons, but who is it that saved us?</p>
<p>So Amazon has done remarkably well.</p>
<p>They upped their delivery game more or less overnight</p>
<p>with very few hitches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,</p>
<p>direct delivery food, whether it&rsquo;s DoorDash or Uber Eats,</p>
<p>or using Whole Foods through Amazon shipping.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s gone remarkably well.</p>
<p>Switching over our entire higher educational system,</p>
<p>basically within two weeks, to Zoom.</p>
<p>Zoom did it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had a Zoom outage,</p>
<p>but their performance rate has been remarkably high.</p>
<p>So if you just look at resources, competence, incentives,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been the star performers, the NBA even,</p>
<p>just canceling the season as early as they did,</p>
<p>sending a message like, hey, people, this is real,</p>
<p>and then pulling off the bubble</p>
<p>with not a single found case of COVID</p>
<p>and having all the testing set up in advance.</p>
<p>Big business has done very well lately,</p>
<p>and throughout the broader course of American history,</p>
<p>in my view, has mostly been a hero.</p>
<p>Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often troubled by the negativity towards big business,</p>
<p>and I wonder if you could help figure out</p>
<p>how we remove that or maybe first psychoanalyze it</p>
<p>and then how we remove it.</p>
<p>It feels like once we&rsquo;ve gotten wifi on flights,</p>
<p>on airplane flights, people started complaining</p>
<p>about how shady the connection is, right?</p>
<p>They take it for granted immediately</p>
<p>and then start complaining about little details.</p>
<p>Another example that&rsquo;s closer to,</p>
<p>especially as an aspiring entrepreneur,</p>
<p>is closer to the things I&rsquo;m thinking about</p>
<p>is Jack Dorsey with Twitter.</p>
<p>To me, Twitter has enabled</p>
<p>an incredible platform of communication,</p>
<p>and yet the biggest thing that people talk about</p>
<p>is not how incredible this platform is.</p>
<p>They essentially use the platform</p>
<p>to complain about the censorship of a few individuals</p>
<p>as opposed to how amazing it is.</p>
<p>Now, you should talk about how shady the wifi is</p>
<p>and how censorship or the removal of Donald Trump</p>
<p>from the platform is a bad thing,</p>
<p>but it feels like we don&rsquo;t talk about the positive impacts</p>
<p>at scale of these technologies.</p>
<p>Can you explain why and is there a way to fix it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we can fix it.</p>
<p>I think we are beings of high neuroticism for the most part</p>
<p>as a personality trait.</p>
<p>Not everyone, but most people.</p>
<p>And as a compliment to that,</p>
<p>if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more bothered by the insult</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re pleased by the nice things,</p>
<p>especially if the insult is somewhat true.</p>
<p>So you have these media, these vehicles,</p>
<p>Twitter is one you mentioned,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s all kinds of messages going back and forth,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really bugged by the messages you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Most people are neurotic to begin with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only taken out on big business, to be clear.</p>
<p>So Congress catches a lot of grief</p>
<p>and some of it they deserve, yes.</p>
<p>Religion is not attacked the same way,</p>
<p>but religiosity is declining.</p>
<p>If you poll people, the military still polls quite well,</p>
<p>but people are very disillusioned with many things.</p>
<p>And the Martin Gury thesis that because of the internet,</p>
<p>you just see more of things.</p>
<p>And the more you see of something,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s good, bad, or in between,</p>
<p>the more you will find to complain about,</p>
<p>I suspect is the fundamental mechanism here.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s a great service, may or may not be like my thing,</p>
<p>but gives people this opportunity.</p>
<p>No one makes you go on it.</p>
<p>And all these media articles like,</p>
<p>oh, is Clubhouse gonna wreck things?</p>
<p>Are they gonna break things?</p>
<p>New York Times is complaining.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s their competitor as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, give these people a chance, talk it up.</p>
<p>You may or may not like it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s praise the people who are getting something done.</p>
<p>Very Ayn Randian point.</p>
<p>As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster,</p>
<p>what do you think about Clubhouse?</p>
<p>What do you think about&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it.</p>
<p>I used to use Discord, which is another service</p>
<p>where people use voice.</p>
<p>So the only thing you do is just hear each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no face, you just see a little icon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essential element of Clubhouse.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an intimacy to voice only communication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t make sense to me, but it was just what it is,</p>
<p>which feels like something that won&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>for some reason, maybe it&rsquo;s the cynical view.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your sense about the intimacy</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening right now with Clubhouse?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve greatly enjoyed what I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s for me in the long run</p>
<p>for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, if you compare it to doing a podcast,</p>
<p>podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.</p>
<p>So I would rather put time into my podcast.</p>
<p>But then also my core asset, so to speak,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m a very fast reader.</p>
<p>So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak or listen faster than other people.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m a slower listener because I like 1.0,</p>
<p>not 1.5X.</p>
<p>So I should spend less time on audio</p>
<p>and more time reading and writing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting because you mentioned podcasts</p>
<p>and audio books, the podcasts are recorded</p>
<p>and so I can skip things, like I can skip commercials,</p>
<p>or I can skip parts where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>ugh, this part is boring.</p>
<p>With live conversations, especially when,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magic to the fact when you have a lot of people</p>
<p>participating in that conversation,</p>
<p>but some people are like, ugh, this topic,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going into this thing and you can&rsquo;t skip it</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t fast forward, you can go 1.5X or 2X,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t speed it up.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there&rsquo;s a tension between that,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the productivity aspect,</p>
<p>with the actual magic of live communication,</p>
<p>where anything can happen, where Elon Musk</p>
<p>can ask the CEO of Robinhood, Vlad, about like,</p>
<p>hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something shady going on, the magic of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also my criticism of like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a recent conversation with Bill Gates</p>
<p>that he won a platform and had a regular interview</p>
<p>on the platform without allowing the possibility</p>
<p>of the magic of the chaos.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not exactly sure, it&rsquo;s probably not the right</p>
<p>platform for you and for many other people</p>
<p>who are exceptionally productive in other places,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still nevertheless a magic to the chaos</p>
<p>that can be created with live conversation</p>
<p>that gives me pause.</p>
<p>Maybe what it&rsquo;s perfect for is the tribute.</p>
<p>So they had an episode recently that I didn&rsquo;t hear,</p>
<p>but I heard it was wonderful.</p>
<p>It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t do one to one, right?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want control.</p>
<p>You want different people appearing and stepping up</p>
<p>and saying their bit.</p>
<p>And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that.</p>
<p>The tribute.</p>
<p>I love that, the tribute.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the possibility,</p>
<p>I think there was a time when somebody arranged</p>
<p>a conversation with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage.</p>
<p>I remember that happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>And it was very formal.</p>
<p>It could have probably gone better,</p>
<p>but it was still magical to have these people</p>
<p>that obviously had a bunch of tension</p>
<p>throughout their history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so frictionless to have two major figures</p>
<p>in world history just jump on a Clubhouse stage.</p>
<p>Putin and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a language barrier there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the problem that in particular,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Biden would have a similar problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just not into a new technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to catch the Kremlin up to,</p>
<p>first of all, Twitter,</p>
<p>but to catch them up to Clubhouse,</p>
<p>you have to have the,</p>
<p>Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,</p>
<p>the humor, the memes, and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that you have to have in order to use a new app</p>
<p>and figure out the timing, the beat,</p>
<p>what is this thing about?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the challenge there.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>That magic of have two big personalities just show up.</p>
<p>And I wonder if it&rsquo;s just the temporary thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going through with the pandemic</p>
<p>where people are just lonely</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re seeking for that human connection</p>
<p>that we usually get elsewhere through our work.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll stay lonely, in my opinion.</p>
<p>You think so? I do.</p>
<p>So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist.</p>
<p>And the idea of wanting to be connected</p>
<p>to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that.</p>
<p>And all the mental health issues out there,</p>
<p>a lot of people have broken ties</p>
<p>and they will still be lonely post vaccines.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, from an artificial intelligence perspective,</p>
<p>have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness</p>
<p>in the world, that all of us are really lonely.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t even acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Even people in happy relationships,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s like an iceberg of loneliness</p>
<p>in all of us, like seeking to be understood,</p>
<p>like deeply understood, understanding us,</p>
<p>like having somebody with whom you can have</p>
<p>a deep interaction enough to where you can,</p>
<p>they can help you to understand yourself</p>
<p>and they also understand you.</p>
<p>Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>can provide that as well, but humans,</p>
<p>I think crave that from other humans</p>
<p>in ways that we perhaps don&rsquo;t acknowledge.</p>
<p>And I have a hope that technology will enable that</p>
<p>more and more, like Clubhouse is an example</p>
<p>that allows that.</p>
<p>Are touring bots gonna out compete Clubhouse?</p>
<p>Like why not sort of program your own session?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just talk into your device</p>
<p>and say here&rsquo;s the kind of conversation I want</p>
<p>and it will create the characters for you.</p>
<p>And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Yeah, and one of the things that&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just conversation, it&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>So longterm memories, what current AI systems don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>is sharing experience together.</p>
<p>Forget the words, it&rsquo;s like sharing the highs</p>
<p>and the lows of life together</p>
<p>and the systems around us remembering that.</p>
<p>Remembering we&rsquo;ve been through that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the thing that creates</p>
<p>really close relationships, is going through some shit.</p>
<p>Like struggle.</p>
<p>If you survive together, there&rsquo;s something really difficult</p>
<p>that bonds you with other humans.</p>
<p>And this is related to immigration and the American dream.</p>
<p>In what way?</p>
<p>The people who have come to this country,</p>
<p>however weird and different they may be,</p>
<p>they or their ancestors at some point</p>
<p>probably have shared this thing.</p>
<p>Right, US is not gonna split up.</p>
<p>It may get more screwed up as a country,</p>
<p>but Texas and California are not gonna break off.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re big enough where they could do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just never gonna happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through too much together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a hopeful message.</p>
<p>Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked to Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>He has a sense that growth,</p>
<p>like the entirety of the American system</p>
<p>is based on the assumption that we&rsquo;re gonna grow forever,</p>
<p>that the economy&rsquo;s gonna grow forever.</p>
<p>Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely?</p>
<p>Or will we stagnate?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been in agreement with Eric, Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>Robert Gordon and others, that growth has slowed down.</p>
<p>I argued that in my book,</p>
<p>The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled.</p>
<p>But the last two years, I&rsquo;ve become much more optimistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of breakthroughs</p>
<p>in green energy and battery technology.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already.</p>
<p>It will repair our GDP</p>
<p>and save millions of lives around the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an anti malaria vaccine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now in stage three trial, it probably works.</p>
<p>CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia.</p>
<p>Just space, area after area after area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s suddenly the surge of breakthroughs.</p>
<p>I would say many of them rooted in superior computation</p>
<p>and ultimately Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>and access to those computational abilities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m much more optimistic than say,</p>
<p>the last time I spoke to Eric.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, he moves all the time in his views.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>His views, I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s at now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not at, he hasn&rsquo;t gained, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So your little drop of optimism comes from like,</p>
<p>there might be a fundamental shift</p>
<p>in the kind of things that computation has unlocked for us</p>
<p>in terms of like, it could be a wellspring of innovation</p>
<p>that enables growth for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Like Eric has not quite connected</p>
<p>to the computation aspect yet</p>
<p>to where it could be a wellspring of innovation.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re very close to it in your own work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that.</p>
<p>The work you&rsquo;re doing would not have been possible</p>
<p>not very long ago.</p>
<p>But the question is,</p>
<p>how much does that work enable continued growth</p>
<p>for decades to come?</p>
<p>For all their problems,</p>
<p>some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when, you know much better than I do.</p>
<p>Maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal.</p>
<p>Well, one of the open questions</p>
<p>that sort of the Peter Thiel School area of ideas</p>
<p>is how much can be converted to technology?</p>
<p>How much, how many parts of our lives</p>
<p>can technology integrate and then innovate?</p>
<p>Like can it replace healthcare?</p>
<p>Can it replace the legal system?</p>
<p>Can it replace government?</p>
<p>Not replace, but like, you know, make it digital</p>
<p>and thereby enable computation to improve it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the open question,</p>
<p>because many aspects of our lives</p>
<p>are still not really that digitized.</p>
<p>There was a New York Times symposium in April,</p>
<p>which is not long ago.</p>
<p>And they asked the so called experts,</p>
<p>when are we gonna get vaccines?</p>
<p>And the most optimistic answer was in four years.</p>
<p>And obviously we beat that by a long mile.</p>
<p>So I think people still haven&rsquo;t woken up.</p>
<p>You mentioned my tiny drop of optimism,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a big drop of optimism.</p>
<p>Is it a waterfall yet?</p>
<p>I mean, is it just?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s my pessimism.</p>
<p>Whenever there are major new technologies,</p>
<p>they also tend to be used for violence</p>
<p>directly or indirectly, radio, Hitler.</p>
<p>Not that he hit people over the head with radios,</p>
<p>but it enabled the rise of various dictators.</p>
<p>So the new technologies now, whatever exactly they may be,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my pessimism.</p>
<p>Not that I think they&rsquo;re all gonna slow to a trickle.</p>
<p>When was the stagnation book?</p>
<p>2011.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was the first of the stagnation books, in fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But even then I said, this is temporary.</p>
<p>And I was predicting it would be gone</p>
<p>in about 20 years time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s exactly the right prediction,</p>
<p>like 2030, but I think we&rsquo;re actually gonna beat that.</p>
<p>So you think United States might still be</p>
<p>on top of the world for the rest of the century</p>
<p>in terms of its economic growth,</p>
<p>impact on the world, scientific innovation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too long to predict,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m bullish on America in general.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Speaking of being bullish on America,</p>
<p>the opposite of that is,</p>
<p>we talked about capitalism,</p>
<p>we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.</p>
<p>What do you think about communism?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it work?</p>
<p>Is it the implementation?</p>
<p>Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling?</p>
<p>Or is it just a fundamentally flawed system?</p>
<p>Well, communism is like capitalism.</p>
<p>The words mean many things to different people.</p>
<p>You could argue my life as a tenured professor</p>
<p>comes closer to communism than anything</p>
<p>the human race has seen.</p>
<p>And I would argue it works pretty well.</p>
<p>But look, if you mean the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>it devolved pretty quickly</p>
<p>to a kind of decentralized set of incentives</p>
<p>that were destructive rather than value maximizing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even central planning, much less communism.</p>
<p>So Paul Craig Roberts and Polanyi were correct</p>
<p>in their descriptions of the Soviet system.</p>
<p>Think of it as weird mixes of barter</p>
<p>and malfunctioning incentives</p>
<p>and being very good at a whole bunch of things,</p>
<p>but in terms of progress, innovation,</p>
<p>and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure.</p>
<p>And now I wouldn&rsquo;t call that communism,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I think of the system the Soviets had.</p>
<p>And it required an ever increasing pile of lies</p>
<p>that both alienated people, but created an elite</p>
<p>that by the end of the thing</p>
<p>no longer believed in the system itself,</p>
<p>or even thought they were doing better by being crooks</p>
<p>than by just say moving to Switzerland</p>
<p>and being an upper middle class individual,</p>
<p>like you would have a higher standard of living</p>
<p>by Gorbachev&rsquo;s time, not Gorbachev,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re a number 30 in the hierarchy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off as a middle class person in Switzerland.</p>
<p>And that, of course, did not prove sustainable.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, what is it, a momentum of bureaucracy</p>
<p>or something like that, it just builds up</p>
<p>where you lose control of the original vision,</p>
<p>and that naturally happens, it&rsquo;s just people.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t use normal profit and loss</p>
<p>and price incentives, so you get all prices</p>
<p>or most prices set too low, right?</p>
<p>Shortages everywhere, people trade favors,</p>
<p>you have this culture of bartered bribes,</p>
<p>sexual favors or family friends,</p>
<p>and you get more and more of that,</p>
<p>and you over time lose more and more of the information</p>
<p>and the prices and quantities and practices</p>
<p>and norms you had, and that sort of slowly decays,</p>
<p>and then by the end no one is believing in it.</p>
<p>That would be my take, but again, you&rsquo;re the expert here.</p>
<p>The Russian scholar, well, I&rsquo;m perhaps no more</p>
<p>an expert than Ayn Rand, it&rsquo;s more personal</p>
<p>than it is scholarly or historic.</p>
<p>So Stalin held power for 30 years,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,</p>
<p>where you could argue he took a little break.</p>
<p>But not much, he was still holding power, I think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still possible now with the new constitution</p>
<p>that he could hold power from longer than Stalin,</p>
<p>longer than 30 years.</p>
<p>What do you think about the man,</p>
<p>the state of affairs in Russia,</p>
<p>in general, the system they have there?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to you</p>
<p>as an economist, as a human being, about Russia?</p>
<p>Everything is interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, here would be part of my take.</p>
<p>As you know, the Russian economy starting, what, 1999, 2000,</p>
<p>has really quite a few years of super excellent growth.</p>
<p>And Putin is still riding on that.</p>
<p>It more or less coincides with his rise</p>
<p>as the truly focal figure on the scene.</p>
<p>Since then, pretty recently, they&rsquo;ve had a bunch of years</p>
<p>of negative four to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.</p>
<p>The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels,</p>
<p>but the structural problem is this.</p>
<p>You need a concordance across economic power,</p>
<p>social power, political power.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be allocated identically,</p>
<p>but they have to be allocated consistently.</p>
<p>And the Russian system under Putin,</p>
<p>from almost the beginning, has never been able to have that,</p>
<p>that ultimately his incentives are to steer the system</p>
<p>where the economic power is in a small number of hands</p>
<p>in a non diversified way.</p>
<p>The system won&rsquo;t deliver sustainable gains</p>
<p>in living standards anymore ever the way it&rsquo;s set up now.</p>
<p>Though if fossil fuel prices go up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have some good years for sure.</p>
<p>And that is really quite structural, what has gone wrong.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, you can have an opinion of Putin,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got to start with those structural problems.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s just not going to work.</p>
<p>But he had all those good years in the beginning.</p>
<p>So the number of Russians, say, who live here</p>
<p>or in Russia, who love Putin and it&rsquo;s sincere,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not just afraid of being dragged away,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a real phenomenon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m really torn on Putin&rsquo;s approval rating,</p>
<p>real approval rating seems to be very high.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m torn in whether that has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that there is control of the press,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s, which is the people I talked to</p>
<p>who are in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love</p>
<p>of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done</p>
<p>and is going to do with Russia.</p>
<p>And a lot of that would go away</p>
<p>if the press were freer, I think.</p>
<p>Yes, well, Singapore realizes this,</p>
<p>anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,</p>
<p>people in Singapore have done a great job.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re discussed by the press, you don&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>Tech company executives are learning this, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a rule.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I think the rating is artificially high,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t by any means think it&rsquo;s all insincere,</p>
<p>but that high popularity I view as bearish for Russia.</p>
<p>I would feel better about the country</p>
<p>if people were more pissed off at him.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see free speech, even if it&rsquo;s full of hate.</p>
<p>I am also troubled on the scientific side</p>
<p>and entrepreneurial side, it seems difficult</p>
<p>to be an entrepreneur in Russia.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not even in terms of rules,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just culturally, the people I speak to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy to build a business, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not part of the culture,</p>
<p>part of the conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the conversation is,</p>
<p>if you wanna be the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk,</p>
<p>or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense they have.</p>
<p>Yeah, history matters.</p>
<p>Is it history, is it structural problems of today?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same thing.</p>
<p>So a history of hostility to commerce,</p>
<p>which of course the old USSR is gone,</p>
<p>but a lot of the attitudes remain,</p>
<p>a lot of the corruption remains.</p>
<p>You have this legacy distribution of wealth</p>
<p>from the auctioning off of the assets,</p>
<p>which is not conducive to some kind of broadly egalitarian</p>
<p>democracy, and so you have these small number</p>
<p>of power points that try to control information and wealth</p>
<p>and not really so keen to encourage the others</p>
<p>who ultimately would pull the balance of political power</p>
<p>away from the very wealthy and from Putin,</p>
<p>and they support that culture,</p>
<p>and the return of interest in Orthodox Church and all that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all part of the same piece, I think,</p>
<p>because the old Orthodox Church is not that pro commerce,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to say, but it&rsquo;s traditionalist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pro family, those are safer ideas,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s such a great safety valve,</p>
<p>the most ambitious, smartest people,</p>
<p>like they probably will learn English,</p>
<p>they sort of can look like they belong</p>
<p>in all sorts of other countries,</p>
<p>they can show up and blend in, super talented,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve probably had an excellent education,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re from one of the two major cities,</p>
<p>but even if not so, even from Siberia,</p>
<p>and they go off, they leave,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a source of opposition,</p>
<p>and that keeps the whole thing up and running</p>
<p>for another generation.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you make of the other big player, China?</p>
<p>They seem to have a very different messed up,</p>
<p>but also functioning system.</p>
<p>They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re choosing winners,</p>
<p>but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?</p>
<p>Why does it work as well as it does currently?</p>
<p>What are your concerns about it,</p>
<p>and what are its threats to the United States,</p>
<p>or possible, what is it you said,</p>
<p>wisdom isn&rsquo;t when two ideas come together,</p>
<p>is there some possible benefits</p>
<p>of these kinds of ideas coming together?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what China has done,</p>
<p>but I would say to put it in perspective,</p>
<p>if you compare them to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,</p>
<p>Hong Kong, and Singapore,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve still done much worse, not even close.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s both living standards,</p>
<p>or I hesitate to cite democracy</p>
<p>as an unalloyed good in and of itself,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more freedom in all those other places by a lot.</p>
<p>So China has all these problems of history,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve managed, as actually the Soviets did</p>
<p>in the middle of the 20th century,</p>
<p>one of the two great mass migrations</p>
<p>from the countryside to cities,</p>
<p>which boosts productivity enormously</p>
<p>and will sustain totalitarian systems,</p>
<p>but they moved from a totalitarian system to an oligarchy</p>
<p>where the CCP is actually, at least for a while,</p>
<p>hey, have been really good at governing,</p>
<p>have made a lot of very good decisions.</p>
<p>You have to admit that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long that streak will continue</p>
<p>with one person so much now holding authority</p>
<p>in a more extreme manner.</p>
<p>The selection pressures for the next generation</p>
<p>of high level CCP members probably become much worse.</p>
<p>You have this general problem of the state owned enterprise</p>
<p>is losing relative productivity</p>
<p>compared to the private sector.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re gonna kind of hold Jack Ma on this island</p>
<p>and he can only issue like weird hello statements.</p>
<p>It kind of smells bad to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s about to crash,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see them supplanting America</p>
<p>as like the world&rsquo;s number one country.</p>
<p>I think they will muddle through</p>
<p>and have very serious problems,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s enough talent there they will muddle through.</p>
<p>Is there ideas from China or from anywhere in general</p>
<p>of large scale role of government</p>
<p>that you find might be useful?</p>
<p>Like Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform,</p>
<p>UBI, right, Universal Basic Income.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting ideas of large scale</p>
<p>government sort of welfare programs at scale</p>
<p>that you find interesting?</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind the current version</p>
<p>of the Chinese Communist Party post now dismantled</p>
<p>what was called the iron rice ball.</p>
<p>So it took apart the healthcare protections,</p>
<p>a lot of the welfare system, a lot of the guaranteed jobs.</p>
<p>So the economic rise of China coincided</p>
<p>with the weakening of welfare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s causal per se,</p>
<p>but people think of China as having a government</p>
<p>that takes care of everyone, it&rsquo;s very far from the truth.</p>
<p>And by a lot of metrics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean control over people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean speech, but by a lot of metrics,</p>
<p>economically we have a lot more government than they do.</p>
<p>So what one means here by like government, private control,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can just add up the numbers</p>
<p>and get a simple answer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been fantastic at building infrastructure in cities</p>
<p>in ways that will attract people from the countryside.</p>
<p>And furthermore, they more or less enforce a meritocracy</p>
<p>in this sense.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a kid of a rich guy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get unfair privilege.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unfair, but systems can afford that.</p>
<p>If you are smart and from the countryside</p>
<p>and your parents have nothing,</p>
<p>you will be elevated and sent to a very good school,</p>
<p>graduate school because of the exam system.</p>
<p>And they do that and they mean that very consistently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Soviets had a version of that</p>
<p>like for chess and romantic piano.</p>
<p>Not for everything, but where they had it,</p>
<p>like again, they were tremendous, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And Chinese have it in so many areas,</p>
<p>a genuine meritocracy in this one way.</p>
<p>That moves people from the rural to the big city</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a big boost of productivity</p>
<p>for some amount of time.</p>
<p>And when they get there, they&rsquo;re taken seriously.</p>
<p>Jack Ma was riding a bicycle,</p>
<p>teaching English in his late 20s.</p>
<p>He was a poor guy.</p>
<p>Not a society of credentialism.</p>
<p>Or in America, it&rsquo;s way too much a credentialist society.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re talking about even with the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>But what do you think about these large government programs</p>
<p>like UBI?</p>
<p>The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me</p>
<p>is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids.</p>
<p>Like kids are vulnerable.</p>
<p>If their parents screw up, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame the kid</p>
<p>or make the kids suffer.</p>
<p>I believe in something like UBI for kids.</p>
<p>Maybe just cash.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t have kids, even with AI,</p>
<p>my sense is at least in the world we know,</p>
<p>you should be able to find a way to adjust.</p>
<p>You might have to move to North Dakota to work,</p>
<p>next to fracking, say.</p>
<p>But look, before the pandemic,</p>
<p>the two most robot intensive societies,</p>
<p>Japan and the US, US at least for manufacturing,</p>
<p>were at full employment.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s some far off day</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s literally no work, John Lennon,</p>
<p>and imagine it&rsquo;s piped everywhere.</p>
<p>And then we might revisit the question.</p>
<p>But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years</p>
<p>and full employment.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see the point.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see automation as a threat</p>
<p>that fundamentally shakes our society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a threat in the following sense.</p>
<p>The new technologies are harder to work with</p>
<p>for many people, and that&rsquo;s a social problem.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure a universal basic income</p>
<p>is the right answer to that very real problem.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s also, I like the UBI for kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also your definition or the line,</p>
<p>the threshold for what is vulnerable</p>
<p>and what is basic human nature.</p>
<p>Going back to Russia, life is suffering.</p>
<p>That struggle is a part of life.</p>
<p>And perhaps sort of changing,</p>
<p>maybe what defines the 21st century</p>
<p>is having multiple careers</p>
<p>and adjusting and learning and evolving.</p>
<p>And some of the technology in terms of,</p>
<p>some of the technology we see like the internet</p>
<p>allows us to make those pivots easier,</p>
<p>allows later life education possible.</p>
<p>It makes it possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And your earlier point about loneliness</p>
<p>being this fundamental human problem,</p>
<p>which I would agree with strongly,</p>
<p>UBI, if it&rsquo;s at a high level, will make that worse.</p>
<p>I mean, say UBI were higher enough,</p>
<p>you could just sit at home.</p>
<p>People are not gonna be happy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually want that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve relearned that in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah, the flip side, the hope with UBI</p>
<p>is you have a little bit more freedom</p>
<p>to find the thing that alleviates your loneliness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of an open question.</p>
<p>If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars,</p>
<p>will you pursue the thing you love?</p>
<p>Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love,</p>
<p>to do the thing you love,</p>
<p>or will you be lazy and lose yourself</p>
<p>in the sort of daily activities</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t actually bring you joy,</p>
<p>but pacify you in some kind of way</p>
<p>where you just let the days slip by?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the open question.</p>
<p>A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions,</p>
<p>whether it was Mozart or James Brown</p>
<p>or the great painters in history,</p>
<p>they had to work pretty hard.</p>
<p>And if you look at heirs to great fortunes,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m forgetting someone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to think of any</p>
<p>who have creatively been important as novelists,</p>
<p>or they might have continued to run the family business.</p>
<p>But Van Gogh was not heir to a great family fortune.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that cushions get in the way of progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same point about prizes, right?</p>
<p>Inheriting too much money is like winning a prize.</p>
<p>We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>I know you agree on a bunch of things.</p>
<p>Is there some beautiful, fascinating,</p>
<p>insightful disagreement that you have</p>
<p>that has yet to be resolved with him?</p>
<p>Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on?</p>
<p>Is it the stagnation question that you mentioned?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of them, but here&rsquo;s at least two others.</p>
<p>But I would stress Eric is always evolving.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just talking about a time slice Eric, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s at right now.</p>
<p>Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago,</p>
<p>but that was three nights ago.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s far too pessimistic</p>
<p>about the impact of immigration on U.S. science.</p>
<p>He thinks it has displaced U.S. scientists,</p>
<p>which I think that is partly true.</p>
<p>I just think we&rsquo;ve gotten better talent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, bring it on, double down.</p>
<p>And look at Kiriko, who basically came up</p>
<p>with mRNA vaccines, she was from Hungary.</p>
<p>And was ridiculed and mocked,</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t get her papers published.</p>
<p>She stuck at it.</p>
<p>An American might not have been so stubborn</p>
<p>because we have these cushions.</p>
<p>So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re discouraging native U.S. citizens from doing math.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, bring in the best people.</p>
<p>If we all end up in other avocations,</p>
<p>absolutely fine by me.</p>
<p>Does it trouble you that we kick them out</p>
<p>after they get a degree often?</p>
<p>I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree</p>
<p>a green card, universally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>It makes so strange that the best people that come here</p>
<p>suffer here, create awesome stuff here,</p>
<p>then when we kick them out, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another view I have.</p>
<p>I call it open borders for Belarus.</p>
<p>Now Russia&rsquo;s a big country.</p>
<p>I would gladly increase the Russian quota</p>
<p>by three X, four X, five X, not 20%, but a big boost.</p>
<p>But Belarus, a small country, and they&rsquo;re poor,</p>
<p>and they have decent education, and a lot of talent there.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just open the door</p>
<p>and convert a Belarus passport to a green card?</p>
<p>Open borders for Belarus, it&rsquo;s my new campaign slogan.</p>
<p>Are you running for president in 2024?</p>
<p>Well, write ins are welcome, but.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the second thing you disagree with, Eric?</p>
<p>Trade, again, I&rsquo;m not sure where he&rsquo;s at now,</p>
<p>but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.</p>
<p>I do understand what&rsquo;s called the China shock</p>
<p>has been a big problem for the US middle class.</p>
<p>I fully accept that.</p>
<p>I think most of that is behind us.</p>
<p>National security issues aside,</p>
<p>I think free trade is very much a good thing.</p>
<p>Eric, I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s not a good thing,</p>
<p>but he won&rsquo;t say it is a good thing.</p>
<p>And I know he&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s like, Eric, free trade.</p>
<p>But look, on things like vaccines,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in free trade.</p>
<p>You want vaccine production in your own country,</p>
<p>look at the EU.</p>
<p>They have enough money, no one will send them vaccines.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different about vaccines?</p>
<p>Is it, there&rsquo;s some things you want to prioritize</p>
<p>the citizenry on.</p>
<p>You could argue it would be cheaper</p>
<p>to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.</p>
<p>They have the technologies, obviously lower wages,</p>
<p>but look, there&rsquo;s talk in India right now</p>
<p>of cutting off the export of vaccines.</p>
<p>If you outsource your vaccine production,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sure the other country</p>
<p>will respect the norm of free trade.</p>
<p>So you need to keep some vaccine production in your country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exception to free trade, not to the logic,</p>
<p>a bunch of things the Navy uses.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t buy those components from China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me completely shift topics</p>
<p>on something that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same topic, but great.</p>
<p>Everything is interesting.</p>
<p>What do you think about what the hell is money?</p>
<p>And the recent excitement around cryptocurrency</p>
<p>that brings to the forefront</p>
<p>the philosophical discussion of the nature of money.</p>
<p>Are you bullish on cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Are you excited about it?</p>
<p>What does it make you think about</p>
<p>how the nature of money is changing?</p>
<p>No one knows what money is.</p>
<p>Probably no one ever knew.</p>
<p>Go back to medieval times, bills of exchange.</p>
<p>Were they money?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just a semantic debate.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, what about copper coins?</p>
<p>What about metals that were considered legal tender</p>
<p>but not always circulating?</p>
<p>What about credit?</p>
<p>So being confused about moneyness</p>
<p>is the natural state of affairs for human beings.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s more of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s probably a good thing.</p>
<p>Now, crypto per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over</p>
<p>a lot of the space held by gold.</p>
<p>That to me seems sustainable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not short Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have some view that the price</p>
<p>has to be different than the current price,</p>
<p>but I know it changes every moment.</p>
<p>I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto,</p>
<p>which seems connected to ultimate visions</p>
<p>of using it for transactions in ways where I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the retail demand really is there</p>
<p>once it is regulated like everything else is.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;m 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto.</p>
<p>That is, I think it&rsquo;s somewhat more likely</p>
<p>they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about it becoming</p>
<p>one of the main currencies in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t think will happen.</p>
<p>So, but the reality is that Bitcoin used to be</p>
<p>in the single digits of a dollar and now has crossed $50,000</p>
<p>for a single Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible it reaches</p>
<p>something like a million dollars?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If people decide it&rsquo;s worth a million dollars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that money?</p>
<p>Like you said, isn&rsquo;t the ultimate state of money confusion,</p>
<p>however beautifully you put it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like valuing an Andy Warhol painting.</p>
<p>So when Warhol started off,</p>
<p>probably those things had no value.</p>
<p>They were sketches, early sketches of shoes.</p>
<p>Now a good Warhol could be worth over 50 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible rate of price appreciation.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to know where it will stop,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about trying to figure out</p>
<p>what do people think of Andy Warhol?</p>
<p>He could be out of fashion in a century.</p>
<p>Maybe yes, maybe no.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think about Warhols as money.</p>
<p>They perform some money like functions.</p>
<p>You can even use them as collateral</p>
<p>for like deals between gangs.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not basically money, nor is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I would think is likely to fall, if anything.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be some kind of phase shift</p>
<p>where it become adopted and become mainstream</p>
<p>for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?</p>
<p>Bitcoin, no.</p>
<p>Now, you know, ether has some chance at that.</p>
<p>I would bet against it,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t give you a definitive no.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t put us here.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is too costly.</p>
<p>It may be fine to hold it like gold,</p>
<p>but gold is also costly.</p>
<p>You have smart people trying to make, say, ether,</p>
<p>much more effective as a currency than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly a decent chance they will succeed.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation.</p>
<p>I mean, with smart contracts, with NFTs as well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting innovations</p>
<p>that are plugging into the human psyche somehow,</p>
<p>just like money does.</p>
<p>You know, money seems to be this viral thing,</p>
<p>our ideas of money, right?</p>
<p>And if the idea is strong enough,</p>
<p>it seems to be able to take hold.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s network effects that just take over.</p>
<p>And like, I particularly see that with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your comment on Dogecoin,</p>
<p>which is basically by a single human being,</p>
<p>Elon Musk has been created.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like these celebrities</p>
<p>can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money.</p>
<p>Is it possible that in the 21st century,</p>
<p>people like Elon Musk and celebrities,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Donald Trump, The Rock,</p>
<p>whoever else, can actually define,</p>
<p>you know, the currencies that we use?</p>
<p>Maybe can Dogecoin become the primary currency of the world?</p>
<p>I think of it as like baseball cards.</p>
<p>So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card.</p>
<p>And the players who are stars,</p>
<p>their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s stable, we&rsquo;ve had it for many decades.</p>
<p>Sort of the player defines the card,</p>
<p>they sign a contract with Topps or whatever company.</p>
<p>Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players,</p>
<p>LeBron James, having their own currencies instead of cards?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and you&rsquo;re somewhat seeing that right now,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, artists with these unique works</p>
<p>on the blockchain.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure those are macroeconomically important.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just a new class of collectibles</p>
<p>that people have fun with, again, I say, bring it on.</p>
<p>But whether there are use cases beyond that,</p>
<p>that challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I sent money to a family in Ethiopia</p>
<p>that I helped support.</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours, they got that money.</p>
<p>Digitally, yes.</p>
<p>No, not digitally, through my bank.</p>
<p>My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&amp;T, Mid Atlantic Bank,</p>
<p>headquartered in North Carolina,</p>
<p>charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC.</p>
<p>Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate was not so great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see crypto as close to beating that</p>
<p>once you take into account all of the last mile problems.</p>
<p>Fiat currency works really well.</p>
<p>People are not sitting around bitching about it.</p>
<p>And when you talk to crypto people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crypto people, the number who have to postulate</p>
<p>some out of the blue hyperinflation,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no evidence for that whatsoever,</p>
<p>that to me is a sign they&rsquo;re not thinking clearly</p>
<p>about how hard they have to work</p>
<p>to outcompete fiat currency.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different technologies</p>
<p>that are really exciting that don&rsquo;t want to address</p>
<p>how difficult it is to outcompete</p>
<p>the current accepted alternative.</p>
<p>So for example, autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>A lot of people are really excited.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not trivial to outcompete Uber</p>
<p>on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience</p>
<p>and all those kinds of, sorry, Uber driven by humans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, you know, that&rsquo;s taken for granted,</p>
<p>I think, that look, wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing,</p>
<p>how amazing would the world look</p>
<p>when the cars are driving themselves fully,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s gonna drive the cost down,</p>
<p>you can remove the cost of drivers,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s when you actually get down to it</p>
<p>and have to build a business around it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually very difficult to do.</p>
<p>And I guess you&rsquo;re saying your sense</p>
<p>is similar competition is facing cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Like you have to actually present a killer app reason</p>
<p>to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or to whatever.</p>
<p>And the Biden people are gonna regulate crypto</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna do it soon.</p>
<p>So something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper</p>
<p>or for some can be cheaper than other ways</p>
<p>of conducting financial intermediation.</p>
<p>But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>It will not be allowed to go on forever</p>
<p>for better or worse.</p>
<p>I would rather see it given greater tolerance.</p>
<p>But the point is banking lobby is strong.</p>
<p>The government will only let it run so far.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be capital requirements,</p>
<p>reporting requirements imposed,</p>
<p>and it will lose a lot of those advantages.</p>
<p>What do you make of Wall Street bets?</p>
<p>Another thing that recently happened</p>
<p>that shook the world and at least me</p>
<p>from the outside of perspective,</p>
<p>make me question what I do</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t understand about our economics.</p>
<p>Which is a bunch of different,</p>
<p>a large number of individuals</p>
<p>getting together on the internet</p>
<p>and having a large scale impact on the markets.</p>
<p>If you tell a group of people</p>
<p>and coordinate them through the internet,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna play a fun game, it might cost you money,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna make the headlines</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ll screw over</p>
<p>some billionaires and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Enough people will play that game.</p>
<p>So that game might continue,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s of macroeconomic importance.</p>
<p>And the price of those stocks in the medium term</p>
<p>will end up wherever it ought to be.</p>
<p>So these are little outliers</p>
<p>from a macroeconomics perspective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>these are not signals of shifting power,</p>
<p>like from centralized power to distributed power.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t some fundamental changes in the way</p>
<p>our economy works.</p>
<p>I think of it as a new brand of eSports,</p>
<p>maybe more fun than the old brand.</p>
<p>Which is fine, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like push the anarchy into the corners</p>
<p>where you want it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bother me,</p>
<p>but I think people are seeing it</p>
<p>as more fun than it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new eSport, more fun for many,</p>
<p>but more expensive than the old eSports.</p>
<p>Like chess is a new eSport, super cheap,</p>
<p>not as fun as like sending hedge funds to their doom,</p>
<p>but like, what would you expect?</p>
<p>The poetry, I love it, okay.</p>
<p>But macroeconomically, it&rsquo;s not fundamental.</p>
<p>Okay, I was going to say, I hope you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the chaos</p>
<p>of the masses that&rsquo;s creates.</p>
<p>But I also think that chaos is somewhat real to be clear,</p>
<p>but it will matter through other channels,</p>
<p>not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing the real macro phenomenon.</p>
<p>When people see a real macro phenomenon,</p>
<p>they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative.</p>
<p>And this micro story, like it fits the narrative,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean its importance fits the narrative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would kind of dissect the mistake</p>
<p>I think people are making.</p>
<p>The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s weird now, the internet.</p>
<p>Either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s the right way to put it.</p>
<p>Maybe a mix of both.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right that it allows us to be weirder</p>
<p>because, well, this is the other, okay.</p>
<p>So this connects our previous conversation.</p>
<p>Does America allow us to be weirder</p>
<p>or does it make us weirder?</p>
<p>Like say we&rsquo;re weird and somewhat neurotic to begin with,</p>
<p>but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>
<p>and I Love Lucy and network TV.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s going to keep us within certain bounds.</p>
<p>In good and bad ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously totally gone.</p>
<p>And the internet, you can connect to not just QAnon,</p>
<p>but all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Many of them just fantastic, right?</p>
<p>But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.</p>
<p>So that maybe is troubling, right?</p>
<p>Like if someone&rsquo;s worried about that,</p>
<p>I would at least say they should</p>
<p>give it deep serious thought.</p>
<p>And then it has a whole lot of ebbs and flows,</p>
<p>micro realizations of the weirdness</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t actually matter.</p>
<p>So like chess players today,</p>
<p>they play a lot more weird openings</p>
<p>than they did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Like it reflects the same thing</p>
<p>because you can research any weird opening on the internet,</p>
<p>but like, does that matter?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>So a lot of the things we see</p>
<p>are just like the weird chess openings.</p>
<p>And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings</p>
<p>and which are fundamental to the new and growing weirdness,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what a hedge fund investor type</p>
<p>should be trying to do.</p>
<p>I just think no one knows yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this itself, this fun weird guessing game,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re partly engaging in right now.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I mean, as Eric talks about</p>
<p>on the science side of things,</p>
<p>I mean, I said like at MIT,</p>
<p>especially in the machine learning field,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a natural institutional resistance to the weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, as they talk about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to hire weird faculty, for example.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You want to hire and give tenure to people that are safe</p>
<p>and not weird.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the concerns is like,</p>
<p>it seems like the weird people</p>
<p>are the ones that push the science forward usually.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so like, how do you balance the two?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s another area where Eric and I disagree.</p>
<p>As I interpret him,</p>
<p>he thinks academia is totally bankrupt.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s only partially bankrupt.</p>
<p>How do we fix it?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m with you, I&rsquo;m bullish on academia.</p>
<p>You need up and coming schools</p>
<p>that end up better than where they started off.</p>
<p>And MIT was once one of them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re not in every area.</p>
<p>In some areas, they have become the problem.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>UChicago, you wouldn&rsquo;t call it up and coming,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still different.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope they manage to keep it that way.</p>
<p>The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism.</p>
<p>I kind of second tier schools,</p>
<p>maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen,</p>
<p>that are just trying to be like a junior MIT,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mediocre and copycat.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the most dogmatic enforcers of weirdness</p>
<p>that like Harvard is more open</p>
<p>than those second tier schools.</p>
<p>And those second tier schools</p>
<p>are pretty good typically, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the mediocrity is enforced there.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Very strictly.</p>
<p>And the homogenization pressures.</p>
<p>Climb the rankings by another three places</p>
<p>and be a little closer to MIT,</p>
<p>though you&rsquo;ll never touch them.</p>
<p>That to me is very harmful.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d rather they be more like Chicago,</p>
<p>more like Caltech, or the older Caltech all the more,</p>
<p>like pick some model, be weird in it.</p>
<p>You might fail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s socially better.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so the problem with MIT, for example,</p>
<p>is the mediocrity is really enforced on the junior faculty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like the people that are allowed to be weird,</p>
<p>or actually they just don&rsquo;t even ask for permissions anymore</p>
<p>are more senior faculty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good, of course,</p>
<p>but you want the weird young people.</p>
<p>I find too, this podcast, I like talking to tech people,</p>
<p>and I find the young faculty to be really boring.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most boring of faculty.</p>
<p>Their work is interesting technically,</p>
<p>technically, but just the passion.</p>
<p>They are drudges.</p>
<p>And some of them sneak by.</p>
<p>Like you have like the Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>young version of Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>who knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in.</p>
<p>And then on the side, he does the weird shit.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re far and few in between,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;d love to figure out a way to shake up that system</p>
<p>because as you look at MIT&rsquo;s Broad Institute, right,</p>
<p>in biomedical, it&rsquo;s been a huge hit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not privy to their internal doings,</p>
<p>but I suspect they support weird</p>
<p>more than the formal departments do at the junior level.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what, whatever they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working, but we needed to figure it out</p>
<p>because I think the best ideas still do come from the,</p>
<p>so forget, my apologies,</p>
<p>but for the humanities side of things,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about,</p>
<p>but the engineering and the science side,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so many amazing ideas</p>
<p>that are still coming from universities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true that you don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about the humanities.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the humanities right now.</p>
<p>Talking about people,</p>
<p>there are no numbers put on a blackboard, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hypothesis testing per se.</p>
<p>No, yeah.</p>
<p>You have however many subscribers to your podcast,</p>
<p>all listening to you on the humanities.</p>
<p>Every, whatever your frequency is.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not in the department of the humanities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s innovative.</p>
<p>They have very different conversations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the number of emails I get about,</p>
<p>listen, I really deeply respect diversity</p>
<p>and the full scope of what diversity means</p>
<p>and also the more narrow scope of different races</p>
<p>and genders and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important topic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a disproportionate number of emails</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting about meetings and discussions</p>
<p>and that just kind of is overwhelming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get enough emails from people,</p>
<p>like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, for example, let me call out MIT.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we do more?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we kick Stanford&rsquo;s ass or Google&rsquo;s ass,</p>
<p>more importantly, in deep learning and machine learning</p>
<p>and AI research?</p>
<p>What CSAIL, for example, used to be a laboratory</p>
<p>is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research.</p>
<p>And why is that not the beacon of greatness</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have those meetings as well.</p>
<p>Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism</p>
<p>for enforcing conformity.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And right, so it&rsquo;s almost like this conformity mechanism</p>
<p>finds the hot new topic to use</p>
<p>to enforce further conformity.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh boy, I still, I remain optimistic.</p>
<p>The humanities have innovated through podcasts,</p>
<p>including yours and mine, and they&rsquo;re alive and well.</p>
<p>All the bad talk you hear about the humanities</p>
<p>in universities, there&rsquo;s been this huge end run</p>
<p>of innovation on the internet and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I never thought of, I mean, this is humanities.</p>
<p>This podcast is right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve been speaking prose all one&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t know it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department</p>
<p>at MIT now.</p>
<p>I did not realize this and I will fully embrace it</p>
<p>from this moment on.</p>
<p>Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know about it.</p>
<p>Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re out competing them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blowing them out of the water.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you are them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and I&rsquo;m talking to those folks</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just trying to, well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on,</p>
<p>but outside of that, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually gone through a shift</p>
<p>with this particular podcast, for example,</p>
<p>where at first it was seen as a,</p>
<p>one, at the very first it was seen as a distraction.</p>
<p>Second, it was a source of like,</p>
<p>almost like a kind of jealousy,</p>
<p>like the same kind of jealousy you feel</p>
<p>when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s more like, oh, okay, this is a thing.</p>
<p>Like we should do more of that.</p>
<p>We should embrace this guy.</p>
<p>We should embrace this thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense that podcasting and whatever this is,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be podcasting,</p>
<p>will drive some innovation within MIT,</p>
<p>within different universities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense that things are changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that universities lag behind.</p>
<p>And my hope is that they catch up quickly.</p>
<p>They innovate in some way that goes along</p>
<p>with the innovations of the internet.</p>
<p>Online.</p>
<p>I think the internet will outrace them</p>
<p>for a long time, maybe forever.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, but it&rsquo;s okay if they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re keeping.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;re both in universities.</p>
<p>So we have multiple hats on here as we&rsquo;re speaking.</p>
<p>So we can complain about the universities,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like complaining about the podcast, right?</p>
<p>We be them.</p>
<p>But speaking on the weird,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve in the best sense of the word weird,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written about and made the case</p>
<p>that we should take UFO sightings more seriously.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the things that I&rsquo;ve been inundated with,</p>
<p>sort of the excitement and the passion that people have</p>
<p>for the possibility of extraterrestrial life,</p>
<p>of life out there in the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt this excitement.</p>
<p>I was just looking up at the stars</p>
<p>and wondering what the hell&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s people that have more like,</p>
<p>more grounded excitement and passion</p>
<p>of actually interacting with aliens</p>
<p>on this here, our planet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the case from your perspective</p>
<p>for taking these sightings more seriously?</p>
<p>The data from the Navy, to me, seem quite serious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend that I have the technical abilities</p>
<p>to judge it as data,</p>
<p>but there are numerous senators</p>
<p>at the very highest of levels,</p>
<p>former heads of CIA, Brennan.</p>
<p>I talked to him, did an interview with him.</p>
<p>I asked him, what&rsquo;s up with these?</p>
<p>What do you think it is?</p>
<p>He basically said that was the single most likely explanation</p>
<p>was of alien origin.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t have to agree with him.</p>
<p>But look, if you know how government works, these senators,</p>
<p>or Hillary Clinton, for that matter, or Brennan,</p>
<p>they sat down, they were briefed by their smartest people,</p>
<p>and they said, hey, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>And everyone around the table, I believe,</p>
<p>is telling them, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that is sociological data I take very seriously.</p>
<p>I have not seen a debunking of the technical data,</p>
<p>which is eyewitness reports and images and radar.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t pretend that I have the technical abilities</p>
<p>or again, at a technical level,</p>
<p>I feel quite uncertain on that turf.</p>
<p>But evaluating through the testimony of witnesses,</p>
<p>it seems to me it&rsquo;s now at a threshold</p>
<p>where one ought to take it seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the problems with UFO sightings</p>
<p>is that because of people with good equipment</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take it seriously, it&rsquo;s such a taboo topic,</p>
<p>that you have just like really shitty equipment</p>
<p>collecting data.</p>
<p>And so you have the blurry Bigfoot kind of situation</p>
<p>where you have just bad video and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>As opposed to, I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people,</p>
<p>Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Oumuamua.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like people with the equipment</p>
<p>to do the data collection don&rsquo;t want to help out.</p>
<p>And that creates a kind of divide</p>
<p>where the scientists ignore that this is happening</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the masses of people who are curious about it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the government that&rsquo;s full of secrets</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s leaking some confusion</p>
<p>and it creates distrust in the government,</p>
<p>it creates distrust in science</p>
<p>and it prevents the scientists</p>
<p>from being able to explore some cool topics,</p>
<p>some exciting possibilities that they should be,</p>
<p>be curious kids like Avi talks about.</p>
<p>Even if it has nothing to do with aliens,</p>
<p>whatever the answer is, it has to be something fascinating.</p>
<p>We already know everything&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>but this is fascinating.</p>
<p>But look, that all said,</p>
<p>I suspect they&rsquo;re not of alien origin.</p>
<p>And let me tell you my reason.</p>
<p>The people who are all gung ho,</p>
<p>they do a kind of reasoning in reverse</p>
<p>or argument from elimination.</p>
<p>They figure out a bunch of things that can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>like is it a Russian advanced vehicle?</p>
<p>No, probably pretty good arguments there.</p>
<p>Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it people like from the earth&rsquo;s future</p>
<p>coming back in time?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And they go through a few others.</p>
<p>They have some really good no arguments.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re like, well, what we&rsquo;ve got left is aliens.</p>
<p>This argument from elimination,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually find that persuasive.</p>
<p>You can talk yourself into a lot of mistaken ideas that way.</p>
<p>The positive evidence that it&rsquo;s aliens is still quite weak.</p>
<p>The positive evidence that it&rsquo;s a puzzle is quite huge.</p>
<p>And whatever the solution to the puzzle is,</p>
<p>it might be fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be so weird or fascinating</p>
<p>or maybe even trivial, but that&rsquo;s weird in its own way,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t set up by elimination</p>
<p>all the things that might be able to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just like you said,</p>
<p>the debunking that I&rsquo;ve seen of these kinds of things</p>
<p>are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle</p>
<p>and more a kind of halfhearted dismissal.</p>
<p>And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been attacked an awful lot.</p>
<p>And when I hear the idea carrier attacked,</p>
<p>I get very suspicious of the critics.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s wrong, like just tell me why.</p>
<p>Like my ears are open.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a set view on Oumuamua, you know.</p>
<p>I know I can&rsquo;t judge Avi&rsquo;s arguments.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t convince me in that sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too stupid to understand</p>
<p>how good his argument may or may not be.</p>
<p>And like you said, ultimately,</p>
<p>in the argument, in the meeting of that debate</p>
<p>is where we find the wisdom.</p>
<p>Like dismissing it, there&rsquo;s one other thing</p>
<p>that troubles me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people,</p>
<p>like Nietzsche sometimes dismiss this way.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand is sometimes dismissed this way.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a, as opposed to arguing against her ideas,</p>
<p>dismissing it outright.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not productive at all.</p>
<p>She may be wrong on a lot of things,</p>
<p>but like laying out some arguments,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re basic human arguments,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we arrive at the wisdom.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Is there something deeper to be said</p>
<p>about our trust in institutions and governments and so on</p>
<p>that has to do with UFOs?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a kind of suspicion</p>
<p>that the US government and governments in general</p>
<p>are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.</p>
<p>This is my view on that.</p>
<p>If we declassified everything,</p>
<p>I think we would find a lot more evidence</p>
<p>all pointing toward the same puzzle.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t some alien men being held underground.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not some secret file that lays out</p>
<p>whatever is happening.</p>
<p>I think the real lesson about government</p>
<p>is government cannot bring itself to any new belief</p>
<p>on this matter of any kind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a kind of funny inertia.</p>
<p>Like government is deeply puzzled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more puzzled than they want to admit to us,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m okay with that, actually.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t just be out panicking people in the streets.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine,</p>
<p>which does work and they haven&rsquo;t approved it.</p>
<p>When are they gonna do it?</p>
<p>When is our government actually, if only internally,</p>
<p>gonna take this more than just seriously,</p>
<p>but take it truly seriously?</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t know if we have that capability,</p>
<p>kind of mentally, to sound like Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>for another moment.</p>
<p>And to stay on the same topic,</p>
<p>although on the surface shifting completely,</p>
<p>because it is all the same topic.</p>
<p>You have written and studied art.</p>
<p>Why do you think we humans long to create art,</p>
<p>human society in general and just the human mind?</p>
<p>Well, most of us don&rsquo;t really long to create art, right?</p>
<p>I would start with that point.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s a unique weirdness</p>
<p>of some particular humans?</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know, 10% of humans roughly,</p>
<p>which is a lot, but it is somewhat weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t aspire to create art.</p>
<p>You could say, like writing nonfiction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something art like about it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different urge, I would say.</p>
<p>So why do some people have it?</p>
<p>I think human brains are very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different notion of working through a problem.</p>
<p>Like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.</p>
<p>For me, economics, for you, AI and other areas,</p>
<p>or your humanities podcast, but that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>For that problem to be visual</p>
<p>and linked to physical materials</p>
<p>and putting those like on a canvas,</p>
<p>to me, it&rsquo;s not a huge leap,</p>
<p>but I really don&rsquo;t wanna do it.</p>
<p>Like it would be pain.</p>
<p>If you paid me like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, is that worth it?</p>
<p>Maybe, but like, I&rsquo;m happy when that hour&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And would not be proud or happy with the result.</p>
<p>It would suck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would do it actually.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re suppressing some deep, I mean?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Now, when I was young, I played the guitar</p>
<p>as you played the guitar and that I greatly enjoyed,</p>
<p>although I was never good,</p>
<p>but it helped me appreciate music much, much more.</p>
<p>Well, this is the question.</p>
<p>Okay, so from the perspective of the observer</p>
<p>and appreciator of art, you said good.</p>
<p>Is there such a concept as good in art?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly a concept of bad.</p>
<p>My guitar playing fit that concept.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t trying to be good.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn like how do chords work?</p>
<p>Okay, analytical.</p>
<p>How does a jazz improvisation work?</p>
<p>How is blues different?</p>
<p>Classical guitar, sort of physically,</p>
<p>how do you make those sounds?</p>
<p>And I did learn those things.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t learn everything about them,</p>
<p>but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good</p>
<p>or even trying to be that good.</p>
<p>But I could play all the notes.</p>
<p>So from the observer perspective,</p>
<p>what do you, I apologize for the absurd question,</p>
<p>but what do you use the most beautiful</p>
<p>and maybe moving piece of art you&rsquo;ve encountered</p>
<p>in your life?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an absurd question at all.</p>
<p>And I think about this quite a bit.</p>
<p>I would say the two winners by a clear margin</p>
<p>are both by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Pieta in the Vatican</p>
<p>and the David statue in Florence.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can view it apart from historical context</p>
<p>and being in Florence or in the Vatican,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already primed for a lot, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pull that out.</p>
<p>But just technically how they express</p>
<p>the emotion of human form,</p>
<p>I do honestly intellectually think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the two greatest artworks for doing that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not all that art does.</p>
<p>Not all art is about the human form,</p>
<p>but they are phenomenal.</p>
<p>And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,</p>
<p>but my view is not considered a crazy one</p>
<p>within the broader court of critical opinion.</p>
<p>Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away</p>
<p>was to see Vermeer&rsquo;s artwork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Art of Painting and it&rsquo;s in Vienna</p>
<p>in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.</p>
<p>And I saw that, I think I was 23.</p>
<p>It just stunned me because I&rsquo;d seen reproductions,</p>
<p>but live in front of you in huge,</p>
<p>a completely different artwork.</p>
<p>And again, Vienna, primed.</p>
<p>Yes, and I was living abroad for the first time</p>
<p>and Vienna itself, the city and so on.</p>
<p>Now, unlike the Michelangelo&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that is not my current favorite painting,</p>
<p>but that would be like historically the one I would pick.</p>
<p>What do you make in the context of those choices?</p>
<p>What do you make of modern art?</p>
<p>And I apologize if I&rsquo;m not using the correct terminology,</p>
<p>but art that maybe goes another level of weird</p>
<p>outside of the art that you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned</p>
<p>and breaks all the conventions and rules and so on</p>
<p>and becomes something else entirely</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make sense in the same way</p>
<p>that David might.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is phenomenal.</p>
<p>And I would say the single biggest mistake</p>
<p>that really smart people make is to think contemporary art</p>
<p>or music for that matter is just a load of junk or rubbish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a kind of mathematics</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t learned yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to learn.</p>
<p>Maybe some people can never learn it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very large community of super smart,</p>
<p>well educated people who spend their lives with it,</p>
<p>who love it.</p>
<p>Those are genuine pleasures.</p>
<p>They understand it.</p>
<p>They talk about it with the common language.</p>
<p>And to think that somehow they&rsquo;re all frauds,</p>
<p>it just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Like one doesn&rsquo;t have to like it oneself,</p>
<p>just like Love House may or may not be your thing,</p>
<p>but it is amazing and for me personally, highly rewarding.</p>
<p>And if someone doesn&rsquo;t get it,</p>
<p>I do kind of have the conceited response of thinking</p>
<p>like in that area, I&rsquo;m just smarter than you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the interesting thing is as with most&hellip;</p>
<p>We get back to Eric Weinstein again.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in general smarter than I am, this I get.</p>
<p>But when it comes to contemporary artistic creations,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smarter than he is.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not a fan of contemporary art?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to speak for him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard him say derogatory&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s evolving always.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard him say derogatory things about some of it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean he doesn&rsquo;t love some other parts of it.</p>
<p>So I wonder if there&rsquo;s just a higher learning curve,</p>
<p>a steeper learning curve for contemporary art,</p>
<p>meaning like it takes more work to appreciate the stories,</p>
<p>the context from which they&rsquo;re like thinking about this work.</p>
<p>It feels like in order to appreciate the art contemporary,</p>
<p>certain pieces of contemporary art,</p>
<p>you have to know the story better behind the art.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true for many people,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a funny shape distribution</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a whole other set of people.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re small children</p>
<p>and they get abstract art more easily.</p>
<p>You show them Vermeer or Rembrandt, they don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>But just like a wall of color, they&rsquo;re in love with it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I know the full story.</p>
<p>Again, some strange kind of distribution.</p>
<p>The entry barriers are super high or super low,</p>
<p>but not that often in between.</p>
<p>But you would challenge saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot to be explored in contemporary art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you need to learn.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the most profound bodies</p>
<p>of human thought out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of the humanities.</p>
<p>And yes, there are people who also don&rsquo;t like podcasts,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also been a scholar of food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going through the entirety</p>
<p>of the human experience today on this humanities podcast.</p>
<p>Another absurd question, say this conversation</p>
<p>is the last thing you ever do in your life.</p>
<p>I, wearing the suit, would murder you</p>
<p>at the end of the conversation.</p>
<p>So this is your last day on earth,</p>
<p>but I would offer you a last meal.</p>
<p>What would that meal contain?</p>
<p>We can also travel to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Well, we have to travel</p>
<p>because my preferred last meal here,</p>
<p>I probably had like two nights ago.</p>
<p>Which is what?</p>
<p>Can you describe or no?</p>
<p>The best restaurant around here is called Mama Chang&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in Fairfax and it&rsquo;s food from Wuhan actually.</p>
<p>And they take pandemic safety seriously</p>
<p>in addition to the food being very good.</p>
<p>But this is what I would do.</p>
<p>I would fly to Hermosillo in Northern Mexico,</p>
<p>which has some of the best food in Mexico,</p>
<p>but I sadly only had two days there.</p>
<p>So somewhere like Oaxaca, Puebla,</p>
<p>I think they have food just as good</p>
<p>or some people would say better,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in those places.</p>
<p>So the scarce, wait, is it possible the scarcity of time</p>
<p>contributed to the richness of the experience?</p>
<p>Of course, but the point is that scarcity still holds.</p>
<p>So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo.</p>
<p>Can you describe what the food is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally</p>
<p>is just like the Mexican food you get in the US.</p>
<p>So there are burritos, there&rsquo;s fajitas.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t taste at all like our stuff.</p>
<p>But again, nominally, it&rsquo;s the part of Mexican food</p>
<p>that made it into the US was then transformed.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in a way the most familiar.</p>
<p>But for that reason, it&rsquo;s the most radical</p>
<p>because you have to rethink all these things you know</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re way better in Hermosillo.</p>
<p>Hardly any tourists go there.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s nothing to see in Hermosillo.</p>
<p>Nothing you do other than eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ruined by any outsiders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap.</p>
<p>And the thing to do there is just sweet talk a taxi driver</p>
<p>into first taking you seriously</p>
<p>and then trusting you enough to know that you trust him</p>
<p>to bring you to the very best like food stands.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s the magic of that nominally similar</p>
<p>entity of the burrito?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the magic come from?</p>
<p>Is it the taxi ride?</p>
<p>Is it the whole experience</p>
<p>or is there something actually in the food?</p>
<p>So well, you can break the food down part by part.</p>
<p>So if you think of the beef,</p>
<p>the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air</p>
<p>in a way the FDA here would never permit.</p>
<p>Like they dry age it till it turns green,</p>
<p>but it is phenomenal.</p>
<p>The quality of the chilies.</p>
<p>So here there&rsquo;s only a small number</p>
<p>of kinds of chilies you can get.</p>
<p>In most parts of Mexico,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s quite a large number of chilies you can get.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different, they&rsquo;re fresher,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like a different thing.</p>
<p>The chilies, the wheat used.</p>
<p>So this is wheat territory, not corn territory,</p>
<p>which is a self interesting.</p>
<p>The wheat is more diverse and more complex.</p>
<p>Here it&rsquo;s more homogenized, obviously cheaper,</p>
<p>more efficient, but there it is better.</p>
<p>Non pasteurized cheeses are legal in all parts of Mexico</p>
<p>and they can be white and gooey and amazing</p>
<p>in a way that here again, it&rsquo;s just against the law.</p>
<p>You could legalize them.</p>
<p>The demand wouldn&rsquo;t be that great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a black market in these cheeses</p>
<p>that Latino groceries around here,</p>
<p>but you just can&rsquo;t get that much of it.</p>
<p>So the cheese, the meat, the wheat,</p>
<p>all different in significant ways.</p>
<p>The chilies, I don&rsquo;t think the onions really matter much.</p>
<p>Garlic, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put much stock in that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a lot of the core food</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s cooked much better</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s super fresh.</p>
<p>The food chain is not relying on refrigeration.</p>
<p>And this is one thing Russia and US have in common.</p>
<p>We were early pioneers in food refrigeration</p>
<p>and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early.</p>
<p>And it took us a long time to dig out of that</p>
<p>because big countries, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had an extensive rail system in Russia,</p>
<p>USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze</p>
<p>and then ship.</p>
<p>What about the actual cooking, the chef?</p>
<p>Is there an artistry to the simple?</p>
<p>I hesitate to call the burrito simple, but.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no brain drain out of cooking.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the United States and you&rsquo;re very talented,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t talented chefs.</p>
<p>Of course there are,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many other things to pull people away.</p>
<p>But in Mexico, there&rsquo;s so much talent going into food</p>
<p>as there is in China,</p>
<p>which would be another candidate for last meal questions.</p>
<p>Or India.</p>
<p>Or, oh, India, let&rsquo;s not even get started on India.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also, I mean, there&rsquo;s a million things</p>
<p>we could talk about here,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve written about your own dreams of sushi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a really clean, good example</p>
<p>that people are aware of of mastery</p>
<p>in the art of the simple in food.</p>
<p>What do you make of that kind of obsessive pursuit</p>
<p>of perfection in creating simple food?</p>
<p>Sushi is about perfection,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a bit like the Beatles White album,</p>
<p>which people think is simple and not overproduced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a funny way their most overproduced album,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s produced just perfectly.</p>
<p>It sounds simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to produce music to the point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna sound so simple and not sound like sludge.</p>
<p>Like Let It Be album, it has some great songs,</p>
<p>but a lot of it sounds like sludge.</p>
<p>One After 909, that&rsquo;s sludge.</p>
<p>I Dig A Pony, it&rsquo;s sludge.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a bit interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that good.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound that good.</p>
<p>White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence,</p>
<p>sounds perfect, sounds simple.</p>
<p>Cry Baby Cry, it&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>Back in the USSR, super complex.</p>
<p>So sushi is like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so incredibly not simple</p>
<p>starting with the rice.</p>
<p>You try to refine it to make it appear super simple,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the most complex thing of all.</p>
<p>So do you admire,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not talking about days, weeks, months.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about years, generations</p>
<p>of doing the same thing over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Do you admire that kind of sticking to the,</p>
<p>we talked about our admiration of the weird.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t feel weird.</p>
<p>That seems like discipline and dedication</p>
<p>to like a stoic minimalism or something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy they do it, but I actually feel bad about it.</p>
<p>I feel they&rsquo;re sacrificial victims to me,</p>
<p>which I benefit from.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you ever think like,</p>
<p>gee, you&rsquo;re a great master sushi chef.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you be happier if you did something else?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen.</p>
<p>That might be something that a weird mind would think.</p>
<p>Maybe it is weird people,</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re really enjoying it,</p>
<p>but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years</p>
<p>before they let you do anything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these Indian, you know, sarod players.</p>
<p>They just spent five years tapping out rhythms</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;re allowed to touch their instruments.</p>
<p>Well, actually to defend that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like graduate school, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think graduate school, perhaps.</p>
<p>Graduate school is full of,</p>
<p>like every single day is full of surprises, I would say.</p>
<p>I did martial arts for a long time.</p>
<p>I do martial arts, and I&rsquo;ve always loved,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of the Russian way of drilling,</p>
<p>is doing the same technique.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this applies</p>
<p>into intellectual or academic disciplines,</p>
<p>where you can do the same thing over and over and over again,</p>
<p>thousands and thousands and thousands of times.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve discovered through that process</p>
<p>is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details</p>
<p>and find the beauty in them.</p>
<p>People who go to like monasteries to meditate</p>
<p>talk about this, is when you just sit in silence</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty</p>
<p>there is in just the movement of a finger.</p>
<p>Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about</p>
<p>how fun it is to move a finger.</p>
<p>And then you can almost become your full weird self</p>
<p>about the tiniest details of life.</p>
<p>As a thing, you&rsquo;ve got to wonder,</p>
<p>like, is there a free lunch in there?</p>
<p>Are the rest of us moving around too much?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>They sure feel like they found a free lunch.</p>
<p>The people meditate, they&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>I tend to think it&rsquo;s like artists,</p>
<p>that some percent of people are like that,</p>
<p>but most are not.</p>
<p>And for most of us, there&rsquo;s no free lunch.</p>
<p>Like my free lunch is to move around a lot.</p>
<p>In search of lunch, in fact.</p>
<p>Well, with all the food talk, you made me hungry.</p>
<p>What books, three or so books,</p>
<p>if any come to mind, technical fiction, philosophical,</p>
<p>would you recommend, had a big impact on you,</p>
<p>or you just drew some insights from throughout your life?</p>
<p>Well, two of them we&rsquo;ve already discussed.</p>
<p>One is Plato&rsquo;s Dialogues,</p>
<p>which I started reading when I was like 13.</p>
<p>Another is Ayn Rand, Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal.</p>
<p>But I would say the Friedrich Hayek essay,</p>
<p>The Use of Knowledge in Society,</p>
<p>which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,</p>
<p>also why they might go wrong.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you start to understand</p>
<p>the price system, capitalism.</p>
<p>And that was in a book called</p>
<p>Individualism and Economic Order,</p>
<p>but it was just a few essays in that book.</p>
<p>Those are maybe the three I would cite.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate a little bit on the&hellip;</p>
<p>Say the price of copper goes up, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a problem with the copper mine</p>
<p>in Chile or Bolivia.</p>
<p>So the price of copper goes up.</p>
<p>All around the world, people are led to economize copper,</p>
<p>to look for substitutes for copper,</p>
<p>to change their production processes,</p>
<p>to change the goods and services they buy,</p>
<p>to build homes a different way.</p>
<p>And this one event creates</p>
<p>this one tiny change in information.</p>
<p>This gets into your AI work very directly.</p>
<p>And how much complexity that one change engenders</p>
<p>in a meaningful, coherent way,</p>
<p>how the different pieces of the price system fit together.</p>
<p>Hayek really laid out very clearly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like an AI problem.</p>
<p>And how well, not for everything,</p>
<p>but for many things, we solve that AI problem.</p>
<p>I learned, I was, I think 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.</p>
<p>Yeah, the distributed nature of things there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like your work on human attention,</p>
<p>like how much can we take in?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Very often not that much.</p>
<p>And how many of the advances of modern civilization</p>
<p>you need to understand as a response to that constraint.</p>
<p>I got that also from Hayek.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the title of the book again?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reprinted in a lot of books at this point.</p>
<p>But back then the book was called</p>
<p>Individualism and Economic Order.</p>
<p>But the essay is online.</p>
<p>Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.</p>
<p>There are open access versions of it through Google.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need the whole book.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very good book.</p>
<p>Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean,</p>
<p>maybe sitting on a porch,</p>
<p>maybe with a drink of some kind.</p>
<p>And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to?</p>
<p>A drink.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>So, okay, after that,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>as they take on life?</p>
<p>Whether a career in academia in general or just a life,</p>
<p>which is probably more important than career.</p>
<p>Most good advice is context specific.</p>
<p>But here are my two generic pieces of advice.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>First, get a mentor.</p>
<p>Both career, but anything you wanna learn.</p>
<p>Like say you wanna learn about contemporary art.</p>
<p>People write me this.</p>
<p>Oh, what book should I read?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not gonna work that way.</p>
<p>You need a mentor.</p>
<p>Yes, you should read some books on it.</p>
<p>But you want a mentor to help you frame them,</p>
<p>take you around to some art, talk about it with you.</p>
<p>So get as many mentors as you can</p>
<p>in the things you wanna learn.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I ask you a quick tangent on that?</p>
<p>Presumably a good mentor.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Is there&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m begging the question in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated, right?</p>
<p>Well, it is complicated.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very easy to drop mentors.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s quite hard to maintain them.</p>
<p>Good mentors tend to be busy.</p>
<p>Bad mentors tend to be busy.</p>
<p>And you can try on mentors</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re not good for you,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll learn something.</p>
<p>Like I had a mentor, I was an undergrad.</p>
<p>He was a Stalinist.</p>
<p>He edited the book called The Essential Stalin.</p>
<p>Brilliant guy.</p>
<p>I learned a tremendous amount from him.</p>
<p>Was he like as a Stalinist a good mentor for me?</p>
<p>Fan of Hayek?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>But for a year it was tremendous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He introduced me like to Soviet</p>
<p>and Eastern European science fiction</p>
<p>because he was a Marxist.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what I took from him among other things.</p>
<p>Any advice on finding a good mentor?</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman has&hellip;</p>
<p>Somebody just popped this to mind</p>
<p>as somebody who was able to find</p>
<p>exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many bright minds that find collaborators.</p>
<p>They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Be interesting, be direct and try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a perfect formula,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing how many people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even do those things.</p>
<p>Be interesting, be direct and try.</p>
<p>Like what you want from a better known person,</p>
<p>I would just say be very direct with them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the second piece of advice?</p>
<p>Build small groups of peers.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be your age,</p>
<p>but very often they&rsquo;ll be your age,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re younger</p>
<p>with broadly similar interests,</p>
<p>but there can be different points of view.</p>
<p>People you hang out with,</p>
<p>which can include in a WhatsApp group online</p>
<p>and like every day or almost every day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about the thing you care about,</p>
<p>trying to solve problems in that thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s your small group and you really like them</p>
<p>and they like you and you care</p>
<p>what you think about each other</p>
<p>and you have this common interest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for human connection</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s for development of ideas?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both, they&rsquo;re not that different.</p>
<p>Like Beatles, classic small group, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much drama.</p>
<p>The Florentine artists, of course there&rsquo;s drama</p>
<p>and small groups tend to split up, which is fine,</p>
<p>just like entering relationships off an end.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s remarkable how little has been done</p>
<p>that was not done in small groups in some way.</p>
<p>So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships,</p>
<p>where do you make this whole love thing?</p>
<p>Why do humans fall in love?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love, friendship, family in life?</p>
<p>In a successful life or just life in general?</p>
<p>Why the hell are we so into this thing?</p>
<p>There are multiple layers of understanding that question.</p>
<p>So kind of the lowest layer is the Darwinian answer, right?</p>
<p>If we weren&rsquo;t this way,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have been successful</p>
<p>in reproducing and building alliances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to realize that&rsquo;s far from complete.</p>
<p>Sort of the highest understanding would be poetic,</p>
<p>like read John Keats or many other love poets.</p>
<p>So who do I go to to find out,</p>
<p>to learn about love in terms of poets or?</p>
<p>I would say start with John Keats.</p>
<p>But given that you&rsquo;re fluent in Russian.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go Russian literature for a second.</p>
<p>Like you keep mentioning Russia.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your connection?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your love in Russia?</p>
<p>Well, first it&rsquo;s all interesting,</p>
<p>but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.</p>
<p>So Kolniki was her neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And she grew up there.</p>
<p>I married her here.</p>
<p>My daughter, I adopted her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her.</p>
<p>She was born in Russia,</p>
<p>though she came here when she was one.</p>
<p>My father in law.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically Russian.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a New Jersey boy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry to report.</p>
<p>My father in law passed away a week ago.</p>
<p>He lived with us for six years.</p>
<p>He lived in Russia till he was, oh, 70.</p>
<p>Saw Stalinist error.</p>
<p>His father was brought to a camp,</p>
<p>lived through World War II.</p>
<p>Much, much more.</p>
<p>Had an incredible life.</p>
<p>Never really learned how to speak English.</p>
<p>So I absorbed something Russian from him as well.</p>
<p>He was part Armenian.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my connection to Russia.</p>
<p>A bit of the Russian soul, too.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have it.</p>
<p>I think I appreciate it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s division of labor, right?</p>
<p>Others in the family.</p>
<p>Take care of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more superficial.</p>
<p>You mentioned Keats and that higher version,</p>
<p>that non Darwinian love.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s the highest form of human connection</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s intoxicating and it&rsquo;s part of building a life.</p>
<p>And most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of the highest realization</p>
<p>of you being what you can be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He mentioned you lost.</p>
<p>But ask a Russian.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a superficial New Jersey boy</p>
<p>who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen</p>
<p>and that was his romanticism.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite Bruce Springsteen song?</p>
<p>I think the album Born to Run has actually held up the best.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s very fashionable to think</p>
<p>the earlier or later works are actually better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the overproduced super pop album.</p>
<p>But the quality of the songs,</p>
<p>to me Born to Run is just far and away the best.</p>
<p>Then Darkness on the Edge of Town.</p>
<p>And those are still my favorites.</p>
<p>Born to Run is an incredible song.</p>
<p>And perfectly produced in a Phil Spector kind of way.</p>
<p>Every detail is right.</p>
<p>Every lyric.</p>
<p>What else is on the album?</p>
<p>Thunder Road, Jungle Land, Tenth Avenue, Freeze Out.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the one, unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah, Bruce is amazing.</p>
<p>Leading across the river.</p>
<p>I really like when he goes into love personally.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m on fire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good song, Dancing in the Dark.</p>
<p>A lot of the later work,</p>
<p>I find the percussion becomes too simple</p>
<p>and kind of too white somehow.</p>
<p>And a little clunky.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still good work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super talented, but it doesn&rsquo;t speak to me.</p>
<p>But when it all bursts open into the open road,</p>
<p>like it does on Born to Run, that&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or Rosalita.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen him live?</p>
<p>Yes, twice.</p>
<p>I wonder what he&rsquo;s like live when he was young, right?</p>
<p>Those years.</p>
<p>I saw him live when he was young.</p>
<p>I was young.</p>
<p>New Jersey.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed actually.</p>
<p>I think what I like best from him is quite studio.</p>
<p>He certainly played well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fault his performance.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Tremendous creators.</p>
<p>And they showed up.</p>
<p>They were not drunk.</p>
<p>Like they were paying attention.</p>
<p>But I was underwhelmed.</p>
<p>Because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album,</p>
<p>is much more of a studio band than you think at first.</p>
<p>And in the case of Bruce Springsteen,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but for me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s somebody that I connect with the most</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m alone and there&rsquo;s like a melancholy feeling.</p>
<p>And actually, my folks live in Philly.</p>
<p>I went to school in Philly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I&rsquo;ve, I think I&rsquo;ve.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost worthy of New Jersey then.</p>
<p>Yeah, well you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re almost worthy of Russia.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, we can connect.</p>
<p>And then ask, but I mean, I love Jersey.</p>
<p>This is something I feel like, I feel like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always, there&rsquo;s this beautiful,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a diner, Olga&rsquo;s Diner that closed down.</p>
<p>I used to go there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a melancholy feeling to me.</p>
<p>I mean, of course.</p>
<p>A thickness to culture in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Which is oddly similar to some elements</p>
<p>of the thickness of Russian culture.</p>
<p>And when you see like Russian characters on the Sopranos,</p>
<p>it totally makes sense,</p>
<p>even though there are these complete outliers.</p>
<p>Exactly, it totally makes sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, you mentioned you lost your father in law last week.</p>
<p>Do you think about mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about my own mortality that much,</p>
<p>which is probably a good thing.</p>
<p>I think death will be bad.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m afraid of it.</p>
<p>For me, the worst thing about death</p>
<p>is not knowing how the human story turns out.</p>
<p>The full human story.</p>
<p>So if I could, right before I die,</p>
<p>read like a Wikipedia page called The Rest of Human History</p>
<p>and have enough time, just like a few days,</p>
<p>to absorb it, think about it,</p>
<p>and know like, oh, well 643 years from now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when all the atomic weapons went off</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what happened between now and then,</p>
<p>I would feel much better dying.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s gonna be, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unlikely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide,</p>
<p>they kind of have, what is it?</p>
<p>They have a one or two sentence description of the human,</p>
<p>of what goes on on Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of intelligent civilizations out there</p>
<p>that in the big encyclopedia that describes the universe,</p>
<p>humans will only have one sentence, maybe two.</p>
<p>Probably true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the only one I can read and understand, right?</p>
<p>And it may be hard to understand the human one</p>
<p>past a number of centuries.</p>
<p>Yeah, with AI, yes.</p>
<p>Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia</p>
<p>be like trying to read Chaucer,</p>
<p>which I almost can do, but I actually can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I need a translation.</p>
<p>Probably you can&rsquo;t do it at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe reading will be outdated.</p>
<p>It might be a very silly notion.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re fundamentally,</p>
<p>like we think language is fundamental to cognition,</p>
<p>but it could be something visual</p>
<p>or something totally different that we&rsquo;ll plug in.</p>
<p>Neuralink or, yeah.</p>
<p>But in that story, that Wikipedia article,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;ll be a section on the meaning of it?</p>
<p>I hope not, because that section we could write now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not going to be very good, right?</p>
<p>What would you put in the section</p>
<p>on the meaning of human existence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, links to a lot of other sections?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are general statements</p>
<p>about the meaning of life that have that much meaning.</p>
<p>I think if you study different cultures,</p>
<p>the arts, travel, mathematics,</p>
<p>like whatever your thing is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a lot about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to read the page on the meaning.</p>
<p>I bet they have such a page, in fact.</p>
<p>The fact that I&rsquo;ve never visited it,</p>
<p>none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the page on the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been wondering about this.</p>
<p>You got to read this one.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s ever done that to you, have they?</p>
<p>It probably has, well, I&rsquo;ve actually gone to that page.</p>
<p>It does, in fact, have a lot of links to other pages.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The meaning of life is just a bunch of self referential</p>
<p>or citation needed type of statements.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better way to end it.</p>
<p>Tyler, it&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me.</p>
<p>It was one of the greatest conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>My pleasure and delighted to finally have met you</p>
<p>and that we can do this.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cowen</p>
<p>and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN,</p>
<p>SimpliSafe and Public Goods.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Little else is requisite to carry a state</p>
<p>to the highest degree of opulence</p>
<p>from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes</p>
<p>and a tolerable administration of justice.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
