It&amp;rsquo;s Hardcore History.
Attention.
‚ô™‚ô™
I&amp;rsquo;ve always said some of the best things
we do around here are apologies.
And so, I want to apologize if it seems as though
our subject matter and, um,
and the stuff we&amp;rsquo;re talking about lately
all kind of falls into a narrow sort of,
uh, subject matter or a, you know, historical period.
It&amp;rsquo;s mostly been 20th century stuff.
It&amp;rsquo;s not by design, but I don&amp;rsquo;t work by design.'>

    <p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said some of the best things</p>
<p>we do around here are apologies.</p>
<p>And so, I want to apologize if it seems as though</p>
<p>our subject matter and, um,</p>
<p>and the stuff we&rsquo;re talking about lately</p>
<p>all kind of falls into a narrow sort of,</p>
<p>uh, subject matter or a, you know, historical period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly been 20th century stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not by design, but I don&rsquo;t work by design.</p>
<p>I work on inspiration and sometimes opportunity.</p>
<p>For example, the opportunity to get a guest</p>
<p>like the one we have today.</p>
<p>So, things don&rsquo;t always work out in a balanced sort of way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;ll probably happen is that we&rsquo;ll end up</p>
<p>flipping at a certain point, and then I&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>getting emails from people saying,</p>
<p>why do you never talk about, you know,</p>
<p>20th century stuff?</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re just probably balancing things out</p>
<p>in the other direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk to Sir Max Hastings today.</p>
<p>Those of you who like military history, uh,</p>
<p>have certainly read his work. He&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>He wrote Inferno. He wrote a lot of other books.</p>
<p>If you look at his resume as it exists now,</p>
<p>well, if you had shown that to me when I was 21 years old,</p>
<p>I would have said, oh, that&rsquo;s the guy I wanna be.</p>
<p>His resume&rsquo;s long as heck. I mean,</p>
<p>foreign correspondent for the BBC,</p>
<p>editor-in-chief of the Daily Telegraph,</p>
<p>editor of the Evening Standard,</p>
<p>uh, war correspondent, um, author, prolific author.</p>
<p>All-around interesting person.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s written a new book on Vietnam.</p>
<p>And 800 pages, by the way. I mean, it&rsquo;s a tome.</p>
<p>At the same time, you know, if your library&rsquo;s like mine,</p>
<p>and you like having certain subjects covered,</p>
<p>uh, this is a necessary thing on my Vietnam section,</p>
<p>for any number of reasons.</p>
<p>Hastings has a, uh, connection to the war.</p>
<p>He was a war correspondent in it,</p>
<p>and it was sort of where he made his bones as a young guy.</p>
<p>Go Google him and look at the images of him</p>
<p>when he was there. My wife thought he looked like a beetle.</p>
<p>War correspondents are an interesting species.</p>
<p>Uh, they don&rsquo;t make them like they used to, I should say,</p>
<p>but at the same time, there are still some good ones.</p>
<p>They sort of have a foot in both worlds,</p>
<p>the soldier world and the civilian world here</p>
<p>of people that maybe don&rsquo;t know war at all.</p>
<p>And so, somehow, you need to be able to translate things</p>
<p>into a language where you can, you know,</p>
<p>reliably convey information so that they can understand it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to reliably transmit information</p>
<p>on what it&rsquo;s like to see a disemboweled village chief</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s had his stomach cut out in front of the villagers</p>
<p>by the Viet Cong as a lesson not to cooperate</p>
<p>with the Americans or the South Vietnamese.</p>
<p>How do you even relate that in a way</p>
<p>that people can understand and in a way</p>
<p>where they just don&rsquo;t not read about it?</p>
<p>At a certain point, if you get graphic enough,</p>
<p>people won&rsquo;t read about it, but then you haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re supposed to do as a war correspondent.</p>
<p>Now, just so you know, it&rsquo;s only personal weakness</p>
<p>that probably kept me from doing something like that.</p>
<p>I started reading because I was enamored with it.</p>
<p>All this stuff written, and sometimes written</p>
<p>about their own lives, that these war correspondents</p>
<p>had put into print. And at a certain point,</p>
<p>you start to realize, wait a minute,</p>
<p>do you really want to live with the memories</p>
<p>these guys have? And they&rsquo;re sort of warning you sometimes</p>
<p>when you read their books. I mean, they&rsquo;re telling you</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re dreaming about at night.</p>
<p>You deliberately, over and over and over again,</p>
<p>go to places where awful, awful things have happened.</p>
<p>Things soldiers see, by the way,</p>
<p>although they don&rsquo;t often want to be there when it happens.</p>
<p>The war correspondent, you know, to them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the story, right? Let&rsquo;s go to the bad place now.</p>
<p>Most of the soldiers are of the opinion</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want to go to the bad place.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>So, Max Hastings did this job,</p>
<p>which always, for me, makes an interesting read,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s filtering in real personal experiences,</p>
<p>tastes, smells, the lifestyle, the culture at the time,</p>
<p>that you just can&rsquo;t get researching secondhand sources.</p>
<p>It would have been a very different book</p>
<p>if Dan Carlin had written it from other people&rsquo;s stuff,</p>
<p>than to have a guy who was there,</p>
<p>who participated in the activities,</p>
<p>who interacted with all the people,</p>
<p>and then has had decades and decades</p>
<p>to see how history played out since,</p>
<p>and to think about it, and to sort of, you know,</p>
<p>integrate it into his overall worldview.</p>
<p>The result is this new book, and it&rsquo;s worth picking up</p>
<p>if you have interest or, you know, a lot of you, I know,</p>
<p>have a Vietnam section on your shelf.</p>
<p>If you wanted to say what the focus of the book is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s rightly put where it should be,</p>
<p>although it covers everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hardcore history of books.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the godlike view,</p>
<p>the hindsight view, the leadership view,</p>
<p>the mid-level view, the Hamlet view,</p>
<p>the what it&rsquo;s like to be the guy on the ground view,</p>
<p>which is why you get 800 pages or 26-hour</p>
<p>hardcore history series on the First World War.</p>
<p>Either way, it&rsquo;s explainable, you know, understandable.</p>
<p>The most interesting part to me,</p>
<p>since I already know the battle stuff,</p>
<p>although if you&rsquo;re into the battle stuff,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s awesome. Historically, he&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing for me, though,</p>
<p>is to see how he can synthesize all this stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened in the decades since that era.</p>
<p>I was born in 1965.</p>
<p>I was born, by the way, on one of the worst battles</p>
<p>of the war, the one they made the movie about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my birthday, November 14th, 1965,</p>
<p>Battle of the Eidrein Valley.</p>
<p>But when I was a kid, just starting to become aware,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s all the older brothers and those people</p>
<p>who were the ones being drafted,</p>
<p>who were living through all this stuff.</p>
<p>So, in the 1970s, it was&hellip; It&rsquo;s hard to explain.</p>
<p>This was a transition period in U.S. history.</p>
<p>So, this is what I want this introduction</p>
<p>to Max Hastings, Sir Max Hastings interview to be.</p>
<p>Let me sort of cover the bases again</p>
<p>for those who weren&rsquo;t there and try to set up</p>
<p>a little of this and let you know why it&rsquo;s important to you</p>
<p>and why it matters in history.</p>
<p>In this case, there is a before and after in U.S. history.</p>
<p>And we all know there&rsquo;s several, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got before and after the Civil War,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a classic one for people to use.</p>
<p>Before and after the Vietnam era.</p>
<p>Go look at a photograph of Americans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just choose a big city because there was a lot</p>
<p>of continuity in some of the less big cities</p>
<p>where people looked the same over the decades, right?</p>
<p>They are more conservative, changed less slowly,</p>
<p>less flashy, more down-to-earth people.</p>
<p>But you get some photos from an L.A., Chicago,</p>
<p>Miami, New York, some of the hip places, supposedly,</p>
<p>and you show a photo from 1963,</p>
<p>and you compare those same people in a photo in 1973,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even have to say another word</p>
<p>to know that the culture has totally changed.</p>
<p>The Vietnam War is one of the major factor points</p>
<p>that account for this. And there&rsquo;s several,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re much talked about.</p>
<p>You know, birth control pill, the sexual revolution,</p>
<p>uh, music, I mean, just, there&rsquo;s a number of major factors.</p>
<p>But without the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>you might not have any of those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the prime movers. And as a friend of mine</p>
<p>who was at the protest back in the day pointed out,</p>
<p>the prime mover was the fact that many people</p>
<p>might have to go and suffer in a war</p>
<p>that they really didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of.</p>
<p>That tends to concentrate the mind in a way</p>
<p>that just some ideological cause wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That prime mover pushed forward a lot of the era&rsquo;s change</p>
<p>in the zeitgeist, for lack of a better phrase.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s kind of strange, change in the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>But I mean, the culture flipped.</p>
<p>Now, once again, not in some places.</p>
<p>The American heartland was remarkably consistent.</p>
<p>But in many places, and in terms of what Madison Avenue</p>
<p>is feeding you, and what Hollywood&rsquo;s feeding you,</p>
<p>and all that stuff, the culture really changed.</p>
<p>Vietnam is an important point in that.</p>
<p>It was also an era of extreme disillusion with the government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain, once again,</p>
<p>how different Americans were before Vietnam and after.</p>
<p>If I just said, we believed our government,</p>
<p>that right there is hard to square.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so far beyond what most people today are raised with.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just you believed the person in your party.</p>
<p>In general, Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p>believed the president.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter who the president was.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think your government lied to you.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s naive, of course.</p>
<p>But maybe if you look at U.S. history</p>
<p>as equivalent to a person growing up,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re still in your dumb teens in that era as a country,</p>
<p>and learning some of these hard lessons,</p>
<p>like, you know, in power politics, people lie.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, is that you ended up</p>
<p>with something called a credibility gap,</p>
<p>where the president had lied so many times</p>
<p>that the American people weren&rsquo;t buying it at all.</p>
<p>Maybe if you had returned to some level of perceived</p>
<p>because it was always happening,</p>
<p>some perceived normalcy with the next president,</p>
<p>Americans could have had their faith</p>
<p>in the honesty of government restored,</p>
<p>but then you had Richard Nixon after Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s like being hit with a left and a right.</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson would probably, you know,</p>
<p>hook you and then uppercut you,</p>
<p>and Richard Nixon would hit you below the belt.</p>
<p>Whatever worked.</p>
<p>But as a country, the 70s was about sort of re-evaluating</p>
<p>a lot of the things Americans had taken for granted</p>
<p>in terms of our self-image and whatnot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe how Lone Ranger-ish</p>
<p>we felt at the time period. How, you know,</p>
<p>Philip Caputo in, um, well, he was the veteran</p>
<p>who wrote A Rumor of War, but he&rsquo;s quoted</p>
<p>in Sir Max Hastings&rsquo; new book, too.</p>
<p>Um, let me read it to you.</p>
<p>He sort of describes the way Americans felt</p>
<p>about themselves. And remember, this is in the post-</p>
<p>Second World War era, where the U.S. is just,</p>
<p>in our own minds, we saved Europe twice,</p>
<p>then we rebuilt it with our own tax dollars,</p>
<p>then we protected it from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and communism in the Cold War.</p>
<p>I mean, we were the good guys of history.</p>
<p>Hastings writes about Phil Caputo, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lieutenant Caputo, like General Westmoreland,</p>
<p>saw himself fulfilling the vision of John F. Kennedy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caputo then says, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If he was the king of Camelot,</p>
<p>then we were his knights, and Vietnam our crusade.</p>
<p>There was nothing we could not do,</p>
<p>because we were Americans.</p>
<p>And for the same reason, whatever we did was right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Their communist foes were, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The new barbarians who menaced the far-flung interests</p>
<p>of the new Rome.&rsquo;&rdquo; End quote.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to describe how the United States</p>
<p>saw itself as&hellip;</p>
<p>And the people especially, and the marketing materials,</p>
<p>as this force of good around the world.</p>
<p>And with this dominance, you know,</p>
<p>the Second World War gave the United States</p>
<p>a dominance that lasted for 15, 20 years,</p>
<p>in terms of a head start over a broken world.</p>
<p>And the power that that gave you</p>
<p>made you feel almost a responsibility</p>
<p>to do something good with it.</p>
<p>In his book, Sir Max Hastings writes, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There was in the U.S. an enormous self-confidence</p>
<p>and pride, not unlike that of the Germans before 1914,</p>
<p>a consciousness of national greatness seeking an outlet,</p>
<p>a searching for an appropriate challenge to their powers,</p>
<p>a refusal to believe that any problem</p>
<p>was beyond their capacity to solve.</p>
<p>Statesmen who might themselves have doubts</p>
<p>were conscious of a great groundswell</p>
<p>of public opinion bearing them on.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>This was the era where John F. Kennedy was saying,</p>
<p>you know, we will bear any burden</p>
<p>for the success of liberty.</p>
<p>The sacrificing that the country was willing to make.</p>
<p>It was the era where young people were motivated</p>
<p>by a sense of idealism that in some cases</p>
<p>led people to go to other countries and build,</p>
<p>you know, farms and chicken coops</p>
<p>and work in the Peace Corps,</p>
<p>to others who saw a similar sort of mission</p>
<p>to, you know, help people, especially poor people</p>
<p>in undeveloped countries who needed it,</p>
<p>by giving them a government that was free.</p>
<p>So you see this idealism amongst, you know,</p>
<p>all these young people across a wide spectrum of types.</p>
<p>Now, as far as background in the war,</p>
<p>so we have some context here.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go into this with Sir Max,</p>
<p>because, you know, let&rsquo;s not deal with the stuff</p>
<p>we can all find out beforehand.</p>
<p>But the Vietnam War, as many of you know,</p>
<p>is something that grows out of colonialism.</p>
<p>It was one of those territories</p>
<p>that a colonial power from Europe,</p>
<p>in this case, the French, controlled.</p>
<p>It was French Indochina.</p>
<p>They treated it the way that colonial powers</p>
<p>usually treat these places.</p>
<p>Puppets, they were bringing civilization was the line,</p>
<p>but truthfully, I mean, it was a bunch of French people</p>
<p>in nice hotels with Vietnamese waiters and whatnot.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that there weren&rsquo;t people</p>
<p>that liked it in Vietnam.</p>
<p>But when the Second World War was over,</p>
<p>and, you know, the anti-colonialism wave</p>
<p>was unleashed across the world,</p>
<p>Vietnam fell into a pattern of a lot of other places</p>
<p>that were trying to throw off the yoke</p>
<p>of their colonial masters.</p>
<p>And in the case of Vietnam, there was a war</p>
<p>before the American version of the Vietnam War</p>
<p>for a long time, a very bloody, nasty, dirty war</p>
<p>between the French and what were called the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>It was sometime during this period</p>
<p>where the ideas of fighting for Vietnam nationalism,</p>
<p>you know, the nation state, a free Vietnam</p>
<p>for Vietnamese, run by Vietnamese.</p>
<p>At some point, there are communists</p>
<p>who become part of that movement or were always part of it.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this connection between these militant,</p>
<p>nationalist Vietnamese movements and communism.</p>
<p>And this will be a poison pill for countries</p>
<p>like the United States throughout the later&hellip;</p>
<p>part of this conflict, because when the Vietnamese</p>
<p>eventually, after some nasty, nasty battles,</p>
<p>are able to win their independence from the French,</p>
<p>the United States has already gotten their toe in the water</p>
<p>in that region, not because they really want the French</p>
<p>to be the colonial masters anymore,</p>
<p>but because of that worry over communism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s hard to describe</p>
<p>to people today, is the role that the fear of communism</p>
<p>played in all the decision-making</p>
<p>and all the calculations.</p>
<p>Vietnam was just one of the many countries</p>
<p>that was supposedly part of the domino effect,</p>
<p>where you might say to yourself, as many Americans did,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know what Vietnam was, they couldn&rsquo;t pronounce it,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t find it on a map, so why do we have to send</p>
<p>our boys and our money to go fight and die there?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>And remember, this isn&rsquo;t malarkey.</p>
<p>The people who are spouting it generally believe it,</p>
<p>but that this is just another country that will be toppled</p>
<p>by the communists, and then that country will be consolidated</p>
<p>and start to try to topple the person next door.</p>
<p>The French had a different analogy.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t use dominoes, they used bowling pins.</p>
<p>But the idea and the image is the same, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a toppling from one to another to another,</p>
<p>and eventually you&rsquo;ll have the Soviet Union in Mexico.</p>
<p>There were a lot of problems, it turns out,</p>
<p>and Hastings&rsquo; book is good at pointing this out.</p>
<p>There were a lot of problems in the decision-makers&rsquo;</p>
<p>understanding of all this, which in hindsight seems crazy,</p>
<p>because when you look at how many people would die</p>
<p>in all these wars and how many would be killed,</p>
<p>Hastings&rsquo; book focuses on the civilians more than anything,</p>
<p>and rightly so, I think.</p>
<p>But when you see all of that, you yearn for a reason,</p>
<p>and you yearn for just wanting to believe</p>
<p>that the people who are making the decisions</p>
<p>are at least well-informed,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve gotten the experts,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve got people explaining to them,</p>
<p>well, let me explain the difference</p>
<p>between Soviet communism and Chinese communism,</p>
<p>and the relationship of Vietnam to either of those.</p>
<p>I mean, that was already in some cases below</p>
<p>where the threshold where anybody was paying attention.</p>
<p>And for much of this conflict,</p>
<p>and for others during this time period,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this belief that Moscow controls everything</p>
<p>in the communist world, and that just wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re basing</p>
<p>all your decision-making on, well, it&rsquo;s no wonder</p>
<p>that things worked out the way they did sometimes.</p>
<p>I mean, there were occasions where our government</p>
<p>just thought the other side was being stubborn,</p>
<p>when in reality, we were talking to the people</p>
<p>who had no control over the events we wanted to influence,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe you could have such momentous decisions</p>
<p>regularly made with such either bad intelligence</p>
<p>or lack of understanding.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, this is one of the things</p>
<p>that waiting a couple of decades,</p>
<p>or in this case, five decades after the events,</p>
<p>sort of makes clear. You have a chance.</p>
<p>And another thing Hastings Book is very good at,</p>
<p>you have a chance to get the other side&rsquo;s point of view</p>
<p>to interview those people.</p>
<p>Um, considering that we&rsquo;re starting to lose</p>
<p>that generation just like the Second World War generation,</p>
<p>Hastings&rsquo; book might turn out to be one of those</p>
<p>really important things on a shelf for a very long time,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t replicate those discussions</p>
<p>he had with the principals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you remember this period,</p>
<p>you remember that part of the problem,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of our good guy image to ourselves,</p>
<p>was some of the news that was coming out of this place.</p>
<p>And what ended up happening in a nutshell,</p>
<p>is something that you see happen in a lot of other places.</p>
<p>You saw it with the French in their war in North Africa,</p>
<p>right, in places like Algeria in the 1950s,</p>
<p>where it becomes a dirty war.</p>
<p>When you have civilians carrying bombs,</p>
<p>and kids throwing grenades into restaurants,</p>
<p>and people hiding, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult after a while,</p>
<p>uh, to keep your troops from doing the sorts of things</p>
<p>that the folks back home imagine that their troops don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>In the case of the United States,</p>
<p>things happened in the Vietnam War</p>
<p>that if you had gone back a mere 15, 16, 17 years before,</p>
<p>and asked the American public whether anything like this</p>
<p>was ever possible from American soldiers,</p>
<p>they would have denied it to high heaven.</p>
<p>The My Lai Massacre, for example.</p>
<p>But there was regular bad stuff going on.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re gonna proclaim something like</p>
<p>a free fire zone, which of course in Vietnam was famous,</p>
<p>which means that anyone you see in this area</p>
<p>is considered a bad person by default,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not going to be a good tally</p>
<p>at the end of the year, when you start trying to figure out</p>
<p>how many actual enemy you killed versus how many,</p>
<p>you know, people who just got in the way,</p>
<p>wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>And that became another problem with the war.</p>
<p>The war had very&hellip; I mean, there were constraints</p>
<p>on the war, and the constraints are things</p>
<p>that we still talk about today.</p>
<p>Because it was the Cold War, and because it was</p>
<p>people had nuclear weapons, and because the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the Chinese were on the other side,</p>
<p>and because we had just fought a sort of an undeclared,</p>
<p>well, really undeclared war that started against Korea,</p>
<p>but ended up being American troops</p>
<p>and Chinese troops killing each other,</p>
<p>the last thing that anybody wanted</p>
<p>was another one of those.</p>
<p>So, there was always an attempt to keep the war confined</p>
<p>to certain parameters.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;ve got this fire burning,</p>
<p>and you just want to make sure that the fire doesn&rsquo;t spread.</p>
<p>But at all times, any conflict, especially one going on</p>
<p>as long as the Vietnam War did,</p>
<p>is a potential flashpoint in World War III.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s remember, as bad as Vietnam was,</p>
<p>imagine how bad something like that could have been</p>
<p>if it became the equivalent of, you know,</p>
<p>Gavrilo Princip shooting an archduke in Sarajevo in 1914.</p>
<p>And we wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about two or three million</p>
<p>Vietnamese civilians dying in this war.</p>
<p>We would be talking about 100, 200 million people,</p>
<p>and us still, you know, clearing out the ashes today.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s try to remember the big picture</p>
<p>that the leaders in this story are trying to juggle</p>
<p>at all times.</p>
<p>So, you have lack of good information,</p>
<p>with nuclear weapons as your punishment if you screw up,</p>
<p>no pressure there, right?</p>
<p>But the 1970s were about coming to some sort</p>
<p>of emotional terms with this, and there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Those of us who lived through it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost not worth talking about</p>
<p>because we remember it so well, and it was so&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it was beaten to death by the end,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>But new generations coming up don&rsquo;t remember any of this.</p>
<p>It was a very different post-war world</p>
<p>for the veterans who came back from Vietnam</p>
<p>because this was a war we lost,</p>
<p>and Americans, I can again say from experience,</p>
<p>we used to be very proud of the fact that you could say,</p>
<p>we never lost a war.</p>
<p>We used to be very proud of the fact that you could say,</p>
<p>we never lost a war.</p>
<p>You Canadians do not need to write me about the War of 1812.</p>
<p>I realize that that&rsquo;s a eye of the beholder issue</p>
<p>a little bit, and I don&rsquo;t want to get into a couple of others</p>
<p>with you, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Theoretically, kind of, sort of, you know, in our own minds,</p>
<p>we never lost a war.</p>
<p>Vietnam was hard to deny.</p>
<p>Vietnam also broke the army for a while.</p>
<p>And this is a point that&rsquo;s well understood</p>
<p>if you read about this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not talked about a lot.</p>
<p>What it did to the U.S. Army between, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>65 and 70 was amazing.</p>
<p>Again, something you wouldn&rsquo;t have thought could happen</p>
<p>to an American army, but then it hadn&rsquo;t been put</p>
<p>in that kind of situation before.</p>
<p>As we said, look at the French and Algeria.</p>
<p>You find yourselves in these kinds of situations,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>You add drug abuse, um, you add the short tour of duty.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things. The army really looked</p>
<p>at a lot of things after the war to try to figure out</p>
<p>what had happened. And if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in that subject, by the way, Andrew J. Bacevich</p>
<p>has written several books, um, describing the rebuilding</p>
<p>of the U.S. military after Vietnam and what was required,</p>
<p>and the safeguards that the military brass</p>
<p>tried to put into place to keep the civilians</p>
<p>from ever putting them in that situation again.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work, but there were safeguards put into it.</p>
<p>Colin Powell&rsquo;s written about this, too,</p>
<p>and he was involved in some of this stuff.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t talk about that very much</p>
<p>for the, you know, you could look at the American Army</p>
<p>in 1973, whew, and that&rsquo;s from the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just, you know, the morale and whatnot.</p>
<p>I mean, there was, um, a real, I mean, fragging</p>
<p>was something that was talked about a lot.</p>
<p>And you know what fragging is, right?</p>
<p>The shooting of your own officers,</p>
<p>or the, you know, you throw a grenade at them</p>
<p>when no one&rsquo;s looking. We were fragging our officers</p>
<p>sometimes. You don&rsquo;t fight a lot of that</p>
<p>from the Second World War, but in the Second World War,</p>
<p>we had a very different kind of U.S. image.</p>
<p>And the thing about the image is,</p>
<p>you kind of live up to that, or you try to, right?</p>
<p>So you say, Americans don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>It became hard to say, Americans don&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>after Vietnam. It was the war that proved</p>
<p>that we were human.</p>
<p>Right? We were as good guys as we tried to be,</p>
<p>but we were human.</p>
<p>Anybody who goes back and dives deep into things</p>
<p>like the Philippine insurrection,</p>
<p>or, you know, some of the Native American wars,</p>
<p>certainly, we&rsquo;ve proven this point before</p>
<p>in U.S. history. Nonetheless, you kind of need</p>
<p>to relearn it every generation or two, it seems.</p>
<p>One of the other things Hastings focuses on,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s an excellent point,</p>
<p>is how bad the other side was.</p>
<p>There is, as he said, a little self-flagellation</p>
<p>on the part of Americans, but it was a hard thing</p>
<p>for us to absorb. I mean, it&rsquo;s a huge deal.</p>
<p>The country was wrestling with huge issues</p>
<p>in the 1970s and early 1980s about this.</p>
<p>I was in one of the early courses,</p>
<p>and 60 Minutes did a whole big thing on this,</p>
<p>because it was groundbreaking at the time,</p>
<p>that undergraduates were taking at universities</p>
<p>where the Vietnam War was on the curriculum.</p>
<p>And one of the things that they would do</p>
<p>is bring in these veterans to talk to you,</p>
<p>you know, in every class.</p>
<p>So I took one at the University of Colorado,</p>
<p>and we had a veteran who sat in the back of the class,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t know he was a veteran,</p>
<p>because these guys were like 32, 33 years old</p>
<p>when they were talking to our class.</p>
<p>Sat in the back of the classroom the whole time,</p>
<p>and then like after eight weeks or something,</p>
<p>stood up and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching this whole class as part of my recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to come to grips with all this.</p>
<p>We actually showed a movie in the class</p>
<p>that showed a helicopter door gunner,</p>
<p>and he said, that movie showed me.</p>
<p>I was the helicopter door gunner you saw in that film.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>But we were all wrestling with things back then,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to describe to a generation now</p>
<p>who grows up in an era where no one ever believes</p>
<p>their government, and that&rsquo;s just the right way to be,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>the United States is fully seen as basically a good guy,</p>
<p>but fully fallible.</p>
<p>The fallible part was not something</p>
<p>that people thought of, say, in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>We were a force for good only in our minds,</p>
<p>and so it was this huge&hellip;</p>
<p>mental rearrangement.</p>
<p>In the 70s, if you look at the material,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>um, introspection.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just introspection amongst the general population,</p>
<p>but the military also, and the political class.</p>
<p>Um, when we eventually, I believe, was it Panama?</p>
<p>Like, 1989 or something?</p>
<p>When that happened, I think President Bush I</p>
<p>had said something like, you know,</p>
<p>we finally kicked the Vietnam syndrome or whatnot.</p>
<p>And the Vietnam syndrome was the after effect,</p>
<p>where all of a sudden, the United States didn&rsquo;t wanna go</p>
<p>and mess with other countries for a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d had enough of that for a while.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just, um, the soldiers who had died</p>
<p>and were wounded, or the veterans who were</p>
<p>increasingly showing signs of being badly affected</p>
<p>by what happened to them in the war,</p>
<p>but the cost and the blowback.</p>
<p>And there was just this feeling for a while, no more.</p>
<p>But again, time passes and people change,</p>
<p>and you forget just how bad it can be.</p>
<p>When things go wrong, and make no mistake about it,</p>
<p>things went wrong in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The idea that the United States of America,</p>
<p>after the Second World War, we&rsquo;re still at this pinnacle</p>
<p>of industrial might and military power.</p>
<p>The idea that a bunch of backward guerrillas</p>
<p>in what we called a third world country</p>
<p>with no money and no, I mean, they&rsquo;ve got no air,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing that they could beat us?</p>
<p>That right there was a hard pill to swallow,</p>
<p>but it reminded military and political leaders once again,</p>
<p>that war is not disconnected from politics,</p>
<p>as Clausewitz so famously said.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re really after in any of these situations</p>
<p>is a political settlement, or a political change.</p>
<p>If your enemy, or your adversary, or your opponent</p>
<p>does not give in when you beat the hell out of them</p>
<p>and give you what you want politically, you don&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>The United States did not lose a major encounter</p>
<p>in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>And the bigger the encounter, the more likely</p>
<p>the United States won, and won big.</p>
<p>One of the most famous, most Americans</p>
<p>that know anything about this war</p>
<p>have heard the words, Tet Offensive, before.</p>
<p>It was a famous Vietnamese, Northern Vietnamese&hellip;</p>
<p>attack in many places at once, that was a disaster for them.</p>
<p>But it was not portrayed that way at the time.</p>
<p>I remember one veteran explaining to me</p>
<p>just how unbelievable the casualties were</p>
<p>that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong suffered</p>
<p>in that offensive.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t about body counts.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t fighting a war for body counts,</p>
<p>they were fighting a war for a political settlement.</p>
<p>And because the United States had lied to its people</p>
<p>so often about how the war was going,</p>
<p>what the other side did by sacrificing a ton</p>
<p>of their people and material, was say,</p>
<p>hey, war&rsquo;s not over, and at the same time,</p>
<p>basically demonstrate to everyone</p>
<p>that what they&rsquo;d been told was false.</p>
<p>Which turned the people once more</p>
<p>against the political regime.</p>
<p>If you think about this, I hate to do this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, um&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no respect, I mean, it just seems wrong,</p>
<p>but if you think about it like a game,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing one side or the other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to see how if you get to be</p>
<p>the North Vietnamese communist side in this,</p>
<p>how little you have to play with in terms of real pieces</p>
<p>that have any power. The other side&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>all the good pieces, and yet, there&rsquo;s ways</p>
<p>to win without them. And that&rsquo;s what, I mean,</p>
<p>the guy, when I was growing up, guys in black pajamas</p>
<p>beat the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Incomprehensible.</p>
<p>But an entire generation of military personnel,</p>
<p>who were mostly junior officers in that war,</p>
<p>would grow up to influence the way</p>
<p>the U.S. military developed, 10, 15, 20, 25 years,</p>
<p>and now all the way to now.</p>
<p>And the footprints of Vietnam are all over this military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back, mostly.</p>
<p>And while it would be sort of outside the norms</p>
<p>of human history to expect us not to make</p>
<p>the same mistakes, they certainly changed</p>
<p>a bunch of things so that, well, this war will never be lost</p>
<p>in America&rsquo;s living rooms again, as the old saying was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s astounding, and I&rsquo;ll wrap it up sort of here.</p>
<p>When you listen to Sir Max Hastings</p>
<p>as a war correspondent, the kind of freedom</p>
<p>that they had to cover that war.</p>
<p>And it was a weird situation, because if you look</p>
<p>at press coverage in the Second World War and Korea,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly regulated and censored.</p>
<p>So, then the next big war after Korea,</p>
<p>Korea ends in, what, 51, 52?</p>
<p>The next big war starts ramping up, 63, 64,</p>
<p>in Vietnam with a lot of advisors.</p>
<p>I mean, what, 16,500 at one point</p>
<p>before the real troops came in.</p>
<p>The media, all of a sudden, doesn&rsquo;t have those constraints</p>
<p>for really the first time in modern American history,</p>
<p>certainly. And they seem to get less and less constrained</p>
<p>as the war goes on. And when you see some of these,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one famous firefight where the reporter is,</p>
<p>well, I think it&rsquo;s during Tet, where the reporter walks up</p>
<p>to U.S. troops that are at a wall,</p>
<p>I think maybe Marines, that are at a wall,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fighting something right on the other side</p>
<p>of the wall, and they are reloading their weapons</p>
<p>and then standing up and shooting</p>
<p>at the other side of the wall, and the reporter walks</p>
<p>right up and starts interviewing the guy</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s reloading his gun during the firefight.</p>
<p>Now, two things stand out at you right there.</p>
<p>Number one is, that&rsquo;s a ballsy reporter, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a war correspondent of the sort</p>
<p>that are just, they&rsquo;re amazing, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had an admiration for their willingness</p>
<p>to go get the story when they go get the story like that.</p>
<p>I mean, Ernie Pyle was killed by a sniper,</p>
<p>machine gun, I think, actually,</p>
<p>you know, covering the Second World War.</p>
<p>But the other thing you realize is that that is absolutely</p>
<p>uncensored war content coming right back</p>
<p>to America&rsquo;s living rooms.</p>
<p>And if I recall, going from memory here,</p>
<p>when the reporter asked the soldier something like,</p>
<p>you know, what did he want or anything,</p>
<p>he just, I want to get out of here.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? It was one of these,</p>
<p>I just want to get out of here. I just want to get&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it was not a pro-war rah-rah-rah thing.</p>
<p>It was something that the folks at home would go,</p>
<p>oh, my goodness. Now, here&rsquo;s two sides to this.</p>
<p>Um, side number one is, that&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>And please put me firmly in the camp of, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna go to these wars and you&rsquo;re gonna expect</p>
<p>people to support them, they have to know what it is.</p>
<p>And they have to know what it is in living color,</p>
<p>just like that. So, I&rsquo;m on that side.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s understand that the other side,</p>
<p>as Max Hastings points out in this book,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t show their people that kind of press coverage.</p>
<p>Right? So, they&rsquo;re rigidly controlling</p>
<p>what the communist people see.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get to see all their death,</p>
<p>all their suffering, all their atrocities.</p>
<p>And the other side&rsquo;s got it in living color.</p>
<p>And our friends who don&rsquo;t like us so much,</p>
<p>there were some countries that, you know,</p>
<p>love-hate relationships, sort of,</p>
<p>they play this stuff up huge.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice, we didn&rsquo;t have Americans</p>
<p>doing much protesting during the Second World War.</p>
<p>We were bombing Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t had, by Vietnam standards,</p>
<p>much in the way of those things since Vietnam.</p>
<p>We had a few big ones, but, you know, nothing sustained.</p>
<p>Vietnam, there was sustained pressure</p>
<p>with lots and lots of people protesting for a long time.</p>
<p>Um, haven&rsquo;t had that since either.</p>
<p>Could you suggest that maybe it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t being exposed to the same sort of,</p>
<p>uh, video and photos and stories</p>
<p>that the American people saw in the 1960s and 1970s?</p>
<p>Well, if so, then you can call that one of the,</p>
<p>I guess, successful reforms that the Army and Navy</p>
<p>and Marine Corps leaders, the Air Force leaders,</p>
<p>learned from that era.</p>
<p>If they believed that the war was lost in the living room,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t do that again, and we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But back in Sir Max Hastings&rsquo; day, we did.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m pleased to introduce, if you&rsquo;ve never heard him,</p>
<p>oh, my goodness, if you&rsquo;ve never read his books,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a military history fan,</p>
<p>um, well, then you have a whole bunch to pick up.</p>
<p>I mean, Inferno, go get Inferno, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>But this latest one on Vietnam, also fantastic.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, I&rsquo;m honored to talk</p>
<p>to Sir Max Hastings today about his new book, Vietnam.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Is this Sir Max?</p>
<p>Yeah, it sure is. Hello, Dan.</p>
<p>Hello. Listen, thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve got you on the book publicity,</p>
<p>uh, factory assembly line tour.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless and fun as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be, it&rsquo;ll be completely painless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice for you to have me on the show.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a big fan, actually.</p>
<p>Um, I will admit, though, I haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>through the latest book. I didn&rsquo;t get it in time.</p>
<p>Uh, I&rsquo;m enjoying it immensely, though,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a subject near and dear to my heart,</p>
<p>as all Americans in my generation have.</p>
<p>My generation probably had no way to avoid.</p>
<p>Well, what generation? How old does that make you?</p>
<p>I was born during the Battle of the, uh,</p>
<p>of the Ai Drang Valley.</p>
<p>So, November 14th, 1965. I&rsquo;m 52.</p>
<p>Oh, well, that makes you, um, a generation younger than me.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, listen, I want to talk about that a little bit.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s fascinating to read something</p>
<p>from a 21st century perspective</p>
<p>that I actually grew up in the wake or the wash of.</p>
<p>Uh, and I was wondering, um,</p>
<p>how different is this book</p>
<p>from something you would have written</p>
<p>much more closer to the time you were in country?</p>
<p>Now, for example, the audience doesn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>so let me make sure that they do.</p>
<p>Um, this is a book from a British perspective,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t normally get with Vietnam War books.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s also, um, it&rsquo;s also able to, as I said,</p>
<p>give us a 21st century look back at something</p>
<p>that many of the books I was reading</p>
<p>were written in the 1980s, for example,</p>
<p>and you were actually there.</p>
<p>So, so give me a perspective a little bit</p>
<p>on how writing this book now was different than,</p>
<p>than how the 25 or 28-year-old Sir Max Hastings</p>
<p>would have written it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a very, very different book</p>
<p>from the one that I would have written</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d been stupid enough to write it</p>
<p>back in the 1960s.</p>
<p>But although I&rsquo;m British,</p>
<p>America and its history has been deeply etched</p>
<p>into my own experience,</p>
<p>because I lived here in 67, 68,</p>
<p>and I witnessed the huge demonstrations.</p>
<p>Um, I met a lot of the key players,</p>
<p>the Robert Kennedys, the Eugene McCarthys,</p>
<p>and I went to the White House</p>
<p>and listened to Lyndon Johnson</p>
<p>haranguing a group of us foreign journalists</p>
<p>about why he was so passionately committed to the war.</p>
<p>And this was in January 1968.</p>
<p>And, of course, we were hugely impressed</p>
<p>to be meeting the president.</p>
<p>There was me, 22 years old,</p>
<p>sitting in the cabinet room.</p>
<p>And Johnson, he behaved in many ways</p>
<p>quite like his caricature in that he started out</p>
<p>by saying, saying,</p>
<p>uh, some of you may like blondes</p>
<p>and some of you may like redheads</p>
<p>and some of you may not like women at all,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m here this morning to tell you what kind I like.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m prepared to sit down</p>
<p>with hoachy men and a nice hotel with nice food</p>
<p>and sit down to talk to settle this thing.</p>
<p>And he spoke for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>And then he got up and he didn&rsquo;t take questions.</p>
<p>He said, right, very nice to meet you all.</p>
<p>He went out of the room.</p>
<p>But then suddenly, just as we were gathering together</p>
<p>our notes, and we&rsquo;d been hugely impressed,</p>
<p>as how could we not be?</p>
<p>I mean, I was by far the youngest of the group,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, we were all quite a young group</p>
<p>and meeting the president of the United States.</p>
<p>But suddenly, he put his head around the door again,</p>
<p>a little bit sheepishly.</p>
<p>And he came back in and he said,</p>
<p>before you all go, I&rsquo;d like to ask you all one question.</p>
<p>Meeting me, have any of you changed your minds</p>
<p>about anything you read or heard about me before you came?</p>
<p>And we were absolutely stunned in the silence</p>
<p>by the spectacle of the president of the United States</p>
<p>carrying sixpence, what a load of kids like us thought.</p>
<p>But that was a reflection of how vulnerable Johnson felt then.</p>
<p>And then, of course, a couple of years later,</p>
<p>I went to Vietnam for BBC television.</p>
<p>And I did quite a lot of reporting there,</p>
<p>right through until 75, when I came out of the embassy</p>
<p>compound in the final evacuation.</p>
<p>So this was all etched deep in my experience.</p>
<p>But the key thing that has changed, meanwhile,</p>
<p>is that I very much bought into the idea</p>
<p>that not only was this a disastrous war, which indeed</p>
<p>it was, but that because the United States was tied up</p>
<p>with a bad cause, that therefore, the other sides</p>
<p>must be a good cause.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve now come to believe, having studied</p>
<p>a huge amount of material from North Vietnam</p>
<p>and from the communist side and so on,</p>
<p>that really, North Vietnam and South Vietnam,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe, were two rival tyrannies.</p>
<p>And the idea that Ho Chi Minh was a good guy,</p>
<p>any more than Mao Tse Tung was or Che Guevara,</p>
<p>these were absolutely ruthless revolutionaries.</p>
<p>And they did terrible stuff.</p>
<p>And whereas everybody has seen the pictures</p>
<p>of the South Vietnamese police chief executing the Vietcong</p>
<p>prisoner in 1968, and the naked kid running away</p>
<p>after a South Vietnamese napalm strike,</p>
<p>the communists made very sure that there</p>
<p>were no photographs of many of the dreadful things</p>
<p>that their side did, the terrorism that, I mean,</p>
<p>for instance, there&rsquo;s an entirely reliably sourced</p>
<p>story of one among many village chiefs who</p>
<p>was being buried alive in the Mekong Delta</p>
<p>in the early 1960s by the local communists</p>
<p>in front of all his fellow villagers</p>
<p>to demonstrate that the price of rejecting the revolution</p>
<p>was much worse than mere death.</p>
<p>And he pleaded for a merciful bullet.</p>
<p>And the communist cadres just said</p>
<p>that they saved their bullets for the imperialists.</p>
<p>And in the Tet Offensive of 1968,</p>
<p>when thousands of perfectly innocent people</p>
<p>whose worst crime was to support the South Vietnamese</p>
<p>government were executed in cold blood by the communists,</p>
<p>again, no pictures.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t see all this stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come to believe that, although I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>for a moment that the war was winnable,</p>
<p>that we did allow ourselves, all those of us</p>
<p>who were correspondents there and all those of us</p>
<p>who were reporting the war, all we could see</p>
<p>and most of the stuff we were writing about</p>
<p>was what a terrible mess the United States</p>
<p>and the South Vietnamese were making of it.</p>
<p>And yet, we saw in 1975 that when the communists gained</p>
<p>power, the ruthlessness and the incompetence with which they</p>
<p>behaved, starvation descended on the Vietnamese people</p>
<p>in the 1980s.</p>
<p>And any idea that the other side were the good guys</p>
<p>now seems to be out of order.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come very strongly to believe</p>
<p>what is true of most events in history,</p>
<p>that neither side had a monopoly of virtue or vice.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>The second thing I think is hugely important</p>
<p>is that we were overwhelmingly influenced by the fact</p>
<p>that we were with the Americans and with the US Army</p>
<p>and the US Marine Corps and so on.</p>
<p>And we saw this through an American prism.</p>
<p>And yet, this was overwhelmingly a Vietnamese tragedy,</p>
<p>that while 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam,</p>
<p>something over 2 million, 2 million Vietnamese</p>
<p>died, at least 40 for every American,</p>
<p>not to mention countless Lao and Cambodians as well.</p>
<p>So I spent a huge amount of time researching</p>
<p>Vietnamese sources and interviewing Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And sure, there are a lot of Americans in my story</p>
<p>because the Americans made the big decisions.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also tried to put the Vietnamese where</p>
<p>they belong, which is at the center of the stage</p>
<p>of this huge tragedy.</p>
<p>Well, I think you bring up an interesting quandary</p>
<p>that people today can understand because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>confronted with it not that uncommonly,</p>
<p>even in the modern world, which is with the communists</p>
<p>as bad as they were in doing all these things,</p>
<p>you were talking about.</p>
<p>Without knowing how the war was going to turn out,</p>
<p>does that legitimize the involvement of one</p>
<p>of the two great superpowers of the time?</p>
<p>In other words, can you make a moral case</p>
<p>that the right thing was done because this sort of thing</p>
<p>was happening and it was understood</p>
<p>that if the communists took over South Vietnam,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be a bloodbath and all these other things?</p>
<p>And yet, all of the things that you talk about</p>
<p>in the later part of your book after the US get involved</p>
<p>shows exactly how nasty it is for the Vietnamese people,</p>
<p>as you pointed out, when we did get involved</p>
<p>for all the right reasons.</p>
<p>How should 50 years of thinking about this</p>
<p>and seeing how things play out in the region,</p>
<p>how do you square the difference between</p>
<p>it might be morally right to go in there</p>
<p>and try to save these people from a terrible fate,</p>
<p>and yet while doing so, inflict an even worse fate on them?</p>
<p>I mean, how do you square, how does that go</p>
<p>in your head these days?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re touching an absolutely essential point,</p>
<p>which I think is very important,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve quoted in my book,</p>
<p>two people I great respect, Senator Eugene McCarthy,</p>
<p>whom I got to know a bit when I was a young reporter</p>
<p>covering his campaign in 68,</p>
<p>and General Jim Gavin, whom I also knew,</p>
<p>who was a World War II paratroop hero.</p>
<p>And Jim Gavin and Eugene McCarthy both said,</p>
<p>at a pretty early stage, they said,</p>
<p>whatever the virtue of your cause,</p>
<p>if you fight over a village five or six times,</p>
<p>an awful lot of people are gonna die,</p>
<p>and you find yourself thinking at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be some proportionality,</p>
<p>that even if what you want to achieve in a place,</p>
<p>and especially in Vietnam,</p>
<p>is something that is worthwhile and decent,</p>
<p>that in the end, you find yourself in danger</p>
<p>of destroying the very thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to try to save.</p>
<p>And there has to be proportionality.</p>
<p>And one point, which is at the core of my own book,</p>
<p>is that I think a mistake we&rsquo;ve made in the past,</p>
<p>and we go on making, and remember,</p>
<p>the British have been very much associated</p>
<p>with the United States in Iraq and in Afghanistan and so on,</p>
<p>is that although there has to be a military dimension</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do these interventions,</p>
<p>the key thing is always cultural and social and economic.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t have some sort of cultural engagement</p>
<p>with these societies in which you intervene,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re completely wasting your time winning firefights.</p>
<p>And to me, and I&rsquo;ve said this in the last chapter of my book,</p>
<p>you go on winning firefights in these places</p>
<p>and killing bad guys till the cows come home,</p>
<p>but unless you&rsquo;ve got some linkage with the local people,</p>
<p>and I was always very struck</p>
<p>by somebody who&rsquo;s become a friend,</p>
<p>H.R. McMaster, who more recently</p>
<p>was Donald Trump&rsquo;s national security advisor,</p>
<p>that H.R. McMaster,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an outstanding American army officer,</p>
<p>one day about 2006, we were having lunch together,</p>
<p>and he was telling me about all the great things</p>
<p>that his Armored Cavalry Regiment had done in Iraq.</p>
<p>And then he ended up by saying,</p>
<p>the trouble was there was nothing to join up to.</p>
<p>Now, what he meant was that there was no local government,</p>
<p>no local community to be able to fill in after.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d finished winning the battles.</p>
<p>And exactly the same, Neil Sheehan,</p>
<p>a very famous American correspondent in Vietnam,</p>
<p>when I was telling him that story a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>and we were discussing it,</p>
<p>he said it was the same problem in Vietnam.</p>
<p>There was nothing to join up to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said in my book that I think the main reason</p>
<p>that the Communists ended up winning in Vietnam</p>
<p>was not because they were particularly better soldiers,</p>
<p>but because they were Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And always this problem,</p>
<p>and one sees it in Iraq and Afghanistan again,</p>
<p>that a lot of the time the locals don&rsquo;t like foreigners,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re British or American or whatever.</p>
<p>And I talked to a Vietnamese</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now become a very successful businessman</p>
<p>in California.</p>
<p>And he was saying to me that when he was living in Vietnam</p>
<p>as a young man, he said,</p>
<p>the Communists were constantly reminding us</p>
<p>how humiliating it was to be occupied by the Americans.</p>
<p>They had the monopoly of patriotism.</p>
<p>What we have to try and find ways of doing</p>
<p>in these interventions is how to,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not trying to help these people,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t take over their countries.</p>
<p>And of course the United States was effectively,</p>
<p>from 64, 65, everybody knew that the South Vietnamese</p>
<p>who were supposed to be running the country</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed in the morning</p>
<p>without asking the Americans which side to get out.</p>
<p>And the Communists were able to exploit that.</p>
<p>So although I&rsquo;m in any idea that,</p>
<p>as all the kids thought in the 60s,</p>
<p>that Ho Chi Minh was a sort of saintly figure.</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh was a ruthless revolutionary.</p>
<p>But he had achieved a status, a stature,</p>
<p>as the victor in the colonial war against the French,</p>
<p>which the United States and what the United States call,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got my old press card from Vietnam,</p>
<p>free world forces,</p>
<p>were never able to find anybody who looked like the patriot</p>
<p>and the hero and the nationalist</p>
<p>that Ho Chi Minh died on the Southern side.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, the longer I write history books</p>
<p>and the more you come to learn that very often</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s good v evil and the black v white.</p>
<p>These things are always very complicated.</p>
<p>And I felt, even when I was a young reporter in Vietnam,</p>
<p>I never thought the United States</p>
<p>looked like winning this war.</p>
<p>But even then I never felt the other side deserved to either.</p>
<p>You know, you bring up some very interesting points</p>
<p>in the book that are the sort of things</p>
<p>that make you feel like the government is inept.</p>
<p>And then you realize, but we do it over and over again.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s built into the cake, as we say.</p>
<p>For example, and to piggyback off the point you just made</p>
<p>about the South Vietnamese government</p>
<p>trying to appear as though they&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>as much of a nationalist war as the North is.</p>
<p>And yet when we first put Marines on shore in 1965,</p>
<p>as you pointed out in your book,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t even tell the South Vietnamese government</p>
<p>we were going to do it.</p>
<p>Those are the kind of things where you would have loved</p>
<p>to have been a fly on the wall in the meetings about this.</p>
<p>Did somebody bring that up and say,</p>
<p>this is going to look really bad if we spring this on them?</p>
<p>Or was it, or was the tenor of the times</p>
<p>such that worrying about what a puppet government,</p>
<p>I guess maybe some people would have called it,</p>
<p>thought about this was not on their top 10 list of concern?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that always struck me,</p>
<p>and I also said in the book,</p>
<p>was between the 1950s, the 1970s,</p>
<p>all the hotshot meetings in Washington</p>
<p>about Vietnam policy,</p>
<p>no Vietnamese ever attended any of them.</p>
<p>It was always Americans who held the meetings</p>
<p>to decide what was going to be done in Saigon.</p>
<p>And you find, and again, I&rsquo;ve quoted all the examples.</p>
<p>There were several times when they discussed in Washington</p>
<p>whether they should change the Vietnamese government.</p>
<p>But when President Thieu in 1974, sorry, 73,</p>
<p>looked like refusing to sign the peace deal</p>
<p>that Henry Kissinger had stitched up in Paris</p>
<p>with the North Vietnamese,</p>
<p>there was a serious discussion in Washington</p>
<p>about whether to just get rid of President Thieu</p>
<p>and put in another Vietnamese president.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not too surprising</p>
<p>that the Vietnamese feel humiliated.</p>
<p>I mean, all human relations about who makes who feel good.</p>
<p>And Americans did not make Vietnamese feel good.</p>
<p>And I say this is not unique to Americans.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen it myself in Afghanistan</p>
<p>with British troops and so on,</p>
<p>but unless you can,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t particularly like that phrase,</p>
<p>hearts are mine,</p>
<p>unless you can make and help other nations</p>
<p>to have self-respect and to feel good about themselves,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s always going to be a really tough road ahead.</p>
<p>But one thing I do want to say,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve also tried to get into my book,</p>
<p>I do think that Americans today</p>
<p>are sometimes almost flagellatory</p>
<p>in their approach to the war.</p>
<p>Oh, God, oh, God, we were so wicked.</p>
<p>Well, although there&rsquo;s no doubt the war was a disaster,</p>
<p>a lot of Americans,</p>
<p>some of whom I&rsquo;ve interviewed for the book,</p>
<p>went to Vietnam with the highest ideals of service,</p>
<p>both some soldiers and some civilians.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been hugely moved</p>
<p>by some of the Americans I interviewed for the book.</p>
<p>They really cared.</p>
<p>Some of the civilians especially,</p>
<p>they loved the language.</p>
<p>They completely threw themselves</p>
<p>into the war-like thing.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t sort of wicked imperialists</p>
<p>who wanted to do terrible things,</p>
<p>but they were people who really wanted to do good deeds</p>
<p>in a wicked world.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of the histories of the war</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t pay sufficient tribute to some of these people.</p>
<p>I mean, one guy who made an enormous impression on me,</p>
<p>I was down on the West Coast interviewing Vietnamese,</p>
<p>and I heard about a guy called Doug Ramsey,</p>
<p>who I had never heard about,</p>
<p>but I had no idea he was still alive.</p>
<p>And I was told he was still alive</p>
<p>and living in Boulder City, Nevada.</p>
<p>And I looked at the map,</p>
<p>and it was more than 300 miles driving my EV&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>over from the West Coast to Boulder City.</p>
<p>But I just thought, I maybe ought to go and see this guy.</p>
<p>And I got in the car,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a hell of a long drive across the desert.</p>
<p>And I got to Boulder City, and there was Doug Ramsey,</p>
<p>and I spent four hours with him.</p>
<p>And it was a fascinating business,</p>
<p>because Doug Ramsey was a Foreign Service officer,</p>
<p>a really outstanding American,</p>
<p>who, in 1962, made up his mind he wanted to go</p>
<p>and serve in Vietnam,</p>
<p>and was involved in pacification programs,</p>
<p>assistant for a time to John Paul Vann,</p>
<p>the very famous American advisor out there.</p>
<p>And Doug Ramsey passionately cared about the Vietnamese.</p>
<p>He learned Vietnamese.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot of stuff,</p>
<p>but some of his letters home, which he gave me,</p>
<p>were hugely moving.</p>
<p>But then, beginning of 1966,</p>
<p>he was driving a truck with a load of rice</p>
<p>up to some village,</p>
<p>and he got ambushed by the Viet Cong and captured.</p>
<p>And he spent the next seven years,</p>
<p>not in the Hanoi Hilton,</p>
<p>but in a bamboo cage in the jungle.</p>
<p>Seven years.</p>
<p>He had malaria 123 times.</p>
<p>He had every kind of other tropical disease.</p>
<p>How he survived, God only knows.</p>
<p>And yet, he came out of this experience,</p>
<p>his health absolutely destroyed.</p>
<p>I mean, when I saw him,</p>
<p>he could hardly move his body at all,</p>
<p>but his mind was still right on.</p>
<p>And he talked so movingly,</p>
<p>because even though he&rsquo;d suffered so terribly</p>
<p>at the hands of the Communists,</p>
<p>that he was completely even-handed</p>
<p>in seeing the good stuff and the bad stuff about&hellip;</p>
<p>And he knew the Viet Cong,</p>
<p>having been their prisoner for seven years,</p>
<p>better than almost anybody else.</p>
<p>And he told me some very funny stories.</p>
<p>I mean, one of them that always stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>He said one day when he was being interviewed</p>
<p>by his interrogators,</p>
<p>and he told them that he thought</p>
<p>that the Americans were in Vietnam,</p>
<p>10% to help the Vietnamese people,</p>
<p>and 90% to hold back the Chinese and Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>And he said, the Communist interrogator replied,</p>
<p>in that case, why do you not go and fight him in China?</p>
<p>We do not like the Chinese either.</p>
<p>And another story he told, which was sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Somehow the subject of Tom Hayden came into conversation,</p>
<p>Jane Fonda&rsquo;s husband,</p>
<p>who had, of course, fallen in love with Ho Chi Minh and Co.</p>
<p>and spent half his time up in North Vietnam</p>
<p>telling the North Vietnamese how wonderful they were.</p>
<p>And when Tom Hayden&rsquo;s name was mentioned,</p>
<p>Doug Ramsey asked his interrogators,</p>
<p>he said, well, what do you think of Tom Hayden?</p>
<p>And they said, we think his ideology is excellent,</p>
<p>but as a man, we despise him.</p>
<p>How could you respect a man</p>
<p>who betrays his own country like that?</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the attitude of The Times,</p>
<p>because you just alluded to it with, as you said,</p>
<p>these soldiers who went in here for such idealistic reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, you quoted a man named Harry Williams</p>
<p>who had mentioned, you know, we were doing good,</p>
<p>we were making a real contribution,</p>
<p>we were making things better.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t. They can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It reminds me, you know, because I was sort of</p>
<p>the younger brother of that baby boom generation</p>
<p>that gets so much heat these days and so much flack,</p>
<p>and yet at the same time, it&rsquo;s hard to not notice</p>
<p>that that generation is a bunch of younger people</p>
<p>who were extremely idealistic and motivated by their idealism.</p>
<p>Some went into the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>A lot of this, as you point out, was in response</p>
<p>to John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s famous sacrifice speech.</p>
<p>But some of these people did a similar sort of approach</p>
<p>in trying to make the world a better place</p>
<p>by doing what you mentioned, parachuting, you know,</p>
<p>into Laos and trying to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail</p>
<p>so that the people in the South could&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating to, you know,</p>
<p>the word watershed moment,</p>
<p>the phrase watershed moment is overused,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to not notice the difference</p>
<p>between 1963 United States of America</p>
<p>and 1973 United States of America</p>
<p>and not attribute a large part of the disillusionment</p>
<p>and the change in attitudes to that war.</p>
<p>Does that seem&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, of course you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think two points that also&hellip;</p>
<p>To go back to your question about why I thought</p>
<p>there was a book to be written,</p>
<p>two things that&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, what I&rsquo;m always trying to do,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people make a mistake</p>
<p>when they look back at historical events</p>
<p>that they look at them through a 2018 prism.</p>
<p>And to me, the only way to write history</p>
<p>is to close your eyes and try and remember</p>
<p>how things looked to people then.</p>
<p>And the first thing to be said about the 1950s and 1960s</p>
<p>there really was a communist threat</p>
<p>that worldwide the Soviet Union and the Chinese</p>
<p>did represent deeply unpleasant totalitarian forces.</p>
<p>History, I&rsquo;m quite confident,</p>
<p>will show that the United States was absolutely right</p>
<p>to lead the Western nations in resisting.</p>
<p>We were the good guys in the Cold War,</p>
<p>and I have no doubt about that.</p>
<p>So sometimes when people say,</p>
<p>oh, well, there never really was a communist threat,</p>
<p>there most certainly was a communist threat.</p>
<p>They were very nasty people.</p>
<p>However, they did not&hellip;</p>
<p>They did get a terrible tangle in Indochina</p>
<p>because there weren&rsquo;t enough people in Washington</p>
<p>who really understood the nuances</p>
<p>and understood the nuances of nationalism.</p>
<p>And one of the things I discovered</p>
<p>in the course of researching the book,</p>
<p>which I had no idea about,</p>
<p>the Chinese and the Russians,</p>
<p>far from being enthusiastic about the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>they were doing awful business</p>
<p>because they were having to throw</p>
<p>shed loads of money and resources and weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, the Russians were giving the North Vietnamese</p>
<p>half a billion dollars a year,</p>
<p>which they could very well afford.</p>
<p>But they felt because the Chinese and the Russians</p>
<p>were competing for leadership of the socialist world,</p>
<p>they had to go on backing this war.</p>
<p>But our intelligence, Western intelligence,</p>
<p>was so bad that nobody had the inkling of this,</p>
<p>so that right through to Nixon and Kissinger,</p>
<p>all the Russians had to do was pick up the phone</p>
<p>to Hanoi,</p>
<p>and the North Vietnamese would make a deal.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all.</p>
<p>I quoted Brezhnev when he was leader of Russia,</p>
<p>saying to the Russian ambassador in Washington,</p>
<p>I have no desire to drown in the swamps of Vietnam.</p>
<p>And he felt himself almost as much a prisoner</p>
<p>of all this stuff as the Americans did.</p>
<p>He hated it, but they were all stuck in this situation.</p>
<p>And the other thing, too, which I saw the tail end of</p>
<p>when I was living here in the 60s,</p>
<p>was that America after the Second World War</p>
<p>had achieved such awesome success</p>
<p>and was so powerful and so rich</p>
<p>that it seemed to that generation of Americans</p>
<p>that nothing was impossible.</p>
<p>And no president, and this very much applied to LBJ,</p>
<p>but also to Kennedy,</p>
<p>none of them wanted to be the ones to tell the American people</p>
<p>that the full might of the United States</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t see off a load of raggedy-ass communist guerrillas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very good phrase of Kennedy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that made a great impression on me.</p>
<p>I often hear people say, and I don&rsquo;t believe it,</p>
<p>that if Kennedy had lived, he&rsquo;d have got America out of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Kennedy told J.K. Galbraith, his key economic advisor,</p>
<p>a few weeks before he was killed, he said,</p>
<p>there are only just so many concessions I can make</p>
<p>to the communists in any one year</p>
<p>and ask the American people to re-elect me.</p>
<p>And American expectations,</p>
<p>the belief among the American people</p>
<p>and certainly in American government</p>
<p>that if America wanted something, it must be doable,</p>
<p>this was very strong.</p>
<p>But of course, as you just so rightly said,</p>
<p>Vietnam went far to destroying this.</p>
<p>And one of my heroes in this book,</p>
<p>Walt Boomer, a Marine officer</p>
<p>who I spent a lot of time with and admire enormously,</p>
<p>Walt Boomer said to me, he said,</p>
<p>nothing, he said, in my lifetime</p>
<p>has changed America more than Vietnam.</p>
<p>He said it created a mistrust</p>
<p>and a suspicion of government and of the people in charge</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never been able to undo.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s right about that, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s maybe one of the most persistent things</p>
<p>in the war, the credibility gap.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to describe to Americans now</p>
<p>how, as you pointed out in your book,</p>
<p>Americans would believe their president most of the time,</p>
<p>regardless of which party he even was.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s never been the same.</p>
<p>The other thing, as you point out,</p>
<p>and as everyone knows, but it&rsquo;s not talked about enough,</p>
<p>that it changed is it sort of,</p>
<p>because it was the second major time,</p>
<p>it sort of codified the change,</p>
<p>the unspoken change in the U.S. constitutional system</p>
<p>where we no longer declared war.</p>
<p>You could describe Korea as an outlier</p>
<p>if it was once upon a time,</p>
<p>but Vietnam becomes the time where we sort of codify this.</p>
<p>And I was interested very much in how you pointed out</p>
<p>that the legal advisor to the president</p>
<p>was explaining how you could get around having to declare war.</p>
<p>I was also very interested in the Munich question.</p>
<p>It was fascinating to me how this specter of appeasement</p>
<p>and Munich was sort of hanging over</p>
<p>the decision-making process</p>
<p>and how it played into the domestic politics</p>
<p>and how it could almost be used&hellip;</p>
<p>If you compare it to a schoolyard brawl,</p>
<p>one side calling the other a coward</p>
<p>and demanding they move,</p>
<p>even if moving wasn&rsquo;t the right political choice.</p>
<p>We still have the whole Munich appeasement cudgel</p>
<p>at work in today&rsquo;s modern American politics.</p>
<p>Can you talk about that and the credibility gap a little bit?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a great fear of being seen to be weak,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the things I find as I get older,</p>
<p>and I hope that one is a different person</p>
<p>from what I was when I was a young reporter.</p>
<p>I mean, to tell you a terrible story,</p>
<p>I grew up in a household in which all the men in the house,</p>
<p>including my father, banged on and on</p>
<p>about what a wonderful time they&rsquo;d had in World War II.</p>
<p>And I grew up believing with extraordinary naivety</p>
<p>that wars were great adventures.</p>
<p>And I started out that way and I did the&hellip;</p>
<p>I parachuted with our own airborne people</p>
<p>and all the rest of it when I was 17.</p>
<p>And I really thought that this was all terrific romantic stuff.</p>
<p>And really, my whole life as a writer</p>
<p>has been a sort of journey of discovering</p>
<p>that wars are like that, that wars are very serious stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great phrase which I sometimes quote</p>
<p>to student audiences,</p>
<p>but I suppose the lesson it&rsquo;s taken me 50 years to learn</p>
<p>was quoted by a Norwegian resistance hero</p>
<p>called Knut Hansen.</p>
<p>And Knut Hansen, after doing wonderful things in World War II,</p>
<p>he wrote his memoirs in 1948.</p>
<p>And in his book he wrote,</p>
<p>although wars bring adventures that stir the heart,</p>
<p>the true nature of war</p>
<p>is composed of innumerable personal tragedies and sacrifices,</p>
<p>holy evil, and not redeemed by glory.</p>
<p>Now, I think he&rsquo;s absolutely right about that</p>
<p>and I find in my books these days,</p>
<p>I write far more about victims than I do about soldiers.</p>
<p>But I think one of the things,</p>
<p>there are many things that you do learn</p>
<p>to have a sort of respect for the dilemmas</p>
<p>facing governments.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very difficult for all governments at all times</p>
<p>to decide when to be strong and when to give way.</p>
<p>And it used to seem so easy to just send the 101st Airborne</p>
<p>or the U.S. Marine Corps to sort out your problems.</p>
<p>Well, now we know it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<p>But in the end, if you can&rsquo;t sort out the cultural issues</p>
<p>in these countries, the 101st Airborne</p>
<p>or the U.S. Marine Corps can&rsquo;t solve them for you anymore</p>
<p>than our own army can.</p>
<p>But I think if one looks at history,</p>
<p>one can see moments.</p>
<p>I mean, we all see now that Kennedy was both courageous</p>
<p>and bold at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis,</p>
<p>which could have gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p>But sometimes when presidents&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, Lyndon Johnson terribly wanted to be seen</p>
<p>to be courageous and to be doing the right thing</p>
<p>as the leader of the United States</p>
<p>by sending in troops to Vietnam.</p>
<p>But, of course, he got it wrong.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;d like to feel is that through my own narratives,</p>
<p>one is all the time trying to realize</p>
<p>that governments are trying to do very difficult things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean the United States government</p>
<p>in the context of Vietnam,</p>
<p>but most governments most of the time</p>
<p>and the same way for military commanders.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen enough wars myself as a reporter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough terrible things on the battlefield.</p>
<p>But it is very difficult to fight wars.</p>
<p>It is not, as my father and his friends used to say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s all a great romp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tough out there on the battlefield.</p>
<p>And I find that at the age of 72,</p>
<p>I have a huge sympathy with the people</p>
<p>who make the decisions that I didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>when I was a stupid young kid.</p>
<p>I was interested when you had pointed out</p>
<p>that everyone involved in the decision-making process</p>
<p>of moving from a more passive advisor role</p>
<p>to putting troops on the ground,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to quote you here.</p>
<p>You wrote, quote,</p>
<p>none doubted that the war would be long and the cost immense,</p>
<p>quite unlike, for instance,</p>
<p>the 2002 decision to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>In 1965, every hazard was anticipated.</p>
<p>I not only found that an interesting line,</p>
<p>I found that to be a new piece of information for me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read quite a few books on Vietnam,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>And that was something that I think</p>
<p>changed my paradigm a little.</p>
<p>Can you explain that?</p>
<p>Because it is interesting to think</p>
<p>you would commit eventually half a million troops</p>
<p>and yet understand how it might not even be winnable</p>
<p>and understand how tough it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>and not understand, as you said,</p>
<p>the difference between Asian communism</p>
<p>and Soviet communism.</p>
<p>Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>Well, if you find, I mean,</p>
<p>the hugely impressive figure in the Johnson,</p>
<p>not in the Johnson White House,</p>
<p>but the Secretary of State, George Ball,</p>
<p>his memoranda and the things he said</p>
<p>in conversations at the White House</p>
<p>with the President, he warned all along,</p>
<p>as indeed did some of the generals,</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t think that a jungle war</p>
<p>in the swamps on the mountains of Vietnam</p>
<p>was going to be the kind that suited the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>And one of the problems, I&rsquo;m afraid,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all very prone to,</p>
<p>is that we can be terribly impressed</p>
<p>by how mighty our own forces look.</p>
<p>That if you see a U.S. carrier group at sea</p>
<p>and if you see all these terrific jets</p>
<p>taking off from the flight decks</p>
<p>and if you see your Marines storming through the surf</p>
<p>and so on, they all look so impressive</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t believe anything can stand up to them.</p>
<p>But there were people, smart people,</p>
<p>in positions of influence in the 60s</p>
<p>who did clearly identify the fact</p>
<p>that this was going to be very tough</p>
<p>and that that kind of war in the jungle</p>
<p>against guerrillas might well not suit Americans.</p>
<p>And part of it, one of the things</p>
<p>a lot of people, George Ball said very smartly,</p>
<p>he said, Mr. President,</p>
<p>if I thought this could be done in a year,</p>
<p>he said, I would back you all the way.</p>
<p>But he said, I think it&rsquo;s going to take much longer</p>
<p>and I do not believe that the American people</p>
<p>will have the patience for a long war.</p>
<p>And one of the key things is,</p>
<p>democracies like wars to be over quick.</p>
<p>And I always say, I mean,</p>
<p>it sort of half amuses me</p>
<p>that the last job I did as a war correspondent,</p>
<p>I reported the British-Falklands War in 1982.</p>
<p>And the British loved the Falklands War</p>
<p>because we had an incredibly incompetent enemy</p>
<p>in the Argentine army.</p>
<p>And it was all over very quickly and we won.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sort of war everybody wants.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not the kind of war you would get.</p>
<p>But, no, I am impressed by the number of smart people,</p>
<p>some of them in uniform, who clearly saw.</p>
<p>But one of the problems facing chiefs of staff,</p>
<p>and that was true now and then,</p>
<p>if your political leader, your president</p>
<p>or your prime minister says, can you do this?</p>
<p>Well, senior generals and admirals and airmen,</p>
<p>they know they&rsquo;ve got to justify</p>
<p>the stupendous cost of the armed forces.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to be quite a brave man</p>
<p>to tell your head of state or your chief executive</p>
<p>that your forces can&rsquo;t do this or that.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember being amused in 2002,</p>
<p>just before the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>And I was friendly with our then head of the army.</p>
<p>And I met him one day when he&rsquo;d just come back</p>
<p>from Washington where he&rsquo;d been at a planning meeting</p>
<p>for the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>And I said, well, what do you make of it?</p>
<p>And he said, well, he said, getting to Baghdad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be dead easy.</p>
<p>But he said they haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to do when they get there.</p>
<p>But at that time, that to the people</p>
<p>making the decisions in Washington</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t seem too much of a problem.</p>
<p>But there were smart people back in 64, 65</p>
<p>who did see that this was going to be</p>
<p>a very tough road to hoe.</p>
<p>But the people, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, again,</p>
<p>one was always mixed up between horror</p>
<p>at some of the stupid people who did bad things,</p>
<p>both in uniform and out of it.</p>
<p>And also admiration, again.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the soldiers and some of the Marines</p>
<p>and some of the airmen and so on,</p>
<p>within the framework of a disaster,</p>
<p>they did very fine things.</p>
<p>And I find myself still admiring hugely what they achieved.</p>
<p>And all right, you may say you&rsquo;re going to be a cynic.</p>
<p>You say, well, it was all for nothing.</p>
<p>But mind you, I have to say one story that</p>
<p>sticks very much in my mind.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive people I interviewed</p>
<p>was a former corpsman, a medic with the infantry,</p>
<p>a guy called David Rogers.</p>
<p>And David Rogers described to me very movingly</p>
<p>his experiences with his platoon,</p>
<p>of whom he said about a third were killed or wounded</p>
<p>up north of Saigon in about 69, 70.</p>
<p>And he said, I mean, he was very emotionally affected</p>
<p>by the war and remains so.</p>
<p>But he said, in 1993, he was one of those</p>
<p>who the Vietnamese invited back as a guest</p>
<p>to come and visit the country again.</p>
<p>And he went as a reporter.</p>
<p>And he said they took him to the area</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;d fought with his unit.</p>
<p>And he said all the Viet Cong embraced him</p>
<p>because they were all under strict orders</p>
<p>to be incredibly nice to Americans</p>
<p>because they wanted Congress to pass a trade deal.</p>
<p>And David Rogers said to me, when I interviewed him</p>
<p>a couple of years ago, he said, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking</p>
<p>if all these guys, what if it was the McDonald&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t we have sorted this out a long time ago?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said, Johnson was offering a billion dollar dam</p>
<p>if they would just stop infiltrating the South.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something that&rsquo;s a little close to home, maybe.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the media coverage</p>
<p>because this was proverbially the war that was lost</p>
<p>in America&rsquo;s living rooms and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I found some of the things you said very interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, you brought up a point</p>
<p>that had never occurred to me.</p>
<p>Quoting here, I think, or close to it,</p>
<p>that Vietnam War era reporters enjoyed a notable advantage</p>
<p>over most of their successors in the 21st century</p>
<p>because they themselves had often served in uniform</p>
<p>and were familiar with weapons and military ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And the other thing that I found interesting</p>
<p>was when you talked about the line</p>
<p>that some Americans went to their graves</p>
<p>believing that reporters betrayed their country</p>
<p>while winning plaudits from the media counterparts</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about media coverage?</p>
<p>I mean, for example, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>because before that war, the war coverage</p>
<p>was very censored, World War II type stuff,</p>
<p>and yet somehow after that war, they&rsquo;ve toned down.</p>
<p>I mean, now we have embedded reporters</p>
<p>who are essentially working with the governments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever seen the kind of freedom</p>
<p>to show news the way they did in that war.</p>
<p>And do you think that was a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>And do you think the reporters at the time</p>
<p>did a good enough job pointing out what you mentioned,</p>
<p>the other side&rsquo;s transgressions and atrocities and everything</p>
<p>so that things would be equal a little bit?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve said in the introduction to my book</p>
<p>that I think that many of the reporters who served in Vietnam</p>
<p>did an outstanding job of reporting entirely accurately</p>
<p>what they themselves saw and knew.</p>
<p>But where they failed was because there was so much going on</p>
<p>on the other side that they had no access to.</p>
<p>But all the incredibly bad stuff</p>
<p>that the other side was doing never got any sort of show.</p>
<p>And I quite understand in a very small way</p>
<p>I was partly to it myself because, you know,</p>
<p>when I was reporting there for BBC and newspapers</p>
<p>in the early 70s, and all the time you were seeing</p>
<p>shocking stuff going on all around you,</p>
<p>and you were witness to the corruption</p>
<p>and the incompetence of the South Vietnamese government,</p>
<p>but we just didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to stuff we couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And the United States, whereas it was absolutely true</p>
<p>that there was a huge credibility gap</p>
<p>because a lot of the stuff that we were told at briefings</p>
<p>and so on was absolute garbage,</p>
<p>that the numbers, all this stuff about body counts and so on,</p>
<p>the frightful lies were told.</p>
<p>In fact, Walt Boomer, the General Marine Corps General,</p>
<p>he said to me that one of the lessons he brought home</p>
<p>from three tours in Vietnam was tell the truth.</p>
<p>But the curious thing, the sort of contradiction,</p>
<p>that on the one hand, a lot of senior Americans</p>
<p>did not tell the truth to the world,</p>
<p>about what was happening, but on the other hand,</p>
<p>America did preserve a commitment</p>
<p>that was very honorable to let us see for ourselves,</p>
<p>so that in a way that&rsquo;s never been repeated</p>
<p>in any war since, that if any of us sort of didn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>what we were being told about some battle</p>
<p>going off in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>we could get access, and me as a British journalist</p>
<p>as much as anybody, on fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters</p>
<p>to go up there and look for ourselves.</p>
<p>And the communists would never let anybody but Jane Fonda</p>
<p>go up and see what the hell was going on</p>
<p>in their neck of the woods.</p>
<p>And I do not believe that the business,</p>
<p>that the media lost the war,</p>
<p>but I certainly do believe that the way</p>
<p>that the war was covered made it more difficult</p>
<p>for the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, my father was a war correspondent in World War II,</p>
<p>and I once said to him that, having been reading</p>
<p>some of his wartime dispatches,</p>
<p>they seemed to be pretty gung-ho.</p>
<p>And he said what we were doing was part of the war effort.</p>
<p>Now, of course, nearly all the senior officers</p>
<p>who were in Vietnam, American senior officers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d been in World War II,</p>
<p>and they were accustomed to dealing with a media</p>
<p>that would play the game</p>
<p>in what would seem to be the national interest.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t break ranks.</p>
<p>And now, suddenly, in Vietnam, they find that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a whole lot of reporters</p>
<p>who refuse to accept that telling the story</p>
<p>the way that Mac V, as they&rsquo;ve always known,</p>
<p>wanted it told was not going to happen.</p>
<p>And they found it very difficult to adjust to this.</p>
<p>And I think what is also fair,</p>
<p>but some journalists, I think, are a bit dishonest about,</p>
<p>I mean, I was taking part in a television discussion</p>
<p>a year or so ago with a group of former war correspondents,</p>
<p>including some Americans.</p>
<p>And I said they were talking about their commitment</p>
<p>to tell the truth and tell the world what was going on.</p>
<p>And I said, shouldn&rsquo;t we also admit</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re as young as we all were and so on,</p>
<p>it was a great adventure, and we had the time of our lives.</p>
<p>In many ways, we were all responsible kids.</p>
<p>Well, none of the others would admit that at all.</p>
<p>In fact, they got very angry with me for saying that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m afraid there were, in Vietnam,</p>
<p>quite a lot of the journalists were, frankly,</p>
<p>what I would call war tourists.</p>
<p>There were some brilliantly serious-minded</p>
<p>superb people like Neil Sian and David Halberstam and so on.</p>
<p>So there were some very fine correspondents.</p>
<p>But, I mean, it was a great life.</p>
<p>There were unlimited girls, drugs, delicious food,</p>
<p>beautiful country, and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>And although some of the media had their finest hour in Vietnam,</p>
<p>I would also say that some of the media had their unfinest hour,</p>
<p>like the television crew that provided a knife for a soldier</p>
<p>to cut the ears off some dead Viet Cong on camera.</p>
<p>That sort of stuff.</p>
<p>So the media&rsquo;s record in Vietnam was pretty mixed.</p>
<p>And there was some stuff to be proud of</p>
<p>and some stuff, frankly, to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk, because I know time is short,</p>
<p>a little bit about the anti-war reaction</p>
<p>in terms of protests and everything else.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>As a kid growing up in the post-Vietnam era,</p>
<p>I just thought that was the new reality</p>
<p>that would be expected in future conflicts.</p>
<p>And yet now, looking 50 years back on things,</p>
<p>really, if you start in the Second World War,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little of that large spike in anti-war activity.</p>
<p>I mean, not only were there no protesters protesting</p>
<p>the bombing of Germany and Japan,</p>
<p>but there really, by 1960s standards,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t that much after the Vietnam War</p>
<p>for any of the conflicts.</p>
<p>What do you think accounts for that</p>
<p>being such an outlier situation?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve suggested in my book,</p>
<p>I mean, remember, I was living here in the late 60s,</p>
<p>so I saw it all first hand.</p>
<p>I saw the demonstrations and the whole thing.</p>
<p>But all sorts of stuff got tangled up together.</p>
<p>It was the worldwide youth movement</p>
<p>against the established order</p>
<p>and the revolt against the old sexual morality</p>
<p>and the enthusiasm of POT and LSD.</p>
<p>And all this stuff got rolled up with Vietnam.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to remember, kids in those days</p>
<p>were putting posters on their college walls of Mao Tse Tung,</p>
<p>who, anybody who knows anything,</p>
<p>knows he was one of the great mass murderers</p>
<p>of the 20th century up there with Hitler.</p>
<p>So there was incredible naivety among the kids.</p>
<p>The kids were right about one thing,</p>
<p>the war was a disaster.</p>
<p>But of course, one of the things</p>
<p>that drove the protest movement</p>
<p>was the fact that a lot of them</p>
<p>were terrified of being drafted,</p>
<p>that they were afraid they were going to have to waste</p>
<p>two years of their lives in uniform</p>
<p>and maybe lose their lives altogether.</p>
<p>So mixed up with their principal objections to the war</p>
<p>and mixed up with the whole youth revolt</p>
<p>was they felt they had skin in the game</p>
<p>about the danger to themselves.</p>
<p>And they were, I mean, it was an extraordinary time to be here.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the stuff that I saw myself was,</p>
<p>you actually felt America was falling apart in 1968.</p>
<p>And in fact, the fact it didn&rsquo;t fall apart,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never gone to a bearer of America ever since.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s always, I always believe passionately</p>
<p>to this day in America&rsquo;s capacity of reinvention</p>
<p>because I saw what a mess it could get itself into in 68</p>
<p>and come out the other side.</p>
<p>But no subsequent war, the other thing we must remember,</p>
<p>the whole thing was much smaller.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve hardly talked too much in this conversation</p>
<p>about all the battlefield stuff.</p>
<p>And if you look at casualties,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve written about one battle</p>
<p>in one chapter of my book called Dido</p>
<p>that absolutely nobody&rsquo;s ever heard of.</p>
<p>And this was a three-day battle in May 1968</p>
<p>in which a Marine battalion was more or less wiped out</p>
<p>up near the demilitarized zone.</p>
<p>In three days of battle in which they lost 81 killed,</p>
<p>and I forget, about 250 wounded.</p>
<p>And they ended up with one unwounded officer</p>
<p>and about 150 men still fit for combat.</p>
<p>And nothing remotely like that happened in Iraq or in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I mean, the scale, this was a really murderous, bloody business.</p>
<p>And some of the stuff people did</p>
<p>and some of the stuff people experienced,</p>
<p>I mean, it was as bad as World War II or Korea at times.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t buy the line</p>
<p>that Vietnam was the worst war there ever was.</p>
<p>I mean, all wars are pretty ghastly.</p>
<p>But it was a hell of a lot worse in the scale of the bloodbath</p>
<p>than anything remotely in Afghanistan or Iraq.</p>
<p>And these are volunteer, they&rsquo;ve been fought by volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>Well, you remember very well that they used to publish photos in Time</p>
<p>or Life magazine of everyone killed that week.</p>
<p>And sometimes the casualty levels could get high enough,</p>
<p>hundreds a week, that I would see&hellip;</p>
<p>300 a week in 68.</p>
<p>And I was trying to figure out how we would react today</p>
<p>in the United States to casualty numbers.</p>
<p>Well, and so that brings me back to something.</p>
<p>You had talked about the war being a disaster.</p>
<p>And then we had talked about the protesters and the media and everything.</p>
<p>It does make me wonder, though, what is the responsibility</p>
<p>if your government seems on a course to continue doubling down</p>
<p>on something that everyone knows is a disaster?</p>
<p>In a Democratic or Republican system,</p>
<p>what is the role of the population in terms of checking a government</p>
<p>that, as you said, didn&rsquo;t know what they were getting into</p>
<p>or did know what they were getting into,</p>
<p>but found no way out of where they were going?</p>
<p>I mean, could one make the case that it was better</p>
<p>to have that kind of pressure on the part of the electorate</p>
<p>versus what might have happened if that pressure had not been there?</p>
<p>When I was living there in the United States in the late 60s,</p>
<p>I could see a lot of Americans, especially in middle America,</p>
<p>and I got to know middle America very well in that era.</p>
<p>And I spent a lot of time in places like Minnesota and Wisconsin and so on.</p>
<p>And you saw very patriotic Americans wrestling with the dilemma</p>
<p>of where loyalty lay.</p>
<p>Did you just blindly go on supporting your president</p>
<p>or did you not&hellip;</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t the kind to go out and protest in the streets,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very difficult issue.</p>
<p>And I think it is right to speak out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never easy to decide where the patriotic root lies.</p>
<p>And I remember one of the most moving things that happened to me</p>
<p>when I was there in 71,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d been up reporting for BBC about a place called Farbase 6</p>
<p>up near the Laos border, a hell of a murderous business.</p>
<p>And we hitched a ride back to Saigon on a C-130</p>
<p>that was only one of the camera crew on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the cargo hold of this huge aircraft.</p>
<p>And down at the end of the plane, the opposite end from us,</p>
<p>was the body bag containing an American sergeant and advisor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been killed in the battle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s his body bag with all his stuff around him,</p>
<p>his guitar and his sound system and all his kit and so on.</p>
<p>And we had an hour and a half or two hours on the plane down to Saigon</p>
<p>looking, I was sort of looking at this, at that poor bastard</p>
<p>and his body bag and so on.</p>
<p>And I thought, we&rsquo;re now in a situation where nobody wants to be</p>
<p>the last American to die in a war that&rsquo;s obviously lost.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things that one does bitterly reproach</p>
<p>Nixon and Kissinger for, from the moment they assumed office in 69,</p>
<p>they knew there was no hope of winning the war.</p>
<p>But they were desperate for purely political reasons</p>
<p>to conceal from the American people the fact the war was lost.</p>
<p>And 22,000 Americans died under the Nixon presidency,</p>
<p>and countless Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And it was, in many ways, the worst period</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got the whole black power thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the army in Vietnam falling apart,</p>
<p>the huge drug problems and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And all this, they knew all the way down the street</p>
<p>that there was no way they were going to win this.</p>
<p>But they were just desperate to avoid anybody finding out about this.</p>
<p>And to me, one of the grisliest bits, the White House tapes</p>
<p>that were relatively recently released in 2015,</p>
<p>is of Kissinger coming back from the secret Paris peace talks in October 72.</p>
<p>And he rushes into the Oval Office and he says to Nixon,</p>
<p>he says, Mr. President, we have got a better deal than you have ever dreamed of.</p>
<p>And remember, this is a month before Nixon faces George McGovern</p>
<p>in the presidential election.</p>
<p>And Kissinger doesn&rsquo;t say, this is going to bring peace,</p>
<p>this is going to save countless lives.</p>
<p>He said, this will absolutely, totally screw McGovern.</p>
<p>And the cynicism of these guys at this stage.</p>
<p>And it was all about politics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a pretty, it&rsquo;s hard, it sticks in your craw, you know.</p>
<p>But actually, one thing I would say, which I think is important,</p>
<p>as a sort of closing note on this, to me, the supreme irony of the war.</p>
<p>If you go to Vietnam today, if you said to an American at about 66,</p>
<p>how would you like Saigon to look in 2018?</p>
<p>Well, actually, it would be pretty much the way it looks now.</p>
<p>And although it&rsquo;s still a very unpleasant totalitarian state, Vietnam,</p>
<p>they do now have license to make money.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be Americans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredibly nice to Americans because they realize</p>
<p>that the American system is worth, is countless more valuable</p>
<p>and countless more valid than their own wretched government.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all completely hooked on American culture and on making money.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve suggested in the last chapter of my book</p>
<p>that while the United States failed in Vietnam with B-52s</p>
<p>and spooky gunships and defoliation, that the United States triumphed</p>
<p>with Johnny Depp and YouTube.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve learned is that economic forces can be at least as important,</p>
<p>if not more so, than soldiers in deciding how history plays out.</p>
<p>My stepfather always said, just drop blue jeans, rock and roll,</p>
<p>and Playboy magazine on them, and they&rsquo;ll become Americans.</p>
<p>You said it. That&rsquo;s the way.</p>
<p>Sir Max, we&rsquo;ve hardly touched upon all the good things in this book, though,</p>
<p>and I would like to encourage anyone who would love to get an updated,</p>
<p>really interesting view of Vietnam from somebody who wasn&rsquo;t just there,</p>
<p>but has had a chance to think and talk and do research about it ever since,</p>
<p>Sir Max Hastings, and the book is Vietnam.</p>
