<p>on mondays okay</p>
<p>casey anthony</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s all sorts of</p>
<p>casey anthony</p>
<p>well she was born</p>
<p>march sixteenth nineteen eighty six</p>
<p>she was born in warren ohio she was one of two children</p>
<p>to her parents cindy and george anthony</p>
<p>now casey was said to be very energetic</p>
<p>okay and very intelligent from a young age</p>
<p>at some point her family moved down to</p>
<p>orlando florida which is you know home of the</p>
<p>home of the disney worlds but they have disney</p>
<p>world seaworld universal studios</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s father he</p>
<p>worked as a cop</p>
<p>and her mother worked as a home care</p>
<p>nurse and she had a brother named lee</p>
<p>who was four years older</p>
<p>or is four years older</p>
<p>as casey got into her</p>
<p>teenage years it was said by friends and family</p>
<p>that she had a weird pattern of lying</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t say weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just some people do that and we don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>but she had a pattern of</p>
<p>lying okay she would lie</p>
<p>about just the smallest</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>things just</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t even matter</p>
<p>her parents would be like hey</p>
<p>did you eat the leftovers in the fridge and she&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like no i didn&rsquo;t eat the leftovers and they&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>well then what</p>
<p>about all those</p>
<p>crumbs around your</p>
<p>mouth and she&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she was one of</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s lying</p>
<p>about weird</p>
<p>things in high</p>
<p>school it was said that casey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when she really</p>
<p>started to completely push away from her family</p>
<p>casey was once like</p>
<p>the little girl who told her mom and dad everything</p>
<p>and then she became a</p>
<p>teenager in high</p>
<p>school and that&rsquo;s when she just</p>
<p>completely cut everybody off</p>
<p>she wanted nothing to do with her family</p>
<p>and even though she</p>
<p>still lived at home</p>
<p>her family really didn&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about her so</p>
<p>casey became that friend</p>
<p>or that person who always</p>
<p>had to have a boyfriend or just be in a relationship</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>being single or just on her own or</p>
<p>maybe she just didn&rsquo;t know how to be without a partner</p>
<p>but she always</p>
<p>she always had someone</p>
<p>later on when her parents</p>
<p>would think back to casey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high school</p>
<p>age they really had no idea who</p>
<p>casey hung out with her friends</p>
<p>who she was dating i mean nothing</p>
<p>they tried to be involved but</p>
<p>casey made it impossible</p>
<p>for them to be</p>
<p>involved cause she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t tell them anything</p>
<p>right casey</p>
<p>would go out with her friends she</p>
<p>would party all</p>
<p>night and she just went through what one</p>
<p>would call a wild</p>
<p>stage you know</p>
<p>the adolescent years</p>
<p>casey was about to</p>
<p>graduate high</p>
<p>school and her parents they want to celebrate</p>
<p>their daughter&rsquo;s graduation</p>
<p>so they made some cards and they invited like a</p>
<p>bunch of people over to have a little</p>
<p>party for casey but</p>
<p>literally the day before her graduation</p>
<p>her parents were like</p>
<p>hey you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with your</p>
<p>graduation where is it at what time is it at they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to find information so they can attend</p>
<p>her graduation right</p>
<p>so they call up the</p>
<p>school because</p>
<p>casey wasn&rsquo;t giving them any straight answers</p>
<p>so they call up the</p>
<p>school and they&rsquo;re informed that</p>
<p>casey wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be able to graduate</p>
<p>that she was failing most of her</p>
<p>classes the parents</p>
<p>her parents they</p>
<p>literally had no idea</p>
<p>they had no idea</p>
<p>that this was</p>
<p>going on okay</p>
<p>you know okay all right</p>
<p>so instead of trying to finish high school</p>
<p>casey ended up</p>
<p>dropping out of high</p>
<p>school and soon</p>
<p>after she got a job working at universal studios</p>
<p>in the hard rock cafe</p>
<p>now after work she</p>
<p>would come home and she</p>
<p>would talk to her parents</p>
<p>about her co workers and</p>
<p>how her work day was but overall</p>
<p>she seemed really happy</p>
<p>and she seemed to really</p>
<p>enjoy her job</p>
<p>in january of 2005</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>casey met and fell in love with her boyfriend</p>
<p>jesse grund</p>
<p>now it just kind of seemed like</p>
<p>things were just really good for casey</p>
<p>she enjoyed her job she had this new boo</p>
<p>thing that she really liked</p>
<p>you know things were just looking up</p>
<p>later that year again</p>
<p>still two thousand five</p>
<p>casey is nineteen years old and she becomes pregnant</p>
<p>so she finds out she&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s telling her friend that she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna keep the baby but she wants to</p>
<p>maybe give it up for adoption</p>
<p>um so she can continue her lifestyle and not have to</p>
<p>worry about a kid but</p>
<p>months went by</p>
<p>casey still living at home</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t like tell her parents</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>carrying the baby and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until she was seven</p>
<p>months pregnant</p>
<p>that casey finally told her parents that she</p>
<p>was seven months pregnant</p>
<p>now casey&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>petite she&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very petite</p>
<p>okay casey said that she was wearing</p>
<p>baggy clothes</p>
<p>loose fitting</p>
<p>clothes she&rsquo;s a petite girl so it was like</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t showing too much but i</p>
<p>think at the seven</p>
<p>months mark it was like okay she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hide it anymore so she had to tell her parents</p>
<p>she tells them and she was telling them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about placing the baby up for adoption</p>
<p>but her parents were like heck no you are not</p>
<p>putting your kid up for adoption they were just</p>
<p>completely outraged</p>
<p>that she would even</p>
<p>think about doing this</p>
<p>they forbade</p>
<p>her from giving the baby up</p>
<p>so august ninth</p>
<p>two thousand five</p>
<p>casey anthony gave</p>
<p>birth to her little baby</p>
<p>daughter kaylee</p>
<p>marie anthony</p>
<p>casey she said that</p>
<p>her boyfriend</p>
<p>jesse was kaylee&rsquo;s father and she said this pretty</p>
<p>early on but</p>
<p>who the baby&rsquo;s father was or</p>
<p>is it was still a mystery</p>
<p>nobody really knew who the father was</p>
<p>there were many theories out there as to who the father</p>
<p>could be but cindy and george they</p>
<p>never pressed</p>
<p>casey to find out who the father was</p>
<p>casey at one</p>
<p>point told her</p>
<p>mother that</p>
<p>kaylee&rsquo;s father was in a terrible car accident and died</p>
<p>it just seemed like you</p>
<p>could never get a straight answer from her</p>
<p>um her stories flip flop and change</p>
<p>often i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it really matters who the father was but</p>
<p>just the fact that she lied i</p>
<p>think a lot of people kind of like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what they were doing i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this girl&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t trust anything out of her damn</p>
<p>mouth now for</p>
<p>some reason the family thought it was best to keep</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s pregnancy a</p>
<p>secret which</p>
<p>is totally fine like you don&rsquo;t have to tell anyone</p>
<p>but for some reason</p>
<p>they decided not to tell</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s older brother lee that she was pregnant and</p>
<p>expecting a baby</p>
<p>until a couple of days before</p>
<p>she gave birth</p>
<p>and then when they finally did tell him he</p>
<p>was very upset he was very</p>
<p>angry with the family</p>
<p>and he decided not to even go to the hospital</p>
<p>when she did give</p>
<p>birth cause he was just so</p>
<p>so lee her brother he was also living at home</p>
<p>so why they didn&rsquo;t tell him i don&rsquo;t know and this</p>
<p>whole thing just</p>
<p>caused like a</p>
<p>major riff in the family</p>
<p>like why would you keep this major</p>
<p>secret for me</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s my sister</p>
<p>they seemed somewhat</p>
<p>close her and her brother</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>thought process behind that couldn&rsquo;t figure out why</p>
<p>choices were made</p>
<p>so on new year&rsquo;s eve jesse</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s boyfriend and alleged baby&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>asked for her hand in marriage</p>
<p>saying that he wanted</p>
<p>all of them the</p>
<p>whole family to just be together</p>
<p>and be a unit be a family</p>
<p>casey was excited</p>
<p>she loved him but i think</p>
<p>this is just an observation and an opinion but i</p>
<p>think deep down she knew that he wasn&rsquo;t the father</p>
<p>and she was probably feeling some sort of way</p>
<p>so casey has her</p>
<p>daughter she&rsquo;s newly</p>
<p>engaged and around this time</p>
<p>casey enlisted the help of a</p>
<p>nanny named</p>
<p>zany or zenata</p>
<p>fernandez gonzalez</p>
<p>but she called her zany</p>
<p>so she says</p>
<p>when casey&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>asked her like hey how did you find this zany</p>
<p>lady what a</p>
<p>wacky name zany hmm</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>but i would</p>
<p>say that they said okay how did you find this zany</p>
<p>and casey told them that it was an it</p>
<p>tech who worked over at universal</p>
<p>studios named jeff</p>
<p>who introduced her to his ex</p>
<p>girlfriend zany</p>
<p>and he paid her to watch both</p>
<p>his son and kaylee</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like okay that guy&rsquo;s paying for her to</p>
<p>watch your kid okay</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re just okay</p>
<p>which to me</p>
<p>would be a red flag because it&rsquo;s like who do you know</p>
<p>who would pay for your child care</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s not normal</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t have a kid i don&rsquo;t know i just know</p>
<p>childcare is expensive</p>
<p>anyway cindy recalled kaylee talking about zany</p>
<p>and her dog but they</p>
<p>like no one besides</p>
<p>casey had ever seen or met</p>
<p>zany in the family</p>
<p>you wanna talk</p>
<p>about suspicion</p>
<p>okay so a dna test was done to determine if</p>
<p>jesse really was the father of kaylee</p>
<p>and the lie detector test determined</p>
<p>jesse was not the father</p>
<p>devastating news to jesse who</p>
<p>still wanted to work it out</p>
<p>but in may of 2006</p>
<p>jesse broke off</p>
<p>their engagement</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s behavior was</p>
<p>becoming more erratic</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>becoming a different person</p>
<p>so they broke up and a little bit of times goes on and</p>
<p>casey is just</p>
<p>ready to start dating</p>
<p>again so she</p>
<p>starts she starts</p>
<p>going out there she&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go out and just</p>
<p>thinking i just want</p>
<p>dance so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going out and</p>
<p>partying a lot with her friends</p>
<p>now while she&rsquo;s out that&rsquo;s when she meets this guy</p>
<p>named tony who was</p>
<p>an aspiring dj</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna work out real well</p>
<p>so the two are dating and</p>
<p>casey would</p>
<p>bring kaylee over</p>
<p>to his apartment</p>
<p>that he shared with his roommates</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>spend a lot of</p>
<p>their time there casey was</p>
<p>still living at home during this time with her parents</p>
<p>and casey&rsquo;s parents they helped take care of kaylee</p>
<p>they gave her own room they fed her they</p>
<p>clothed her</p>
<p>they pretty much took care of</p>
<p>kaylee as as much as they could</p>
<p>so according to</p>
<p>casey on june fifteenth</p>
<p>two thousand eight</p>
<p>there was a heated argument happening within the family</p>
<p>the next morning</p>
<p>casey left with kaylee</p>
<p>for a work trip to tampa florida</p>
<p>she was angry</p>
<p>and she did not</p>
<p>wanna come back</p>
<p>home so she packed like a bag as if she were</p>
<p>going to stay for a</p>
<p>while the one</p>
<p>thing we know for sure</p>
<p>is on june 16</p>
<p>2008 that was the last day that kaylee was seen</p>
<p>alive so casey had told her family that she was</p>
<p>going to be gone for a work related</p>
<p>trip to tampa</p>
<p>right okay so</p>
<p>what really was</p>
<p>going on was that</p>
<p>casey she ended up leaving with kaylee right</p>
<p>she headed over to her boyfriend&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>but when she got there</p>
<p>kaylee wasn&rsquo;t with her</p>
<p>when asked where kaylee was she always had an excuse</p>
<p>she was either with the nanny</p>
<p>or she was just</p>
<p>somewhere else she was always somewhere else</p>
<p>haley so casey</p>
<p>would end up staying at her boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house for a month</p>
<p>a month and</p>
<p>every time she</p>
<p>spoke with her mom</p>
<p>cause her mom</p>
<p>would call her up be like</p>
<p>hey you know</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s it going</p>
<p>how is kaylee doing</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s kaylee can i talk to kaylee</p>
<p>every time her mom</p>
<p>would ask casey</p>
<p>would have a different</p>
<p>excuse like oh</p>
<p>kelly&rsquo;s with the nanny zany</p>
<p>or kaylee sleeping</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s taking a nap and her</p>
<p>grandparents</p>
<p>they were getting more and more concerned like</p>
<p>i have it&rsquo;s been a month</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s kaylee</p>
<p>during this</p>
<p>month vacation i guess</p>
<p>casey began</p>
<p>partying more than ever</p>
<p>she participated in a sexy body contest</p>
<p>at a local club</p>
<p>and she was out</p>
<p>drinking with her friends</p>
<p>what seemed almost</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>again her boyfriend the guy that</p>
<p>she was saying he was a dj so wherever he was at that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where she was going</p>
<p>so at this time myspace was very popular so she</p>
<p>would be posting</p>
<p>pictures of her out</p>
<p>partying dancing on bar tops</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just like yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>she probably was doing</p>
<p>and then she also got a</p>
<p>tattoo that said bella vita</p>
<p>which means beautiful</p>
<p>life you know she was doing well like most people do in</p>
<p>their early 20s</p>
<p>but where was kaylee</p>
<p>so casey&rsquo;s parents they gave her</p>
<p>their car for her to use</p>
<p>cause she didn&rsquo;t have one</p>
<p>so she was driving this car around</p>
<p>using it for</p>
<p>quote unquote</p>
<p>work related</p>
<p>stuff and to make sure that casey had</p>
<p>transportation</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re just trying to take care of</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>so they let her borrow</p>
<p>the car so one day</p>
<p>casey drives down to a</p>
<p>check cashing</p>
<p>place and at this time</p>
<p>she literally made it there</p>
<p>on empty empty empty</p>
<p>she was running on</p>
<p>fumes right</p>
<p>so she gets there and she runs out of gas</p>
<p>but she cashes her check</p>
<p>like this is all the</p>
<p>money that she has</p>
<p>and she realizes like oh my gosh getting the car towed</p>
<p>to a gas station is</p>
<p>gonna cost me my</p>
<p>whole check</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>so instead she decides to just abandon</p>
<p>the car in the parking lot she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t realize how much her parents are helping her</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;s just like slapping them in the face like</p>
<p>you know anyways so she decides that&rsquo;s her best option</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>leave the car here</p>
<p>so she does that</p>
<p>so some time passes and people</p>
<p>working in the</p>
<p>check cashing</p>
<p>place realizes</p>
<p>like this car has been in the parking lot forever</p>
<p>you know we have to call</p>
<p>the tow truck can get it removed</p>
<p>so they do that</p>
<p>they get the car</p>
<p>towed out of there</p>
<p>right and it goes to the pound</p>
<p>where they call up george</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>and they say hey you know we have your carts and</p>
<p>pounded this is the</p>
<p>vehicle and this is</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>george for good reason is like</p>
<p>what the heck why is</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s car there</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>okay so jorst</p>
<p>goes down to pick</p>
<p>up the car and figure out what the heck is going on</p>
<p>right he gets to the pound</p>
<p>he pays the</p>
<p>money to get the car out</p>
<p>and then the guy who&rsquo;s working at the</p>
<p>pound takes him out to the car</p>
<p>so the two of them are</p>
<p>going out there together he gives him the keys</p>
<p>george says that he opens up the car door</p>
<p>and he says that both of them got a whiff of a pungent</p>
<p>smell just coming from the car</p>
<p>and the worker</p>
<p>said that it</p>
<p>smelled like a dead body</p>
<p>now i personally have</p>
<p>never smelled a dead body before</p>
<p>which i think is probably</p>
<p>yeah as a blessing but</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve read and researched</p>
<p>it sounds like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t mistake the</p>
<p>smell of a dead body it&rsquo;s a very distinct smell</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t confuse it with something else</p>
<p>so george ends up taking the car</p>
<p>home pissed him and his wife cindy are pissed because</p>
<p>first of all why is a car in the</p>
<p>pound have to pay the fees to get the car out</p>
<p>now george is like dude the car</p>
<p>smells like a dead body</p>
<p>so he comes home he tells cindy hey</p>
<p>come here come</p>
<p>smell the car</p>
<p>so cindy comes out</p>
<p>she smells the car she agrees</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a pretty intense foul</p>
<p>odor they pop open the</p>
<p>trunk and they see a</p>
<p>trash bag so cindy</p>
<p>said that they didn&rsquo;t open the</p>
<p>trash bag they just</p>
<p>threw it away</p>
<p>then she said that she used an entire bottle of febreze</p>
<p>on the inside of the car</p>
<p>they left all of the car doors open to help</p>
<p>air it out this is according to cindy</p>
<p>so again naturally</p>
<p>george and cindy are just</p>
<p>super pissed not even</p>
<p>super pissed they&rsquo;re furious you know why did she just</p>
<p>ditch the car why didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>casey say anything does she not have a car how is she</p>
<p>treat getting around</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s kaylee i mean all</p>
<p>these thoughts are</p>
<p>going through their head</p>
<p>and cindy just wanted answers so cindy</p>
<p>tries to get a hold of</p>
<p>casey but she&rsquo;s not having any</p>
<p>luck so her best bet is to go find her last she heard</p>
<p>she was at her new boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house so cindy</p>
<p>goes down there to the boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment now when cindy</p>
<p>gets to the boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment she</p>
<p>knocks on the door</p>
<p>right okay so she goes inside she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s casey</p>
<p>and they take her inside to the living room</p>
<p>cindy says that she looks around and she just notices a</p>
<p>bunch of drug paraphernalia</p>
<p>all around and it</p>
<p>was morning so they&rsquo;re just sitting there getting high</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>lunchtime yet</p>
<p>and cindy&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she walks in like what are you doing</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s kaylee why isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>where is she at why isn&rsquo;t she here</p>
<p>and then casey</p>
<p>told her mom that kaylee was with the nanny</p>
<p>zany so cindy&rsquo;s like okay i can&rsquo;t take this anymore</p>
<p>i can go pick her up</p>
<p>where is she i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen her in months</p>
<p>where is she</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s just getting more and more defensive</p>
<p>as her mom is there questioning her</p>
<p>in front of her boyfriend and her boyfriend&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>cindy tells</p>
<p>casey come on you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going home with me grabs her and tells her that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going home casey</p>
<p>was feeling</p>
<p>super irritated cause</p>
<p>just stormed into her boyfriends like how</p>
<p>could you that&rsquo;s so embarrassing mom</p>
<p>in front of my dj boyfriend cindy and</p>
<p>casey go back to</p>
<p>the family home and cindy calls nine one one to report</p>
<p>casey for stealing the car</p>
<p>then abandoning it</p>
<p>cindy ends up calling nine one one</p>
<p>three different times</p>
<p>the first time she calls 911 she&rsquo;s like this is a</p>
<p>quote i have</p>
<p>someone here who i need to be arrested in my home</p>
<p>and i have a possible missing</p>
<p>child i have a</p>
<p>three year old who&rsquo;s been missing for a month</p>
<p>and quote on the</p>
<p>phone call cindy says</p>
<p>that casey needed to be arrested for</p>
<p>stealing her car</p>
<p>and her money</p>
<p>so cindy is just waiting for the police to show up</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s pacing around the house</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when she overhears</p>
<p>a conversation between</p>
<p>casey and her brother lee</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s listening in</p>
<p>casey tells her brother that she met zany</p>
<p>the nanny at the park to give her kaylee</p>
<p>and when she</p>
<p>arrived zany</p>
<p>held kaylee</p>
<p>close to her pushing casey away</p>
<p>saying that she was taking kaylee away from her and</p>
<p>would not be giving her back</p>
<p>so casey is telling this to her brother</p>
<p>her mom overhears it</p>
<p>calls 911 again</p>
<p>thinking that now there&rsquo;s been a kidnapping that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken place</p>
<p>on the phone cindy is demanding to</p>
<p>speak to an officer</p>
<p>and says that she had just</p>
<p>learned that kaylee was</p>
<p>taken by her babysitter</p>
<p>and has been missing for</p>
<p>months i&rsquo;m sorry for a month</p>
<p>so on this call she says</p>
<p>quote i told you my</p>
<p>daughter has been missing for a</p>
<p>month and i just</p>
<p>found her today</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t find my</p>
<p>granddaughter</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something seriously</p>
<p>wrong i found my</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>today and it</p>
<p>smells like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a dead body in the damn car end quote</p>
<p>so while she&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone with 911 cindy is trying to push</p>
<p>casey to hop on the</p>
<p>phone and talk to the 911 dispatcher and she&rsquo;s growing</p>
<p>frustrated because cindy is</p>
<p>on the phone worried</p>
<p>panicking trying to figure out</p>
<p>where her granddaughter is</p>
<p>and casey was calm</p>
<p>she seemed irritated and</p>
<p>annoyed that her mom</p>
<p>was doing this and making such a big</p>
<p>deal out of it all</p>
<p>and she kept telling her mom that she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to talk to police she didn&rsquo;t want any of this</p>
<p>now cindy is pushing her and pushing her</p>
<p>finally casey gives in and</p>
<p>speaks to the</p>
<p>911 dispatcher saying that she knows who has her</p>
<p>daughter but the</p>
<p>phone number she had for the</p>
<p>nanny was a number that was no longer in service</p>
<p>but earlier that day</p>
<p>the nanny let her</p>
<p>speak to kaylee</p>
<p>and kaylee was okay</p>
<p>casey told a dispatcher that zinata</p>
<p>fernandez gonzalez</p>
<p>was the name of the</p>
<p>nanny that had kaylee</p>
<p>casey said that she had</p>
<p>spoke to the</p>
<p>nanny on july 9th on the</p>
<p>phone and then</p>
<p>again on july 15th</p>
<p>when she allowed her to</p>
<p>speak to kaylee</p>
<p>casey told her</p>
<p>brother lee that she had been communicating with zany</p>
<p>through myspace and was getting instructions from zany</p>
<p>on how to get kaylee back</p>
<p>casey said that zany told her she</p>
<p>would get her</p>
<p>daughter back on kaylee&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<p>to cindy it&rsquo;s just like this is the dumbest</p>
<p>story i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard like why are you not more concerned</p>
<p>about your daughter</p>
<p>so police finally arrive</p>
<p>and then when they arrive they ask</p>
<p>casey to take them</p>
<p>to the last</p>
<p>place that she saw</p>
<p>zany so she takes them to the shaw</p>
<p>grass apartments and</p>
<p>identified which</p>
<p>apartment was zany&rsquo;s</p>
<p>casey said that was</p>
<p>where she dropped off her daughter</p>
<p>and the last time and</p>
<p>place that she had</p>
<p>seen her casey provided a description of ziani</p>
<p>she was 25 years old she was five foot</p>
<p>seven 140 pounds</p>
<p>black hair perfect</p>
<p>teeth from new york and a 10</p>
<p>like whatever that means</p>
<p>which is just like a really weird</p>
<p>thing to mention</p>
<p>in a description</p>
<p>about someone who took your kid</p>
<p>but okay casey tells them that zany the</p>
<p>nanny she was a coworker of hers at universal studios</p>
<p>who was born in new york in the</p>
<p>month of september</p>
<p>she moved to go to the</p>
<p>university of florida</p>
<p>she said she was</p>
<p>mixed she was</p>
<p>black and puerto rican</p>
<p>of course a</p>
<p>white girl trying to pin in on a person of color</p>
<p>so police go up to the</p>
<p>apartment in</p>
<p>which casey said that zany</p>
<p>lived so they</p>
<p>knock on the door</p>
<p>no answer you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>peeking inside they&rsquo;re trying to look in the window</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t look like anyone lives there</p>
<p>so they go down to the landlords</p>
<p>and they ask if they can</p>
<p>have a record as to who live there a history something</p>
<p>right and they told police that no one had</p>
<p>lived in that specific apartment</p>
<p>since march hmm</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>they ask if they can pull surveillance</p>
<p>video from the parking lot but from the day when</p>
<p>casey dropped kaylee off so they ask for</p>
<p>their surveillance</p>
<p>video from the parking lot</p>
<p>and it shows</p>
<p>anyone coming and</p>
<p>going from the specific</p>
<p>apartment and they</p>
<p>never saw this woman</p>
<p>casey described over there</p>
<p>ever they never saw</p>
<p>no one was there</p>
<p>they would have caught someone on tape and at</p>
<p>least they would have caught</p>
<p>maybe kaylee</p>
<p>but nothing</p>
<p>so police are like hmm</p>
<p>like this some shit</p>
<p>they now knew that</p>
<p>casey was lying</p>
<p>for sure so they</p>
<p>start looking more into</p>
<p>casey and her</p>
<p>story so they&rsquo;re asking just a little bit about her</p>
<p>casey told police that she worked at universal</p>
<p>studios so they</p>
<p>did some digging around and they discovered that</p>
<p>casey actually</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t work at universal</p>
<p>studios in fact she</p>
<p>never worked at universal studios</p>
<p>so what was she doing with all this time you know</p>
<p>hmm police uncovered this information</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>casey that they knew this</p>
<p>which i love because</p>
<p>they put her on</p>
<p>blast they took</p>
<p>casey down to universal</p>
<p>studios and</p>
<p>asked casey to take police to her boss</p>
<p>and casey acted as if she did in fact work there i</p>
<p>think she had worked there for a</p>
<p>brief period of time so i shouldn&rsquo;t say she</p>
<p>never worked there but she had gotten</p>
<p>fired long ago</p>
<p>but she was telling everyone that she</p>
<p>still worked there</p>
<p>okay casey&rsquo;s just acting like she does work there</p>
<p>and she walks in</p>
<p>she walks past security into the employee</p>
<p>entrance it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until they got lost in the maze of offices</p>
<p>just going like</p>
<p>like she was just taking them in circles</p>
<p>that she finally</p>
<p>just stops she turns around and she tells the cops</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t work here</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>video footage of it oh it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>beautiful i love it when people get caught in the line</p>
<p>like that like ah</p>
<p>got you they uncover these lies</p>
<p>casey was arrested on july 16th she was</p>
<p>charged with neglect of a</p>
<p>child obstruction of justice</p>
<p>and making false</p>
<p>statements so cindy</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s mom sits down with police and she talks to them</p>
<p>about the car when she got it back from the</p>
<p>pound it had</p>
<p>trash in the</p>
<p>trunk and a box of</p>
<p>pizza with maggots</p>
<p>and she tried to dismiss the</p>
<p>smell as rotting</p>
<p>pizza she&rsquo;s like no no</p>
<p>it was just rotting pizza</p>
<p>rotting pizza</p>
<p>smells like just dead</p>
<p>so the detectives</p>
<p>tried to knock some</p>
<p>sense into her that she knew what</p>
<p>that smell was</p>
<p>she set it on tape on the 911 call</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re pushing her like</p>
<p>are you sure you know</p>
<p>but cindy kept trying to take back her</p>
<p>statement saying nene</p>
<p>it was a rotting pizza</p>
<p>so the car gets</p>
<p>taken in for police to</p>
<p>search so they</p>
<p>bring in one of</p>
<p>those trained</p>
<p>search dogs that can confirm a scent</p>
<p>of a dead body</p>
<p>so they bring in this dog dog</p>
<p>sniffing around and</p>
<p>guess what the dog</p>
<p>starts going</p>
<p>crazy when it</p>
<p>smells the trunk</p>
<p>also they see that on the bottom of the trunk</p>
<p>there was a small</p>
<p>staining happening</p>
<p>which was the size of a</p>
<p>small body i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing because of like how</p>
<p>obvious this is</p>
<p>right the dog</p>
<p>smells the body</p>
<p>they see like a</p>
<p>stain it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smell like a body but it&rsquo;s the size of a body</p>
<p>also the mom calling 911 being like</p>
<p>it smells like a body</p>
<p>all signs are</p>
<p>pointing to there being a body inside the car</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s just so obvious</p>
<p>they take the carpet out of the</p>
<p>trunk of the car and they tested it</p>
<p>and it confirmed</p>
<p>to be decomposition of the body as well as very</p>
<p>strong chloroform</p>
<p>also there was hair</p>
<p>in the trunk of the car</p>
<p>so they did</p>
<p>dna testing</p>
<p>on the hair through</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>when they tested the hair</p>
<p>it came back saying that the hair was either cindy</p>
<p>casey or kaylee&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>the hair was longer than</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s and it was</p>
<p>untreated unlike cindy&rsquo;s meaning it had to be haley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the hair also had what was called a decomposition</p>
<p>band and this is a dark band that can appear</p>
<p>on the hair when the body is</p>
<p>decomposing</p>
<p>investigators also seize the family computer</p>
<p>in hopes to find any type of evidence</p>
<p>so when they&rsquo;re looking through the computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they find or discover</p>
<p>that someone had been</p>
<p>using the computer to google</p>
<p>search quote</p>
<p>how to make</p>
<p>chloroform end</p>
<p>quote alright baby case closed right</p>
<p>what more do they need</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>sorry where&rsquo;s kaylee</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m jumping the gun here but all signs are</p>
<p>pointing to kc i mean it&rsquo;s so obvious</p>
<p>so they ask cindy</p>
<p>hey you know on your computer</p>
<p>we found that someone was</p>
<p>searching for chloroform</p>
<p>can you tell us about that</p>
<p>and cindy said that she</p>
<p>had been searching for chlorophyll</p>
<p>on the computer</p>
<p>because her dogs were eating bamboo in</p>
<p>the backyard and she wanted to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>toxic and during her</p>
<p>search it pulled up</p>
<p>chloroform she saw it</p>
<p>and she clicked it</p>
<p>this is what cindy was saying</p>
<p>chlorophyll</p>
<p>is what makes a</p>
<p>plant green</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know why she</p>
<p>would be searching for chlorophyll</p>
<p>and not just something simple like is bamboo</p>
<p>toxic to docs</p>
<p>so cindy your</p>
<p>story is not making any</p>
<p>sense here babe</p>
<p>through some date more digging around they</p>
<p>realized that cindy wasn&rsquo;t even home when the computer</p>
<p>search was made</p>
<p>and it was proven that</p>
<p>casey was the only one home when that search</p>
<p>was made not cindy</p>
<p>so why was cindy trying so hard to</p>
<p>cover casey&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>it just wasn&rsquo;t making any</p>
<p>sense to investigators no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry it was making</p>
<p>sense to them because it was obvious what was going on</p>
<p>cindy didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>rat her kid out</p>
<p>for some odd</p>
<p>reason well i</p>
<p>could get it but the same time i can&rsquo;t get it so cindy</p>
<p>she goes down to the jail to</p>
<p>visit casey</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s there she&rsquo;s asking</p>
<p>casey what does zany</p>
<p>look like can you tell me what she looks like because</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know what she looks like do you have</p>
<p>photos of her</p>
<p>if the police come to me and ask me to pick her</p>
<p>out of a lineup</p>
<p>how do i identify zany she needs to know</p>
<p>right that can make sense</p>
<p>so cindy tells</p>
<p>casey you know police told me that you couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>point out zany from a lineup</p>
<p>casey was getting really</p>
<p>irritated with her and just</p>
<p>completely shut down well in fact an officer</p>
<p>earlier on did</p>
<p>show casey a</p>
<p>photo of a woman</p>
<p>by the name of zenita gonzalez</p>
<p>aka zanni and</p>
<p>casey was not able to recognize</p>
<p>who they were showing her</p>
<p>in the photos</p>
<p>so zenita gonzalez</p>
<p>she was a real person but</p>
<p>but whoever zany the nanny was</p>
<p>she simply did not</p>
<p>exist they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that she</p>
<p>existed a couple</p>
<p>months down the line</p>
<p>zaneda the real one she filed a defamation lawsuit</p>
<p>against casey</p>
<p>beautiful good for her</p>
<p>when cindy and george visit</p>
<p>casey in jail a</p>
<p>month after she had been there</p>
<p>they inform her that people are saying kaylee</p>
<p>is dead to which</p>
<p>casey rolls her</p>
<p>eyes and says</p>
<p>surprise surprise</p>
<p>end quote cindy asks casey</p>
<p>what her gut is telling her</p>
<p>right now and</p>
<p>casey says that she believes</p>
<p>kaylee is not far</p>
<p>so casey ends up hiring</p>
<p>a man by the name of jose</p>
<p>baes as her</p>
<p>legal attorney</p>
<p>who then writes a letter to the sheriff&rsquo;s office about</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s willingness to cooperate with law enforcement</p>
<p>and soon following</p>
<p>after that a</p>
<p>court judge</p>
<p>sets casey&rsquo;s bail at 500 000</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s bail was paid and she got an</p>
<p>electronic monitoring device</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>released so</p>
<p>casey headed back to her parents home</p>
<p>where she would be staying</p>
<p>and at this</p>
<p>point the media had gotten hold of this</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>going berserk</p>
<p>so at her parents house</p>
<p>it was just filled with media</p>
<p>they were all outside waiting like on the lawn on the</p>
<p>driveway just</p>
<p>but the public was outraged</p>
<p>and furious that</p>
<p>casey was able to be released and go home there were</p>
<p>countless altercations outside the family</p>
<p>house and constantly</p>
<p>media around</p>
<p>it was not only</p>
<p>upsetting to the family</p>
<p>but the whole</p>
<p>block because it turned into this just</p>
<p>chaos on their street</p>
<p>now on august 29th</p>
<p>casey was arrested again</p>
<p>for something that had nothing to do with the case</p>
<p>this is why nobody likes her</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s an idiot</p>
<p>she was arrested because she was caught writing four</p>
<p>checks worth</p>
<p>close to 650</p>
<p>without the person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>permission this time</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>post a 500 000</p>
<p>bond and she&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>again from county jail into</p>
<p>their custody</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why her parents liked her so much</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t seem like that</p>
<p>great of a dollar</p>
<p>but they kept</p>
<p>bailing her out and i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>on december 11th</p>
<p>2008 less than a mile from the anthony</p>
<p>family home</p>
<p>a utility meter</p>
<p>reader was out working and he was</p>
<p>about 20 feet off of the road</p>
<p>he saw what seemed to be something</p>
<p>skull he poked at it with a</p>
<p>stick and then realized that it was indeed like a real</p>
<p>skull and he calls 911 the man who</p>
<p>found the remains had</p>
<p>tried to report</p>
<p>these findings to police</p>
<p>three different times</p>
<p>he founded a couple</p>
<p>months prior</p>
<p>and when he had called</p>
<p>about it you</p>
<p>know someone needs to</p>
<p>check this out he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken seriously</p>
<p>and was told that someone</p>
<p>was going out to the area to</p>
<p>check it out but nothing ever came from it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when he went out there himself</p>
<p>up close to it and</p>
<p>again called 911 so this</p>
<p>time a team goes out there and they find the remains</p>
<p>they find the</p>
<p>skull they find</p>
<p>well okay look they find a skull</p>
<p>and the skull had</p>
<p>duct tape on it</p>
<p>and nearby was a bag</p>
<p>which included the rest of the bones</p>
<p>and then a baby</p>
<p>blanket with winnie the poo</p>
<p>and piglet on it was</p>
<p>like in another</p>
<p>laundry bag</p>
<p>they knew immediately</p>
<p>it was the bones of a</p>
<p>child on december 19th police</p>
<p>they came forward and announced that the dna testing</p>
<p>confirmed that the remains belonged to kaylee anthony</p>
<p>so the police they get a warrant</p>
<p>for the anthony</p>
<p>house and they discover</p>
<p>that kaylee&rsquo;s room had been</p>
<p>a winnie the pooh themed room</p>
<p>which would</p>
<p>align with the</p>
<p>blanket that they found</p>
<p>with her body in the</p>
<p>house they also discovered a twin bag to the</p>
<p>white one that they</p>
<p>found at the scene</p>
<p>where kaylee&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>were also found it was a laundry bag and it was sold</p>
<p>only in pairs and the anthony</p>
<p>households contained just one of the pair</p>
<p>to the bag that was</p>
<p>found at the</p>
<p>scene these</p>
<p>two very specific items made it</p>
<p>clear whoever killed kaylee</p>
<p>whoever it was we just may</p>
<p>never know was not a stranger</p>
<p>and would have had access to the family home</p>
<p>casey now was being</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>now if any of you remember this</p>
<p>cause i remember when it was all over the news you</p>
<p>could not avoid this</p>
<p>story cause it was like what the heck oh it was bad</p>
<p>it really took a toll on the family though</p>
<p>it seems like this is an opinion</p>
<p>but based off the facts i presented it seems like cindy</p>
<p>she was like ride or die for</p>
<p>casey and she was not</p>
<p>gonna let her</p>
<p>spend the rest of her life in prison</p>
<p>and take responsibility for what she had done</p>
<p>meanwhile george</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s father he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taking it so well</p>
<p>he seemed to be the only one in the</p>
<p>household with a</p>
<p>level head he knew that</p>
<p>casey was responsible for it</p>
<p>when he would</p>
<p>bring it up to his wife cindy</p>
<p>she would tell him no</p>
<p>no like she just didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>admit the truth the</p>
<p>media is just ripping</p>
<p>apart this family people were just being very</p>
<p>nasty towards</p>
<p>their parents</p>
<p>cindy may have deserved it but poor george</p>
<p>he really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>anywho but in january of 2009 george he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t doing well</p>
<p>and he was staying in a hotel</p>
<p>and he was mixing drugs and alcohol and someone had</p>
<p>called the police to do a wellness</p>
<p>check and that&rsquo;s when police</p>
<p>found him in a hotel</p>
<p>not doing well like he</p>
<p>tried to kill himself</p>
<p>yeah i guess that&rsquo;s what he was doing because he</p>
<p>wrote a lengthy</p>
<p>suicide note that he</p>
<p>seem to have written like on the</p>
<p>hotel piece of</p>
<p>paper you know</p>
<p>and he ended it with</p>
<p>quote kaylee</p>
<p>here i come</p>
<p>he seemed to be taking it the hardest</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just sad he got to a</p>
<p>point where he just wanted to end it because</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore anyways but they</p>
<p>found him and he was he was safe but</p>
<p>that happened</p>
<p>may twenty fourth two thousand eleven the</p>
<p>trial begins</p>
<p>george and cindy</p>
<p>would not have normally been allowed in the</p>
<p>courtroom because they were witnesses</p>
<p>technically but</p>
<p>they were allowed to be present because they were the</p>
<p>grandparents they were allowed to be there if</p>
<p>they promised to show no emotion</p>
<p>now they were heavily scrutinized because they showed</p>
<p>no emotion in</p>
<p>court but many people forgot</p>
<p>that they had been asked</p>
<p>not to show emotion</p>
<p>and if they did show emotion they</p>
<p>would be asked to leave</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m losing my voice</p>
<p>casey obviously</p>
<p>completely lied</p>
<p>throughout the investigation there was no</p>
<p>nanny and there was no job at universal studios</p>
<p>so the question became</p>
<p>how do you live a</p>
<p>light like that</p>
<p>casey said that when she was 8 years old her dad</p>
<p>began to molest her</p>
<p>and she learned to lie at a</p>
<p>young age because of it</p>
<p>now george took the</p>
<p>stand and he said that he did not molest</p>
<p>their proof</p>
<p>casey didn&rsquo;t go to the</p>
<p>gynecologist</p>
<p>until she was</p>
<p>seven months pregnant</p>
<p>and that was the</p>
<p>first time she had ever been to one</p>
<p>so can you imagine</p>
<p>hearing for the</p>
<p>first time that your</p>
<p>daughter is trying to pin the</p>
<p>whole thing on you making up that you molested them</p>
<p>you killing your</p>
<p>child absolutely</p>
<p>i mean how why</p>
<p>but then lying</p>
<p>that your your father is molesting and like</p>
<p>whispering so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>so might be listening</p>
<p>but the fact that you lie</p>
<p>at your father molested you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how she</p>
<p>how she could sit there</p>
<p>and say that and her father is</p>
<p>watching like</p>
<p>this is new news to me gosh it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>absolutely disgusting</p>
<p>disgusting did i tell you i hate her</p>
<p>cause i really</p>
<p>do i don&rsquo;t support hitting or beating your kids at all</p>
<p>but if i watched my</p>
<p>grown ass adult child</p>
<p>lying on the</p>
<p>stand like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d beat her ass</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>anyways again</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to show any type of emotion</p>
<p>in court but this tore</p>
<p>him up it was a</p>
<p>shock to him he didn&rsquo;t know that this was the plan</p>
<p>so it was just</p>
<p>heartbreaking not only did he lose a</p>
<p>granddaughter</p>
<p>but now he&rsquo;s losing his</p>
<p>daughter and</p>
<p>his wife because his wife was just accepting that</p>
<p>this i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s a personal</p>
<p>opinion but i just don&rsquo;t believe that it happened</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t uh uh</p>
<p>nope so the prosecution came and they gave</p>
<p>their theory</p>
<p>casey anthony killed</p>
<p>her daughter by</p>
<p>using chloroform</p>
<p>to knock her</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>then use duct</p>
<p>tape to cover her mouth</p>
<p>and block her airways</p>
<p>casey then wrapped kaylee in her favorite</p>
<p>blanket put her body in the</p>
<p>trunk of her car</p>
<p>she then went to her</p>
<p>boyfriend&rsquo;s that next day and then the next day they</p>
<p>believe that she took kaylee&rsquo;s body out into the woods</p>
<p>in a trash bag</p>
<p>now the defense&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>was that cindy</p>
<p>was at work</p>
<p>and george and</p>
<p>casey were looking for kaylee</p>
<p>they said that george</p>
<p>found kaylee</p>
<p>drowned in the pool</p>
<p>and yelled at</p>
<p>casey look what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>your mother will</p>
<p>never forgive you</p>
<p>and then george helped her dispose of the body by</p>
<p>wrapping kaylee in plastic like he</p>
<p>would do with</p>
<p>their pets when they died now there was another theory</p>
<p>which is just cindy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>theory now cindy believed that kaylee accidentally</p>
<p>drowned in the pool</p>
<p>while casey was</p>
<p>watching her</p>
<p>casey must have</p>
<p>freaked out and</p>
<p>tried to dispose her</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t realize what she was doing</p>
<p>i hate her poor george i hope george is okay</p>
<p>now george had his own theory</p>
<p>he believed that</p>
<p>casey was giving her xanax</p>
<p>aka zanni the</p>
<p>nanny you see</p>
<p>some people used to call i don&rsquo;t know if they</p>
<p>still call xanax zanni</p>
<p>or zans or zan</p>
<p>whatever they</p>
<p>call it but i remember there was a time when like zany</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna take a zany tonight</p>
<p>yes i just want to let</p>
<p>loose and take a zany</p>
<p>so it makes</p>
<p>sense right</p>
<p>so george believes that</p>
<p>casey was giving her xanax</p>
<p>and then calling</p>
<p>the xanax like zanni the</p>
<p>nanny because it</p>
<p>would help her</p>
<p>sleep and you know</p>
<p>babysit babysit</p>
<p>while casey went out and partied</p>
<p>hung out with her boyfriend</p>
<p>and gave her the freedom to do what she wanted he</p>
<p>thinks that he gave her too much xanax</p>
<p>and she just didn&rsquo;t wake up</p>
<p>george is the</p>
<p>only one around here with some goddamn common</p>
<p>sense zany i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take a</p>
<p>xanax and just</p>
<p>think again</p>
<p>where the hell was she getting xanax from</p>
<p>dj boyfriend i bet you</p>
<p>i think there was another theory out there by like the</p>
<p>media and just</p>
<p>speculation</p>
<p>and i kind of i</p>
<p>could see this kind of being true</p>
<p>think she was probably using</p>
<p>chloroform to</p>
<p>knock kaylee out</p>
<p>and then maybe she like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why she put</p>
<p>duct tape around her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to</p>
<p>knock your kid out with chloroform</p>
<p>to go out i</p>
<p>guess okay but then to like</p>
<p>duct tape i just</p>
<p>i got so many questions and no answers okay</p>
<p>so the casey anthony</p>
<p>trial was a shit show</p>
<p>i mean casey&rsquo;s team was blaming anyone</p>
<p>and everyone</p>
<p>for what happened to kaylee it was</p>
<p>messy it was petty</p>
<p>anyone with</p>
<p>brain cells who was</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>trial paying attention</p>
<p>knew it was</p>
<p>casey jurors</p>
<p>were talking</p>
<p>about the case outside of court</p>
<p>which is a huge nene</p>
<p>okay you don&rsquo;t do that but</p>
<p>one juror was selling information to an online blocker</p>
<p>for some reason</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s team was</p>
<p>going hard trying to</p>
<p>point the finger at her father</p>
<p>and include him somehow</p>
<p>like she really had something</p>
<p>against her dad</p>
<p>it was really sad</p>
<p>there was nothing</p>
<p>tying him to the</p>
<p>crime but it turned into a circus</p>
<p>and facts were getting confused with opinions because</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s team was just</p>
<p>pointing the finger</p>
<p>so then the</p>
<p>trial focused on</p>
<p>things that didn&rsquo;t matter for far too long they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even looking at facts anymore</p>
<p>it was just trying to</p>
<p>clear the father&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>disprove everything that</p>
<p>casey seems</p>
<p>throwing at them is a mess</p>
<p>the trial it goes on for a very long time</p>
<p>and on july 5th</p>
<p>after about 10</p>
<p>hours of deliberation</p>
<p>the jury comes back and they have an answer</p>
<p>many of you may remember this day</p>
<p>cause i certainly do i</p>
<p>was like she&rsquo;s guilty she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guilty i can&rsquo;t wait to see her face when they read</p>
<p>guilty i was sitting there just like yay bye</p>
<p>bitch so the jury comes back</p>
<p>casey anthony</p>
<p>is not guilty</p>
<p>not guilty what people lost</p>
<p>their shit i remember heads were exploding</p>
<p>everywhere okay people were</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>furious you know why because they had distracted and</p>
<p>watered down the</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>focusing on</p>
<p>casey&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>and like what</p>
<p>he may have done to her and how it just wasn&rsquo;t her</p>
<p>fault casey is convicted</p>
<p>of four four misdemeanor</p>
<p>charges of giving</p>
<p>false information to a law enforcement officer</p>
<p>judge perry</p>
<p>sentenced casey to one year</p>
<p>in county jail and 1 000</p>
<p>in fines now at that</p>
<p>point casey had served</p>
<p>three years already</p>
<p>so she got credit plus</p>
<p>additional credit</p>
<p>for good behavior</p>
<p>and with that being said</p>
<p>she was good to go baby you&rsquo;re free</p>
<p>casey would be released from prison on july 17</p>
<p>2011 that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story if you remember</p>
<p>watching this on tv</p>
<p>like i was we were livid</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>it still is the jurors</p>
<p>in that case they were scared</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>were receiving</p>
<p>death threats of</p>
<p>their own they kept the jurors</p>
<p>names quiet for x amount of time but</p>
<p>after that it was just like here are</p>
<p>their names everyone</p>
<p>oh it wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>i feel like they just</p>
<p>should have left the jurors</p>
<p>alone and gone</p>
<p>after like casey directly but</p>
<p>i guess that&rsquo;s just me</p>
<p>so after the</p>
<p>trial it came out that</p>
<p>casey had filed for bankruptcy</p>
<p>twice and was unable to pay her lawyer jose base</p>
<p>so what happens when you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money to pay your lawyer</p>
<p>well she paid him in</p>
<p>sexual favors</p>
<p>someone even reported seeing</p>
<p>casey completely</p>
<p>naked in his office and she accidentally</p>
<p>walked in on it and they were like oh shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not illegal to have sex with your lawyer</p>
<p>okay you can and you you can but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly unethical</p>
<p>i guess they were having a little bit of a relationship</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>facts about</p>
<p>their relationship it was more</p>
<p>like just opinions</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on between the two of them</p>
<p>but i think it was pretty clear that</p>
<p>she was having</p>
<p>sex with him</p>
<p>and he must have</p>
<p>loved it so much that he helped her</p>
<p>be free i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know anyways so what happened with the zenata gonzalez</p>
<p>defamation case you ask well</p>
<p>the judge toss that one</p>
<p>right out i don&rsquo;t know you guys i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know in 2017</p>
<p>it was revealed that there was a</p>
<p>search on the family&rsquo;s computer for fool</p>
<p>proof suffocation</p>
<p>and that only</p>
<p>could have occurred</p>
<p>while casey was at home</p>
<p>it was also discovered that 48</p>
<p>hours before</p>
<p>casey was arrested her internet history</p>
<p>was deleted</p>
<p>which is just</p>
<p>classic suspicious</p>
<p>behavior also in 2017</p>
<p>casey did an interview</p>
<p>you can watch it online</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tag it download</p>
<p>but casey said that she remembers waking</p>
<p>up that morning and saying goodbye to her mom and then</p>
<p>going back to</p>
<p>sleep when she woke up kaylee was missing</p>
<p>her story changes again</p>
<p>kaylee is now</p>
<p>she was missing</p>
<p>her mother theorize that casey</p>
<p>might have had a</p>
<p>seizure like she was</p>
<p>known to do</p>
<p>and during her</p>
<p>blackout she&rsquo;s having a seizure</p>
<p>she blacks out kaylee</p>
<p>must have died</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their stories straight</p>
<p>okay why don&rsquo;t you just come out and say you did it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sick of the shit also in this interview</p>
<p>she said that she&rsquo;s okay with herself and that she</p>
<p>sleeps good at</p>
<p>night in 2017 kaylee</p>
<p>would have been 12 years old</p>
<p>and when the interviewer</p>
<p>asked casey what she thought</p>
<p>kaylee would be like at 12 years old</p>
<p>casey said quote</p>
<p>a total badass</p>
<p>and she laughed saying she&rsquo;d probably listen to</p>
<p>classic rock play sports and</p>
<p>not take shit from anybody</p>
<p>casey took up</p>
<p>photography</p>
<p>when she was released</p>
<p>and not because she wanted to take pretty photos</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>but because she wants to become a private investigator</p>
<p>she may be one now i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>cause this was back in 2017</p>
<p>daisy said that</p>
<p>one of the reasons she&rsquo;s so good at her job as a pi</p>
<p>is because she learned</p>
<p>firsthand how to research people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>backgrounds</p>
<p>search for information</p>
<p>and gather all the information needed</p>
<p>the interviewer</p>
<p>then asked do you really</p>
<p>think that your father had something to do with it</p>
<p>and casey said that her father</p>
<p>had kaylee when she saw her last</p>
<p>and that she wasn&rsquo;t sure what happened</p>
<p>after that again</p>
<p>stick with your story girl</p>
<p>literally a fish out of</p>
<p>water just flip flopping all over the place</p>
<p>with her stories</p>
<p>george has consistently denied all</p>
<p>these allegations</p>
<p>casey said that she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about what anybody thinks</p>
<p>about her and she</p>
<p>never will hmm</p>
<p>and that my friends is the</p>
<p>awful story</p>
<p>about casey anthony</p>
<p>she got away with murder</p>
<p>and it was messy too</p>
<p>i guess what surprises me the most with this</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>is that like nobody&rsquo;s kicked her ass</p>
<p>i mean like i&rsquo;m not saying that anyone</p>
<p>should please don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be an adult</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m i was waiting for like a</p>
<p>article to come up or something</p>
<p>about somebody kicking her ass i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>irritating like what if you</p>
<p>watch the interviews with her she has like this</p>
<p>snarkiness this this overly</p>
<p>confidence because</p>
<p>she got away with murder she can get away with anything</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how she kind of acts she has a little</p>
<p>picture of casey on her</p>
<p>on her like man talks like</p>
<p>bitch take that off</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t deserve that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never come out and apologize to her father</p>
<p>about lying her father said that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have really any relationship with her</p>
<p>cindy still</p>
<p>ride or die for her</p>
<p>daughter yeah</p>
<p>and i think this is a perfect</p>
<p>example of what can happen when you don&rsquo;t hold your</p>
<p>kid response</p>
<p>accountable for</p>
<p>their actions</p>
<p>it just seems like she got away with whatever</p>
<p>she wanted in life and nobody ever disciplined her</p>
<p>over that and it shows</p>
<p>i hope she lives a very</p>
<p>miserable life i&rsquo;m sure one day</p>
<p>and i hope nobody</p>
<p>gives her a book deal okay but i&rsquo;m sure one day she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out with her</p>
<p>her own little version of</p>
<p>the oj book if i had done it i bet you she will</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna need</p>
<p>money at some</p>
<p>point she&rsquo;s a loser</p>
<p>and i hope no one hires her i just hope she has a very</p>
<p>awful life i</p>
<p>could say that because</p>
<p>i hope she does</p>
<p>rest in peace to poor</p>
<p>poor little kaylee anthony</p>
<p>she died because her</p>
<p>mother is a</p>
<p>selfish bitch</p>
<p>who probably won&rsquo;t ever change because</p>
<p>why should she</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s been working out for her this far you know</p>
<p>i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day i hope you</p>
<p>have a wonderful rest of your day you make good choices</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>think she lies so much that</p>
<p>she actually believes it i mean that&rsquo;s the only way you</p>
<p>could probably go to</p>
<p>sleep at night is if you</p>
<p>truly believed your own lies i mean how else do you</p>
<p>sleep at night knowing you murdered your own</p>
<p>child so you</p>
<p>could party</p>
<p>hmm hmm hmm</p>
<p>can you let me know hmm</p>
