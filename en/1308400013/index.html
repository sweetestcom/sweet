    <p>hi friends it&rsquo;s time for Sunday service once again happy Sunday Pastor Leo here</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s funny as fuck some of you guys have been commenting that on my</p>
<p>tick-tock you&rsquo;ve been calling me like Pastor Leo and shit I think that is so</p>
<p>funny but anyway I need to tell you guys I have two tick-tock accounts a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know that like some people just find my not Leo for legal reasons</p>
<p>and then they just assume that&rsquo;s the only one I have I have another tick-tock</p>
<p>but anyway this week I want to just ramble and talk some shit about some</p>
<p>recent realizations I&rsquo;ve had I swear realizations just hit me out of fucking</p>
<p>nowhere I was just making tuna the other day minding my business and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s my spirit guides or the universe or whoever threw me a fucking curveball</p>
<p>of awareness and it like smacked me in the face I&rsquo;m like bitch I&rsquo;m cooking</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;m not thinking about that why are you just throwing thoughts in my</p>
<p>brain I don&rsquo;t like it I don&rsquo;t like the random realizations I like the ones</p>
<p>where I sit down and I like journal it out and I try to figure out what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on those are the realizations I like I don&rsquo;t like the ones where I just get</p>
<p>like a random fucking download when I&rsquo;m like cooking tuna or I&rsquo;m at the gym you</p>
<p>know I just want to ramble and share these with you because honestly if I</p>
<p>gotta realize that you do too bitch so the first one I want to talk about is</p>
<p>cat so I have a black cat and her name is cat but it&rsquo;s spelled with the K so I</p>
<p>was just sitting there the other day observing her I was just looking at her</p>
<p>and I like love her like my love for her fucking like flipped into overdrive</p>
<p>because the little bitch is not bothered by anything like I admire that about her</p>
<p>this sounds so stupid but I&rsquo;m gonna get into the full realization like just bear</p>
<p>with me don&rsquo;t rush me I&rsquo;m the only one here I&rsquo;m losing my mind I&rsquo;m losing my</p>
<p>fucking mind I am the only one here recording this podcast and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t rush me bitch shut up so yeah I was watching cat and I had this full</p>
<p>fucking like revelation that the bitch just does not let anything bother her</p>
<p>like she was walking around and following me from room to room so like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming she was like needy and she wanted attention and she wanted to like</p>
<p>be near me and I was like busy running around doing shit so I walked to the</p>
<p>laundry room to my room and then I walked to the bathroom and then to the</p>
<p>bathroom in the guest room and I was just like beep bopping around doing my</p>
<p>shit and cleaning and cat was following me like she would just show up in the</p>
<p>room I was in and just look at me and then I would go to the next room and she</p>
<p>would just follow me it was the cutest fucking thing but I admired that about</p>
<p>her because she was lonely she wanted attention so she followed me and then I</p>
<p>sat down at my desk and I was on my computer and she just came and sat next</p>
<p>to me and that&rsquo;s when I realized I was like yo she just has something and does</p>
<p>it like she feels needy she wants attention so she just comes and gets</p>
<p>near me and I loved it like I personally would never oh my god like I&rsquo;m so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be annoying like how she just followed me room to room I thought</p>
<p>it was the cutest fucking thing but if I was needy and I like wanted to be around</p>
<p>somebody I would think that walking to the room they were in and like following</p>
<p>I would think I&rsquo;m being annoying like I would be so scared for them to perceive</p>
<p>me as like annoying and be like what the fuck like get away from me you know but</p>
<p>like she didn&rsquo;t care she does not have that thought like she was lonely and she</p>
<p>wanted to be around me so she followed me around she came and sat down next to</p>
<p>me at the computer and just sat there like wanted to be near me so she came</p>
<p>and got near me I love that I&rsquo;m inspired by the fucking cat because now if I want</p>
<p>to hang out with somebody I&rsquo;m just gonna go hang out with them if I want to go</p>
<p>be around I&rsquo;m gonna go be around them like I know that sounds so childish but</p>
<p>we really need to get back to that level of simplicity but with cat another thing</p>
<p>I realized about her like this little bitch I love her so much more now like I</p>
<p>loved her before but now like oh my god she&rsquo;s like my little teacher I was</p>
<p>laying in bed and like she does this thing where she&rsquo;ll she&rsquo;s weird she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like me she&rsquo;s very detached if she&rsquo;s very clingy like when I want to</p>
<p>when I want to be petted pet me when I want you to hang out with me give me</p>
<p>attention but when I don&rsquo;t leave me the fuck alone so when she wants attention</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m like laying in the bed getting ready to go to sleep she&rsquo;ll like do this</p>
<p>thing with her paw where she like scratches me and like not scratches me</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;ll like try to pull my arm to her to pet her but it scratches me and</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;m like ow you fucking rat and then I&rsquo;ll just like pet her but like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how she gets my attention when she wants to be petted she&rsquo;ll get it she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care oh maybe I&rsquo;m gonna piss him off maybe I&rsquo;m gonna scratch him like</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s gonna pet me like she doesn&rsquo;t consider she&rsquo;s being annoying and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like she wants to be petted so she&rsquo;s gonna be petted and I love it but when I</p>
<p>get annoyed or aggravated she doesn&rsquo;t make it mean anything about her she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like oh my god I&rsquo;m annoying like he just got mad at me and yelled at me</p>
<p>because I scratched him because I wanted attention she doesn&rsquo;t make it mean</p>
<p>anything about her she&rsquo;s just like okay he&rsquo;s not gonna pet me so she&rsquo;ll just lay</p>
<p>down like she doesn&rsquo;t take anything personal and I do I am the most take it</p>
<p>personal ass motherfucker you will ever meet like my feelings are hurt 99% of the</p>
<p>time no one just ever knows I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot better at it but I just love that</p>
<p>about cat because when she wants attention she&rsquo;ll go to get it like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll go to the place or the person to get it and if they don&rsquo;t want to give it</p>
<p>to her she doesn&rsquo;t get upset about it she doesn&rsquo;t get like oh my god I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>annoying oh my god she doesn&rsquo;t make it mean anything about her and I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>inspired by that like I fucking love that like it&rsquo;s just so simple like cat</p>
<p>makes it so simple and I love it like if she&rsquo;s hungry she&rsquo;ll go to her fucking</p>
<p>little food bowl she&rsquo;s not worried about anything else if she needs to fucking</p>
<p>get some water she&rsquo;ll go to her little water bowl like if she wants attention</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll come to me and try and get it if I don&rsquo;t give it to her she&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll walk off and lay down and whatever she&rsquo;s gonna do like she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take anything personal yo like I have a whole new appreciation for her and pets</p>
<p>in general because babies are like that too like little kids before they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>socialized and fucked up like kids are like that kids are so simple kids are so</p>
<p>just like I have a feeling I have an urge and I go do it cat when she wants</p>
<p>attention is not like oh my god I don&rsquo;t want to be annoying oh my god I want to</p>
<p>piss him off like she&rsquo;ll just come find me when she has an urge for attention</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t get in her head and try to convince herself no you shouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>that you shouldn&rsquo;t want to go be petted like no don&rsquo;t be an asshole don&rsquo;t go do</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;s gonna make him mad at you like she doesn&rsquo;t get in her head she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t overthink she doesn&rsquo;t hold herself back from what she wants she</p>
<p>just goes for it like it&rsquo;s been in front of my face this whole time but I just</p>
<p>now realize this you know just I was just looking at her I was just staring</p>
<p>at her while she was sitting next to my computer this day that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>all this she was just sitting next to my computer looking real cute and I just</p>
<p>looked at her in her little face and it all hit me at once and I was like oh my</p>
<p>god I fucking love her even more so of course I can&rsquo;t just let it stop there I</p>
<p>had to take it one step further and I kind of flipped it like I see another</p>
<p>perspective now of people that take shit personal they are so annoying to be</p>
<p>around it is so draining to be around someone that takes everything fucking</p>
<p>personal and takes everything as an attack on them I used to be one of these</p>
<p>motherfuckers like I still am but I just do it to myself in my head like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not annoying to other people about how often I get my feelings hurt I talk</p>
<p>to myself in my head like I&rsquo;ve sorted out with me and if I need to involve the</p>
<p>other person I will I&rsquo;m good at seeing other perspectives if every time a cat</p>
<p>went to like touch me and like wanted to be near me if I knew she was gonna make</p>
<p>it mean that I didn&rsquo;t like her if I didn&rsquo;t pet her I&rsquo;d be like fuck now I</p>
<p>got a pet you because I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings like that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>people being needy is annoying is when they make it mean something personal</p>
<p>about them like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fucking draining and I&rsquo;ll be annoyed with you if</p>
<p>you make me feel guilty for not doing everything you say and everything you</p>
<p>want when you want it like if cat comes up to me and I don&rsquo;t want to pet her</p>
<p>right now she&rsquo;s not gonna be like oh my god he doesn&rsquo;t love me oh my god I get</p>
<p>like upset like she doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck she&rsquo;s like okay I&rsquo;ll come back later and</p>
<p>then she&rsquo;ll come back later and I&rsquo;ll pet her later and she&rsquo;s happy and fine like</p>
<p>I know this is very simple and this can easily be taken out of context but you</p>
<p>get my point and you get how simple it is but the people that make shit mean</p>
<p>something about them like every time it&rsquo;s like bro give it a fucking rest</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything about you like cat it doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t love</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;m busy babe you see I&rsquo;m on my fucking computer I&rsquo;m busy I&rsquo;ll pet you</p>
<p>later I&rsquo;ll play with you later don&rsquo;t bite my fucking laptop screen I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>smack you in the head like she does that shit but she doesn&rsquo;t take anything</p>
<p>personal so I feel comfortable being around her and you can translate that to</p>
<p>people too like if someone is busy like if I&rsquo;m busy and someone calls me and</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t answer the phone and they get all like pussy hurt about it like oh</p>
<p>my god he doesn&rsquo;t care about me he never answers and then and it&rsquo;s like bitch I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking busy but you should just tell yourself in your head okay Leo didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>answer my call he&rsquo;s probably busy whatever and then fucking beep bop on</p>
<p>your way like oh he&rsquo;s probably busy like self soothe yourself reassure yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not the problem all the time something is not always wrong and I know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so hard to do because I grew up there was always something fucking wrong</p>
<p>so now when there&rsquo;s not something wrong with me or someone&rsquo;s not mad at me I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do but like the person calling me if I know that</p>
<p>every time you call me and I don&rsquo;t answer the phone you&rsquo;re gonna get upset</p>
<p>by it I&rsquo;m gonna get really fucking annoyed I&rsquo;m gonna feel pressure to</p>
<p>answer the phone every time you call because I don&rsquo;t want it I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>hurt your feelings it&rsquo;s like you make everything hurt your own fucking</p>
<p>feelings but I&rsquo;m the one responsible for it I don&rsquo;t like that that&rsquo;s draining all</p>
<p>these realizations hit me at once just because I looked at fucking cat okay if</p>
<p>you ever want to know why I&rsquo;m always alone and why I&rsquo;m like if you ever catch</p>
<p>me like staring off in space in public something just hit me and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>non-fucking-stop dude but a lot of times with my realizations I&rsquo;ll have like a</p>
<p>half realization and then I&rsquo;ll have to sit down and fucking like figure the</p>
<p>rest out and that&rsquo;s what my app is for here I am plugging my app but it I</p>
<p>actually use it like I use it for myself it&rsquo;s a tool I created but I&rsquo;d be using</p>
<p>the bitch my app is called positive focus it&rsquo;s positive quotes and</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a whole section of journal prompts and it&rsquo;s full of</p>
<p>basically like questions to ask yourself for shadow work or if you&rsquo;re having some</p>
<p>realization and you need to fully figure it out and you don&rsquo;t like understand it</p>
<p>yet the questions in my app will help you understand it better and see shit</p>
<p>from more perspectives like the realizations will just expand and get</p>
<p>deeper if you ask yourself the questions that are in my app and there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of different topics for different questions but I&rsquo;ll link it in the</p>
<p>description of this podcast if you want to download it it&rsquo;s called positive</p>
<p>focus it&rsquo;s on the Google phones and the Apple phones and everybody phone</p>
<p>everybody can get it it&rsquo;s the blue icon with the eyeball so if you just want to</p>
<p>search it you can but back to the phone call thing I feel like I need to like</p>
<p>drill this even further because the people that listen to this if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like me you&rsquo;re sensitive just like me and you&rsquo;re the motherfucker that gets</p>
<p>butthurt when they don&rsquo;t answer your call because that&rsquo;s still me but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>better at now being like oh they&rsquo;re probably busy does that make sense like</p>
<p>you can see both sides now how you being needy is not annoying you having</p>
<p>needs is not annoying but you making everything mean something about you and</p>
<p>making everything be hurtful to you is fucking annoying you assuming that</p>
<p>people are mad at you or don&rsquo;t care about you is what&rsquo;s annoying sorry I</p>
<p>need to hear that too that kind of hurt my feelings a little bit okay so my next</p>
<p>realization is a little bit deeper and applies kind of more across the board I</p>
<p>mean that one is very across the board if you make that fit to your fucking</p>
<p>life if you got the point you got it but this one is more about you assuming that</p>
<p>everyone is doing better than you and handling things better than you or that</p>
<p>they are better than you because they have a certain title or they have a</p>
<p>certain amount of money or they are this certain thing you automatically assume</p>
<p>something comes with something else so because someone has a certain amount of</p>
<p>money so if someone is rich or someone is a doctor they hold a certain title we</p>
<p>assume that certain things come with that we assume they&rsquo;re gonna be a</p>
<p>certain way given what they have or given the title that they are does that</p>
<p>make sense so when you look at a doctor you wouldn&rsquo;t think a doctor is out</p>
<p>shoving his nose full of coke on the weekends but most of them are most of</p>
<p>them are drugged out most like doctors are like little children emotionally</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re so smart with what they do but they&rsquo;re emotionally stunted as fuck</p>
<p>when it comes to like their real life and their really their personal</p>
<p>relationships or like someone rich you would not expect them to be insecure I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why my brain just automatically assumes that but like</p>
<p>bitch you got too much money to be insecure shut the fuck up like ooh when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rich you are never gonna be able to tell me a fuck thing sorry you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna tell me shit when I&rsquo;m a fucking millionaire but my point is just because</p>
<p>someone has something or is something like they have a certain title it does</p>
<p>not mean anything else it does not mean they are instantly smarter or better</p>
<p>than you in other ways like they might have a leg up in one area but not others</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you see these fitness people and you see these people in</p>
<p>really good shape the way that they take care of their body and how much</p>
<p>effort they put into their physical appearance you would assume that they</p>
<p>care about their health and that they&rsquo;re taking care of their health and that</p>
<p>they care about their self but the reality is of most of these little</p>
<p>fitness influencers and people that are in really good shape they treat their</p>
<p>body like hell they do drew a lot of drugs they&rsquo;ll do steroids duh but they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat like shit they&rsquo;ll drink a lot and they will fuck anything that walks like</p>
<p>they have little to no standards because they&rsquo;re insecure but you looking at them</p>
<p>and their perfect body and their cute ass face and they&rsquo;re clean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hygienic they have a nice car you would assume that they are a certain way</p>
<p>because of the way that they present but it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything else just</p>
<p>because they work out it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re smart well one way I can prove</p>
<p>this is Paige Hathaway I love her I have followed her for like eight years</p>
<p>she is so fucking like pretty and like I love her little personality but the</p>
<p>bitch is a ditz like she is not that right and like if someone says this to</p>
<p>her fuck you you rat but to if Paige ever listens to this love you bitch like</p>
<p>I love the fuck out of you but you&rsquo;re my perfect like example for this because</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s so smart with what she does but she is not the smartest on anything else</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s just a dunce she&rsquo;s like a little bit dumb and I love that about</p>
<p>her but you&rsquo;d look at her and assume that she&rsquo;s the full package when like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the way that she looks that&rsquo;s making you assume that but like with the</p>
<p>fitness people I wouldn&rsquo;t assume that they&rsquo;re out like degrading their self by</p>
<p>sleeping with like hundreds of fucking people I personally look at that as</p>
<p>degrading because you need to be picky with who you allow to have access to</p>
<p>your physical body you can&rsquo;t just let anyone touch you and fuck you that is</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a conversation that this generation is not fucking ready for but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d expect them to hold their self to a higher standard and they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>just because someone presents a certain way it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are that</p>
<p>thing a perfect example is someone that I know of that is a psychologist and he</p>
<p>literally works all day as a psychologist and he&rsquo;s a fucking predator</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s not an actual predator but I look at him like he&rsquo;s very creepy very</p>
<p>predator vibes every time you go out you&rsquo;ll see him with some guy that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>20 like early 20s and he&rsquo;s like in his 40s he&rsquo;s got money he&rsquo;s got his little</p>
<p>psychologist title and you would assume that he&rsquo;s a certain way he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>weirdo he&rsquo;s out fucking young kids kids like young guys he&rsquo;s gay obviously but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like out fucking young guys and like behaving a certain way and doing</p>
<p>this shit that like 20 year olds are doing like why are you still running the</p>
<p>fucking bars in your old age like you&rsquo;re in your 40s like why are you still</p>
<p>trying to fuck 20 year olds why are you doing that every weekend like I get</p>
<p>having a little phase but bitch you&rsquo;ve been doing this a little bit too long</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my point is like you&rsquo;d assume he would behave a certain way and not do</p>
<p>certain things that he is doing because he&rsquo;s a psychologist like does that make</p>
<p>sense like you just hold people to a certain standard based off of what they</p>
<p>look like or what they do and if you ever see them behind closed doors they</p>
<p>will fall short of that standard a thousand times out of ten I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>constantly like let down by people because you see that they are a certain</p>
<p>thing or they are a certain way and you&rsquo;d expect like certain attributes and</p>
<p>character traits to come with that and it doesn&rsquo;t like there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>that are like oh my god it&rsquo;s so frustrating I don&rsquo;t know how to explain</p>
<p>it like I hope I explained it enough where you guys get it in this but like</p>
<p>it just it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me I get let down a lot because I expect</p>
<p>people to be a certain way and they&rsquo;re fucking not like they&rsquo;re mad weird and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t respect their self or they&rsquo;re actually fucking dumb like a</p>
<p>psychiatrist like what are you fucking doing weirdo why are you taking advantage</p>
<p>of little fucking I want to say little kids but like 20 year olds are fucking</p>
<p>children in my mind if someone is in their 40s and they&rsquo;re trying to fuck</p>
<p>with someone that&rsquo;s in their 20s they got some shit wrong with them I am</p>
<p>someone who used to fuck with people in their 40s since I&rsquo;m damn 18 so I have</p>
<p>plenty of experience with these people and they lack serious mental capacity</p>
<p>like they lack so much emotional development and like mental anything</p>
<p>like they have shit wrong with them and that can be an entire episode where I</p>
<p>unpack that but bro like these people should not be doing this fucking shit</p>
<p>people that are young do not have the mental armor and the mental maturity and</p>
<p>the knowledge yet to be able to protect their self from someone that is older so</p>
<p>for you to be going at someone that&rsquo;s 20 when you&rsquo;re fucking like 45 that is</p>
<p>weird that is fucking strange that you see something that can&rsquo;t really protect</p>
<p>itself mentally they&rsquo;re easily manipulated like you have so much</p>
<p>knowledge they don&rsquo;t have that like it&rsquo;s not fair so the fact that that</p>
<p>turns you on you have some serious fucking control dynamic issues you have</p>
<p>some issues with power you got a lot of shadow work to fucking do all right and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking predator with a victim mentality and I can read that shit right</p>
<p>through your face I guess it&rsquo;s just my expectations like what I assume comes</p>
<p>with certain roles or types of achievements I don&rsquo;t know like I just</p>
<p>expect people with a lot of money to behave a certain way and when they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you or I expect certain people with certain titles to behave a certain</p>
<p>way and I&rsquo;m like you what are you doing another example is people in</p>
<p>relationships I expect certain respect to be like there but like between the</p>
<p>couple like I know I joked about this in a tick-tock but I really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>joking when I said for someone that&rsquo;s in a relationship like two guys are dating</p>
<p>and one of them follows me on Instagram I don&rsquo;t like that shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disrespectful to their fucking partner like why are you following a boy that</p>
<p>you find attractive you&rsquo;re in a fucking relationship what the fuck are you doing</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that like that shit stresses me out because I know if I was</p>
<p>dating a guy and he was out following other guys I&rsquo;m beating you the fuck up</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m literally like I said in my tick-tock when you walk through the door</p>
<p>put your hands up I&rsquo;m fucking swinging on you on-site bitch as soon as I see</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;m knocking you the fuck out for that disrespectful fucking shit okay</p>
<p>like no I&rsquo;m very big on disrespect and I&rsquo;m very sensitive to it so people that</p>
<p>do that type shit like I have certain expectations for everyone that&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>relationship and when they don&rsquo;t match that like it makes me uncomfortable</p>
<p>another example is open relationships people that an open relationships that</p>
<p>could never be me if it works for you I&rsquo;m happy for you go do it but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dynamic I personally can never understand I&rsquo;m too insecure I&rsquo;m too</p>
<p>territorial I&rsquo;m too everything under the fucking Sun that&rsquo;s against that shit</p>
<p>that it could never work for me like cuz if I see you enjoying being with someone</p>
<p>sexually that&rsquo;s not me and we&rsquo;re supposed to be together I&rsquo;m biting</p>
<p>something off all right whether it&rsquo;s a limb or your fucking dick I&rsquo;m biting</p>
<p>something off of you because like no no it&rsquo;s gonna hurt my feelings we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do that okay on to my next realization and it&rsquo;s about social media</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really judge people off of their social media whether they have a</p>
<p>lot of followers or not because certain people don&rsquo;t put effort into having an</p>
<p>online persona and like putting their self online so someone like me I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken the time and put in the effort to make videos and to create a tik-tok</p>
<p>account and have an Instagram like I&rsquo;m putting in the effort to make a presence</p>
<p>for myself online but I&rsquo;ve met so many people who are so fucking cool in real</p>
<p>life that have no social media none so just because someone doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>followers or they don&rsquo;t have much posted it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re lame like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably really fucking cool but I just realized like not everybody online is</p>
<p>everybody online there&rsquo;s so many people in real life that shit on the people</p>
<p>online like they like the people online are such losers compared to the people</p>
<p>in real life with no social media I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s everybody but like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before and I will die on this hill social media makes people that are</p>
<p>fucking nobodies think they&rsquo;re somebody but a lot of somebodies are not on</p>
<p>social media and we kind of forget that we forget that it&rsquo;s not just the same</p>
<p>fruitcakes we keep seeing online and one example is like the blue-haired bitches</p>
<p>okay and what I mean by the blue-haired bitches are the ones that are like very</p>
<p>one way in their views and they&rsquo;re there the they them&rsquo;s and all that shit I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck about pronouns call yourself what you want but don&rsquo;t get mad</p>
<p>at me because I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you are okay like bitch you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what the fuck you are changing your goddamn pronouns every other day that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different topic but my point with the blue-haired bitches that&rsquo;s just what I</p>
<p>call them that&rsquo;s all you see online typically like you never see someone</p>
<p>with another opinion because they&rsquo;ll be canceled if they fucking speak of</p>
<p>anything other than what these little blue-haired bitches have to say so when</p>
<p>all you see is like online shit for a while you&rsquo;ll start to think everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that and then when you go out in real life and you see that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>opposing opinions they&rsquo;re just not spoken online you&rsquo;ll realize you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>as alone and the things that you think and like social media just kind of has a</p>
<p>way of getting you convinced that that is reality when it&rsquo;s not social media</p>
<p>and everything on your physical phone and behind the screen is not reality it</p>
<p>feels real because it looks similar it&rsquo;s just a big mindfuck and I catch</p>
<p>myself a lot and I have to remind myself that&rsquo;s not all that there is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more out there like there&rsquo;s way more information than what is online but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just in real life like that&rsquo;s not all that there is that&rsquo;s not all the people</p>
<p>that are there that&rsquo;s not all the potential friends you can make and</p>
<p>people you can date and information you can learn and jobs you can have because</p>
<p>if you do a job search it&rsquo;s limited there&rsquo;s not really it&rsquo;s not gonna tell</p>
<p>you all of the possible jobs that actually are there it&rsquo;s like their</p>
<p>search results and the shit you have access to online is limited I know it</p>
<p>seems weird because the internet is so vast and it&rsquo;s so big and there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>possibility but what you&rsquo;re limited to seeing it&rsquo;s insane like you don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>all that there is one online or two that there is in real life like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much more in real life than you fucking realize and I have to remember</p>
<p>that I have to remind myself of that constantly but like people to learn from</p>
<p>if you could try to go learn about finances or stocks or anything if you go</p>
<p>google it or go on YouTube you&rsquo;re gonna run across the same like four or five</p>
<p>fruitcakes talking about these topics there&rsquo;s just this certain handful of</p>
<p>every like demographic and topic you can think of and it&rsquo;s the same few people</p>
<p>making the same fucking shit with the same stupid ass tips over and over again</p>
<p>you can only learn so much from these people but it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being shown you&rsquo;re not shown the smaller creators that have a lot of useful shit</p>
<p>to say because there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the mental health space and the</p>
<p>self-development space that don&rsquo;t say shit compared to what I say and I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as like professional with it and I say fuck and I give personal</p>
<p>experiences and I give it to you the way it is and they&rsquo;re all a lot more</p>
<p>professional with it but the shit I say makes more of an impact in my opinion</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re marketed like they are they have a whole teams to make them blow up</p>
<p>and advertise them and make them like appeal to the right audience the</p>
<p>audience that I&rsquo;m gonna appeal to is very small so like people are not gonna</p>
<p>find me I don&rsquo;t have a team promoting me to be found so it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m one of the</p>
<p>people that if you don&rsquo;t know about me you&rsquo;re not gonna know what I have to say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna think that there&rsquo;s only people like fucking Jay Shetty and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stupid ass shit that they post oh my god can you hear cat hi honey you</p>
<p>want attention I know here I&rsquo;ll put you see she wanted attention she came and</p>
<p>found me she&rsquo;s the fucking star of the show with this one but yeah the</p>
<p>information you can find online is kind of limited because I know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole algorithm shit and then there&rsquo;s like filters on search results</p>
<p>and everything you do and say and watch is being tracked you just don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only being shown certain things that are the most profitable for the</p>
<p>companies that provide what you&rsquo;re looking at so you&rsquo;re not seeing the</p>
<p>truth of what&rsquo;s actually there the only way you can see the truth of like what</p>
<p>you need to know and what can actually help you is in real life and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying everything because there is a lot of useful information and good resources</p>
<p>online but you need to get out in real life you need to like you need to remind</p>
<p>yourself that that is a resource real life is a resource for everything you</p>
<p>need want and could desire people have been doing it without social media for</p>
<p>fucking centuries and we&rsquo;re over here the first generation with social media</p>
<p>and we are beyond fucked up like it helps in a lot of ways but this is just</p>
<p>my little reminder that there&rsquo;s so much more to life than you see on your phone</p>
<p>okay so my final realization for this episode so I&rsquo;m the type person that I</p>
<p>like to plan for things I like to prepare I don&rsquo;t like to be caught off</p>
<p>guard I don&rsquo;t like for plans to change I like when something is set it&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>this way like so if we agree on something it&rsquo;s gonna go this way and if</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t go the way that I planned for I get fucking pissed like I get</p>
<p>actively physically fucking mad but I just recently had something happen where</p>
<p>I agreed to do something with people and it got changed like the plans got</p>
<p>changed and I got extremely fucking mad and I was by myself so I like sat down</p>
<p>with myself and I tried to figure it out like I was trying to understand why is</p>
<p>this so hurtful like why is something not going the way that I planned for it</p>
<p>to go so fucking hurtful and I realized there&rsquo;s a lot of things that I made the</p>
<p>situation mean and I definitely want to do a full podcast on the meanings you</p>
<p>assign to things but I revealed that what I was telling myself in my brain</p>
<p>subconsciously was I&rsquo;m stupid for even trying to plan or hope for it to go good</p>
<p>or go right like I was telling myself I was fucking dumb and then I was telling</p>
<p>myself the effort that I put in to prepare was worthless it was pointless</p>
<p>and then that everything just went wrong so something went wrong so those are the</p>
<p>main things that I was telling myself so that I&rsquo;m stupid for even hoping it could</p>
<p>go right the work I did to prepare was worthless and pointless and I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>fucking idiot for even doing it and that the situation not going the way I</p>
<p>planned for it meant that things were going wrong and something was working</p>
<p>against me basically so then I got the chance to look at each of those things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like okay let&rsquo;s back the fuck up like I have to like check myself all the</p>
<p>time so when I decided I wanted to do something I wanted to plan for it</p>
<p>planning is smart planning is not stupid having something that you want to do and</p>
<p>then doing things and thinking of things to help make sure this process goes as</p>
<p>smooth as possible is very smart so that immediately invalidated that belief I had</p>
<p>so I let that one fucking go because it doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m stupid because the</p>
<p>plan didn&rsquo;t go how I wanted it to I was actually being smart it just didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>that way that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything about me and this kind of goes back to</p>
<p>the cat thing making shit mean something about you so making it mean that my</p>
<p>planning was worthless is the second one how I went through that one and kind of</p>
<p>like deconstructed that was I&rsquo;m someone that cannot do something without</p>
<p>planning a little bit or thinking ahead a tiny bit so if I agree I&rsquo;m gonna go to</p>
<p>a concert or go on a trip I plan for it that helps alleviate my anxiety it makes</p>
<p>me feel like I have a little bit of a sense of control I know what to expect</p>
<p>some sort because I don&rsquo;t like the unknown so planning for me helps me feel</p>
<p>safe secure and like comfortable to go forward with it because if I didn&rsquo;t plan</p>
<p>I would just be sitting there an anxious fucking wreck hoping shit just like went</p>
<p>right but planning helps me alleviate that anxiety so my effort to plan was</p>
<p>not worthless because it made me feel better like the effort that I put in to</p>
<p>plan for this thing I can still use a lot of what I planned for but I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a situation where I plan for something and then everything I did</p>
<p>literally is useless and I can&rsquo;t use it it&rsquo;s still not useless because it helped</p>
<p>me feel better in that moment it made me feel better to plan for this thing</p>
<p>versus just sitting there and doing nothing so it wasn&rsquo;t worthless and then</p>
<p>my last thought about the experience not going the way I wanted it to and the</p>
<p>way that I planned for it to meant that something went wrong or that something</p>
<p>is working against me so holding that belief is gonna hurt the fuck out of me</p>
<p>like I see where my frustration came from with all this I see it and then</p>
<p>reworking all these beliefs is what made me feel better so with assuming that it</p>
<p>meant something was going wrong I had to get very objective I&rsquo;m like okay so what</p>
<p>just happened on a black-and-white straight-up strategic like analytical</p>
<p>standpoint what just happened I plan for something to go this way and it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>does that right there in that moment mean something went wrong no something</p>
<p>changed so I had to go catch my assumption that I threw on top of that</p>
<p>which was a change I made it mean that something went wrong just because it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go my way and the way that I thought it would go and the way that I</p>
<p>hoped it would go it does not mean something went wrong and then I was</p>
<p>looking at it like okay so if something went wrong that means something is</p>
<p>working against me like God for fucking bit I try to do something to make myself</p>
<p>happy or to have a good experience like God for fucking bid right so I went down</p>
<p>that whole rabbit hole of emotion so I ended up at a crossroad and I faced the</p>
<p>decision I can look at this from the standpoint of something is working</p>
<p>against me or seeing how this could be happening for me and in that moment I</p>
<p>got to choose I have nothing to go off of with how to see if something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening for me like I have no way to I can&rsquo;t just sit here and tell myself this</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s happening for me but I can open myself up to seeing how it is happening</p>
<p>for me because I&rsquo;m the type person I&rsquo;m very like real I&rsquo;m not what&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>to just say some bullshit affirmation y&rsquo;all know that I&rsquo;m not just gonna be</p>
<p>like oh no something&rsquo;s not working against me it&rsquo;s happening for me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like no how is it happening for me I&rsquo;m opening my eyes up and I&rsquo;m opening</p>
<p>myself up to seeing the ways that this just changed for my benefit I lined up</p>
<p>with this realization because this happened the way that it did so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing but by going into this I realized I faced the choice of I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>the crossroad and now I&rsquo;m gonna go down the road of seeing how it happened for</p>
<p>me because I already just went down the road of how it happened against me and</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t feel good I didn&rsquo;t fucking like that so now I&rsquo;m trying out the</p>
<p>other route and it completely alters my perspective of this experience because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna go but I no longer I&rsquo;m holding the belief of something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working against me so neck if there is another hiccup or another inconvenience</p>
<p>or something else changes with this experience I&rsquo;m not gonna immediately be</p>
<p>triggered and pissed off and get angry thinking something is working against me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m walking down the road of seeing how this is happening for me and I kind of</p>
<p>translated into my whole life but I&rsquo;m just gonna keep it there with this</p>
<p>situation but you get my point all right are you tired yet because I</p>
<p>feel like that&rsquo;s a lot of realizations to throw at you if you like this podcast</p>
<p>make sure to leave it a 5-star rating whether you&rsquo;re on Apple podcast or</p>
<p>Spotify you could leave me a 5-star rating on either one I will also leave</p>
