<p>so if you&rsquo;re new here hi</p>
<p>every monday i sit down and i talk</p>
<p>about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>noggin and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button okay</p>
<p>kitty cats we have a long</p>
<p>story today</p>
<p>and a lot of</p>
<p>the times it&rsquo;s really difficult to find information</p>
<p>about a case but</p>
<p>with this story</p>
<p>you see there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much information out there there&rsquo;s just too much</p>
<p>and it was like oh</p>
<p>crap grab a</p>
<p>snack for sure it&rsquo;s a long one</p>
<p>there are two people</p>
<p>that i get requested</p>
<p>to do a murder mystery makeup</p>
<p>about the most</p>
<p>one ted bundy and two</p>
<p>jeffrey dahmer</p>
<p>you know and i get it</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re very popular serial killers</p>
<p>i have to give the people what they</p>
<p>want and you guys have been asking for one of these</p>
<p>so i thought okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do it for you so</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m going to be talking</p>
<p>about jeffrey dahmer</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s jump</p>
<p>right into it i will just</p>
<p>stop rambling and get</p>
<p>right into it</p>
<p>okay jeff jeffrey</p>
<p>mr dahmer let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>so jeffrey was born in milwaukee</p>
<p>wisconsin i would definitely say and</p>
<p>maybe you can agree</p>
<p>at least if you&rsquo;re from the united</p>
<p>states when you hear milwaukee</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry but we think of jeffrey dahmer</p>
<p>a lot of us do i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he was born may 21st</p>
<p>1960 it has been</p>
<p>claimed that jeff</p>
<p>was deprived of attention as an infant but</p>
<p>other sources suggest that the family was super close</p>
<p>and gave lots of love and attention to jeff</p>
<p>and that they were like this perfect little family</p>
<p>but when you kind of look up to</p>
<p>just how the family was</p>
<p>growing up for jeffrey</p>
<p>it seems like each family member had something else</p>
<p>say like the mom and the dad both</p>
<p>apparently had different</p>
<p>experiences they thought it was</p>
<p>everything was great fine and dandy</p>
<p>the kids are like</p>
<p>this was a very toxic</p>
<p>household they were fighting all the time now jeff</p>
<p>would say that his</p>
<p>mother was very tense</p>
<p>she was greedy</p>
<p>she constantly wanted attention</p>
<p>and was always in arguments with her husband when he</p>
<p>entered first grade his</p>
<p>mother her name is joyce she wasn&rsquo;t doing well she</p>
<p>spent a lot</p>
<p>of her time in bed and she was struggling with</p>
<p>depression she also</p>
<p>was feeling very weak and</p>
<p>tired all the time</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to want to give any type of attention towards her kids</p>
<p>which is sad</p>
<p>and then jeff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>father he spent a lot of time</p>
<p>away from home he was attending</p>
<p>university so he</p>
<p>could get a degree in chemistry</p>
<p>he was a really</p>
<p>smart cookie so he wasn&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>a lot because he was trying to get a degree so he</p>
<p>could get a good job and take care of the family and</p>
<p>honestly just</p>
<p>you know how it goes if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to school and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a lot</p>
<p>now it said when jeff&rsquo;s dad was home</p>
<p>his wife demanded constant attention from him</p>
<p>he really didn&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>spend a lot of time with his children</p>
<p>jeff recalled his</p>
<p>early years of family</p>
<p>life as being extremely</p>
<p>tense because he</p>
<p>would see his</p>
<p>mother and father</p>
<p>constantly arguing with one another and then</p>
<p>sadly on one occasion</p>
<p>joyce the mom</p>
<p>she attempted suicide</p>
<p>she survived</p>
<p>but neither</p>
<p>parent really devoted</p>
<p>much time to</p>
<p>their son now jeff was described as being a</p>
<p>happy energetic</p>
<p>child up until the</p>
<p>age of four and i</p>
<p>guess at the</p>
<p>age of four</p>
<p>he had to go in</p>
<p>and have surgery</p>
<p>to correct a double hernia</p>
<p>it said after that surgery is when</p>
<p>he seemed to</p>
<p>change he just wasn&rsquo;t the same he wasn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>happy he seemed to kind of just be</p>
<p>meh at elementary</p>
<p>school he was both</p>
<p>quiet and pretty timid</p>
<p>on his first</p>
<p>grade report card one</p>
<p>teacher described jeffrey</p>
<p>as a reserved</p>
<p>child this teacher did</p>
<p>note that she felt like he was being neglected at home</p>
<p>but like nothing really</p>
<p>came from it it was just kind of noted in the paperwork</p>
<p>so from an early</p>
<p>age mr dahmer he had an interest</p>
<p>in dead animals</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry dead animals</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i said it like that now friends</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>initially he</p>
<p>would collect</p>
<p>large insects</p>
<p>like dragonflies and butterflies and he</p>
<p>would place</p>
<p>these inside of jars</p>
<p>and then he upgraded</p>
<p>to collecting roadkill</p>
<p>off the streets</p>
<p>so a big jump</p>
<p>we went from butterflies</p>
<p>dragonflies</p>
<p>to roadkill</p>
<p>but jeffrey</p>
<p>would say you know he was a very curious cat</p>
<p>okay road kill</p>
<p>was an easy way to</p>
<p>kind of they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already dead you know so he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna take these dead animals take them back to the</p>
<p>house there was a little a woodshed</p>
<p>in the backyard</p>
<p>he would dismember the animals his reason was that</p>
<p>he was curious as to</p>
<p>what was inside</p>
<p>of these animals what did it look like</p>
<p>he wanted to know so he</p>
<p>would dissect animals</p>
<p>he would put them in</p>
<p>mason jars and he</p>
<p>would either</p>
<p>leave them in the tool shed or</p>
<p>he would just</p>
<p>leave them in the wooded area in</p>
<p>their backyard so he&rsquo;d go back there</p>
<p>sometimes he</p>
<p>would dismember animals back there so nobody</p>
<p>would see him obviously</p>
<p>and sometimes he</p>
<p>would just go there to kind of leave</p>
<p>stuff he knew he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave in the tool shed</p>
<p>but god that probably had a</p>
<p>stink right</p>
<p>all i can think</p>
<p>about like how bad he probably smelled</p>
<p>which is mean</p>
<p>is it no because it&rsquo;s probably true he probably stunk</p>
<p>sir you stink you</p>
<p>smell like roadkill you know</p>
<p>like now jeff</p>
<p>would tell his friends that</p>
<p>he was just curious how all of</p>
<p>these animals fit together</p>
<p>oh i am so sorry i forgot to add a disclaimer</p>
<p>disclaimer this</p>
<p>includes just a lot of</p>
<p>awful things and</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to talk</p>
<p>about a dog</p>
<p>so if any of this bothers you</p>
<p>or makes you uncomfortable please exit out of the video</p>
<p>there will always be next week</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>includes just</p>
<p>everything rape</p>
<p>murder sexual assault</p>
<p>just all bad</p>
<p>and animals</p>
<p>as well so i so</p>
<p>greatly apologize</p>
<p>so there was one occasion that at</p>
<p>least we know of there was a dog that got hit by a car</p>
<p>and it was left on the side of the</p>
<p>street so jeff was like hey cool like</p>
<p>dog i&rsquo;m gonna go get it so he goes and he gets the dog</p>
<p>he brings it back with him to the</p>
<p>house now he goes back</p>
<p>into the like the tool shed area or his backyard he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bring it into his actual like family</p>
<p>house and at this time</p>
<p>like his parents</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t home</p>
<p>so he could get away with</p>
<p>these things i</p>
<p>guess without getting caught anyway so he takes this</p>
<p>dog he cuts the head off</p>
<p>of the dog and then he decides to nail</p>
<p>the dog&rsquo;s body to a tree he then took the dog&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skull he cleaned it up and</p>
<p>okay so he got all of the dog hair off and</p>
<p>stuff he took it out to the wooded area behind his home</p>
<p>he put the skull on a wooden</p>
<p>cross kind of through the skull</p>
<p>do you know what i&rsquo;m saying i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what he was doing you guys he was just doing it jeez</p>
<p>so in nineteen</p>
<p>sixty six the family</p>
<p>ended up moving to doylestown</p>
<p>ohio and during this time joyce</p>
<p>jeff&rsquo;s mom she</p>
<p>was pregnant with their</p>
<p>second child</p>
<p>and she gave</p>
<p>birth to a baby boy</p>
<p>and she allowed</p>
<p>jeffrey to pick</p>
<p>out the name of his new brother so he picked the name</p>
<p>david and then in 1968 the family</p>
<p>moved to bath</p>
<p>ohio two years</p>
<p>later over a family dinner they were eating chicken</p>
<p>jeff asked his father what</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>if the bones of the chicken were to be placed</p>
<p>in bleach solution</p>
<p>and at this time his father</p>
<p>was he was kind of</p>
<p>worried for his son because he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t very social he didn&rsquo;t seem to have many friends</p>
<p>he could tell his son was just awkward and weird</p>
<p>but when jeff</p>
<p>asked this question</p>
<p>his father said that he was delighted at the</p>
<p>initiative displayed by his son</p>
<p>towards what he believed to be</p>
<p>scientific curiosity he</p>
<p>willingly showed his son</p>
<p>how to safely bleach</p>
<p>and later preserve</p>
<p>animal bones his dad jeff&rsquo;s dad was</p>
<p>thinking you know father son</p>
<p>bone bonding time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m showing my son</p>
<p>how to do what i do</p>
<p>essentially like or what i know best because</p>
<p>he was a chemist</p>
<p>and he thought</p>
<p>jeff was just showing interest in his profession</p>
<p>which he was</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>so during high</p>
<p>school many of his</p>
<p>classmates said that he</p>
<p>would bring beer or hard liquor to</p>
<p>school he would</p>
<p>smuggle it inside the lining of his jacket</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would hide it in his locker jeff</p>
<p>would drink before</p>
<p>during and then sometimes even</p>
<p>after school</p>
<p>and this all</p>
<p>started when</p>
<p>he was fourteen years old now when jeff reached</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it said that he discovered</p>
<p>that he was gay</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t tell his parents</p>
<p>about this because</p>
<p>i mean they didn&rsquo;t even have the best relationship why</p>
<p>would he tell his parents</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s said that he did engage in a</p>
<p>brief relationship</p>
<p>with another boy</p>
<p>jeff said that&rsquo;s when he began</p>
<p>to sexually fantasize</p>
<p>about dominating and controlling a</p>
<p>submissive male partner</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>started you know</p>
<p>teenage boys</p>
<p>i hear that they just are like really</p>
<p>horny which is</p>
<p>gross i shouldn&rsquo;t say that but like that&rsquo;s what i hear</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where he was at in life</p>
<p>by 1977 jeff his grades</p>
<p>they were declining okay he wasn&rsquo;t doing well</p>
<p>and he said it was because of the alcohol</p>
<p>well no shit</p>
<p>so during this time also his parents</p>
<p>their relationship was just getting worse</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>going to try counseling</p>
<p>marriage counseling to try and save</p>
<p>their marriage because</p>
<p>they wasn&rsquo;t looking</p>
<p>looking too good for them</p>
<p>marriage counseling didn&rsquo;t work for them</p>
<p>and they decided to just get a divorce</p>
<p>jeff&rsquo;s dad thought it</p>
<p>would be best if he</p>
<p>moved out of the home</p>
<p>and then in may of 1978 jeff</p>
<p>graduated from high school</p>
<p>and shortly</p>
<p>after joyce</p>
<p>she was awarded</p>
<p>custody of her</p>
<p>younger son</p>
<p>she ended up vacating the family residence</p>
<p>or the family home</p>
<p>and she moved in with family members of hers</p>
<p>she left jeff by himself at the family home</p>
<p>so he was living there by himself for a</p>
<p>minute which</p>
<p>not good when he&rsquo;s eighteen</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think if you</p>
<p>leave an eighteen year old at the home by himself</p>
<p>what do you think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>productive yeah</p>
<p>no jeff had just</p>
<p>turned eighteen in that time like he was considered</p>
<p>legally an adult</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s living on his own in the family home on june</p>
<p>eighteenth nineteen</p>
<p>seventy eight</p>
<p>was driving home</p>
<p>and he noticed a hitchhiker</p>
<p>it was just four days</p>
<p>shy of his 19th birthday</p>
<p>he sees this hitchhiker</p>
<p>hitchhiker is a</p>
<p>young man and he</p>
<p>kind of cute</p>
<p>so jeff pulls</p>
<p>over and ask hey do you want to come over to my</p>
<p>place i have a few beers we</p>
<p>could just hang out like no big deal like i got the</p>
<p>house to myself</p>
<p>so jeff and the hitchhiker they go back to his</p>
<p>house they were</p>
<p>drinking they were listening to</p>
<p>music and he felt like he</p>
<p>like had a new friend</p>
<p>right i guess this hitchhiker finally got to a</p>
<p>point where he&rsquo;s like okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready to go home now</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>ready to leave i</p>
<p>wanna leave this</p>
<p>upset jeffrey</p>
<p>and i know it</p>
<p>it upset him because</p>
<p>instead of just like letting him go home</p>
<p>instead jeffrey was like you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna grab this ten</p>
<p>pound dumbbell</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna hit him in the head with it</p>
<p>so he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave solid plan</p>
<p>he grabs a 10</p>
<p>pound dumbbell</p>
<p>and he hits</p>
<p>this poor man</p>
<p>twice from behind in the head</p>
<p>while he was</p>
<p>this victim was sitting in a chair</p>
<p>after he hit him he then</p>
<p>strangled the poor man</p>
<p>until he died once jeffrey</p>
<p>knew that this</p>
<p>victim was dead</p>
<p>he then removed all of his</p>
<p>clothing and then he said that he</p>
<p>stood over the</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s body and masturbated</p>
<p>over his body</p>
<p>according to jeff this was like his</p>
<p>first time killing somebody</p>
<p>he was feeling</p>
<p>all sorts of ways</p>
<p>excited aroused</p>
<p>the next day jeff had this dead body</p>
<p>in his house</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i gotta do something</p>
<p>with this he takes the body down to his basement</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>he takes apart the</p>
<p>whole body like like</p>
<p>just takes it up like what</p>
<p>what are you doing he just takes it all</p>
<p>apart and then jeff grabs a</p>
<p>shovel dig a</p>
<p>grave in his backyard</p>
<p>because he needs somewhere to put the remains</p>
<p>so he puts the remains</p>
<p>in his own backyard several weeks went</p>
<p>by jeff decided to dig up the body cut it up somewhere</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going through his mind i really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing so he digs up the remains</p>
<p>he takes a knife</p>
<p>okay he cuts the</p>
<p>flesh from the bones</p>
<p>and then remember his dad showed him how to</p>
<p>dissolve flesh from bones so</p>
<p>he can preserve the bones well he used that technique</p>
<p>he got some acid</p>
<p>he soaks the body in this acid</p>
<p>to try and get all of the flesh</p>
<p>and the meat and</p>
<p>everything off of the bones he wants to</p>
<p>keep them or something</p>
<p>takes the acid solution he</p>
<p>flushes it down the toilet then jeff</p>
<p>crushes up the bones</p>
<p>he then scatters</p>
<p>them in the wooded area behind the family home also</p>
<p>this is a side note just really</p>
<p>quickly i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>naming any of the</p>
<p>victims i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna be referring to them as victim</p>
<p>reason being is because family members of</p>
<p>the victims</p>
<p>have sued different people who have</p>
<p>written books</p>
<p>or made movies and</p>
<p>stuff and like</p>
<p>named the victims they sued</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t give permission</p>
<p>their family members name to be used to protect</p>
<p>myself and then also the vic</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>never mind i won&rsquo;t get into it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not me trying to be disrespectful by any means</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>upset anybody</p>
<p>so that is um</p>
<p>was jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first kill and he was</p>
<p>excited about it</p>
<p>it really got him</p>
<p>going he was like oh hell yeah killing</p>
<p>i think i like this you know i</p>
<p>wanna try it again</p>
<p>six weeks ago by jeff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>father has found a new love you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a new girl and actually a new fiance i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>and they end up</p>
<p>going by the old house</p>
<p>see like how jeff is doing to go</p>
<p>check in with him and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they discovered that jeff was living alone the</p>
<p>whole time he thought like he was living with his mom</p>
<p>he had no idea that he was just living on his own</p>
<p>his father thought it</p>
<p>would be best if</p>
<p>jeffrey went to college</p>
<p>did something</p>
<p>productive with himself in his life</p>
<p>and he actually offered</p>
<p>to pay for his</p>
<p>schooling he</p>
<p>ended up attending ohio</p>
<p>state university</p>
<p>while attending the university</p>
<p>he received a</p>
<p>whopping gpa</p>
<p>score of 0 45</p>
<p>how do you achieve that i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>had paid for</p>
<p>his schooling in advance okay</p>
<p>jeffrey thought it&rsquo;d be best if he</p>
<p>dropped out of university</p>
<p>and he only attended for</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>waste of money</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>again is trying to help his son trying to find him</p>
<p>some kind of purpose in life</p>
<p>right so he&rsquo;s telling jeffrey you</p>
<p>should definitely enlist</p>
<p>in the us army</p>
<p>jeffrey agrees and he ends up enlisting in the us army</p>
<p>and he actually</p>
<p>trained as a medical</p>
<p>specialist in san antonio</p>
<p>texas and then in july 1979</p>
<p>he was stationed in west</p>
<p>texas germany</p>
<p>where he served as a combat medic</p>
<p>how did you get that job you know like according to</p>
<p>published reports in his</p>
<p>first year of service he was a quote</p>
<p>average or slightly</p>
<p>above average soldier</p>
<p>quote two soldiers</p>
<p>would later attest</p>
<p>to having been</p>
<p>raped by jeffrey</p>
<p>while in the army</p>
<p>one stated in</p>
<p>2010 so years and years</p>
<p>later that jeff</p>
<p>had repeatedly</p>
<p>raped him over a 17</p>
<p>month period</p>
<p>while they were both stationed in germany</p>
<p>while another soldier believed that jeff</p>
<p>had drugged and raped him</p>
<p>in 1979 in march of 1981 jeff</p>
<p>was deemed unsuitable</p>
<p>for military service</p>
<p>and was discharged from the army because of his</p>
<p>alcohol abuse he was sent to</p>
<p>south carolina for debriefing</p>
<p>and he also was provided with the</p>
<p>plane ticket to</p>
<p>travel anywhere in the country</p>
<p>so you know if you</p>
<p>could go anywhere in the country like</p>
<p>where would you go oh my gosh you know</p>
<p>jeffrey was like well i know i can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>home because if i have to tell my dad that i failed at</p>
<p>everything like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do that he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to florida</p>
<p>miami beach</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s like yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do it so he goes down to florida he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>his dad he moves to florida and he actually</p>
<p>found work at a</p>
<p>local restaurant</p>
<p>and he rented a room</p>
<p>in a nearby</p>
<p>motel now jeffrey</p>
<p>would spend most of his income on alcohol and</p>
<p>sadly he got</p>
<p>evicted from the motel</p>
<p>he was living at</p>
<p>for not paying</p>
<p>once he got kicked out</p>
<p>he just kind of really was left</p>
<p>with nowhere to go and he was feeling very defeated</p>
<p>and he ends up calling up his dad and asking if he</p>
<p>could come back to ohio he moves in with his father and</p>
<p>his new stepmother</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>like any parent does they give you chores okay</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like we have to make sure that jeffrey</p>
<p>is like staying busy or what he can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>freeloader in my home so they gave him</p>
<p>lots of different chores to do around</p>
<p>the home they heavily pushed him to go find a job so</p>
<p>he would spend</p>
<p>a lot of his days out and</p>
<p>about just looking</p>
<p>for work and then when he was home he</p>
<p>would just follow the</p>
<p>rules he was doing the chores trying his best i guess</p>
<p>now at this time he was</p>
<p>still drinking a ton</p>
<p>he would be arrested for</p>
<p>drunk and disorderly conduct</p>
<p>and he was fined 60</p>
<p>bucks and given</p>
<p>a suspended 10 day jail sentence</p>
<p>his father couldn&rsquo;t help him</p>
<p>when it came to his</p>
<p>drinking jeffrey&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>had enough he was like i am done with you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking a lot</p>
<p>bedroom floor was just</p>
<p>covered with</p>
<p>empty bottles</p>
<p>and he tells jeffrey</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go live with your</p>
<p>grandmother and anna west</p>
<p>alice wisconsin</p>
<p>so yeah his dad&rsquo;s like go live with your</p>
<p>grandmother okay</p>
<p>because i just can&rsquo;t take you anymore do you</p>
<p>blame him no</p>
<p>well now his</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>was the only family member</p>
<p>who showed any love and affection towards jeffrey</p>
<p>he loved his grandma</p>
<p>and when he went to go live with her</p>
<p>as he did it did help him change</p>
<p>things up a bit</p>
<p>and he seemed a little bit more happier</p>
<p>he would attend</p>
<p>church with his grandma</p>
<p>he would help around the</p>
<p>house on things like</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t really do and he even</p>
<p>found a job at the milwaukee</p>
<p>blood plasma center</p>
<p>fitting but it seemed</p>
<p>like he was doing better</p>
<p>and he was able to keep that job for ten months</p>
<p>but then he got laid off</p>
<p>then he remained</p>
<p>unemployed for two years</p>
<p>by late 1985</p>
<p>he had begun to visit</p>
<p>local gay bathhouses</p>
<p>when going to</p>
<p>these bathhouses</p>
<p>he would have sex with different men working there</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>later say that he</p>
<p>would become</p>
<p>really frustrated</p>
<p>at his partners</p>
<p>when he was having sex with them</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>would be moving around</p>
<p>they would be talking too much and</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>he just wanted them to shut up</p>
<p>so instead of just</p>
<p>maybe telling them like hey can you stop talking he</p>
<p>laced their</p>
<p>drinks with crushed</p>
<p>sleeping pills that he would</p>
<p>sneak in there and this</p>
<p>would knock</p>
<p>his victims out they</p>
<p>would pass out</p>
<p>and then while they were passed out jeffrey</p>
<p>would rape them</p>
<p>while they were asleep</p>
<p>he did this</p>
<p>about 12 different times</p>
<p>and then eventually the owners</p>
<p>found out that he was</p>
<p>striking the workers</p>
<p>and they revoked his</p>
<p>membership banned him from coming</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t call the police oh because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a gay bathhouse</p>
<p>oh i answered my own question</p>
<p>but they still</p>
<p>should have called the police or something</p>
<p>right instead of being</p>
<p>upset about this</p>
<p>jeffrey was like you know what this is my opportunity</p>
<p>to just do it on my own i don&rsquo;t need that bathhouse</p>
<p>i could just rent a</p>
<p>hotel room do it on my own terms so</p>
<p>he did on november twentieth nineteen eighty</p>
<p>seven jeff met a</p>
<p>twenty five year old man at a bar</p>
<p>and he asked if he wanted to return</p>
<p>with him to his hotel</p>
<p>and stay with him hang out have some</p>
<p>drinks according to jeffrey</p>
<p>he had absolutely one hundred percent</p>
<p>no intention of murdering</p>
<p>this man okay</p>
<p>but he did intend to just drug and rape him as he lay</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>but not murder him</p>
<p>i was just gonna drug and rape him</p>
<p>like come on following morning though jeffrey wakes up</p>
<p>and when he wakes up he sees that the</p>
<p>victim or the man that he brought home</p>
<p>the night before</p>
<p>he was laying beneath him on the bed</p>
<p>his chest was</p>
<p>crushed in and it was</p>
<p>black and blue with bruises</p>
<p>blood was coming out of the corner of his mouth</p>
<p>and jeffrey&rsquo;s fists and one forearm were</p>
<p>covered in bruises jeff</p>
<p>would say that he had</p>
<p>absolutely no memory of killing</p>
<p>this person and</p>
<p>later told investigators</p>
<p>way later that</p>
<p>he just quote</p>
<p>could not believe that this had happened</p>
<p>and quote i just don&rsquo;t know what happened man</p>
<p>i was just like hanging out i was just</p>
<p>gonna drug and</p>
<p>rape him and i woke up and he was dead so</p>
<p>weird someone</p>
<p>must have came in you know just own up to it you dick</p>
<p>okay tell the</p>
<p>truth i know you&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>remember pepperidge</p>
<p>bar remembers when jeff wakes up and he sees this</p>
<p>victim he&rsquo;s like oh shit</p>
<p>i definitely have to get rid of the body he</p>
<p>decides to purchase a</p>
<p>large suitcase</p>
<p>and he stuffs the body into this suitcase</p>
<p>he ends up taking the body or the suitcase back to his</p>
<p>grandmother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house just leaves the suitcase</p>
<p>unopened he just</p>
<p>leaves it there for</p>
<p>about a week</p>
<p>so once the week goes by</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he decides to open up the suitcase</p>
<p>and dismember the body so he severed</p>
<p>the head the arms the legs the</p>
<p>torso well the legs from the torso</p>
<p>and then he cuts</p>
<p>the flesh from the bones of the body and he cuts the</p>
<p>flesh into a</p>
<p>bunch of different pieces</p>
<p>he places the flesh into</p>
<p>garbage bags</p>
<p>and then wrapped the bones in</p>
<p>paper where</p>
<p>he then used a</p>
<p>sledgehammer to</p>
<p>crush down the bones</p>
<p>so he wraps it in</p>
<p>paper and you</p>
<p>know so it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go everywhere at the bones he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>this in his grandma&rsquo;s basement by the way poor grandma</p>
<p>she has no idea okay so then he disposed</p>
<p>all of the remains except</p>
<p>for the head</p>
<p>and he put all of the remains in the</p>
<p>trash two weeks</p>
<p>later yeah two weeks baby</p>
<p>he was letting</p>
<p>everything marinate i</p>
<p>guess i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>jeff takes the head of the victim</p>
<p>wants to preserve the</p>
<p>skull he really wants the skull</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do what my dad</p>
<p>taught me right to</p>
<p>clean off the meat and</p>
<p>stuff from the bones so he</p>
<p>could preserve</p>
<p>the bones he takes the head</p>
<p>he boils some</p>
<p>water and he puts in a mixture of soil</p>
<p>x and bleach</p>
<p>and soil x is like a</p>
<p>cleaning solution it&rsquo;s pretty powerful</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s doing this in an</p>
<p>effort to retain the</p>
<p>skull now unfortunately for jeff the bleach made the</p>
<p>skull way too brittle</p>
<p>and it it just</p>
<p>completely fell</p>
<p>apart he was</p>
<p>super bombed all that hard work</p>
<p>and he lost the one</p>
<p>thing he really wanted</p>
<p>right so he</p>
<p>threw it away he&rsquo;s determined though</p>
<p>to get another one</p>
<p>jeffrey decides he wants another</p>
<p>victim he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>found his passion in life and he&rsquo;s very passionate</p>
<p>about killing people he</p>
<p>began to actively seek</p>
<p>victims most of them he</p>
<p>would meet in a bar</p>
<p>or close to gay bars</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would ask them to come back to his</p>
<p>place he would drug them</p>
<p>and then once they were passed out he</p>
<p>would have sexual relations with this person</p>
<p>he would rape them let me call it what it is he</p>
<p>would rape them also he</p>
<p>would kill them by strangulation two months</p>
<p>later this one is really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all disturbing but this one is just</p>
<p>whatever okay look</p>
<p>two months later jeff</p>
<p>comes across or meets a</p>
<p>14 year old native american sex worker</p>
<p>first of all there&rsquo;s all sorts of</p>
<p>wrong with that sentence but</p>
<p>like what is a 14 year old</p>
<p>doing working as a sex worker</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sure he was being trafficked</p>
<p>which is just</p>
<p>awful and the fact that he ran into this</p>
<p>this disturbing man mr dahmer</p>
<p>lost his life over it like that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>horseshit and i feel so bad for this poor 14 year old</p>
<p>child like i said in my last video</p>
<p>the lord says we</p>
<p>should forgive</p>
<p>but boy do they make it difficult</p>
<p>anyways 14 year old sex worker</p>
<p>jeff went up to him and was like hey</p>
<p>would you pose for nude pictures</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you 50</p>
<p>bucks just come over to my place</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have sex with me</p>
<p>i just want some nude</p>
<p>photos and i need a</p>
<p>model and you</p>
<p>would be perfect</p>
<p>and this young boy he&rsquo;s like 50</p>
<p>bucks hell yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m there so he agrees</p>
<p>so they go back to his grandma&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place once they get there</p>
<p>actually engage in</p>
<p>sexual intercourse jeffrey ends up drugging him</p>
<p>he crushed up a bunch of</p>
<p>sleeping pills put it in his drink</p>
<p>offered it to him and</p>
<p>just waited</p>
<p>once he passed out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>he strangled him</p>
<p>and he killed him jeffrey</p>
<p>left this young</p>
<p>victim in the basement of his</p>
<p>grandmother&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>for a week and then when he got the chance</p>
<p>he dismembered</p>
<p>and discarded</p>
<p>his body in the</p>
<p>trash except for</p>
<p>again his skull jeffrey</p>
<p>just really wanted a</p>
<p>skull a trophy</p>
<p>jeff does the same</p>
<p>thing but again he made</p>
<p>the bones too brittle</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t work and he had to just</p>
<p>throw away the</p>
<p>skull jeffrey was bummed because like he&rsquo;s like damn it</p>
<p>i really wanted to keep the</p>
<p>skull jeffrey was kind of</p>
<p>experimenting trying to find this</p>
<p>right formula</p>
<p>that way he could</p>
<p>again keep the</p>
<p>skull now on</p>
<p>march 24th 1994</p>
<p>this is a side note just really quickly</p>
<p>have you noticed that like</p>
<p>march kind of seems like to be the month</p>
<p>when a lot of</p>
<p>these things take</p>
<p>place is it just me who&rsquo;s noticing that</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on obviously something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on bailey</p>
<p>march always comes up back to the story</p>
<p>march 24th 1988 jeffrey</p>
<p>now meets a 22 year old man outside of a gay bar</p>
<p>jeff asked hey i&rsquo;ll give you 50</p>
<p>if you just come and hang out with me</p>
<p>the remainder of the</p>
<p>night with me this 22 year old was like</p>
<p>okay they go back to</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house again</p>
<p>same thing drugs him</p>
<p>with a bunch of</p>
<p>sleeping pills</p>
<p>and then once he&rsquo;s passed out he</p>
<p>strangles him with a leather</p>
<p>strap this time though</p>
<p>jeffrey decided that he wanted to perform</p>
<p>oral sex on this</p>
<p>victim and once</p>
<p>he was done</p>
<p>bitch what is he doing</p>
<p>this guy is so fucking</p>
<p>weird this victim though</p>
<p>was dismembered within</p>
<p>twenty four</p>
<p>hours of his murder</p>
<p>this time jeff was quick</p>
<p>about it okay and once</p>
<p>again with the remains he disposed</p>
<p>the bones he</p>
<p>crushed him up</p>
<p>puts him in the</p>
<p>trash keeps the</p>
<p>skull this time though</p>
<p>it said that jeffrey didn&rsquo;t really want this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skull so instead of trying to boil it and keep it he</p>
<p>ended up just</p>
<p>crushing it up</p>
<p>and throwing it away jeffrey</p>
<p>lehner said that</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find this</p>
<p>victim very</p>
<p>attractive and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t really want to keep the skull</p>
<p>so why did he kill him then i</p>
<p>practice i&rsquo;m not sure so many questions</p>
<p>april 23rd jeffrey</p>
<p>lured another</p>
<p>young man to his house</p>
<p>however this time</p>
<p>after giving this victim</p>
<p>drugged coffee</p>
<p>both he and the victim</p>
<p>heard jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grandmother calling down towards him</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re in the basement</p>
<p>his grandma is yelling like jeffrey</p>
<p>is that you</p>
<p>this obviously</p>
<p>freaked him out and he</p>
<p>tried to play it off as if he was there</p>
<p>by himself as if he didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>guest with him</p>
<p>but his grandma</p>
<p>knew that someone</p>
<p>was with him because</p>
<p>she heard she</p>
<p>heard it so</p>
<p>she knew that someone was with him so he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay i can&rsquo;t kill this guy because my grandma knows</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve got someone down here</p>
<p>jeffrey had already drugged this</p>
<p>victim and the</p>
<p>victim was unconscious</p>
<p>so he ends up</p>
<p>carrying him out to the car</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>drives the victim to the county</p>
<p>general hospital just</p>
<p>drops him off</p>
<p>and then leaves that</p>
<p>victim is so</p>
<p>lucky you know in september of 1988</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s grandmother</p>
<p>asked him to move out of her</p>
<p>house because of his</p>
<p>habit of bringing</p>
<p>young men to her home</p>
<p>late at night</p>
<p>and she also said like there&rsquo;s just some really foul</p>
<p>smells coming from both the basement and the garage</p>
<p>and it must be your</p>
<p>stuff i don&rsquo;t like it it&rsquo;s bothering me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like she was so close</p>
<p>to stopping this if she just</p>
<p>would have went down to the basement</p>
<p>we could have</p>
<p>ended this grandma we</p>
<p>could have stopped this</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t and i mean i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame her by any means but you know like so she</p>
<p>asked him to move out he ends up finding a one bedroom</p>
<p>apartment on september</p>
<p>25th he ends up moving out and i&rsquo;m not even kidding you</p>
<p>the next day jeff</p>
<p>was arrested</p>
<p>what was he arrested for</p>
<p>well he actually got caught</p>
<p>he lured a 13 year old boy into his apartment</p>
<p>he drugged the young boy</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>was what&rsquo;s the word</p>
<p>sexually fondling</p>
<p>him he got caught and he was arrested</p>
<p>and then in january of 1989</p>
<p>he was convicted of</p>
<p>second degree</p>
<p>sexual assault</p>
<p>and of enticing a</p>
<p>child for immoral purposes</p>
<p>sentencing for the assault</p>
<p>was suspended until may</p>
<p>of 1989 so a few</p>
<p>months later well i mean i</p>
<p>guess you could say that jeff over here didn&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>too long on his own</p>
<p>literally hours</p>
<p>after moving out on his own he</p>
<p>ended up getting caught and arrested then he</p>
<p>ended up moving</p>
<p>back in with his</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he</p>
<p>would murder his</p>
<p>fifth victim</p>
<p>a 24 year old aspiring</p>
<p>model who he met at a gay bar on</p>
<p>march 25th 1989 once again</p>
<p>according to jeffrey he was not looking to commit a</p>
<p>crime it just</p>
<p>shortly before closing time</p>
<p>this victim just came up and</p>
<p>started talking to him</p>
<p>so jeffrey just you know</p>
<p>asked him if he</p>
<p>wanted to go back to his grandma&rsquo;s home the two of them</p>
<p>ended up engaging in oral sex</p>
<p>and then jeffrey drugged and strangled him</p>
<p>it just happened</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>the following morning he</p>
<p>ended up placing the corpse in his</p>
<p>grandmother&rsquo;s bathtub</p>
<p>where he proceeded to cut up the body he decapitated</p>
<p>the body before</p>
<p>attempting to take the meat off the bones</p>
<p>he stripped the</p>
<p>flesh from the body</p>
<p>he crushed up the bones</p>
<p>he disposed it</p>
<p>again in the</p>
<p>trash he kept</p>
<p>the skull and according to jeff</p>
<p>he found this victim</p>
<p>exceptionally attractive</p>
<p>and was the</p>
<p>first victim</p>
<p>he permanently kept</p>
<p>body parts of</p>
<p>he preserved the</p>
<p>victims head and</p>
<p>lower region</p>
<p>the penis and he put it in acetone</p>
<p>and stored them in his work locker</p>
<p>the following year when he ends up moving he</p>
<p>he took these</p>
<p>these items with him like he was</p>
<p>really like this guy he was something special to jeff</p>
<p>at this time i&rsquo;m so sorry i</p>
<p>failed to mention but jeffrey got a job</p>
<p>prior to his arrest</p>
<p>at a chocolate factory</p>
<p>i know who is he willy wonka</p>
<p>what a creep</p>
<p>not that if you work at a</p>
<p>chocolate factory you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>creep but like this guy is just such a creep</p>
<p>right like he&rsquo;s just fucking creep</p>
<p>so yeah he was working and he was making his own</p>
<p>money and that&rsquo;s how he was able to afford the</p>
<p>apartment on his own in the</p>
<p>first place i apologize</p>
<p>so remember</p>
<p>that time i mentioned that jeff got caught doing</p>
<p>things with a thirteen year old boy</p>
<p>his sentencing was postponed</p>
<p>until may well</p>
<p>may twenty third</p>
<p>nineteen eighty nine that&rsquo;s when his</p>
<p>sentencing takes</p>
<p>place so in my mind i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be in jail for a long time for that right</p>
<p>of course not</p>
<p>jeffrey got five years probation</p>
<p>and he had a work release permit</p>
<p>that way he</p>
<p>could keep his job he also had to register</p>
<p>as a sex offender</p>
<p>but like what the hell does that do</p>
<p>yeah whatever i</p>
<p>guess i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>obsess over it</p>
<p>i let these</p>
<p>things sometimes</p>
<p>make me very</p>
<p>angry because how</p>
<p>could you not get angry</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just so frustrating but</p>
<p>it is what it is bailey</p>
<p>it is what a damn</p>
<p>is so in may</p>
<p>1990 that&rsquo;s when jeff</p>
<p>moved to his own</p>
<p>apartment again</p>
<p>and this time it was</p>
<p>located on north 25th</p>
<p>street in milwaukee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>famous because</p>
<p>all of jeffrey thomas</p>
<p>colt&rsquo;s following followers</p>
<p>know this location well okay</p>
<p>now this apartment was located in a very high</p>
<p>crime area the</p>
<p>apartment was</p>
<p>close to his workplace at the chocolate factory</p>
<p>come on that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny the chocolate</p>
<p>factory and it was furnished so awesome it was 300</p>
<p>dollars per</p>
<p>month for his own</p>
<p>apartment which was a steal</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t care if there was like high</p>
<p>crime or anything he knew he&rsquo;d be just fine</p>
<p>within a week of moving into his new</p>
<p>apartment jeff was</p>
<p>ready to get his</p>
<p>sixth victim</p>
<p>who was a 32 year old</p>
<p>male sex worker jeff had lured</p>
<p>to his apartment</p>
<p>with the promise of 50</p>
<p>for sex he gave the</p>
<p>victim a drink</p>
<p>laced with seven</p>
<p>sleeping pills</p>
<p>and then strangled him the following day jeffrey</p>
<p>had purchased a</p>
<p>polaroid camera</p>
<p>which he took</p>
<p>several pictures</p>
<p>this victim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>in suggestive positions</p>
<p>before dismembering him in the bathroom</p>
<p>he boiled the legs</p>
<p>he boiled the arms</p>
<p>he boiled the</p>
<p>pelvis in a</p>
<p>steel kettle</p>
<p>and then rinsed the bones in his sink</p>
<p>he dissolved the remainder</p>
<p>of the victim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skeleton in a container filled with acid jeffrey</p>
<p>later spray</p>
<p>painted the skull</p>
<p>which she placed</p>
<p>alongside the</p>
<p>skull of the previous fictum</p>
<p>inside a metal</p>
<p>filing cabinet</p>
<p>oh it keeps</p>
<p>going baby so june</p>
<p>1990 jeffrey</p>
<p>lured a 27 year old acquaintance</p>
<p>to his apartment</p>
<p>same shit different day he drugged</p>
<p>strangled he placed the victim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skeleton in his</p>
<p>freezer for several</p>
<p>months in the hope it</p>
<p>would not retain moisture</p>
<p>freezing the skeleton</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t remove</p>
<p>any moisture</p>
<p>and the skeleton of this fictum</p>
<p>would be put in acid</p>
<p>but several</p>
<p>months later</p>
<p>jeffrey accidentally destroyed the skull</p>
<p>when he placed it into</p>
<p>the oven to dry</p>
<p>caused the skull to explode</p>
<p>jeff then met a 22 year old chicago native</p>
<p>and he agreed</p>
<p>to come back to jeffrey&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>jeffrey was like hey if you just come back to my</p>
<p>apartment hang out with me i&rsquo;ll give you 50</p>
<p>so this victim agreed</p>
<p>when they got back to his</p>
<p>place jeffrey</p>
<p>had attempted to perform</p>
<p>oral sex on this victim</p>
<p>but jeff was informed</p>
<p>quote that&rsquo;ll cost you extra</p>
<p>end quote this</p>
<p>obviously pissed</p>
<p>jeffrey off at this time he only had two</p>
<p>sleeping pills left</p>
<p>and he knew that wasn&rsquo;t enough to</p>
<p>knock him out</p>
<p>completely so instead</p>
<p>of knocking this victim out</p>
<p>he just cut his throat</p>
<p>he just went</p>
<p>right for it he did it and</p>
<p>sadly this man</p>
<p>bled to death</p>
<p>jeffrey had just gotten this</p>
<p>polaroid camera remember and he&rsquo;s all excited</p>
<p>about it he&rsquo;s like yeah i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>photographer now so he</p>
<p>poses the victim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>again he poses the body in a very</p>
<p>suggestive way</p>
<p>and he takes polaroid</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>before placing the body</p>
<p>in his bathtub for dismemberment jeffrey said that</p>
<p>while the body was in the bathtub</p>
<p>he repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a hundred percent not</p>
<p>funny i&rsquo;m laughing at the fact that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying this so like nonchalantly</p>
<p>you know what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna just continue</p>
<p>so yes he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>repeatedly kissing and talking to the severed head</p>
<p>while he dismembered the remainder of the body</p>
<p>so it was like his friend</p>
<p>wrap the heart the</p>
<p>biceps and portions of this</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s flesh</p>
<p>from his legs in plastic bags</p>
<p>and then place them in the fridge for</p>
<p>later consumption</p>
<p>jeff boiled the remaining</p>
<p>flesh and organs into a quote</p>
<p>jelly like substance</p>
<p>using again</p>
<p>soilex which was that chemical</p>
<p>cleaner and that was able to help him get the</p>
<p>flesh off of the bones and then he</p>
<p>painted and coated the</p>
<p>skull with enamel</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s creating like his own little museum</p>
<p>on september 24th jeff lured another</p>
<p>victim to his</p>
<p>place but jeff said that this time</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t attracted to this</p>
<p>victim so instead of keeping any of</p>
<p>the body parts</p>
<p>aka the skull</p>
<p>he instead just</p>
<p>photographed</p>
<p>the dismemberment</p>
<p>process and then discarded the remains completely</p>
<p>april seventh</p>
<p>jeffrey encountered</p>
<p>a nineteen year old guy walking to get</p>
<p>his key cut jeffrey</p>
<p>uh saw this person</p>
<p>right and he</p>
<p>asked like hey you</p>
<p>wanna come over to my</p>
<p>apartment and just hang out</p>
<p>they go back to the</p>
<p>apartment drugged him again</p>
<p>but this time as if it couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>worse enough it gets worse</p>
<p>this time he</p>
<p>drills a hole into this</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s skull</p>
<p>and he pours acid into it</p>
<p>now mind you this</p>
<p>victim isn&rsquo;t dead</p>
<p>this victim was simply</p>
<p>knocked out from</p>
<p>um the medication from the drugs he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>alive and he</p>
<p>drills a hole into his</p>
<p>skull i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>kidding you is that not disturbing because it really is</p>
<p>according to jeffrey</p>
<p>this victim</p>
<p>woke up after he</p>
<p>drilled a hole into his head he wakes up</p>
<p>he fucking wakes</p>
<p>up he wakes do you know that he wakes up</p>
<p>the fuck jeffrey was kind of</p>
<p>excited about this</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what he wanted</p>
<p>he was hoping to induce a permanent</p>
<p>unresistant</p>
<p>submissive state somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>someone that he</p>
<p>could control and keep around and if he</p>
<p>could do this and achieve this that</p>
<p>would be his like</p>
<p>ultimate goal</p>
<p>so this victim wakes up</p>
<p>and it makes him excited</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s like oh my god it worked oh my god it worked</p>
<p>jeffrey says that the</p>
<p>victim said quote</p>
<p>i have a headache</p>
<p>what time is it and quote</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t even know that he had a hole in his head</p>
<p>which honestly good</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
<p>in response to this</p>
<p>jeffrey again was like okay i need to drug him</p>
<p>again he needs</p>
<p>to go back to bed go mimis this time he strangles him</p>
<p>and then he decapitated and retained his</p>
<p>skull i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>quite sure why</p>
<p>he ended up killing him</p>
<p>because he wanted to have a</p>
<p>victim who was</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>easy to control and keep</p>
<p>and whatever now this time he really wanted to keep the</p>
<p>skull because it had a hole through it so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using cold water</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s using a little bit of salt in the</p>
<p>water for several weeks</p>
<p>and letting it soak and hopes to permanently keep it</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t work though</p>
<p>so he had to discard it</p>
<p>again in 1991</p>
<p>there were fellow residents in the</p>
<p>apartment complex they were</p>
<p>repeatedly complaining to the manager that</p>
<p>there was foul</p>
<p>smells coming from jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment and</p>
<p>on top of that they also complained that there was like</p>
<p>sounds of falling objects</p>
<p>and occasionally a chainsaw</p>
<p>so of course people are complaining there&rsquo;s a smell</p>
<p>chainsaw so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re calling the manager letting them know</p>
<p>so the manager contacts jeffrey</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go see</p>
<p>him in person of course just calls him up on the</p>
<p>phone and he says hey you know</p>
<p>other people are</p>
<p>complaining that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smell coming from</p>
<p>your place and jeffrey was like yeah well my</p>
<p>freezer broke</p>
<p>all the food inside of it it just became</p>
<p>spoiled and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smelling this</p>
<p>the manager was like oh okay yeah</p>
<p>so just get that cleared up</p>
<p>people are complaining blah blah blah hang up the</p>
<p>phone click</p>
<p>like a week or two goes by</p>
<p>and the manager calls him</p>
<p>again and he said bing bing hey</p>
<p>so your neighbors are</p>
<p>still complaining that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smell coming from</p>
<p>your apartment</p>
<p>like i thought you had</p>
<p>cleared this up and jeffrey said that oh my god</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>several of my tropical fish had died</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s causing this horrendous smell</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>and the manager&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay just get it</p>
<p>fixed up what</p>
<p>about that chainsaw</p>
<p>and then jeffrey&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what chainsaw</p>
<p>if the manager</p>
<p>would just have simply gone there</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s probably better for his</p>
<p>safety if he didn&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>definitely should have had someone go by</p>
<p>anyhow so on the afternoon of may 26 1991</p>
<p>one jeffrey</p>
<p>found another 14 year old boy</p>
<p>and offered him</p>
<p>money to hang out with him at his</p>
<p>apartment jeffrey said that the boy was</p>
<p>initially pretty reluctant to go</p>
<p>with jeffrey</p>
<p>so finally this boy&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>i guess i don&rsquo;t want to say comfortable enough</p>
<p>cause i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak on his behalf</p>
<p>but he ends up</p>
<p>going back with jeffrey to his home</p>
<p>and the boy</p>
<p>ended up posing for some</p>
<p>pictures and then jeff drugged him</p>
<p>the poor boy passed out jeffrey</p>
<p>now getting creative with his</p>
<p>whatever the fuck he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>again he takes a</p>
<p>drill and he</p>
<p>drills a single hole into the victim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skull and again</p>
<p>he injected</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid</p>
<p>into the frontal</p>
<p>lobe this victim is technically still</p>
<p>alive jeffrey</p>
<p>had led this boy</p>
<p>into his bedroom</p>
<p>in his bedroom</p>
<p>the body of a</p>
<p>victim he had killed three days</p>
<p>earlier was laying</p>
<p>naked on the</p>
<p>floor the boy sees this</p>
<p>before he passes out he sees this</p>
<p>he kind of panics but then he gets dizzy</p>
<p>and then he falls</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>while this boy was just kind of laying there jeffrey</p>
<p>drinks several beers</p>
<p>while laying next to him and then for some odd reason</p>
<p>jeffrey takes off</p>
<p>he leaves his</p>
<p>apartment and he goes to a</p>
<p>local bar to have a</p>
<p>drink and then</p>
<p>after that he purchases more alcohol at a liquor</p>
<p>store and then comes back to his</p>
<p>apartment when he comes back to his</p>
<p>apartment it&rsquo;s pretty like</p>
<p>still early in the morning</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s walking back and sees outside of his</p>
<p>apartment is that young boy</p>
<p>sitting outside</p>
<p>naked on the corner of the</p>
<p>street now there were</p>
<p>three young</p>
<p>women surrounding him</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>asking him like are you okay what&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>hello like to this</p>
<p>young boy but can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think can&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re trying to like get some answers from this</p>
<p>this boy that they they</p>
<p>found on the street</p>
<p>so jeffrey sees this and he&rsquo;s like oh sh</p>
<p>so jeffrey goes up to the trio</p>
<p>the three of them</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like oh my gosh</p>
<p>this is my friend he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drunk don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry i know him</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna go back to my</p>
<p>apartment he</p>
<p>tries to grab the</p>
<p>young boy and takes him back to the</p>
<p>apartment but</p>
<p>these women just have</p>
<p>you know that gut feeling that something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right they had already called 911</p>
<p>they were trying to get jeffrey to stop</p>
<p>delaying him from</p>
<p>going back to the</p>
<p>apartment with the</p>
<p>young boy so police pull up oh yeah baby police pull up</p>
<p>and jeffrey told them that the</p>
<p>young boy was his 19 year old boyfriend</p>
<p>and that he</p>
<p>drink too much</p>
<p>and the police seemed to</p>
<p>not question</p>
<p>any further</p>
<p>for good reason this</p>
<p>upset one of the</p>
<p>women who called</p>
<p>911 she was like no no no something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right here one of the</p>
<p>women actually pulled the knife</p>
<p>officer aside and she</p>
<p>tried to tell them that this</p>
<p>young man was</p>
<p>bleeding from like his back</p>
<p>or like his butt</p>
<p>he had struggled</p>
<p>when jeff was trying to get him back to the apartment</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>just expressing how she felt like something is</p>
<p>going on and the officer told a</p>
<p>woman to quote</p>
<p>but out shut the hell up and to not interfere and</p>
<p>quote great</p>
<p>the police officer</p>
<p>said this is between them it&rsquo;s not your problem don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about it</p>
<p>run along poor</p>
<p>women are just trying to do the</p>
<p>right thing and</p>
<p>so the officers</p>
<p>ended up like</p>
<p>covering the</p>
<p>young man with a</p>
<p>towel they walk him back to jeff jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment jeffrey</p>
<p>still trying to</p>
<p>prove to the officers that this</p>
<p>young man is like his lover</p>
<p>he showed them the</p>
<p>polaroid set he had</p>
<p>taken of him</p>
<p>trying to prove like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s my boyfriend he lets me take like sexy</p>
<p>pictures of him and then the officers</p>
<p>they leave the home</p>
<p>and they tell jeff</p>
<p>to just take good care of his lover</p>
<p>so once the police officers</p>
<p>had left his apartment</p>
<p>jeff once again</p>
<p>had injected</p>
<p>hydrochloric</p>
<p>acid into this young</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>this time noah killed him okay hold on this is</p>
<p>definitely too much</p>
<p>so the following day jeffrey had called out of work</p>
<p>because he really</p>
<p>wanted to devote his day to dismembering two</p>
<p>bodies that he had</p>
<p>in his home at that time</p>
<p>so he was like i can&rsquo;t come in</p>
<p>today like i&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>jeffrey would lure</p>
<p>three more men</p>
<p>kill and dismember</p>
<p>them in the same way he did with his previous</p>
<p>victims he would call out</p>
<p>for more to</p>
<p>dedicate his time to dismembering his victims</p>
<p>which eventually</p>
<p>led to jeffrey</p>
<p>getting fired</p>
<p>because of that</p>
<p>he said that it made him kill</p>
<p>and dismember another</p>
<p>victim on july 22</p>
<p>1991 jeffrey</p>
<p>approached three men</p>
<p>with an offer of 100</p>
<p>to accompany him to his</p>
<p>apartment to</p>
<p>pose for some nude</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>drink beer and simply</p>
<p>him company one of the trio</p>
<p>was a 32 year old man</p>
<p>and he agreed he was like okay sure i</p>
<p>could use 100</p>
<p>bucks so he goes back to</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and this fictum said that instantly</p>
<p>when he walked in the door he got a whiff</p>
<p>of just like a</p>
<p>foul smell and then he noticed several boxes</p>
<p>of hydrochloric</p>
<p>acid on the</p>
<p>floor and he&rsquo;s like hey so yeah what&rsquo;s that all</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>cause i mean</p>
<p>who just has that shit laying around</p>
<p>maybe you do</p>
<p>a little suspicious</p>
<p>you know so he&rsquo;s asking what&rsquo;s that all</p>
<p>about and jeff told him oh i use it to</p>
<p>clean bricks and</p>
<p>okay uh huh</p>
<p>so the two of them go into</p>
<p>jeff&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>and there in the bedroom was a 57 gallon drum</p>
<p>in the corner</p>
<p>which the victim said</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>definitely coming</p>
<p>from this drum</p>
<p>jeff then placed</p>
<p>his head on the</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s chest</p>
<p>kind of like in a romantic way</p>
<p>but instead he was holding out a knife</p>
<p>so not very romantic</p>
<p>jeff said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to rip your</p>
<p>heart out of course</p>
<p>of course the</p>
<p>victim&rsquo;s like what the fuck man</p>
<p>and he freaks out now at this</p>
<p>point the victim</p>
<p>he just knew like some shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to go down there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird smells there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>suspicious boxes</p>
<p>this dude is just fucking</p>
<p>weird he&rsquo;s gonna rip my</p>
<p>heart out i</p>
<p>gotta get you know and this</p>
<p>victim was kind of like looking around trying to</p>
<p>plan his escape and he&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s windows around i</p>
<p>could try and like jump out of a window</p>
<p>i could just run</p>
<p>right out the</p>
<p>front door or i</p>
<p>could just wait</p>
<p>and this victim knew</p>
<p>if i wait i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna die like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no waiting</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>think fuck what do i do</p>
<p>maybe if i go to the bathroom i</p>
<p>could like jump out the window in the bathroom this</p>
<p>victim asked</p>
<p>jeffrey like</p>
<p>can may i use your restroom please</p>
<p>and he goes in there no window</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like fuck so he comes</p>
<p>back out they&rsquo;re hanging out in the living room at this</p>
<p>point now when they&rsquo;re hanging out in the living room</p>
<p>the victim again is like</p>
<p>hey can i use your bathroom one more time</p>
<p>not sure what his thought process was at this point but</p>
<p>whatever at</p>
<p>least he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s trying to do something</p>
<p>right so he goes back to the bathroom</p>
<p>now at this</p>
<p>point when he</p>
<p>comes back out he sees like jeff isn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>fully paying attention he just</p>
<p>punches them in the face as hard as he can</p>
<p>and then he runs out the front door</p>
<p>at 11 30 pm</p>
<p>the victim he flagged down</p>
<p>to milwaukee</p>
<p>police officers</p>
<p>like hey this dude</p>
<p>just like fucking try to attack me there&rsquo;s some fucking</p>
<p>weird ass shit</p>
<p>going on over there</p>
<p>and fictum had handcuff</p>
<p>a handcuff on his wrist</p>
<p>now i failed to mention</p>
<p>that at some</p>
<p>point when the</p>
<p>victim went to jeffrey&rsquo;s home the</p>
<p>victim wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>paying attention he was kind of looking the</p>
<p>other way and jeffrey had placed a handcuff on his</p>
<p>wrist and he was</p>
<p>going to handcuff him</p>
<p>but the victim was like what the fuck</p>
<p>are you doing jeffrey was like well you know i thought</p>
<p>we could hang out he couldn&rsquo;t get the handcuff</p>
<p>off so he was</p>
<p>still wearing it when he ran out of jeffrey&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>so when he finds</p>
<p>these police officers he&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>gotta come over with me and he shows him he has</p>
<p>a handcuff and he&rsquo;s like can you get</p>
<p>these handcuffs off of me so they try to use</p>
<p>their own key to try to get the handcuff off</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an off brand the keys didn&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>police officers</p>
<p>were like well let&rsquo;s just go down to jeff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment and get the key so we can get these off</p>
<p>when the officers</p>
<p>and the victim</p>
<p>arrived to jeff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house you see the</p>
<p>victim felt safe enough to go back to jeffrey&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>because the two police officers were with him</p>
<p>so they all go</p>
<p>to jeffrey&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>jeff invited the trio</p>
<p>inside and acknowledged he had indeed</p>
<p>place the handcuffs on him</p>
<p>although he offered no explanation</p>
<p>as to why he had done so jeff told one of the officers</p>
<p>that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedroom</p>
<p>dresser they all walk to the bedroom</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s kind of like trying</p>
<p>to box him out like i&rsquo;ll get the key i&rsquo;ll get the key</p>
<p>trying to get to the key before them</p>
<p>but instead police officers are like get out of our way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get em</p>
<p>and this is when one of the police officers saw the</p>
<p>dresser drawer it was open</p>
<p>and guess what</p>
<p>it contained</p>
<p>many polaroid</p>
<p>pictures many of</p>
<p>which were just</p>
<p>human bodies in various</p>
<p>stages of dismemberment</p>
<p>upon further inspection they see that the</p>
<p>decor in the</p>
<p>background of</p>
<p>these polaroid pictures</p>
<p>indicated to them that they had been</p>
<p>taken in the very</p>
<p>apartment in</p>
<p>which they were</p>
<p>standing the police officer had</p>
<p>taken some of the polaroids</p>
<p>walked into the living room to show his partner</p>
<p>these are for real</p>
<p>when jeffrey</p>
<p>saw that the police officer was holding several</p>
<p>of his polaroids</p>
<p>he fought with the officers in</p>
<p>effort to resist</p>
<p>arrest because they were trying to</p>
<p>put him in handcuffs</p>
<p>while they searched the rest of his home</p>
<p>and called a</p>
<p>second squad card</p>
<p>for backup at this</p>
<p>point one of the officers they</p>
<p>open up the refrigerator and they see like a freshly</p>
<p>severed head of a male</p>
<p>on the bottom shelf</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to</p>
<p>see the polaroid</p>
<p>pictures and then</p>
<p>to open up the</p>
<p>refrigerator and just see a head staring at you</p>
<p>i feel so bad</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>these officers have</p>
<p>got to be really fucked up then they do a more detailed</p>
<p>search of the</p>
<p>apartment when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching the</p>
<p>apartment they reveal a</p>
<p>total of four severed heads</p>
<p>in jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kitchen a total of</p>
<p>seven skulls some were</p>
<p>painted some were</p>
<p>found in jeffrey&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>inside a closet</p>
<p>there were just</p>
<p>skulls and body parts kind of just scattered in</p>
<p>random places</p>
<p>and a surprise at</p>
<p>every corner</p>
<p>they also found two</p>
<p>human hearts</p>
<p>and a portion of an</p>
<p>arm muscle each</p>
<p>wrapped inside a plastic bag in the bottom</p>
<p>shelf of the</p>
<p>floor jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freezer investigators discovered an entire</p>
<p>torso plus a bag of</p>
<p>human organs and</p>
<p>flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom</p>
<p>of the freezer</p>
<p>throughout the</p>
<p>apartment investigators discovered two</p>
<p>entire skeletons</p>
<p>a pair of severed hands</p>
<p>two severed</p>
<p>and preserved</p>
<p>penises a mummified</p>
<p>scalp and in the 57 gallon</p>
<p>drum remember it was in the bedroom</p>
<p>three further dismembered</p>
<p>torsos were dissolving in acid solution a</p>
<p>total of 74</p>
<p>polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s victims were</p>
<p>found obviously jeffrey was arrested</p>
<p>on july 23 1991</p>
<p>jeffrey was brought in for questioning</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>been arrested he&rsquo;s been sitting in prison they</p>
<p>bring him and they got a question him you know</p>
<p>what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on with you bro jeffrey had admitted</p>
<p>to investigators to having murdered</p>
<p>16 young men</p>
<p>in wisconsin</p>
<p>since 1987 and on</p>
<p>january 30th 1992 his</p>
<p>trial began</p>
<p>for the 15 counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>the trial had lasted</p>
<p>two weeks and jeff was sentenced to life imprisonment</p>
<p>plus 70 years</p>
<p>the death penalty was not an option because the</p>
<p>state of wisconsin had abolished capital punishment</p>
<p>in eighteen</p>
<p>fifty three</p>
<p>so he was just gonna</p>
<p>spend the rest of his life in prison</p>
<p>personal opinion</p>
<p>here one hundred percent personal opinion</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>death penalty i like the thought of people who&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>awful things i like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like it i like the idea</p>
<p>of them being miserable in prison for the rest of</p>
<p>their lives</p>
<p>versus getting</p>
<p>an easy way out you know like when you get the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>you get like injected with something and then you die</p>
<p>no not on my</p>
<p>watch you go there you sit and you suffer</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the best punishment</p>
<p>sorry not sorry but it&rsquo;s a personal opinion</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>jeffrey had</p>
<p>spent the first year</p>
<p>of his incarceration</p>
<p>in solitary</p>
<p>confinement due to concerns for his physical</p>
<p>safety amongst</p>
<p>his fellow inmates</p>
<p>people were threatening him</p>
<p>people wanted him dead he then</p>
<p>was transferred to a less secure unit</p>
<p>after a year</p>
<p>on the morning of november 28 1994</p>
<p>jeff was found on the</p>
<p>floor of the bathrooms of the gym</p>
<p>suffering from extreme</p>
<p>head and facial wounds</p>
<p>he had been beat in the face</p>
<p>and head with a 20 inch metal bar</p>
<p>and it seemed his face had also been</p>
<p>slammed against the wall during his assault</p>
<p>when he was</p>
<p>found jeff was</p>
<p>technically</p>
<p>he was still</p>
<p>alive okay and he was rushed to a nearby hospital but</p>
<p>was pronounced dead one hour</p>
<p>later there was a fellow inmate</p>
<p>who was serving a life sentence</p>
<p>he is the one who</p>
<p>actually attacked jeff and authorities had asked him</p>
<p>hey man like why did you attack jeff</p>
<p>he said that him</p>
<p>the killer jeffrey and then another</p>
<p>inmate the trio they were set to go</p>
<p>clean the staff locker room together</p>
<p>and normally an officer</p>
<p>watches you to make sure</p>
<p>something like this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen but for a</p>
<p>split second</p>
<p>an officer left from my</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>i think the officer was in on it</p>
<p>according to this inmate who killed jeffrey</p>
<p>when he was beating jeffrey</p>
<p>with a metal pole jeffrey didn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>noise he didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t cry he didn&rsquo;t even flinch</p>
<p>he just beat him and yeah he said it was</p>
<p>weird when they</p>
<p>asked him like why did you do it this inmate said</p>
<p>quote god told me to do it</p>
<p>and quote not only did this inmate kill jeffrey</p>
<p>but he also killed another inmate who is</p>
<p>cleaning with them</p>
<p>again he said god told him</p>
<p>that he needed to do it a lot of people were very happy</p>
<p>about it when they</p>
<p>heard that he was murdered but inside the prison</p>
<p>a lot of the</p>
<p>guards were very</p>
<p>upset because at the end of the day</p>
<p>like murder is murder</p>
<p>you know it was like a big deal it was a very big deal</p>
<p>plus a lot of people wanted him dead though so to</p>
<p>think that he was</p>
<p>gonna like actually be fine</p>
<p>so he died this guy was just really fucked up</p>
<p>you know jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother had passed away in</p>
<p>the year 2000</p>
<p>and his father retired father</p>
<p>ended up writing a book</p>
<p>about his experience and his life with jeffrey</p>
<p>jeffrey&rsquo;s younger brother remember his name was david</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>changing his last name he wants nothing</p>
<p>to do with it so don&rsquo;t even look him up and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame him he want don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like don&rsquo;t involve</p>
<p>me i want nothing to do with this shit good for him</p>
<p>and that my friends is a</p>
<p>story about jeffrey</p>
<p>dahmer it&rsquo;s a long one</p>
<p>right i lost my</p>
<p>voice so sad</p>
<p>there were so many</p>
<p>victims who had died a horrible</p>
<p>horrible death at the hands of this</p>
<p>gross ass dweeb</p>
<p>sorry but he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a dweeb don&rsquo;t even get me</p>
<p>started on the fans</p>
<p>okay jeffrey</p>
<p>thomas one of</p>
<p>those people who has so many fans</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disturbing</p>
<p>if any of you guys</p>
<p>have netflix</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watched a show</p>
<p>on netflix called</p>
<p>the dark tourist</p>
<p>go watch it if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it yet there&rsquo;s this episode</p>
<p>about jeffrey dahmer and how</p>
<p>they have like a tour you can take</p>
<p>this tour takes you around the city to</p>
<p>where jeffrey dahmer hung out and shows you</p>
<p>the different</p>
<p>gay bars he hung out at and then shows you the</p>
<p>apartment complex and</p>
<p>where he left his victims</p>
<p>where he killed his victim</p>
<p>and the main people who like to take</p>
<p>these tours are like</p>
<p>bachelorette parties</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not even kidding you</p>
<p>look i get it</p>
<p>like being curious and wanting to go on one of</p>
<p>these tours like i get it like you know i</p>
<p>would want to do it but bachelorette</p>
<p>party like what the fuck</p>
<p>that should not</p>
<p>be allowed but whatever on this show they like ask</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>women who are taking the tour</p>
<p>like why are you interested</p>
<p>in jeffrey dahmer and the girls are like oh my god</p>
<p>like really good looking he&rsquo;s handsome</p>
<p>and like he just</p>
<p>loved love and like trying to romanticize the</p>
<p>whole the whole</p>
<p>story is weird</p>
<p>because first of all ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t even interested in you he liked dick and</p>
<p>second of all</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t love love</p>
<p>he loved bones and</p>
<p>skulls but i just i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>there are so many books there are so many</p>
<p>movies there are so many tv shows that are</p>
<p>based off this man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story why they</p>
<p>claim he&rsquo;s like one of the</p>
<p>worst but i</p>
<p>could think of</p>
<p>worse ones i think</p>
<p>truly what captured a lot of people&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>was the fact that he was good looking</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shallow like that let&rsquo;s be real here same with</p>
<p>chris watts</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>chris watts case i was obsessed with it i did my very</p>
<p>first murder mystery makeup on the chris watts case</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>obsessed with it because he was good looking</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s be honest here same with jeffrey dahmer</p>
<p>i think he looks like a nerd</p>
<p>what can you say</p>
<p>i will do ted bundy</p>
<p>sometime in the future</p>
<p>and i have a list which is</p>
<p>stories in general</p>

<p>sending my way</p>
