<p>i&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to do this</p>
<p>like for the rest of my life and sustain</p>
<p>it so the big things for me are morning</p>
<p>coffee</p>
<p>and after work that glass of wine that i</p>
<p>used to have and so kind of the morning</p>
<p>the first question is in the morning</p>
<p>coffee</p>
<p>you say one cup</p>
<p>can i take it and dilute it and have</p>
<p>three cups in the morning is that going</p>
<p>to affect my</p>
<p>uh insulin</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not going to affect your</p>
<p>insulin i think if you can handle it if</p>
<p>you sleep okay because i think the</p>
<p>biggest problem with the caffeine is</p>
<p>um if your liver is really strong and it</p>
<p>can detoxify the caffeine and you can</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>go for it but if you start</p>
<p>having affect your sleep then we know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the issue so i think even with</p>
<p>myself because my liver um is not the</p>
<p>healthiest in the world or wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>healthiest now it&rsquo;s much better but if i</p>
<p>do more than a cup it definitely starts</p>
<p>affecting the sleep so</p>
<p>no problem there i can drink it until i</p>
<p>go to bed so that that number one thank</p>
<p>you for that i loved hearing that uh the</p>
<p>other one is the glass of wine and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using your um electrolyte powder i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking for something when i&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>dinner at night i&rsquo;m my my i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fasting in a 20-hour sort of thing so</p>
<p>four-hour window</p>
<p>i want to have something to drink while</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m making dinner</p>
<p>what do you suggest</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you know i probably wouldn&rsquo;t do it every</p>
<p>day and the problem is that the it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even the carbs it&rsquo;s the alcohol inhibits</p>
<p>the liver for making those ketones</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one issue</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>what you could do and i would try this</p>
<p>as a substitute i would</p>
<p>um get some</p>
<p>kombucha tea okay and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t drink the whole thing just drink</p>
<p>half of it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost the same</p>
<p>tech uh consistency is like</p>
<p>some carbonated</p>
<p>alcohol beverage and it does create a</p>
<p>calming effect there&rsquo;s a small amount of</p>
<p>alcohol</p>
<p>but make sure it has the lowest amount</p>
<p>of sugars because sometimes they they</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t leave it out you know it</p>
<p>might be a pain in the butt but</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m making my own kombucha tea</p>
<p>and you should try it because</p>
<p>you can leave it out for even longer and</p>
<p>have those microbes eat up even more the</p>
<p>sugar and it&rsquo;s like very very acidic but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it gives that nice um good</p>
<p>effect to your gut because of all the</p>
<p>lactic acid</p>
<p>and it can actually kill two birds with</p>
<p>one stone it can</p>
<p>make you feel like you drink some</p>
<p>alcohol but without drinking it and then</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>it has the benefit of the digestion</p>
<p>perfect thank you for that i love it</p>
<p>okay if i have can i get one more minute</p>
<p>stephen and i talked about this</p>
<p>what about my dogs</p>
<p>should i be intermittent fasting my dogs</p>
<p>yeah you should you should i think um</p>
<p>you know two meals sometimes even one</p>
<p>meal but</p>
<p>dogs don&rsquo;t need these snacks in fact i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the problem with a lot of</p>
<p>owners of pets they start feeding them</p>
<p>all these snacks like they don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not designed to have</p>
<p>frequent meals oh okay good that&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>but there is some you know as far as dog</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>i would highly recommend getting um</p>
<p>uh i can&rsquo;t remember the the brand name</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like organ meats and stuff it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not this</p>
<p>vegetarian type soy and corn and wheat</p>
<p>that they give these dogs so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another point and then you said you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from vancouver british columbia i am</p>
<p>originally dallas texas but i live in</p>
<p>vancouver</p>
<p>wow that is probably to me one of the</p>
<p>most beautiful places</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve been it&rsquo;s just gorgeous clean</p>
<p>so i do remember visiting that area it</p>
<p>was just like wow what the heck is going</p>
<p>on here it&rsquo;s just amazing it&rsquo;s true it</p>
<p>is so beautiful and it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>beautiful with what we&rsquo;re doing i tell</p>
<p>everybody about the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>i think the work you&rsquo;re doing in terms</p>
<p>of the the cancer prevention and curing</p>
<p>as well i think there&rsquo;s a key there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so important i&rsquo;m so glad that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing this and thank you hey i i just</p>
<p>want to be known for curing cancer and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just being very sarcastic</p>
<p>frankly i&rsquo;m not so i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible what you&rsquo;re doing and i think</p>
<p>you are on that path so</p>
<p>yeah well i tell you just have to be so</p>
<p>careful um when you start mentioning</p>
<p>that c word so you know we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>basically um</p>
<p>referring people to</p>
<p>you know various uh websites they can do</p>
<p>more research but yes that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>exciting data very exciting data i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll mention it for you it&rsquo;s cancer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you so much thank you thank you</p>
<p>for having me on the show sure</p>
<p>well we got her first because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dealing with all sorts of hollywood big</p>
<p>shots so she&rsquo;s going to go back online</p>
<p>here shortly and</p>
<p>get them all on screen for us so thank</p>
<p>you so much susan from vancouver we</p>
<p>appreciate that</p>
<p>and dr berg why don&rsquo;t we kick off our</p>
<p>first exciting quiz question here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay what is the only two</p>
<p>foods that do not trigger insulin</p>
<p>all right audience climb on that</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s an interesting one i i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure that everyone adopts the right type</p>
<p>of keto so kh from youtube i have been</p>
<p>on keto for two and a half years</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve developed lactose intolerance</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t keep eggs down since going on</p>
<p>low carb my liver now needs attention</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve gained 50 pounds</p>
<p>and developed lymphedema</p>
<p>where has she gone wrong on the keto</p>
<p>approach</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to evaluate that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you do just keto which really is</p>
<p>just low carb okay it&rsquo;s just really low</p>
<p>carb um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a clear definition</p>
<p>it allows for a lot of other ingredients</p>
<p>that can be a problem the benefits of</p>
<p>just doing a low carb are huge</p>
<p>but if you also in addition to that do</p>
<p>the healthy version of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet which i recommend</p>
<p>you can get a lot of other health</p>
<p>benefits and um</p>
<p>i would highly doubt you would ever</p>
<p>develop more allergies or intolerances</p>
<p>or even lymphedema if you did that but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know what else you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but i will say with lactose intolerance</p>
<p>if you could find some area that you can</p>
<p>get</p>
<p>raw milk and actually get the raw milk</p>
<p>kefir</p>
<p>or the raw milk real raw milk cheese</p>
<p>you may not find that you have lactose</p>
<p>intolerant because there are microbes</p>
<p>that make</p>
<p>lactase which is the enzyme to break</p>
<p>down lactose</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so there are microbes that are making</p>
<p>this enzyme and when you pasteurize it</p>
<p>you kill off those microbes so guess</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna get you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>lactose intolerance so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something to investigate and</p>
<p>watch my video i just released it</p>
<p>recently actually was it yesterday or</p>
<p>yeah i think yesterday</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>and i tell you what later in the show</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go to moheb who&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>tunisia so he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>that stuff in but that&rsquo;s really truly</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>uh and you know well it&rsquo;s time it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>to do a road trip and visit all these</p>
<p>wonderful places well indeed and you</p>
<p>know uh we had a staff meeting i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to go to the details but all i can</p>
<p>say is that boy dr berg&rsquo;s show is</p>
<p>exploding all over the world and the new</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know level of um</p>
<p>people subscribing is just unheard of so</p>
<p>obviously</p>
<p>the word is going around that what dr</p>
<p>berg</p>
<p>is recommending or talking about is</p>
<p>really working and i&rsquo;m certainly a</p>
<p>advocate and</p>
<p>benefactor of all that stuff so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see well i&rsquo;ll tell you i i will tell you</p>
<p>the secret</p>
<p>for subscribers is</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ask for people to subscribe and</p>
<p>smash that like button i just hate that</p>
<p>when people say that and all these uh</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>these uh youtube videos will tell them</p>
<p>to smash that like</p>
<p>if the people are gonna sign up and sign</p>
<p>up if they&rsquo;re not there they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to sign up but i never sign up</p>
<p>when people tell me to do that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>tell me is the information good it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help me great i will sign up</p>
<p>very interesting hear that youtube</p>
<p>purveyors for goodness sakes okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see mary veronica from youtube my poor</p>
<p>friend has gained 60 pounds she said</p>
<p>everything went haywire after menopause</p>
<p>and now has a has become a diabetic</p>
<p>with thyroid and arthritis issues would</p>
<p>your apple cider vinegar drink help her</p>
<p>a little bit a little bit</p>
<p>the problem is the cortisol</p>
<p>increases when you have menopause in</p>
<p>some women and then the cortisol then</p>
<p>mobilizes</p>
<p>um your proteins and it increases your</p>
<p>liver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making sugar so your liver starts making</p>
<p>sugar and you start turning proteins in</p>
<p>the sugar and then you start getting</p>
<p>atrophy and and it just kind of goes</p>
<p>downhill so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve talked about in videos</p>
<p>related to menopause but you really have</p>
<p>to support the adrenal gland of course</p>
<p>on top of doing the basic eating plan</p>
<p>and i think you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll feel much</p>
<p>better if you do that but</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>during menopause that oh the ovaries go</p>
<p>into retirement but the adrenal glands</p>
<p>now have to produce the same hormones so</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re stressed then everything is</p>
<p>magnified</p>
<p>interesting okay well guess what the</p>
<p>audience found your question interesting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve answered it and it asked</p>
<p>what are the only two foods that do not</p>
<p>trigger</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>80 percent said</p>
<p>fat and fiber 10 said green vegetables</p>
<p>and green tea and 10 say celery and</p>
<p>lemon are they on to something dog</p>
<p>they are on to something and the answer</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>fat and fiber wow now i&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about the like the fiber in</p>
<p>whole grains or added synthetic fibers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking about like fiber from</p>
<p>vegetable and um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and then fat as a pure fat so what</p>
<p>what food combinations would be a good</p>
<p>combination to consume both fiber and</p>
<p>fat</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to keep your insulin</p>
<p>low</p>
<p>well what about</p>
<p>a salad with olive olive oil that would</p>
<p>be a good one or maybe celery with</p>
<p>peanut butter</p>
<p>or even</p>
<p>more tasty yet some raw cream</p>
<p>and whipped into whipped cream and then</p>
<p>some blueberries which has some fiber in</p>
<p>it so these are just things that you can</p>
<p>add to your</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>either as a food or dessert whatever</p>
<p>that will definitely help you keep that</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>lowered in addition to other benefits</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible i had a big bowl of</p>
<p>blueberries they&rsquo;re great in north</p>
<p>carolina they grow a lot of them here</p>
<p>and with heavy cream and it tastes like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re cheating your brains out but alas</p>
<p>you know steve steve you should take it</p>
<p>one step further</p>
<p>go to real milk.com i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s 40</p>
<p>i think 43 states that now you can</p>
<p>get raw milk through various</p>
<p>methods</p>
<p>legally</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>make whipped cream out of raw cream</p>
<p>from grass-fed cows</p>
<p>talk about</p>
<p>you know this the fat in the milk has</p>
<p>loaded with vitamin k it has the enzyme</p>
<p>that has the fatty acids it has um</p>
<p>all sorts of things for the immune</p>
<p>system but it also has something else</p>
<p>called the waltzin factor which is</p>
<p>anti-stiffness</p>
<p>very good for arthritis rheumatoid</p>
<p>and specifically it</p>
<p>it really helps people that have</p>
<p>stiffness in their wrists</p>
<p>for some reason but the waltz and factor</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called um kind of like a</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>chemical that actually can a chemical</p>
<p>compound that</p>
<p>helps you make your own cortisol</p>
<p>naturally so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to look it up well i&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you though you know after you have a big</p>
<p>thing of cream and blueberries you sort</p>
<p>of brace yourself for that horrible</p>
<p>twinkie shock that used to happen you</p>
<p>know when you have eat terrible stuff</p>
<p>and it just doesn&rsquo;t happen you remain</p>
<p>peaceful you&rsquo;ve had a nice</p>
<p>uh you know final part of your meal that</p>
<p>is my dessert that and strawberry</p>
<p>sometimes uh with cream and uh my</p>
<p>cholesterol numbers aren&rsquo;t up i mean</p>
<p>good grief uh there&rsquo;s something to do</p>
<p>and else the the other interesting thing</p>
<p>if you want to do an experiment check</p>
<p>your blood sugars um</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>if you have that salad</p>
<p>before the meal with olive oil uh and</p>
<p>vinaigrette whatever</p>
<p>um you will find regardless of what you</p>
<p>eat your blood sugars</p>
<p>will be better with that fiber the fiber</p>
<p>tends to buffer these other foods</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just another little</p>
<p>trick that you can use to help keep your</p>
<p>blood sugars even lower than they</p>
<p>normally would so that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>you know because i do i always recommend</p>
<p>a salad before you eat so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>another tip steve just make mental note</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve uh i have my mind is like a steel</p>
<p>trap i&rsquo;ll never forget it</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the next question</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>all right so</p>
<p>which is worse</p>
<p>a high carb diet or</p>
<p>snacking</p>
<p>for weight loss</p>
<p>just in general</p>
<p>if you compare those two actions</p>
<p>what would be worse</p>
<p>all right dig into that audience poor</p>
<p>suzy from facebook says please help how</p>
<p>do we prevent bad breath while fasting</p>
<p>if you do the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>ingredients with the you know the</p>
<p>high amounts of chlorophyll in the</p>
<p>greens and things like that</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have that occur</p>
<p>uh especially after you get through the</p>
<p>adaptation phase</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve not found that um and if you if</p>
<p>it does occur then that means you</p>
<p>probably need some more probiotics so a</p>
<p>good sauerkraut would be good or maybe</p>
<p>even a good kefir</p>
<p>plain</p>
<p>would be good so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m experimenting with kefir right now</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to create another video on</p>
<p>it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting uh product that has</p>
<p>so much more um</p>
<p>microbial life than yogurt and it has</p>
<p>the combination of the friendly yeast</p>
<p>and the bacteria and um if it&rsquo;s from raw</p>
<p>milk but you could really um help</p>
<p>with that lactose intolerance with your</p>
<p>digestion and you don&rsquo;t need much</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>stay tuned</p>
<p>very good paula from youtube i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following your she says advice it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh information for a year now and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost 15 kilograms so it&rsquo;s at 30</p>
<p>something pounds on one meal a day i</p>
<p>probably eat too much cheese though and</p>
<p>have hit a roadblock in my weight loss</p>
<p>should i cut out the cheese to see</p>
<p>better results</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a bad idea</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pasteurized from pasteurized milk but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole checklist of things that</p>
<p>i i talk about on a lot of videos when</p>
<p>you get into plateau number one make</p>
<p>look look at your carbs revive the carbs</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing enough fasting maybe do</p>
<p>more fasting make sure the quality foods</p>
<p>are there make sure your sleep is good</p>
<p>make sure your stress is good make sure</p>
<p>your digestion is good all these things</p>
<p>to look at so because for one person it</p>
<p>might be a different issue than someone</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>very good well i&rsquo;m a little worried</p>
<p>about jaden from youtube because he</p>
<p>wants to know what could be causing</p>
<p>white circular spots on my arms and legs</p>
<p>i mean i have no idea um</p>
<p>could it be a pin worm i have no idea</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have to get more information</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>i mean you have vitiligo which is a</p>
<p>another issue so i i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>wow to see a picture yeah jayden just</p>
<p>tell your um</p>
<p>girlfriend to stay 10 paces until you</p>
<p>figure out what&rsquo;s going on with that we</p>
<p>wish you well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve got the answer to quiz</p>
<p>question number two which asked which is</p>
<p>worse a high carb diet or snacking for</p>
<p>weight loss 70 percent say it&rsquo;s snacking</p>
<p>the villain 30 say it&rsquo;s high carbs</p>
<p>you know this is another fascinating</p>
<p>topic um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually snacking and i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you why i think it&rsquo;s snacking is</p>
<p>worse than a high carb</p>
<p>both of them increase insulin</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>personally when i</p>
<p>gave up the snacking which are like</p>
<p>apples and peanut butter i gave up the</p>
<p>snack and i had two apples um with</p>
<p>peanut butter one mid mid at mid morning</p>
<p>mid afternoon i gave that up i dropped</p>
<p>from 211 to 180 pounds</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about that is</p>
<p>the a study that was done on children</p>
<p>and found</p>
<p>as the most isolated</p>
<p>validated factor of</p>
<p>obesity it was the snacking more than</p>
<p>any other factor</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>plus</p>
<p>steve when you grew up</p>
<p>did you have a lot of uh well i guess</p>
<p>you grew up in</p>
<p>the 40s right now i&rsquo;m just kidding um</p>
<p>the 70s or the 60s i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know how old you are but</p>
<p>let me just say this when you grew up</p>
<p>did you see as many overweight children</p>
<p>as you do now you know uh</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t eat well we had peanut butter</p>
<p>and jelly with the with the crust cut</p>
<p>off so there was just pure white mush</p>
<p>and a kool-aid ice cube filled with</p>
<p>sugar in a paper towel that was our</p>
<p>snack but there wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>heavy person in sight if you saw someone</p>
<p>heavy you pointed at them oh my god look</p>
<p>a fat person we were all bone skinny</p>
<p>because we ran all day we didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know we didn&rsquo;t eat that much</p>
<p>so so so in 1977 um</p>
<p>gradually</p>
<p>through the 80s and 90s there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>push</p>
<p>to get every man woman and child on</p>
<p>snacks and snacks and snacking and eat</p>
<p>eat between the meals but before that it</p>
<p>was more of like a three salad meals</p>
<p>maybe one snack but it was more the</p>
<p>three meals and i will say even during</p>
<p>that time i mean i lived on pure junk</p>
<p>food and sugar</p>
<p>so but it was the three</p>
<p>three meals of junk food and sugar</p>
<p>so um you know the snacking is</p>
<p>definitely um</p>
<p>it is something that is um</p>
<p>a very bad thing for people</p>
<p>unfortunately they&rsquo;re stuck in it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so available isn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>available and people say to snack to</p>
<p>what prevent overeating</p>
<p>well they don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>frequency of the because what happens</p>
<p>through the day if you&rsquo;re eating that</p>
<p>many frequent meals what you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly stimulating insulin</p>
<p>every it&rsquo;s kind of like if you were to</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>six or eight times in a day</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna exercise that frequent</p>
<p>right is that gonna be better than maybe</p>
<p>two times a day or once a day</p>
<p>no you want that recovery so the</p>
<p>pancreas needs a chance to recover and</p>
<p>the frequency of eating is just deadly</p>
<p>well and i will say you can relieve</p>
<p>yourself of the burden of choice if you</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>wonderful because it&rsquo;s just off the</p>
<p>table i&rsquo;m not going to eat anything much</p>
<p>less snacks and it helps me because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m weak well this is a perfect</p>
<p>perfect example steve you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing keto exactly but you are doing</p>
<p>fasting so and you&rsquo;re still getting a</p>
<p>lot of benefits so that is</p>
<p>very interesting</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s the easier route to set</p>
<p>yourself up for keto i think because you</p>
<p>just you know you just don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>think about food for 20 hours a day</p>
<p>seems impossible to suggest such a thing</p>
<p>because i used to think about it</p>
<p>constantly but it really really works</p>
<p>you lose your hunger and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a miracle</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty amazing okay next</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>during stress anxiety and worry what</p>
<p>happens to your immune</p>
<p>t cells</p>
<p>those are the um</p>
<p>the cells that fight</p>
<p>viruses they kill cancer</p>
<p>they do a lot of things with your immune</p>
<p>system so what happens to those cells</p>
<p>during</p>
<p>times of stress worry and anxiety all</p>
<p>right very good let&rsquo;s go to georgia</p>
<p>tariq is with us and tariq if you can</p>
<p>remember to unmute yourself and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with dr bird</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>can you hear me</p>
<p>perfect perfectly</p>
<p>wonderful</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>many americans we really appreciate</p>
<p>everything that you do your passion to</p>
<p>help live</p>
<p>long</p>
<p>quality healthy life</p>
<p>appreciate it</p>
<p>my question is</p>
<p>is there a person</p>
<p>or procedures</p>
<p>that will actually</p>
<p>reduce</p>
<p>or even eliminate existing calcium</p>
<p>buildup</p>
<p>either in your heart veins or arteries</p>
<p>cardiologist recently was a small amount</p>
<p>in my mouth</p>
<p>the original vein</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real bad but i wanted to</p>
<p>address it naturally rather than</p>
<p>start using statins</p>
<p>and i refused to do that i told her so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna have to do it naturally i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>die</p>
<p>did you by chance get that coronary</p>
<p>artery calcification scan and and if you</p>
<p>did um they actually rate it on a scale</p>
<p>can you remember your number</p>
<p>oh you know i thought you might ask that</p>
<p>i went back and looked</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>q qtc is that it</p>
<p>or qr s or qt</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a little bit different</p>
<p>test so evidently</p>
<p>okay and then all right so i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>it would i i can say this i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the exact number in front of me because</p>
<p>i look for it briefly and could not find</p>
<p>it but what i did</p>
<p>what i do recall is it was still within</p>
<p>range</p>
<p>okay but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t near zero anywhere near it</p>
<p>might even maybe a third of the way</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>but but the bottom line is i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>be proactive</p>
<p>yeah i saw i saw a diagram when they</p>
<p>when i hit the test he actually had on</p>
<p>the computer uh</p>
<p>animation of it and he showed me a</p>
<p>couple of little specks of calcium</p>
<p>in my in my heart</p>
<p>okay the large artery</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i suggest with calcium</p>
<p>calcium is</p>
<p>coming in there as a band-aid</p>
<p>um to fix something you wanna you wanna</p>
<p>get to the root of it you wanna just</p>
<p>really make sure and i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing this right now make sure that you</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have any need for a band-aid</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>of course your diet should be low-carb</p>
<p>and it should be um healthy and clean</p>
<p>and all that so that way you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>the inflammation factor to cause the</p>
<p>body to deposit calcium that being said</p>
<p>one of the best protective things</p>
<p>for the inside of the arteries is the</p>
<p>tocotrienol type vitamin e supplement i</p>
<p>would highly recommend to get that and</p>
<p>then the other thing is if um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um some natural things you can</p>
<p>do to remove calcium one is vitamin k2</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that</p>
<p>helps to direct the calcium into the</p>
<p>bone and out of the soft tissues and</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ve done videos on taking a</p>
<p>chelator</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know if you would probably</p>
<p>need a key later but that would be</p>
<p>called edta it&rsquo;s a type of</p>
<p>you can get it as a kind of a supplement</p>
<p>that pulls out some of the calcium but</p>
<p>it also pulls out other minerals so you</p>
<p>want to make sure</p>
<p>if you take it you have to put back in</p>
<p>the minerals that you want so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little a little more complex i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you need to go that route but if</p>
<p>you had a lot of calcium you can do that</p>
<p>but over time</p>
<p>if you really make sure your diet is</p>
<p>correct</p>
<p>the calcium should be reabsorbed and go</p>
<p>back into the bones</p>
<p>but vitamin k2 is a</p>
<p>key factor and it just so happens that</p>
<p>most sources of k2 are</p>
<p>high fat high fat cheese butter things</p>
<p>like that the exact things that the</p>
<p>doctors are telling you not to eat but</p>
<p>you can also get it from</p>
<p>something called uh nato which is a</p>
<p>fermented soybean so there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>ways to get it but um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what i would recommend i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be on the right</p>
<p>track and the good thing is that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound like</p>
<p>your calcium is out of control but i</p>
<p>like the concept of being proactive</p>
<p>well in fact</p>
<p>he did recommend get</p>
<p>four fat soluble vitamins k2 a</p>
<p>d and e</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but but the bottom line is</p>
<p>it was inspiring to see that gentleman</p>
<p>that fasten his way out of cancer and</p>
<p>mine is not that bad but i just think</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>well first of all i see this real</p>
<p>quickly what i did was i initially</p>
<p>changed my lifestyle you know i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had any meat</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t had any pork in 50 years no</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>last time i had poultry was in 1975</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t drink a smoke but</p>
<p>looking back on it i was still consuming</p>
<p>a certain amount of carbs and sugar too</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>that was called what i&rsquo;m trying to do is</p>
<p>get it the root cause and i learned a</p>
<p>lot by looking at your videos and</p>
<p>research so i&rsquo;m trying to do things to</p>
<p>reduce my</p>
<p>insulin produced</p>
<p>in which which i found out that ldl the</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>uh cholesterol was really</p>
<p>forming plaque because of the high</p>
<p>insulin and sugar and stuff so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that i&rsquo;m trying to do to the</p>
<p>adjusting again i really really</p>
<p>appreciate</p>
<p>you doing for all</p>
<p>all of us it&rsquo;s very important hey you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the right track i like what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>okay i appreciate it but one quick</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>to me as you said</p>
<p>when you pass if you</p>
<p>anything but water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a fast but what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying is your keto suggestions like you</p>
<p>you do coffee etc etc</p>
<p>uh vinegar water</p>
<p>maybe once a day or whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that doesn&rsquo;t really hurt</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>it would not hurt my</p>
<p>uh procedure to try to reduce the</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>correct by definition a true fast is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only drinking water but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult not to do</p>
<p>something um so these other things are</p>
<p>very very minor</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>um throwing you off um it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>throw you off for more than a few</p>
<p>minutes so i think i wouldn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>they can help you they can help speed</p>
<p>things up um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s benefits to them like like tea</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>some coffee and</p>
<p>you know nutritional supplements</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know maybe a</p>
<p>green powder without the fiber</p>
<p>or apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>or a kombucha tea well kombucha tea i</p>
<p>will say does have a little bit of sugar</p>
<p>so yeah make sure you get the one that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but um yeah there&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a minor minor issue really tariq</p>
<p>thanks so much for coming on with us and</p>
<p>i hope that helped and get back with us</p>
<p>at some point and let us know how you</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>proceeding</p>
<p>we appreciate you being on okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see here</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>our quiz question the last one was</p>
<p>during stress anxiety worry what happens</p>
<p>to your immune t cells and maybe</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s been watching your videos</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a hundred percent or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re throwing it all on red they say</p>
<p>that it uh it weakens uh t-cells weaken</p>
<p>decrease or even die under stress</p>
<p>well they um they actually become</p>
<p>paralyzed they come paralyzed for two</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>now if you&rsquo;re in a chronic stress you</p>
<p>can imagine it&rsquo;s probably being</p>
<p>paralyzed more often but literally they</p>
<p>stop</p>
<p>moving they stop moving they stop</p>
<p>working that&rsquo;s your defenses so guess</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen to cancer if you</p>
<p>have cancer there&rsquo;s no more fighting</p>
<p>cancer there&rsquo;s no more fighting viruses</p>
<p>so it kind of leaves you in a state of</p>
<p>susceptibility so you&rsquo;re now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re predisposed to getting infections</p>
<p>and other problems so it&rsquo;s just it just</p>
<p>shows you the magnitude of how important</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>to do what you can</p>
<p>to keep the stress and worry anxiety to</p>
<p>a minimum i&rsquo;m going to be releasing some</p>
<p>more videos on that um but a lot of your</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>become immobile</p>
<p>and they stop working</p>
<p>the frontal cortex of your brain stops</p>
<p>firing as much as it normally does so</p>
<p>your ability to make decisions be</p>
<p>creative solve problems all go down</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in this flight or fight mode</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>a good way to counter that is to</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>start moving start moving fast get your</p>
<p>body in motion</p>
<p>start to do the opposite you know and</p>
<p>your muscles are things that you can</p>
<p>control uh breathing for example</p>
<p>your lungs don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>do the breathing it&rsquo;s the diaphragm that</p>
<p>helps push the lungs and get them</p>
<p>moving</p>
<p>so again the muscles so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great breathing technique that</p>
<p>i talk about in some of the videos to</p>
<p>get pulsum out of a panic attack</p>
<p>and then also there&rsquo;s a couple systems</p>
<p>of exercise that i really like because</p>
<p>they they combine breathing with</p>
<p>controlled movements</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re under stress you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>out of control so putting back in this</p>
<p>control</p>
<p>can greatly pull you out of stress yoga</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not talking about the philosophy</p>
<p>of yoga just the</p>
<p>physical aspects of the the workout as</p>
<p>well as pilates</p>
<p>pilates is an awesome</p>
<p>system of controlled movements with</p>
<p>breathing and it can greatly help people</p>
<p>reduce stress and feel good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s go over to</p>
<p>facebook where maria says her 84 year</p>
<p>old mother is on a lot of meds she gets</p>
<p>chronic utis i encourage her to drink</p>
<p>plenty of water and cranberry juice is</p>
<p>there anything else you&rsquo;d recommend</p>
<p>i had the same thing with my</p>
<p>mother-in-law she stayed with us and i</p>
<p>was looking at all these drugs i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what the heck is going on this is crazy</p>
<p>so we got the doc we started asking</p>
<p>questions and found out that</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re giving this person because</p>
<p>they have that i go well but this</p>
<p>medication gives you a side effect of</p>
<p>utis and they go um</p>
<p>yeah well can we start lowering some of</p>
<p>these things and so we started lowering</p>
<p>them all of a sudden her utas went away</p>
<p>uti&rsquo;s went away and</p>
<p>we found that a lot of</p>
<p>the problems that she was solving were</p>
<p>created from the other drugs that she</p>
<p>was taking so um</p>
<p>unless you reduce the medications</p>
<p>how are you going to how are you going</p>
<p>to fix the problem you&rsquo;re going to just</p>
<p>eat better i will say that the more</p>
<p>medications you are and you are on the</p>
<p>better your diet should be to counter</p>
<p>the side effects but of course that</p>
<p>would probably get rid of the need for</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>one of the</p>
<p>biggest things that i see um</p>
<p>missing in in just healthcare&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t put enough attention on on</p>
<p>the correct diet</p>
<p>might they might say well avoid</p>
<p>red meat because that&rsquo;s the worst thing</p>
<p>you can do they eat more whole grains</p>
<p>wholesome natural grains and cut down on</p>
<p>that fat and drink more water</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s um that&rsquo;s not not the best</p>
<p>way to create health unfortunately</p>
<p>all right very good why don&rsquo;t we go back</p>
<p>to our green room</p>
<p>and teresa is going to in 30 seconds ask</p>
<p>us</p>
<p>or tell us what her question is theresa</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re unmuted you&rsquo;re on with dr bird</p>
<p>oop you&rsquo;re still muted dear once you hit</p>
<p>that once more</p>
<p>is that better much perfect</p>
<p>okay hello dr berg thank you for having</p>
<p>such a generous heart you and your wife</p>
<p>you put a lot of valuable information</p>
<p>out there to the world and it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>back to you and um thank you very much</p>
<p>so my question is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i have had a growing list of health</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>and what happens is i then stop and try</p>
<p>to do the keto in intermittent fasting</p>
<p>then i can last about three weeks four</p>
<p>weeks i get all the supplements i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying everything i&rsquo;m feeling good but</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s running off</p>
<p>my willpower</p>
<p>and then it collapses</p>
<p>and then i have more health issues i</p>
<p>have gained like 25 pounds</p>
<p>i have these underlying and i remember</p>
<p>you said health issues you have to heal</p>
<p>underneath to lose the weight</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m trying but every round i go i go</p>
<p>deeper into a kind of a hole of not</p>
<p>some things not working and these health</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s these underlying health</p>
<p>things that maybe i&rsquo;m not getting to i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the issue is</p>
<p>can you just really quickly really</p>
<p>quickly tell me</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what you</p>
<p>eat when you&rsquo;re attempting keto</p>
<p>yes i eat very clean i eat the protein</p>
<p>like the amount that you see you know</p>
<p>the size of the palm of the hand i have</p>
<p>a bowl and i try to eat 10 cups of</p>
<p>vegetables i pour the olive oil or pure</p>
<p>butter and i try two times a day and</p>
<p>then drink my water and electrolyte</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>you know so it&rsquo;s really clean</p>
<p>eating and i think i have the portions</p>
<p>right you know and i don&rsquo;t i love</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>but something</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so then so then you do it and then then</p>
<p>you you start craving certain things and</p>
<p>then you go off the program</p>
<p>i do kind of crave i noticed you know</p>
<p>all um nuts or i&rsquo;ll crave um</p>
<p>sugars and i&rsquo;m always battling up</p>
<p>against the sugar thing so that when i</p>
<p>finally weaken and i have a little bit</p>
<p>of carbs or a little bit of sugar</p>
<p>yeah i mean a little bit it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a house of cards that just comes</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know so my i you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s a couple things one one</p>
<p>is um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m almost done if you just hang in</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>the new membership program i&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>has um work i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m getting with my all</p>
<p>my trained keto uh coaches to</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>fix</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re running into which is</p>
<p>working with you consistently</p>
<p>to get just the basic pattern of eating</p>
<p>in long enough for you to see the</p>
<p>results and make the transition and work</p>
<p>with you to tweak it because that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you just need someone to</p>
<p>help you keep tweaking it to tailor make</p>
<p>it to your body i think the other thing</p>
<p>that jumps out right off the bat is um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re having enough fat</p>
<p>i think you need to increase more fat</p>
<p>like pecans</p>
<p>um would be good and and even</p>
<p>have a good high quality and you make it</p>
<p>a keto dessert so that way</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t um buy something that has a</p>
<p>hidden crap in there like you make it</p>
<p>with the right sweeteners and all that</p>
<p>and then start having start doing that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not giving up something and you</p>
<p>have a something you fall back on</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the other than that i think</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re running into you just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it long enough to be able</p>
<p>to convert over so now the appetite goes</p>
<p>away and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re winning on it</p>
<p>and you and getting to that state is</p>
<p>like being obviously tough for you so</p>
<p>i think what i would do right now is get</p>
<p>some pecans</p>
<p>or other nuts that you like and start</p>
<p>adding that at the end of the meal and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>make a really good keto dessert so you</p>
<p>feel like you&rsquo;re getting something sweet</p>
<p>but of course don&rsquo;t buy it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to find a</p>
<p>you know pre-made keto dessert without</p>
<p>the all these hidden things that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>approve of</p>
<p>you know i interestingly i do buy the</p>
<p>peak i go to costco i have the the</p>
<p>pecans i do the the dessert bombs but i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re saying something</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m the type that needs what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying a level of coaching</p>
<p>to get me through properly because</p>
<p>i sincerely try</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not not turning the corner and</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t find that level of coaching to</p>
<p>get me</p>
<p>through so what do i look for</p>
<p>when when are you offering that or</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>if you if you&rsquo;re um watching my videos</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re on my my list um on some</p>
<p>email list uh you&rsquo;ll get a notification</p>
<p>real soon i mean i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m putting a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of time and upgrade to</p>
<p>this membership site with with the help</p>
<p>of the coaching to to really um</p>
<p>get someone&rsquo;s basic eating completely</p>
<p>correct</p>
<p>and tailor-made and implemented</p>
<p>over a period of few weeks to and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really kind of what you need is some</p>
<p>some hands-on</p>
<p>back and forth until you just nail it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be surprised um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of finding that thing</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden it works</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>i think if you just hang in there a</p>
<p>little bit longer we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll have this</p>
<p>done i mean this is i&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>day every day on this thing so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>almost there i just have to upload a few</p>
<p>more videos and then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re good to go</p>
<p>perfect thank you and then one just</p>
<p>quickly you know i&rsquo;ve had things like i</p>
<p>live under chronic stress i had thyroid</p>
<p>problems sugar</p>
<p>sugar problems kidney stones</p>
<p>osteoporosis</p>
<p>afibulation i mean</p>
<p>now this virus of</p>
<p>has surfaced after a billion years like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a non-stop train ride of these</p>
<p>things coming to the surface am i still</p>
<p>able to do this with all those kind of</p>
<p>issues i had thyroid cancer you know</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s going to be just a</p>
<p>little bit more difficult but i i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to actively and</p>
<p>aggressively</p>
<p>uh do things to counter this stress and</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>evaluate where is it really coming from</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>confront the heck out of it because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the stress thing is is a killer and so</p>
<p>um if you do that um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to force yourself get</p>
<p>outside every day go for the long walk</p>
<p>do these</p>
<p>you know lemon balm tea but but other</p>
<p>than that too is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to address</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s chronically putting you in</p>
<p>the stress day because that alone will</p>
<p>inhibit your results but there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things you can do</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um hang in there and um</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;re almost going to release</p>
<p>that soon so that&rsquo;s great teresa thanks</p>
<p>so much for joining us uh let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>the next quiz question doc here it is</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>poor sleep can make you infertile</p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>all right audience</p>
<p>grab on to that let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>a social media reread from youtube i had</p>
<p>a hysterectomy in my early 30s and now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in my 60s i&rsquo;m trying intermittent</p>
<p>fasting but i can&rsquo;t get into ketosis</p>
<p>could a hysterectomy be a factor</p>
<p>it potentially could that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>major trauma and it does cause</p>
<p>stress on the adrenals after the surgery</p>
<p>and also the adrenals back up the</p>
<p>ovaries</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>um video i have on this topic and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cut there&rsquo;s a supplement that</p>
<p>i would recommend from a company called</p>
<p>standard process called utrophin</p>
<p>pmg</p>
<p>if you took that</p>
<p>i think it could help you because in</p>
<p>practice i used to recommend that as a</p>
<p>supplement if someone had a hysterectomy</p>
<p>and they seem to do really good because</p>
<p>it supplies the body uh things of things</p>
<p>are missing</p>
<p>um because now you have a missing organ</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s called eutrophin pmg by standard</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>terrific let&rsquo;s go back to the green room</p>
<p>this time we&rsquo;re going to go to michelle</p>
<p>who is coming to us from new jersey the</p>
<p>land of pizza michelle you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>thanks so much and and dr burke thank</p>
<p>you so much for all of the valuable</p>
<p>videos and you know all of the</p>
<p>information that you put out there the</p>
<p>supplements i&rsquo;ve been using have been</p>
<p>fantastic and very helpful so thank you</p>
<p>for everything that you do um so my</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know in regards to the betaine hcl</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve followed a lot of what you were</p>
<p>saying in in regards to you know gerd</p>
<p>and you know i have had this you know</p>
<p>sensation in the back of my throat like</p>
<p>that there was something there of course</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been and um had a scope the</p>
<p>whole nine yards they said that you know</p>
<p>it was likely that it was gerd but no</p>
<p>heartburn or anything like that of the</p>
<p>sort but i was taking the betaine acl</p>
<p>had kind of you know worked up to</p>
<p>getting to be you know taking six per</p>
<p>meal and you know intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and keto as well so two meals a day and</p>
<p>was doing that for quite some time from</p>
<p>january actually and just recently i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started having these bouts of heartburn</p>
<p>which have been waking me up in the</p>
<p>middle of the night and you know also</p>
<p>late after my second meal so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering is that a sign that it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>to you know kind of start reducing that</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the typical time frame that</p>
<p>you know someone is usually taking that</p>
<p>betaine hcl because i understand from</p>
<p>your videos that you know once you get</p>
<p>that level of stomach acid up you know</p>
<p>the body is is you know just recycling</p>
<p>that i think as you called it so</p>
<p>you know at what point is enough enough</p>
<p>and you know how do you know when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to reduce that</p>
<p>well you know when uh you had enough</p>
<p>when you start getting heartburn</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>if you stop taking that and everything</p>
<p>clears up then we know for a fact if you</p>
<p>stop taking your heartburn gets worse</p>
<p>then we need to um reevaluate and go</p>
<p>wait a second um</p>
<p>maybe you need um something more for the</p>
<p>probiotics something lower</p>
<p>um in the digestive tract uh but i think</p>
<p>i would just stop checking and if it</p>
<p>goes away then we know you&rsquo;re done like</p>
<p>you you already built up your hcl so uh</p>
<p>because it isn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not a forever</p>
<p>product you just build it up and then</p>
<p>you stop taking it</p>
<p>okay gotcha and what i continue to still</p>
<p>take um like the enzymes i take the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula i don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder so that&rsquo;s something that i</p>
<p>take when i continue taking something</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s something you might want to</p>
<p>continue to take because you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a gallbladder and so you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>concentration of bile but now that i</p>
<p>know you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder um</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>the only time i would say stop taking</p>
<p>the gallbladder or bile salts when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>is when</p>
<p>you might have too much bile and a good</p>
<p>symptom of that would be diarrhea or a</p>
<p>loose bowels then like okay so because</p>
<p>because if you have too much mild it can</p>
<p>cause diarrhea so you back off on that</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s not the case then</p>
<p>keep taking that um</p>
<p>that gallbladder support formula um</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of one of those things you</p>
<p>just have to kind of</p>
<p>uh watch more of my videos and</p>
<p>understand like what&rsquo;s happening and</p>
<p>adjust this versus that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but i think um right now i would stop</p>
<p>the detain and see if that fixes</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>excellent super we&rsquo;ll definitely do that</p>
<p>and one um last question too you know</p>
<p>since shifting to you know follow keto i</p>
<p>do the healthy clean ketos as much as</p>
<p>humanly possible despite our</p>
<p>conversation on pizza before</p>
<p>but you know i&rsquo;ve had this symptom of</p>
<p>having an extremely dry mouth for a very</p>
<p>long time and you know it&rsquo;s gotten to</p>
<p>the point where i&rsquo;m now using the xyla</p>
<p>melts to try to you know because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s driving me</p>
<p>insane so is there is there something</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m missing you know nutrition wise</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s causing you know me to have</p>
<p>that dry mouth at night in the morning</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fine it&rsquo;s just throughout the day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting drier and drier</p>
<p>dry mouth</p>
<p>potentially could be</p>
<p>you need more fluids however</p>
<p>it could also be a lack of vitamin a</p>
<p>vitamin a will cause both dry mouth and</p>
<p>sometimes even dry eyes so because it</p>
<p>affects the the superficial mucous</p>
<p>membranes on the inside of your body</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so vitamin a now why would you be</p>
<p>deficient vitamin a well</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough gold</p>
<p>bile from because the gallbladder&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>there so even though you have the bile</p>
<p>maybe what you need to do is start</p>
<p>beefing up your vitamin a and just so</p>
<p>happens that</p>
<p>um liver is a good source of vitamin a</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>is butter and</p>
<p>what else</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>raw milk dairy has vitamin a</p>
<p>cod liver oil has vitamin a</p>
<p>these are things that i would i would</p>
<p>try</p>
<p>um and then with that bile salt that</p>
<p>should help you</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s say you did that and it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t fully handle it um</p>
<p>it could be that you do need to increase</p>
<p>your fluids maybe with some more</p>
<p>electrolytes just to get more hydrated</p>
<p>and then maybe add a little more sea</p>
<p>salt in there so these are just things i</p>
<p>would i would test and look at and think</p>
<p>think with as i was trying to solve that</p>
<p>all right great thank you so much</p>
<p>michelle uh good luck with all that and</p>
<p>as with all our guests and agreeing we</p>
<p>ask that</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve tried some different things</p>
<p>and progressed please give us a ring</p>
<p>back and let us know how you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with all that that&rsquo;s a important</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s conducted by you other</p>
<p>research was done by the audience who</p>
<p>has answered the recent question which</p>
<p>asks true false sleep can make you</p>
<p>infertile</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>98 of respondents say it&rsquo;s true and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a two percenter holding out</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>well um it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s true because of</p>
<p>what it does to cortisol and increases</p>
<p>cortisol and cortisol</p>
<p>inhibits uh your fertility</p>
<p>inhibits the endocrine system</p>
<p>testosterone in men and females it can</p>
<p>alter uh certain sex hormones so</p>
<p>yeah one one if someone&rsquo;s infertile</p>
<p>um they should really look also at their</p>
<p>stress level and address that um i have</p>
<p>so many videos</p>
<p>on stress and i&rsquo;m gonna release another</p>
<p>one in a couple days</p>
<p>but um it&rsquo;s one factor that we all have</p>
<p>to address but a little stress is</p>
<p>essential a lot of chronic stress is</p>
<p>not good and so</p>
<p>we have to work at</p>
<p>dealing with that too because so many</p>
<p>people like are in a chronic state of</p>
<p>anxiety or worry and they just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to get out of it</p>
<p>like i said before because the immune</p>
<p>system becomes paralyzed your</p>
<p>your brain tends to you get brain freeze</p>
<p>writer&rsquo;s block all sorts of</p>
<p>things happen with your cognitive</p>
<p>function it takes a</p>
<p>a low stress environment</p>
<p>to have a lot of creativity to solve</p>
<p>problems to have enough</p>
<p>space to really you know</p>
<p>um come up with the right solutions too</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stress can really mess someone up in</p>
<p>many different levels</p>
<p>all right well we have someone from</p>
<p>tunisia moab</p>
<p>is coming to us and moab if you there</p>
<p>you go you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>uh hello everyone it&rsquo;s a great honor dr</p>
<p>berg to be here with you</p>
<p>with the other amazing guys sharing</p>
<p>their experiences</p>
<p>uh personally i would like to speak</p>
<p>about my experience i started doing ketu</p>
<p>diet and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>six months ago</p>
<p>it was a life-changing experience i lost</p>
<p>20 kilos of</p>
<p>fat</p>
<p>but now i&rsquo;m trying to build some muscle</p>
<p>tissue</p>
<p>and continue uh losing</p>
<p>losing fat because i still have some</p>
<p>belly fat</p>
<p>it seems to be a little bit difficult</p>
<p>for me because i can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a great</p>
<p>relation between</p>
<p>continuing the process of losing fat</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>starting building</p>
<p>muscle effectively</p>
<p>i want to get a general</p>
<p>information about</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>maintaining</p>
<p>losing fat and starting</p>
<p>building a muscle effectively how should</p>
<p>i work out which foods am i allowed to</p>
<p>eat and others not</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>yeah i think the the key to the muscle</p>
<p>building has to be a</p>
<p>a really good exercise program that</p>
<p>involves</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>low reps heavier weight</p>
<p>uh and</p>
<p>you know i</p>
<p>i always recommend this you can always</p>
<p>have a personal trainer push you further</p>
<p>than you can push yourself</p>
<p>and someone that is can really coach you</p>
<p>on that aspect but you definitely need</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>do a full body workout um</p>
<p>and then as far as having enough energy</p>
<p>to do that with the calories that you</p>
<p>eat so you&rsquo;re gonna have to increase the</p>
<p>quantity of food um i i wouldn&rsquo;t if you</p>
<p>realize this the leanness has to do with</p>
<p>the carbohydrate so you might have to go</p>
<p>lower carb and then</p>
<p>maybe to keep the volume up of calories</p>
<p>to have the energy</p>
<p>increase the fat and even some more</p>
<p>protein which will then</p>
<p>help balance things out but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily</p>
<p>want to build muscle with eating just</p>
<p>more protein that&rsquo;s not going to do it</p>
<p>and if you eat more carbs that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to build more fat so we want to get a</p>
<p>low carb we want to go maybe a little</p>
<p>more protein more fat low carb does it</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>only a fruit a day or should i eat oat</p>
<p>or brown rice or no no you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do any of that you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>grains you don&rsquo;t want to do fruits</p>
<p>because then that&rsquo;s the sugar and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to turn down and turn the sugar</p>
<p>fast and that&rsquo;s going to keep you fat</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>in my videos</p>
<p>uh when you study on insulin</p>
<p>uh the more that something increases</p>
<p>insulin the more that you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be able to burn fat so we want to</p>
<p>eliminate all these triggers to insulin</p>
<p>so then you can get lean because we want</p>
<p>to force your body to use up your own</p>
<p>fat</p>
<p>by keeping those carbs as low as</p>
<p>possible and there&rsquo;s a really i think a</p>
<p>good video for you</p>
<p>to watch would be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something um don&rsquo;t quote me but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s keto on steroids</p>
<p>and i think i did one keto and steroids</p>
<p>updated</p>
<p>that might be a good one for you to</p>
<p>watch because</p>
<p>um i think that&rsquo;s what you need right</p>
<p>now uh especially for the education</p>
<p>is it the one with thomas de lauer</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s a different one</p>
<p>oh okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>should i uh i started doing uh two meals</p>
<p>in order to uh</p>
<p>to build uh some muscle uh in the first</p>
<p>meal i always try to have some little</p>
<p>carbs under protein</p>
<p>in the second meal after workout uh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aiming for</p>
<p>the same amount of protein and a little</p>
<p>bit of fat would that be sufficient</p>
<p>what kind of carbs are you eating</p>
<p>sometimes fruit one fruit</p>
<p>other times some oats</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah i would go back to my videos</p>
<p>because we talk about</p>
<p>fruits are not on the plan and</p>
<p>oats are not on the plan i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>but yeah you&rsquo;re going to have to change</p>
<p>the carbohydrate to a big salad</p>
<p>a delicious big salad with</p>
<p>olive oil and</p>
<p>vinaigrette if you want and then that</p>
<p>way and other vegetables too but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the carbohydrates that you want to</p>
<p>consume</p>
<p>more of not the fruit</p>
<p>okay moab listen we&rsquo;re about out of time</p>
<p>so i hope you got something uh</p>
<p>productive out of that and we&rsquo;ll look</p>
<p>forward to hearing from you again</p>
<p>uh dr berg we have arna which her</p>
<p>picture has been a little tough but arna</p>
<p>can you hear us why don&rsquo;t you go ahead</p>
<p>with your question</p>
<p>arna can you hear us</p>
<p>i think her connection is still spinning</p>
<p>so unfortunately yeah okay well listen</p>
<p>um dr berg we&rsquo;re just about out of time</p>
<p>i think something really important is</p>
<p>for you to emphasize once again</p>
<p>uh how great product availability is</p>
<p>becoming internationally you want to</p>
<p>talk about that for a minute</p>
<p>well uh if you&rsquo;re like me um you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like paying as much for shipping when</p>
<p>you get order products so um we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly trying to</p>
<p>reduce the shipping cost so now we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>different areas of the world so you can</p>
<p>look down below and get some links if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not in america to not have to pay</p>
<p>the expensive new</p>
<p>shipping</p>
<p>costs</p>
<p>but on that note i just really</p>
<p>appreciate all your wonderful comments</p>
<p>and your great successes stay tuned for</p>
<p>more</p>
