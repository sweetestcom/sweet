Good afternoon, everyone. Sorry.
I&amp;rsquo;m Ann Harrison.
I&amp;rsquo;m the dean at the Haas School of Business.
Welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s Dean Speaker Series.
I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to introduce and welcome back
today&amp;rsquo;s speaker Michael Smith who&amp;rsquo;s our MBA,
one of our own from 1986.
Michael earned his MBA from Berkeley in marketing
and finance after earning his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in science,
technology and society from that school
that shall not be named, Stanford University.'>

    <p>(people murmur)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the dean at the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean Speaker Series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to introduce and welcome back</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s speaker Michael Smith who&rsquo;s our MBA,</p>
<p>one of our own from 1986.</p>
<p>Michael earned his MBA from Berkeley in marketing</p>
<p>and finance after earning his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in science,</p>
<p>technology and society from that school</p>
<p>that shall not be named, Stanford University.</p>
<p>As a leader who consistently questions the status quo,</p>
<p>Michael says of himself that he would prefer</p>
<p>to build, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next,&rdquo; over managing, &ldquo;what is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael joined NPR in 2020 as their chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>He set out to ensure that both the NPR audience and content</p>
<p>reflects the diversity of America.</p>
<p>As a media executive who has spent his career</p>
<p>finding new ways for people to consume content</p>
<p>across an recently diverse audience population,</p>
<p>Michael is uniquely qualified to take on the role</p>
<p>and the challenge at NPR.</p>
<p>He has more than 30 years of experience in entertainment</p>
<p>brand content, digital and revenue generating</p>
<p>brand extensions and he&rsquo;s held prior leader roles</p>
<p>at both digital channels for scripts, networks</p>
<p>and cooking channel and food category brand extensions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also held roles at the Food Network,</p>
<p>Disney channel and CBS.</p>
<p>Thank you so much Michael for taking the time</p>
<p>to speak with us today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very grateful to have you and have you back</p>
<p>because we know you were here last year at this time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so great to have an alum here in the room with us,</p>
<p>at least virtually in the room with us,</p>
<p>and we really look forward to an informative discussion.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to turn over the conversation</p>
<p>Mukundha Sastry and Elsa Mora, who are both part</p>
<p>of our full-time MBA program and they will lead</p>
<p>the conversation.</p>
<p>After that conversation is over you will also</p>
<p>have an opportunity to ask some questions,</p>
<p>so take it away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to be here today, Mike.</p>
<p>I am a first year full-time student.</p>
<p>I came from media and entertainment.</p>
<p>I am a co-president of the digital media</p>
<p>and entertainment club, as well</p>
<p>as the business Latin X club.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also part of Consortium.</p>
<ul>
<li>And thank you again, Michael.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Mukundha.</p>
<p>I am a second year in the full-time program.</p>
<p>I also come from media and entertainment and super excited</p>
<p>to share your love of entertainment with this community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it&rsquo;s great.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just exciting to be back.</p>
<p>Anytime anybody from Haas asks me for anything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so excited &lsquo;cause it was definitely,</p>
<p>maybe this is an overstatement,</p>
<p>but it was a transformational time in my life</p>
<p>when I was in business school and just love</p>
<p>to reconnect whenever I can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lovely.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go ahead and, dive right into the questions.</p>
<p>So the first one is, you know, you&rsquo;re CMO of NPR,</p>
<p>you have had a very successful career.</p>
<p>Do you wake up and just pinch yourself</p>
<p>and think, how did I get to this position?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I do feel lucky.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think anybody who works in the media and entertainment</p>
<p>business should feel lucky.</p>
<p>I mean, we get to do things around things</p>
<p>that most people consider to be like,</p>
<p>if you say entertainment, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up, you know, watching television</p>
<p>and reading the newspaper and listening to the radio</p>
<p>and just enjoying it as a consumer.</p>
<p>And to think that, you know,</p>
<p>what I get to do every day is just make the things</p>
<p>that I actually consume and like yeah, it&rsquo;s a treat.</p>
<ul>
<li>And Michael, there are several folks here in the room</li>
</ul>
<p>that are really excited about joining a career in marketing.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll see that across Haas we have several students</p>
<p>interested in product, in sales,</p>
<p>particularly product marketing.</p>
<p>For someone who, for those of us who might be interested</p>
<p>in entering those types of careers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious to hear from you your career in marketing,</p>
<p>what is the day in the job of a CMO look like?</p>
<p>Could you tell us what was on your calendar yesterday</p>
<p>and some important meetings and sort of what&rsquo;s on your mind</p>
<p>on a day to day basis?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and one of the thing, nice things</li>
</ul>
<p>about marketing is that no two days are the same.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that the mission of what you do is the same.</p>
<p>I mean, our job is to connect more people</p>
<p>to our content and again, into our brand.</p>
<p>But what you do on a day to day basis really varies.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re the voice of the audience</p>
<p>throughout the organization.</p>
<p>You know, I always like to use this sort of framework</p>
<p>when you think of media organizations</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s about five key functions that they perform.</p>
<p>The first is that they make content,</p>
<p>then they package the content up, you can call it product.</p>
<p>Then they figure out how to distribute that product,</p>
<p>where to put it and then the fourth thing they do</p>
<p>is to promote and market the product.</p>
<p>And then the final thing is to actually figure out ways</p>
<p>to monetize and make money off that product.</p>
<p>And we are in that, you know, we&rsquo;re the promotion</p>
<p>and marketing people but we also are part</p>
<p>of the audience intelligence apparatus within the company,</p>
<p>which informs the content at making and informs distribution</p>
<p>decisions and also informs our sales,</p>
<p>our ad sales department that monetizes the content.</p>
<p>So I get involved in a lot of different conversations</p>
<p>across all these parts of the company.</p>
<p>I mean, you specifically to your question about</p>
<p>what was on my calendar.</p>
<p>I was in a meeting with our distribution team</p>
<p>talking about our, actually it&rsquo;s our product</p>
<p>and distribution team talking about the NPR One app,</p>
<p>which is our audio app that we&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>to help people consume our radio stations and our podcasts.</p>
<p>And we were just having some conversation</p>
<p>about how to evolve that app and brand that app</p>
<p>and whether we wanted to have two apps or one app</p>
<p>or what kind of features we wanted to have in the app</p>
<p>and what our consumer intelligence tells us about that.</p>
<p>And then I had another meeting which was about</p>
<p>our organizational structure,</p>
<p>was how we structured marketing</p>
<p>and audience insights and our business development team,</p>
<p>which is another group that I oversee</p>
<p>which deals with our licensing and brand extensions,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the best way to structure those.</p>
<p>I also oversee our design team</p>
<p>and we do design around our marketing communications,</p>
<p>but we also do design around our products as well</p>
<p>and their conversations about line between UX design</p>
<p>say, and brand design.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a variety of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a lot of designers and product enthusiasts</li>
</ul>
<p>in the room.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s ever any a time that Haas students</p>
<p>can help out with these product ideations,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re open.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great. - Yeah,</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the interesting things I know</p>
<p>from what I first got out into the media business</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s evolved as, you know,</p>
<p>I talked about the content and then the product</p>
<p>or packaging part of it and then the promotion</p>
<p>and distribution,</p>
<p>but that packaging part was not as salient,</p>
<p>you know, 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, media product was,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a movie or a television show</p>
<p>or a radio broadcast and there wasn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>a package around it.</p>
<p>I mean, there was, you saw it on a movie screen</p>
<p>or on a television set or maybe there was a sort</p>
<p>of a CD package or a record or something</p>
<p>that you could hold in your hand,</p>
<p>but the digital era has created this whole new thing</p>
<p>called an app.</p>
<p>And the app is the package, you know,</p>
<p>that you experience the media content in.</p>
<p>And for, I think for consumers that experience</p>
<p>of how the product is packaged within the app is, you know,</p>
<p>almost in, for some products like a TikTok, you know,</p>
<p>obviously is even more important sometimes</p>
<p>than the content itself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an exciting thing I&rsquo;ve seen happen</p>
<p>over the last 30 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, you know, we have heard how you have transitioned</p>
<p>from different roles and all the companies</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve have worked in.</p>
<p>How do you tackle going and working at a new company</p>
<p>and smoothing out that transition</p>
<p>from role to role, from company to company?</p>
<p>Is there any research that you do,</p>
<p>any set of criteria or any set of steps</p>
<p>that you sort of as a ritual undertake</p>
<p>before and while you&rsquo;re newly joining a company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, you know when I was a student,</li>
</ul>
<p>I was one of those sort of, you know,</p>
<p>pull all nighters cram before the final kind people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way I used to address joining a new company</p>
<p>was to kind of pull in all nighter</p>
<p>and try to learn everything you possibly could.</p>
<p>But I had some really great advice from a boss of years ago,</p>
<p>a mentor that, you know, you need to take</p>
<p>that pressure off yourself and realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be working at the organization</p>
<p>for hopefully a very long time.</p>
<p>And to give it time.</p>
<p>You know, the organizations are very multi-layered</p>
<p>and nuanced and you&rsquo;re probably gonna have better insights</p>
<p>and opinions on what to do after you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>for two months or three months and you&rsquo;ve had a chance</p>
<p>to really understand the organization</p>
<p>than you will on day one.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t, you know, beat yourself up</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;ve gotta know everything the day you walk in.</p>
<p>So I try to get myself time in the first couple of months</p>
<p>just to listen, you know, just learn and walk around,</p>
<p>meet as many people within the organization at all levels</p>
<p>and people who have been there 20 years,</p>
<p>people who are new and just try to understand</p>
<p>the anthropology of the place first</p>
<p>and then try to apply some of the lessons and, you know,</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;ve picked up over the years</p>
<p>and things I learned at Haas you know,</p>
<p>to the circumstance that I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<ul>
<li>So specifically for NPR, you undertook</li>
</ul>
<p>this sort of approach.</p>
<p>What were some of the findings and who were some</p>
<p>of the people that you were speaking to</p>
<p>that helped illuminate your path forward?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, one of the first things I did</li>
</ul>
<p>and when I was, before I started was I went back</p>
<p>and read a lot of thesis papers that students like,</p>
<p>you know, you guys have projects where you do, you know,</p>
<p>do cases on companies and there&rsquo;s some really good ones</p>
<p>that student have done over the years on NPR.</p>
<p>And so I read some of them, you know,</p>
<p>analyzing the company and its history.</p>
<p>And I also looked at the, so the original founding documents</p>
<p>for NPR, the original mission statement.</p>
<p>And I realized that they were written by a guy</p>
<p>named Bill Siemering who created,</p>
<p>who was one of the first program director,</p>
<p>actually was the first program director for NPR.</p>
<p>And I, you know, just on a lark, just reached out to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s retired, he&rsquo;s in his, you know, in his 80s</p>
<p>and he was so gracious to spend time with me</p>
<p>through email and just on the phone talking</p>
<p>about the founding of NPR and what his vision was years ago.</p>
<p>And it just really helped me again, back</p>
<p>the anthropology get to stand the sort of DNA</p>
<p>of the organization.</p>
<p>And then I did that with conversations,</p>
<p>through conversations with other long time people</p>
<p>on the journalism side and other employees</p>
<p>just to kinda understand, you know, where,</p>
<p>especially with an organization that&rsquo;s been around</p>
<p>for a long time, you know, how we got to where we are,</p>
<p>which helps create just a better understanding</p>
<p>of the context in which whatever change we need to make</p>
<p>is going to occur in.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like that you&rsquo;re elaborating and articulating</li>
</ul>
<p>on these themes of just listening, learning context,</p>
<p>understanding culture, sort of the environment</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going into.</p>
<p>In this room where you&rsquo;re speaking to it&rsquo;s MBA students,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all excited to be in this environment</p>
<p>and sort of learn as much as we can,</p>
<p>but half of us are about to go out into the real world</p>
<p>and graduate and get full-time careers.</p>
<p>What are some of the best takeaways</p>
<p>that you might have for us as we sort of go</p>
<p>into our next jobs?</p>
<p>And what do you think we should be thinking about</p>
<p>as we sort of look for that next opportunity,</p>
<p>or if we have secured that opportunity,</p>
<p>how can we sort of bring our best selves</p>
<p>to that new environment?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think the perennial challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>for an MBA student is the, you know,</p>
<p>the edict of like follow your passion</p>
<p>is what people have always said, you know, for years.</p>
<p>You know, first find your passion,</p>
<p>hopefully in some time in business school</p>
<p>through your internships and classes,</p>
<p>you gotta find the thing that you think you really wanna do</p>
<p>and then follow your passion.</p>
<p>But then follow that within the constraints of,</p>
<p>you know two years of incredible expenses</p>
<p>and student and loans hanging over your heads.</p>
<p>So.. - We really.</p>
<ul>
<li>So that&rsquo;s, but I was a student that was, you know,</li>
</ul>
<p>everybody was going to Wall Street</p>
<p>because that was where the big money was</p>
<p>even though might been have where their passion was.</p>
<p>You know, looking back years later,</p>
<p>I think what you really should do is find the thing that,</p>
<p>you know, if you had won the lottery tomorrow</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have to work for money, what would you just do?</p>
<p>You know, what would you just do</p>
<p>because you enjoyed it and try to find something closer</p>
<p>to that.</p>
<p>Because I think if you&rsquo;re better motivated</p>
<p>and more excited about what you do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to have more success in that career</p>
<p>and ultimately more financial reward than jumping</p>
<p>at the thing that has the great starting salary</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really love but you think it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>pay down your loans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a career you might start and then sort of stall out,</p>
<p>you know, after a few years.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s kind of figure out, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book years ago called</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Color Is My parachute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that thing about, you know, what, yeah,</p>
<p>what is the thing that really, you know,</p>
<p>makes you want to get up in the morning</p>
<p>that you wanna go do?</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s hard to find sometimes,</p>
<p>but hopefully, you know, the two years here in school</p>
<p>and through internships and through informational interviews</p>
<p>and networking with people, you can get a better sense</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>And then also don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if you know</p>
<p>that first job or two, you know, after b school,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t exactly the perfect fit &lsquo;cause that&rsquo;s also part</p>
<p>of that journey, figuring out where you really need to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to that point then I guess,</li>
</ul>
<p>so those are some of the successful things</p>
<p>we should be looking for.</p>
<p>But what about some of the mistakes that you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>from newly minted MBA grads or perhaps MBAs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen in the workforce?</p>
<p>What are things that we can be actively looking out for</p>
<p>that we should perhaps think otherwise about?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think sometimes people, you know,</li>
</ul>
<p>will chase the herd like, oh, everyone&rsquo;s going to work in,</p>
<p>you know, Web3 or everyone&rsquo;s going to work in AI or,</p>
<p>and without saying, you know, what is it</p>
<p>that you really want to do?</p>
<p>And then also not researching the culture</p>
<p>of the organization is that you&rsquo;re going into deeply enough</p>
<p>to make sure that there&rsquo;s really a fit in alignment</p>
<p>with who you are.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve seen change over the years.</p>
<p>I know when I was younger, it was more like,</p>
<p>you know, bootcamp.</p>
<p>We just figured just get a job at, you know,</p>
<p>one of these big name companies, because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it stamps your ticket for future success.</p>
<p>And you put up with a lot of things in the culture</p>
<p>and we worked with that you felt like</p>
<p>it was almost like a badge of honor</p>
<p>to just kinda get your feet in the door.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right. - And I think now</li>
</ul>
<p>people are demanding no, you know,</p>
<p>you know, I have a lot of knowledge, I have a lot of skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a tight labor market right now</p>
<p>so you guys have a lot of leverage</p>
<p>and let me be more selective and ask people about, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m really going be getting into.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the media landscape as we know is constantly evolving.</li>
</ul>
<p>And even when you started in your position,</p>
<p>the world, the pandemic had really taken full force.</p>
<p>How have these changes informed and shaped your strategy</p>
<p>and how do you think your strategy</p>
<p>is working out two years into the job?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think the pandemic has just accelerated things</li>
</ul>
<p>that were already in motion.</p>
<p>You know, I think the two sort of meta trends</p>
<p>that have been going on in media, you know,</p>
<p>probably the last 50 years have been one,</p>
<p>the change in technology and how people engage</p>
<p>with the content.</p>
<p>You know, from whether it&rsquo;s from broadcast TV,</p>
<p>to cable, to the internet, you know,</p>
<p>from movies to streaming.</p>
<p>And then the other big meta change has been</p>
<p>the increasing diversification of America.</p>
<p>I mean, when NPR started 1970, you know,</p>
<p>over 80% of Americans were white.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think less than 6% were,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re Latin X and 9% we&rsquo;re African American.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re in a country, you know, that&rsquo;s about 60/40</p>
<p>and you look at people under the age of under 35, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, almost a majority minority country.</p>
<p>So, those two things, those two forces have been,</p>
<p>you know, relentless through time.</p>
<p>And those are the things I think all media companies</p>
<p>are struggling to react to, you know,</p>
<p>the changing ways people consume</p>
<p>and the changing nature of the consumer.</p>
<p>And I think for NPR that&rsquo;s been a challenge</p>
<p>and an exciting opportunity for us.</p>
<p>You know, our mission and why we were created,</p>
<p>it was really to, you know, provide an alternative</p>
<p>to commercial media and to sort of serve</p>
<p>the media needs of the country that aren&rsquo;t being served</p>
<p>by the commercial system.</p>
<p>And to talk about the stories that, you know,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t always covered, to represent groups who aren&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>depicted and to really reflect America.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, in fact that&rsquo;s the north star</p>
<p>of our company strategy right now is to really,</p>
<p>really be a true reflection of the audience that we serve.</p>
<p>And then secondly, you know, we started as a,</p>
<p>primarily as a radio broadcast company.</p>
<p>And over time how people consume audio</p>
<p>has really evolved, you know, digitally.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, people string radio,</p>
<p>they listen to audio through smart speakers.</p>
<p>You know, they listen to podcasts and, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been at the forefront of innovation in those spaces,</p>
<p>but that has been, you know, an important shift</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had to adapt and hopefully, you know,</p>
<p>can leverage towards our mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>And do you find that in your search</li>
</ul>
<p>to broaden and diversify the base</p>
<p>that you are navigating a difficult challenge</p>
<p>in retaining and catering to the needs</p>
<p>of your previous base whose demographics</p>
<p>and needs are substantially perhaps different?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know the nice thing for us is that,</li>
</ul>
<p>you know, we reach people through radio</p>
<p>but we also reach them digitally through stream,</p>
<p>through audio streams and more significantly</p>
<p>through podcasts.</p>
<p>And the audience is, if you look at the podcasting audience</p>
<p>versus the radio audience, they are very</p>
<p>different demographically.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been nice to be able to serve a whole new</p>
<p>audience without alienating an old audience.</p>
<p>So, for example, you know, there are people</p>
<p>who are older and less diverse who listen</p>
<p>to Morning Edition every day on the radio.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a whole new generation of people who listen</p>
<p>to Up First, which is our podcast morning news show,</p>
<p>which is, you know, one of the most popular</p>
<p>daily podcasts in the country.</p>
<p>But the audience of Up First is, you know,</p>
<p>our people in their 20s and 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very diverse audience,</p>
<p>much more diverse than the radio audience</p>
<p>which tends to be older.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to, you know, introduce content</p>
<p>that serves the next gen audience but we also, you know,</p>
<p>put a lot of investment into the traditional Morning Edition</p>
<p>radio show that serves the traditional audience</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I think it&rsquo;s an interesting point just to think about</li>
</ul>
<p>even audiences and how different audiences are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at a really unique point in sort</p>
<p>of the entertainment landscape in this country</p>
<p>and around the world where there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the proliferation of every single company</p>
<p>putting out their own type of content product.</p>
<p>How do you think NPR sort of stays independent</p>
<p>from all of that chatter?</p>
<p>Because I think consumers are probably expressing loyalty</p>
<p>to two or three services where they&rsquo;re sort of getting all</p>
<p>their entertainment options from,</p>
<p>how do you envision NPR sort of staying independent,</p>
<p>sort of clear of all that chatter and that noise?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think being a nonprofit</li>
</ul>
<p>and being mission driven really helps us because, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not just chasing clicks or chasing eyeballs</p>
<p>for just pure revenues sake.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really, you know, chasing a mission</p>
<p>which is we have a belief that, you know,</p>
<p>the more informed and aware and intelligent</p>
<p>the American population is the better</p>
<p>it is for our democracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better for civility. - Right.</p>
<ul>
<li>And just in just the harmony within our society.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of why I think public media exists.</p>
<p>And so our, you know, higher goal is to grow</p>
<p>the amount of people that engage and are touched</p>
<p>by our content and to make sure that that we&rsquo;re reaching,</p>
<p>you know, the full spectrum of America.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, not about, you know,</p>
<p>being the number one service or, you know,</p>
<p>competing with this guy or with, you know, with that guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about making content that we feel like can,</p>
<p>you know, enrich people and making more people aware</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>We feel like we&rsquo;re really a really unique moment in time</p>
<p>where you know, we think about the polarization</p>
<p>in the United States, all the misinformation,</p>
<p>the low trust in media that, you know, people</p>
<p>are looking for, you know, accurate,</p>
<p>trusted, respected, you know, balanced fact based</p>
<p>enriching content.</p>
<p>And I think the surprising thing I think</p>
<p>to me when I came to NPR was that when you think</p>
<p>about the brand awareness of NPR it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the 30s.</p>
<p>You know, almost 65% of the Americans</p>
<p>are not aware of the brand which will surprised</p>
<p>a lot of people probably, you know, in our circles</p>
<p>and kind of more highly educated circles.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge swath of the population</p>
<p>that we need to reach by just making them aware of,</p>
<p>you know, this really quality content that we have.</p>
<p>And we found that when we put it in front of people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re presently surprised,</p>
<p>like I never heard of that but this is amazing stuff.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what gets me excited every day.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s an interesting point because I think of,</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly encourage everyone in the room</p>
<p>and those listening to follow Michael on LinkedIn</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s an avid LinkedIn poster</p>
<p>and really enjoys posting about entertainment trends.</p>
<p>And Michael you posted recently about CNN+</p>
<p>and sort of how there is a larger awareness</p>
<p>for a different demographic.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s interesting how you&rsquo;re kind of delineating</p>
<p>that NPR is mission driven versus CNN is obviously driven</p>
<p>by being a publicly traded company as part of the larger</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery entity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious just as Americans consume news</p>
<p>and NPR strives to sort of be that independent</p>
<p>mission driven oasis for those that seek it,</p>
<p>what would you say does the next five</p>
<p>to 10 years look like for that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think the next five to 10 year years for us</li>
</ul>
<p>is about getting our content onto more platforms</p>
<p>and also kind of rethinking the formats of our content.</p>
<p>You know, we were pretty, we had one format for almost 35,</p>
<p>almost 40, our first 40 years</p>
<p>which was a long form radio show.</p>
<p>And one in the morning called Morning Edition,</p>
<p>one in the afternoon, you know,</p>
<p>called All Things Considered.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;ve really been innovating with different forms</p>
<p>of content that still provide the same benefit</p>
<p>and sort of the same mission.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s, you know, a 10 minute podcast</p>
<p>or a 30 minute podcast, or Insta,</p>
<p>a one minute Instagram video, or a two minute TikTok video</p>
<p>which are things that we&rsquo;re doing right now,</p>
<p>you know, in the culture space,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always been a place where you could listen to,</p>
<p>you know, and discover outstanding artists,</p>
<p>sometimes undiscovered and underappreciated artists.</p>
<p>And we would have radio shows where you would hear,</p>
<p>you know, jazz concerts or classical concerts.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve really been innovating on YouTube</p>
<p>with short concerts and concerts in a very unplugged,</p>
<p>unstructured way.</p>
<p>And we started a series where the concerts</p>
<p>are actually performed in front of a small desk</p>
<p>in our office called the Tiny Desk Concerts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, become one of our most popular</p>
<p>content outlets.</p>
<p>So I think that more video, more short form,</p>
<p>things in different kinds of platforms,</p>
<p>just experimenting with all the ways that you can enlighten</p>
<p>and enrich and inform people.</p>
<ul>
<li>One last question before we switch gears</li>
</ul>
<p>just pertaining to entertainment and media.</p>
<p>So again, Michael, I&rsquo;ve talked to you about how this room</p>
<p>and sort of the broader Haas community in general,</p>
<p>their aspiring consultants, folks interested in product,</p>
<p>big tech, real estate, finance, you name it, social impact.</p>
<p>What would be your elevator pitch to Haasies and beyond</p>
<p>for entering a career in this space</p>
<p>where this is perhaps more of a smaller industry</p>
<p>preference and choice for those entering.</p>
<p>How can we convince Haasies and broader MBAs</p>
<p>to sort of consider a career in entertainment and media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think entertainment media,</li>
</ul>
<p>if you think about the impact that it has in people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s grown over the last say 30 or 40 years,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re definitely working</p>
<p>in a part of industry that, you know, makes a difference</p>
<p>and really has an influence of on the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a growth industry.</p>
<p>You know, I, you think about the number of people.</p>
<p>I think the US Labor Department data would back this up</p>
<p>who worked in media entertainment say in 1972</p>
<p>to who work in it today.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s exploded.</p>
<p>In fact, you know, the Nielsen data shows,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is good or bad for our culture,</p>
<p>but the amount of time people spend with media, you know,</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s over eight or nine hours a day.</p>
<p>You know, when do they work, when do they sleep?</p>
<p>But that continues, you know, that continues</p>
<p>to grow continually.</p>
<p>I think as people have, you know,</p>
<p>more devices in front of them, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on their phone while they&rsquo;re got Netflix streaming</p>
<p>in the background, you know, while they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>their AirPods in their ears listening to a podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;re in a business that is, you know,</p>
<p>exploding in size and scale with an increasing</p>
<p>societal impact and importance.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s one of the exciting things</p>
<p>about being in the business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a fun one Mike,.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your LinkedIn profile you state that, you know,</p>
<p>a little about many things and a lot about</p>
<p>what you still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What are some of those topics that you are not</p>
<p>very knowledgeable in and how do you go</p>
<p>about bridging that knowledge gap?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think NFTs.</p>
<p>(everyone chuckles)</p>
<p>Crypto, I would say cryptocurrency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wallets. - Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>CRISPR gene editing.</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of different,</p>
<p>I have a real, you know, polymath who just,</p>
<p>I just curious about a lot of different things</p>
<p>but I think because I&rsquo;m so curious about so many things</p>
<p>I tend to not go deep on many things.</p>
<p>So I have a long list of things I wish, you know,</p>
<p>like books I wish I could read or lectures</p>
<p>I wish I could attend, but I&rsquo;m really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why my undergraduate degree was</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called science, technology and society.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the intersection</p>
<p>of culture and tech.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why things like, you know,</p>
<p>the metaverse are, you know, super interesting to me.</p>
<p>And just having time to go deep on that stuff though</p>
<p>because it is, you know, so nuanced and complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>So as we think about our careers long term,</li>
</ul>
<p>something that Elsa and I talked a lot about</p>
<p>in preparing for today is we both come from environments</p>
<p>that were largely homogenous in the entertainment</p>
<p>media industry.</p>
<p>And as both of us as professionals of color</p>
<p>coming from the entertainment world, it was tough.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy to sort of look around and not find people</p>
<p>that look like us or executives that sort of were advocates</p>
<p>and champions of our own progress.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re even more delighted that you&rsquo;re here with us</p>
<p>to sort of share on your journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious to hear from you about,</p>
<p>especially for candidates of color dealing with primarily</p>
<p>homogenous environments, what types of questions should</p>
<p>we be asking of our future employers,</p>
<p>whether it be entertainment, media, or anything beyond,</p>
<p>any industry beyond to ensure our own psychological safety</p>
<p>in the workforce, and to ensure that we are set up</p>
<p>for success to continue growing</p>
<p>and being the best versions of ourselves?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;re at a really exciting time because,</li>
</ul>
<p>you know, when I got into the business in the late 80s,</p>
<p>early 90s, I mean, you know, there weren&rsquo;t a lot of</p>
<p>Mukundha&rsquo;s does and Elsie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You know, even just the names, you know.</p>
<ul>
<li>So true. - Like Bobs and Carols.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it just the feeling of inclusion</p>
<p>was so different then.</p>
<p>I mean, we were just people, you know, my generation,</p>
<p>I think we were just happy to have a foot in the door</p>
<p>and not even, you know, be at the stage to say,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying, like to demand that, you know,</p>
<p>that there be inclusion or what are you doing</p>
<p>to make people like me feel safe and comfortable.</p>
<p>We were just like, just happy that we&rsquo;re the first ones</p>
<p>to even be in these companies.</p>
<p>But, you know, hopefully we paved away</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;ve gotten to a stage where yeah,</p>
<p>you can ask those kinds of questions.</p>
<p>You can say, you know, wait a minute, it&rsquo;s not just about,</p>
<p>do you have a few people in your company,</p>
<p>but, you know, what&rsquo;s your culture?</p>
<p>You know, is it just part, is it woven into the fabric</p>
<p>of your culture, inclusion and diversity.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so much nicer today,</p>
<p>is that just the way people dress, the way they speak,</p>
<p>the, you know, the hairstyles,</p>
<p>to that you can just show up as yourself</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really about just the work.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re mate is it a good podcast?</p>
<p>Is it a good movie?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, are you making things</p>
<p>that resonate with the audience and who cares about,</p>
<p>you know, how you, you know, how you dress or,</p>
<p>you know, or all these other sort of superficial things</p>
<p>that people used to use to really segregate</p>
<p>and discriminate against people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you can kind of tell when you walk into companies</p>
<p>too, do they feel very homogenous,</p>
<p>or do you just get, do you just see,</p>
<p>but, you know, a sense of diversity?</p>
<p>I mean, one way to dig deeper is just beyond, you know,</p>
<p>the company website and the couple people</p>
<p>that you interview, you know, ask, you know,</p>
<p>to speak to a few different employees in the company,</p>
<p>three or four different employees.</p>
<p>If you can ask if you can come on site, you know</p>
<p>and walk into the lunchroom and just look</p>
<p>around the company and get a sense of who&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You know, seek out people maybe on LinkedIn, who, you know,</p>
<p>were former employees the company to get, you know,</p>
<p>a perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it really be, do the due diligence</p>
<p>to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>And to that point, I guess, how do you as Michael Smith</li>
</ul>
<p>show up authentically to work every day at NPR as a CMO?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, yeah, I, it&rsquo;s one of the places</li>
</ul>
<p>that I felt that the ability to be the most authentic</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m kind of a, you know a,</p>
<p>I guess we call me kind of a nerdy sports fan guy</p>
<p>who likes to, you know, wear this kind of casual clothes</p>
<p>but be sort of brainy too.</p>
<p>And I dunno if you guys watch Food Network,</p>
<p>there was a guy named Alton Brown who&rsquo;s on Food Network</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s sort of very similar, I guess,</p>
<p>sort of to the personality of myself.</p>
<p>And when I came to NPR I found there were a lot of people</p>
<p>that were just naturally like that.</p>
<p>There was, NPR is sort of like a company of like,</p>
<p>it feels like graduate students and college professors</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t get tenure and ended up making radio shows.</p>
<p>But you know really, you know, really,</p>
<p>and really committed, dedicated journalists,</p>
<p>just people who are committed to helping other people</p>
<p>understand the world better and are just comfortable</p>
<p>with being themselves and doing that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really, I feel a fantastic organization</p>
<p>in being able to show up as yourself.</p>
<p>But not all, yeah all companies are like that.</p>
<ul>
<li>And it&rsquo;s really reassuring to hear that,</li>
</ul>
<p>that you can find that in future corporate environments.</p>
<p>Something that we talk a lot about at Haas</p>
<p>especially within the student body</p>
<p>is sometimes just the feeling of imposter syndrome,</p>
<p>feeling like you don&rsquo;t belong or feeling like sometimes</p>
<p>you maybe not be as good enough as your peers</p>
<p>or your fellow classmates, and that can often get</p>
<p>to your head and it can cripple you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious in your role as a CMO</p>
<p>of such a large organization, have you ever felt</p>
<p>that imposter syndrome or that feeling</p>
<p>of fear of how can you keep up with sort of the demands</p>
<p>of the role, and what are some ways</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;ve overcome that if you have felt it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about that</p>
<p>when you guys provided that in advance</p>
<p>about imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>And I think maybe it&rsquo;s a factor of just the age we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>When I was coming up, I didn&rsquo;t feel a sense</p>
<p>of imposter syndrome because there was so few people</p>
<p>like myself and it seemed to be such a challenge</p>
<p>to overcome pre, you know, preconceived biases</p>
<p>against people of color into what your potential could be.</p>
<p>So it, I didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of people thinking</p>
<p>that I was more than I was and I was an imposter.</p>
<p>It was more, they, you kind of had to prove</p>
<p>to them that you weren&rsquo;t what they thought you were</p>
<p>and that you actually were smarter than and were capable.</p>
<p>You could say that today, there are so many</p>
<p>more opportunities.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s never been a better time.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t long from perfect</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never been a better time to be a person of color</p>
<p>going into business and companies really are, you know,</p>
<p>leaning in and looking to diversify and looking</p>
<p>for, you know, highly qualified people of color.</p>
<p>And so, you know, sometimes that focus and,</p>
<p>you know, people patting on the back and saying, oh,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>And, you know, and you know, we&rsquo;re trying to diversify</p>
<p>and we really need you and then you get brought in</p>
<p>and you probably do feel like, oh my God,</p>
<p>you know, am I really as good as I think that I am?</p>
<p>But yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that.</p>
<p>I mean, I still think that the general tenor</p>
<p>within the American industry is to still underestimate and,</p>
<p>you know, somewhat marginalized the abilities</p>
<p>of people of color.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still gonna need to, you know,</p>
<p>to prove people wrong.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t ever, you know, feel like you&rsquo;re not worthy,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you are, and you&rsquo;re more worthy than probably</p>
<p>most people believe, around you believe that you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>One other question since we spoke about having done</li>
</ul>
<p>due diligence prior to working at a company,</p>
<p>certainly you did.</p>
<p>You spoke to employees but you were still</p>
<p>from the outside looking in.</p>
<p>Definitely not the companies, but I&rsquo;m speaking</p>
<p>specifically about NPR.</p>
<p>What were some of the findings that, you know,</p>
<p>you only really gained insight to once you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>that may have surprised you that you didn&rsquo;t expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and within NPR.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, one of the things that surprised me was</p>
<p>the length of tenure that people,</p>
<p>a lot of companies in media and if you read, you know,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Variety&rdquo; or &ldquo;Deadline Hollywood,&rdquo; or, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of the trades, there&rsquo;s a lot of turnover</p>
<p>in the industry.</p>
<p>People jump from company to company,</p>
<p>people tend to, you know, work in someplace</p>
<p>for a couple years and then they&hellip;</p>
<p>And I found that just, you know, anecdotally that like</p>
<p>the average tenure of an NPR employee</p>
<p>was at least eight years.</p>
<p>You know, many people 10, 15, 20 years.</p>
<p>So that was a surprise to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, what is about,</p>
<p>what is it about this place that people</p>
<p>are working here for such a long time?</p>
<p>You know, because, you know, it&rsquo;s a nonprofit</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not necessarily that people are making, you know,</p>
<p>outrageous salaries, but there&rsquo;s some reason</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re dedicating, you know,</p>
<p>the majority of their careers to this place.</p>
<p>And so that was intriguing.</p>
<p>And, you know, as I found out, it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>really about that emotional and sort of spiritual reward</p>
<p>that you get about knowing that the work you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you know, is having such a positive impact on the world,</p>
<p>it has a, you know, a meaning,</p>
<p>you know, a deeper meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost at time for audience Q&amp;A,</p>
<p>but before we do that I just wanted</p>
<p>to thank you again Michael for always being</p>
<p>such a consistent advocate for people of color,</p>
<p>for executives, for sort of amplifying talent</p>
<p>in any way you can.</p>
<p>It really, it just, it&rsquo;s so wonderful to see and experience.</p>
<p>And for those who may not know,</p>
<p>Michael just casually responded to a LinkedIn request</p>
<p>that we had sent him and sort of that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>he participated with us today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just so lovely that you&rsquo;re such a wonderful</p>
<p>source of support and guidance and mentorship for us here</p>
<p>at Haas and we just really appreciate</p>
<p>all that you do for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, thank you very much for having me</li>
</ul>
<p>and you know, what a great credit to the two of you</p>
<p>and the rest of your teammates on having these kinds</p>
<p>of opportunities for students to, you know,</p>
<p>to hear other perspectives and hopefully get some advice</p>
<p>that helps them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>So Michael, we don&rsquo;t want, we&rsquo;re hoping you can stay</li>
</ul>
<p>with us a little bit longer because we wanna give</p>
<p>the students in the room or the audience</p>
<p>the opportunity to ask some questions.</p>
<p>Would that be okay with you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>I loved questions.</p>
<p>I was one of, when I was a student,</p>
<p>I was one of the ones in annoyed my professors</p>
<p>with endless questions.</p>
<p>So- - So if you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to ask a question, you can go to the mic behind you</p>
<p>and identify yourself.</p>
<p>If someone would like to&hellip;</p>
<p>While she&rsquo;s walking towards the mic,</p>
<p>let me just say in my own words</p>
<p>how much I appreciate NPR and everything that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you over the years the number of times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my car listening to an episode,</p>
<p>I get home and I just stay in my car riveting, you know,</p>
<p>by whatever it is I&rsquo;m listening to.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t leave, you know, what I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>on National Public Radio.</p>
<p>So over the years it&rsquo;s just been so amazing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just so grateful for NPR.</p>
<p>So on that note, did you wanna ask a question?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Nina.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this on?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the mic on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name is Nina.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year full-time MBA student</p>
<p>And you I&rsquo;m just feeling very triggered</p>
<p>about having to graduate in a month or so.</p>
<p>One of my questions is when you&rsquo;re a news organization,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re obviously tasked with having to deliver</p>
<p>some heavy news, like, you know,</p>
<p>the world is kind of dark right now,</p>
<p>but NPR seems to do a beautiful job of centering joy</p>
<p>and connection and empathy in its voice,</p>
<p>even while it&rsquo;s talking about really complex topics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to know as future leaders of organizations,</p>
<p>how does that joy and empathy and connection translate</p>
<p>to things you you&rsquo;ve seen take place, you know,</p>
<p>in the office and what can we do as future leaders</p>
<p>to ensure that no matter what industry</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working in, we&rsquo;re also, you know,</p>
<p>carrying ourselves in ways that honor empathy</p>
<p>and joy and connection?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think one of, (clears throat)</li>
</ul>
<p>one of the hallmarks of NPR&rsquo;s journalistic style</p>
<p>is to, you know, tell stories through the voices</p>
<p>of the people who are experiencing</p>
<p>the thing that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>you know, rather than from just the reporter editorializing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one of the unique things you can do</p>
<p>with an audio because of the intimacy of the medium.</p>
<p>And so we let the stories unfold, you know,</p>
<p>through the people experiencing it</p>
<p>which I think that allows you to you know,</p>
<p>feel the poignancy but also feel the hope</p>
<p>in the people who are telling the story,</p>
<p>you know, whether&hellip;</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something you can translate into,</p>
<p>you know, how you work with your peers</p>
<p>and your employees is to, again, going back</p>
<p>to that listening thing and just platforming</p>
<p>the voices of people internally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that, you know,</p>
<p>NPR really does walk that walk internally.</p>
<p>You know, that the number of what we call</p>
<p>sort of listening spaces that we have</p>
<p>within the organization where we get employees together</p>
<p>to talk about, you know, whether it&rsquo;s diversity issues</p>
<p>or the hybrid work issues, work-life balance issues,</p>
<p>just have spaces where employees can moderate</p>
<p>and spaces to talk about issues amongst themselves.</p>
<p>And it just, you know, creates this culture</p>
<p>where no matter what your role in the organization</p>
<p>you feel like there&rsquo;s a place for you to have your voice,</p>
<p>you know, recognized.</p>
<p>And so I think keeping an eye on that as a leader</p>
<p>is important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesome, I thought that was an awesome question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Nina.</p>
<p>My question is a little bit different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about competitors.</p>
<p>So you mentioned talking about TikTok and you mentioned,</p>
<p>and kind of some other players who I was</p>
<p>a little bit surprised about actually.</p>
<p>So I was kind of curious how you think about NPR</p>
<p>in terms of various competitors,</p>
<p>especially new ones like Spotify and others</p>
<p>who are kind of popping up as content creators,</p>
<p>new content creators?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, the competition thing is, you know, to me,</li>
</ul>
<p>is very nuanced because it being,</p>
<p>as a nonprofit we&rsquo;re not necessarily, you know,</p>
<p>competing against the &ldquo;New York Times&rdquo;</p>
<p>or the &ldquo;Washington Post,&rdquo; you know, for our audience.</p>
<p>I mean, if you step back for a second and you say, you know,</p>
<p>if our mission is to create a more informed public</p>
<p>and sort of fill the gaps that commercial media, you know,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fill, you could argue that</p>
<p>if somebody already has a &ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; subscription</p>
<p>or an &ldquo;FT&rdquo; subscription and reads the &ldquo;Washington Post,&rdquo;</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re a person who&rsquo;s pretty well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re well educated.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not really well, you know,</p>
<p>the core of why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to help that person,</p>
<p>you know, doesn&rsquo;t have access to that information,</p>
<p>you know, who can really be empowered</p>
<p>by having that kind of information.</p>
<p>And so, you know, where we compete with them</p>
<p>is more in terms of the resources to do what we need to do.</p>
<p>So we do earn a significant amount of resources</p>
<p>through sponsorship sales or advertising you call it,</p>
<p>the sponsors to fight messaging in our content.</p>
<p>You know, we do get membership donations from people.</p>
<p>So to the extent that people are consuming</p>
<p>the &ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; and not us, then that may, you know,</p>
<p>harm our advertising revenue to the extent</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re paying for &ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; subscriptions,</p>
<p>you know, maybe that this reduced the amount</p>
<p>of money they have to donate to NPR.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not as, you know, direct one to one,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re sitting there paying attention</p>
<p>to how many clicks they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>versus how many clicks we&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, Michael.</p>
<p>This is Dimple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an alum of the Haas School,</p>
<p>and also have looked at Michael as a mentor over the years.</p>
<p>I come from the media industry.</p>
<p>We met in New York a number of years ago</p>
<p>through are the Haas alumni network.</p>
<p>So I definitely encourage you all to stay in touch</p>
<p>with the network.</p>
<p>My question for you Michael today</p>
<p>is one thing I know about you is that you&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been super innovative wherever you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>in terms of pushing strategy forward</p>
<p>in a very unique way that hasn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>been introduced to C-levels in the organizations</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve worked for.</p>
<p>And I think that part of your magic there is this sort</p>
<p>of quiet charisma that you have and as leaders</p>
<p>and future leaders in this room, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna have to work with folks</p>
<p>who we have to find strategic ways</p>
<p>to getting through to them.</p>
<p>How have you done that?</p>
<p>You know, what are those, you know, personality traits</p>
<p>or, you know, maybe there&rsquo;s a story</p>
<p>of a time you were trying to get something pushed through</p>
<p>and, or an idea accepted.</p>
<p>How did you go about that?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, thanks there Dimple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely, yeah.</p>
<p>Great to see you again.</p>
<p>The key list lesson I&rsquo;ve learned is the value</p>
<p>of relationships and just human connection.</p>
<p>I think when I came outta school,</p>
<p>just give you guys guys some perspective.</p>
<p>You know, I went straight through from undergrad</p>
<p>into business school.</p>
<p>So I hadn&rsquo;t worked at all, you know full time</p>
<p>when I got into the business world.</p>
<p>So I believed you know, my success had been</p>
<p>because of my academic success.</p>
<p>You know, I have the smartest idea and, you know,</p>
<p>biggest brain and then that&rsquo;s gonna win.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s kind of happens when you&rsquo;re in school.</p>
<p>And I learned the hard way over years</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not having the best strategy or the best idea</p>
<p>and just trying to, you know, pound your fist on the table</p>
<p>and drill it in the people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>It really is about winning their hearts</p>
<p>and understanding okay, I&rsquo;ve got an idea.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the best idea but how can I connect</p>
<p>with this person and you know just listen to them</p>
<p>and understand and where they&rsquo;re trying to go.</p>
<p>And, you know, we can kind of get there together</p>
<p>in coming to this understanding that was&hellip;</p>
<p>And a lot of it is building that relationship capital</p>
<p>with people through just, you know, popping your head</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s office, having coffee with them, you know,</p>
<p>shooting a breeze about North Carolina Duke,</p>
<p>you know game or what happened on &ldquo;Real Housewives&rdquo;</p>
<p>or whatever, just building that equity with people</p>
<p>will get you to, you know, get your ideas through</p>
<p>a lot more than, you know, fantastic PowerPoint</p>
<p>and a great, you know, explanation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause people tend to do things I think a lot because of,</p>
<p>you know, their hearts over their heads.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Michael.</li>
</ul>
<p>Love the conversation so far.</p>
<p>My question&rsquo;s a little bit more so</p>
<p>on the creator economy per se.</p>
<p>There are a lot of content creators,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re TikToks or podcasts, whatsoever,</p>
<p>and they have very different ways of making a living,</p>
<p>making money and being more mainstream.</p>
<p>What are the ways that you have seen creators</p>
<p>make this living and sort of what revenue streams</p>
<p>have been there and how do you see them changing</p>
<p>over the past few years and maybe in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think the revenue streams around entertainment,</li>
</ul>
<p>you know, have not really changed in principle from,</p>
<p>I tell students this all the time, if you go back to the,</p>
<p>the ancient Roman chariot races.</p>
<p>You know, they had the kind of two</p>
<p>or three key revenue generating things</p>
<p>if you look at those races in the Coliseum,</p>
<p>they sold tickets to the event.</p>
<p>They had banners like, cloth banners hanging</p>
<p>in the Coliseum with names of little,</p>
<p>you know, little businesses on them.</p>
<p>And then they, you know, sold little statues</p>
<p>of the chariot racers outside, little wood cart statues.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you make great content,</p>
<p>you can monetize it either by charging people for it,</p>
<p>you know, subscriptions.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re a creator, I guess,</p>
<p>you know, you have a Substack</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got a Patreon channel.</p>
<p>You get people give you money.</p>
<p>Or you can because of the attention</p>
<p>that you draw based on what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you can get other people to pay for that attention,</p>
<p>which is advertisers, sponsors, you know,</p>
<p>people that wanna reach your audience.</p>
<p>And then the third is, you know, you can use your,</p>
<p>you know, brand and IP and likeness to create other kinds</p>
<p>of products, you know, merchandise.</p>
<p>T-shirts, hats, you know, other things, you know,</p>
<p>experiences and that kind of monetization model</p>
<p>has been around I think, you know,</p>
<p>as long as entertainment has been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that now, you know, technology enables</p>
<p>more complex ways to do that.</p>
<p>So instead of selling a T-shirt or a hat, you know,</p>
<p>a Jackson Brown concert which is something</p>
<p>I bought 35 years ago.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re buying, you know, an NFT from, you know,</p>
<p>a Kanye West livestream, you know.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just understanding</p>
<p>that the, if you do make content,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got those three different ways that you can monetize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Emily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>This has been great.</p>
<p>As a marketer I had a question for you</p>
<p>about brand awareness which you had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I was really surprised to hear how, you know,</p>
<p>relatively low the brand awareness of NPR is.</p>
<p>I was curious as CMO, how do you go about increasing</p>
<p>brand awareness especially considering</p>
<p>the increasing political polarization of people in the US</p>
<p>and the separate media bubbles that people live in?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it, well, I think the biggest</li>
</ul>
<p>for brand awareness for an organization like us</p>
<p>is just financial resources.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get huge brand awareness if you,</p>
<p>you know, spend the money to buy, you know,</p>
<p>the access to see people&rsquo;s time, so buying advertising.</p>
<p>We have more limited resources so we&rsquo;ve gotta rely more</p>
<p>on taking the things that people are already engaged with</p>
<p>and cross-promoting other things that they might be</p>
<p>interested in, you know, trying to use</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s platforms.</p>
<p>The great thing is people do have a lot of trust</p>
<p>and respect and for our brand.</p>
<p>So, you know, things as simple as having our reporters</p>
<p>and hosts on other people&rsquo;s shows.</p>
<p>You know, getting social shares of our content</p>
<p>in front of new people.</p>
<p>So, but to your question about</p>
<p>the bubbles and the polarization,</p>
<p>I have a kind of contrarian view on this whole bubble thing.</p>
<p>You know, I think that, you know,</p>
<p>we have more diversity in media outlets and media sources</p>
<p>and access to media than in ever in history.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone can be a publisher.</p>
<p>Everyone can have a Twitter feed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more discourse, public discourse</p>
<p>than there&rsquo;s ever been in world history.</p>
<p>So the fact that there&rsquo;s dispute</p>
<p>and polarization and people have different opinions to me,</p>
<p>is not new in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we had civil war in the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we&rsquo;ve had, you know,</p>
<p>we had colonization and empires.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like a thousand years ago</p>
<p>the world was this honky dory place</p>
<p>where everybody just agreed and sang kumbaya together.</p>
<p>So I actually look at it the other way.</p>
<p>I think that we are at, we actually have more,</p>
<p>you know, diversity and more inclusion</p>
<p>and more harmony than ever before because I think that,</p>
<p>the image people have in the past is that, yeah,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>dispute between the Republicans and Democrats</p>
<p>or there, you know, between mainstream American</p>
<p>and within mainstream American culture.</p>
<p>But what they forget is that there were big groups of people</p>
<p>who were just excluded from mainstream American culture.</p>
<p>So yeah, you know, all the, you know,</p>
<p>cisgender straight white men all agreed</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t was no, you know,</p>
<p>Native Americans didn&rsquo;t have a story.</p>
<p>You know, gender non binary people didn&rsquo;t have a story,</p>
<p>African Americans didn&rsquo;t have, nobody else was at the table.</p>
<p>So you could say, yeah, we all agreed.</p>
<p>It was a great American.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden where everyone&rsquo;s sitting at the table,</p>
<p>finally, we&rsquo;re starting to sit at the table</p>
<p>and people are upset that, well, wait a minute,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re polarized.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why we don&rsquo;t agree anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, because you didn&rsquo;t let us</p>
<p>in the room before to disagree with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah. - Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Michael.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Tarik Glenn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually an undergraduate student.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a junior at Haas right now.</p>
<p>And first off, I just wanted to thank you for coming back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very motivational seeing a black man</p>
<p>come back and pour back into the students.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to ask you being in such a successful role</p>
<p>and being a black man, what would,</p>
<p>what advice could you give me for someone</p>
<p>like a young black man who&rsquo;s aspiring</p>
<p>to be in a similar position like you but having</p>
<p>to overcome adversity during that process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing you talked about, thank you for that comment.</p>
<p>You know, it just made me think about</p>
<p>how far we&rsquo;ve come in terms of progress.</p>
<p>When I finished at Haas I remember being asked to come back,</p>
<p>it was maybe like only a year or two after finishing</p>
<p>to talk to students, to be an inspiration to them.</p>
<p>But this is a time when there were hardly any black students</p>
<p>at Haas and so some guy who is 26 years old,</p>
<p>who works in New York is considered to be an inspiration</p>
<p>to the few students that we had.</p>
<p>And now I guess it takes you know, being the CMO</p>
<p>of NPR to be&hellip;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Shows that we&rsquo;ve come a long, that there&rsquo;s a lot more people</p>
<p>like you out there, which is fabulous.</p>
<p>But yeah, to your question about,</p>
<p>you know, how I guess keys to success.</p>
<p>You know, I think that the one lesson</p>
<p>this was taught to me years ago is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this arc that happens, especially for black men,</p>
<p>male leaders that we tend to not do as well in career</p>
<p>advancement early on but then tend to do well</p>
<p>later in our careers.</p>
<p>And that the paradox is because oftentimes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re younger there&rsquo;s this sort of</p>
<p>these preconceptions and you know, stereotypes about you</p>
<p>and so people tend to pass you over for opportunities.</p>
<p>But you keep your head down and you keep learning</p>
<p>and you keep getting better and you keep getting stronger</p>
<p>and people who get the chances ahead of you flame out.</p>
<p>And then what happens often, this happened in my career.</p>
<p>They come back to you later down the line and say,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re still here.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>We got this big, the house is on fire.</p>
<p>We tried everybody else and you know what?</p>
<p>Okay, put this guy in and you know.</p>
<p>And then because you&rsquo;ve been preparing,</p>
<p>you actually knock it out of the park</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s happened to me</p>
<p>multiple times my career, but, you know.</p>
<p>So I think that that fact sometimes that we are overlooked</p>
<p>it though creates a quiet strength</p>
<p>and it creates something that people,</p>
<p>I think hopefully now are realizing that,</p>
<p>that we need to tap into more.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello, Michael.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also an undergrad student here at Haas</p>
<p>studying business and media studies.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the pieces of knowledge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve shared with us this far.</p>
<p>A question that I have for you is,</p>
<p>as you have navigated your journey for over 30 years,</p>
<p>early on in your career what helped you develop a niche</p>
<p>and kind of have that clarity in pursuing your,</p>
<p>like the role that you&rsquo;re currently at,</p>
<p>or do you see that come in and kind of,</p>
<p>how do you navigate that journey?</p>
<p>I would say personally for me, I&rsquo;m currently, you know,</p>
<p>as an undergrad student seeking to develop</p>
<p>my marketing aspirations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit of a challenge to kind</p>
<p>of find that niche and see where I can merge my passions</p>
<p>and my talents.</p>
<p>So what advice would you have for someone</p>
<p>who is currently navigating that space?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, thanks for the question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that you can&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>what you like to do unless you do a lot of stuff, you know.</p>
<p>So I knew I&rsquo;d like being around entertainment,</p>
<p>but I did, I tried to just do it.</p>
<p>When I was undergraduate I started this group called</p>
<p>the Campus Entertainment Board where we just</p>
<p>we put on concerts with local bands that we would get</p>
<p>from San Francisco and bring &rsquo;em out to campus.</p>
<p>And we, put, you know, throw parties and put on plays.</p>
<p>And you know, I played in a rock band for a little while.</p>
<p>I just did a lot of things and then those things actually</p>
<p>kind of helped me get a sense for what my niche was.</p>
<p>I realized like I wasn&rsquo;t the best musician.,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t the best actor, I wasn&rsquo;t the best, you know,</p>
<p>singer, but I was really good at like,</p>
<p>kind of putting together the thing, the event.</p>
<p>Like making the connection about like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the artist that we should have on stage</p>
<p>at this a party and how much should we charge</p>
<p>for the tickets and who should we invite</p>
<p>and how can we make it really popular?</p>
<p>So I realized I like the idea of how</p>
<p>to like connect people to entertainment,</p>
<p>how to make them like, like promoting it,</p>
<p>making people wanna like it and come and engage with it.</p>
<p>And by doing that, I got to be around people</p>
<p>who are much more talented than me,</p>
<p>better guitar players, better actors or whatever,</p>
<p>but my role was to like make a spotlight shine on them.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I found my niche.</p>
<p>Now, you know, maybe if I had found that I was, you know,</p>
<p>a super great musician then I would&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>I wanted to be, you know, a producer or writer</p>
<p>or the creator themselves.</p>
<p>But so I think that&rsquo;s where you kind of</p>
<p>can sense it by just trying stuff out.</p>
<p>Get involved in entertainment projects at the school level,</p>
<p>with your friends and other people</p>
<p>and then you kind of see where you shine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much, Michael.</p>
<p>I think we are out of time and I just wanna thank you</p>
<p>for your wonderful answers to all these questions</p>
<p>and also for your great optimism.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re really just have a vision</p>
<p>which is so inspiring to me and so positive in so many ways.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for coming back to Haas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very grateful to you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
