    <p>The following is a conversation with Dmitry Korkin,</p>
<p>his second time in the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of bioinformatics</p>
<p>and computational biology at WPI,</p>
<p>where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex disease,</p>
<p>computational genomics, systems biology,</p>
<p>and biomedical data analytics.</p>
<p>He loves biology, he loves computing,</p>
<p>plus he is Russian and recites a poem in Russian</p>
<p>at the end of the podcast.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that to me,</p>
<p>the scientists that did the best apolitical,</p>
<p>impactful, brilliant work of 2020</p>
<p>are the biologists who study viruses without an agenda,</p>
<p>without much sleep, to be honest,</p>
<p>just a pure passion for scientific discovery</p>
<p>and exploration of the mysteries within viruses.</p>
<p>Viruses are both terrifying and beautiful.</p>
<p>Terrifying because they can threaten</p>
<p>the fabric of human civilization,</p>
<p>both biological and psychological.</p>
<p>Beautiful because they give us insights</p>
<p>into the nature of life on Earth</p>
<p>and perhaps even extraterrestrial life</p>
<p>of the not so intelligent variety</p>
<p>that might meet us one day</p>
<p>as we explore the habitable planets</p>
<p>and moons in our universe.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Dmitry Korkin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often said that proteins</p>
<p>and the amino acid residues that make them up</p>
<p>are the building blocks of life.</p>
<p>Do you think of proteins in this way</p>
<p>as the basic building blocks of life?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>So the proteins indeed is the basic unit,</p>
<p>biological unit that carries out</p>
<p>important function of the cell.</p>
<p>However, through studying the proteins</p>
<p>and comparing the proteins across different species,</p>
<p>across different kingdoms,</p>
<p>you realize that proteins are actually</p>
<p>much more complicated.</p>
<p>So they have so called modular complexity.</p>
<p>And so what I mean by that is an average protein</p>
<p>consists of several structural units.</p>
<p>So we call them protein domains.</p>
<p>And so you can imagine a protein as a string of beads</p>
<p>where each bead is a protein domain.</p>
<p>And in the past 20 years,</p>
<p>scientists have been studying</p>
<p>the nature of the protein domains</p>
<p>because we realize that it&rsquo;s the unit.</p>
<p>Because if you look at the functions, right?</p>
<p>So many proteins have more than one function</p>
<p>and those protein functions are often carried out</p>
<p>by those protein domains.</p>
<p>So we also see that in the evolution,</p>
<p>those proteins domains get shuffled.</p>
<p>So they act actually as a unit.</p>
<p>Also from the structural perspective, right?</p>
<p>So some people think of a protein</p>
<p>as a sort of a globular molecule,</p>
<p>but as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>is the globular part of this protein is a protein domain.</p>
<p>So we often have this, again,</p>
<p>the collection of this protein domains</p>
<p>align on a string as beads.</p>
<p>And the protein domains are made up of amino acid residue.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So this is the basic,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying the protein domain</p>
<p>is the basic building block of the function</p>
<p>that we think about proteins doing.</p>
<p>So of course you can always talk</p>
<p>about different building blocks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a point where there is,</p>
<p>at the point of the hierarchy</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the most, the cleanest element block</p>
<p>based on which you can put them together</p>
<p>in different kinds of ways to form complex function.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying protein domains,</p>
<p>why is that not talked about as often in popular culture?</p>
<p>Well, there are several perspectives on this.</p>
<p>And one of course is the historical perspective, right?</p>
<p>So historically scientists have been able</p>
<p>to structurally resolved</p>
<p>to obtain the 3D coordinates of a protein</p>
<p>for smaller proteins.</p>
<p>And smaller proteins tend to be a single domain protein.</p>
<p>So we have a protein equal to a protein domain.</p>
<p>And so because of that,</p>
<p>the initial suspicion was that the proteins are,</p>
<p>they have globular shapes</p>
<p>and the more of smaller proteins you obtain structurally,</p>
<p>the more you became convinced that that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And only later when we started having</p>
<p>alternative approaches.</p>
<p>So the traditional ones are X ray crystallography</p>
<p>and NMR spectroscopy.</p>
<p>So this is sort of the two main techniques</p>
<p>that give us the 3D coordinates.</p>
<p>But nowadays there&rsquo;s huge breakthrough</p>
<p>in cryo electron microscopy.</p>
<p>So the more advanced methods that allow us</p>
<p>to get into the 3D shapes of much larger molecules,</p>
<p>molecular complexes,</p>
<p>just to give you one of the common examples</p>
<p>for this year, right?</p>
<p>So the first experimental structure</p>
<p>of a SARS COVID 2 protein</p>
<p>was the cryo EM structure of the S protein.</p>
<p>So the spike protein.</p>
<p>And so it was solved very quickly.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is the advancement</p>
<p>of this technology is pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>How many domains does the, is it more than one domain?</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I mean, so it&rsquo;s a very complex structure.</p>
<p>And we, you know, on top of the complexity</p>
<p>of a single protein, right?</p>
<p>So this structure is actually is a complex, is a trimer.</p>
<p>So it needs to form a trimer in order to function properly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a complex?</p>
<p>So a complex is a glomeration of multiple proteins.</p>
<p>And so we can have the same protein copied in multiple,</p>
<p>you know, made up in multiple copies</p>
<p>and forming something that we called a homo oligomer.</p>
<p>Homo means the same, right?</p>
<p>So in this case, so the spike protein is the,</p>
<p>is an example of a homo tetram, homo trimer, sorry.</p>
<p>So you need three copies of it?</p>
<p>Three copies.</p>
<p>In order to.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We have these three chains,</p>
<p>the three molecular chains coupled together</p>
<p>and performing the function.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, when you look at this protein from the top,</p>
<p>you see a perfect triangle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but other, you know,</p>
<p>so other complexes are made up of, you know,</p>
<p>different proteins.</p>
<p>Some of them are completely different.</p>
<p>Some of them are similar.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin molecule, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a protein complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of four basic subunits.</p>
<p>Two of them are identical to each other.</p>
<p>Two other identical to each other,</p>
<p>but they are also similar to each other,</p>
<p>which sort of gives us some ideas about the evolution</p>
<p>of this, you know, of this molecule.</p>
<p>And perhaps, so one of the hypothesis is that, you know,</p>
<p>in the past, it was just a homo tetramer, right?</p>
<p>So four identical copies,</p>
<p>and then it became, you know, sort of modified,</p>
<p>it became mutated over the time</p>
<p>and became more specialized.</p>
<p>Can we linger on the spike protein for a little bit?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting</p>
<p>or like beautiful you find about it?</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredibly challenging protein.</p>
<p>And so we, as a part of our sort of research</p>
<p>to understand the structural basis of this virus,</p>
<p>to sort of decode, structurally decode,</p>
<p>every single protein in its proteome,</p>
<p>which, you know, we&rsquo;ve been working on this spike protein.</p>
<p>And one of the main challenges was that the cryoEM data</p>
<p>allows us to reconstruct or to obtain the 3D coordinates</p>
<p>of roughly two thirds of the protein.</p>
<p>The rest of the one third of this protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part that is buried into the membrane of the virus</p>
<p>and of the viral envelope.</p>
<p>And it also has a lot of unstable structures around it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s chemically interacting somehow</p>
<p>with whatever the hex is connecting to.</p>
<p>Yeah, so people are still trying to understand.</p>
<p>So the nature of, and the role of this one third,</p>
<p>because the top part, you know, the primary function</p>
<p>is to get attached to the ACE2 receptor, human receptor.</p>
<p>There is also beautiful mechanics</p>
<p>of how this thing happens, right?</p>
<p>So because there are three different copies of this chains,</p>
<p>you know, there are three different domains, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about domains.</p>
<p>So this is the receptor binding domains, RBDs,</p>
<p>that gets untangled and get ready to get attached</p>
<p>to the receptor.</p>
<p>And now they are not necessarily going in a sync mode.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asynchronous.</p>
<p>So yes, and this is where another level of complexity</p>
<p>comes into play because right now what we see is,</p>
<p>we typically see just one of the arms going out</p>
<p>and getting ready to be attached to the ACE2 receptors.</p>
<p>However, there was a recent mutation</p>
<p>that people studied in that spike protein.</p>
<p>And very recently, a group from UMass Medical School</p>
<p>will happen to collaborate with groups.</p>
<p>So this is a group of Jeremy Lubin</p>
<p>and a number of other faculty.</p>
<p>They actually solve the mutated structure of the spike.</p>
<p>And they showed that actually, because of these mutations,</p>
<p>you have more than one arms opening up.</p>
<p>And so now, so the frequency of two arms going up</p>
<p>increase quite drastically.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Does that change the dynamics somehow?</p>
<p>It potentially can change the dynamics</p>
<p>because now you have two possible opportunities</p>
<p>to get attached to the ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complex molecular process, mechanistic process.</p>
<p>But the first step of this process is the attachment</p>
<p>of this spike protein, of the spike trimer</p>
<p>to the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>So this is a molecule that sits</p>
<p>on the surface of the human cell.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s essentially what initiates,</p>
<p>what triggers the whole process of encapsulation.</p>
<p>If this was dating, this would be the first date.</p>
<p>So this is the&hellip;</p>
<p>In a way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So is it possible to have the spike protein</p>
<p>just like floating about on its own?</p>
<p>Or does it need that interactability with the membrane?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it needs to be attached,</p>
<p>at least as far as I know.</p>
<p>But when you get this thing attached on the surface,</p>
<p>there is also a lot of dynamics</p>
<p>on how it sits on the surface.</p>
<p>So for example, there was a recent work in,</p>
<p>again, where people use the cryolectron microscopy</p>
<p>to get the first glimpse of the overall structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very low res, but you still get</p>
<p>some interesting details about the surface,</p>
<p>about what is happening inside,</p>
<p>because we have literally no clue until recent work</p>
<p>about how the capsid is organized.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a capsid?</p>
<p>So a capsid is essentially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the inner core of the viral particle</p>
<p>where there is the RNA of the virus,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s protected by another protein, N protein,</p>
<p>that essentially acts as a shield.</p>
<p>But now we are learning more and more,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s not just this shield,</p>
<p>it potentially is used for the stability</p>
<p>of the outer shell of the virus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty complicated.</p>
<p>And I mean, understanding all of this is really useful</p>
<p>for trying to figure out like developing a vaccine</p>
<p>or some kind of drug to attack,</p>
<p>any aspects of this, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, there are many different implications to that.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>the virus itself, right?</p>
<p>So in order to understand how it acts,</p>
<p>what is the overall mechanistic process</p>
<p>of this virus replication,</p>
<p>of this virus proliferation to the cell, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one aspect.</p>
<p>The other aspect is designing new treatments.</p>
<p>So one of the possible treatments</p>
<p>is designing nanoparticles.</p>
<p>And so some nanoparticles that will resemble the viral shape</p>
<p>that would have the spike integrated,</p>
<p>and essentially would act as a competitor to the real virus</p>
<p>by blocking the ACE2 receptors,</p>
<p>and thus preventing the real virus entering the cell.</p>
<p>Now, there are also, you know,</p>
<p>there is a very interesting direction</p>
<p>in looking at the membrane,</p>
<p>at the envelope portion of the protein</p>
<p>and attacking its M protein.</p>
<p>So there are, you know, to give you a, you know,</p>
<p>sort of a brief overview,</p>
<p>there are four structural proteins.</p>
<p>These are the proteins that made up</p>
<p>a structure of the virus.</p>
<p>So SPIKE, S protein that acts as a trimer,</p>
<p>so it needs three copies.</p>
<p>E, envelope protein that acts as a pantomime,</p>
<p>so it needs five copies to act properly.</p>
<p>M is a membrane protein, it forms dimers,</p>
<p>and actually it forms beautiful lattice.</p>
<p>And this is something that we&rsquo;ve been studying</p>
<p>and we are seeing it in simulations.</p>
<p>It actually forms a very nice grid</p>
<p>or, you know, threads, you know,</p>
<p>of different dimers attached next to each other.</p>
<p>Just a bunch of copies of each other,</p>
<p>and they naturally, when you have a bunch of copies</p>
<p>of each other, they form an interesting lattice.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you think about this, right?</p>
<p>So this complex, you know, the viral shape</p>
<p>needs to be organized somehow, self organized somehow, right?</p>
<p>So it, you know, if it was a completely random process,</p>
<p>you know, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the envelope shell</p>
<p>of the ellipsoid shape, you know,</p>
<p>you would have something, you know,</p>
<p>pretty random, right, shape.</p>
<p>So there is some, you know, regularity</p>
<p>in how this, you know, how this M dimers</p>
<p>get to attach to each other</p>
<p>in a very specific directed way.</p>
<p>Is that understood at all?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not understood.</p>
<p>We are now, we&rsquo;ve been working in the past six months</p>
<p>since, you know, we met, actually,</p>
<p>this is where we started working on trying to understand</p>
<p>the overall structure of the envelope</p>
<p>and the key components that made up this, you know,</p>
<p>structure.</p>
<p>Wait, does the envelope also have the lattice structure</p>
<p>or no?</p>
<p>So the envelope is essentially is the outer shell</p>
<p>of the viral particle.</p>
<p>The N, the nucleocapsid protein,</p>
<p>is something that is inside.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But get that, the N is likely to interact with M.</p>
<p>Does it go M and E?</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;s the E and the M?</p>
<p>So E, those different proteins,</p>
<p>they occur in different copies on the viral particle.</p>
<p>So E, this pentamer complex,</p>
<p>we only have two or three, maybe, per each particle, okay?</p>
<p>We have thousand or so of M dimers</p>
<p>that essentially made up,</p>
<p>that makes up the entire, you know, outer shell.</p>
<p>So most of the outer shell is the M.</p>
<p>M dimer.</p>
<p>And the M protein.</p>
<p>When you say particle, that&rsquo;s the virion,</p>
<p>the virus, the individual virus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a single, yes.</p>
<p>Single element of the virus, it&rsquo;s a single virus.</p>
<p>Single virus, right.</p>
<p>And we have about, you know, roughly 50 to 90 spike trimmers.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So when you, you know, when you show a&hellip;</p>
<p>Per virus particle.</p>
<p>Sorry, what did you say, 50 to 90?</p>
<p>50 to 90, right?</p>
<p>So this is how this thing is organized.</p>
<p>And so now, typically, right,</p>
<p>so you see these, the antibodies that target,</p>
<p>you know, spike protein,</p>
<p>certain parts of the spike protein,</p>
<p>but there could be some, also some treatments, right?</p>
<p>So these are, you know, these are small molecules</p>
<p>that bind strategic parts of these proteins,</p>
<p>disrupting its function.</p>
<p>So one of the promising directions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the newest directions,</p>
<p>is actually targeting the M dimer of the protein.</p>
<p>Targeting the proteins that make up this outer shell.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re able to destroy the outer shell,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially destroying the viral particle itself.</p>
<p>So preventing it from, you know, functioning at all.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you think is,</p>
<p>from a sort of cyber security perspective,</p>
<p>virus security perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best attack vector?</p>
<p>Is, or like, that&rsquo;s a promising attack vector?</p>
<p>I would say, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s still tons of research needs to be,</p>
<p>you know, to be done.</p>
<p>But yes, I think, you know, so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more attack surface, I guess.</p>
<p>More attack surface.</p>
<p>But, you know, from our analysis,</p>
<p>from other evolutionary analysis,</p>
<p>this protein is evolutionarily more stable</p>
<p>compared to the, say, to the spike protein.</p>
<p>Oh, and stable means a more static target?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so it doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t evolve from the evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>so drastically as, for example, the spike protein.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff in the news</p>
<p>about mutations of the virus in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I also saw in South Africa something.</p>
<p>Maybe that was yesterday.</p>
<p>You just kind of mentioned about stability and so on.</p>
<p>Which aspects of this are mutatable</p>
<p>and which aspects, if mutated, become more dangerous?</p>
<p>And maybe even zooming out,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts and knowledge and ideas</p>
<p>about the way it&rsquo;s mutated,</p>
<p>all the news that we&rsquo;ve been hearing?</p>
<p>Are you worried about it from a biological perspective?</p>
<p>Are you worried about it from a human perspective?</p>
<p>So, I mean, you know, mutations are sort of a general way</p>
<p>for these viruses to evolve, right?</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s essentially,</p>
<p>this is the way they evolve.</p>
<p>This is the way they were able to jump</p>
<p>from one species to another.</p>
<p>We also see some recent jumps.</p>
<p>There were some incidents of this virus jumping</p>
<p>from human to dogs.</p>
<p>So, you know, there is some danger in those jumps</p>
<p>because every time it jumps, it also mutates, right?</p>
<p>So, when it jumps to the species</p>
<p>and jumps back, right?</p>
<p>So, it acquires some mutations</p>
<p>that are sort of driven by the environment</p>
<p>of a new host, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different from the human environment.</p>
<p>And so, we don&rsquo;t know whether the mutations</p>
<p>that are acquired in the new species</p>
<p>are neutral with respect to the human host</p>
<p>or maybe, you know, maybe damaging.</p>
<p>Yeah, change is always scary, but so are you worried about,</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like because the spread is,</p>
<p>during winter now, seems to be exceptionally high</p>
<p>and especially with a vaccine just around the corner</p>
<p>already being actually deployed,</p>
<p>is there some worry that this puts evolutionary pressure,</p>
<p>selective pressure on the virus for it to mutate?</p>
<p>Is that a source of worry?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there is always this thought</p>
<p>in the scientist&rsquo;s mind, you know, what will happen, right?</p>
<p>So, I know there&rsquo;ve been discussions</p>
<p>about sort of the arms race between the ability</p>
<p>of the humanity to get vaccinated faster</p>
<p>than the virus, you know, essentially, you know,</p>
<p>it becomes, you know, resistant to the vaccine.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t worry that much simply because,</p>
<p>you know, there is not that much evidence to that.</p>
<p>To aggressive mutation around the vaccine.</p>
<p>Exactly, you know, obviously there are mutations</p>
<p>around the vaccine, so the reason we get vaccinated</p>
<p>every year against the seasonal mutations, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, I think it&rsquo;s important to study it.</p>
<p>No doubts, right?</p>
<p>So, I think one of the, you know, to me,</p>
<p>and again, I might be biased because, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been trying to do that as well,</p>
<p>so, but one of the critical directions</p>
<p>in understanding the virus is to understand its evolution</p>
<p>in order to sort of understand the mechanisms,</p>
<p>the key mechanisms that lead the virus to jump,</p>
<p>you know, the Nordic viruses to jump from species,</p>
<p>from species to another, that the mechanisms</p>
<p>that lead the virus to become resistant to vaccines,</p>
<p>also to treatments, right?</p>
<p>And hopefully that knowledge will enable us</p>
<p>to sort of forecast the evolutionary traces,</p>
<p>the future evolutionary traces of this virus.</p>
<p>I mean, what, from a biological perspective,</p>
<p>this might be a dumb question,</p>
<p>but is there parts of the virus that if souped up,</p>
<p>like through mutation, could make it more effective</p>
<p>at doing its job?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about this specific coronavirus</p>
<p>because we were talking about the different, like,</p>
<p>the membrane, the M protein, the E protein,</p>
<p>the N and the S, the spike, is there some?</p>
<p>And there are 20 or so more in addition to that.</p>
<p>But is that a dumb way to look at it?</p>
<p>Like, which of these, if mutated,</p>
<p>could have the greatest impact, potentially damaging impact,</p>
<p>on the effectiveness of the virus?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a very good question</p>
<p>because, and the short answer is, we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>But of course there is capacity of this virus</p>
<p>to become more efficient.</p>
<p>The reason for that is, you know,</p>
<p>so if you look at the virus, I mean, it&rsquo;s a machine, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a machine that does a lot of different functions,</p>
<p>and many of these functions are sort of nearly perfect,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>
<p>And those mutations can have the greatest impact</p>
<p>and make those functions more perfect.</p>
<p>For example, the attachment to ACE2 receptor, right,</p>
<p>of the spike, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, has this virus reached the efficiency</p>
<p>in which the attachment is carried out?</p>
<p>Or there are some mutations that still to be discovered,</p>
<p>right, that will make this attachment sort of stronger,</p>
<p>or, you know, something more, in a way more efficient</p>
<p>from the point of view of this virus functioning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the obvious example.</p>
<p>But if you look at each of these proteins,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s there for a reason,</p>
<p>it performs certain function.</p>
<p>And it could be that certain mutations will, you know,</p>
<p>enhance this function.</p>
<p>It could be that some mutations will make this function</p>
<p>much less efficient, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also the case.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, since we&rsquo;re talking about the evolutionary history</p>
<p>of a virus, let&rsquo;s zoom back out</p>
<p>and look at the evolution of proteins.</p>
<p>I glanced at this 2010 Nature paper</p>
<p>on the quote, ongoing expansion of the protein universe.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it kind of implies and talks about</p>
<p>that proteins started with a common ancestor,</p>
<p>which is, you know, kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about like,</p>
<p>even just like the first organic thing</p>
<p>that started life on Earth.</p>
<p>And from that, there&rsquo;s now, you know, what is it?</p>
<p>3.5 billion years later, there&rsquo;s now millions of proteins.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still evolving.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, in part,</p>
<p>one of the things that you&rsquo;re researching.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to you about the evolution</p>
<p>of proteins from this initial ancestor to today?</p>
<p>Is there something beautiful and insightful</p>
<p>about this long story?</p>
<p>So I think, you know, if I were to pick a single keyword</p>
<p>about protein evolution, I would pick modularity,</p>
<p>something that we talked about in the beginning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fact that the proteins are no longer</p>
<p>considered as, you know, as a sequence of letters.</p>
<p>There are hierarchical complexities</p>
<p>in the way these proteins are organized.</p>
<p>And these complexities are actually going</p>
<p>beyond the protein sequence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually going all the way back to the gene,</p>
<p>to the nucleotide sequence.</p>
<p>And so, you know, again, these protein domains,</p>
<p>they are not only functional building blocks,</p>
<p>they are also evolutionary building blocks.</p>
<p>And so what we see in the sort of,</p>
<p>in the later stages of evolution,</p>
<p>I mean, once this stable structurally</p>
<p>and functionally building blocks were discovered,</p>
<p>they essentially, they stay, those domains stay as such.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why if you start comparing different proteins,</p>
<p>you will see that many of them will have similar fragments.</p>
<p>And those fragments will correspond to something</p>
<p>that we call protein domain families.</p>
<p>And so they are still different</p>
<p>because you still have mutations and, you know,</p>
<p>the, you know, different mutations are attributed to,</p>
<p>to, you know, diversification of the function</p>
<p>of this, you know, protein domains.</p>
<p>However, you don&rsquo;t, you very rarely see, you know,</p>
<p>the evolutionary events that would split</p>
<p>this domain into fragments because,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, once you have the domain split,</p>
<p>you actually, you, you know,</p>
<p>you can completely cancel out its function</p>
<p>or at the very least you can reduce it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not, you know, efficient from the point of view</p>
<p>of the, you know, of the cell functioning.</p>
<p>So, so the, the, the protein domain level</p>
<p>is a very important one.</p>
<p>Now, on top of that, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at the proteins, right,</p>
<p>so you have this structural units</p>
<p>and they carry out the function,</p>
<p>but then much less is known about things</p>
<p>that connect this protein domains,</p>
<p>something that we call linkers.</p>
<p>And those linkers are completely flexible, you know,</p>
<p>parts of the protein that nevertheless</p>
<p>carry out a lot of function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like little tails, little heads.</p>
<p>So, so, so we do have tails.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re called termini, C and N termini.</p>
<p>So these are things right on the, on, on, on one</p>
<p>and another ends of the protein sequence.</p>
<p>So they are also very important.</p>
<p>So they, they attributed to very specific interactions</p>
<p>between the proteins.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re referring to the links between domains.</p>
<p>That connect the domains.</p>
<p>And, you know, apart from the, just the,</p>
<p>the simple perspective, if you have, you know,</p>
<p>a very short domain, you have, sorry, a very short linker,</p>
<p>you have two domains next to each other.</p>
<p>They are forced to be next to each other.</p>
<p>If you have a very long one,</p>
<p>you have the domains that are extremely flexible</p>
<p>and they carry out a lot of sort of</p>
<p>spatial reorganization, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But on top of that, right, just this linker itself,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so flexible, it actually can adapt</p>
<p>to a lot of different shapes.</p>
<p>And therefore it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a very good interactor</p>
<p>when it comes to interaction between this protein</p>
<p>and other protein, right?</p>
<p>So these things also evolve, you know,</p>
<p>and they in a way have different sort of laws of</p>
<p>the driving laws that underlie the evolution</p>
<p>because they no longer need to,</p>
<p>to preserve certain structure, right?</p>
<p>Unlike protein domains.</p>
<p>And so on top of that,</p>
<p>you have something that is even less studied.</p>
<p>And this is something that attribute to,</p>
<p>to the concept of alternative splicing.</p>
<p>So alternative splicing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a very cool concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve been fascinated about for,</p>
<p>you know, over a decade in my lab</p>
<p>and trying to do research with that.</p>
<p>But so, you know, so typically, you know,</p>
<p>a simplistic perspective is that one gene</p>
<p>is equal one protein product, right?</p>
<p>So you have a gene, you know,</p>
<p>you transcribe it and translate it</p>
<p>and it becomes a protein.</p>
<p>In reality, when we talk about eukaryotes,</p>
<p>especially sort of more recent eukaryotes</p>
<p>that are very complex,</p>
<p>the gene is no longer equal to one protein.</p>
<p>It actually can produce multiple functionally,</p>
<p>you know, active protein products.</p>
<p>And each of them is, you know,</p>
<p>is called an alternatively spliced product.</p>
<p>The reason it happens is that if you look at the gene,</p>
<p>it actually has, it has also blocks.</p>
<p>And the blocks, some of which,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s essentially, it goes like this.</p>
<p>So we have a block that will later be translated.</p>
<p>We call it exon.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll have a block that is not translated, cut out.</p>
<p>We call it intron.</p>
<p>So we have exon, intron, exon, intron,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>So sometimes you can have, you know,</p>
<p>dozens of these exons and introns.</p>
<p>So what happens is during the process</p>
<p>when the gene is converted to RNA,</p>
<p>we have things that are cut out,</p>
<p>the introns that are cut out,</p>
<p>and exons that now get assembled together.</p>
<p>And sometimes we will throw out some of the exons</p>
<p>and the remaining protein product will become</p>
<p>still be the same.</p>
<p>Different.</p>
<p>Oh, different.</p>
<p>So now you have fragments of the protein</p>
<p>that no longer there.</p>
<p>They were cut out with the introns.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will essentially take one exon</p>
<p>and replace it with another one, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some flexibility in this process.</p>
<p>So that creates a whole new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Cause now.</p>
<p>Is this random though?</p>
<p>Is it random?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not random.</p>
<p>We, and this is where I think now the appearance</p>
<p>of this modern single cell</p>
<p>and before that tissue level sequencing,</p>
<p>next generation sequencing techniques such as RNA seed</p>
<p>allows us to see that these are the events</p>
<p>that often happen in response.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic event that happens in response</p>
<p>to disease or in response</p>
<p>to certain developmental stage of a cell.</p>
<p>And this is an incredibly complex layer</p>
<p>that also undergoes, I mean,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s at the gene level, right?</p>
<p>So it undergoes certain evolution, right?</p>
<p>And now we have this interplay</p>
<p>between what is happening in the protein world</p>
<p>and what is happening in the gene and RNA world.</p>
<p>And for example, it&rsquo;s often that we see</p>
<p>that the boundaries of this exons coincide</p>
<p>with the boundaries of the protein domains, right?</p>
<p>So there is this close interplay to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always, I mean, otherwise it would be too simple,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But we do see the connection</p>
<p>between those sort of machineries.</p>
<p>And obviously the evolution will pick up this complexity</p>
<p>and, you know.</p>
<p>Select for whatever is successful,</p>
<p>whatever is interesting function.</p>
<p>We see that complexity in play</p>
<p>and makes this question more complex, but more exciting.</p>
<p>Small detour, I don&rsquo;t know if you think about this</p>
<p>into the world of computer science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Douglas Hostetter, I think,</p>
<p>came up with the name of Quine,</p>
<p>which are, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with these things, but it&rsquo;s computer programs</p>
<p>that have, I guess, exon and intron,</p>
<p>and they copy, the whole purpose of the program</p>
<p>is to copy itself.</p>
<p>So it prints copies of itself,</p>
<p>but can also carry information inside of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very kind of crude, fun exercise of,</p>
<p>can we sort of replicate these ideas from cells?</p>
<p>Can we have a computer program that when you run it,</p>
<p>just print itself, the entirety of itself,</p>
<p>and does it in different programming languages and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around and writing them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of fun little exercise.</p>
<p>You know, when I was a kid, so you know,</p>
<p>it was essentially one of the sort of main stages</p>
<p>in informatics Olympiads that you have to reach</p>
<p>in order to be any so good,</p>
<p>is you should be able to write a program</p>
<p>that replicates itself.</p>
<p>And so the task then becomes even sort of more complicated.</p>
<p>So what is the shortest program?</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s a function of a programming language,</p>
<p>but yeah, I remember a long, long, long time ago</p>
<p>when we tried to make it short and short</p>
<p>and find the shortcut.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually on a stack exchange, there&rsquo;s a entire site</p>
<p>called CodeGolf, I think,</p>
<p>where the entirety is just the competition.</p>
<p>People just come up with whatever task, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like write code that reports the weather today.</p>
<p>And the competition is about whatever programming language,</p>
<p>what is the shortest program?</p>
<p>And it makes you actually, people should check it out</p>
<p>because it makes you realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some weird programming languages out there.</p>
<p>But just to dig on that a little deeper,</p>
<p>do you think, in computer science,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t often think about programs,</p>
<p>just like the machine learning world now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still kind of basic programs.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s humans that replicate themselves, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these mutations and so on.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever have a world</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s programs that kind of</p>
<p>have an evolutionary process?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about evolutionary algorithms,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking about programs that kind of</p>
<p>mate with each other and evolve</p>
<p>and like on their own replicate themselves.</p>
<p>So this is kind of the idea here is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you can have a runaway thing.</p>
<p>So we think about machine learning as a system</p>
<p>that gets smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>At least the machine learning systems of today are like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a program that you can like turn off,</p>
<p>as opposed to throwing a bunch of little programs out there</p>
<p>and letting them like multiply and mate</p>
<p>and evolve and replicate.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about that kind of world,</p>
<p>when we jump from the biological systems</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking at to artificial ones?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like you take the sort of the area</p>
<p>of intelligent agents, right?</p>
<p>Which are essentially the independent sort of codes</p>
<p>that run and interact and exchange the information, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see why not.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be sort of a natural evolution</p>
<p>in this area of computer science.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting possibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying too,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a really powerful tool.</p>
<p>Like to have like agents that, you know,</p>
<p>we have social networks with millions of people</p>
<p>and they interact.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to inject into that,</p>
<p>was already injected into that bots, right?</p>
<p>But those bots are pretty dumb.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re probably pretty dumb algorithms.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting to think</p>
<p>that there might be bots that evolve together with humans.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the sea of humans and robots</p>
<p>that are operating first in the digital space.</p>
<p>And then you can also think, I love the idea.</p>
<p>Some people worked, I think at Harvard, at Penn,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s robotics labs that, you know,</p>
<p>take as a fundamental task to build a robot</p>
<p>that given extra resources can build another copy of itself,</p>
<p>like in the physical space,</p>
<p>which is super difficult to do, but super interesting.</p>
<p>I remember there&rsquo;s like research on robots</p>
<p>that can build a bridge.</p>
<p>So they make a copy of themselves</p>
<p>and they connect themselves</p>
<p>and the sort of like self building bridge</p>
<p>based on building blocks.</p>
<p>You can imagine like a building that self assembles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically self assembling structures</p>
<p>from robotic parts.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to, within that robot,</p>
<p>add the ability to mutate</p>
<p>and do all the interesting like little things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to in evolution</p>
<p>to go from a single origin protein building block</p>
<p>to like this weird complex.</p>
<p>And if you think about this, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>the bits and pieces are there, you know.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the evolution algorithm, right?</p>
<p>You know, so this is sort of,</p>
<p>and maybe sort of the goal is in a way different, right?</p>
<p>So the goal is to, you know, to essentially,</p>
<p>to optimize your search, right?</p>
<p>So, but sort of the ideas are there.</p>
<p>So people recognize that, you know,</p>
<p>that the recombination events lead to global changes</p>
<p>in the search trajectories, the mutations event</p>
<p>is a more refined, you know, step in the search.</p>
<p>Then you have, you know, other sort of</p>
<p>nature inspired algorithm, right?</p>
<p>So one of the reasons that, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the funnest one</p>
<p>is the slime based algorithm, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think the first was introduced</p>
<p>by the Japanese group,</p>
<p>where it was able to solve some pre complex problems.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, and then I think there are still a lot of things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve yet to, you know, borrow from the nature, right?</p>
<p>So there are a lot of sort of ideas</p>
<p>that nature, you know, gets to offer us that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to us to grab it and to, you know,</p>
<p>get the best use of it.</p>
<p>Including neural networks, you know, we have a very crude</p>
<p>inspiration from nature on neural networks.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other inspirations to be discovered</p>
<p>in the brain or other aspects of the various systems,</p>
<p>even like the immune system, the way it interplays.</p>
<p>I recently started to understand that the,</p>
<p>like the immune system has something to do</p>
<p>with the way the brain operates.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s multiple things going on in there,</p>
<p>which all of which are not modeled</p>
<p>in artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>And maybe if you throw a little bit of that biological spice</p>
<p>in there, you&rsquo;ll come up with something, something cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with the Drake equation</p>
<p>that estimate, I just did a video on it yesterday</p>
<p>because I wanted to give my own estimate of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an equation that combines a bunch of factors</p>
<p>to estimate how many alien civilizations are in the galaxy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about it, yes.</p>
<p>So one of the interesting parameters, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how many stars are born every year,</p>
<p>how many planets are on average per star for this,</p>
<p>how many habitable planets are there.</p>
<p>And then the one that starts being really interesting</p>
<p>is the probability that life emerges on a habitable planet.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t know if you think about,</p>
<p>you certainly think a lot about evolution,</p>
<p>but do you think about the thing</p>
<p>which evolution doesn&rsquo;t describe,</p>
<p>which is like the beginning of evolution, the origin of life.</p>
<p>I think I put the probability of life developing</p>
<p>in a habitable planet at 1%.</p>
<p>This is very scientifically rigorous.</p>
<p>Okay, well, first at a high level for the Drake equation,</p>
<p>what would you put that percent at on earth?</p>
<p>And in general, do you have something,</p>
<p>do you have thoughts about how life might&rsquo;ve started,</p>
<p>you know, like the proteins being the first kind of,</p>
<p>one of the early jumping points?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think back in 2018,</p>
<p>there was a very exciting paper published in Nature</p>
<p>where they found one of the simplest amino acids,</p>
<p>glycine, in a comet dust.</p>
<p>So this is, and I apologize if I don&rsquo;t pronounce,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Russian named comet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think Chugryumov Gerasimenko.</p>
<p>This is the comet where, and there was this mission</p>
<p>to get close to this comet and get the stardust</p>
<p>from its tail.</p>
<p>And when scientists analyzed it,</p>
<p>they actually found traces of, you know, of glycine,</p>
<p>which, you know, makes up, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the basic, one of the 20 basic amino acids</p>
<p>that makes up proteins, right?</p>
<p>So that was kind of very exciting, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, the question is very interesting, right?</p>
<p>So what, you know, if there is some alien life,</p>
<p>is it gonna be made of proteins, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe RNAs, right?</p>
<p>So we see that, you know, the RNA viruses are certainly,</p>
<p>you know, very well established sort of, you know,</p>
<p>group of molecular machines, right?</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>What probability would you put?</p>
<p>Like, how hard is this job?</p>
<p>Like, how unlikely just on Earth do you think</p>
<p>this whole thing is that we got going?</p>
<p>Like, are we really lucky or is it inevitable?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s your sense when you sit back</p>
<p>and think about life on Earth?</p>
<p>Is it higher or lower than 1%?</p>
<p>Well, because 1% is pretty low, but it still is like,</p>
<p>damn, that&rsquo;s a pretty good chance.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a pretty good chance.</p>
<p>I mean, I would, personally, but again, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, probably not the best person</p>
<p>to do such estimations, but I would, you know,</p>
<p>intuitively, I would probably put it lower.</p>
<p>But still, I mean, you know, given.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really lucky here on Earth.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Or the conditions are really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, I think that there was,</p>
<p>everything was right in a way, right?</p>
<p>So we still, it&rsquo;s not, the conditions were not like ideal</p>
<p>if you try to look at, you know, what was, you know,</p>
<p>several billions years ago when the life emerged.</p>
<p>So there is something called the Rare Earth Hypothesis</p>
<p>that, you know, in counter to the Drake Equation says</p>
<p>that the, you know, the conditions of Earth,</p>
<p>if you actually were to describe Earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite a special place.</p>
<p>So special it might be unique in our galaxy</p>
<p>and potentially, you know, close to unique</p>
<p>in the entire universe.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very difficult to reconstruct</p>
<p>those same conditions.</p>
<p>And what the Rare Earth Hypothesis argues</p>
<p>is all those different conditions are essential for life.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of the counter, you know,</p>
<p>like all the things we, you know,</p>
<p>thinking that Earth is pretty average.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;m trying to remember</p>
<p>to go through all of them, but just the fact</p>
<p>that it is shielded from a lot of asteroids,</p>
<p>the, obviously the distance to the sun,</p>
<p>but also the fact that it&rsquo;s like a perfect balance</p>
<p>between the amount of water and land</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of different factors</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t remember, there&rsquo;s a long list.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating to think about if in order</p>
<p>for something like proteins and then DNA and RNA</p>
<p>to emerge, you need, and basic living organisms,</p>
<p>you need to be very close to an Earth like planet,</p>
<p>which will be sad or exciting, I don&rsquo;t know which.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I, you know, in a way I put a parallel</p>
<p>between, you know, between our own research.</p>
<p>And I mean, from the intuitive perspective,</p>
<p>you know, you have those two extremes</p>
<p>and the reality is never very rarely falls</p>
<p>into the extremes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the optimus always reached somewhere in between.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s what I tend to think.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, we&rsquo;re probably somewhere in between.</p>
<p>So they were not unique, unique, but again,</p>
<p>the chances are, you know, reasonably small.</p>
<p>The problem is we don&rsquo;t know the other extreme</p>
<p>is like, I tend to think that we don&rsquo;t actually understand</p>
<p>the basic mechanisms of like what this is all originated</p>
<p>from, like, it seems like we think of life</p>
<p>as this distinct thing, maybe intelligence</p>
<p>is a distinct thing, maybe the physics that,</p>
<p>from which planets and suns are born is a distinct thing.</p>
<p>But that could be a very, it&rsquo;s like the Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>thing, it&rsquo;s like the, from simple rules emerges</p>
<p>greater and greater complexity.</p>
<p>So, you know, I tend to believe that just life finds a way.</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t know the extreme of how common life is</p>
<p>because it could be life is like everywhere.</p>
<p>Like, so everywhere that it&rsquo;s almost like laughable,</p>
<p>like that we&rsquo;re such idiots to think who are you?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like ridiculous to even like think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ants thinking that their little colony</p>
<p>is the unique thing and everything else doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s also very possible that that&rsquo;s the extreme</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just not able to maybe comprehend</p>
<p>the nature of that life.</p>
<p>Just to stick on alien life for just a brief moment more,</p>
<p>there is some signs of life on Venus in gaseous form.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hope for life on Mars, probably extinct.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about intelligent life.</p>
<p>Although that has been in the news recently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about basic like, you know, bacteria.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then also, I guess, there&rsquo;s a couple moons.</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>Yeah, Europa, which is Jupiter&rsquo;s moon.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Are you, is that exciting or is it terrifying to you</p>
<p>that we might find life?</p>
<p>Do you hope we find life?</p>
<p>I certainly do hope that we find life.</p>
<p>I mean, it was very exciting to hear about this news</p>
<p>about the possible life on Venus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to have hard evidence of something with,</p>
<p>which is what the hope is for Mars and Europa.</p>
<p>But do you think those organisms</p>
<p>will be similar biologically</p>
<p>or would they even be sort of carbon based</p>
<p>if we do find them?</p>
<p>I would say they would be carbon based.</p>
<p>How similar, it&rsquo;s a big question, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the moment we discover things outside Earth, right?</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a tiny little single cell.</p>
<p>I mean, there is so much.</p>
<p>Just imagine that, that would be so.</p>
<p>I think that that would be another turning point</p>
<p>for the science, you know?</p>
<p>Especially if it&rsquo;s different in some very new way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Because that says, that&rsquo;s a definitive statement,</p>
<p>not a definitive, but a pretty strong statement</p>
<p>that life is everywhere in the universe.</p>
<p>To me at least, that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>You brought up Joshua Lederberg in an offline conversation.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about Alpha Fold</p>
<p>and this might be an interesting way</p>
<p>to enter that conversation because,</p>
<p>so he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine</p>
<p>for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes.</p>
<p>But he also did a ton of other stuff,</p>
<p>like we mentioned, helping NASA find life on Mars</p>
<p>and the&hellip;</p>
<p>Dendro. Dendro.</p>
<p>The chemical expert system.</p>
<p>Expert systems, remember those?</p>
<p>What do you find interesting about this guy</p>
<p>and his ideas about artificial intelligence in general?</p>
<p>So I have a kind of personal story to share.</p>
<p>So I started my PhD in Canada back in 2000.</p>
<p>And so essentially my PhD was,</p>
<p>so we were developing sort of a new language</p>
<p>for symbolic machine learning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s different from the feature based machine learning.</p>
<p>And one of the sort of cleanest applications</p>
<p>of this approach, of this formalism</p>
<p>was to cheminformatics and computer aided drug design.</p>
<p>So essentially we were, as a part of my research,</p>
<p>I developed a system that essentially looked</p>
<p>at chemical compounds of say the same therapeutic category,</p>
<p>you know, male hormones, right?</p>
<p>And try to figure out the structural fragments</p>
<p>that are the structural building blocks</p>
<p>that are important that define this class</p>
<p>versus structural building blocks</p>
<p>that are there just because, you know,</p>
<p>to complete the structure.</p>
<p>But they are not essentially the ones</p>
<p>that make up the chemical, the key chemical properties</p>
<p>of this therapeutic category.</p>
<p>And, you know, for me, it was something new.</p>
<p>I was trained as an applied mathematicians, you know,</p>
<p>as with some machine learning background,</p>
<p>but, you know, computer aided drug design</p>
<p>was a completely new territory.</p>
<p>So because of that, I often find myself</p>
<p>asking lots of questions on one of these</p>
<p>sort of central forums.</p>
<p>Back then, there were no Facebooks or stuff like that.</p>
<p>There was a forum, you know, it&rsquo;s a forum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially, it&rsquo;s like a bulletin board.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you essentially, you have a bunch of people</p>
<p>and you post a question and you get, you know,</p>
<p>an answer from, you know, different people.</p>
<p>And back then, just like one of the most popular forums</p>
<p>was CCL, I think Computational Chemistry Library,</p>
<p>not library, but something like that,</p>
<p>but CCL, that was the forum.</p>
<p>And there, I, you know, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Asked a lot of dumb questions.</p>
<p>Yes, I asked questions.</p>
<p>Also shared some, you know, some information</p>
<p>about how formal it is and how we do</p>
<p>and whether whatever we do makes sense.</p>
<p>And so, you know, and I remember that one of these posts,</p>
<p>I mean, I still remember, you know,</p>
<p>I would call it desperately looking</p>
<p>for a chemist advice, something like that, right?</p>
<p>And so I post my question, I explained, you know,</p>
<p>how formalism is, what it does</p>
<p>and what kind of applications I&rsquo;m planning to do.</p>
<p>And, you know, and it was, you know,</p>
<p>in the middle of the night and I went back to bed.</p>
<p>And next morning, have a phone call from my advisor</p>
<p>who also looked at this forum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you won&rsquo;t believe who replied to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, who?</p>
<p>And he said, well, you know, there is a message</p>
<p>to you from Joshua Lederberg.</p>
<p>And my reaction was like, who is Joshua Lederberg?</p>
<p>Your advisor hung up. So, and essentially, you know,</p>
<p>Joshua wrote me that we had conceptually similar ideas</p>
<p>in the dendrial project.</p>
<p>You may wanna look it up.</p>
<p>And we should also, sorry, and it&rsquo;s a side comment,</p>
<p>say that even though he won the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>at a really young age, in 58, but so he was,</p>
<p>I think he was what, 33.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>So anyway, so that&rsquo;s, so hence in the 90s,</p>
<p>responding to young whippersnappers on the CCL forum.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so back then he was already very senior.</p>
<p>I mean, he unfortunately passed away back in 2008,</p>
<p>but, you know, back in 2001, he was, I mean,</p>
<p>he was a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University.</p>
<p>And, you know, that was actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I decided to join, you know,</p>
<p>as a postdoc, the group of Andre Salle,</p>
<p>who was at Rockefeller University,</p>
<p>with the hope that, you know, that I could actually,</p>
<p>you know, have a chance to meet Joshua in person.</p>
<p>And I met him very briefly, right?</p>
<p>Just because he was walking, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bridge that connects the,</p>
<p>sort of the research campus with the,</p>
<p>with the sort of skyscraper that Rockefeller owns,</p>
<p>the where, you know, postdocs and faculty</p>
<p>and graduate students live.</p>
<p>And so I met him, you know,</p>
<p>and had a very short conversation, you know.</p>
<p>But so I started, you know, reading about Dendral</p>
<p>and I was amazed, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about 1960, right?</p>
<p>The ideas were so profound.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the fun about the ideas of it?</p>
<p>The reason to make this is even crazier.</p>
<p>So, Lederberg wanted to make a system</p>
<p>that would help him study the extraterrestrial molecules,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So, the idea was that, you know,</p>
<p>the way you study the extraterrestrial molecules</p>
<p>is you do the mass spec analysis, right?</p>
<p>And so the mass spec gives you sort of bits,</p>
<p>numbers about essentially gives you the ideas</p>
<p>about the possible fragments or, you know,</p>
<p>atoms, you know, and maybe a little fragments,</p>
<p>pieces of this molecule that make up the molecule, right?</p>
<p>So now you need to sort of,</p>
<p>to decompose this information</p>
<p>and to figure out what was the hole</p>
<p>before it became fragments, bits and pieces, right?</p>
<p>So, in order to make this, you know,</p>
<p>to have this tool, the idea of Lederberg</p>
<p>was to connect chemistry, computer science,</p>
<p>and to design this so called expert system</p>
<p>that looks, that takes into account,</p>
<p>that takes as an input the mass spec data,</p>
<p>the possible database of possible molecules</p>
<p>and essentially try to sort of induce the molecule</p>
<p>that would correspond to this spectra</p>
<p>or, you know, essentially what this project ended up being</p>
<p>was that, you know, it would provide a list of candidates</p>
<p>that then a chemist would look at and make final decision.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But the original idea, I suppose,</p>
<p>is to solve the entirety of this problem automatically.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So he, you know, so he,</p>
<p>back then he approached. 60s.</p>
<p>Yes, believe that, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, it still blows my mind, you know, that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, and this was essentially the origin</p>
<p>of the modern bioinformatics, cheminformatics,</p>
<p>you know, back in 60s.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know, every time you deal with projects</p>
<p>like this, with the, you know, research like this,</p>
<p>you just, you know, so the power of the, you know,</p>
<p>intelligence of this people is just, you know, overwhelming.</p>
<p>Do you think about expert systems, is there,</p>
<p>and why they kind of didn&rsquo;t become successful,</p>
<p>especially in the space of bioinformatics,</p>
<p>where it does seem like there is a lot of expertise</p>
<p>in humans, and, you know, it&rsquo;s possible to see</p>
<p>that a system like this could be made very useful.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And be built up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a great question,</p>
<p>and this is something, so, you know, so, you know,</p>
<p>at my university, I teach artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and, you know, we start, my first two lectures</p>
<p>are on the history of AI.</p>
<p>And there we, you know, we try to, you know,</p>
<p>go through the main stages of AI.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the question of why expert systems failed</p>
<p>or became obsolete, it&rsquo;s actually a very interesting one.</p>
<p>And there are, you know, if you try to read the, you know,</p>
<p>the historical perspectives,</p>
<p>there are actually two lines of thoughts.</p>
<p>One is that they were essentially</p>
<p>not up to the expectations.</p>
<p>And so therefore they were replaced, you know,</p>
<p>by other things, right?</p>
<p>The other one was that completely opposite one,</p>
<p>that they were too good.</p>
<p>And as a result, they essentially became</p>
<p>sort of a household name,</p>
<p>and then essentially they got transformed.</p>
<p>I mean, in both cases, sort of the outcome was the same.</p>
<p>They evolved into something, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I, you know, if I look at this, right?</p>
<p>So the modern machine learning, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s echoes in the modern machine learning.</p>
<p>I think so, I think so, because, you know,</p>
<p>if you think about this, you know, and how we design,</p>
<p>you know, the most successful algorithms,</p>
<p>including AlphaFold, right?</p>
<p>You built in the knowledge about the domain</p>
<p>that you study, right?</p>
<p>So you built in your expertise.</p>
<p>So speaking of AlphaFold,</p>
<p>so DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaFold 2 recently was announced</p>
<p>to have, quote unquote, solved protein folding.</p>
<p>But how exciting is this to you?</p>
<p>It seems to be one of the,</p>
<p>one of the exciting things that have happened in 2020.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible accomplishment from the looks of it.</p>
<p>What part of it is amazing to you?</p>
<p>What part would you say is over hype</p>
<p>or maybe misunderstood?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a very exciting achievement.</p>
<p>To give you a little bit of perspective, right?</p>
<p>So in bioinformatics, we have several competitions.</p>
<p>And so the way, you know, you often hear</p>
<p>how those competitions have been explained</p>
<p>to sort of to non bioinformaticians is that, you know,</p>
<p>they call it bioinformatics Olympic games.</p>
<p>And there are several disciplines, right?</p>
<p>So the historically one of the first one</p>
<p>was the discipline in predicting the protein structure,</p>
<p>predicting the 3D coordinates of the protein.</p>
<p>But there are some others.</p>
<p>So the predicting protein functions,</p>
<p>predicting effects of mutations on protein functions,</p>
<p>then predicting protein, protein interactions.</p>
<p>So the original one was CASP</p>
<p>or a critical assessment of a protein structure.</p>
<p>And the, you know, typically what happens</p>
<p>during this competitions is, you know, scientists,</p>
<p>experimental scientists solve the structures,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t put them into the protein data bank,</p>
<p>which is the centralized database</p>
<p>that contains all the 3D coordinates.</p>
<p>Instead, they hold it and release protein sequences.</p>
<p>And now the challenge of the community</p>
<p>is to predict the 3D structures of this proteins</p>
<p>and then use the experimental results structures</p>
<p>to assess which one is the closest one, right?</p>
<p>And this competition, by the way,</p>
<p>just a bunch of different tangents.</p>
<p>And maybe you can also say, what is protein folding?</p>
<p>Then this competition, CASP competition</p>
<p>has become the gold standard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what was used to say</p>
<p>that protein folding was solved.</p>
<p>So just to add a little, just a bunch.</p>
<p>So if you could, whenever you say stuff,</p>
<p>maybe throw in some of the basics</p>
<p>for the folks that might be outside of the field.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>So, yeah, so, you know, so the reason it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s relevant to our understanding of protein folding</p>
<p>is because, you know, we&rsquo;ve yet to learn</p>
<p>how the folding mechanistically works, right?</p>
<p>So there are different hypothesis,</p>
<p>what happens to this fold?</p>
<p>For example, there is a hypothesis that the folding happens</p>
<p>by, you know, also in the modular fashion, right?</p>
<p>So that, you know, we have protein domains</p>
<p>that get folded independently</p>
<p>because their structure is stable.</p>
<p>And then the whole protein structure gets formed.</p>
<p>But, you know, within those domains,</p>
<p>we also have a so called secondary structure,</p>
<p>the small alpha helices, beta schists.</p>
<p>So these are, you know, elements that are structurally stable.</p>
<p>And so, and the question is, you know,</p>
<p>when do they get formed?</p>
<p>Because some of the secondary structure elements,</p>
<p>you have to have, you know, a fragment in the beginning</p>
<p>and say the fragment in the middle, right?</p>
<p>So you cannot potentially start having the full fold</p>
<p>from the get go, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still, you know, it&rsquo;s still a big enigma,</p>
<p>what happens.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s an extremely efficient</p>
<p>and stable process, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this long sequence</p>
<p>and the fold happens really quickly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really weird, right?</p>
<p>And it happens like the same way almost every time.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s freaking weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such an amazing thing.</p>
<p>But most importantly, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, so when you see the, you know,</p>
<p>the translation process, right?</p>
<p>So when you don&rsquo;t have the whole protein translated,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s still being translated,</p>
<p>you know, getting out from the ribosome,</p>
<p>you already see some structural, you know, fragmentation.</p>
<p>So folding starts happening</p>
<p>before the whole protein gets produced, right?</p>
<p>And so this is obviously, you know,</p>
<p>one of the biggest questions in, you know,</p>
<p>in modern molecular biologists.</p>
<p>Not like maybe what happens,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not as bigger than the question of folding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question of like,</p>
<p>something like deeper fundamental idea of folding.</p>
<p>Yes. Behind folding.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, so obviously if we are able to predict</p>
<p>the end product of protein folding,</p>
<p>we are one step closer to understanding</p>
<p>sort of the mechanisms of the protein folding.</p>
<p>Because we can then potentially look and start probing</p>
<p>what are the critical parts of this process</p>
<p>and what are not so critical parts of this process.</p>
<p>So we can start decomposing this, you know,</p>
<p>so in a way this protein structure prediction algorithm</p>
<p>can be used as a tool, right?</p>
<p>So you change the, you know, you modify the protein,</p>
<p>you get back to this tool, it predicts,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s completely unstable.</p>
<p>Yeah, which aspects of the input</p>
<p>will have a big impact on the output?</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So what happens is, you know,</p>
<p>we typically have some sort of incremental advancement,</p>
<p>you know, each stage of this CASP competition,</p>
<p>you have groups with incremental advancement</p>
<p>and, you know, historically the top performing groups</p>
<p>were, you know, they were not using machine learning.</p>
<p>They were using a very advanced biophysics</p>
<p>combined with bioinformatics,</p>
<p>combined with, you know, the data mining</p>
<p>and that was, you know, that would enable them</p>
<p>to obtain protein structures of those proteins</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have any structurally solved relatives</p>
<p>because, you know, if we have another protein,</p>
<p>say the same protein, but coming from a different species,</p>
<p>we could potentially derive some ideas</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s so called homology or comparative modeling,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll derive some ideas</p>
<p>from the previously known structures</p>
<p>and that would help us tremendously</p>
<p>in, you know, in reconstructing the 3D structure overall.</p>
<p>But what happens when we don&rsquo;t have these relatives?</p>
<p>This is when it becomes really, really hard, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s so called de novo, you know,</p>
<p>de novo protein structure prediction.</p>
<p>And in this case, those methods were traditionally very good.</p>
<p>But what happened in the last year,</p>
<p>the original alpha fold came into</p>
<p>and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s much better than everyone else.</p>
<p>This is 2018.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, and the competition is only every two years, I think.</p>
<p>And then, so, you know, it was sort of kind of over shockwave</p>
<p>to the bioinformatics community that, you know,</p>
<p>we have like a state of the art machine learning system</p>
<p>that does, you know, structure prediction.</p>
<p>And essentially what it does, you know,</p>
<p>so if you look at this, it actually predicts the context.</p>
<p>So, you know, so the process of reconstructing</p>
<p>the 3D structure starts by predicting the context</p>
<p>between the different parts of the protein.</p>
<p>And the context essentially is the parts of the proteins</p>
<p>that are in a close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>Right, so actually the machine learning part</p>
<p>seems to be estimating, you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here,</p>
<p>but it seems to be estimating the distance matrix,</p>
<p>which is like the distance between the different parts.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we call the contact map.</p>
<p>Contact map.</p>
<p>So once you have the contact map,</p>
<p>the reconstruction is becoming more straightforward, right?</p>
<p>But so the contact map is the key.</p>
<p>And so, you know, so that what happened.</p>
<p>And now we started seeing in this current stage, right?</p>
<p>Well, in the most recent one,</p>
<p>we started seeing the emergence of these ideas</p>
<p>in other people works, right?</p>
<p>But yet here&rsquo;s, you know, AlphaFold2</p>
<p>that again outperforms everyone else.</p>
<p>And also by introducing yet another wave</p>
<p>of the machine learning ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, there don&rsquo;t seem to be also an incorporation.</p>
<p>First of all, the paper is not out yet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of ideas already out.</p>
<p>There does seem to be an incorporation of this other thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s something that you could speak to,</p>
<p>which is like the incorporation of like other structures,</p>
<p>like evolutionary similar structures</p>
<p>that are used to kind of give you hints.</p>
<p>Yes, so evolutionary similarity is something</p>
<p>that we can detect at different levels, right?</p>
<p>So we know, for example,</p>
<p>that the structure of proteins</p>
<p>is more conserved than the sequence.</p>
<p>The sequence could be very different,</p>
<p>but the structural shape is actually still very conserved.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the intrinsic property that, you know,</p>
<p>in a way related to protein folds,</p>
<p>you know, to the evolution of the, you know,</p>
<p>of the proteins and protein domains, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we know that, I mean, there&rsquo;ve been multiple studies.</p>
<p>And, you know, ideally, if you have structures,</p>
<p>you know, you should use that information.</p>
<p>However, sometimes we don&rsquo;t have this information.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a bunch of sequences.</p>
<p>Sequences, we have a lot, right?</p>
<p>So we have, you know, hundreds, thousands</p>
<p>of, you know, different organisms sequenced, right?</p>
<p>And by taking the same protein,</p>
<p>but in different organisms and aligning it,</p>
<p>so making it, you know, making the corresponding positions</p>
<p>aligned, we can actually say a lot</p>
<p>about sort of what is conserved in this protein</p>
<p>and therefore, you know, structurally more stable,</p>
<p>what is diverse in this protein.</p>
<p>So on top of that, we could provide sort of the information</p>
<p>about the sort of the secondary structure</p>
<p>of this protein, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So this information is extremely useful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>So while it&rsquo;s tempting to, you know,</p>
<p>to do a complete ab initio,</p>
<p>so you just have a protein sequence and nothing else,</p>
<p>the reality is such that we are overwhelmed with this data.</p>
<p>So why not use it?</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so I&rsquo;m looking forward</p>
<p>to reading this paper.</p>
<p>It does seem to, like they&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>in the previous version of Alpha Fold,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t, for this evolutionary similarity thing,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t use machine learning for that.</p>
<p>Or rather, they used it as like the input</p>
<p>to the entirety of the neural net,</p>
<p>like the features derived from the similarity.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s some kind of quote, unquote,</p>
<p>iterative thing where it seems to be part of the learning</p>
<p>process is the incorporation of this evolutionary similarity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think there is a bioarchive paper, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a blog post that&rsquo;s written</p>
<p>by a marketing team, essentially,</p>
<p>which, you know, it has some scientific similarity,</p>
<p>probably, to the actual methodology used,</p>
<p>but it could be, it&rsquo;s like interpreting scripture.</p>
<p>It could be just poetic interpretations of the actual work</p>
<p>as opposed to direct connection to the work.</p>
<p>So now, speaking about protein folding, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, in order to answer the question</p>
<p>whether or not we have solved this, right?</p>
<p>So we need to go back to the beginning of our conversation</p>
<p>with the realization that an average protein</p>
<p>is that typically what the CASP has been focusing on</p>
<p>is this competition has been focusing</p>
<p>on the single, maybe two domain proteins</p>
<p>that are still very compact.</p>
<p>And even those ones are extremely challenging to solve.</p>
<p>But now we talk about, you know,</p>
<p>an average protein that has two, three protein domains.</p>
<p>If you look at the proteins that are in charge</p>
<p>of the, you know, of the process with the neural system,</p>
<p>right, perhaps one of the most recently evolved</p>
<p>sort of systems in an organism, right?</p>
<p>All of them, well, the majority of them</p>
<p>are highly multi domain proteins.</p>
<p>So they are, you know, some of them have five, six, seven,</p>
<p>you know, and more domains, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, we are very far away</p>
<p>from understanding how these proteins are folded.</p>
<p>So the complexity of the protein matters here.</p>
<p>The complexity of the protein modules</p>
<p>or the protein domains.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying solved, so the definition</p>
<p>of solved here is particularly the CASP competition</p>
<p>achieving human level, not human level,</p>
<p>achieving experimental level performance</p>
<p>on these particular sets of proteins</p>
<p>that have been used in these competitions.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, I do think that, you know,</p>
<p>especially with regards to the alpha fold,</p>
<p>you know, it is able to, you know, to solve,</p>
<p>you know, at the near experimental level,</p>
<p>pre big majority of the more compact proteins</p>
<p>like, or protein domains.</p>
<p>Because again, in order to understand</p>
<p>how the overall protein, you know,</p>
<p>multi domain protein fold, we do need to understand</p>
<p>the structure of its individual domains.</p>
<p>I mean, unlike if you look at alpha zero</p>
<p>or like even mu zero, if you look at that work,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s nice reinforcement learning</p>
<p>self playing mechanisms are nice</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s all in simulation.</p>
<p>So you can learn from just huge amounts.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t need data.</p>
<p>It was like the problem with proteins,</p>
<p>like the size, I forget how many 3D structures</p>
<p>have been mapped, but the training data is very small.</p>
<p>No matter what, it&rsquo;s like millions,</p>
<p>maybe a one or two million or something like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s some very small number,</p>
<p>but like, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that&rsquo;s scalable.</p>
<p>There has to be, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it feels like you want to somehow 10 X the data</p>
<p>or a hundred X the data somehow.</p>
<p>Yes, but we also can take advantage of homology models,</p>
<p>right, so the models that are of very good quality</p>
<p>because they are essentially obtained</p>
<p>based on the evolutionary information, right?</p>
<p>So you can, there is a potential to enhance this information</p>
<p>and, you know, use it again to empower the training set.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I think, I am actually very optimistic.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been one of this sort of, you know,</p>
<p>churning events where you have a system that is,</p>
<p>you know, a machine learning system</p>
<p>that is truly better than the machine learning system.</p>
<p>Better than the sort of the more conventional</p>
<p>biophysics based methods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge leap.</p>
<p>This is one of those fun questions,</p>
<p>but where would you put it in the ranking</p>
<p>of the greatest breakthroughs</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence history?</p>
<p>So like, okay, so let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s in the running.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>So you got like AlphaZero and AlphaGo</p>
<p>beating the world champion at the game of Go.</p>
<p>Thought to be impossible like 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Or at least the AI community was highly skeptical.</p>
<p>Then you got like also Deep Blue original Kasparov.</p>
<p>You have deep learning itself,</p>
<p>like the maybe, what would you say,</p>
<p>the AlexNet, ImageNet moment.</p>
<p>So the first neural network</p>
<p>achieving human level performance.</p>
<p>Super, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Achieving like a big leap in performance</p>
<p>on the computer vision problem.</p>
<p>There is OpenAI, the whole like GPT3,</p>
<p>that whole space of transformers and language models</p>
<p>just achieving this incredible performance</p>
<p>of application of neural networks to language models.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, pretty cool.</p>
<p>Like robotics.</p>
<p>People are like, there&rsquo;s no AI.</p>
<p>No, no, there&rsquo;s no machine learning currently.</p>
<p>But AI is much bigger than machine learning.</p>
<p>So that just the engineering aspect,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s one of the greatest accomplishments</p>
<p>in engineering side.</p>
<p>Engineering meaning like mechanical engineering</p>
<p>of robotics ever.</p>
<p>Then of course, autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>You can argue for Waymo,</p>
<p>which is like the Google self driving car.</p>
<p>Or you can argue for Tesla,</p>
<p>which is like actually being used</p>
<p>by hundreds of thousands of people on the road today,</p>
<p>machine learning system.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you can, what else is there?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And then AlphaFold, many people are saying</p>
<p>is up there, potentially number one.</p>
<p>Would you put them at number one?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of the impact on the science</p>
<p>and on the society beyond, it&rsquo;s definitely,</p>
<p>to me would be one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Top three?</p>
<p>What you want?</p>
<p>Maybe, I mean, I&rsquo;m probably not the best person</p>
<p>to answer that.</p>
<p>But I do have, I remember my,</p>
<p>back in, I think 1997, when Deep Blue,</p>
<p>that Kasparov, it was, I mean, it was a shock.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, and I think for the,</p>
<p>for the pre substantial part of the world,</p>
<p>that especially people who have some experience with chess,</p>
<p>and realizing how incredibly human this game,</p>
<p>how much of a brain power you need</p>
<p>to reach those levels of grandmasters, right, level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably one of the first time,</p>
<p>and how good Kasparov was.</p>
<p>And again, yeah, so Kasparov&rsquo;s arguably</p>
<p>one of the best ever, right?</p>
<p>And you get a machine that beats him.</p>
<p>All right, so it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>First time a machine probably beat a human</p>
<p>at that scale of a thing, of anything.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So that was, to me, that was like, you know,</p>
<p>one of the groundbreaking events in the history of AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably number one.</p>
<p>Probably, like we don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Muhammad Ali versus, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>any of the Mike Tyson, something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, nah, you gotta put Muhammad Ali at number one.</p>
<p>Same with Deep Blue,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not machine learning based.</p>
<p>Still, it uses advanced search,</p>
<p>and search is the integral part of AI, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, people don&rsquo;t think of it that way at this moment.</p>
<p>In vogue currently, search is not seen</p>
<p>as a fundamental aspect of intelligence,</p>
<p>but it very well, I mean, it very likely is.</p>
<p>In fact, I mean, that&rsquo;s what neural networks are,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re just performing search</p>
<p>on the space of parameters, and it&rsquo;s all search.</p>
<p>All of intelligence is some form of search,</p>
<p>and you just have to become cleverer and clever</p>
<p>at that search problem.</p>
<p>And I also have another one that you didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of my favorite ones is,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve probably heard of this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s called Deep Rembrandt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the project where they trained,</p>
<p>I think there was a collaboration</p>
<p>between the sort of the experts</p>
<p>in Rembrandt painting in Netherlands,</p>
<p>and a group, an artificial intelligence group,</p>
<p>where they train an algorithm</p>
<p>to replicate the style of the Rembrandt,</p>
<p>and they actually printed a portrait</p>
<p>that never existed before in the style of Rembrandt.</p>
<p>I think they printed it on a sort of,</p>
<p>on the canvas that, you know,</p>
<p>using pretty much same types of paints and stuff.</p>
<p>To me, it was mind blowing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the space of art, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been, maybe that&rsquo;s it,</p>
<p>but I think there hasn&rsquo;t been an image in that moment yet</p>
<p>in the space of art.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been able to achieve</p>
<p>superhuman level performance in the space of art,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s this big famous thing</p>
<p>where a piece of art was purchased,</p>
<p>I guess for a lot of money.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>people are like in the space of music at least,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s clear that human created pieces</p>
<p>are much more popular.</p>
<p>So there hasn&rsquo;t been a moment where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, this is, we&rsquo;re now,</p>
<p>I would say in the space of music,</p>
<p>what makes a lot of money,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about serious money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s music and movies, or like shows and so on,</p>
<p>and entertainment.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a moment where AI created,</p>
<p>AI was able to create a piece of music</p>
<p>or a piece of cinema, like Netflix show,</p>
<p>that is, you know, that&rsquo;s sufficiently popular</p>
<p>to make a ton of money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that moment would be very, very powerful,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s an AI system</p>
<p>being used to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>And like direct, of course, AI tools,</p>
<p>like even Premiere, audio editing,</p>
<p>all the editing, everything I do,</p>
<p>to edit this podcast, there&rsquo;s a lot of AI involved.</p>
<p>Actually, this is a program,</p>
<p>I wanna talk to those folks, just cause I wanna nerd out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called iZotope, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with it.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of tools of audio processing,</p>
<p>and they have, I think they&rsquo;re Boston based,</p>
<p>just, it&rsquo;s so exciting to me to use it,</p>
<p>like on the audio here,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s all machine learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, cause most audio production stuff</p>
<p>is like any kind of processing you do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very basic signal processing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re tuning knobs and so on.</p>
<p>They have all of that, of course,</p>
<p>but they also have all of this machine learning stuff,</p>
<p>like where you actually give it training data,</p>
<p>you select parts of the audio you train on,</p>
<p>you train on it, and it figures stuff out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s able to detect,</p>
<p>like the ability of it to be able</p>
<p>to separate voice and music, for example,</p>
<p>or voice and anything, is incredible.</p>
<p>Like it just, it&rsquo;s clearly exceptionally good</p>
<p>at applying these different neural networks models</p>
<p>to just separate the different kinds</p>
<p>of signals from the audio.</p>
<p>That, okay, so that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>Photoshop, Adobe people also use it,</p>
<p>but to generate a piece of music</p>
<p>that will sell millions, a piece of art, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I agree, and you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>I offer my AI class, and you know,</p>
<p>an integral part of this is the project, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s my favorite, ultimate favorite part,</p>
<p>because it typically, we have these project presentations</p>
<p>the last two weeks of the classes,</p>
<p>right before, you know, the Christmas break,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of, it adds this cool excitement,</p>
<p>and every time, I mean, I&rsquo;m amazed, you know,</p>
<p>with some projects that people, you know, come up with.</p>
<p>And so, and quite a few of them are actually, you know,</p>
<p>they have some link to arts.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I think last year we had a group</p>
<p>who designed an AI producing hokus, Japanese poems.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So, and some of them, so, you know,</p>
<p>it got trained on the English based,</p>
<p>haikus, haikus, right?</p>
<p>So, and some of them, you know,</p>
<p>they get to present, like, the top selection.</p>
<p>They were pretty good.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I mean, of course, I&rsquo;m not a specialist,</p>
<p>but you read them, and you see this is real.</p>
<p>It seems profound.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, it seems real.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>We also had a couple of projects where people tried</p>
<p>to teach AI how to play, like, rock music, classical music.</p>
<p>I think, and popular music.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, you know,</p>
<p>classical music was among the most difficult ones.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>And, you know, of course, if you, if, you know,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at the, you know,</p>
<p>the, like, grandmasters of music, like Bach, right?</p>
<p>So there is a lot of, there is a lot of,</p>
<p>there is a lot of almost math.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he&rsquo;s very mathematical.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So this is, I would imagine that at least some style</p>
<p>of this music could be picked up,</p>
<p>but then you have this completely different spectrum</p>
<p>of classical composers.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to sort of look at the data.</p>
<p>You just listen to it and say, nah, that&rsquo;s not it, not yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not it, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s OpenAI has, I think, OpenMuse</p>
<p>or something like that, the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool, but it&rsquo;s like, eh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not compelling for some reason.</p>
<p>It could be a psychological reason too.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to have a human being,</p>
<p>a tortured soul behind the music.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>But yeah, whether or not we&rsquo;ll have,</p>
<p>one day we&rsquo;ll have, you know,</p>
<p>a song written by an AI engine</p>
<p>to be like in top charts, musical charts,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>I wonder if we already have one</p>
<p>and it just hasn&rsquo;t been announced.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How hard is the multi protein folding problem?</p>
<p>Is that kind of something you&rsquo;ve already mentioned</p>
<p>which is baked into this idea of greater</p>
<p>and greater complexity of proteins?</p>
<p>Like multi domain proteins,</p>
<p>is that basically become multi protein complexes?</p>
<p>Yes, you got it right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of, it has the components</p>
<p>of both of protein folding</p>
<p>and protein, protein interactions.</p>
<p>Because in order for these domains,</p>
<p>many of these proteins actually,</p>
<p>they never form a stable structure.</p>
<p>One of my favorite proteins,</p>
<p>and pretty much everyone who works in the,</p>
<p>I know, whom I know, who works with proteins,</p>
<p>they always have their favorite proteins.</p>
<p>Right, so one of my favorite proteins,</p>
<p>probably my favorite protein,</p>
<p>the one that I worked when I was a postdoc</p>
<p>is so called post synaptic density 95, PSD 95 protein.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the key actors</p>
<p>in the majority of neurological processes</p>
<p>at the molecular level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, and essentially it&rsquo;s a key player</p>
<p>in the post synaptic density.</p>
<p>So this is the crucial part of this synapse</p>
<p>where a lot of these chemical processes are happening.</p>
<p>So it has five domains, right?</p>
<p>So five protein domains.</p>
<p>So pretty large proteins, I think 600 something assets.</p>
<p>But the way it&rsquo;s organized itself, it&rsquo;s flexible, right?</p>
<p>So it acts as a scaffold.</p>
<p>So it is used to bring in other proteins.</p>
<p>So they start acting in the orchestrated manner, right?</p>
<p>So, and the type of the shape of this protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a way, there are some stable parts of this protein,</p>
<p>but there are some flexible.</p>
<p>And this flexibility is built in into the protein</p>
<p>in order to become sort of this multifunctional machine.</p>
<p>So do you think that kind of thing is also learnable</p>
<p>through the alpha fold two kind of approach?</p>
<p>I mean, the time will tell.</p>
<p>Is it another level of complexity?</p>
<p>Is it like how big of a jump in complexity</p>
<p>is that whole thing?</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s yet another level of complexity</p>
<p>because when we talk about protein, protein interactions,</p>
<p>and there is actually a different challenge for this</p>
<p>called Capri, and so this, that is focused specifically</p>
<p>on macromolecular interactions, protein, protein, protein,</p>
<p>DNA, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s, there are different mechanisms</p>
<p>that govern molecular interactions</p>
<p>and that need to be picked up,</p>
<p>say by a machine learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, we actually,</p>
<p>we participated for a few years in this competition.</p>
<p>We typically don&rsquo;t participate in competitions,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t have enough time,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very intensive, it&rsquo;s a very intensive process.</p>
<p>But we participated back in about 10 years ago or so.</p>
<p>And the way we entered this competition,</p>
<p>so we design a scoring function, right?</p>
<p>So the function that evaluates</p>
<p>whether or not your protein, protein interaction</p>
<p>is supposed to look like experimentally solved, right?</p>
<p>So the scoring function is very critical part</p>
<p>of the model prediction.</p>
<p>So we designed it to be a machine learning one.</p>
<p>And so it was one of the first machine learning</p>
<p>based scoring function used in Capri.</p>
<p>And we essentially learned what should contribute,</p>
<p>what are the critical components contributing</p>
<p>into the protein, protein interaction.</p>
<p>So this could be converted into a learning problem</p>
<p>and thereby it could be learned?</p>
<p>I believe so, yes.</p>
<p>Do you think AlphaFold2 or something similar to it</p>
<p>from DeepMind or somebody else will be,</p>
<p>will result in a Nobel Prize or multiple Nobel Prizes?</p>
<p>So like, you know, obviously, maybe not so obviously,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t give a Nobel Prize to a computer program.</p>
<p>At least for now, give it to the designers of that program.</p>
<p>But do you see one or multiple Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>where AlphaFold2 is like a large percentage</p>
<p>of what that prize is given for?</p>
<p>Would it lead to discoveries at the level of Nobel Prizes?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we are definitely destined</p>
<p>to see the Nobel Prize becoming sort of,</p>
<p>to be evolving with the evolution of science</p>
<p>and the evolution of science as such</p>
<p>that it now becomes like really multi facets, right?</p>
<p>So where you don&rsquo;t really have like a unique discipline,</p>
<p>you have sort of the, a lot of cross disciplinary talks</p>
<p>in order to achieve sort of, you know,</p>
<p>really big advancements, you know.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, the computational methods</p>
<p>will be acknowledged in one way or another.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, you know,</p>
<p>they were first acknowledged back in 2013, right?</p>
<p>Where, you know, the first three people were, you know,</p>
<p>awarded the Nobel Prize for study the protein folding,</p>
<p>right, the principle.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think all three of them</p>
<p>are computational biophysicists, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, that I think is unavoidable.</p>
<p>You know, it will come with the time.</p>
<p>The fact that, you know, alpha fold and, you know,</p>
<p>similar approaches, because again, it&rsquo;s a matter of time</p>
<p>that people will embrace this, you know, principle</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see more and more such, you know,</p>
<p>such tools coming into play.</p>
<p>But, you know, these methods will be critical</p>
<p>in a scientific discovery, no doubts about it.</p>
<p>On the engineering side, maybe a dark question,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s possible to use</p>
<p>these machine learning methods</p>
<p>to start to engineer proteins?</p>
<p>And the next question is something quite a few biologists</p>
<p>are against, some are for, for study purposes,</p>
<p>is to engineer viruses.</p>
<p>Do you think machine learning, like something like alpha fold</p>
<p>could be used to engineer viruses?</p>
<p>So to answer the first question, you know,</p>
<p>it has been, you know, a part of the research</p>
<p>in the protein science, the protein design is, you know,</p>
<p>is a very prominent areas of research.</p>
<p>Of course, you know, one of the pioneers is David Baker</p>
<p>and Rosetta algorithm that, you know,</p>
<p>essentially was doing the de novo design and was used</p>
<p>to design new proteins, you know.</p>
<p>And design of proteins means design of function.</p>
<p>So like when you design a protein, you can control,</p>
<p>I mean, the whole point of a protein</p>
<p>with the protein structure comes a function,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s doing something.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So you can design different things.</p>
<p>So you can, yeah, so you can, well,</p>
<p>you can look at the proteins from the functional perspective.</p>
<p>You can also look at the proteins</p>
<p>from the structural perspective, right?</p>
<p>So the structural building blocks.</p>
<p>So if you want to have a building block</p>
<p>of a certain shape, you can try to achieve it</p>
<p>by, you know, introducing a new protein sequence</p>
<p>and predicting, you know, how it will fold.</p>
<p>So with that, I mean, it&rsquo;s a natural,</p>
<p>one of the, you know, natural applications</p>
<p>of these algorithms.</p>
<p>Now, talking about engineering a virus.</p>
<p>With machine learning.</p>
<p>With machine learning, right?</p>
<p>So, well, you know, so luckily for us,</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have that much data, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We actually, right now, one of the projects</p>
<p>that we are carrying on in the lab</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re trying to develop a machine learning algorithm</p>
<p>that determines the,</p>
<p>whether or not the current strain is pathogenic.</p>
<p>And the current strain of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Of the virus.</p>
<p>I mean, so there are applications to coronaviruses</p>
<p>because we have strains of SARS COVID 2,</p>
<p>also SARS COVID, MERS that are pathogenic,</p>
<p>but we also have strains of other coronaviruses</p>
<p>that are, you know, not pathogenic.</p>
<p>I mean, the common cold viruses and, you know,</p>
<p>some other ones, right?</p>
<p>So, so pathogenic meaning spreading.</p>
<p>Pathogenic means actually inflicting damage.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>There are also some, you know,</p>
<p>seasonal versus pandemic strains of influenza, right?</p>
<p>And determining the, what are the molecular determinant,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that are built in, into the protein sequence,</p>
<p>into the gene sequence, right?</p>
<p>So, and whether or not the machine learning</p>
<p>can determine those, those components, right?</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So like using machine learning to do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting to, to, to given,</p>
<p>give the input is like what the entire,</p>
<p>the protein sequence and then determine</p>
<p>if this thing is going to be able to do damage</p>
<p>to a biological system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so I mean,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good machine learning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying we don&rsquo;t have enough data for that?</p>
<p>We, I mean, for, for this specific one, we do.</p>
<p>We might actually, I have, you know,</p>
<p>have to back up on this because we&rsquo;re still in the process.</p>
<p>There was one work that appeared in bioarchive</p>
<p>by Eugene Kunin, who is one of these, you know,</p>
<p>pioneers in, in, in evolutionary genomics.</p>
<p>And they tried to look at this, but, you know,</p>
<p>the methods were sort of standard, you know,</p>
<p>supervised learning methods.</p>
<p>And now the question is, you know,</p>
<p>can you advance it further by, by using, you know,</p>
<p>not so standard methods, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of hope in,</p>
<p>in transfer learning where you can actually try to transfer</p>
<p>the information that the machine learning learns about</p>
<p>the proper protein sequences, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, so, so there is some promise</p>
<p>in going this direction, but if we have this,</p>
<p>it would be extremely useful because then</p>
<p>we could essentially forecast the potential mutations</p>
<p>that would make the current strain</p>
<p>more or less pathogenic.</p>
<p>Anticipate, anticipate them from a vaccine development,</p>
<p>for the treatment, antiviral drug development.</p>
<p>That, that would be a very crucial task.</p>
<p>But you could also use that system to then say,</p>
<p>how would we potentially modify this virus</p>
<p>to make it more pathogenic?</p>
<p>This, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the, again,</p>
<p>the hope is, well, several things, right?</p>
<p>So one is that, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>even if you design a, you know, a sequence, right?</p>
<p>So to carry out the actual experimental biology,</p>
<p>to ensure that all the components working, you know,</p>
<p>is a completely different matter.</p>
<p>Difficult process.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then the, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen in the past,</p>
<p>there could be some regulation of the moment</p>
<p>the scientific community recognizes</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s now becoming no longer a sort of a fun puzzle</p>
<p>to, you know, for machine learning.</p>
<p>Could be open.</p>
<p>Yeah, so then there might be some regulation.</p>
<p>So I think back in, what, 2015, there was, you know,</p>
<p>there was an issue on regulating the research</p>
<p>on influenza strains, right?</p>
<p>There were several groups, you know,</p>
<p>used sort of the mutation analysis</p>
<p>to determine whether or not this strain will jump</p>
<p>from one species to another.</p>
<p>And I think there was like a half a year moratorium</p>
<p>on the research on the paper published</p>
<p>until, you know, scientists, you know, analyzed it</p>
<p>and decided that it&rsquo;s actually safe.</p>
<p>I forgot what that&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Something of function, test of function.</p>
<p>Gain of function.</p>
<p>Gain of function, yeah.</p>
<p>Gain of function, loss of function, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s watch this thing mutate for a while</p>
<p>to see like, to see what kind of things we can observe.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m not so much worried</p>
<p>about that kind of research if there&rsquo;s a lot of regulation</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s done very well and with competence and seriously.</p>
<p>I am more worried about kind of this, you know,</p>
<p>the underlying aspect of this question</p>
<p>is more like 50 years from now.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Drake equation,</p>
<p>one of the parameters in the Drake equation</p>
<p>is how long civilizations last.</p>
<p>And that seems to be the most important value actually</p>
<p>for calculating if there&rsquo;s other alien</p>
<p>intelligent civilizations out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s most variability.</p>
<p>Assuming like if life, if that percentage</p>
<p>that life can emerge is like not zero,</p>
<p>like if we&rsquo;re a super unique,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s the how long we last</p>
<p>is basically the most important thing.</p>
<p>So from a selfish perspective,</p>
<p>but also from a Drake equation perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about our civilization lasting.</p>
<p>And you kind of think about all the ways</p>
<p>in which machine learning can be used</p>
<p>to design greater weapons of destruction, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, one way to ask that</p>
<p>if you look sort of 50 years from now,</p>
<p>a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>would you be more worried about natural pandemics</p>
<p>or engineered pandemics?</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s the better designer of viruses,</p>
<p>nature or humans if we look down the line?</p>
<p>I think in my view, I would still be worried</p>
<p>about the natural pandemics simply because I mean,</p>
<p>the capacity of the nature producing this.</p>
<p>It does pretty good job, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the motivation for using virus,</p>
<p>engineering viruses as a weapon is a weird one</p>
<p>because maybe you can correct me on this,</p>
<p>but it seems very difficult to target a virus, right?</p>
<p>The whole point of a weapon, the way a rocket works,</p>
<p>if a starting point, you have an end point</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to hit a target,</p>
<p>to hit a target with a virus is very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just, right?</p>
<p>The target would be the human species.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a hope in us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forever optimistic that we will not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s insufficient evil in the world</p>
<p>to lead to that kind of destruction.</p>
<p>Well, I also hope that, I mean, that&rsquo;s what we see.</p>
<p>I mean, with the way we are getting connected,</p>
<p>the world is getting connected.</p>
<p>I think it helps for the world to become more transparent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the information spread is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the key things for the society</p>
<p>to become more balanced one way or another.</p>
<p>This is something that people disagree with me on,</p>
<p>but I do think that the kind of secrecy</p>
<p>that governments have.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of speaking more to the other aspects,</p>
<p>like a research community being more open,</p>
<p>companies are being more open.</p>
<p>Government is still like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about like military secrets.</p>
<p>I think military secrets of the kind</p>
<p>that could destroy the world</p>
<p>will become also a thing of the 20th century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll become more and more open.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think nations will lose power in the 21st century,</p>
<p>like lose sufficient power towards secrecies.</p>
<p>Transparency is more beneficial than secrecy,</p>
<p>but of course it&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope so.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope so that the governments</p>
<p>will become more transparent.</p>
<p>What, so we last talked, I think in March or April,</p>
<p>what have you learned?</p>
<p>How has your philosophical, psychological,</p>
<p>biological worldview changed since then?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;ve been studying it nonstop</p>
<p>from a computational biology perspective.</p>
<p>How has your understanding and thoughts about this virus</p>
<p>changed over those months from the beginning to today?</p>
<p>One thing that I was really amazed at</p>
<p>how efficient the scientific community was.</p>
<p>I mean, and even just judging on this very narrow domain</p>
<p>of protein structure and understanding</p>
<p>the structural characterization of this virus</p>
<p>from the components point of view,</p>
<p>whole virus point of view.</p>
<p>If you look at SARS, something that happened less than 20,</p>
<p>but close enough, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>and you see what, when it happened,</p>
<p>what was sort of the response by the scientific community,</p>
<p>you see that the structure characterizations did a cure,</p>
<p>but it took several years, right?</p>
<p>Now the things that took several years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a matter of months, right?</p>
<p>So we see that the research pop up.</p>
<p>We are at the unprecedented level</p>
<p>in terms of the sequencing, right?</p>
<p>Never before we had a single virus sequence so many times,</p>
<p>so which allows us to actually to trace very precisely</p>
<p>the sort of the evolutionary nature of this virus,</p>
<p>what happens, and it&rsquo;s not just this virus independently</p>
<p>of everything, it&rsquo;s the sequence of this virus</p>
<p>linked, anchored to the specific geographic place</p>
<p>to specific</p>
<p>people, because our genotype influences also</p>
<p>the evolution of this, it&rsquo;s always a host pathogen,</p>
<p>core evolution that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the virus, it&rsquo;s the sequence of this virus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sequence of this virus linked to the specific</p>
<p>geographic place, it&rsquo;s the sequence of this virus</p>
<p>linked to the specific geographic place to specific people,</p>
<p>that, you know, occurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool if we also had a lot more data about,</p>
<p>so that the spread of this virus, not maybe,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;d be nice if we had it for like contact tracing</p>
<p>purposes for this virus, but it&rsquo;d be also nice if we had it</p>
<p>for the study for future viruses to be able to respond</p>
<p>and so on, but it&rsquo;s already nice that we have geographical</p>
<p>data and the basic data from individual humans, yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly, no, I think contact tracing is obviously</p>
<p>a key component in understanding</p>
<p>the spread of this virus.</p>
<p>There is also, there is a number of challenges, right?</p>
<p>So XPRIZE is one of them, we</p>
<p>just recently took a part of</p>
<p>this competition, it&rsquo;s the prediction of the</p>
<p>number of infections in different regions.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>So, you know, obviously the AI</p>
<p>is the main topic in those predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still, the data, I mean, that&rsquo;s a competition,</p>
<p>but the data is weak</p>
<p>on the training. Like, it&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more than probably before, but like, it&rsquo;d be nice if it was like</p>
<p>really rich. I talked to Michael Mina from</p>
<p>Harvard, I mean, he dreams that the community comes together with like a</p>
<p>weather map to where viruses, right, like</p>
<p>really high resolution sensors on like how</p>
<p>from person to person the viruses that travel, all the different kinds of viruses, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a ton of them, and then you&rsquo;d be able to tell</p>
<p>the story that you&rsquo;ve spoken about</p>
<p>of the evolution of these viruses, like day to day mutations that</p>
<p>are occurring. I mean, that&rsquo;d be fascinating just from a perspective of</p>
<p>study and from the perspective of being able to respond to future pandemics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ultimately what I&rsquo;m worried about. People love</p>
<p>books. Is there some three</p>
<p>or whatever number of books, technical, fiction, philosophical, that</p>
<p>brought you joy in life, had an impact on your life,</p>
<p>and maybe some that you would recommend others?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you three very different books, and I also have a special runner up.</p>
<p>Honorable mention.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an audiobook, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some specific reason behind it. So the first book is</p>
<p>something that sort of impacted my earlier</p>
<p>stage of life, and I&rsquo;m probably not going to be very original here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Bulgakov&rsquo;s Master and Margarita.</p>
<p>For a Russian, maybe it&rsquo;s not super original,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really powerful book, even in English.</p>
<p>It is incredibly powerful, and</p>
<p>I mean, the way it ends.</p>
<p>I still have goosebumps when I read</p>
<p>the very last sort of, it&rsquo;s called prologue, where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so powerful. What impact did it have on you? What ideas?</p>
<p>What insights did you get from it? I was just taken by</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>you have those parallel lives</p>
<p>apart from many centuries, and</p>
<p>somehow they got sort of intertwined into</p>
<p>one story, and that</p>
<p>to me was fascinating. And of course</p>
<p>the romantic part of this book is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just romance, it&rsquo;s like the romance</p>
<p>empowered by sort of magic, right?</p>
<p>And maybe on top of that, you have some irony,</p>
<p>which is unavoidable, right? Because it was that</p>
<p>Soviet time. But it&rsquo;s very deeply Russian, so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the wit, the humor, the pain, the love,</p>
<p>all of that is one of the books that kind of captures</p>
<p>something about Russian culture that people outside of Russia</p>
<p>should probably read. I agree. What&rsquo;s the second one? So the second one</p>
<p>is again another one that it happened</p>
<p>I read it later in my life. I think I read it</p>
<p>first time when I was a graduate student.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s Cancer Word.</p>
<p>That is amazingly powerful book.</p>
<p>What is it about? It&rsquo;s about, I mean, essentially</p>
<p>based on Solzhenitsyn was</p>
<p>diagnosed with cancer when he was reasonably young, and he</p>
<p>made a full recovery. So this is</p>
<p>about a person who was sentenced</p>
<p>for life in one of these camps.</p>
<p>And he had some cancer,</p>
<p>so he was transported back to one of these</p>
<p>Soviet republics, I think it was</p>
<p>South Asian republics. And the</p>
<p>book is about</p>
<p>his experience being a</p>
<p>prisoner, being a patient in the</p>
<p>cancer clinic, in the cancer ward, surrounded</p>
<p>by people, many of which die.</p>
<p>But in the way</p>
<p>it reads, first of all, later on I</p>
<p>read the accounts of the doctors</p>
<p>who describe the experiences</p>
<p>in the book by the</p>
<p>patient as incredibly accurate.</p>
<p>So I read that there was some doctor saying that</p>
<p>every single doctor should read this book to understand</p>
<p>what the patient feels. But</p>
<p>again, as many of the Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>books, it has multiple levels of complexity.</p>
<p>And obviously if you look above</p>
<p>the cancer and the patient, the</p>
<p>tumor that was growing and then disappeared</p>
<p>in his</p>
<p>body with some consequences, this is</p>
<p>allegorically the</p>
<p>Soviet, and he actually</p>
<p>when he was asked, he said that this is what made him</p>
<p>think about this, how to combine these experiences.</p>
<p>Him being a part of the Soviet regime,</p>
<p>also being a part of the</p>
<p>someone sent to Gulag camp,</p>
<p>and also someone who experienced cancer</p>
<p>in his life. The Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p>and this book, these are the works that actually made him</p>
<p>receive a Nobel Prize. But to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>other books by Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p>This one to me is the most powerful one.</p>
<p>And by the way, both this one and the previous one you read in Russian?</p>
<p>Yes. So now there is the third book is an English book</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely different. So we&rsquo;re switching the gears</p>
<p>completely. So this is the book which, it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>a book, it&rsquo;s an essay by</p>
<p>Jonathan Neumann called The Computer and the Brain.</p>
<p>And that was the book he was writing</p>
<p>knowing that he was dying of cancer.</p>
<p>So the book was released back, it&rsquo;s a very thin book.</p>
<p>But the power,</p>
<p>the intellectual power in this book, in this essay</p>
<p>is incredible. I mean you probably know that von Neumann</p>
<p>is considered to be one of the biggest</p>
<p>thinkers. So his intellectual power was incredible.</p>
<p>And you can actually feel this power</p>
<p>in this book where the person is writing knowing that he will be,</p>
<p>he will die. The book actually got published only after his</p>
<p>death back in 1958. He died in 1957.</p>
<p>So he tried to put as many</p>
<p>ideas that he still</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t realized.</p>
<p>So this book is very difficult</p>
<p>to read because every single paragraph</p>
<p>is just compact, is</p>
<p>filled with these ideas. And the ideas are incredible.</p>
<p>Even nowadays, so he tried</p>
<p>to put the parallels between the brain</p>
<p>computing power, the neural system, and the computers</p>
<p>as they were understood. Do you remember what year he was working on this?</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>
<ol start="57">
<li>So that was right during his,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>when he was diagnosed with cancer and he was essentially&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s one of those, there&rsquo;s a few folks people mention,</p>
<p>I think Ed Witten is another that like</p>
<p>everyone that meets them, they say he&rsquo;s just an intellectual powerhouse.</p>
<p>Yes. Okay, so who&rsquo;s the honorable mention?</p>
<p>And this is, I mean, the reason I put it sort of in a separate section</p>
<p>because this is a book that I recently</p>
<p>listened to. So it&rsquo;s an audio book.</p>
<p>And this is a book called Lab Girl by Hope Jarron.</p>
<p>So Hope Jarron, she is a</p>
<p>scientist, she&rsquo;s a geochemist that essentially</p>
<p>studies the</p>
<p>fossil plants. And so she uses</p>
<p>this fossil plant, the chemical analysis to understand</p>
<p>what was the climate back in</p>
<p>a thousand years, hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>And so something that incredibly</p>
<p>touched me by this book, it was narrated by the author.</p>
<p>Nice. And it&rsquo;s an incredibly</p>
<p>personal story, incredibly. So</p>
<p>certain parts of the book, you could actually hear the author crying.</p>
<p>And that to me, I mean, I never experienced</p>
<p>anything like this, reading the book, but it was like</p>
<p>the connection between you and the author.</p>
<p>And I think this is really</p>
<p>a must read, but even better, a must listen</p>
<p>to audio book for anyone who</p>
<p>wants to learn about sort of</p>
<p>academia, science, research in general, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very personal account about her becoming</p>
<p>a scientist. So</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just before New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about some difficult topics of viruses and so on.</p>
<p>Do you have some exciting things you&rsquo;re looking forward</p>
<p>to in 2021? Some New Year&rsquo;s resolutions,</p>
<p>maybe silly or fun, or</p>
<p>something very important and fundamental to</p>
<p>the world of science or something completely unimportant?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to</p>
<p>towards things becoming normal.</p>
<p>So yes, I really miss traveling.</p>
<p>Every summer I go</p>
<p>to an international summer school. It&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the School for Molecular and Theoretical Biology. It&rsquo;s held in Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s organized by very good friends of mine. And this is</p>
<p>the school for gifted kids from all over the world, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incredibly bright. It&rsquo;s like every time I go there, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a highlight of the year. And</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t make it this August, so we</p>
<p>did this school remotely, but it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So I am definitely looking forward to next August</p>
<p>coming there. One of</p>
<p>my personal resolutions, I realized that</p>
<p>being in the house and working from home,</p>
<p>I realized that actually</p>
<p>I apparently missed a lot</p>
<p>spending time with my family,</p>
<p>believe it or not. So you typically, with all the</p>
<p>research and teaching and</p>
<p>everything related to the academic life,</p>
<p>I mean, you get distracted. And so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel that</p>
<p>the fact that you are away from your family doesn&rsquo;t affect you</p>
<p>because you are naturally distracted by other things.</p>
<p>So this time I realized that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so important, right? Spending your time with</p>
<p>the family, with your kids. And so that</p>
<p>would be my new year resolution and actually trying to</p>
<p>spend as much time as possible. Even when the world opens up.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautiful message. That&rsquo;s a beautiful reminder.</p>
<p>I asked you if there&rsquo;s a Russian poem</p>
<p>that I could read, that I could force you to read, and you said, okay, fine, sure.</p>
<p>Do you mind reading?</p>
<p>And you said that no paper needed.</p>
<p>So this poem was written by my namesake,</p>
<p>another Dmitry, Dmitry Kemerefeld.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a recent poem and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Sorceress, Vyadma,</p>
<p>in Russian, or actually</p>
<p>Koldunya. So that&rsquo;s sort of another sort of connotation of</p>
<p>sorceress or witch. And I really like it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of just a handful poems I actually</p>
<p>can recall by heart. I also have a very strong</p>
<p>association when I read this poem with Master and</p>
<p>Margarita, the main female character,</p>
<p>Margarita. And also it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about, it&rsquo;s happening about the same time we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>now, so around New Year,</p>
<p>around Christmas. Do you mind reading it in Russian?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a try.</p>
<p>So you narrowed your eyes,</p>
<p>that anyone who was blessed</p>
<p>was ready to give their soul to the devil</p>
<p>for this witch&rsquo;s connection.</p>
<p>And I, without prejudice,</p>
<p>ran out to feel your</p>
<p>amazing breath on your lips,</p>
<p>to remember how you flew above the earth</p>
<p>in a white view,</p>
<p>in a white haze, in a white mist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful. I love how it captures a moment of longing</p>
<p>and maybe love even.</p>
<p>Yes. To me it has a lot of meaning about</p>
<p>this something that is happening,</p>
<p>something that is far away, but still very close to you.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s the winter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something magical about winter, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to translate it, but a kiss in winter</p>
<p>is interesting. Lips in winter and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful. Russian has a way. It has a reason, Russian poetry</p>
<p>is just, I&rsquo;m a fan of poetry in both languages, but English</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t capture some of the magic that Russian seems to, so</p>
<p>thank you for doing that. That was awesome. Dmitry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to talk to you again. It&rsquo;s contagious</p>
<p>how much you love what you do, how much you love life, so I really appreciate</p>
<p>you taking the time to talk today. And thank you for having me.</p>
