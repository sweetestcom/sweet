professional dota 2</p><p>caster / commentator was a former</p><p>professional player I am joined here by</p><p>Kyle who I guess Kyle you are a former</p><p>professional / current professional</p><p>player who is played at can I say</p><p>several several t is a little bit of a</p><p>stretch you have been at t eyes and you</p><p>will also be working as a commentator</p><p>for this year&rsquo;s international okay so</p><p>what we&rsquo;re going to be doing here today</p><p>is just going over the replays of the</p><p>games that I played against the open AI</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna specifically look at gaming</p><p>them number one and number three of</p><p>course I played the game but I have not</p><p>watch this replay yet Kyle you sort of</p><p>have an idea of what went down I assume</p><p>you read reddit so you know how this</p><p>kind of went down I did you all right so</p><p>on three two one zero will start the</p><p>replay okay three two one zero okay so</p><p>when the draft face started I guess</p><p>we&rsquo;ll give you our thoughts behind what</p><p>was good / bad we knew that Earthshaker</p><p>was probably gonna be very good just</p><p>because we felt like fog of war heroes</p><p>would be pretty disruptive to the AI and</p><p>we felt like echo slam was always gonna</p><p>be a somewhat useful ability I think the</p><p>issue here is that we thought that necro</p><p>was going to be really good mm-hmm so</p><p>the boss it kept picking Lich first</p><p>apparently it&rsquo;s priority was highest for</p><p>Lich like out of all the heroes in the</p><p>pool which was the hero that it had the</p><p>most successful</p><p>you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s just like the perfect hero</p><p>in a lot of ways got like all your</p><p>spell&rsquo;s are useful and theoretically</p><p>there&rsquo;s no carry in the game that can</p><p>deal more damage in like that black</p><p>window it went some it actually didn&rsquo;t</p><p>go BKB so then we to I grow and we</p><p>thought it was broken but it was bad</p><p>yeah Kyle well we understood that after</p><p>game wow yeah</p><p>it just lots of damage like both have</p><p>really and it ramps up I was like yeah</p><p>so what we understood to about the game</p><p>itself was that we did feel like our</p><p>shaker was pretty strong but we felt</p><p>like gyrocopter and talking to some</p><p>other pros after the game about it</p><p>we felt that gyro was probably the most</p><p>important hero in the pool like I know</p><p>that the bot prioritized which the</p><p>highest but I think gyro was up there</p><p>equal if not even more than that just</p><p>because I think that gyro it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>a killer and in this pool of heroes</p><p>there weren&rsquo;t a lot of killers because</p><p>gyro has solo kill potential on anybody</p><p>with homing missile right plus rocket</p><p>barrage whereas like if you look at the</p><p>heroes that are on the board right now</p><p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of heroes that just go</p><p>in and get kills but yeah they also I</p><p>think that they identified</p><p>because they abuse gyro death profit</p><p>like every game they would first to</p><p>those heroes whenever available yeah so</p><p>then we open up razor we thought that we</p><p>just needed hero that was somewhat</p><p>independent which you&rsquo;re gonna find by</p><p>the way it was like the worst idea of</p><p>all time just because of the way that</p><p>the Bob plays the meta and then we had</p><p>the last hero pick and if I remember</p><p>correctly here we took shadow fiend that</p><p>was indeed me that was indeed me okay so</p><p>the SF was actually great by the way in</p><p>game so it takes line and yeah so this</p><p>is the lineup we felt like our laning</p><p>phase was okay we just felt like our mid</p><p>game should be a lot stronger as well as</p><p>our teamfight should just be a lot</p><p>stronger fights they never really are</p><p>like I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna happen I</p><p>know they like quad Lane okay so we</p><p>smoked up that is like the one thing</p><p>that we knew we were gonna do we were</p><p>gonna smoke up try to find a fight</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t really sure what rune they were</p><p>gonna go to but we felt like maybe we</p><p>could just take like a decent level one</p><p>because we know that Lich is sacrifice</p><p>right and we do have a really strong</p><p>level one team with crystal maiden plus</p><p>or shaker</p><p>stats yeah oh if you notice they have</p><p>five couriers so since they have five</p><p>couriers I think the bot can&rsquo;t quite do</p><p>individual couriers yet so they&rsquo;ve got</p><p>five couriers and so they kind of</p><p>adapted to the meta in that regard</p><p>whereas we were playing sort of outdated</p><p>dota so they secure top rune so you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna find this is like the funny the</p><p>weirdest part about it is that they</p><p>start as like some weird Quadling</p><p>collective to begin the game and you</p><p>would think like that this should be so</p><p>Advent advantageous to us right the fact</p><p>that they start like they&rsquo;re leaning</p><p>like this and some weird configuration</p><p>like I essentially get a free mid lane</p><p>to start like a look at mid the sniper</p><p>but double shrapnel is on the ground I</p><p>was like sure why not I picked up a soul</p><p>pretty early on I kind of knew at that</p><p>point like the bot wasn&rsquo;t perfect when</p><p>it came to a mechanical skill like it</p><p>made errors and stuff like that but up</p><p>at top I don&rsquo;t know if you caught that</p><p>but they just do under the tower level</p><p>one to kill merlini yeah they just don&rsquo;t</p><p>form of the tower but like even the Lich</p><p>bot bottoms like the weird part too is</p><p>that they decide to aggro with two cores</p><p>which is not something we see very often</p><p>also they&rsquo;re fantastic it tonight that</p><p>is like the one mechanical skill thing</p><p>that was absurd apparently is that Ben</p><p>had a hard time just getting CS</p><p>but you&rsquo;ll notice in mid lane it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>that bad</p><p>for me whatsoever yeah like they do it</p><p>very well in terms of like how all three</p><p>heroes hit we also noticed by the way</p><p>that they didn&rsquo;t deal with the pole very</p><p>well I&rsquo;m watching top down so they just</p><p>shove up this Lane</p><p>but it&rsquo;s really hard to get players to</p><p>coordinate as well as they are because</p><p>they get the timing at the same frame</p><p>where it&rsquo;s like so they grab I mean they</p><p>grab just another kill they rotate down</p><p>the bottom you&rsquo;ll notice that the bot is</p><p>really good at this like it gets away</p><p>with a certain amount of HP every single</p><p>time then our team rotates the top to</p><p>try to get the kill onto the gyro I</p><p>think we&rsquo;re pretty unsuccessful here</p><p>actually cuz fogged Reddy uses Fischer</p><p>lots just gonna run around pop the self</p><p>like middling is great for me though at</p><p>this point 14 4 I find a regen rune atop</p><p>I&rsquo;m telling my team like my game at</p><p>least is very good to start also we</p><p>wanted to know how the bots would deal</p><p>with envious so I felt like shadow fiend</p><p>was just a good pick we are gonna pick</p><p>up shadow blade pretty early on I think</p><p>it it just realized like SF is our</p><p>shadow fiend is a threatened on the map</p><p>at all times cuz if he has if he doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>have boots and I have boots I simply</p><p>just walk up raise him twice and then he</p><p>dies that&rsquo;s like the benefit of playing</p><p>this matchup</p><p>something I should know - is that fogged</p><p>had a really hard time coming online for</p><p>game number one and two I think part of</p><p>it was just like he didn&rsquo;t really know</p><p>where to be because we couldn&rsquo;t really</p><p>kill anybody on the map so the game just</p><p>felt really difficult for him</p><p>so I tell you I would say you have a big</p><p>advantage yeah so you&rsquo;re gonna realize</p><p>that&rsquo;s the hard part about playing in</p><p>CAI is that it does a very good job of</p><p>knocking down the early tier ones and</p><p>then it takes way too much map control</p><p>in my opinion anyways what the fact that</p><p>they decide to move everybody down</p><p>bottom we actually saw that because they</p><p>did it under vision but they ran for the</p><p>bounty rune then they said the we</p><p>estimate the winning probability the</p><p>above 99% at that point our team was</p><p>like minor upset about that because it&rsquo;s</p><p>hard not to get tilted by that so Fogg</p><p>had a sick block there just continues to</p><p>block I think I get stunned here but my</p><p>team did a really good job of letting me</p><p>get the last hit</p><p>they put the sniper so this is something</p><p>you just never see in dota where they</p><p>just do the the three lane swap like you</p><p>will never see a mid just rotate to the</p><p>offlane like this but this is really</p><p>cool and very effective because razor is</p><p>not suited to lane against a sniper</p><p>especially in these thus far behind ya</p><p>so that&rsquo;s kind of what I thought too</p><p>like I went to bottom by the way they</p><p>had the most random century of all time</p><p>down here which kind of just made my</p><p>Ganga tim knoll they had two centuries</p><p>on the guy yeah I do run out of vision</p><p>and fog lines a nice fissure to stop</p><p>that but it just felt like where</p><p>whatever kind of rotation we were making</p><p>felt really useless and whatever</p><p>rotation they were making felt like it</p><p>was just doing too much yeah I I think</p><p>yeah so something I noticed here by the</p><p>way too that I really want to point out</p><p>now that we&rsquo;re watching the game or</p><p>whatever is that their decision to send</p><p>the sniper to the offlane so snipers</p><p>probably the most vulnerable hero and</p><p>typically you would think that sending</p><p>them to the offlane or Delaine which is</p><p>the longest for him is really unsafe but</p><p>just the way that dota is played</p><p>nowadays we&rsquo;re largely avoiding playing</p><p>the safe lane and so it should know</p><p>where it knows that it&rsquo;s the safest</p><p>place for it to be so fog line is a</p><p>really nice fissure I get the double</p><p>rays off but they do a really good job</p><p>of crowd controlling me we brought</p><p>everyone down here for this fight but I</p><p>think they were just so much faster</p><p>reacting</p><p>yeah I thought it was okay yeah so they</p><p>brought four heroes down here they send</p><p>their death prophet to the offlane and</p><p>she just pops this is the tower yeah so</p><p>I would argue this now it&rsquo;s now it&rsquo;s</p><p>really rough because their collapse on</p><p>this mid tower next it&rsquo;s really cool to</p><p>notice the Lich Max&rsquo;s sacrifice so</p><p>they&rsquo;re just abusing their the XP</p><p>advantages because you gain experience</p><p>when you die creeps so this gets their</p><p>very level dependent cores and supports</p><p>really like everyone just gets ahead</p><p>thanks to this</p><p>what&rsquo;s XP XP they&rsquo;re up by a little bit</p><p>more than 2000 so mid they catch fogged</p><p>good envision the line was really</p><p>patient he goes down and the top moon</p><p>meanders gonna get gone on it&rsquo;s</p><p>absolutely no way for him to survive</p><p>this and we didn&rsquo;t really know that they</p><p>were gonna go at the top and mid at the</p><p>same time like the thing about dota is</p><p>that whenever you represents just like</p><p>two or three heroes you want to try to</p><p>take the fight where they&rsquo;ve got the</p><p>least amount of people but it felt like</p><p>they were just so close at finding each</p><p>other and grouping up yeah they actually</p><p>completely sandwiched us that was</p><p>actually incredible I didn&rsquo;t even know</p><p>that they played it like that we we</p><p>talked about how especially in</p><p>competitive dota you want to try to</p><p>defend that&rsquo;s your one tower especially</p><p>the mid one can&rsquo;t roll so much of your</p><p>jungle but we just we just couldn&rsquo;t we</p><p>just weren&rsquo;t fast enough and you notice</p><p>that as soon as I go bottom the Lich is</p><p>already there to meet me and the sad</p><p>thing is I just can&rsquo;t do anything about</p><p>it so they rotate more heroes down here</p><p>they&rsquo;re gonna collapse on me they</p><p>actually missed the dust but I thought</p><p>they hit it and so it pops me out of</p><p>inves all my heroes are down here we</p><p>were expecting this and we were trying</p><p>to get the bait off and we just couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>and you&rsquo;ll notice that the bots always</p><p>feels like it&rsquo;s in position</p><p>sniper doesn&rsquo;t even die</p><p>Oh this was brutal it just feels like</p><p>they&rsquo;re getting the right amount of</p><p>Heroes out for all these engagements</p><p>well I feel like at this point the game</p><p>like it&rsquo;s like the hero lineups where</p><p>you don&rsquo;t really have a core that can</p><p>make plays on the map for you</p><p>razor has no game whatsoever and same</p><p>with net girl like these guys need to be</p><p>ahead really function yeah all in on the</p><p>idea the shadow team&rsquo;s shadow base it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna like take over the game but they</p><p>can just run around in circles than any</p><p>combination of two heroes is gonna find</p><p>kills and they can just stay on that</p><p>they have so much self-sustained there&rsquo;s</p><p>funneling salves back in like the DP</p><p>couriers like a mango a raindrop of</p><p>clarity in a south</p><p>so they just continue to die I guess</p><p>what I wanted to ask you about was did</p><p>you feel like we just played this very</p><p>badly</p><p>was there any like stupid obvious things</p><p>that we had messed up on low level</p><p>mistakes but I remember playing back</p><p>with tall fly yeah and we always like</p><p>the easiest way to lose games is to try</p><p>and defend tier ones with fewer numbers</p><p>than your opponents then you have an</p><p>extra guy TP n but like you still can&rsquo;t</p><p>turn the fight so now you like lose</p><p>three players you lose the tower for</p><p>sure and like your TV&rsquo;s our cooldown</p><p>like you just kind of throw away the</p><p>game so it&rsquo;s off to like almost always</p><p>better if you can&rsquo;t bring it if you</p><p>can&rsquo;t be sure you&rsquo;re gonna win a fight</p><p>at a Tier one you just leave a hero to</p><p>pull creeps like I would say any core</p><p>the razor cm of probably ideal just</p><p>because you can angrily waves and the</p><p>backup shaker behind and you forced then</p><p>four heroes to try and make a dive maybe</p><p>it&rsquo;ll succeed they&rsquo;ll kill a core but</p><p>you don&rsquo;t lose the tower and like three</p><p>more heroes and you&rsquo;re in your side</p><p>lanes your mid lane like your other</p><p>heroes are not accelerating but when you</p><p>commit to a lane and then who&rsquo;s the</p><p>fighter</p><p>yeah so there&rsquo;s a good point for me to</p><p>make there about that I think part of it</p><p>you said and people should really</p><p>realize like dota has a lot to do with</p><p>just like how human behavior works is</p><p>like we felt like we could do exactly</p><p>what you said which is would have for</p><p>three or four years down there one guy</p><p>could continue to play greedy which was</p><p>me and we would just out greet them</p><p>collect the pressure shoves up the lane</p><p>while lion is pushing on middle now I</p><p>think this concept of like giving a core</p><p>like licha solo Lane and like support</p><p>gets ahead he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll be able to like</p><p>rotate lanes and have a massive impact</p><p>and it&rsquo;s far easier for cores to catch</p><p>up into a game than a support because</p><p>they&rsquo;re able to like sit in the lane</p><p>take CS the supports if you&rsquo;re behind</p><p>and you&rsquo;re forced to move around the map</p><p>like you end up just being lost with no</p><p>game sort of like we saw happened fogged</p><p>in this game where he&rsquo;s just like level</p><p>2 level 3 and then that decisive fight</p><p>that happened in the tier 1 guys he was</p><p>just recovering mid cuz he&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m a</p><p>level 3 Earthshaker this is miserable</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna just try and get something</p><p>here yeah so what you&rsquo;re saying</p><p>essentially is they sacrifice the early</p><p>part of the their core sacrificed the</p><p>early part of the game so that everyone</p><p>could have a good game collectively yeah</p><p>yeah partly because</p><p>in addition like it&rsquo;s just for the</p><p>mental aspect of it right these rockets</p><p>like come out very very fast pause the</p><p>game here yeah okay so there&rsquo;s two</p><p>things that I want to talk about here is</p><p>I think that I think it&rsquo;d be really easy</p><p>for me to say that we got mechanically</p><p>out skilled which might be true to a</p><p>certain extent but I didn&rsquo;t think here</p><p>was the reason we lost like I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>think that it was so there was gonna be</p><p>one instance that you see of the hex on</p><p>a fogged but even he said I think that</p><p>he messed up in that instance but it</p><p>never felt like we were because I saw a</p><p>lot of people talk about how we were</p><p>just mechanically out skilled from the</p><p>get-go but I think it&rsquo;s we should just</p><p>like nip that in the bud and say that we</p><p>probably just got out strategy yeah I</p><p>think they just executed a game plan so</p><p>there&rsquo;s always a there&rsquo;s always just</p><p>like saying that</p><p>kuroh has croaky the captain of liquid</p><p>that I really fell in love with he said</p><p>that somebody&rsquo;s game has to be bad so</p><p>that somebody else&rsquo;s game can be good</p><p>like you have to part of most of dota is</p><p>that one person will sacrifice their</p><p>success so that everybody else can</p><p>succeed oftentimes that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>either their carry player Mitama men is</p><p>going to have a really rough game but by</p><p>him having a rough game every other</p><p>player on liquid has a very good game</p><p>whereas I think in this game part of it</p><p>is that none of us wanted to look bad</p><p>because of the circumstances we</p><p>obviously want to all wanted to play</p><p>well individually because like we&rsquo;re I</p><p>mean this is a weird high stakes game</p><p>right we still want to show up and play</p><p>and so I think especially for myself if</p><p>I&rsquo;m just admitting it like I was focused</p><p>too much on like how well I was doing</p><p>like as long as I was getting a good</p><p>game I felt like I was gonna be able to</p><p>carry and you&rsquo;ll notice that I am the</p><p>highest love</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got the highest net worth like my</p><p>game went excellently and it did not</p><p>matter even in the least yeah I think</p><p>everybody&rsquo;s like had a massive impact in</p><p>this game yes I think the Lich following</p><p>SF from lane to Lane is very interesting</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to sit in the lane yeah</p><p>by default and you also can&rsquo;t pressure</p><p>tower could be skilled armor at level 4</p><p>so you just you just sad the only way to</p><p>really respond to that would be to like</p><p>set up moves on the Lich but this</p><p>strategy is something I don&rsquo;t think any</p><p>of you have ever encountered in the</p><p>combined like 30,000 games probably</p><p>played yeah so that that&rsquo;s something I</p><p>realized too is that it felt really</p><p>weird when I was playing it in game it</p><p>felt like for whatever reason and</p><p>obviously I know this now watching this</p><p>game but it feels like in game that no</p><p>matter what moved that I would normally</p><p>make that would likely pay off just</p><p>didn&rsquo;t it was like I would go to one</p><p>tower I&rsquo;d go top I&rsquo;d pressure out the</p><p>lane and then there would just be a lich</p><p>there and I couldn&rsquo;t dive him I just not</p><p>really scared at all times whereas most</p><p>human players were just kind of a band</p><p>in that area yeah and the rest of the</p><p>team would farm and someone would get</p><p>picked off that leads to a really cool</p><p>point like dota</p><p>I think movement is something that&rsquo;s</p><p>under aided by like the layman as to its</p><p>importance on a game and it&rsquo;s very hard</p><p>to understand or explain because it&rsquo;s</p><p>like a dance or if you miss one step</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna miss the next four so just</p><p>the minutiae of what they&rsquo;re doing like</p><p>who&rsquo;s rotating to what lane when they</p><p>teleport like how they rotate across the</p><p>map it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very smart and that&rsquo;s um</p><p>there&rsquo;s a Eevee like expected value is</p><p>like a poker term that a lot of people</p><p>use their movements are very very strong</p><p>I think the mid dive is a perfect</p><p>example where they get to kill top and</p><p>then they&rsquo;re collapsing mid as five and</p><p>the worst-case scenario for them is</p><p>they&rsquo;re gonna collect a support and take</p><p>out the most crucial of your towers by</p><p>like before ten minutes</p><p>and that&rsquo;s something that requires like</p><p>a lot more coordination then people</p><p>would think because it&rsquo;s very</p><p>commonplace for as you&rsquo;re saying you</p><p>know someone might just want to push top</p><p>you&rsquo;ll never see people like leave free</p><p>lanes at times and pubs specifically</p><p>because it feels bad you want to just</p><p>keep accelerating get yourself further</p><p>ahead in the game and part of why dota</p><p>at its core is a very captain and</p><p>leadership based game is because you</p><p>need to have one plan that five people</p><p>are executing if you&rsquo;re going to be the</p><p>best I think if you look at the top</p><p>teams that we have they all like kuroky</p><p>is a great example of an incredibly</p><p>strong captain his team execute a game</p><p>plan and then they thrive yeah I think</p><p>part of the problem here is okay so</p><p>there is one moment in this game where I</p><p>felt like man no human player would be</p><p>able to make that play if I&rsquo;m just</p><p>honest like the hex on the fog but it</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t have come to this point where</p><p>we&rsquo;re down 6000 gold at 18 minutes to</p><p>begin with I don&rsquo;t know I this this game</p><p>felt really weird because normally if</p><p>I&rsquo;m playing a hero like shadow fiend I</p><p>can use my two nukes I can double raise</p><p>the wave out I can put pressure on a</p><p>tower then what&rsquo;ll end up happening is</p><p>that people that&rsquo;s what allows that&rsquo;s</p><p>what forces people to split up like</p><p>people don&rsquo;t really understand this but</p><p>when you push in waves what it does is</p><p>you get it closer that&rsquo;s our somebody</p><p>responds by teleporting up there and</p><p>then it just opens up the other four</p><p>heroes on the map because they&rsquo;re not</p><p>coordinated anymore they it slows down</p><p>the game plan it makes it so that</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s like well what now one guy</p><p>left because you&rsquo;re not gonna send four</p><p>heroes up there you&rsquo;re just gonna send</p><p>one guy and then everyone on the map</p><p>should be susceptible to getting killed</p><p>there should be some sort of pressure</p><p>being laid out on the map but I felt</p><p>like that the AI was just really good at</p><p>grouping up they would send one hero it</p><p>was almost always the Lich to slow me</p><p>down then he as soon as I was gone</p><p>because eventually I&rsquo;m not just gonna</p><p>stand up there he would just leave join</p><p>up for the rest of his team and they</p><p>would just continue to put pressure on</p><p>our towers yeah I think the part of this</p><p>game if you&rsquo;re gonna review this for</p><p>like a competitive standpoint like what</p><p>did we do wrong it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all about the</p><p>tier ones I think the death</p><p>profit-taking the tier one top for free</p><p>while losing three heroes and Tier one</p><p>bottom then you get sandwiched me</p><p>like at that point there isn&rsquo;t really</p><p>much for you to do you&rsquo;re relying on the</p><p>enemies to make mistakes to win the game</p><p>but they&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat and</p><p>that&rsquo;s something uh it&rsquo;s very important</p><p>in dota is tempo control and they have</p><p>the ability to make moves and thanks to</p><p>their draft like they have so much draw</p><p>damage</p><p>there&rsquo;s no save for any of your heroes</p><p>like if someone gets stunned or hexed</p><p>even just jewels in the face like you</p><p>have rocket chases you like you actually</p><p>just die</p><p>all five of their heroes can set up</p><p>kills and the rest of the team is very</p><p>adapted just following up and ensuring</p><p>that they landed and they&rsquo;re always on</p><p>map which is something that I think is a</p><p>distinct advantage they have over you</p><p>where they&rsquo;re just doing much better</p><p>with courier usage and highly</p><p>prioritizing regen do you want to</p><p>continue I don&rsquo;t know how much more of</p><p>this game is honestly useful to watch at</p><p>this point it just comes out of the fact</p><p>that we couldn&rsquo;t hold high ground they</p><p>were just a little bit too far ahead and</p><p>then we get double racks in the game is</p><p>just sort of over probably just skip</p><p>ahead to game number three sure okay</p><p>okay what was really funny is after game</p><p>one that happened we were just like they</p><p>were they were like okay you get to</p><p>draft your heroes and then we just were</p><p>like somehow we came to the exact</p><p>conclusion that we should just steal the</p><p>bots lineup okay</p><p>that we just came like every time like</p><p>hero after here and we&rsquo;re like guys Lich</p><p>looks like a really good hero let&rsquo;s play</p><p>it then it was like wait you know what</p><p>gyro seemed really opie and then we just</p><p>kept stealing the lineup and then we</p><p>last picked necro because they had three</p><p>four melee heroes and an axe in his</p><p>friend so it just seemed like a really</p><p>free necro game yeah III think the gyro</p><p>one thing I would say are we are you</p><p>watching the game at all</p><p>are we just talking about this but I&rsquo;m</p><p>not sure I recovery is back for that</p><p>reason I think we&rsquo;ll see it at TI and</p><p>this game kind of demonstrates why cuz</p><p>it&rsquo;s just so easy to play around it it</p><p>feels like the hero is never really</p><p>doing something wrong if you show up in</p><p>a lane to try and find a kill you&rsquo;re</p><p>probably best you&rsquo;re great at that if</p><p>you want a flash farm or take stacks you</p><p>can do that like you&rsquo;ve so many options</p><p>and part of what makes notice of</p><p>difficult and complex is that at every</p><p>facet of the game there are so many</p><p>options</p><p>decisions that you could be making uh</p><p>you could be stacking you can be farming</p><p>you can be setting up a gank you could</p><p>be positioning defensively yada yada</p><p>yada and you&rsquo;re all it&rsquo;s not just your</p><p>enemies that are important it&rsquo;s your own</p><p>teammates what are they doing how are</p><p>they playing the game and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>just so hard to do all these things</p><p>correctly I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m watching the</p><p>start of this game there quad laning</p><p>bottom and like interesting yeah okay so</p><p>we figured that this actually didn&rsquo;t</p><p>work because they were missing a crucial</p><p>element that they had in the previous</p><p>games that we now had which was just the</p><p>ability to kill people</p><p>yeah like the gyrocopter and all this</p><p>stuff made it just so easy to get kills</p><p>and I think that&rsquo;s like a really good</p><p>point that&rsquo;s the issue with the razor</p><p>necro where once they&rsquo;re behind they</p><p>have no method of gaining of getting</p><p>kills so their only option is to try and</p><p>recover and farm the map and when the</p><p>enemy team is ahead and more adept at</p><p>finding kills like you just end up</p><p>feeding at some point that&rsquo;s what</p><p>happened I also think you played this a</p><p>much better where you didn&rsquo;t just</p><p>abandon lanes you keep someone mid at</p><p>all times it&rsquo;s your net grow you don&rsquo;t</p><p>feed at this like initial dive you just</p><p>pull the creeps away it&rsquo;s no big deal</p><p>that one death under Tower I think of</p><p>the lion like that&rsquo;s good for you guys</p><p>in the grand scheme of things because he</p><p>got a full XP off the wave and it takes</p><p>so much resources for them to so many</p><p>resources for them to complete that die</p><p>yeah I&rsquo;m at 3:40 in game but what we</p><p>realized I was pretty interesting about</p><p>this game too is that they killed moon</p><p>and they just kept killing him like they</p><p>did everything in their power to ruin</p><p>his game more or less then they went for</p><p>this dive at Tom at 4 minutes and they</p><p>actually got more kills than I feel like</p><p>they should have what the type of lineup</p><p>that they had like the score right now</p><p>is 4 to 7 despite them having the most</p><p>garbage lineup I&rsquo;ve ever seen in dota 2</p><p>yeah</p><p>it&rsquo;s like damage cheap these are nice to</p><p>me trying to see like what their IM</p><p>decisions are they don&rsquo;t make sense they</p><p>prioritize boots on like all their</p><p>heroes which is interesting like first</p><p>item on the Clark Sven and axe after</p><p>their initial no ability to move around</p><p>map yeah although this is much as</p><p>simpler if you have resources at all</p><p>times thanks to a free courier like just</p><p>funneling you regen yeah it&rsquo;s an easier</p><p>decision to make yeah that was the one</p><p>that was the one knock on the body felt</p><p>is that the reagent game felts a little</p><p>bit different it did change I did feel</p><p>like it changed them at a more than it</p><p>yeah I still feel like if I&rsquo;m being dead</p><p>honest like it&rsquo;s easy for me to say that</p><p>but we did just get out moved her on the</p><p>map the first game you guys like I it</p><p>was just really bad the first eight</p><p>minutes like you lost the game it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you recovered like</p><p>learn from it because at that point like</p><p>they really did have a 99% chance of</p><p>winning the game yeah especially</p><p>considering that they weren&rsquo;t gonna make</p><p>like those critical errors because they</p><p>know how to close a game but that&rsquo;s what</p><p>separates good from great teams and what</p><p>you&rsquo;ll see at this ti we&rsquo;re like the</p><p>liquids if you give them the advantage</p><p>that the human team did in that first</p><p>game like that&rsquo;s it like they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>collect that and they&rsquo;re gonna take a</p><p>free win dota is very much like an easy</p><p>game to finish when you&rsquo;re in a position</p><p>like to win it&rsquo;s sort of like just not</p><p>crashing on the last lap when you&rsquo;ve got</p><p>you know the quarter-mile lead at the</p><p>last leg at Daytona like you just have</p><p>to not crash and they do not yeah what</p><p>are these wards they double warded by</p><p>accident in this bottom lane yeah so</p><p>they they sort of learn from that in</p><p>game the spent suicides to kill the tier</p><p>two later on but you&rsquo;ll notice in this</p><p>game especially like with how easy mid</p><p>was because they just didn&rsquo;t send</p><p>anybody MIT this time around they didn&rsquo;t</p><p>have their what I noticed that was</p><p>really different is because they don&rsquo;t</p><p>have the Lich to just sit there and</p><p>defend the tower they don&rsquo;t have</p><p>something that just pulls it back in and</p><p>plays defense</p><p>so no one really wanted to be there on</p><p>their team yeah and look now you can</p><p>just do exactly what they didn&rsquo;t game on</p><p>you&rsquo;re just here with three chords that</p><p>are incredibly strong lion runs up like</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing there&rsquo;s nothing you can</p><p>really do here at team bot</p><p>test this power push yeah that&rsquo;s uh we</p><p>just essentially sold their strategy and</p><p>we sent our own list on the bottom but</p><p>they just dome</p><p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter at this</p><p>point I felt like this game was like</p><p>much easier to play yeah</p><p>and I see two heroes up at top I think I</p><p>was the one that teleported here if I</p><p>remember correctly which I was don&rsquo;t a</p><p>memory still good because I felt I just</p><p>felt like I was unkillable in this game</p><p>like it was my job to be the one to be</p><p>up here to defend this tower yeah I</p><p>would agree you you&rsquo;re the one that</p><p>wants to be douve and then it&rsquo;s so easy</p><p>for your team to play around yeah and</p><p>that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening right</p><p>now you&rsquo;ll see fog comes in completely</p><p>whoops the stun but it doesn&rsquo;t really</p><p>matter and that that&rsquo;s what I would have</p><p>liked to see in Game one but it&rsquo;s much</p><p>more difficult this game it&rsquo;s as Fenton</p><p>acts in a recap in&rsquo; if the gank is</p><p>played out accordingly where you bait</p><p>the hero that&rsquo;s strongest he just kills</p><p>time kills time his supports can come in</p><p>and now you&rsquo;ve just completely</p><p>overextended on the open AI team and</p><p>suddenly you&rsquo;re in trouble and in the</p><p>meantime you were farming to Lane style</p><p>push that bottom D be pushed out mid</p><p>he&rsquo;s recovering final point on the first</p><p>game is something else we want to bring</p><p>up was the sniper going top brilliant I</p><p>think that&rsquo;s something else we might see</p><p>more in the future is that if the mid</p><p>gets this big advantage and you have</p><p>some hero you can just plant there a la</p><p>a Lynch you just send them to go up</p><p>against the opposing carry you have a</p><p>hero advantage a two-level advantage and</p><p>it&rsquo;s so hard like you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to play in your safe Lane as you</p><p>turn into the mid game in DotA you want</p><p>to be able to play around the enemy</p><p>jungle because it gives you the ability</p><p>to threaten two lanes and to remove the</p><p>enemy woods as an area for them to</p><p>acquire resources and advantage so how</p><p>do you contest this sniper when you have</p><p>a razor in your safe lane like it&rsquo;s</p><p>really not possible you could kill him</p><p>by bringing three four heroes there but</p><p>now what like what does that accomplish</p><p>yeah because you&rsquo;re not getting</p><p>the objective alpha that it&rsquo;s not easy</p><p>to take that tower right after yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>a really good point</p><p>okay so relieving pressure you&rsquo;re not</p><p>actually applying any yes just playing</p><p>catch-up essentially the other team is</p><p>still now in control of the tempo</p><p>leading the dance and you&rsquo;re just</p><p>responding that&rsquo;s never really want to</p><p>be in DotA it&rsquo;s very important how many</p><p>so you notice in this game too they&rsquo;re</p><p>still making similar moves like they</p><p>brought two core heroes made in fact I&rsquo;d</p><p>say I don&rsquo;t even know who qualifies is</p><p>what in this kind of game but they bring</p><p>a bunch of heroes here they take the mid</p><p>tower like they&rsquo;re still doing in my</p><p>opinion that actually I wouldn&rsquo;t go yeah</p><p>with their lineup is kind of it was kind</p><p>of sad for a bit if this is this is like</p><p>two teams of human is a dire line I was</p><p>running down mid like y&rsquo;all ready well I</p><p>got from the draft and nobody really</p><p>wants to play this so the fact that it</p><p>is as close as it is is something I want</p><p>to point out so what the bot did let&rsquo;s</p><p>say like let&rsquo;s skip to what&rsquo;s like a</p><p>good time to skip okay so if you come</p><p>down to about 15 minutes and 50 seconds</p><p>in game 15 50 or I meant 1551 I guess</p><p>all right I&rsquo;m at 15 53 okay let me just</p><p>catch up to your fuss okay three two one</p><p>zero</p><p>okay so you&rsquo;ll notice that the slark is</p><p>just kind of wasting time at bottom so</p><p>what they&rsquo;re doing right here is a</p><p>concept that I think everyone should</p><p>have pretty good approximate knowledge</p><p>of is that it&rsquo;s just trying to keep the</p><p>creep waves pushed in at all times like</p><p>you&rsquo;ll notice that the same time the</p><p>spin is pushing out top so we sent three</p><p>heroes down to deal with bottom they</p><p>send one hero down to push in mid and</p><p>they send this vent here up to pressure</p><p>top and what they&rsquo;re doing essentially</p><p>is they&rsquo;re just giving themselves more</p><p>opportunities you have a radiance I do</p><p>I mean thing this item was GG once I</p><p>caught it it was it&rsquo;s a great item it&rsquo;s</p><p>just I&rsquo;m just the timing I mean I had a</p><p>free lane nobody came to my lane like</p><p>but yeah what they&rsquo;re doing is all times</p><p>like you notice the bottom the axe</p><p>immediately goes to the creep skip yeah</p><p>I admit they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re always applying</p><p>pressure to all three lanes at once</p><p>which is probably what we should have</p><p>been doing in the game that we were</p><p>behind but they just they do it pretty</p><p>effortlessly and I guess the reason why</p><p>I want to highlight this or why it&rsquo;s</p><p>important is that what it does is it</p><p>just gives you more opportunities on the</p><p>map at all times because if you think</p><p>about it eventually we will slip up and</p><p>we&rsquo;ll send the wrong hero to the wrong</p><p>place and if they get one kill then</p><p>suddenly it feels like the game is reset</p><p>not to mention if you die shoving the</p><p>lane like we&rsquo;ve seen it&rsquo;s not that much</p><p>of a punish because you&rsquo;ve already</p><p>seconds ahead in that Lane now because</p><p>their wave is dead and yours is alive</p><p>and yeah walking towards the enemy so</p><p>even though they find that kill they</p><p>have to now catch the creep wave like</p><p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a creep wave ahead so</p><p>you&rsquo;re buying time especially if there&rsquo;s</p><p>multiple heroes in the lane like you&rsquo;re</p><p>just you&rsquo;re not actually losing anything</p><p>it&rsquo;s something a VP I would say does the</p><p>best in the world at the moment they&rsquo;re</p><p>always playing three lanes and it allows</p><p>them to then connect with their heroes</p><p>to find kills or in the event you die</p><p>you just immediately swarm the other</p><p>ends of the map because you&rsquo;ve forced</p><p>enemies into an area that is now dead</p><p>yeah so you&rsquo;ll notice that this is</p><p>happening again where the slark yes he</p><p>died but we call this like a net neutral</p><p>death because it doesn&rsquo;t really do</p><p>anything like we we don&rsquo;t really care</p><p>they don&rsquo;t really care that he died</p><p>because he&rsquo;s just gonna go bottom and do</p><p>the same thing and what he&rsquo;s doing is</p><p>he&rsquo;s opening up the rest of the map for</p><p>his team so either what you&rsquo;re doing is</p><p>you&rsquo;re forcing them into a decision</p><p>which is either we come back and</p><p>somebody goes to defend this or they</p><p>make a move on the other side of the map</p><p>so we sent moon me under here because we</p><p>just need one defensive hero here mid</p><p>the queen of pain is being aggressive</p><p>and then what they want to do is create</p><p>some sort of movement on the map try to</p><p>catch somebody right and they&rsquo;re just</p><p>gonna keep shuttling heroes around until</p><p>they find somebody to kill that&rsquo;s nice</p><p>it looks simple but it&rsquo;s really good</p><p>complicated movements like I&rsquo;ve tried to</p><p>teach this to people many times in my</p><p>career it&rsquo;s quite difficult yeah this</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t die here but like as you can</p><p>see like look at all the time wasted</p><p>spells use three heroes the creepwave</p><p>dead look at what his team is able to do</p><p>yeah axe is like aggressively farming</p><p>enemy jungle he can cut next creep wave</p><p>mid wave is just marching down and this</p><p>is something like you don&rsquo;t see inferior</p><p>teams do where even though two heroes</p><p>are dead on the map instead of</p><p>retreating and just sort of giving the</p><p>map away they still just try and output</p><p>pressure and remove the time of the</p><p>having dead allies yeah so you noticed</p><p>by the way that you were completely</p><p>right like that is what the accident</p><p>because that&rsquo;s just a good plate he cuts</p><p>the wave then he just farms our jungle</p><p>so fog notices him obviously because we</p><p>have a ward here and I think we do get</p><p>the kill on him if I remember I reap</p><p>recite them everybody I reap or save the</p><p>queen of pain somebody gets reversed</p><p>it&rsquo;s on cooldown she&rsquo;s kidding yeah</p><p>and the spend they&rsquo;re behind now</p><p>so these plays are cool they are playing</p><p>the map really nicely but the issue is</p><p>that now you guys are the terminators</p><p>and playing like you&rsquo;re just all over</p><p>the place they can&rsquo;t actually find kills</p><p>on you partly due to their heroes being</p><p>inferior but also because now you&rsquo;re so</p><p>far ahead they can&rsquo;t ever kill necro and</p><p>necro is going to kill everyone if they</p><p>try and battle him yeah I mean at this</p><p>point the game even twenty minutes in</p><p>it&rsquo;s over I just thought the cool part</p><p>was that they&rsquo;re doing something to</p><p>expand like the possibility of winning I</p><p>guess like they&rsquo;re still trying to make</p><p>game-winning plays I mean I think this</p><p>game is hopeless just from the lineup if</p><p>I&rsquo;m just honest but it was cool that</p><p>they still try to make plays around the</p><p>map to get something done yeah I</p><p>actually think they&rsquo;re playing to win</p><p>like this is this is a winnable game if</p><p>their hero composition is just slightly</p><p>better and there&rsquo;s a glitch I think you</p><p>guys are in trouble yeah so moon I think</p><p>actually picks up a double kill here if</p><p>I remember correctly yeah but I mean at</p><p>this point there&rsquo;s not much else to talk</p><p>about I think like the game just repeats</p><p>in this fashion but I thought they did a</p><p>pretty good job of just giving</p><p>themselves more options which I think</p><p>more teams or more players should try to</p><p>do it&rsquo;s like I think a lot of people are</p><p>obsessed with the concept that</p><p>potentially dying but you just sort of</p><p>had to take these risks when you&rsquo;re this</p><p>far behind I I&rsquo;m happy because I think</p><p>the bots are utilizing two concepts that</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always sworn by and also had like a</p><p>lot of resistance to which is notably</p><p>one you want to try and ensure every</p><p>player on your team has a game I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think this idea of having a like a</p><p>worthless 5 position that&rsquo;s really a 6</p><p>is what you want in the current meta</p><p>just because of the way items function</p><p>and how strong experience is on nearly</p><p>every hero in DotA thanks to talents um</p><p>and in addition they really heavily</p><p>prioritize what I would call like mid</p><p>game carries that don&rsquo;t need a lot of</p><p>time to come online they&rsquo;re always</p><p>strong throughout the game and while</p><p>they might fall off and like a 6 odd</p><p>verse 6 thought against other heroes</p><p>like their if they&rsquo;re ahead they stay</p><p>ahead and they can maintain an advantage</p><p>so it just feels suffocating they really</p><p>just tighten the vice and inevitably it</p><p>feels like they&rsquo;re going to win the game</p><p>like in the first game again the game is</p><p>over at 8 minutes from then on out it&rsquo;s</p><p>just following the script and I think</p><p>that that&rsquo;s the ideal way to be playing</p><p>good dota it&rsquo;s just obviously very</p><p>difficult when you&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>coordinate with five other players and</p><p>the 5 couriers do give you a big</p><p>advantage too because you could always</p><p>stay on map which is an even further big</p><p>advantage to heroes that are already</p><p>stronger on map than their opponents</p><p>yeah that was a mouthful but yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s like oh I like that that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would say is it coolest okay so again</p><p>this is blitz here with Kyle thank you</p><p>for joining me in reviewing game number</p><p>one and three and I think that&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>do for us</p><p>yeah thanks for having me on I</p><p>appreciate it I&rsquo;m sure it was</p><p>interesting yeah you guys you know what</p><p>do you guys were missing what you needed</p><p>a captain a five player yeah who&rsquo;s</p><p>fallen from grace need to reclaim some</p><p>glory to pick up the banner and uh yeah</p><p>next time next time next we learned a</p><p>lot this 100% the boss will have time to</p><p>Train and I&rsquo;m sure at some point you&rsquo;ll</p><p>end up back in San Francisco and I think</p><p>that you have a much better shot this</p><p>time</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a
