    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>Over the last few episodes, we&rsquo;ve focused on the oldest known ancestor of English, the</p>
<p>ancient Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And in the last episode, I look at the evidence to determine when and where these ancient</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans lived.</p>
<p>Now I want to try to put all the pieces together to explore the emergence of the ancient Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>and the spread of their language and culture throughout Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>In other words, how do we get from the Indo-European homeland in the Eurasian steppes to the various</p>
<p>places where the Indo-European languages ended up?</p>
<p>So this is the story of the Indo-European migrations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to begin by looking at the emergence of these people in the Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to explore the advantages they had, which allowed them to migrate over</p>
<p>thousands of miles, carrying their language with them.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to begin to look at the actual migrations of the people from the Eurasian</p>
<p>steppes to the places where the various Indo-European languages emerged.</p>
<p>So this episode will be heavy on history and light on language.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an extremely important and interesting step in the overall story of English.</p>
<p>In the last episode, I presented the evidence that has led most linguists and historians</p>
<p>to conclude that the ancient Indo-European speaking people lived in the region north</p>
<p>of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in Eastern Europe, in part of the region known as the</p>
<p>Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>The evidence also suggests that these people lived there between 4500 BC and 2500 BC.</p>
<p>This time frame coincides with the emergence of the earliest human civilizations further</p>
<p>south in Mesopotamia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>And based upon the research of archaeologists who&rsquo;ve conducted research in this region,</p>
<p>many scholars now believe that these first Indo-Europeans were herders associated with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been called the Yamnaya Horizon.</p>
<p>These Yamnaya herders were the first people of the steppes to create a herding economy.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin by exploring the evidence that indicates how this culture developed.</p>
<p>I should begin by noting that there is no consensus as to the exact time, order, or</p>
<p>sequence of these events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relying upon many sources for the discussion in this episode, but I want to once again</p>
<p>give a specific plug to David Anthony&rsquo;s excellent book, The Horse, the Wheel, and</p>
<p>Language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good starting point if you&rsquo;re interested in the archaeological evidence</p>
<p>surrounding the emergence and migration of the early Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>So be sure to check out his book if you want to learn more about this topic.</p>
<p>Now many historians of antiquity loved to begin human history at around 10,000 BC.</p>
<p>This may be partly because they like big round numbers, but it also happens to coincide</p>
<p>with the end of the last Ice Age.</p>
<p>So it marks the emergence of the world as we know it today.</p>
<p>As the ice sheets melted, the oceans rose, and the land bridge from continental Europe</p>
<p>to the British Isles began to disappear, and the British Isles actually became islands.</p>
<p>The land bridge also began to disappear between modern Russia and Alaska.</p>
<p>So the geography of the continents as we know them today began to emerge.</p>
<p>But something else also started to happen.</p>
<p>As the world became wetter and warmer, carbon dioxide levels increased.</p>
<p>And with more warmth, more moisture, and more carbon dioxide, plants began to grow in abundance.</p>
<p>Dense forests began to emerge over the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Now dense forests were good for some animals, but not good for others.</p>
<p>For example, horses thrive in grasslands, but they struggle in forest environments.</p>
<p>And with these new dense forests, the land that was available to roaming horses became</p>
<p>more and more scarce.</p>
<p>In fact, horses became completely extinct in North America.</p>
<p>They also disappeared from modern-day Iran, lowland Mesopotamia, and the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>And in Europe, horse populations also declined significantly as a consequence of these expanding</p>
<p>thick forests.</p>
<p>But one of the few places where horses continued to live and where they actually flourished</p>
<p>was the Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>The environment was perfectly suited for them.</p>
<p>Large open grassy plains enabled horses to live and their populations grew in this area.</p>
<p>So when we first look at the steppe region, say around 7000 BC, we find a region with</p>
<p>a significant horse population.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t find many humans there.</p>
<p>At this point, most humans were still hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>There was some very early animal domestication and plant cultivation in parts of the Middle</p>
<p>East, but in Europe and in the areas north of the Black Sea and Caspian Seas, humans</p>
<p>still lived by hunting and gathering.</p>
<p>And at this early stage, the steppe region was a harsh environment for humans.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers thrived in the region north of the Eurasian steppes, in the forested areas</p>
<p>of northern Russia.</p>
<p>But further south, in the vast steppe region, which extended east-west across Eurasia, hunter-gatherers</p>
<p>could not survive for any extended period.</p>
<p>The open grassy steppes were largely useless to humans.</p>
<p>Humans can&rsquo;t live on grass and the steppes were difficult to cross by foot.</p>
<p>There were also relatively few animals in the steppe region which could be captured</p>
<p>and eaten by humans.</p>
<p>As a result, an extended migration into the steppes beyond the river valleys could be</p>
<p>a life-threatening event.</p>
<p>But around 5700 B.C., all of that started to change.</p>
<p>Around that time, domesticated sheep and cattle began to arrive from areas in southeastern</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>But it took about five more centuries, until around 5200 B.C., for the people of the steppes</p>
<p>to incorporate cattle herding into their economy.</p>
<p>And the arrival of cattle and sheep changed everything.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just some cattle and sheep, right?</p>
<p>But for historians of this period, it&rsquo;s a seismic event.</p>
<p>Because now, for the first time, human beings could actually enter into and live within</p>
<p>the steppe region for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>And that means they could begin to cross the steppes.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection there?</p>
<p>Well, with the arrival of cattle and sheep, these people stopped being hunter-gatherers</p>
<p>in the traditional sense of the term.</p>
<p>They now had domesticated animals.</p>
<p>They were herders.</p>
<p>Though the humans couldn&rsquo;t live off of grass, the cattle and sheep could.</p>
<p>And the humans could live off the cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>Cattle meant that these people had regular access to meat, and also milk, cheese, and</p>
<p>dairy products.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>These people were no longer hunter-gatherers, dependent on what they could find and catch.</p>
<p>They could now travel with their food resources.</p>
<p>And in time, as we&rsquo;ll see, they could live off the animals for extended periods of time</p>
<p>without even having to kill or eat them, because they provided milk, cheese, and other dairy</p>
<p>products which could be replenished without sacrificing the animal.</p>
<p>But just as importantly, as I discussed in the last episode, sheep began to evolve after</p>
<p>they were introduced to the colder climates of Europe.</p>
<p>Sheep wool began to grow longer and thicker in the colder climate.</p>
<p>And that enabled these ancient humans to use the wool for weaving.</p>
<p>And woven textiles and fabrics started to be produced.</p>
<p>That meant these people could make clothing, tents, and other textile products as they</p>
<p>needed.</p>
<p>Now, longer treks into the cold and forbidding steppes were possible.</p>
<p>Not necessarily easy, but possible.</p>
<p>To put this timeline into some additional context, at the time when cattle and sheep</p>
<p>were first introduced into the steppes, around 5700 B.C., and when they were first domesticated</p>
<p>there, around 5200 B.C., the first agricultural communities were just starting to emerge</p>
<p>at Sumer in southern Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>But even so, it would still take another 2,000 years for the first cities to emerge there,</p>
<p>which would be the first cities known to the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first European agricultural settlements and farming villages were just</p>
<p>starting to emerge in the Balkans, around modern-day Romania and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>These Balkan settlements were spawned by the adoption of agriculture, farming, and crop</p>
<p>planting in those areas.</p>
<p>But in the steppes there is no evidence of widespread farming.</p>
<p>These people were herders, not grain farmers.</p>
<p>Around this same time, the post-glacial warming period after the end of the Ice Age reached</p>
<p>its maximum.</p>
<p>Forests of elm, oak, and lime had spread across northern Europe north of the steppes.</p>
<p>And wild honeybees, which nest in oak and lime trees, spread with these trees throughout</p>
<p>this region.</p>
<p>But these trees did not extend into Asia beyond the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned in the last episode, honeybees were confined to this area west of the Ural</p>
<p>Mountains and not the area east of the Urals.</p>
<p>By this point, we&rsquo;ve established that cattle and sheep had been introduced to the steppes.</p>
<p>And this allowed the first extended forays by humans into the steppes beyond the river</p>
<p>valleys.</p>
<p>But as I said, it wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p>It was difficult and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>Both humans and the animals needed access to water to survive.</p>
<p>And when these people left the river valleys for the vast openness of the steppes, there</p>
<p>was no guarantee that they would have access to water.</p>
<p>They also had to carry their belongings with them as they traveled, which meant that shelter</p>
<p>and supplies were limited.</p>
<p>There was only so much humans could carry over long distances.</p>
<p>But circumstances started to change a few centuries later, around 4800 B.C.</p>
<p>We are now almost at the beginning of the period in which the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language was spoken.</p>
<p>Around this time, another major event occurred when horses were domesticated.</p>
<p>Many archaeologists believe that horses were first domesticated in this same steppe region</p>
<p>north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, where the original Indo-Europeans likely originated.</p>
<p>Remember, wild horses flourished in this area because it was basically an open grassy pasture.</p>
<p>And when these people first figured out how to domesticate horses, they did it to create</p>
<p>a new source of meat.</p>
<p>I mean, horses were a cheap source of winter meat because they would use their hooves to</p>
<p>break through the snow and ice to eat the grass underneath.</p>
<p>Other animals would not or could not do that.</p>
<p>So this meant that horses could feed themselves through winter, and that alleviated the burden</p>
<p>of maintaining a large herd of other types of domesticated animals, which were difficult</p>
<p>to maintain in the harsh winters of this region.</p>
<p>A few centuries later, probably around 4200 B.C., it&rsquo;s believed that the steppe from</p>
<p>eating horses to riding them took place.</p>
<p>Again, this same region is believed to be the place where horse riding first began.</p>
<p>Eventually, over the next thousand years or so, horse riding would spread outward from</p>
<p>this region into neighboring regions.</p>
<p>And here we find the first major advantage which these steppe herders had over their neighbors.</p>
<p>The domestication of the horse, combined with the ability to ride them, gave these people</p>
<p>a massive advantage over other people whom they would eventually encounter.</p>
<p>Horse riding had major economic consequences for the people of the steppes.</p>
<p>It made herding much easier and much more efficient.</p>
<p>Without horses, a herder could herd around 200 sheep.</p>
<p>But on horseback, the same herder could herd around 500 sheep, two-and-a-half times as many.</p>
<p>Therefore, horse riding allowed individuals to maintain larger herds of cattle and sheep,</p>
<p>which permitted greater accumulation of animal wealth.</p>
<p>It also ensured increased mobility and more long-distance trade.</p>
<p>And it allowed these people to scout for water and other sources of food much more efficiently</p>
<p>while migrating.</p>
<p>It also probably increased warfare against other herders and against settled agricultural</p>
<p>communities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because larger herds required larger pastures, which meant conflicts with other</p>
<p>herders and sometimes fixed agricultural settlements.</p>
<p>Warfare and conflicts between these people and their neighbors was tribal in nature.</p>
<p>In other words, there were no organized armies, just raiding and fighting between clans.</p>
<p>And these factors may have led to the expansion and migration of these people across the steppes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about the advantages of horse domestication and horse riding, which</p>
<p>was initially unique to this area and which gave these people a distinct economic and</p>
<p>military advantage over their neighbors.</p>
<p>We now have to introduce another piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>This piece is the result of some recent research, not by linguists or archaeologists, but by</p>
<p>geneticists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating bit of research, which may tell us a lot about how this particular</p>
<p>group of people were able to spread themselves and their language over such a vast geographic</p>
<p>area.</p>
<p>And it had to do, surprisingly enough, with their ability to consume milk and dairy products.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, the original Indo-European speakers in the region north of the Black</p>
<p>Sea were herders and pastoralists, but they were not especially skilled at grain agriculture</p>
<p>and crop planting, like was starting to occur to the west of the Black Sea in the Balkans.</p>
<p>They were also backward compared to emerging societies in the Near East when it came to</p>
<p>things like writing, arithmetic, cities, and irrigation systems.</p>
<p>So how was it that the language of these steppe herders, who appear at this point to be at</p>
<p>a disadvantage compared to many of their neighbors, how was it that their language spread so far</p>
<p>so quickly?</p>
<p>Some genetics researchers now believe that their primary advantage may have come from</p>
<p>an early lactose-tolerant mutation, which has been clearly documented.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explore this research.</p>
<p>Lactose is the main sugar in milk.</p>
<p>And in order to consume milk and other dairy products, humans have to produce an enzyme</p>
<p>called lactase, which allows for the body to digest the lactose.</p>
<p>So if you produce this lactase enzyme, you can consume milk and dairy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t produce this enzyme, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Today, a majority of the world&rsquo;s population produces this enzyme, and they can consume</p>
<p>dairy products.</p>
<p>In other words, they are lactose-tolerant.</p>
<p>But that was not the case in early humans.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not until around this period in our story of early humans that this genetic</p>
<p>mutation began to occur.</p>
<p>Early humans, when they were hunter-gatherers, produced the lactase enzyme as babies, and</p>
<p>they could consume milk as small children.</p>
<p>But as children grew older, they would stop producing the enzyme, and the children would</p>
<p>become lactose-intolerant.</p>
<p>So babies could drink milk, but they lost that ability as they got older.</p>
<p>But a mutation occurred in Europe, which allowed adults to continue to produce lactase and</p>
<p>therefore maintain the ability to consume milk and dairy products throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p>In other words, they became lactose-tolerant in adulthood.</p>
<p>And according to recent genetic research on the worldwide distribution of this genetic</p>
<p>mutation, it probably emerged first in the very steppe region that we&rsquo;ve been discussing,</p>
<p>in the area north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, between 4600 and 2800 BC.</p>
<p>That puts the mutation right in the heart of the Indo-European homeland, during the</p>
<p>exact same time frame that the original Indo-European language was being spoken.</p>
<p>And the timing also means the mutation occurred shortly after the early Indo-Europeans began</p>
<p>to domesticate cattle and goats.</p>
<p>Now many geneticists believe that this particular genetic mutation tended to occur when early</p>
<p>humans began to domesticate cattle and other milk-producing animals.</p>
<p>And they have identified the same mutation amongst the tribes in Arabia after the domestication</p>
<p>of camels.</p>
<p>And it occurred again among the Tutsi tribes in Africa after they domesticated cattle.</p>
<p>Cattle would have been used initially for meat and for plowing and pulling wagons.</p>
<p>They would also be used for products like leather.</p>
<p>But once this genetic mutation occurred within a tribe, and it spread to enough members of</p>
<p>that tribe, a new kind of pastoral society emerged, one in which people kept cattle primarily</p>
<p>for milk and dairy, rather than meat.</p>
<p>In other words, it resulted in dairy farming.</p>
<p>This type of farming is far more efficient than raising cattle for slaughter.</p>
<p>It produces five times as many calories per acre.</p>
<p>Therefore, with this genetic mutation in place, the original Indo-European speakers could</p>
<p>raise and feed more people, and therefore more warriors, on the same amount of land</p>
<p>as their neighbors.</p>
<p>Remember that Europe was very sparsely populated at this time, so even modest population growth</p>
<p>could produce significant population advantages.</p>
<p>As these dairy farmers began to outnumber neighboring foragers and grain farmers, they</p>
<p>would have expanded at the expense of their neighbors.</p>
<p>Their culture, their way of life, and their languages would have traveled with them.</p>
<p>This advantage would have allowed them to expand into areas previously occupied by foragers</p>
<p>and grain farmers, like the Balkans, Central Europe, and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>But it would not have been an advantage against established cities, like those in Sumeria</p>
<p>and Mesopotamia, and this may explain some of the limits of Indo-European expansion.</p>
<p>As dairy farmers, Indo-European speakers would have also had the advantage of mobility.</p>
<p>This is also a military advantage.</p>
<p>Farmers have homes and villages that they have to defend, but herders and pastoralists</p>
<p>can fight when and where they choose, particularly when you add the advantage of being able to</p>
<p>ride on horseback, which these people had mastered.</p>
<p>By around 4000 B.C., which, remember, is very early in the period of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language, Indo-European speakers were beginning to spread from the area north of the Black</p>
<p>Sea westward into the Balkans and the Danube Valley west of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Remember that this area had seen some of the first agricultural settlements in Europe.</p>
<p>It was the area located just north of the pass between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean</p>
<p>Sea which I discussed in the last episode.</p>
<p>This was one of the few points which permitted relatively easy travel from the north to the</p>
<p>south.</p>
<p>And grain agriculture and copper-making technology from the Near East had spread into this region</p>
<p>of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>And as the horse-riding Indo-Europeans moved into this region from the north, the likely</p>
<p>result was an era of warfare, migration, and dislocation.</p>
<p>The archaeological record also seems to confirm this.</p>
<p>These Indo-Europeans who were moving westward into the Balkans were likely the ancestors</p>
<p>of the Hittites and the other Anatolian speakers.</p>
<p>If you recall, the Anatolian branch, which includes Hittite, is the oldest branch of</p>
<p>the Indo-European language family.</p>
<p>But more on that later.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at what the archaeological evidence indicates in this Balkan region west</p>
<p>of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have discovered that the early settlements in this region were abandoned</p>
<p>around 4000 BC, which is the period in which the first Indo-European herders began to move</p>
<p>into this region.</p>
<p>But they also noticed something else.</p>
<p>A particular type of burial associated with these Indo-European step-people, called Kurgan</p>
<p>burials, began to appear in this region of the Balkans at the same time and in much greater</p>
<p>numbers.</p>
<p>Kurgan graves were pit graves covered by wooden beams and marked by a round mound on top.</p>
<p>And as I said, these graves were the type generally associated with these Indo-European</p>
<p>herdsmen.</p>
<p>And here is a very important key.</p>
<p>When modern archaeologists discovered these Kurgan burial sites in the Balkans, the bodies</p>
<p>uncovered in those graves averaged almost 4 inches taller than people discovered in</p>
<p>other graves of the same time period in the same region.</p>
<p>This is believed to be confirmation of the physical advantages which these step-herders</p>
<p>had as a result of their increasing reliance on dairy farming.</p>
<p>So compared to most of the populations of Europe and Asia, these step-dairy farmers</p>
<p>had begun to develop distinct advantages over their neighbors in Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>They had domesticated horses and had developed the ability to ride them.</p>
<p>And this increased their mobility, which increased the size of the herds which they</p>
<p>could maintain, and that increased their wealth substantially.</p>
<p>It also gave them a huge advantage in raiding and warfare.</p>
<p>And they had developed a specific genetic mutation for lactose tolerance which allowed</p>
<p>them to consume milk and dairy products in adulthood.</p>
<p>And this allowed them to feed and support more people without sacrificing their animals.</p>
<p>And it produced a population which was generally larger and healthier than their neighbors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believed that the early Indo-European herders became more warlike as their mobility,</p>
<p>superior numbers, and better nutrition allowed them to win battles against other peoples.</p>
<p>And by the way, I mentioned earlier that researchers have identified the same genetic mutation</p>
<p>for lactose tolerance among the first peoples of the Arabian Peninsula to domesticate camels</p>
<p>and the first Tutsi tribes in Africa to domesticate cattle.</p>
<p>And in those cases, just like with the Indo-Europeans, this genetic mutation led to a period of tribal</p>
<p>growth and was immediately followed by a period of expansion at the expense of their neighbors.</p>
<p>So this appears to be part of a recurring trend in ancient history between cattle domestication</p>
<p>lactose tolerance, tribal growth, and eventual economic and military expansion.</p>
<p>One other quick note about genetics, just to be clear.</p>
<p>I am not saying, as some have in the past, that the original Indo-Europeans were genetically</p>
<p>superior to other people in general.</p>
<p>It was just that they had acquired lactose tolerance early on.</p>
<p>And that gave them an advantage relative to their neighbors for a period of time until</p>
<p>the mutation had spread far beyond those original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>But that short-term advantage would have been a huge factor in the growth and expansion</p>
<p>of these tribes over the next few centuries.</p>
<p>We can now move ahead a bit in our story to around 3500 BC.</p>
<p>So right now, we&rsquo;re in the middle of the period in which the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language was being spoken.</p>
<p>At this point, the steppes started to become significantly drier and colder.</p>
<p>This meant that animal herds had to be moved more frequently.</p>
<p>And while the steppes were now open to these ancient humans, it was still challenging,</p>
<p>and it was a difficult environment.</p>
<p>As these herders moved, they had to carry their belongings with them, including clothing</p>
<p>and shelter.</p>
<p>And that was a challenge.</p>
<p>And it became even more of a challenge in the drier and colder environment.</p>
<p>With less water and colder temperatures, they needed access to more water and shelter.</p>
<p>And they needed to migrate even more often because vegetation was becoming more limited.</p>
<p>And herds were now growing bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the final piece of the puzzle arrived.</p>
<p>It was a new technology which allowed these early Indo-Europeans to become masters of</p>
<p>the steppes.</p>
<p>And that thereby enabled their language to spread over vast distances.</p>
<p>And that technology was the wheeled wagon.</p>
<p>Around 3400 BC, the wheeled wagon was introduced to the steppes.</p>
<p>Remember that the original Indo-European language had two words for wheel.</p>
<p>And they also had other words for axle and theel, which is the pole to which animals</p>
<p>were yoked.</p>
<p>And they also had a verb meaning to ride, in the sense of ride in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence also confirms the introduction of wheeled wagons in this area</p>
<p>around the same time.</p>
<p>Now no one knows exactly when the first wheel or wheeled vehicle was discovered.</p>
<p>I think we have this popular notion that the wheel was invented by cavemen in the Stone</p>
<p>Age.</p>
<p>That notion probably comes from comic strips, maybe from the Flintstones.</p>
<p>But the reality is that the wheel, and certainly the wheeled vehicle, is a much more recent</p>
<p>invention.</p>
<p>Around 4000 BC, potters were using a potter&rsquo;s wheel to make pottery and clay vessels in</p>
<p>Sumeria.</p>
<p>And around 3600 BC, the first pictures and drawings of wheeled vehicles began to appear</p>
<p>in Sumeria.</p>
<p>And the archaeological records confirm that wheeled vehicles were in use on the Eurasian</p>
<p>steppes by a couple of centuries later.</p>
<p>Regardless of exactly when and where the wheeled vehicle was invented, they were on the steppes</p>
<p>around 3400 BC.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>Before the wheeled vehicles arrived, these herders had just started to break free from</p>
<p>the river valleys, where water and vegetation were abundant.</p>
<p>But remember, it was still a risky venture.</p>
<p>But now they could load up their wagons with water and food and tents and other belongings</p>
<p>and head out into the steppes with their herds for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>These herders could now move indefinitely.</p>
<p>And they could live on the steppes for months at a time.</p>
<p>The wagon, which was pulled by the cattle, basically became a mobile home.</p>
<p>And it permitted the dispersal of people throughout the steppes and eventually throughout Europe</p>
<p>and Central Asia.</p>
<p>The steppes became large open pastures, which in turn allowed herders to keep even larger</p>
<p>herds.</p>
<p>But again, this increased mobility and larger herds increased the potential conflict with</p>
<p>other nomadic herders competing for the same land.</p>
<p>This may have also encouraged the building of alliances between herders to manage the</p>
<p>potential conflicts.</p>
<p>As you may recall from an earlier episode, the original Indo-European speakers used the</p>
<p>same word for both a guest and a host.</p>
<p>The word was ghosti.</p>
<p>And the existence of this word suggests the reciprocal nature of the relationship as herders</p>
<p>allowed each other to pass through their respective territories.</p>
<p>In other words, today&rsquo;s host is tomorrow&rsquo;s guest.</p>
<p>These relationships established mutual obligations, similar to kinship relationships, and were</p>
<p>necessary to facilitate the movement of these herds.</p>
<p>So now we have all the pieces in place.</p>
<p>The cattle, sheep, and domesticated horses gave these early Indo-Europeans access to</p>
<p>the steppes.</p>
<p>A genetic mutation allowed them to consume milk and dairy products, which allowed them</p>
<p>to become dairy farmers and support bigger and healthier populations, and to maintain</p>
<p>large herds without having to slaughter them for food.</p>
<p>So as the size of the tribes increased, the physical size of the tribe members increased,</p>
<p>and the size of their flocks increased.</p>
<p>So that meant their power and wealth increased.</p>
<p>It also required more mobility, since large herds need more land to graze.</p>
<p>This resulted in a sophisticated system of guest-host relationships.</p>
<p>And when the covered wheeled wagon was introduced a short time later, their mobility increased</p>
<p>exponentially.</p>
<p>They were now masters of the steppes, and they were on the move.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now entered the era of pastoral nomads.</p>
<p>Movement and migration became the norm for these people.</p>
<p>The horse and wagons had transformed the steppes from an ecological barrier to a transcontinental</p>
<p>highway, and it enabled the spread and expansion of the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>We are now ready for the expansion of the Indo-European language.</p>
<p>As I said, with the growth in the population of these tribes, combined with the growth</p>
<p>in the size of the herds, there was a constant need for migration and expansion.</p>
<p>It was basically a nomadic lifestyle which meant move or die.</p>
<p>Sometimes this expansion occurred through military power.</p>
<p>Sometimes it occurred through migration and displacement of other peoples.</p>
<p>Sometimes it occurred through intermarriage and coalition building and integration.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was likely a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>So the original Indo-European language expanded with the expansion of these people, but not</p>
<p>always through military conquest.</p>
<p>But these Indo-European people tended to be the dominant people in these new societies.</p>
<p>And the language of the dominant group tends to perpetuate.</p>
<p>So that was typically the original Indo-European language spoken by these people.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that around 4200 B.C. or so, Indo-European herders were beginning</p>
<p>to spread southwestward around the Black Sea in a counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p>And as you may recall, they encountered farming settlements in the Balkans west of the Black</p>
<p>Sea.</p>
<p>And the archaeological evidence indicates that many of these settlements were abandoned</p>
<p>and overrun by the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>So historians believe this branch of early Indo-Europeans were the early ancestors of</p>
<p>the oldest known branch of the Indo-European family tree, the Anatolian branch.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, these speakers continued their southward migration for the next few</p>
<p>centuries, eventually ending up in Anatolia, which is modern-day Turkey, south of the</p>
<p>Black Sea.</p>
<p>The most well-known of these Anatolian speakers were the Hittites.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t emerge until a little later in our story.</p>
<p>But while these speakers were continuing their migration southward, another branch probably</p>
<p>started to emerge.</p>
<p>Around 3600 B.C., another branch of early Indo-European speakers had probably started</p>
<p>to separate from the main group.</p>
<p>But this group appears to have moved eastward along the steps into central and eventually</p>
<p>eastern Asia.</p>
<p>These were the ancestors of the Ticarian speakers in northwestern China.</p>
<p>An early split at around this time for this group is not shared by some historians, but</p>
<p>it does help to explain why the Ticarian language is a Kentem language, but all the other eastern</p>
<p>Indo-European languages are Satem languages.</p>
<p>Remember from an earlier episode, there was a general division of the Indo-European languages</p>
<p>into an eastern group, which used an S sound for certain words, like the Sanskrit word</p>
<p>Satem for hundred, and there was a western group of languages, which used a K sound,</p>
<p>like the Latin word Kentem for the same word, hundred.</p>
<p>And this K sound used within the Kentem group appears to be a continuation of the original</p>
<p>K sound used by the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>But these Ticarian speakers, who lived all the way in western China, did not speak a</p>
<p>Satem language like the other eastern groups.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s believed that these early ancestors of the Ticarian speakers broke away from the</p>
<p>main group of Indo-Europeans before the Kentem-Satem split occurred.</p>
<p>Again, this is one theory.</p>
<p>And they lived around the Ural River in the steppe region for a while, between Europe</p>
<p>and Asia.</p>
<p>And later they migrated eastward, across modern Kazakhstan, east of the Caspian Sea, into</p>
<p>the mountains in the area where modern-day China, Russia, and Mongolia meet.</p>
<p>And these speakers spoke an Indo-European dialect, which ultimately developed into the</p>
<p>Ticarian branch, which was spoken in Xinjiang in the northwestern corner of China.</p>
<p>And it was a language that was actually spoken there until around the seventh century A.D.</p>
<p>And the physical evidence for the early separation of the Anatolian speakers of Turkey and the</p>
<p>Ticarian speakers of northwestern China around this time frame, we also have some linguistic</p>
<p>evidence to confirm this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the Kentem-Satem distinction.</p>
<p>And both of these early languages were spoken in the east, but remember they were not Satem</p>
<p>languages like the other eastern Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>So that suggests that they must have separated from the original group at a different point</p>
<p>than the rest of the Satem language ancestors.</p>
<p>The other clue is that these Anatolian and Ticarian languages don&rsquo;t have reconstructed</p>
<p>Indo-European words for wagons or wheels.</p>
<p>And that suggests that they must have separated from the main Indo-European groups before</p>
<p>the wagon and the wheel vocabulary was adopted into the early Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In other words, before wheeled wagons existed in the steppes.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, wheeled wagons appeared on the steppes around 3400 B.C.</p>
<p>So this evidence suggests that these groups were separate and distinct from the main group</p>
<p>before 3400 B.C.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s around this same time, say around 3400 or 3500 B.C., that the very first cities started</p>
<p>to emerge in southern Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Those are the cities of Uruk and Ur in the area known as Sumer.</p>
<p>So everything we&rsquo;ve discussed up to this point has occurred in early human prehistory before</p>
<p>cities of any kind existed anywhere.</p>
<p>And though it doesn&rsquo;t directly concern our story of the early Indo-Europeans, I should</p>
<p>note that the first known writing starts to emerge at this point in those early cities</p>
<p>of Sumer.</p>
<p>And the writing developed to record economic transactions and to compile inventories.</p>
<p>This was the ancient Sumerian language, which is not an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>But the idea of writing and the written language is important to our story.</p>
<p>So hold on to that idea because it soon becomes very important.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned Sumer at this point, I guess I should also mention another group there</p>
<p>who will become important to our story a little bit later.</p>
<p>The Semitic people who spoke a group of closely related Semitic languages.</p>
<p>At around this point in our story, they still lived in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Some of them lived and spoke Semitic languages in the south of Sumer.</p>
<p>But most of them lived further up the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in central Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Since the ultimate origin of our alphabet lies with the descendants of these Semitic</p>
<p>speakers, this is a good time to mention them, as it is their first known appearance on the</p>
<p>historical scene.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point in our story that something else very, very important to our</p>
<p>story occurred.</p>
<p>Around 3300 B.C., many linguists and archaeologists believe the first ancestors of the Germanic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes started to split away from the main group of Indo-European speakers.</p>
<p>Since these were the ancient linguistic ancestors of English, they are of particular interest</p>
<p>to us.</p>
<p>At this point, the Indo-Europeans were probably not a specific group of people as much as</p>
<p>an interrelated group of nomads and herders.</p>
<p>They were probably somewhat analogous to the Celtic people of central and western Europe</p>
<p>who emerged many centuries later.</p>
<p>And by that I mean that these people had a shared set of dialects within the same language</p>
<p>family and they also shared other common cultural features.</p>
<p>But they probably did not see themselves, nor were they probably viewed by others, as</p>
<p>some unified group of people or tribes.</p>
<p>We kind of lumped these various interrelated people together in retrospect.</p>
<p>So there were many subgroups within this larger Indo-European group.</p>
<p>And one of these lived on the western edge of the region where the early Indo-European</p>
<p>dialects were being spoken, specifically in and around the northwestern portion of the</p>
<p>Black Sea.</p>
<p>They were part of a culture that archaeologists call the Ussutovo culture.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this group of Indo-Europeans who spoke a dialect which many historians now</p>
<p>believe led to the original Germanic language from which English derived.</p>
<p>So with this little cliffhanger in place, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this episode at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>And next time, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at these ancestors of the Germanic speakers</p>
<p>and how their language found their way to the Germanic homeland in northern Europe.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll also complete the migrations of the Indo-European tribes to establish a general</p>
<p>time frame for the emergence of the first Greeks, the first Latin speakers, and the</p>
<p>first Celts.</p>
<p>So in sum, next time we&rsquo;ll conclude our look at the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll begin to look at the ancestors of the early Germanic tribes and the immediate</p>
<p>ancestors of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Celts.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
