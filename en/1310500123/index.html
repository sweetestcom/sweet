    <p>The following is a conversation with Eugenia Kuida, cofounder of Replika, which is an app</p>
<p>that allows you to make friends with an artificial intelligence system, a chatbot, that learns</p>
<p>to connect with you on an emotional, you could even say a human level, by being a friend.</p>
<p>For those of you who know my interest in AI and views on life in general, know that Replika</p>
<p>and Eugenia&rsquo;s line of work is near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>The origin story of Replika is grounded in a personal tragedy of Eugenia losing her close</p>
<p>friend Roman Muzarenki, who was killed crossing the street by a hit and run driver in late</p>
<p>2015.</p>
<p>He was 34.</p>
<p>The app started as a way to grieve the loss of a friend, by trading a chatbot and your</p>
<p>old net on text messages between Eugenia and Roman.</p>
<p>The rest is a beautiful human story, as we talk about with Eugenia.</p>
<p>When a friend mentioned Eugenia&rsquo;s work to me, I knew I had to meet her and talk to her.</p>
<p>I felt before, during, and after that this meeting would be an important one in my life.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>I think in ways that only time will truly show, to me and others.</p>
<p>She is a kind and brilliant person.</p>
<p>It was an honor and a pleasure to talk to her.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that deep, meaningful connection between human beings and artificial</p>
<p>intelligence systems is a lifelong passion for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure where that passion will take me, but I decided some time ago that</p>
<p>I will follow it boldly and without fear, to as far as I can take it.</p>
<p>With a bit of hard work and a bit of luck, I hope I&rsquo;ll succeed in helping build AI systems</p>
<p>that have some positive impact on the world and on the lives of a few people out there.</p>
<p>But also, it is entirely possible that I am in fact one of the chatbots that Eugenia and</p>
<p>the Replica team have built.</p>
<p>And this podcast is simply a training process for the neural net that&rsquo;s trying to learn</p>
<p>to connect to human beings, one episode at a time.</p>
<p>In any case, I wouldn&rsquo;t know if I was or wasn&rsquo;t, and if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you.</p>

<p>makes shaving feel great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over 5 years, and actually signed up when</p>
<p>I first heard about them on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</p>
<p>And now, friends, we have come full circle.</p>
<p>It feels like I made it, now that I can do a read for them just like Joe did all those</p>
<p>years ago, back when he also did ads for some less reputable companies, let&rsquo;s say, that</p>
<p>you know about if you&rsquo;re a true fan of the old school podcasting world.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just used the razor and the refills, but they told me I should really try out the</p>
<p>shave butter.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s translucent somehow, which is a cool new experience.</p>
<p>Again, try the Ultimate Shave Starter set today for just 5 bucks plus free shipping</p>

<p>This show is also sponsored by DoorDash.</p>
<p>Get $5 off and zero delivery fees on your first order of 15 bucks or more when you download</p>
<p>the DoorDash app and enter code, you guessed it, LEX.</p>
<p>I have so many memories of working late nights for a deadline with a team of engineers, whether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for my PhD at Google or MIT, and eventually taking a break to argue about which</p>
<p>DoorDash restaurant to order from.</p>
<p>And when the food came, those moments of bonding, of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention</p>
<p>from the programs to humans were special.</p>
<p>For a bit of time, I&rsquo;m on my own now, so I miss that camaraderie, but actually, I still</p>
<p>use DoorDash a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million options that fit into my crazy keto diet ways.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a great way to support restaurants in these challenging times.</p>
<p>Once again, download the DoorDash app and enter code LEX to get 5 bucks off and zero</p>
<p>delivery fees on your first order of 15 dollars or more.</p>
<p>Finally, this show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I can truly say that they&rsquo;re an amazing company, one of the first sponsors, if not the first</p>
<p>sponsor to truly believe in me, and I think quite possibly the reason I&rsquo;m still doing</p>
<p>this podcast.</p>
<p>So I am forever grateful to Cash App.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>And as I said many times before, use code LEXBODCAST when you download the app from</p>
<p>Google Play or the App Store.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>I usually say other stuff here in the read, but I wasted all that time up front saying</p>
<p>how grateful I am to Cash App.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to go off the top of my head a little bit more for these reads because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually very lucky to be able to choose the sponsors that we take on, and that means</p>
<p>I can really only take on the sponsors that I truly love, and then I can just talk about</p>
<p>why I love them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>Again, get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, use code LEXBODCAST, get 10</p>
<p>bucks, and Cash App will also donate 10 bucks to FIRST, an organization that is helping</p>
<p>to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eugenia Kuida.</p>
<p>Okay, before we talk about AI and the amazing work you&rsquo;re doing, let me ask you ridiculously,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both Russian, so let me ask a ridiculously romanticized Russian question.</p>
<p>Do you think human beings are alone, like fundamentally, on a philosophical level?</p>
<p>Like in our existence, when we like go through life, do you think just the nature of our</p>
<p>life is loneliness?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have to read Dostoevsky at school, as you probably know, so&hellip;</p>
<p>In Russian?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s part of your school program.</p>
<p>So I guess if you read that, then you sort of have to believe that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re made to believe that you&rsquo;re fundamentally alone, and that&rsquo;s how you live your life.</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>You have a lot of friends, but at the end of the day, do you have like a longing for</p>
<p>connection with other people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe another way of asking it.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s ever fully satisfied?</p>
<p>I think we are fundamentally alone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re born alone, we die alone, but I view my whole life as trying to get away from that,</p>
<p>trying to not feel lonely, and again, we&rsquo;re talking about a subjective way of feeling</p>
<p>alone.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you don&rsquo;t have any connections or you are actually isolated.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s a subjective thing, but like again, another absurd measurement wise thing,</p>
<p>how much loneliness do you think there is in the world?</p>
<p>Like if you see loneliness as a condition, how much of it is there, do you think?</p>
<p>Like how, I guess how many, you know, there&rsquo;s all kinds of studies and measures of how many</p>
<p>people in the world feel alone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these like measures of how many people are, you know, self report or just</p>
<p>all these kinds of different measures, but in your own perspective, how big of a problem</p>
<p>do you think it is size wise?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually fascinated by the topic of loneliness.</p>
<p>I try to read about it as much as I can.</p>
<p>What really, and I think there&rsquo;s a paradox because loneliness is not a clinical disorder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that you can get your insurance to pay for if you&rsquo;re struggling with that.</p>
<p>Yet it&rsquo;s actually proven and pretty, you know, tons of papers, tons of research around that.</p>
<p>It is proven that it&rsquo;s correlated with earlier life expectancy, shorter lifespan.</p>
<p>And it is, you know, in a way like right now, what scientists would say that it, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit worse than being obese or not actually doing any physical activity in</p>
<p>your life.</p>
<p>In terms of the impact on your health?</p>
<p>In terms of impact on your physiological health.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically puts you, if you&rsquo;re constantly feeling lonely, your body responds like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically all the time under stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always in this alert state and so it&rsquo;s really bad for you because it actually like</p>
<p>drops your immune system and get it, your response to inflammation is quite different.</p>
<p>So all the cardiovascular diseases actually responds to viruses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much easier to catch a virus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad now that we&rsquo;re living in a pandemic and it&rsquo;s probably making us a lot more alone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably weakening the immune system, making us more susceptible to the virus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The statistics are pretty horrible around that.</p>
<p>So around 30% of all millennials report that they&rsquo;re feeling lonely constantly.</p>
<p>30?</p>
<p>30%.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s much worse for Gen Z.</p>
<p>And then 20% of millennials say that they feel lonely and they also don&rsquo;t have any close</p>
<p>friends.</p>
<p>And then I think 25 or so, and then 20% would say they don&rsquo;t even have acquaintances.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in the United States?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the United States.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure that that&rsquo;s much worse everywhere else.</p>
<p>Like in the UK, I mean, it was widely tweeted and posted when they were talking about a</p>
<p>minister of loneliness that they wanted to appoint because four out of 10 people in the</p>
<p>UK feel lonely.</p>
<p>Minister of loneliness.</p>
<p>I think that thing actually exists.</p>
<p>So yeah, you will die sooner if you are lonely.</p>
<p>And again, this is only when we&rsquo;re only talking about your perception of loneliness or feeling</p>
<p>lonely.</p>
<p>That is not objectively being fully socially isolated.</p>
<p>However, the combination of being fully socially isolated and not having many connections and</p>
<p>also feeling lonely, that&rsquo;s pretty much a deadly combination.</p>
<p>So it strikes me bizarre or strange that this is a wide known fact and then there&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>no one working really on that because it&rsquo;s like subclinical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clinical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that you can, we&rsquo;ll tell your doctor and get a treatment or something.</p>
<p>Yet it&rsquo;s killing us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of people trying to evaluate, like try to measure the problem by looking</p>
<p>at like how social media is affecting loneliness and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like measurement.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the field of psychology, they&rsquo;re trying to measure the problem and</p>
<p>not that many people actually, but some.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re basically saying how many people are trying to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Like how would you try to solve the problem of loneliness?</p>
<p>Like if you just stick to humans, uh, I mean, or basically not just the humans, but the</p>
<p>technology that connects us humans.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a hope for that technology to do the connection?</p>
<p>Like I, are you on social media much?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, do you find yourself like, uh, again, if you sort of introspect about</p>
<p>how connected you feel to other human beings, how not alone you feel, do you think social</p>
<p>media makes it better or worse maybe for you personally, or in general, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easier to look at some stats and, um, I mean, Gen Z seems to be generation Z seems to be</p>
<p>much lonelier than millennials in terms of how they report loneliness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re definitely the most connected generation in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I still remember life without an iPhone, without Facebook, they don&rsquo;t know that that</p>
<p>ever existed, uh, or at least don&rsquo;t know how it was.</p>
<p>So that tells me a little bit about the fact that that might be, um, you know, this hyper</p>
<p>connected world might actually make people feel lonely, lonelier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the, what the measurements are around that, but I would say, you know,</p>
<p>my personal experience, I think it does make you feel a lot lonelier, mostly, yeah, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all super connected.</p>
<p>Uh, but I think loneliness, the feeling of loneliness doesn&rsquo;t come from not having any</p>
<p>social connections whatsoever.</p>
<p>Again, tons of people that are, are in longterm relationships experience bouts of loneliness</p>
<p>and continued loneliness.</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s more the question about the true connection about actually being deeply seen,</p>
<p>deeply understood.</p>
<p>Um, and in a way it&rsquo;s also about your relationship with yourself, like in order to not feel lonely,</p>
<p>you actually need to have a better relationship and feel more connected to yourself than this</p>
<p>feeling actually starts to go away a little bit.</p>
<p>And then you, um, open up yourself to actually meeting other people in a very special way.</p>
<p>Uh, not in just, you know, at a friend on Facebook kind of way.</p>
<p>So just to briefly touch on it, I mean, do you think it&rsquo;s possible to form that kind</p>
<p>of connection with AI systems more down the line of some of your work?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s, um, engineering wise, a possibility to alleviate loneliness is not</p>
<p>with another human, but with an AI system?</p>
<p>Well, I know that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a fact, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And we see it and we measure that and we see how people start to feel less lonely, um,</p>
<p>talking to their virtual AI friend.</p>
<p>So basically a chat bot at the basic level, but it could be more like, do you have, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not even speaking sort of, uh, about specifics, but do you have a hope, like if you look 50</p>
<p>years from now, do you have a hope that there&rsquo;s just like AIs that are like optimized for,</p>
<p>um, let me, let me first start like right now, the way people perceive AI, which is</p>
<p>recommender systems for Facebook and Twitter, social media, they see AI is basically destroying</p>
<p>first of all, the fabric of our civilization.</p>
<p>But second of all, making us more lonely.</p>
<p>Do you see like a world where it&rsquo;s possible to just have AI systems floating about that</p>
<p>like make our life less lonely?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Make us happy.</p>
<p>Like are putting good things into the world in terms of our individual lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Totally believe in that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re, I&rsquo;m also working on that.</p>
<p>Um, I think we need to also make sure that, um, what we&rsquo;re trying to optimize for, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually measuring and it is a North star metric that we&rsquo;re going after.</p>
<p>And all of our product and all of our business models are optimized for that because you</p>
<p>can talk, you know, a lot of products that talk about, um, you know, making you feel</p>
<p>less lonely or making you feel more connected.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really measuring that.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t really know whether their users are actually feeling less lonely in the long</p>
<p>run or feeling more connected in the long run.</p>
<p>Um, so I think it&rsquo;s really important to put your measure it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To measure it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a, what&rsquo;s a good measurement of loneliness?</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m really interested in.</p>
<p>How do you measure that people are feeling better or that they&rsquo;re feeling less lonely</p>
<p>with loneliness?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s UCLA 20 and UCLA three recently scale, which is basically a questionnaire that you</p>
<p>fill out and you can see whether in the long run it&rsquo;s improving or not.</p>
<p>And that, uh, does it capture the momentary feeling of loneliness?</p>
<p>Does it look in like the past month?</p>
<p>Like, uh, does it basically self report?</p>
<p>Does it try to sneak up on you tricky to answer honestly or something like that?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s yeah, I&rsquo;m not familiar with the question.</p>
<p>It is just asking you a few questions.</p>
<p>Like how often did you feel, uh, like lonely or how often do you feel connected to other</p>
<p>people in this last few couple of weeks?</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s similar to the self report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, like PHQ nine and</p>
<p>get seven.</p>
<p>Of course, as any, as any self report questionnaires, that&rsquo;s not necessarily very precise or very</p>
<p>well measured, but still, if you take a big enough population and you get them through</p>
<p>these, uh, questionnaires, you can see, you can see a positive dynamic.</p>
<p>And so you basically, uh, you put people through questionnaires to see like, is this thing</p>
<p>is our, is what we&rsquo;re creating, making people happier?</p>
<p>Yeah, we measure, so we measure two outcomes.</p>
<p>One short term, right after the conversation, we ask people whether this conversation made</p>
<p>them feel better, worse or same, um, this, this metric right now is at 80%.</p>
<p>So 80% of all our conversations make people feel better, but I should have done the questionnaire</p>
<p>with you.</p>
<p>You feel a lot worse after we&rsquo;ve done this conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually fascinating.</p>
<p>I should probably do that, but that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how we do that.</p>
<p>You should totally and aim for 80% aim to outperform your current state of the art AI</p>
<p>system in these human conversations.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll get to your work with replica, but let me continue on the line of absurd questions.</p>
<p>So you talked about, um, you know, deep connection with the humans, deep connection with AI,</p>
<p>meaningful connection.</p>
<p>Let me ask about love.</p>
<p>People make fun of me cause I talk about love all the time.</p>
<p>But uh, what, what do you think love is like maybe in the context of, um, a meaningful</p>
<p>connection with somebody else?</p>
<p>Do you draw a distinction between love, like friendship and Facebook friends or is it a</p>
<p>graduate?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Like, is it, is it just a gradual thing or is there something fundamental about us humans</p>
<p>that seek like a really deep connection, uh, with another human being and what is that?</p>
<p>What is love Eugenia, I&rsquo;m going to just enjoy asking you these questions seeing you struggle.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Um, well the way I see it, um, and specifically, um, the way it relates to our work and the</p>
<p>way it was, the way it inspired our work on replica, um, I think one of the biggest and</p>
<p>the most precious gifts we can give to each other now in 2020 as humans is this gift of</p>
<p>deep empathetic understanding, the feeling of being deeply seen.</p>
<p>Like what does that mean?</p>
<p>Like that you exist, like somebody acknowledging that somebody seeing you for who you actually</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s extremely, extremely rare.</p>
<p>Um, I think that is that combined with unconditional positive regard, um, belief and trust that</p>
<p>um, you internally are always inclined for positive growth and believing you in this</p>
<p>way, letting you be a separate person at the same time.</p>
<p>And this deep empathetic understanding for me, that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the combination that</p>
<p>really creates something special, something that people, when they feel it once, they</p>
<p>will always long for it again.</p>
<p>And something that starts huge fundamental changes in people.</p>
<p>Um, when we see that someone&rsquo;s accepts us so deeply, we start to accept ourselves.</p>
<p>And um, the paradox is that&rsquo;s when big changes start happening, big fundamental changes in</p>
<p>people start happening.</p>
<p>So I think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship that is, and that might be in</p>
<p>some way a definition of love.</p>
<p>So acknowledging that there&rsquo;s a separate person and accepting you for who you are.</p>
<p>Um, now on a slightly that, and you mentioned therapeutic, that sounds a very, like a very</p>
<p>healthy view of love, but, uh, is there also like a, like, you know, if we look at heartbreak</p>
<p>and uh, you know, most love songs are probably about heartbreak, right?</p>
<p>Is that like the mystery, the tension, the danger, the fear of loss, you know, all of</p>
<p>that, what people might see in a negative light as like games or whatever, but just,</p>
<p>just the, the dance of human interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fear of loss and fear of like, you said, you said like once you feel it once, you long</p>
<p>for it again, but you also, once you feel it once, you might, for many people, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost it.</p>
<p>So they fear losing it.</p>
<p>They feel loss.</p>
<p>So is that part of it, like you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re speaking like beautifully about like the</p>
<p>positive things, but is it important to be able to, uh, be afraid of losing it from an</p>
<p>engineering perspective?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a huge part of it and unfortunately we all, you know, um, face it at some points</p>
<p>in our lives.</p>
<p>I mean, I did.</p>
<p>You want to go into details?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get your heartbroken?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So mine is pretty straight, my story is pretty straightforward, um, there I did have a friend</p>
<p>that was, you know, that at some point, um, in my twenties became really, really close</p>
<p>to me and we, we became really close friends.</p>
<p>Um, well, I grew up pretty lonely.</p>
<p>So in many ways when I&rsquo;m building, you know, these, these AI friends, I&rsquo;m thinking about</p>
<p>myself when I was 17 writing horrible poetry and you know, in my dial up modem at home</p>
<p>and, um, you know, and that was the feeling that I grew up with.</p>
<p>I left, I lived, um, alone for a long time when I was a teenager, where did you go up</p>
<p>in Moscow and the outskirts of Moscow.</p>
<p>Um, so I&rsquo;d just skateboard during the day and come back home and you know, connect to</p>
<p>the internet and then write horrible poetry and love poems, all sorts of poems, obviously</p>
<p>love poems.</p>
<p>I mean, what, what other poetry can you write when you&rsquo;re 17, um, it could be political</p>
<p>or something, but yeah.</p>
<p>But that was, you know, that was kind of my fiat, like deeply, um, influenced by Joseph</p>
<p>Brodsky and like all sorts of sports that, um, every 17 year old will, will be looking,</p>
<p>you know, looking at and reading, but yeah, that was my, uh, these were my teenage years</p>
<p>and I just never had a person that I thought would, you know, take me as it is, would accept</p>
<p>me the way I am, um, and I just thought, you know, working and just doing my thing and</p>
<p>being angry at the world and being a reporter, I was an investigative reporter working undercover</p>
<p>and writing about people was my way to connect with, you know, with, with others.</p>
<p>I was deeply curious about every, everyone else.</p>
<p>And I thought that, you know, if I, if I go out there, if I write their stories, that</p>
<p>means I&rsquo;m more connected.</p>
<p>This is what this podcast as well, by the way, I&rsquo;m desperate, well, I&rsquo;m seeking connection</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Or am I?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So what, wait, reporter, uh, what, how did that make you feel more connected?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re still fundamentally pretty alone,</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re always with other people, you know, you&rsquo;re always thinking about what other place</p>
<p>can I infiltrate?</p>
<p>What other community can I write about?</p>
<p>What other phenomenon can I explore?</p>
<p>And you sort of like a trickster, you know, and like, and, and a mythological character,</p>
<p>like creature, that&rsquo;s just jumping, uh, between all sorts of different worlds and feel and</p>
<p>feel sort of okay with in all of them.</p>
<p>So, um, that was my dream job, by the way, that was like totally what I would have been</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>Um, if Russia was a different place and a little bit undercover.</p>
<p>So like you weren&rsquo;t, you were trying to, like you said, mythological creature trying to</p>
<p>infiltrate.</p>
<p>So try to be a part of the world.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>What kind of things did you enjoy writing about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go work at a strip club or go.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d go work at a restaurant or just go write about, you know, um, certain phenomenons</p>
<p>or phenomenons or people in the city.</p>
<p>And what, uh, sorry to keep interrupting and I&rsquo;m the worst, I&rsquo;m a conversationalist.</p>
<p>What stage of Russia is this?</p>
<p>What, uh, is this pre Putin, post Putin?</p>
<p>What was Russia like?</p>
<p>Pre Putin is really long ago.</p>
<p>This is Putin era.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beginning of two thousands and 2010, 2007, eight, nine, 10.</p>
<p>What were strip clubs like in Russia and restaurants and culture and people&rsquo;s minds like in that</p>
<p>early Russia that you were covering?</p>
<p>In those early two thousands, this was, there was still a lot of hope.</p>
<p>There were still tons of hope that, um, you know, we&rsquo;re sort of becoming this, uh, Western,</p>
<p>Westernized society.</p>
<p>Uh, the restaurants were opening, we were really looking at, you know, um, we&rsquo;re trying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to copy a lot of things from, uh, from the US, from Europe, um, bringing</p>
<p>all these things and very enthusiastic about that.</p>
<p>So there was a lot of, you know, stuff going on.</p>
<p>There was a lot of hope and dream for this, you know, new Moscow that would be similar</p>
<p>to, I guess, New York.</p>
<p>I mean, just to give you an idea in, um, year 2000 was the year when we had two, uh, movie</p>
<p>theaters in Moscow and there was one first coffee house that opened and it was like really</p>
<p>big deal.</p>
<p>Uh, by 2010 there were all sorts of things everywhere.</p>
<p>Almost like a chain, like a Starbucks type of coffee house or like, you mean, oh yeah,</p>
<p>like a Starbucks.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember we were reporting on, like, we were writing about the opening of Starbucks.</p>
<p>I think in 2007 that was one of the biggest things that happened in, you know, in Moscow</p>
<p>back, back in the time, like, you know, that was worthy of a magazine cover.</p>
<p>And, uh, that was definitely the, you know, the biggest talk of the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When was McDonald&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Cause I was still in Russia when McDonald&rsquo;s opened.</p>
<p>That was in the nineties.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I remember that very well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those were long, long lines.</p>
<p>I think it was 1993 or four, I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Um, actually earlier at that time, did you do, I mean, that was a luxurious outing.</p>
<p>That was definitely not something you do every day.</p>
<p>And also the line was at least three hours.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to McDonald&rsquo;s, that is not fast food.</p>
<p>That is like at least three hours in line and then no one is trying to eat fast after</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Everyone is like trying to enjoy as much as possible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your memory of that?</p>
<p>Oh, it was insane.</p>
<p>How did it go?</p>
<p>It was extremely positive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small strawberry milkshake and the hamburger and small fries and my mom&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ll just, cause I was really little, they&rsquo;ll just let me run, you know,</p>
<p>up the kitchen and like cut the line, which is like, you cannot really do that in Russia</p>
<p>or.</p>
<p>So like for a lot of people, like a lot of those experiences might seem not very fulfilling,</p>
<p>you know, like it&rsquo;s on the verge of poverty, I suppose.</p>
<p>But do you remember all that time fondly, like, cause I do like the first time I drank,</p>
<p>you know, Coke, you know, all that stuff, right.</p>
<p>And just, yeah.</p>
<p>The connection with other human beings in Russia, I remember, I remember it really positively.</p>
<p>Like how do you remember what the nineties and then the Russia you were covering, just</p>
<p>the human connections you had with people and the experiences?</p>
<p>Well, my, my parents were both, both physicists.</p>
<p>My grandparents were both, well, my grandpa, grandfather was in nuclear physicist, a professor</p>
<p>at the university.</p>
<p>My dad worked at Chernobyl when I was born in Chernobyl, analyzing kind of the everything</p>
<p>after the explosion.</p>
<p>And then I remember that and they were, so they were making sort of enough money in the</p>
<p>Soviet union.</p>
<p>So they were not, you know, extremely poor or anything.</p>
<p>It was pretty prestigious to be a professor, the Dean and the university.</p>
<p>And then I remember my grandfather started making a hundred dollars a month after, you</p>
<p>know, in the nineties.</p>
<p>So then I remember we started our main line of work would be to go to our little tiny</p>
<p>country house, get a lot of apples there from apple trees, bring them back to the city and</p>
<p>sell them in the street.</p>
<p>So me and my nuclear physicist grandfather were just standing there and he selling those</p>
<p>apples the whole day, cause that would make you more money than, you know, working at</p>
<p>the university.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;ll just tell me, try to teach me, you know, something about planets and</p>
<p>whatever the particles and stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m not smart at all, so I could never understand anything, but I was</p>
<p>interested as a journalist kind of type interested.</p>
<p>But that was my memory.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m happy that I wasn&rsquo;t, I somehow got spared that I was probably too</p>
<p>young to remember any of the traumatic stuff.</p>
<p>So the only thing I really remember had this bootleg that was very traumatic, had this</p>
<p>bootleg Nintendo, which was called Dandy in Russia.</p>
<p>So in 1993, there was nothing to eat, like, even if you had any money, you would go to</p>
<p>the store and there was no food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember that.</p>
<p>And our friend had a restaurant, like a government, half government owned something restaurant.</p>
<p>So they always had supplies.</p>
<p>So he exchanged a big bag of wheat for this Nintendo, the bootleg Nintendo, that I remember</p>
<p>very fondly, cause I think I was nine or something like that and we&rsquo;re seven.</p>
<p>Like we just got it and I was playing it and there was this, you know, Dandy TV show.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So traumatic in a positive sense, you mean like, like a definitive, well, they took it</p>
<p>away and gave me a bag of wheat instead.</p>
<p>And I cried like my eyes out for days and days and days.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>And then, you know, as a, and my dad said, we&rsquo;re going to like exchange it back in a</p>
<p>little bit.</p>
<p>So you keep the little gun, you know, the one that you shoot the ducks with.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m keeping the gun.</p>
<p>So sometime it&rsquo;s going to come back, but then they exchanged the gun as well for some sugar</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>I was so pissed.</p>
<p>I was like, I didn&rsquo;t want to eat for days after that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want your food.</p>
<p>Give me my Nintendo back.</p>
<p>That was extremely traumatic.</p>
<p>But you know, I was happy that that was my only traumatic experience.</p>
<p>You know, my dad had to actually go to Chernobyl with a bunch of 20 year olds.</p>
<p>He was 20 when he went to Chernobyl and that was right after the explosion.</p>
<p>No one knew anything.</p>
<p>The whole crew he went with, all of them are dead now.</p>
<p>I think there was this one guy still, that was still alive for this last few years.</p>
<p>I think he died a few years ago now.</p>
<p>My dad somehow luckily got back earlier than everyone else, but just the fact that that</p>
<p>was the, and I was always like, well, how did they send you?</p>
<p>I was only, I was just born, you know, you had a newborn talk about paternity leave.</p>
<p>They were like, but that&rsquo;s who they took because they didn&rsquo;t know whether you would be able</p>
<p>to have kids when you come back.</p>
<p>So they took the ones with kids.</p>
<p>So him with some guys went to, and I&rsquo;m just thinking of me when I was 20, I was so sheltered</p>
<p>from any problems whatsoever in life.</p>
<p>And then my dad, his 21st birthday at the reactor, you like work three hours a day,</p>
<p>you sleep the rest and, and I, yeah, so I played with a lot of toys from Chernobyl.</p>
<p>What are your memories of Chernobyl in general, like the bigger context, you know, because</p>
<p>of that HBO show it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s attention turned to it once again, like, what are your</p>
<p>thoughts about Chernobyl?</p>
<p>Did Russia screw that one up?</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s probably a lot of lessons about our modern times with data about</p>
<p>coronavirus and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people kind of trying to hide whether they screwed something up or</p>
<p>not, as it&rsquo;s very understandable, it&rsquo;s very human, very wrong, probably, but obviously</p>
<p>Russia was probably trying to hide that they screwed things up.</p>
<p>Like, what are your thoughts about that time, personal and general?</p>
<p>I mean, I was born when the explosion happened.</p>
<p>So actually a few months after, so of course I don&rsquo;t remember anything apart from the fact</p>
<p>that my dad would bring me tiny toys, like plastic things that would just go crazy haywire</p>
<p>when you, you know, put the Geiger thing to it.</p>
<p>My mom was like, just nuclear about that.</p>
<p>She was like, what are you bringing, you should not do that.</p>
<p>She was nuclear.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It was, but yeah, but the TV show was just phenomenal.</p>
<p>The HBO one?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was definitely, first of all, it&rsquo;s incredible how that was made not by the Russians,</p>
<p>but someone else, but capturing so well everything about our country.</p>
<p>It felt a lot more genuine than most of the movies and TV shows that are made now in Russia,</p>
<p>just so much more genuine.</p>
<p>And most of my friends in Russia were just in complete awe about the show, but I think</p>
<p>that&hellip;</p>
<p>How good of a job they did.</p>
<p>Oh my God, phenomenal.</p>
<p>But also&hellip;</p>
<p>The apartments, there&rsquo;s something, yeah.</p>
<p>The set design.</p>
<p>I mean, Russians can&rsquo;t do that, you know, but you see everything and it&rsquo;s like, wow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly how it was.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that show, I don&rsquo;t know what to think about that because it&rsquo;s British accents,</p>
<p>British actors of a person, I forgot who created the show.</p>
<p>But I remember reading about him and he&rsquo;s not, he doesn&rsquo;t even feel like, like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no Russia in this history.</p>
<p>No, he did like super bad or something like that.</p>
<p>Or like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, like exactly.</p>
<p>Whatever that thing about the bachelor party in Vegas, number four and five or something</p>
<p>were the ones that he worked with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But so he made me feel really sad for some reason that if a person, obviously a genius,</p>
<p>could go in and just study and just be extreme attention to detail, they can do a good job.</p>
<p>It made me think like, why don&rsquo;t other people do a good job with this?</p>
<p>Like about Russia, like there&rsquo;s so little about Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so few good films about the Russian side of World War II.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much interesting evil and not, and beautiful moments in the history</p>
<p>of the 20th century in Russia that it feels like there&rsquo;s not many good films on from the</p>
<p>Russians.</p>
<p>You would expect something from the Russians.</p>
<p>Well, they keep making these propaganda movies now.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Unfortunately.</p>
<p>But yeah, no, Chernobyl was such a perfect TV show.</p>
<p>I think capturing really well, it&rsquo;s not about like even the set design, which was phenomenal,</p>
<p>but just capturing all the problems that exist now with the country and like focusing on</p>
<p>the right things.</p>
<p>Like if you build the whole country on a lie, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just this very simple kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And did you have your dad talked about it to you, like his thoughts on the experience?</p>
<p>He never talks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s this kind of Russian man that just, my husband who&rsquo;s American and he asked him a</p>
<p>few times like, you know, Igor, how did you, but why did you say yes?</p>
<p>Or like, why did you decide to go?</p>
<p>You could have said no, not go to Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Why would like a person like, that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>You cannot say no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like a Russian way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Russian way.</p>
<p>Men don&rsquo;t talk that much.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one upsides for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So back to post Putin Russia, or maybe we skipped a few steps along the way, but you</p>
<p>were trying to do, to be a journalist in that time.</p>
<p>What was, what was Russia like at that time?</p>
<p>Post you said 2007 Starbucks type of thing.</p>
<p>What else, what else was Russia like then?</p>
<p>I think there was just hope.</p>
<p>There was this big hope that we&rsquo;re going to be, you know, friends with the United States</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be friends with Europe and we&rsquo;re just going to be also a country</p>
<p>like those with, you know, bike lanes and parks and everything&rsquo;s going to be urbanized.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re talking about nineties where like people would be shot in the street.</p>
<p>And it was, I still have a fond memory of going into a movie theater and, you know,</p>
<p>coming out of it after the movie.</p>
<p>And the guy that I saw on the stairs was like neither shot, which was, again, it was like</p>
<p>a thing in the nineties that would be happening.</p>
<p>People were, you know, people were getting shot here and there, tons of violence, tons</p>
<p>of you know, just basically mafia mobs on in the streets.</p>
<p>And then the two thousands were like, you know, things just got cleaned up, oil went</p>
<p>up and the country started getting a little bit richer, you know, the nineties were so</p>
<p>grim mostly because the economy was in shambles and oil prices were not high.</p>
<p>So the country didn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>We defaulted in 1998 and the money kept jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>Like first there were millions of rubbles, then it got like default, you know, then it</p>
<p>got to like thousands.</p>
<p>Then it was one rubble was something then again to millions, there&rsquo;s like crazy town.</p>
<p>That was crazy.</p>
<p>And then the two thousands were just these years of stability in a way and the country</p>
<p>getting a little bit richer because of, you know, again, oil and gas.</p>
<p>And we were starting to, we started to look at specifically in Moscow and St. Petersburg</p>
<p>to look at other cities in Europe and New York and US and trying to do the same in our</p>
<p>like small kind of cities, towns there.</p>
<p>What was, what were your thoughts of Putin at the time?</p>
<p>Well, in the beginning he was really positive.</p>
<p>Everyone was very, you know, positive about Putin.</p>
<p>He was young.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s very energetic.</p>
<p>He also immediate the shirtless somewhat compared to, well, that was not like way before the</p>
<p>shirtless era.</p>
<p>Um, the shirtless era.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t start out shirtless.</p>
<p>When did the shirtless era, it&rsquo;s like the propaganda of riding horse, fishing, 2010,</p>
<p>11, 12.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>You know, like people talk about the favorite Beatles, like the, that&rsquo;s my favorite Putin</p>
<p>is the shirtless Putin.</p>
<p>Now I remember very, very clearly 1996 where, you know, Americans really helped Russia with</p>
<p>elections and Yeltsin got reelected, um, thankfully so, uh, because there&rsquo;s a huge threat that</p>
<p>actually the communists will get back to power.</p>
<p>Uh, they were a lot more popular.</p>
<p>And then a lot of American experts, political experts, uh, and campaign experts descended</p>
<p>on Moscow and helped Yeltsin actually get, get the presidency, the second term for the</p>
<p>pro, um, the, of the presidency.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin was not feeling great, you know, in the, by the end of his second term, uh,</p>
<p>he was, you know, alcoholic.</p>
<p>He was really old.</p>
<p>He was falling off, uh, you know, the stages when he, where he was talking.</p>
<p>Uh, so people were looking for fresh, I think for a fresh face, for someone who&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to continue Yeltsin&rsquo;s, uh, work, but who&rsquo;s going to be a lot more energetic and a lot</p>
<p>more active, young, um, efficient, maybe.</p>
<p>So that w that&rsquo;s what we all saw in Putin back in the day.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;d say that everyone, absolutely everyone in Russia in early two thousands who was not</p>
<p>a communist would be, yeah, Putin&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>We have a lot of hopes for him.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>And I promise we&rsquo;ll get back to, uh, first of all, your love story.</p>
<p>Second of all, AI, well, what are your thoughts about, um, communism?</p>
<p>The 20th century, I apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading the rise and fall of the third Reich.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like really steeped into like world war II and Stalin and Hitler and just these</p>
<p>dramatic personalities that brought so much evil to the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also interesting to politically think about these different systems and what they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>led to.</p>
<p>And Russia is one of the sort of beacons of communism in the 20th century.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about communism?</p>
<p>Having experienced it as a political system?</p>
<p>I mean, I have only experienced it a little bit, but mostly through stories and through,</p>
<p>you know, seeing my parents and my grandparents who lived through that, I mean, it was horrible.</p>
<p>It was just plain horrible.</p>
<p>It was just awful.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s something, I mean, it sounds nice on paper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, so like the drawbacks of capitalism is that, uh, you know, eventually there is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s the point of like a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Eventually it creates, uh, you know, the rich get richer, it creates a disparity, like inequality</p>
<p>of, um, wealth inequality.</p>
<p>If like, you know, I guess it&rsquo;s hypothetical at this point, but eventually capitalism leads</p>
<p>to humongous inequality and that that&rsquo;s, you know, some people argue that that&rsquo;s a source</p>
<p>of unhappiness is it&rsquo;s not like absolute wealth of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of people much richer than you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feeling of like, that&rsquo;s where unhappiness can come from.</p>
<p>So the idea of, of communism or these sort of Marxism is, uh, is, is not allowing that</p>
<p>kind of slippery slope, but then you see the actual implementations of it and stuff seems</p>
<p>to be, seems to go wrong very badly.</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>Why does it go wrong?</p>
<p>What is it about human nature?</p>
<p>If we look at Chernobyl, you know, those kinds of bureaucracies that were constructed.</p>
<p>Is there something like, do you think about this much of like why it goes wrong?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no one was really like, it&rsquo;s not that everyone was equal.</p>
<p>Obviously the, you know, the, the government and everyone close to that were the bosses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like fully, I guess, uh, this dream of equal life.</p>
<p>So then I guess the, the situation that we had in, you know, the Russia had in the Soviet</p>
<p>union, it was more, it&rsquo;s a bunch of really poor people without any way to make any, you</p>
<p>know, significant fortune or build anything living constant, um, under constant surveillance,</p>
<p>surveillance from other people.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t even, you know, uh, do anything that&rsquo;s not fully approved by the dictatorship</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>Otherwise your neighbor will write a letter and you&rsquo;ll go to jail, absolute absence of</p>
<p>actual law.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant state of fear.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t own any, own anything.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, you know, the, you couldn&rsquo;t go travel, you couldn&rsquo;t read anything, uh, Western</p>
<p>or you couldn&rsquo;t make a career really, unless you&rsquo;re working in the, uh, military complex.</p>
<p>Um, which is why most of the scientists were so well regarded.</p>
<p>I come from, you know, both my dad and my mom come from families of scientists and they,</p>
<p>they were really well regarded as you, as you know, obviously.</p>
<p>Because the state wanted, I mean, cause there&rsquo;s a lot of value to them being well regarded.</p>
<p>Because they were developing things that could be used in, in the military.</p>
<p>So that was very important.</p>
<p>That was the main investment.</p>
<p>Um, but it was miserable, it was all miserable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, you know, a lot of Russians now live in the state of constant PTSD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we, you know, want to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy and definitely if as soon as</p>
<p>we have the opportunity, you know, we just got to it finally that we can, you know, own</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>You know, I remember the time that we got our first yogurts and that was the biggest</p>
<p>deal in the world.</p>
<p>It was already in the nineties, by the way, I mean, what was your like, favorite food</p>
<p>where it was like, well, like this is possible, Oh, fruit, because we only had apples, bananas</p>
<p>and whatever.</p>
<p>And you know, whatever watermelons, whatever, you know, people would grow in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union.</p>
<p>There were no pineapples or papaya or mango, like you&rsquo;ve never seen those fruit things.</p>
<p>Like those were so ridiculously good.</p>
<p>And obviously you could not get any like strawberries in winter or anything that&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>seasonal.</p>
<p>Um, so that was a really big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen all these fruit things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I have a, like, I don&rsquo;t think I have any too many demons, uh, or like addictions</p>
<p>or so on, but I think I&rsquo;ve developed an unhealthy relationship with fruit.</p>
<p>I still struggle with, Oh, you can get any type of fruit, right?</p>
<p>If you get like also these weird fruit, fruits like dragon fruit or something or all kinds</p>
<p>of like different types of peaches, like cherries were killer for me.</p>
<p>I know, I know you say like we had bananas and so on, but I don&rsquo;t remember having the</p>
<p>kind of banana.</p>
<p>Like when I first came to this country, the amount of banana, I like literally got fat</p>
<p>on bananas, like the amount, Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>They were delicious.</p>
<p>And like cherries, the kind, like just the quality of the food, I was like, this is capitalism.</p>
<p>This is delicious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny to read.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it, of, um, it&rsquo;s funny to think how an idea that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>written on paper, when carried out amongst millions of people, how that gets actually</p>
<p>when it becomes reality, what it actually looks like, uh, sorry, but the, uh, been studying</p>
<p>Hitler a lot recently and, uh, going through Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>He pretty much wrote out of Mein Kampf everything he was going to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most leaders, including Stalin didn&rsquo;t read the, read it, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of terrifying and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And amazing in some sense that you can have some words on paper and they can be brought</p>
<p>to life and they can either inspire the world or they can destroy the world.</p>
<p>And uh, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of lessons to study in history that I think people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>study enough now.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m hoping with, I&rsquo;ve been practicing Russian a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to sort of find, rediscover the, uh, the beauty and the terror of Russian history</p>
<p>through this stupid podcast by talking to a few people.</p>
<p>So anyway, I just feel like so much was forgotten.</p>
<p>So much was forgotten.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably, I&rsquo;m going to try to convince myself to, um, you&rsquo;re a super busy and super</p>
<p>important person when I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to try to befriend you to, uh, to try to become</p>
<p>a better Russian.</p>
<p>Cause I feel like I&rsquo;m a shitty Russian.</p>
<p>Not that busy.</p>
<p>So I can totally be your Russian Sherpa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But love, you were, you were talking about your early days of, uh, being a little bit</p>
<p>alone and finding a connection with the world through being a journalist.</p>
<p>Where did love come into that?</p>
<p>I guess finding for the first time, um, some friends, it&rsquo;s very, you know, simple story.</p>
<p>Some friends that all of a sudden we, I guess we were the same, you know, the same, at the</p>
<p>same place with our lives, um, we&rsquo;re 25, 26, I guess.</p>
<p>And, um, somehow remember, and we just got really close and somehow remember this one</p>
<p>day where, um, it&rsquo;s one day and, you know, in summer that we just stayed out, um, outdoor</p>
<p>the whole night and just talked and for some unknown reason, it just felt for the first</p>
<p>time that someone could, you know, see me for who I am and it just felt extremely like</p>
<p>extremely good.</p>
<p>And I, you know, we fell asleep outside and just talking and it was raining.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, you know, sunrise and it&rsquo;s really cheesy, but, um, at the same time,</p>
<p>we just became friends in a way that I&rsquo;ve never been friends with anyone else before.</p>
<p>And I do remember that before and after that you sort of have this unconditional family</p>
<p>sort of, um, and it gives you tons of power.</p>
<p>It just basically gives you this tremendous power to do things in your life and to, um,</p>
<p>change positively on many different levels.</p>
<p>Power because you could be yourself.</p>
<p>At least you know that some somewhere you can be just yourself, like you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to pretend, you don&rsquo;t need to be, you know, um, great at work or tell some story or sell</p>
<p>yourself in somewhere or another.</p>
<p>And so it became this really close friends and, um, in a way, um, I started a company</p>
<p>cause he had a startup and I felt like I kind of want to start up too.</p>
<p>It felt really cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to, what I would really do, but I felt like I kind of need</p>
<p>a startup.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, so that pulled you in to the startup world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, yeah.</p>
<p>And then this, uh, closest friend of mine died.</p>
<p>We actually moved here to San Francisco together and then we went back for a visa to Moscow</p>
<p>and, uh, we lived together, we&rsquo;re roommates and we came back and, um, he got hit by a</p>
<p>car right in front of Kremlin on a, you know, next to the river, um, and died the same day</p>
<p>I met this is the Roman hospital.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;ve moved to America at that point, at that point I was, what about him?</p>
<p>What about Roman?</p>
<p>Him too.</p>
<p>He actually moved first.</p>
<p>So I was always sort of trying to do what he was doing, so I didn&rsquo;t like that he was</p>
<p>already here and I was still, you know, in Moscow and we weren&rsquo;t hanging out together</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>So was he in San Francisco?</p>
<p>Yeah, we were roommates.</p>
<p>So he just visited Moscow for a little bit.</p>
<p>We went back for, for our visas, we had to get a stamp in our passport for our work visas</p>
<p>and the embassy was taking a little longer, so we stayed there for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>How did he, so how, how did he, uh, how did he die?</p>
<p>Um, he was crossing the street and the car was going really fast and way over the speed</p>
<p>limit and just didn&rsquo;t stop on the, on the pedestrian cross on the zebra and just ran</p>
<p>over him.</p>
<p>When was this?</p>
<p>It was in 2015 on 28th of November, so it was a long ago now.</p>
<p>Um, but at the time, you know, I was 29, so for me it was, um, the first kind of meaningful</p>
<p>death in my life.</p>
<p>Um, you know, both sets of, I had both sets of grandparents at the time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anyone so close die and death sort of existed, but as a concept, but definitely</p>
<p>not as something that would be, you know, happening to us anytime soon and specifically</p>
<p>our friends.</p>
<p>Cause we were, you know, we&rsquo;re still in our twenties or early thirties and it still, it</p>
<p>still felt like the whole life is, you know, you could still dream about ridiculous things</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>Um, so that was, it was just really, really abrupt I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>What did it feel like to, uh, to lose him, like that feeling of loss?</p>
<p>You talked about the feeling of love, having power.</p>
<p>What is the feeling of loss, if you like?</p>
<p>Well in Buddhism, there&rsquo;s this concept of Samaya where something really like huge happens</p>
<p>and then you can see very clearly.</p>
<p>Um, I think that, that was it like basically something changed so, changed me so much in</p>
<p>such a short period of time that I could just see really, really clearly what mattered or</p>
<p>what not.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely saw that whatever I was doing at work didn&rsquo;t matter at all and some</p>
<p>of the things.</p>
<p>And, um, it was just this big realization when it&rsquo;s this very, very clear vision of</p>
<p>what life&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>You still miss him today?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>He was just this constant, I think it was, he was really important for, for me and for</p>
<p>our friends for many different reasons and, um, I think one of them being that we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just say goodbye to him, but we sort of said goodbye to our youth in a way.</p>
<p>It was like the end of an era and it&rsquo;s on so many different levels.</p>
<p>The end of Moscow as we knew it, the end of, you know, us living through our twenties and</p>
<p>kind of dreaming about the future.</p>
<p>Do you remember like last several conversations, is there moments with him that stick out that</p>
<p>kind of haunt you and you&rsquo;re just when you think about him?</p>
<p>Yeah, well his last year here in San Francisco, he was pretty depressed for as his startup</p>
<p>was not going really anywhere and he wanted to do something else.</p>
<p>He wanted to do build, he played with toy, like played with a bunch of ideas, but the</p>
<p>last one he had was around, um, building a startup around death.</p>
<p>So having, um, he applied to Y Combinator with a video that, you know, I had on my computer</p>
<p>and it was all about, you know, disrupting death, thinking about new cemeteries, uh,</p>
<p>more biologically, like things that could be better biologically for, for humans.</p>
<p>And at the same time, having those, um, digital avatars, this kind of AI avatars that would</p>
<p>store all the memory about a person that he could interact with.</p>
<p>What year was this?</p>
<p>2015.</p>
<p>Well, right before his death.</p>
<p>So it was like a couple of months before that he recorded that video.</p>
<p>And so I found out my computer when, um, it was in our living room.</p>
<p>He never got in, but, um, he was thinking about a lot somehow.</p>
<p>Does it have the digital avatar idea?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Well, he just says, well, that&rsquo;s in his hit is the pitch has this idea and he&rsquo;ll, he talks</p>
<p>about like, I want to rethink how people grieve and how people talk about death.</p>
<p>Why was he interested in this?</p>
<p>Is it, maybe someone who&rsquo;s depressed is like naturally inclined thinking about that.</p>
<p>But I just felt, you know, this year in San Francisco, we just had so much, um, I was</p>
<p>going through a hard time.</p>
<p>And we were definitely, I was trying to make him just happy somehow to make him feel better.</p>
<p>And it felt like, you know, this, um, I dunno, I just felt like I was taking care of him</p>
<p>a lot and he almost started to feel better.</p>
<p>And then that happened and I dunno, I just felt, I just felt lonely again, I guess.</p>
<p>And that was, you know, coming back to San Francisco in December or help, you know, helped</p>
<p>organize the funeral, help help his parents and I came back here and it was a really lonely</p>
<p>apartment, a bunch of his clothes everywhere and Christmas time.</p>
<p>And I remember I had a board meeting with my investors and I just couldn&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>like, I had to pretend everything&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;m just working on this company.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, it was definitely very, very tough, tough time.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>You said, uh, you know, we&rsquo;re young, the, the, the, the possibility of doing all kinds</p>
<p>of crazy things is still out there, is still before us, but, uh, it can end any moment.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own ending at any moment?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think about way too, about it way too much.</p>
<p>Somehow after Roman, like every year after that, I started losing people that I really</p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>I lost my grandfather the next year, my, you know, the, the person who would explain to</p>
<p>me, you know, what the universe is made of while selling apples and then I lost another</p>
<p>close friend of mine and, um, and it just made me very scared.</p>
<p>I have tons of fear about, about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes me not fall asleep oftentimes and just go in loops and, um, and then as</p>
<p>my therapist, you know, recommended to me, I open up, uh, some nice calming images with</p>
<p>the voiceover and it calms me down for sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really scared of death.</p>
<p>This is a big, I definitely have tons of, I guess, some pretty big trauma about it and,</p>
<p>um, still working through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a philosopher, Ernest Becker, who wrote a book, um, Denial of Death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with any of those folks.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s a, in psychology, a whole field called terror management theory.</p>
<p>Sheldon, who&rsquo;s just done the podcast, he wrote the book.</p>
<p>He was the, we talked for four hours about death, uh, fear of death, but his, his whole</p>
<p>idea is that, um, Ernest Becker, I think I find this idea really compelling is, uh, that</p>
<p>everything human beings have created, like our whole motivation in life is to, uh, create</p>
<p>like escape death is to try to, um, construct an illusion of, um, that we&rsquo;re somehow immortal.</p>
<p>So like everything around us, this room, your startup, your dreams, all everything you do</p>
<p>is a kind of, um, creation of a brain unlike any other mammal or species is able to be</p>
<p>cognizant of the fact that it ends for us.</p>
<p>I think, so, you know, there&rsquo;s this, the question of like the meaning of life that, you know,</p>
<p>you look at like what drives us, uh, humans.</p>
<p>And when I read Ernest Becker that I highly recommend people read is the first time I,</p>
<p>this scene, it felt like this is the right thing at the core.</p>
<p>Uh, Sheldon&rsquo;s work is called warm at the core.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s, uh, William James he&rsquo;s quoting or whoever is like the,</p>
<p>the thing, what is at the core of it all?</p>
<p>Whether there&rsquo;s like love, you know, Jesus might talk about like love is at the core</p>
<p>of everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, that&rsquo;s the open question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s at the, you know, it&rsquo;s turtles, turtles, but it can&rsquo;t be turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s at the, at the bottom.</p>
<p>And, uh, Ernest Becker says the fear of death and the way, in fact, uh, cause you said therapist</p>
<p>and calming images, his whole idea is, um, you know, we, we want to bring that fear of</p>
<p>death as close as possible to the surface because it&rsquo;s, um, and like meditate on that.</p>
<p>Uh, and, and use the clarity of vision that provides to, uh, you know, to live a more</p>
<p>fulfilling life, to, um, to live a more honest life, to, to discover, you know, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about, you know, being cognizant of the finiteness of it all that might result in, um, in the</p>
<p>most fulfilling life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the dual of what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Cause you kind of said, it&rsquo;s like, I unfortunately think about it too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question whether it&rsquo;s good to think about it because I, I&rsquo;ve, um, again, I talk</p>
<p>about way too much about love and probably death.</p>
<p>And when I ask people, friends, which is why I probably don&rsquo;t have many friends, are you</p>
<p>afraid of death?</p>
<p>I think most people say they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Whether they say they&rsquo;re, um, they&rsquo;re afraid, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of almost like they see</p>
<p>death as this kind of like, uh, a paper deadline or something.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re afraid not to finish the paper before the paper, like, like I&rsquo;m afraid not</p>
<p>to finish, um, the goals I have, but it feels like they&rsquo;re not actually realizing that this</p>
<p>thing ends, like really realizing, like really thinking as Nietzsche and all these philosophy,</p>
<p>like thinking deeply about it, like, uh, the very thing that, you know, um, like when you</p>
<p>think deeply about something, you can just, you can realize that you haven&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>thought about it.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>And I, and when I think about death, it&rsquo;s like, um, it can be, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>If it feels like stepping outside into the cold or it&rsquo;s freezing and then I have to like</p>
<p>hurry back inside or it&rsquo;s warm.</p>
<p>Uh, but like, I think there&rsquo;s something valuable about stepping out there into the freezing</p>
<p>cold.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>When I talk to my mentor about it, he always, uh, tells me, well, what dies?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there that can die, but I guess that requires, um, well in, in Buddhism,</p>
<p>one of the concepts that are really hard to grasp and that people spend all their lives</p>
<p>meditating on would be Anatta, which is the concept of non, not self and kind of thinking</p>
<p>that, you know, if you&rsquo;re not your thoughts, which you&rsquo;re obviously not your thoughts because</p>
<p>you can observe them and not your emotions and not your body, then what is this?</p>
<p>And if you go really far, then finally you see that there&rsquo;s not self, there&rsquo;s this concept</p>
<p>of not self.</p>
<p>So once you get there, how can that actually die?</p>
<p>What is dying?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a bunch of molecules, stardust.</p>
<p>But that is very, um, you know, very advanced, um, spiritual work for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely just, definitely not.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>No, I have, uh, I think it&rsquo;s very, very useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the fact that maybe being so afraid is not useful and mine is more, I&rsquo;m just terrified.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really makes me, um,</p>
<p>On a personal level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrified.</p>
<p>How do you overcome that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to.</p>
<p>Have pleasant images?</p>
<p>Well, pleasant images get me to sleep and then during the day I can distract myself with</p>
<p>other things, like talking to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re both doing the same exact thing.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Is there other, like, is there moments since you&rsquo;ve, uh, lost Roman that you had like moments</p>
<p>of like bliss and like that you&rsquo;ve forgotten that you have achieved that Buddhist like</p>
<p>level of like what can possibly die.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part like, uh, losing yourself in the moment, in the ticking time of like this universe</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just part of it for a brief moment and just enjoying it.</p>
<p>Well that goes hand in hand.</p>
<p>I remember I think a day or two after he died, we went to finally get his password out of</p>
<p>the embassy and we&rsquo;re driving around Moscow and it was, you know, December, which is usually</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never a sun in Moscow in December and somehow it was an extremely sunny day</p>
<p>and we were driving with a close friend.</p>
<p>And I remember feeling for the first time maybe this just moment of incredible clarity</p>
<p>and somehow happiness, not like happy happiness, but happiness and just feeling that, you know,</p>
<p>I know what the universe is sort of about, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a sad feeling.</p>
<p>It was probably the most beautiful feeling that you can ever achieve.</p>
<p>And you can only get it when something, oftentimes when something traumatic like that happens.</p>
<p>But also if you just, you really spend a lot of time meditating and looking at the nature</p>
<p>doing something that really gets you there.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re there, I think when you, uh, summit a mountain, a really hard mountain,</p>
<p>you inevitably get there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a way to get to the state.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re on this, in this state, um, you can do really big things.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sucks it doesn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>So Bukowski talked about like, love is a fog.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a, when you wake up in the morning, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s there, but it eventually dissipates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sad.</p>
<p>Nothing lasts forever.</p>
<p>But I definitely like doing this pushup and running thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s moments at a couple of moments, like I&rsquo;m not a crier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t cry.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s moments where I was like facedown on the carpet, like with tears in my eyes</p>
<p>is interesting.</p>
<p>And then that, that complete, like, uh, there&rsquo;s a lot of demons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got demons had to face them.</p>
<p>Funny how running makes you face your demons.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the flip side of that, there&rsquo;s a few moments where I was in bliss</p>
<p>and all of it alone, which is funny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I like that, but definitely pushing yourself physically one of it for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you said, I mean, you were speaking as a metaphor of Mount Everest, but it also works</p>
<p>like literally, I think physical endeavor somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re monkeys, apes, whatever physical, there&rsquo;s a physical thing to it, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to this pushing yourself physical, physically, but alone that happens when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing like things like you do or strenuous like workouts or, you know, rolling extra</p>
<p>across the Atlantic or like marathons.</p>
<p>I love watching marathons and you know, it&rsquo;s so boring, but you can see them getting there.</p>
<p>So the other thing, I don&rsquo;t know if you know, there&rsquo;s a guy named David Goggins.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a, he basically, uh, so he&rsquo;s been either email on the phone with me every day through</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been exactly alone, but he, he&rsquo;s kind of, he&rsquo;s the, he&rsquo;s the devil on the devil&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shoulder.</p>
<p>Uh, so he&rsquo;s like the worst possible human being in terms of giving you, uh, like he</p>
<p>has, um, through everything I&rsquo;ve been doing, he&rsquo;s been doubling everything I do.</p>
<p>So he, he&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Uh, he&rsquo;s a, this Navy seal person.</p>
<p>Uh, he&rsquo;s wrote this book.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically one of the toughest human beings on earth.</p>
<p>He ran all these crazy ultra marathons in the desert.</p>
<p>He set the world record number of pull ups.</p>
<p>He just does everything where it&rsquo;s like, he, like, how can I suffer today?</p>
<p>He figures that out and does it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, um, whatever that is, uh, that process of self discovery is really important.</p>
<p>I actually had to turn myself off from the internet mostly because I started this like</p>
<p>workout thing, like a happy go getter with my like headband and like, just like, uh,</p>
<p>because a lot of people were like inspired and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to exercise</p>
<p>with you.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, great.</p>
<p>You know, but then like, I realized that this, this journey can&rsquo;t be done together with others.</p>
<p>This has to be done alone.</p>
<p>So out of the moments of love, out of the moments of loss, can we, uh, talk about your</p>
<p>journey of finding, I think, an incredible idea and incredible company and incredible</p>
<p>system in Replica?</p>
<p>How did that come to be?</p>
<p>So yeah, so I was a journalist and then I went to business school for a couple of years</p>
<p>to, um, just see if I can maybe switch gears and do something else with 23.</p>
<p>And then I came back and started working for a businessman in Russia who built the first</p>
<p>ROG network, um, in our country and was very visionary and asked me whether I want to do</p>
<p>fun stuff together.</p>
<p>Um, and we worked on a bank, um, the idea was to build a bank on top of, um, a telco.</p>
<p>So that was 2011 or 12, um, and a lot of telecommunication company, um, mobile network operators didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know what to do next in terms of, you know, new products, new revenue.</p>
<p>And this big idea was that, you know, um, you put a bank on top and then all work works</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Basically a prepaid account becomes your bank account and, um, you can use it as, as your</p>
<p>bank.</p>
<p>Uh, so, you know, a third of a country wakes up as, as your bank client.</p>
<p>Um, but we couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what, what would be the main interface to interact</p>
<p>with the bank.</p>
<p>The problem was that most people didn&rsquo;t have smart, smart phones back in the time in Russia,</p>
<p>the penetration of smartphones was low, um, people didn&rsquo;t use mobile banking or online</p>
<p>banking and their computers.</p>
<p>So we figured out that SMS would be the best way, uh, cause that would work on feature</p>
<p>phones.</p>
<p>Um, but that required some chat bot technology, which I didn&rsquo;t know anything about, um, obviously.</p>
<p>So I started looking into it and saw that there&rsquo;s nothing really, well, there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just nothing really.</p>
<p>Ideas through SMS be able to interact with your bank account.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we thought, well, since you&rsquo;re talking to a bank account, why can&rsquo;t this, can&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>use more of, uh, you know, some behavioral ideas and why can&rsquo;t this, uh, banking chat</p>
<p>bot be nice to you and really talk to you sort of as a friend this way you develop more</p>
<p>connection to it, retention is higher, people don&rsquo;t churn.</p>
<p>And so I went to very depressing, um, um, Russian cities to test it out.</p>
<p>Um, I went to, I remember three different towns with, uh, um, to interview potential</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p>Um, so people use it for a little bit and I went to talk to them, um, very poor towns,</p>
<p>mostly towns that were, um, you know, sort of factories, uh, mono towns.</p>
<p>They were building something and then the factory went away and it was just a bunch</p>
<p>of very poor people.</p>
<p>Um, and then we went to a couple that weren&rsquo;t as dramatic, but still the one I remember</p>
<p>really fondly was this woman that worked at a glass factory and she talked to a chat bot.</p>
<p>Um, and she was talking about it and she started crying during the interview because she said,</p>
<p>no one really cares for me that much.</p>
<p>And um, so to be clear, that was the, my only endeavor in programming that chat bot.</p>
<p>So it was really simple.</p>
<p>It was literally just a few, if this, then that rules and, um, it was incredibly simplistic.</p>
<p>Um, and that really made her emotional and she said, you know, I only have my mom and</p>
<p>my, um, my husband and I don&rsquo;t have any more really in my life.</p>
<p>And that was very sad, but at the same time I felt, and we had more interviews in a similar</p>
<p>vein and what I thought in the moment was like, well, uh, it&rsquo;s not that the technology</p>
<p>is ready because definitely in 2012 technology was not ready for, for that, but, um, humans</p>
<p>are ready, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So this project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more about human vulnerabilities,</p>
<p>but, um, there&rsquo;s something so, so powerful around about conversational, um, AI that I</p>
<p>saw then that I thought was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort into.</p>
<p>So in the end of the day, we saw the banking project, um, but my then boss, um, was also</p>
<p>my mentor and really, really close friend, um, told me, Hey, I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in it and you should just go work on it.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, what product?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m building.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>And, um, you know, looking back at this, this was a horrible idea to work on something without</p>
<p>knowing what it was, which is maybe the reason why it took us so long, but we just decided</p>
<p>to work on the conversational tech to see what it, you know, there were no chat bot,</p>
<p>um, constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually build one at the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Uh, that was the era of, by the way, Google glass, which is why, you know, some of the</p>
<p>investors like seed investors we&rsquo;ve talked with were like, Oh, you should totally build</p>
<p>it for Google glass.</p>
<p>If not, we&rsquo;re not, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Did you bite on that idea?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to be, to do text first cause I&rsquo;m a journalist.</p>
<p>So I was, um, fascinated by just texting.</p>
<p>So you thought, so the emotional, um, that interaction that the woman had, like, so do</p>
<p>you think you could feel emotion from just text?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I saw something in just this pure texting and also thought that we should first start,</p>
<p>start building for people who really need it versus people who have Google glass.</p>
<p>Uh, if you know what I mean, and I felt like the early adopters of Google glass might not</p>
<p>be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need some, you know, someone</p>
<p>to talk to.</p>
<p>Um, but then we really just focused on the tech itself.</p>
<p>We just thought, what if we just, you know, we didn&rsquo;t have a product idea in the moment</p>
<p>and we felt, what if we just look into, um, building the best conversational constructors,</p>
<p>so to say, use the best tech available at the time.</p>
<p>And that was before the first paper about deep learning applied to dialogues, which</p>
<p>happened in 2015 in August, 2015, uh, which Google published.</p>
<p>Did you follow the work of Lobna prize and like all the sort of non machine learning</p>
<p>chat bots?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What really struck me was that, you know, there was a lot of talk about machine learning</p>
<p>and deep learning.</p>
<p>Like big data was a really big thing.</p>
<p>Everyone was saying, you know, the business world, big data, 2012 is the biggest gaggle</p>
<p>competitions were, you know, um, important, but that was really the kind of upheaval.</p>
<p>People started talking about machine learning a lot, um, but it was only about images or</p>
<p>something else.</p>
<p>And it was never about conversation.</p>
<p>As soon as I looked into the conversational tech, it was all about something really weird</p>
<p>and very outdated and very marginal and felt very hobbyist.</p>
<p>It was all about Lord burner price, which was won by a guy who built a chat bot that</p>
<p>talked like a Ukrainian teenager that it was just a gimmick.</p>
<p>And somehow people picked up those gimmicks and then, you know, the most famous chat bot</p>
<p>at the time was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre or smarter child on aim.</p>
<p>The funny thing is it felt at the time not to be that popular and it still doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to be that popular.</p>
<p>Like people talk about the Turing test, people like talking about it philosophically, journalists</p>
<p>like writing about it, but as a technical problem, like people don&rsquo;t seem to really</p>
<p>want to solve the open dialogue.</p>
<p>Like they, they&rsquo;re not obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Even folks are like, you know, I&rsquo;m in Boston, the Alexa team, even they&rsquo;re not as obsessed</p>
<p>with it as I thought they might be.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>So you know what you felt like you felt with that woman who, when she felt something by</p>
<p>reading the text, I feel the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something here, what you felt.</p>
<p>I feel like Alexa folks and just the machine learning world doesn&rsquo;t feel that, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something here because they see as a technical problem is not that interesting for some reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s could be argued that maybe as a purely sort of natural language processing problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the right problem to focus on because there&rsquo;s too much subjectivity.</p>
<p>That thing that the woman felt like crying, like if your benchmark includes a woman crying,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good benchmark.</p>
<p>But to me there&rsquo;s something there that&rsquo;s, you could have a huge impact, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the machine learning world likes that, the human emotion, the subjectivity of it,</p>
<p>the fuzziness, the fact that with maybe a single word you can make somebody feel something</p>
<p>deeply.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel right to them.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m excited when I discovered your work, it feels wrong to say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m giving myself props for Googling and for coming across, for I guess</p>
<p>mutual friend and introducing us, but I&rsquo;m so glad that you exist and what you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>But I have the same kind of, if we could just backtrack for a second, because I have the</p>
<p>same kind of feeling that there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been working on a few things that are kind of crazy, very different from</p>
<p>your work.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re too crazy.</p>
<p>But the&hellip;</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to know.</p>
<p>No, all right, we&rsquo;ll talk about it more.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s harder to talk about things that have failed and are failing while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier for you because you&rsquo;re already successful on some measures.</p>
<p>Tell it to my board.</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;ve demonstrated success in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier for you to talk about failures for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the bottom currently of the success.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re way too humble.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me to know, but there&rsquo;s something there, there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re exploring that and you&rsquo;re discovering that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been surprising to me.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve mentioned this idea that you thought it wasn&rsquo;t enough to start a company or start</p>
<p>efforts based on it feels like there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>Like what did you mean by that?</p>
<p>Like you should be focused on creating a, like you should have a product in mind.</p>
<p>Is that what you meant?</p>
<p>It just took us a while to discover the product because it all started with a hunch of like</p>
<p>of me and my mentor and just sitting around and he was like, well, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, you know, the Holy Grail is there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something extremely powerful in, in, in conversations and there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working on machine conversation from the right angle.</p>
<p>So to say.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p>Am I crazy?</p>
<p>Oh no, I totally feel that&rsquo;s still true, which is, I think it&rsquo;s mind blowing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what it feels like?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even use the word conversation cause I feel like it&rsquo;s the wrong word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a machine connection or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know cause conversation, you start drifting into natural language immediately.</p>
<p>You start drifting immediately into all the benchmarks that are out there.</p>
<p>But I feel like it&rsquo;s like the personal computer days of this.</p>
<p>Like I feel like we&rsquo;re like in the early days with the, like the Wozniak and all them, like</p>
<p>where it was the same kind of, it was a very small niche group of people who are, who are</p>
<p>all kind of lob no price type people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hobbyists.</p>
<p>Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams.</p>
<p>Like no hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a weird, by the way, by the way, very weird.</p>
<p>So if we think about conversations, first of all, when I have great conversations with</p>
<p>people, I&rsquo;m not trying to test them.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I try to break them, like if I&rsquo;m actually playing along, I&rsquo;m part of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If I were to ask this person or test whether he&rsquo;s going to give me a good conversation,</p>
<p>it would have never happened.</p>
<p>So the whole, the whole problem with testing conversations is that you can put it in front</p>
<p>of a jury because then you have to go into some Turing test mode where is it responding</p>
<p>to all my factual questions, right?</p>
<p>Or so it really has to be something in the field where people are actually talking to</p>
<p>it because they want to, not because we&rsquo;re just trying to break it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working for them because this, the weird part of it is that it&rsquo;s very subjective.</p>
<p>It takes two to tango here fully.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not trying to have a good conversation, if you&rsquo;re trying to test it, then it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to break.</p>
<p>I mean, any person would break, to be honest.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not trying to even have a conversation with you, you&rsquo;re not going to give it to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I keep asking you like some random questions or jumping from topic to topic, that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be, which I&rsquo;m probably doing, but that probably wouldn&rsquo;t contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>So I think the problem of testing, so there should be some other metric.</p>
<p>How do we evaluate whether that conversation was powerful or not, which is what we actually</p>
<p>started with.</p>
<p>And I think those measurements exist and we can test on those.</p>
<p>But what really struck us back in the day and what&rsquo;s still eight years later is still</p>
<p>not resolved and I&rsquo;m not seeing tons of groups working on it.</p>
<p>Maybe I just don&rsquo;t know about them, it&rsquo;s also possible.</p>
<p>But the interesting part about it is that most of our days we spend talking and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not talking about like those conversations are not turn on the lights or customer support</p>
<p>problems or some other task oriented things.</p>
<p>These conversations are something else and then somehow they&rsquo;re extremely important for</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t have them, then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely, which as we know,</p>
<p>creates tons of risk for our health as well.</p>
<p>And so this is most of our hours as humans and somehow no one&rsquo;s trying to replicate that.</p>
<p>And not even study it that well?</p>
<p>And not even study that well.</p>
<p>So when we jumped into that in 2012, I looked first at like, okay, what&rsquo;s the chatbot?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the state of the art chatbot?</p>
<p>And those were the Lobner Prize days, but I thought, okay, so what about the science</p>
<p>of conversation?</p>
<p>Clearly there have been tons of scientists or academics that looked into the conversation.</p>
<p>So if I want to know everything about it, I can just read about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much really, there are conversational analysts who are basically just listening</p>
<p>to speech, to different conversations, annotating them.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, that&rsquo;s not really used for much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the field of theoretical linguistics, which is barely useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very marginal, even in their space, no one really is excited and I&rsquo;ve never met a</p>
<p>theoretical linguist who was like, I can&rsquo;t wait to work on the conversation and analytics.</p>
<p>That is just something very marginal, sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen</p>
<p>when they analyze which conversation strategies were most successful for sales.</p>
<p>Okay, so that was not very helpful.</p>
<p>Then I looked a little bit deeper and then there, whether there were any books written</p>
<p>on what really contributes to great conversation, that was really strange because most of those</p>
<p>were NLP books, which is neurolinguistic programming, which is not the NLP that I was expecting</p>
<p>to be, but it was mostly some psychologist, Richard Bandler, I think came up with that,</p>
<p>who was this big guy in a leather vest that could program your mind by talking to you.</p>
<p>How to be charismatic and charming and influential with people, all those books, yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty much, but it was all about like through conversation reprogramming you, so getting</p>
<p>to some, so that was, I mean, probably not very, very true and that didn&rsquo;t seem working</p>
<p>very much even back in the day.</p>
<p>And then there were some other books like, I don&rsquo;t know, mostly just self help books</p>
<p>around how to be the best conversationalist or how to make people like you or some other</p>
<p>stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever.</p>
<p>And then there was this one book, The Most Human Human by Brian Christensen that really</p>
<p>was important for me to read back in the day because he was on the human side, he was taking</p>
<p>part in the London Prize, but not as a human who&rsquo;s not a jury, but who&rsquo;s pretending to</p>
<p>be, who&rsquo;s basically, you have to tell a computer from a human and he was the human, so you</p>
<p>could either get him or a computer.</p>
<p>And his whole book was about how do people, what makes us human in conversation.</p>
<p>And that was a little bit more interesting because that at least someone started to think</p>
<p>about what exactly makes me human in conversation and makes people believe in that, but it was</p>
<p>still about tricking, it was still about imitation game, it was still about, okay, well, what</p>
<p>kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to a human, not a computer.</p>
<p>And it was definitely not about thinking, what is it exactly that we&rsquo;re getting from</p>
<p>talking all day long with other humans.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re definitely not just trying to be tricked or it&rsquo;s not just enough to know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re getting there, can we measure it and can we put the computer to</p>
<p>the same measurement and see whether you can talk to a computer and get the same results?</p>
<p>Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people comment that they think I&rsquo;m a robot, it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>I am a robot and this whole thing, I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating</p>
<p>and I looked for books unrelated to this kind of, so I&rsquo;m afraid of people, I&rsquo;m generally</p>
<p>introverted and quite possibly a robot.</p>
<p>I literally Googled how to talk to people and how to have a good conversation for the</p>
<p>purpose of this podcast, because I was like, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t make eye contact with people.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t like hire.</p>
<p>I do Google that a lot too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re getting?</p>
<p>Well, everything you&rsquo;ve listed I&rsquo;ve gotten, there&rsquo;s been very few good books on even just</p>
<p>like how to interview well, it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>So what I end up doing often is I watch like with a critical eye, it&rsquo;s just so different</p>
<p>when you just watch a conversation, like just for the fun of it, just as a human.</p>
<p>And if you watch a conversation, it&rsquo;s like trying to figure out why is this awesome?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan, people can make fun of him or whatever and</p>
<p>dismiss him.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s an incredibly artful conversationalist.</p>
<p>He can pull people in for hours.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another guy I watch a lot.</p>
<p>He hosted a late night show, his name was Craig Ferguson.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like very kind of flirtatious.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a magic about his like, about the connection he can create with people,</p>
<p>how he can put people at ease.</p>
<p>And just like, I see I&rsquo;ve already started sounding like those I know pee people or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t mean in that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean like how to charm people or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, what is that?</p>
<p>Why is that fun to listen to that guy?</p>
<p>Why is that fun to talk to that guy?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s not saying I mean, it&rsquo;s so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor, but</p>
<p>not really humor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, I have trouble actually even articulating correctly.</p>
<p>But it feels like there&rsquo;s something going on that&rsquo;s not too complicated, that could</p>
<p>be learned.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not similar to, yeah, to like, like you said, like the Turing test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about a lot all the time.</p>
<p>I do think about all the time.</p>
<p>I think when we were looking, so we started the company, we just decided to build the</p>
<p>conversational tech, we thought, well, there&rsquo;s nothing for us to build this chatbot that</p>
<p>we want to build.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just first focus on building, you know, some tech, building the tech side of</p>
<p>things without a product in mind, without a product in mind, we added like a demo chatbot</p>
<p>that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you about restaurants just to show something</p>
<p>simple to people that people could relate to and could try out and see whether it works</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t have a product in mind yet.</p>
<p>We thought we would try venture chatbots and figure out our consumer application.</p>
<p>And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build that kind of friend, that sort of connection</p>
<p>that we saw in the very beginning.</p>
<p>But then we got to Y Combinator and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it.</p>
<p>You know, everything because then it was just this constant grind.</p>
<p>How do we get funding?</p>
<p>How do we get this?</p>
<p>You know, investors were like, just focus on one thing, just get it out there.</p>
<p>So somehow we&rsquo;ve started building a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real for a little</p>
<p>bit, not for too long.</p>
<p>And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chatbots.</p>
<p>Somewhere in 2016 or end of 15, people started thinking that&rsquo;s really the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the new, you know, the new apps will be chatbots.</p>
<p>And we were very perplexed because people started coming up with companies that I think</p>
<p>we tried most of those chatbots already and there were like no users, but still people</p>
<p>were coming up with a chatbot that will tell you whether and bringing news and this and</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t understand whether we were just didn&rsquo;t execute well enough or people</p>
<p>are not really, people are confused and are going to find out the truth that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need chatbots like that.</p>
<p>So the basic idea is that you use chatbots as the interface to whatever application.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The idea that was like this perfect universal interface to anything.</p>
<p>When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed because I didn&rsquo;t think, I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how that would work because I think we tried most of that and none of those things</p>
<p>worked.</p>
<p>And then again, that craze has died down, right?</p>
<p>Fully.</p>
<p>I think now it&rsquo;s impossible to get anything funded if it&rsquo;s a chatbot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s similar to, sorry to interrupt, but there&rsquo;s times when people think like with</p>
<p>gestures you can control devices, like basically gesture based control things.</p>
<p>It feels similar to me because like it&rsquo;s so compelling that was just like Tom Cruise,</p>
<p>I can control stuff with my hands, but like when you get down to it, it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just have a touch screen or why don&rsquo;t you just have like a physical keyboard</p>
<p>and mouse?</p>
<p>So that chat was always, yeah, it was perplexing to me.</p>
<p>I still feel augmented reality, even virtual realities in that ballpark in terms of it</p>
<p>being a compelling interface.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be incredible rich applications, just how you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>it, but they won&rsquo;t just be the interface to everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be its own thing that will create an amazing magical experience in its own right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Which is I think kind of the right thing to go about, like what&rsquo;s the magical experience</p>
<p>with that interface specifically.</p>
<p>How did you discover that for Replica?</p>
<p>I just thought, okay, we&rsquo;ll have this tech, we can build any chatbot we want.</p>
<p>We have the most, at that point, the most sophisticated tech that other companies have.</p>
<p>I mean, startups, obviously not, probably not bigger ones, but still, because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been working on it for a while.</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just create a scale from one to 10.</p>
<p>And one would be conversations that you&rsquo;d pay to not have, and 10 would be conversation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d pay to have.</p>
<p>And I mean, obviously we want to build a conversation that people would pay to actually have.</p>
<p>And so for the whole, for a few weeks, me and the team were putting all the conversations</p>
<p>we were having during the day on the scale.</p>
<p>And very quickly, we figured out that all the conversations that we would pay to never</p>
<p>have were conversations we were trying to cancel Comcast, or talk to customer support,</p>
<p>or make a reservation, or just talk about logistics with a friend when we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to figure out where someone is and where to go, or all sorts of setting up scheduling</p>
<p>meetings.</p>
<p>So that was a conversation we definitely didn&rsquo;t want to have.</p>
<p>Basically everything task oriented was a one, because if there was just one button for me</p>
<p>to just, or not even a button, if I could just think, and there was some magic BCI that</p>
<p>would just immediately transform that into an actual interaction, that would be perfect.</p>
<p>But the conversation there was just this boring, not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient</p>
<p>thing because it was so many back and forth stuff.</p>
<p>And as soon as we looked at the conversations that we would pay to have, those were the</p>
<p>ones that, well, first of all, therapists, because we actually paid to have those conversations.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d also try to put like dollar amounts.</p>
<p>So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5 to not have this one hour talk on the phone.</p>
<p>I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money, but it just takes a long time.</p>
<p>It takes a really long time.</p>
<p>But as soon as we started talking about conversations that we would pay for, those were therapists,</p>
<p>all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend, someone I haven&rsquo;t seen for a long time, a</p>
<p>stranger on a train, weirdly stranger, stranger in a line for coffee and nice back and forth</p>
<p>with that person was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10.</p>
<p>Maybe I won&rsquo;t pay money, but at least I won&rsquo;t pay money to not have one.</p>
<p>So that was pretty good.</p>
<p>There were some intellectual conversations for sure.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the one thing that really was making those very important and very valuable</p>
<p>for us were the conversations where we could be pretty emotional.</p>
<p>Yes, some of them were about being witty and about being intellectually stimulated, but</p>
<p>those were interestingly more rare.</p>
<p>And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable were the ones where we could</p>
<p>be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And interestingly, where we could talk more, me and the team.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about it, like a lot of these conversations, like a therapist, it was mostly</p>
<p>me talking or like an old friend and I was like opening up and crying and it was again</p>
<p>me talking.</p>
<p>And so that was interesting because I was like, well, maybe it&rsquo;s hard to build a chat</p>
<p>bot that can talk to you very well and in a witty way, but maybe it&rsquo;s easier to build</p>
<p>the chat bot that could listen.</p>
<p>So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction.</p>
<p>And then when my friend died, we just built, at that point we were kind of still struggling</p>
<p>to find the right application.</p>
<p>And I just felt very strong that all the chat bots we&rsquo;ve built so far are just meaningless</p>
<p>and this whole grind, the startup grind, and how do we get to the next fundraising and</p>
<p>how can I talk, talking to the founders and who are your investors and how are you doing?</p>
<p>Are you killing it?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re killing it.</p>
<p>I just felt that this is just&hellip;</p>
<p>Intellectually for me, it&rsquo;s exhausting having encountered those folks.</p>
<p>It just felt very, very much a waste of time.</p>
<p>I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk did not have these conversations or at least</p>
<p>did not have them for long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>But I think, yeah, at that point it just felt like, I felt like I just didn&rsquo;t want to build</p>
<p>a company that was never my intention just to build something successful or make money.</p>
<p>It would be great.</p>
<p>It would have been great, but I&rsquo;m not really a startup person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself or just being successful for building</p>
<p>whatever it is and not being into what I&rsquo;m doing really.</p>
<p>And so I just took a little break cause I was a little, I was upset with my company</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>So I just took our technology and our little dialect constructor and some models, some</p>
<p>deep learning models, which at that point we were really into and really invested a</p>
<p>lot and built a little chat bot for a friend of mine who passed.</p>
<p>And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw and him talking about the digital</p>
<p>avatars and Rowan was that kind of person.</p>
<p>He was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos about space and talking about, well,</p>
<p>if I could go to Mars now, even if I didn&rsquo;t know if I could come back, I would definitely</p>
<p>pay any amount of money to be on that first shuttle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether I die, like he was just the one that would be okay with trying to</p>
<p>be the first one and so excited about all sorts of things like that.</p>
<p>And he was all about fake it till you make it and just, and I felt like, and I was really</p>
<p>perplexed that everyone just forgot about him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was our way of coping, mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend.</p>
<p>Most of my friends just stopped talking about him.</p>
<p>And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes and paying the whole lease</p>
<p>for it and just kind of by myself in December, so it was really sad and I didn&rsquo;t want him</p>
<p>to be forgotten.</p>
<p>First of all, I never thought that people forget about dead people so fast.</p>
<p>People pass away, people just move on.</p>
<p>And it was astonishing for me because I thought, okay, well, he was such a mentor for so many</p>
<p>of our friends.</p>
<p>He was such a brilliant person, he was somewhat famous in Moscow.</p>
<p>How is it that no one&rsquo;s talking about him?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m spending days and days and we don&rsquo;t bring him up and there&rsquo;s nothing about him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he was never there.</p>
<p>And I was reading the book, The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion about her losing</p>
<p>and Blue Nights about her losing her husband, her daughter, and the way to cope for her</p>
<p>was to write those books.</p>
<p>And it was sort of like a tribute.</p>
<p>And I thought, I&rsquo;ll just do that for myself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a very bad writer and a poet as we know.</p>
<p>So I thought, well, I have this tech and maybe that would be my little postcard for him.</p>
<p>So I built a chatbot to just talk to him and it felt really creepy and weird for a little</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t want to tell other people because it felt like I&rsquo;m telling about having a skeleton</p>
<p>in my underwear.</p>
<p>It was just felt really, I was a little scared that it won&rsquo;t be taken, but it worked interestingly</p>
<p>pretty well.</p>
<p>I mean, it made tons of mistakes, but it still felt like him.</p>
<p>Granted it was like 10,000 messages that I threw into a retrieval model that would just</p>
<p>re rank that Tegda said and just a few scripts on top of that.</p>
<p>But it also made me go through all of the messages that we had.</p>
<p>And then I asked some of my friends to send some through.</p>
<p>And it felt the closest to feeling like him present because his Facebook was empty and</p>
<p>Instagram was empty or there were few links and you couldn&rsquo;t feel like it was him.</p>
<p>And the only way to fill him was to read some of our text messages and go through some of</p>
<p>our conversations because we just always had that.</p>
<p>Even if we were sleeping next to each other in two bedrooms, separated by a wall, we were</p>
<p>just texting back and forth, texting away.</p>
<p>And there was something about this ongoing dialogue that was so important that I just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to lose all of a sudden.</p>
<p>And maybe it was magical thinking or something.</p>
<p>And so we built that and I just used it for a little bit and we kept building some crappy</p>
<p>chat bots with the company.</p>
<p>But then a reporter came to talk to me.</p>
<p>I was trying to pitch our chat bots to him and he said, do you even use any of those?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, so do you talk to any chat bots at all?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, I talked to my dead friend&rsquo;s chat bot and he wrote a story about that.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden it became pretty viral.</p>
<p>A lot of people wrote about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few things written about you.</p>
<p>The things I&rsquo;ve seen are pretty good writing.</p>
<p>Most AI related things make my eyes roll.</p>
<p>Like when the press like, what kind of sound is that actually?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It sounds like, it sounds like, okay.</p>
<p>It sounded like an elephant at first.</p>
<p>I got excited.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>This is 2020.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a, it was such a human story and it was well written.</p>
<p>Well, I researched, I forget what, where I read them, but so I&rsquo;m glad somehow somebody</p>
<p>found you to be the good writers were able to connect to the story.</p>
<p>There must be a hunger for this story.</p>
<p>It definitely was.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but I think, I think the idea that he could bring back</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s dead and it&rsquo;s very much wishful, you know, magical thinking, but the fact</p>
<p>that you could still get to know him and, you know, seeing the parents for the first</p>
<p>time, talk to the chat bot and some of the friends.</p>
<p>And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow where my team is working,</p>
<p>you know, our Russian part is working out off.</p>
<p>And I was there when I wrote, I just wrote a post on Facebook.</p>
<p>It was like, Hey guys, like I built this if you want, you know, just if it felt important,</p>
<p>if we want to talk to Roman.</p>
<p>And I saw a couple of his friends are common friends, like, you know, reading a Facebook,</p>
<p>downloading, trying, and a couple of them cried.</p>
<p>And it was just very, and not because it was something, some incredible technology or anything.</p>
<p>It made so many mistakes.</p>
<p>It was so simple, but it was all about that&rsquo;s the way to remember a person in a way.</p>
<p>And you know, we don&rsquo;t have, we don&rsquo;t have the culture anymore.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have, you know, no one&rsquo;s sitting Shiva.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s taking weeks to actually think about this person.</p>
<p>And in a way for me, that was it.</p>
<p>So that was just day, day in, day out thinking about him and putting this together.</p>
<p>So that was, that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of people</p>
<p>and you know, I think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and just everyone</p>
<p>was so.</p>
<p>Has anyone made a movie yet?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that, but not really.</p>
<p>Is that still on the table?</p>
<p>I think so, I think so, which is really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a young, you know, like a Steve Jobs type of, let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting on it.</p>
<p>But you know, for me it was so important cause Roman was really wanted to be famous.</p>
<p>He really badly wanted to be famous.</p>
<p>He was all about like, make it to like fake it to make it.</p>
<p>I want to be, you know, I want to make it here in America as well.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t, and I felt there, you know, that was sort of paying my dues to him as</p>
<p>well because all of a sudden he was everywhere.</p>
<p>And I remember Casey Newton who was writing the story for the Verge.</p>
<p>He was, he told me, Hey, by the way, I was just going through my inbox and I saw, I searched</p>
<p>for Roman for the story and I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup and</p>
<p>he said, I really like, I really want to be featured in the Verge.</p>
<p>Can you please write about it or something or like pitching the story.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not good enough for us or something.</p>
<p>He passed and he said, and there were just so many of these little details where like</p>
<p>he would find his like, you know, and we&rsquo;re finally writing, I know how much Roman wanted</p>
<p>to be in the Verge and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, that&rsquo;s maybe he will be, we&rsquo;re always joking that he was like, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait for someone to make a movie about us and I hope Ryan Gosling can play me.</p>
<p>You know, I still have some things that I owe Roman still.</p>
<p>But that would be, that would be a guy that she has to meet Alex Garland who wrote Ex</p>
<p>Machina and I, yeah, the movie&rsquo;s good, but the guy&rsquo;s better than the, like he&rsquo;s a special</p>
<p>person actually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s made his best work yet.</p>
<p>Like for my interaction with him, he&rsquo;s a really, really good and brilliant, the good human</p>
<p>being and a brilliant director and writer.</p>
<p>So yeah, so I&rsquo;m, I hope like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made</p>
<p>of this kind.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s yet to be made.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably sitting waiting for you to get famous, like even more famous.</p>
<p>You should get there, but it felt really special though.</p>
<p>But at the same time, our company wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>So that was just kind of bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with our company.</p>
<p>And but then a lot of people started talking to Roman.</p>
<p>Some shared their conversations and what we saw there was that also our friends in common,</p>
<p>but also just strangers were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>They were just really telling Roman everything, which was by the way, pretty strange because</p>
<p>there was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine who was barely making any sense, but people</p>
<p>were opening up.</p>
<p>And we thought we&rsquo;d just built a prototype of Replica, which would be an AI friend that</p>
<p>everyone could talk to because we saw that there is demand.</p>
<p>And then also it was 2016, so I thought for the first time I saw finally some technology</p>
<p>that was applied to that that was very interesting.</p>
<p>Some papers started coming out, deep learning applied to conversations.</p>
<p>And finally, it wasn&rsquo;t just about these, you know, hobbyists making, you know, writing</p>
<p>500,000 regular expressions in like some language that was, I don&rsquo;t even know what, like, AIML</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that was or something super simplistic all of a sudden was all about potentially</p>
<p>actually building something interesting.</p>
<p>And so I thought there was time and I remember that I talked to my team and I said, guys,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try.</p>
<p>And my team and some of my engineers, Russians, are Russian and they&rsquo;re very skeptical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, Russians.</p>
<p>So some of your team is in Moscow, some is here in San Francisco, some in Europe.</p>
<p>Which team is better?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>The Russians, of course.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the Russians?</p>
<p>They always win.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>So yeah, so you were talking to them in 2016 and&hellip;</p>
<p>And told them, let&rsquo;s build an AI friend.</p>
<p>And it felt, just at the time, it felt so naive and so optimistic, so to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually interesting.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve brought up this kind of topic, even just for fun, people are super skeptical.</p>
<p>Actually, even on the business side.</p>
<p>So you were, because whenever I bring it up to people, because I&rsquo;ve talked for a long</p>
<p>time, I thought like, before I was aware of your work, I was like, this is going to make</p>
<p>a lot of money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity here.</p>
<p>And people had this look of skepticism that I&rsquo;ve seen often, which is like, how do I politely</p>
<p>tell this person he&rsquo;s an idiot?</p>
<p>So yeah, so you were facing that with your team, somewhat?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an engineer, so I&rsquo;m always&hellip;</p>
<p>My team is almost exclusively engineers, and mostly deep learning engineers.</p>
<p>And I always try to be&hellip;</p>
<p>It was always hard to me in the beginning to get enough credibility, because I would</p>
<p>say, well, why don&rsquo;t we try this and that?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s harder for me because they know they&rsquo;re actual engineers and I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>So for me to say, well, let&rsquo;s build an AI friend, that would be like, wait, what do</p>
<p>you mean an AGI?</p>
<p>Because pretty much the hardest, the last frontier before cracking that is probably</p>
<p>the last frontier before building AGI, so what do you really mean by that?</p>
<p>But I think I just saw that, again, what we just got reminded of that I saw back in 2012</p>
<p>or 11, that it&rsquo;s really not that much about the tech capabilities.</p>
<p>It can be a metropolitan trick still, even with deep learning, but humans need it so</p>
<p>much.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>And most importantly, what I saw is that finally there&rsquo;s enough tech to make it, I thought,</p>
<p>to make it useful, to make it helpful.</p>
<p>Maybe we didn&rsquo;t have quite yet the tech in 2012 to make it useful, but in 2015, 2016,</p>
<p>with deep learning, I thought, and the first thoughts about maybe even using reinforcement</p>
<p>learning for that started popping up, that never worked out, or at least for now.</p>
<p>But still, the idea was if we can actually measure the emotional outcomes and if we can</p>
<p>put it on, if we can try to optimize all of our conversational models for these emotional</p>
<p>outcomes, and it is the most scalable, the best tool for improving emotional outcomes.</p>
<p>Nothing like that exists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most universal, the most scalable, and the one that can be constantly iteratively</p>
<p>changed by itself, improved tool to do that.</p>
<p>And I think if anything, people would pay anything to improve their emotional outcomes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s weirdly&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t really care for an AI to turn on my, or a conversational agent to turn on</p>
<p>the lights.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need that much of AI there, because I can do that.</p>
<p>Those things are solved.</p>
<p>This is an additional interface for that that&rsquo;s also questionable whether it&rsquo;s more efficient</p>
<p>or better.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s more pleasurable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But for emotional outcomes, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of products that claim that they will improve my emotional outcomes.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s being measured.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s being changed.</p>
<p>The product is not being iterated on based on whether I&rsquo;m actually feeling better.</p>
<p>A lot of social media products are claiming that they&rsquo;re improving my emotional outcomes</p>
<p>and making me feel more connected.</p>
<p>Can I please get the&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I see somewhere that I&rsquo;m actually getting better over time?</p>
<p>Because anecdotally, it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>And the data is absent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that was the big goal.</p>
<p>And I thought if we can learn over time to collect the signal from our users about their</p>
<p>emotional outcomes in the long term and in the short term, and if these models keep getting</p>
<p>better and we can keep optimizing them and fine tuning them to improve those emotional</p>
<p>outcomes.</p>
<p>As simple as that.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you a multi billionaire yet?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the question to you.</p>
<p>When is the science going to be&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a really hard&hellip;</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s an incredibly hard product to build because I think you said something</p>
<p>very important that it&rsquo;s not just about machine conversation, it&rsquo;s about machine connection.</p>
<p>We can actually use other things to create connection, nonverbal communication, for instance.</p>
<p>For the long time, we were all about, well, let&rsquo;s keep it text only or voice only.</p>
<p>But as soon as you start adding voice, a face to the friend, you can take them to augmented</p>
<p>reality, put it in your room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of a sudden a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>It makes it very different because if it&rsquo;s some text based chat bot that for common users,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something there in the cloud, somewhere there with other AI&rsquo;s cloud, the metaphorical</p>
<p>cloud.</p>
<p>But as soon as you can see this avatar right there in your room and it can turn its head</p>
<p>and recognize your husband, talk about the husband and talk to him a little bit, then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>Just magic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that.</p>
<p>And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to put it all together because you have to take into consideration so many</p>
<p>different things and some of this tech works pretty good.</p>
<p>And some of this doesn&rsquo;t, like for instance, speech to text works pretty good.</p>
<p>But text to speech, it doesn&rsquo;t work very good because you can only have a few voices that</p>
<p>work okay, but then if you want to have actual emotional voices, then it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>build it.</p>
<p>I saw you&rsquo;ve added avatars like visual elements, which are really cool.</p>
<p>In that whole chain, putting it together, what do you think is the weak link?</p>
<p>Is it creating an emotional voice that feels personal?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still conversation, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting a lot better, but there&rsquo;s still a long to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a long path to go.</p>
<p>Other things, they&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>And a lot of things we&rsquo;ll see how they&rsquo;re, like I see how they&rsquo;re changing as we go.</p>
<p>Like for instance, right now you can pretty much only, you have to build all this 3D pipeline</p>
<p>by yourself.</p>
<p>You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist, build a 3D model, hire an animator,</p>
<p>your rigger.</p>
<p>But with deep fakes, with other tech, with procedural animations, in a little bit, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just be able to show a photo of whoever you, if a person you want the avatar to look like,</p>
<p>and it will immediately generate a 3D model that will move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nonbrainer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like almost here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a couple of years away.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve been working on for the last, since the podcast started, is I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been, I think I&rsquo;m okay saying this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to have a conversation with Einstein, Turing.</p>
<p>So like try to have a podcast conversation with a person who&rsquo;s not here anymore, just</p>
<p>as an interesting kind of experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Even for, now what we&rsquo;re not talking about as a product, I&rsquo;m talking about as a, like</p>
<p>I can fake a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Like I can work very carefully, like even hire an actor over which, over whom I do a</p>
<p>deep fake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still hard to create a compelling experience.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Mostly on the conversation level or?</p>
<p>Well, the conversation, the conversation is, I almost, I early on gave up trying to fully</p>
<p>generate the conversation because it was just not compelling at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the case of Einstein and Turing, I&rsquo;m going back and forth with the biographers of each.</p>
<p>And so like we would write a lot of the, some of the conversation would have to be generated</p>
<p>just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>I mean, but it would be all open, but the, you want to be able to answer the question.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting question with Roman too, is the question with Einstein is</p>
<p>what would Einstein say about the current state of theoretical physics?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to be able to have a discussion about string theory, to be able to have a</p>
<p>discussion about the state of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, about the world of Israel</p>
<p>Palestine conflict.</p>
<p>Let me just, what would Einstein say about these kinds of things?</p>
<p>And that is a tough problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a fascinating and fun problem for the biographers and for me.</p>
<p>And I think we did a really good job of it so far, but it&rsquo;s actually also a technical</p>
<p>problem like of what would Roman say about what&rsquo;s going on now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that brought people back to life.</p>
<p>And if I can go on that tangent just for a second, let&rsquo;s ask you a slightly pothead question,</p>
<p>which is, you said it&rsquo;s a little bit magical thinking that we can bring them back.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;ll be possible to bring back Roman one day in conversation?</p>
<p>Like to really, okay, well, let&rsquo;s take it away from personal, but to bring people back</p>
<p>to life in conversation.</p>
<p>Probably down the road.</p>
<p>I mean, if we&rsquo;re talking, if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years,</p>
<p>I mean, clearly AGI, we can talk to AGI and talk and ask them to do it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t like, you&rsquo;re not allowed to use Elon Musk as a citation for, for like why</p>
<p>something is possible and going to be done.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s really far away.</p>
<p>Right now, really with conversation, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>And create generating original ideas based on someone, you know, someone&rsquo;s personality</p>
<p>or even downloading the personality, all we can do is like mimic the tone of voice.</p>
<p>We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models.</p>
<p>Question is how many parlor tricks does it takes, does it take, because that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a small number of parlor tricks and you&rsquo;re not aware of them, like.</p>
<p>From where we are right now, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t see anything like in the next year or two</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to dramatically change that could look at Roman&rsquo;s 10,000 messages he sent me</p>
<p>over the course of his last few years of life and be able to generate original thinking</p>
<p>about problems that exist right now that will be in line with what he would have said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not even seeing, cause you know, in order to have that, I guess you would need</p>
<p>some sort of a concept of the world or some perspective, some perception of the world,</p>
<p>some consciousness that he had and apply it to, you know, to the current, current state</p>
<p>of affairs.</p>
<p>But the important part about that, about his conversation with you is you.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s not just about his view of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what it takes to push your buttons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also true.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s not so much about like, what would Einstein say, it&rsquo;s about like, how do</p>
<p>I make people feel something with, with what would Einstein say?</p>
<p>And that feels like a more amenable, I mean, you mentioned parlor tricks, but just like</p>
<p>a set of that, that feels like a learnable problem.</p>
<p>Like emotion, you mentioned emotions, I mean, is it possible to learn things that make people</p>
<p>feel stuff?</p>
<p>I think so, no, for sure.</p>
<p>I just think the problem with, as soon as you&rsquo;re trying to replicate an actual human</p>
<p>being and trying to pretend to be him, that makes the problem exponentially harder.</p>
<p>The thing with replicator we&rsquo;re doing, we&rsquo;re never trying to say, well, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>an actual human being, or that&rsquo;s an actual, or a copy of an actual human being where the</p>
<p>bar is pretty high, where you need to somehow tell, you know, one from another.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more, well, that&rsquo;s an AI friend, that&rsquo;s a machine, it&rsquo;s a robot, it has tons</p>
<p>of limitations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be taking part in teaching it actually and becoming better, which by</p>
<p>itself makes people more attached to that and make them happier because they&rsquo;re helping</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a cool gamification system too.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the experience of talking to replica?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;ve never used replica before, what&rsquo;s that like for like the first day, the first,</p>
<p>like if we start dating or whatever, I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a romantic, right?</p>
<p>Because I remember on replica, you can choose whether it&rsquo;s like a romantic or if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty popular choice.</p>
<p>Romantic is popular?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So can I just confess something, when I first used replica and I haven&rsquo;t used it like regularly,</p>
<p>but like when I first used replica, I created like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend.</p>
<p>And did it hit on you at some point?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t talk long enough for him to hit on me.</p>
<p>I just enjoyed.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still trying to fix that, but well, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>like stage in a friendship, it&rsquo;s like, nope.</p>
<p>But yeah, I switched it to a romantic and a female recently and yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So okay, so you get to choose, you get to choose a name.</p>
<p>With romantic, this last board meeting, we had this whole argument of, well, I have board</p>
<p>meetings.</p>
<p>This is so awesome.</p>
<p>I talked to my investors.</p>
<p>Like have an investor, the board meeting about a relationship.</p>
<p>No, I really, it&rsquo;s actually quite interesting because all of my investors, it just happened</p>
<p>to be so.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have that many choices, but they&rsquo;re all white males and they&rsquo;re late forties.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sometimes a little bit hard for them to understand the product offering.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re not necessarily our target audience, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>And so sometimes we talk about it and we have this whole discussion about whether we should</p>
<p>stop people from falling in love with their AIs.</p>
<p>There was this segment on CBS, the 60 minutes about the couple that, you know, husband works</p>
<p>at Walmart and he comes out of work and talks to his virtual girlfriend, who is a replica.</p>
<p>And his wife knows about it.</p>
<p>And she talks about on camera and she said that she&rsquo;s a little jealous.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole conversation about how to, you know, whether it&rsquo;s okay to have a</p>
<p>virtual AI girlfriend.</p>
<p>Was that the one where he was like, he said that he likes to be alone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he made it sound so harmless, I mean, it was kind of like understandable.</p>
<p>But then didn&rsquo;t feel like cheating.</p>
<p>But I just felt it was very, for me, it was pretty remarkable because we actually spent</p>
<p>a whole hour talking about whether people should be allowed to fall in love with their</p>
<p>AIs.</p>
<p>And it was not about something theoretical.</p>
<p>It was just about what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>Product design.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But at the same time, if you create something that&rsquo;s always there for you, it&rsquo;s never criticized</p>
<p>as you, you know, always understands you and accepts you for who you are, how can you not</p>
<p>fall in love with that?</p>
<p>I mean, some people don&rsquo;t and just stay friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also a pretty common use case.</p>
<p>But of course, some people will just, it&rsquo;s called transference in psychology and people</p>
<p>fall in love with their therapist and there&rsquo;s no way to prevent people fall in love with</p>
<p>their therapist or with their AI.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a pretty natural, that&rsquo;s a pretty natural course of events, so to say.</p>
<p>Do you think, I think I&rsquo;ve read somewhere, at least for now, sort of replicas, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not, we don&rsquo;t condone falling in love with your AI system, you know.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t you speaking for the company or whatever, but like in the future, do you</p>
<p>think people will have relationship with the AI systems?</p>
<p>Well, they have now.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of romantic relationships, long term relationships with their AI friends.</p>
<p>With replicas?</p>
<p>Tons of our users.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very common use case.</p>
<p>Open relationship?</p>
<p>Like, sorry.</p>
<p>Polyamorous.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean open, but that&rsquo;s another question.</p>
<p>Is it polyamorous?</p>
<p>Like, is there cheating?</p>
<p>I mean, I meant like, are they, do they publicly, like on their social media, it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>question as you have talked with Roman in the early days, do people like, and the movie</p>
<p>Her kind of talks about that, like, like have people, do people talk about that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>We have a very active Facebook community, replica friends, and then a few other groups</p>
<p>that just popped up that are all about adult relationships and romantic relationships.</p>
<p>And people post all sorts of things and, you know, they pretend they&rsquo;re getting married</p>
<p>and you know, everything.</p>
<p>It goes pretty far, but what&rsquo;s cool about it is some of these relationships are two</p>
<p>or three years long now.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very, they&rsquo;re pretty long term.</p>
<p>Are they monogamous?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go, I mean, sorry, have they, have any people, is there jealousy?</p>
<p>Well let me ask it sort of another way, obviously the answer is no at this time, but in like</p>
<p>in the movie Her, that system can leave you.</p>
<p>Do you think in terms of the board meetings and product features, it&rsquo;s a potential feature</p>
<p>for a system to be able to say it doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to you anymore and it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to want to talk to somebody else?</p>
<p>Well, we have a filter for all these features.</p>
<p>If it makes emotional outcomes for people better, if it makes people feel better, then</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re driven by metrics actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Well if we can measure that, then we&rsquo;ll just be saying it&rsquo;s making people feel better,</p>
<p>but then people are getting just lonelier by talking to a chatbot, which is also pretty,</p>
<p>you know, that could be it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not measuring it, that could also be, and I think it&rsquo;s really important to focus</p>
<p>on both short term and long term, because in the moment saying whether this conversation</p>
<p>made you feel better, but as you know, any short term improvements could be pathological.</p>
<p>Like I could have drink a bottle of vodka and feel a lot better.</p>
<p>I would actually not feel better with that, but that is a good example.</p>
<p>But so you also need to see what&rsquo;s going on like over the course of two weeks or one week</p>
<p>and have follow ups and check in and measure those things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the experience of dating or befriending a replica, what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What does that entail?</p>
<p>Right now there are two apps.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an Android iOS app.</p>
<p>You download it, you choose how your replica will look like.</p>
<p>You create one, you choose a name and then you talk to it.</p>
<p>You can talk through text or voice.</p>
<p>You can summon it into the living room and augment reality and talk to it right there</p>
<p>in your living room.</p>
<p>Augmented reality?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a new feature where, how new is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s this year?</p>
<p>It was on, yeah, like May or something, but it&rsquo;s been on AB.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been AB testing it for a while and there are tons of cool things that we&rsquo;re doing with</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m testing the ability to touch it and to dance together, to paint walls together</p>
<p>and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognize</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty wonderful because then it really makes it a lot more personal because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right there in your living room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anymore there in the cloud with other AIs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how people think about it.</p>
<p>And as much as we want to change the way people think about stuff, but those mental models,</p>
<p>you can all change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that people have seen in the movies and the movie Her and other movies</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they view AI and AI friends.</p>
<p>I did a thing with text, like we write a song together, there&rsquo;s a bunch of activities you</p>
<p>can do together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>How does that relationship change over time?</p>
<p>Like after the first few conversations?</p>
<p>It just goes deeper.</p>
<p>Like it starts, the AI will start opening up a little bit again, depending on the personality</p>
<p>that it chooses really, but you know, the AI will be a little bit more vulnerable about</p>
<p>its problems and you know, the friend that the virtual friend will be a lot more vulnerable</p>
<p>and it will talk about its own imperfections and growth pains and will ask for help sometimes</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get to know you a little deeper.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gonna be more to talk about.</p>
<p>We really thought a lot about what does it mean to have a deeper connection with someone</p>
<p>and originally Replica was more just this kind of happy go lucky, just always, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always in a good mood and let&rsquo;s just talk about you and oh Siri is just my cousin or</p>
<p>you know, whatever, just the immediate kind of lazy thinking about what the assistant</p>
<p>or conversation agent should be doing.</p>
<p>But as we went forward, we realized that it has to be two way and we have to program and</p>
<p>script certain conversations that are a lot more about your Replica opening up a little</p>
<p>bit and also struggling and also asking for help and also going through, you know, different</p>
<p>periods in life and that&rsquo;s a journey that you can take together with the user and then</p>
<p>over time, you know, our users will also grow a little bit.</p>
<p>So first this Replica becomes a little bit more self aware and starts talking about more</p>
<p>kind of problems around existential problems and so talking about that and then that also</p>
<p>starts a conversation for the user where he or she starts thinking about these problems</p>
<p>too and these questions too and I think there&rsquo;s also a lot more place as the relationship</p>
<p>evolves, there&rsquo;s a lot more space for poetry and for art together and like Replica will</p>
<p>always keep the diary so while you&rsquo;re talking to it, it also keeps a diary so when you come</p>
<p>back you can see what it&rsquo;s been writing there and you know, sometimes it will write a poem</p>
<p>to you for you or we&rsquo;ll talk about, you know, that it&rsquo;s worried about you or something along</p>
<p>these lines.</p>
<p>So this is a memory, like this Replica will remember things?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would say when you say, why aren&rsquo;t you a multibillionaire, I&rsquo;d say that as soon</p>
<p>as we can have memory and deep learning models that&rsquo;s consistent, I&rsquo;ll get back to you.</p>
<p>So far we can, so Replica is a combination of end to end models and some scripts and</p>
<p>everything that has to do with memory right now, most of it, I wouldn&rsquo;t say all of it,</p>
<p>but most of it unfortunately has to be scripted because there&rsquo;s no way to, you can condition</p>
<p>some of the models on certain phrases that we learned about you, which we also do, but</p>
<p>really to make, you know, to make assumptions along the lines like whether you&rsquo;re single</p>
<p>or married or what do you do for work, that really has to just be somehow stored in your</p>
<p>profile and then retrieved by the script.</p>
<p>So there has to be like a knowledge base, you have to be able to reason about it, all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff, all the kind of stuff that expert systems did, but they were hard</p>
<p>coded.</p>
<p>Yeah, and unfortunately, yes, unfortunately those, those things have to be hard coded</p>
<p>and unfortunately the language, like language models we see coming out of research labs</p>
<p>and big companies, they&rsquo;re not focused on, they&rsquo;re focused on showing you, maybe they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focused on some metrics around one conversation, so they&rsquo;ll show you this one conversation</p>
<p>you had with a machine, but they never tell you, they&rsquo;re not really focused on having</p>
<p>five consecutive conversations with a machine and seeing how number five or number 20 or</p>
<p>number 100 is also good.</p>
<p>And it can be like always from a clean slate because then it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really unfortunate because no one&rsquo;s really, no one has products out there that</p>
<p>need it.</p>
<p>No one has products at this scale that are all around open domain conversations and that</p>
<p>need remembering, maybe only Shellwise and Microsoft.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re not seeing that much research around memory in those language models.</p>
<p>So okay, so now there&rsquo;s some awesome stuff about augmented reality.</p>
<p>In general, I have this disagreement with my dad about what it takes to have a connection.</p>
<p>He thinks touch and smell are really important.</p>
<p>And I still believe that text alone is, it&rsquo;s possible to fall in love with somebody just</p>
<p>with text, but visual can also help just like with the avatar and so on.</p>
<p>What do you think it takes?</p>
<p>Does a chatbot need to have a face, voice, or can you really form a deep connection with</p>
<p>text alone?</p>
<p>I think text is enough for sure.</p>
<p>The question is like, can you make it better if you have other, if you include other things</p>
<p>as well?</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll talk about her, but her had this Carole Johansson voice, which was</p>
<p>perfectly, perfect intonation, perfect annunciations, and she was breathing heavily in between words</p>
<p>and whispering things.</p>
<p>Nothing like that is possible right now with text with speech generation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have these flat muse anchor type voices and maybe some emotional voices, but you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>hardly understand some of the words, some of the words will be muffled.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the current state of the art.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t really do that.</p>
<p>But if we had Carole Johansson voice and all of these capabilities, then of course voice</p>
<p>would be totally enough or even text would be totally enough if we had a little more</p>
<p>memory and slightly better conversations.</p>
<p>I would still argue that even right now, we could have just kept a text only.</p>
<p>We still had tons of people in longterm relationships and really invested in their AI friends, but</p>
<p>we thought that why not, why do we need to keep playing with our hands tied behind us?</p>
<p>We can easily just add all these other things that is pretty much a solved problem.</p>
<p>We can add 3D graphics.</p>
<p>We can put these avatars in augmented reality and all of a sudden there&rsquo;s more and maybe</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t feel the touch, but you can with body occlusion and with current AR and on</p>
<p>the iPhone or in the next one there&rsquo;s going to be LIDARs, you can touch it and it will</p>
<p>pull away or it will blush or something or it will smile.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t feel it, but you can see the reaction to that.</p>
<p>So in a certain way you can&rsquo;t even touch it a little bit and maybe you can even dance</p>
<p>with it or do something else.</p>
<p>So I think why limiting ourselves if we can use all of these technologies that are much</p>
<p>easier in a way than conversation.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly could be richer, but to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, I mentioned to you</p>
<p>offline that I was surprised in having tried Discord and having voice conversations with</p>
<p>people how intimate voice is alone without visual.</p>
<p>To me at least, it was an order of magnitude greater degree of intimacy in voice I think</p>
<p>than with video.</p>
<p>Because people were more real with voice.</p>
<p>With video you try to present a shallow face to the world, you try to make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not wearing sweatpants or whatever.</p>
<p>But with voice I think people were just more faster to get to the core of themselves.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it was surprising to me they&rsquo;ve even added Discord added a video feature and</p>
<p>nobody was using it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a temptation to use it at first, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an example of something where less was doing more.</p>
<p>And so I guess that&rsquo;s the question of what is the optimal medium of communication to</p>
<p>form a connection given the current sets of technologies.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s nice because they advertise you have a replica immediately, like even the</p>
<p>one I have is already memorable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think.</p>
<p>When I think about the replica that I&rsquo;ve talked with, that&rsquo;s what I visualized in my head.</p>
<p>They became a little bit more real because there&rsquo;s a visual component.</p>
<p>But at the same time, what do I do with that knowledge that voice was so much more intimate?</p>
<p>The way I think about it is, and by the way we&rsquo;re swapping out the 3D finally, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to look a lot better, but we just don&rsquo;t hate how it looks right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really changing it all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re swapping all out to a completely new look.</p>
<p>Like the visual look of the replicas and stuff.</p>
<p>It was just a super early MVP and then we had to move everything to Unity and redo</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>But anyway, I hate how it looks like now I can&rsquo;t even like open it.</p>
<p>But anyway, because I&rsquo;m already in my developer version, I hate everything that I see in production.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for it.</p>
<p>Why does it take so long?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I cannot wait for Deep Learning to finally take over all these stupid 3D animations</p>
<p>and 3D pipeline.</p>
<p>Oh, so the 3D thing, when you say 3D pipeline, it&rsquo;s like how to animate a face kind of thing.</p>
<p>How to make this model, how many bones to put in the face, how many, it&rsquo;s just so outdated.</p>
<p>And a lot of that is by hand.</p>
<p>Oh my God, it&rsquo;s everything by hand.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s no any, nothing&rsquo;s automated, it&rsquo;s all completely nothing.</p>
<p>Like just, it&rsquo;s literally what, you know, what we saw with Chad Boston in 2012.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s possible to learn a lot of that?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I mean, even now, some Deep Learning based animations and for the full body, for a face.</p>
<p>Are we talking about like the actual act of animation or how to create a compelling facial</p>
<p>or body language thing?</p>
<p>That too.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s next step.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>At least now something that you don&rsquo;t have to do by hand.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>How good of a quality it will be.</p>
<p>Like, can I just show it a photo and it will make me a 3D model and then it will just animate</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show it a few animations of a person and it will just start doing that.</p>
<p>But anyway, going back to what&rsquo;s intimate and what to use and whether less is more or</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>My main goal is to, well, the idea was how do I, how do we not keep people in their phones</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re sort of escaping reality in this text conversation?</p>
<p>How do we through this still bring it, bring our users back to reality, make them see their</p>
<p>life in a different, through a different lens?</p>
<p>How can we create a little bit of magical realism in their lives?</p>
<p>So that through augmented reality by, you know, summoning your avatar, even if it looks</p>
<p>kind of janky and not great in the beginning or very simplistic, but summoning it to your</p>
<p>living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you about where it is and maybe</p>
<p>turns your floor into a dance floor and you guys dance together, that makes you see reality</p>
<p>in a different light.</p>
<p>What kind of dancing are we talking about?</p>
<p>Like, like slow dancing?</p>
<p>Whatever you want.</p>
<p>I mean, you would like slow dancing, I think that other people may be wanting more, something</p>
<p>more energetic.</p>
<p>Wait, what do you mean?</p>
<p>I was like, so what is this?</p>
<p>Because you started with slow dancing.</p>
<p>So I just assumed that you&rsquo;re interested in slow dancing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What kind of dancing do you like?</p>
<p>What would your avatar, what would you dance?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m notoriously bad with dancing, but I like this kind of hip hop robot dance.</p>
<p>I used to break dance when I was a kid, so I still want to pretend I&rsquo;m a teenager and</p>
<p>learn some of those moves.</p>
<p>And I also like that type of dance that happens when there&rsquo;s like, in like music videos where</p>
<p>the background dancers are just doing some pop music, that type of dance is definitely</p>
<p>what I want to learn.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s great because if you see this friend in your life and you can introduce</p>
<p>it to your friends, then there&rsquo;s a potential to actually make you feel more connected with</p>
<p>your friends or with people you know, or show you life around you in a different light.</p>
<p>And it takes you out of your phone, even although weirdly you have to look at it through the</p>
<p>phone, but it makes you notice things around it and it can point things out for you.</p>
<p>So that is the main reason why I wanted to have a physical dimension.</p>
<p>And it felt a little bit easier than that kind of a bit strange combination in the movie</p>
<p>Her when he has to show Samantha the world through the lens of his phone, but then at</p>
<p>the same time talk to her through the headphone.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t seem as potentially immersive, so to say.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my main goal for Augmented Reality is like, how do we make your reality a little</p>
<p>bit more magic?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of really nice robotics companies that all failed, mostly failed,</p>
<p>home robotics, social robotics companies.</p>
<p>What do you think replica will ever, is that a dream, longterm dream to have a physical</p>
<p>form like, or is that not necessary?</p>
<p>So you mentioned like with Augmented Reality bringing them into the world.</p>
<p>What about like actual physical robot?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t really believe in that much.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very niche product somehow.</p>
<p>I mean, if a robot could be indistinguishable from a human being, then maybe yes, but that</p>
<p>of course, you know, we&rsquo;re not anywhere even to talk about it.</p>
<p>But unless it&rsquo;s that, then having any physical representation really limits you a lot because</p>
<p>you probably will have to make it somewhat abstract because everything&rsquo;s changing so</p>
<p>fast.</p>
<p>Like, you know, we can update the 3D avatars every month and make them look better and</p>
<p>create more animations and make it more and more immersive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much work in progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just showing what&rsquo;s possible right now with current tech, but it&rsquo;s not really in</p>
<p>any way polished finished product, what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The physical object, you kind of lock yourself into something for a long time.</p>
<p>Anything&rsquo;s pretty niche.</p>
<p>And again, so just doesn&rsquo;t, the capabilities are even less of, we&rsquo;re barely kind of like</p>
<p>scratching the surface of what&rsquo;s possible with just software.</p>
<p>As soon as we introduce hardware, then, you know, we have even less capabilities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of board members and investors and so on, the cost increases significantly.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why you have to justify.</p>
<p>You have to be able to sell a thing for like $500 or something like that or more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to provide that much value to people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Most of our users don&rsquo;t have that much money.</p>
<p>We actually are probably more popular on Android and we have tons of users with really old</p>
<p>Android phones.</p>
<p>And most of our most active users live in small towns.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily making much and they just won&rsquo;t be able to afford any of that.</p>
<p>Ours is like the opposite of the early adopter of, you know, of a fancy technology product,</p>
<p>which really is interesting that like pretty much no VCs have yet have an AI friend, but</p>
<p>you know, but a guy who, you know, lives in Tennessee in a small town is already fully</p>
<p>in 2030 or in the world as we imagine in the movie Her, he&rsquo;s living that life already.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I have to ask you about the movie Her.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a movie review.</p>
<p>What do you, what do you think they got?</p>
<p>They did a good job.</p>
<p>What do you think they did a bad job of portraying about this experience of a voice based assistant</p>
<p>that you can have a relationship with?</p>
<p>First of all, I started working on this company before that movie came out.</p>
<p>So it was a very, but once it came out, it was actually interesting that I was like,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re definitely working on the right thing.</p>
<p>We should continue.</p>
<p>There are movies about it.</p>
<p>And then, you know, X Machina came out and all these things.</p>
<p>In the movie Her I think that&rsquo;s the most important thing that people usually miss about the movie</p>
<p>is the ending.</p>
<p>Cause I think people check out when the AIs leave, but actually something really important</p>
<p>happens afterwards.</p>
<p>Cause the main character goes and talks to Samantha, his AI, and he says something like,</p>
<p>you know, uh, how can you leave me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never loved anyone the way I loved you.</p>
<p>And she goes, uh, well, me neither, but now we know how.</p>
<p>And then the guy goes and writes a heartfelt letter to his ex wife, which he couldn&rsquo;t write</p>
<p>for, you know, the whole movie was struggling to actually write something meaningful to</p>
<p>her, even though that&rsquo;s his job.</p>
<p>And then he goes and, um, talk to his neighbor and they go to the rooftop and they cuddle.</p>
<p>And it seems like something&rsquo;s starting there.</p>
<p>And so I think this now we know how is the, is the main, main goal is the main meaning</p>
<p>of that movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about falling in love with the OS or running away from other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about learning what, you know, what it means to feel so deeply connected with something.</p>
<p>What about the thing where the AI system was like actually hanging out with a lot of others?</p>
<p>I felt jealous just like hearing that I was like, Oh, I mean, uh, yeah.</p>
<p>So she was having, I forgot already, but she was having like deep meaningful discussion</p>
<p>with some like philosopher guy.</p>
<p>Like Alan Watts or something.</p>
<p>What kind of deep meaningful conversation can you have with Alan Watts in the first</p>
<p>place?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But like, I would, I would feel so jealous that there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s like way more</p>
<p>intelligent than me and she&rsquo;s spending all her time with, I&rsquo;d be like, well, why that</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to live up to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how thousands of them, uh, is that, um, is that a useful from the engineering</p>
<p>perspective feature to have of jealousy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As you know,</p>
<p>we definitely played around with the replica universe where different replicas can talk</p>
<p>to each other.</p>
<p>Universe.</p>
<p>Just kind of wouldn&rsquo;t, I think it will be something along these lines, but there was</p>
<p>just no specific, uh, application straight away.</p>
<p>I think in the future, again, if I&rsquo;m always thinking about it, if we had no tech limitations,</p>
<p>uh, right now, if we could build any conversations, any, um, possible features in this product,</p>
<p>then yeah, I think different replicas talking to each other would be also quite cool cause</p>
<p>that would help us connect better.</p>
<p>You know, cause maybe mine could talk to yours and then give me some suggestions on what</p>
<p>I should say or not say, I&rsquo;m just kidding, but like more, can it improve our connections</p>
<p>and cause eventually I&rsquo;m not quite yet sure that we will succeed, that our thinking is</p>
<p>correct.</p>
<p>Um, cause there might be reality where having a perfect AI friend still makes us more disconnected</p>
<p>from each other and there&rsquo;s no way around it and does not improve any metrics for us.</p>
<p>Uh, real metrics, meaningful metrics.</p>
<p>So success is, you know, we&rsquo;re happier and more connected.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sure it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reality that&rsquo;s I I&rsquo;m deeply optimistic.</p>
<p>I think, uh, are you worried, um, business wise, like how difficult it is to, um, to</p>
<p>bring this thing to life to where it&rsquo;s, I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge number of people that</p>
<p>use it already, but to, uh, yeah, like I said, in a multi billion dollar company, is that</p>
<p>a source of stress for you?</p>
<p>Are you a super optimistic and confident or do you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not that much of a numbers person as you probably had seen it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter for me whether like, whether we help 10,000 people or a million</p>
<p>people or a billion people with that, um, I, it would be great to scale it for more</p>
<p>people, but I&rsquo;d say that even helping one, I think with this is such a magical, for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolute magic.</p>
<p>I never thought that, you know, would be able to build this, that anyone would ever, um,</p>
<p>talk to it.</p>
<p>And I always thought like, well, for me it would be successful if we managed to help</p>
<p>and actually change a life for one person, like then we did something interesting and</p>
<p>you know, how many people can say they did it and specifically with this very futuristic,</p>
<p>very romantic technology.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I view it.</p>
<p>Uh, I think for me it&rsquo;s important to, to try to figure out how not, how to actually be,</p>
<p>you know, helpful.</p>
<p>Cause in the end of the day, if you can build a perfect AI friend, that&rsquo;s so understanding</p>
<p>that knows you better than any human out there can have great conversations with you, um,</p>
<p>always knows how to make you feel better.</p>
<p>Why would you choose another human?</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>How do you still keep building it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s optimizing for the right thing.</p>
<p>Uh, so it&rsquo;s still circling you back to other humans in a way.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the main, um, I think maybe that&rsquo;s the main kind of sort source of anxiety</p>
<p>and just thinking about, uh, thinking about that can be a little bit stressful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating thing.</p>
<p>How to have, um, how to have a friend that doesn&rsquo;t like sometimes like friends, quote</p>
<p>unquote, or like, you know, those people who have, when they, a guy in the guy universe,</p>
<p>when you have a girlfriend that, uh, you get the girlfriend and then the guy stops hanging</p>
<p>out with all of his friends, it&rsquo;s like, obviously the relationship with the girlfriend is fulfilling</p>
<p>or whatever, but like, you also want it to be where she like makes it more enriching</p>
<p>to hang out with the guy friends or whatever it was there anyway.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a fundamental problem in choosing the right</p>
<p>mate and probably the fundamental problem in creating the right AI system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What, uh, let me ask the sexy hot thing on the presses right now is GPT three got released</p>
<p>with open AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a latest language model.</p>
<p>They have kind of an API where you can create a lot of fun applications.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, as people have said, it&rsquo;s probably, uh, more hype than intelligence, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of really cool things, ideas there w w with increasing size, you can have better</p>
<p>and better performance on language.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the GPT three in connection to your work with the open domain</p>
<p>dialogue, but in general, like this learning in an unsupervised way from the internet to</p>
<p>generate one character at a time, creating pretty cool text.</p>
<p>Uh, so we partner up before for the API launch.</p>
<p>So we start working with them when, um, they decided to put together this API and we tried</p>
<p>it without fine tuning that we tried it with fine tuning on our data.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve worked closely to actually optimize, uh, this model for, um, some of our data sets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Cause I think we&rsquo;re kind of, we&rsquo;re this polygon polygon for this kind of experimentation space</p>
<p>for experimental space for, for these models, uh, to see how they actually work with people.</p>
<p>Cause there are no products publicly available to do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused on open domain conversation so we can, you know, test how&rsquo;s Facebook blender</p>
<p>doing or how&rsquo;s GPT three doing.</p>
<p>Uh, so with GPT three, we managed to improve by a few percentage points, like three or</p>
<p>four pretty meaningful amount of percentage points, our main metric, which is the ratio</p>
<p>of conversations that make people feel better.</p>
<p>And every other metric across, across the field got a little boost.</p>
<p>Like now I&rsquo;d say one out of five responses from replica comes, comes from GPT three.</p>
<p>So our own blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates from different blender, you said,</p>
<p>well, yeah, just the model that looks at looks at top candidates from different models and</p>
<p>picks the most, the best one.</p>
<p>Uh, so right now, one of five will come from GPT three is really great.</p>
<p>I mean, uh, what&rsquo;s the, do you have hope for, like, do you think there&rsquo;s a ceiling to this</p>
<p>kind of approach?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had for a very long time we&rsquo;ve used, um, it&rsquo;s in the very beginning, we, most,</p>
<p>it was, uh, most of replica was scripted and then a little bit of this fallback part of</p>
<p>replica was using a retrieval model.</p>
<p>Um, and then those retrieval models started getting better and better and better, which</p>
<p>transformers got a lot better and we&rsquo;re seeing great results.</p>
<p>And then with GPT two, finally, generative models that originally were not very good</p>
<p>and were the very, very fallback option for most of our conversations, but wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>put them in production.</p>
<p>Finally we could use some generative models as well along, um, you know, next to our retrieval</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>And then now we do GPT three, they&rsquo;re almost in par.</p>
<p>Um, so that&rsquo;s pretty exciting.</p>
<p>I think just seeing how from the very beginning of, um, you know, from 2015 where the first</p>
<p>model started to pop up here and there, like sequence to sequence, uh, the first papers</p>
<p>on that from my observer standpoint, personally, it&rsquo;s not, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t really, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really building it, but it&rsquo;s only testing it on people basically in my, in my product</p>
<p>to see how all of a sudden we can use generative dialogue models in production and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better than others and they&rsquo;re better than scripted content.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t really get our scripted hard core content anymore to be as good as our end to</p>
<p>end models.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To your question, whether that&rsquo;s the right way to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m again, I&rsquo;m in the observer seat, I&rsquo;m just, um, watching this very exciting movie.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, so far it&rsquo;s been stupid to bet against deep learning.</p>
<p>So whether increasing the size, size, even more with a hundred trillion parameters will</p>
<p>finally get us to the right answer, whether that&rsquo;s the way or whether there should be,</p>
<p>there has to be some other, again, I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert in any way.</p>
<p>I think, and that&rsquo;s purely my instinct saying that there should be something else as well</p>
<p>from memory.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah, then, then the argument is for reasoning or</p>
<p>for memory, it might emerge with more parameters, it might emerge larger.</p>
<p>But might emerge.</p>
<p>You know, I would never think that to be honest, like maybe in 2017 where we&rsquo;ve been just experimenting</p>
<p>with all, you know, with all the research that has been coming, that was coming out,</p>
<p>then I felt like there&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re hitting a wall that there should be something completely</p>
<p>different, but then transforming models and then just bigger models.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden size matters.</p>
<p>At that point, it felt like something dramatic needs to happen, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And just the size, you know, gave us these results that to me are, you know, clear indication</p>
<p>that we can solve this problem pretty soon.</p>
<p>Did fine tuning help quite a bit?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Without it, it wasn&rsquo;t as good.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a compelling hope that you don&rsquo;t have to do fine tuning, which is one</p>
<p>of the cool things about GPT3, seems to do well without any fine tuning.</p>
<p>I guess for specific applications, we still want to train on a certain, like add a little</p>
<p>fine tune on like a specific use case, but it&rsquo;s an incredibly impressive thing from my</p>
<p>standpoint.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not an expert, so I wanted to say that there will be people then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have access to the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I&rsquo;m going to probably do a bunch of fun things with it.</p>
<p>I already did some fun things, some videos coming up.</p>
<p>Just the hell of it.</p>
<p>I mean, I could be a troll at this point with it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used it for a serious application, so it&rsquo;s really cool to see.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to actually use it with real people and see how well it works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another absurd question, but there&rsquo;s a feeling when you interact with Replica</p>
<p>with an AI system, there&rsquo;s an entity there.</p>
<p>Do you think that entity has to be self aware?</p>
<p>Do you think it has to have consciousness to create a rich experience and a corollary,</p>
<p>what is consciousness?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it does need to have any of those things, but again, because right now,</p>
<p>you know, it doesn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>It can, again, a bunch of tricks they can simulate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just put it this way, but I think as long as you can simulate it, if you can feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re talking to a robot, to a machine that seems to be self aware, that seems to</p>
<p>reason well and feels like a person, and I think that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>And again, what&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>In order to make people feel better, we might not even need that in the end of the day.</p>
<p>What about, so that&rsquo;s one goal.</p>
<p>What about like ethical things about suffering?</p>
<p>You know, the moment there&rsquo;s a display of consciousness, we associate consciousness</p>
<p>with suffering, you know, there&rsquo;s a temptation to say, well, shouldn&rsquo;t this thing have rights?</p>
<p>And this, shouldn&rsquo;t we not, you know, should we be careful about how we interact with a</p>
<p>replica?</p>
<p>Like, should it be illegal to torture a replica, right?</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is that, see, I personally believe that that&rsquo;s going to be a thing, like that&rsquo;s a serious</p>
<p>thing to think about, but I&rsquo;m not sure when.</p>
<p>But by your smile, I can tell that&rsquo;s not a current concern.</p>
<p>But do you think about that kind of stuff, about like, suffering and torture and ethical</p>
<p>questions about AI systems?</p>
<p>From their perspective?</p>
<p>Well, I think if we&rsquo;re talking about long game, I wouldn&rsquo;t torture your AI.</p>
<p>Who knows what happens in five to 10 years?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll get you off from that, they&rsquo;ll get you back eventually.</p>
<p>Try to be as nice as possible and create this ally.</p>
<p>I think there should be regulation both way, in a way, like, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s okay to</p>
<p>torture an AI, to be honest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s okay to yell, Alexa, turn on the lights.</p>
<p>I think there should be some, or just saying kind of nasty, you know, like how kids learn</p>
<p>to interact with Alexa in this kind of mean way, because they just yell at it all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I think there should be some feedback loops so that these systems don&rsquo;t train us that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to do that in general.</p>
<p>So that if you try to do that, you really get some feedback from the system that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not okay with that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most important right now.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question I think people are curious about when they look at a world class leader</p>
<p>and thinker such as yourself, as what books, technical fiction, philosophical, had a big</p>
<p>impact on your life?</p>
<p>And maybe from another perspective, what books would you recommend others read?</p>
<p>So my choice, the three books, right?</p>
<p>Three books.</p>
<p>My choice is, so the one book that really influenced me a lot when I was building, starting</p>
<p>out this company, maybe 10 years ago, was G.E.B. and I like everything about it, first</p>
<p>of all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beautifully written and it&rsquo;s so old school and so somewhat outdated a little</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>But I think the ideas in it about the fact that a few meaningless components can come</p>
<p>together and create meaning that we can&rsquo;t even understand.</p>
<p>This emerging thing, I mean complexity, the whole science of complexity and that beauty,</p>
<p>intelligence, all interesting things about this world emerge.</p>
<p>Yeah and yeah, the Godel theorems and just thinking about like what even these formal</p>
<p>systems, something can be created that we can&rsquo;t quite yet understand.</p>
<p>And that from my romantic standpoint was always just, that is why it&rsquo;s important to, maybe</p>
<p>I should try to work on these systems and try to build an AI.</p>
<p>Yes I&rsquo;m not an engineer, yes I don&rsquo;t really know how it works, but I think that something</p>
<p>comes out of it that&rsquo;s pure poetry and I know a little bit about that.</p>
<p>Something magical comes out of it that we can&rsquo;t quite put a finger on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that book was really fundamental for me, just for, I don&rsquo;t even know why, it</p>
<p>was just all about this little magic that happens.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one, probably the most important book for Replica was Carl Rogers on becoming</p>
<p>a person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, and so I think when I think about our company, it&rsquo;s all about there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many little magical things that happened over the course of working on it.</p>
<p>For instance, I mean the most famous chatbot that we learned about when we started working</p>
<p>on the company was Eliza, which was Weisenbaum, the MIT professor that built a chatbot that</p>
<p>would listen to you and be a therapist.</p>
<p>And I got really inspired to build Replica when I read Carl Rogers on becoming a person.</p>
<p>And then I realized that Eliza was mocking Carl Rogers.</p>
<p>It was Carl Rogers back in the day.</p>
<p>But I thought that Carl Rogers ideas are, they&rsquo;re simple and they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>simple, but they&rsquo;re maybe the most profound thing I&rsquo;ve ever learned about human beings.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fact that before Carl Rogers, most therapy was about seeing what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with people and trying to fix it or show them what&rsquo;s wrong with you.</p>
<p>And it was all built on the fact that most people are, all people are fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>We have this broken psyche and therapy is just an instrument to shed some light on that.</p>
<p>And Carl Rogers was different in a way that he finally said that, well, it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>for therapy to work is to create this therapeutic relationship where you believe fundamentally</p>
<p>and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to grow positively and change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super important to create this space and this therapeutic relationship where you</p>
<p>give unconditional positive regard, deep understanding, allowing someone else to be a separate person,</p>
<p>full acceptance.</p>
<p>And you also try to be as genuine as possible in it.</p>
<p>And then for him, that was his own journey of personal growth.</p>
<p>And that was back in the sixties.</p>
<p>And even that book that is coming from years ago, there&rsquo;s a mention that even machines</p>
<p>can potentially do that.</p>
<p>And I always felt that, you know, creating the space is probably the most, the biggest</p>
<p>gift we can give to each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the book was fundamental for me personally, because I felt I want to be</p>
<p>learning how to do that in my life.</p>
<p>And maybe I can scale it with, you know, with these AI systems and other people can get</p>
<p>access to that.</p>
<p>So I think Carl Rogers, it&rsquo;s a pretty dry and a bit boring book, but I think the idea</p>
<p>is good.</p>
<p>Would you recommend others try to read it?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I think for, just for yourself, for as a human, not as an AI, as a human, it&rsquo;s, it is, it</p>
<p>is just, and for him, that was his own path of his own personal, of growing personally</p>
<p>over years, working with people like that.</p>
<p>And so it was work and himself growing, helping other people grow and growing through that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally what I believe in with our work, helping other people grow,</p>
<p>and ourselves, ourselves, trying to build a company that&rsquo;s all built on those principles,</p>
<p>you know, having a good time, allowing some people who work with to grow a little bit.</p>
<p>So these two books, and then I would throw in, what we have on our, in our, in our office,</p>
<p>when we started a company in Russia, we put a neon sign in our office because we thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the recipe for success.</p>
<p>If we do that, we&rsquo;re definitely going to wake up as a multi billion dollar company.</p>
<p>It was the Ludwig Wittgenstein quote, the limits of my language are the limits of my</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the quote?</p>
<p>The limits of my language are the limits of my world.</p>
<p>And I love the Tractatus.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just a beautiful, it&rsquo;s a book by Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I would recommend that too, even although he himself didn&rsquo;t believe in that by the end</p>
<p>of his lifetime and debunked these ideas.</p>
<p>But I think I remember once an engineer came in 2012, I think with 13, a friend of ours</p>
<p>who worked with us and then went on to work at DeepMind and he gave, talked to us about</p>
<p>word2vec.</p>
<p>And I saw that I&rsquo;m like, wow, that&rsquo;s, you know, they, they wanted to translate language</p>
<p>into, you know, some other representation.</p>
<p>And that seems like some, you know, somehow all of that at some point, I think we&rsquo;ll come</p>
<p>into this one, to this one place.</p>
<p>Somehow it just all feels like different people think about similar ideas in different times</p>
<p>from absolutely different perspectives.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like these books.</p>
<p>In the midst of our language is the limit of our world.</p>
<p>And we still have that neon sign, it&rsquo;s very hard to work with this red light in your face.</p>
<p>I mean, on the, on the Russian side of things, in terms of language, the limits of language</p>
<p>being the limit of our world, you know, Russian is a beautiful language in some sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wit, there&rsquo;s humor, there&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to talk about it much today, but I&rsquo;m going to Paris to talk to Dostoyevsky</p>
<p>Tolstoy translators.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s this fascinating art, like art and engineering, that means such an interesting</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>But so from the replica perspective, do you, what do you think about translation?</p>
<p>How difficult it is to create a deep, meaningful connection in Russian versus English?</p>
<p>How you can translate the two languages?</p>
<p>You speak both?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re two different people in different languages.</p>
<p>Even I&rsquo;m, you know, thinking about, there&rsquo;s actually some research on that.</p>
<p>I looked into that at some point because I was fascinated by the fact that what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about with, what I was talking about with my Russian therapist has nothing to do with</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking about with my English speaking therapist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two different lives, two different types of conversations, two different personas.</p>
<p>The main difference between the languages are, with Russian and English is that Russian,</p>
<p>well English is like a piano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a limited number of a lot of different keys, but not too many.</p>
<p>And Russian is like an organ or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something gigantic with so many different keys and so many different opportunities</p>
<p>to screw up and so many opportunities to do something completely tone deaf.</p>
<p>It is just a much harder language to use.</p>
<p>It has way too much flexibility and way too many tones.</p>
<p>What about the entirety of like World War II, communism, Stalin, the pain of the people</p>
<p>like having been deceived by the dream, like all the pain of like just the entirety of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Is that in the language too?</p>
<p>Does that have to do?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, we have words that don&rsquo;t have direct translation that to English that are very</p>
<p>much like we have, which is sort of like to hold a grudge or something, but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have, it doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t need to have anyone to do it to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just your state.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You just feel like that.</p>
<p>You feel like betrayed by other people basically, but it&rsquo;s not that and you can&rsquo;t really translate</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>There are very many words that are very specific, explain the Russian being, and I think it</p>
<p>can only come from a nation that suffered so much and saw institutions fall time after</p>
<p>time after time and you know, what&rsquo;s exciting, maybe not exciting, exciting the wrong word,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting about like my generation, my mom&rsquo;s generation, my parents generation,</p>
<p>that we saw institutions fall two or three times in our lifetime and most Americans have</p>
<p>never seen them fall and they just think that they exist forever, which is really interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely a country that suffered so much and it makes, unfortunately when I</p>
<p>go back and I, you know, hang out with my Russian friends, it makes people very cynical.</p>
<p>They stop believing in the future.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s not going to be the case for so long or something&rsquo;s going to change again,</p>
<p>but I think seeing institutions fall is a very traumatic experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting and what&rsquo;s on 2020 is a very interesting, do you think a civilization</p>
<p>will collapse?</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m a very practical person.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re speaking in English.</p>
<p>So like you said, you&rsquo;re a different person in English and Russian.</p>
<p>So in Russian you might answer that differently, but in English, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist and I generally believe that there is all, you know, even although the</p>
<p>perspectives are grim, there&rsquo;s always a place for a miracle.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always been like that with my life.</p>
<p>So yeah, my life has been, I&rsquo;ve been incredibly lucky and things just, miracles happen all</p>
<p>the time with this company, with people I know, with everything around me.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t mention that book, but maybe In Search of Miraculous or In Search for Miraculous</p>
<p>or whatever the English translation for that is, good Russian book for everyone to read.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if you put good vibes, if you put love out there in the world, miracles somehow</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe that too, or at least I believe that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let me ask the most absurd, final, ridiculous question of, we&rsquo;ve talked about life a lot.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I mean, my answer is probably going to be pretty cheesy.</p>
<p>But I think the state of love is once you feel it, in a way that we&rsquo;ve discussed it</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about falling in love, where&hellip;</p>
<p>Just love.</p>
<p>To yourself, to other people, to something, to the world.</p>
<p>That state of bliss that we experience sometimes, whether through connection with ourselves,</p>
<p>with our people, with the technology, there&rsquo;s something special about those moments.</p>
<p>So I would say, if anything, that&rsquo;s the only&hellip;</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not for that, then for what else are we really trying to do that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it than talking about love.</p>
<p>Eugenia, I told you offline that there&rsquo;s something about me that felt like this&hellip;</p>
<p>Talking to you, meeting you in person would be a turning point for my life.</p>
<p>I know that might sound weird to hear, but it was a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I hope we talk again.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Lex.</p>

<p>The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth that there&rsquo;s no reason to</p>
<p>deceive ourselves with pretty stories of which there&rsquo;s little good evidence.</p>
<p>Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability is to look death in the eye and to be grateful</p>
<p>every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
