    <p>Captain Calacanis is here reporting for duty with a Spirit Airlines cap.</p>
<p>Absolutely Spirit Airlines.</p>
<p>I just want to say all in podcast now sponsored by Moncler and Spirit</p>
<p>Airlines or now sponsored by the village people.</p>
<p>YMCA.</p>
<p>Are you a pilot or a flight attendant?</p>
<p>J.</p>
<p>Cal?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a flight attendant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s thin enough to be a flight attendant.</p>
<p>Are you fat shaming me?</p>
<p>Are you body?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that nowadays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get you canceled.</p>
<p>Getting sacks canceled at this point like fat shaming would be number</p>
<p>72 on the list.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t get canceled because all the libs have left Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody to there&rsquo;s no home monitors left.</p>
<p>They all pretend.</p>
<p>No, they quit every week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the libs you said they moved to Canada when Trump got</p>
<p>elected.</p>
<p>Yeah, Canada immigration.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>A hacker figured out a way to take all this data and track, you know,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s yachts people&rsquo;s planes.</p>
<p>Obviously, one of those people was Elon.</p>
<p>Elon had a security issue.</p>
<p>This is all public information.</p>
<p>So the larger issue at stake here is.</p>
<p>The fact that the law allows for people to do this persistent tracking</p>
<p>of planes, which then becomes persistent tracking of a person.</p>
<p>And what really is at stake here is how we define the term doxing for</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t know the term doxing.</p>
<p>It means giving a person&rsquo;s location that could be your home that could</p>
<p>also be your at a location for some period of time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re at a hotel, you know for a basketball game and it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>clear.</p>
<p>You can take a picture of a celebrity say there&rsquo;s a celebrity here.</p>
<p>Oh Lady Gaga&rsquo;s at the farmers market what I object to here.</p>
<p>We all understand doxing is dangerous and it in fact is against the law</p>
<p>to just give people&rsquo;s addresses and stuff like that.</p>
<p>The issue here is a new type of doxing which I&rsquo;ll call, you know,</p>
<p>persistent coordinated doxing where dozens of times a month you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving a person&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>It may not be against the First Amendment sacks.</p>
<p>I think you would agree, but we have to ask ourselves do we want to</p>
<p>live in a world where whether a person&rsquo;s on an electric bicycle or an</p>
<p>airplane or any device in between somebody should be releasing dozens</p>
<p>of times a month a specific dedicated feet of their location.</p>
<p>It is terrorizing as a parent when this happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had doxing people on the call here have had various security</p>
<p>concerns.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to live in a world with de facto doxing what these sites</p>
<p>were doing was de facto doxing.</p>
<p>I think it was a bad decision and I think that it represented you on</p>
<p>the least generous statement would be that it represents deep hypocrisy</p>
<p>in that not just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Did he say he would never delete that account?</p>
<p>But he also said he was buying Twitter to enable freedom of speech and</p>
<p>freedom of expression and that he wouldn&rsquo;t come in and do the same sort</p>
<p>of content moderation that was done by the old regime and then he came</p>
<p>in and did exactly what the old regime did, which is that he took the</p>
<p>rules and he took the quote moderation policies and he found a way to</p>
<p>use them to make some editorialized decisions that he thought was</p>
<p>appropriate.</p>
<p>Now, the more generous thing is what you guys are saying, which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think is necessarily wrong, which is that he&rsquo;s trying to protect people</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some loophole or some law that doesn&rsquo;t seem right morally,</p>
<p>but it is the law and it is what it is.</p>
<p>In those cases, I think you run into the exact same issue that the old</p>
<p>guard at Twitter had that the moderators and the executives at YouTube</p>
<p>have dealt with and that the executives at Google have dealt with and</p>
<p>that we sit here and we criticize until you&rsquo;re on that side of the</p>
<p>table and you&rsquo;re forced to make these moderation decisions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forced to make these policy decisions and you&rsquo;re forced to</p>
<p>implement these policy decisions because of some moral framework that</p>
<p>you now think is appropriate.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Some people will say that&rsquo;s not freedom of expression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not freedom of speech.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking that away from some people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking this particular case away from a 15 or 16 year old kid</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s built a Twitter feed.</p>
<p>And so I think what it shows is just how hard it is to moderate these</p>
<p>sites, these platforms, and that there is no simple, easy, idealistic</p>
<p>ideologue of, hey, all these things are open.</p>
<p>All these things can be used by anyone all the time, because as soon as</p>
<p>one of these edge cases start to happen, you want to come in and do</p>
<p>something about it.</p>
<p>Shamath, what do you think?</p>
<p>What should happen going forward?</p>
<p>So I have had these issues happen to me multiple times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not nearly as important as Elon is, but it feels the same when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the middle of it.</p>
<p>It feels pretty terrorizing.</p>
<p>That being said, I think the real decision for somebody like me is that</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too much, it&rsquo;s frankly just to get rid of it and to find a</p>
<p>different mode of transportation that&rsquo;s a little bit more anonymous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pragmatic about it.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is that I just think that you would have to</p>
<p>go and get the government to basically change the law, which they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to do.</p>
<p>And so then as a result, your reaction will seem somewhat contrived and</p>
<p>deeply personal.</p>
<p>And in that, I think you lose credibility.</p>
<p>Let me just summarize this and be the first one to just state this.</p>
<p>I think that if there&rsquo;s any person in the world that can figure out</p>
<p>Twitter, it&rsquo;s probably Elon.</p>
<p>But man, has he taken on just a gargantuan battle?</p>
<p>And increasingly, I am not a fan of this battle and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>This is a man who is essentially proven that he can bend the laws of</p>
<p>physics on behalf of humanity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done it twice.</p>
<p>Once in electric cars and once in rocketry.</p>
<p>The problem is that the realm of decision-making at Twitter has nothing</p>
<p>to do with the laws of physics and is governed by emotions and psychology</p>
<p>in which there is no canonically right answer.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s quickly finding out that half the population will always</p>
<p>find fault with him, no matter what he does.</p>
<p>And now the implication of that becomes very important.</p>
<p>We saw yesterday that he had to sell another 3.8 billion dollars of</p>
<p>Tesla stock.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because this transaction, which was, you know, very tight to get</p>
<p>done, probably required lots of margin.</p>
<p>You know, there are I look, I have a margin loan at Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>So I know how these things work and you can very quickly get margin</p>
<p>called.</p>
<p>You have to sell down things that you own in order to maintain your</p>
<p>collateral limits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>He said to do this twice down the last few weeks and that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>again, not because of the demand at Tesla as far as we can tell, but</p>
<p>because people believe he&rsquo;s distracted and so people are anticipating</p>
<p>weakness at Tesla.</p>
<p>People are now shorting the stock.</p>
<p>Anyways, it&rsquo;s causing this downward spiral.</p>
<p>And can you fix it?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Can you pull it all out?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is it just putting himself under an enormous amount of pressure that</p>
<p>he could have avoided?</p>
<p>Somewhat.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think that this is sort of where we&rsquo;re at six weeks in my</p>
<p>God, I was saying this guy learned in six weeks what it took YouTube</p>
<p>seven years to learn how hard it is to moderate content and you know,</p>
<p>I think this is where I disagree is you&rsquo;re attributing so much good</p>
<p>faith to these content moderators at YouTube and Twitter when the</p>
<p>Twitter files reveal that they made no effort to suppress their bias.</p>
<p>In fact, they were like pretty much dancing in the streets every time</p>
<p>they booted off someone they didn&rsquo;t like enough before you react to</p>
<p>what free bird just said at the end that Koda can you respond to what</p>
<p>I just said?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it true?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like well look, I mean if you define what Elon is, you know</p>
<p>doing there as you know, acting as a judge arbitrating on every little</p>
<p>content moderation decision.</p>
<p>Is that a great use of his time relative to what he could be building</p>
<p>at Tesla and SpaceX and doing on behalf of humanity then no clearly</p>
<p>not but if you define what he&rsquo;s doing in the larger sense as restoring</p>
<p>free speech to the most important Town Square social network, hopefully</p>
<p>thereby inspiring other tech companies to move in the direction of</p>
<p>opening things up then I actually think it&rsquo;s a pretty good use of his</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>So look, I think we can quibble about this or that decision that he</p>
<p>makes or this or that tweet, but I think the overall thrust of what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing is very important for the country and for humanity.</p>
<p>So I get where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>Hopefully he&rsquo;ll find some people at Twitter who he can empower and</p>
<p>trust to make these content moderation decisions.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not drawn into every single little battle, right?</p>
<p>We do want him focused on the highest priority problems.</p>
<p>My point is just that I get that.</p>
<p>I just think that what he&rsquo;s learning and what we&rsquo;re living and seeing</p>
<p>in real time is that there is no canonically right decision ever in</p>
<p>this space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a decision where some percentage will support and some</p>
<p>percentage will always be against.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>He did say when he took over he knew that would be the case.</p>
<p>He said you will know I&rsquo;m doing the good job when both sides are equally</p>
<p>upset just to put a pin in it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important for people to understand what the new policy is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to quickly read it just to hang on.</p>
<p>Sorry, hang on one sec before you get to because I think the philosophical</p>
<p>point rather than the specific one is it is an important one and I just</p>
<p>want to respond to what you said and have sacks respond to this in the</p>
<p>case of the points you make around the Twitter files.</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t agree with any of the moderation decisions</p>
<p>personally.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that someone should be suspended for posting public</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think someone should be suspended for saying controversial</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my personal opinion just so I&rsquo;m clear on that because I know that</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s describe yourself as a libertarian speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, libertarian.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And and so in this particular case, I think what really irked me I was</p>
<p>trying to identify why it made me so angry yesterday.</p>
<p>It triggered me.</p>
<p>It really did.</p>
<p>And I think the reason was that in the case of the Twitter file points,</p>
<p>it was a minority.</p>
<p>It was a minority that was affected.</p>
<p>It was one person that was affected because the majority wanted to do</p>
<p>that thing to that person.</p>
<p>And I think in this case, it&rsquo;s that the minority wants to affect the</p>
<p>majority in the sense that Elon has aggregated this control and this</p>
<p>power over moderation, and he&rsquo;s benefiting himself and a few people</p>
<p>that have private planes, and he&rsquo;s shutting down hundreds of tweet feeds</p>
<p>Twitter feeds that are using publicly available information.</p>
<p>And so it feels even more onerous of a use of power and influence because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s taking he&rsquo;s doing something that benefits a small number and</p>
<p>affecting a large larger number.</p>
<p>Whereas the alt whereas the other one was affecting a small number that</p>
<p>benefited a large number because that&rsquo;s what a lot of people wanted to</p>
<p>see happen.</p>
<p>A lot of people wanted to see Trump suspended and it wasn&rsquo;t right either.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, we understand your position completely.</p>
<p>I just want to add to that in this policy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to understand what he is saying about this</p>
<p>accounts dedicated to sharing someone else&rsquo;s live location are going to</p>
<p>be suspended going forward.</p>
<p>You can still share your own location.</p>
<p>Obviously content required, you know content for public engagements, you</p>
<p>know, the president is speaking somewhere whatever you just really</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be persistently consistently tracking an individual otherwise known</p>
<p>and you know, sorry, Jason, if I&rsquo;m talking, but Jason, if NPR is live</p>
<p>tweeting, sure, Jerome Powell speech, perfect.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>XYZ location.</p>
<p>Not a problem.</p>
<p>If they do Jerome Powell&rsquo;s location for the next year for the next year</p>
<p>10 times a week on his off duty on duty.</p>
<p>That is something we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying like, let&rsquo;s just say he gives a speech every week.</p>
<p>Is that illegal?</p>
<p>No, if you&rsquo;re totally fine, if you&rsquo;re giving a speech at a public place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve announced that you&rsquo;re going to be appearing at a certain</p>
<p>time and place, you&rsquo;ve already made public where you&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is and what Elon Jett was showing was a</p>
<p>live stream of precision GPS coordinates over a sustained period</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>Yes, and not to be too dramatic about it.</p>
<p>But if you look at like the weapons are so successfully being used in</p>
<p>Ukraine right now, they&rsquo;re all precision GPS guided.</p>
<p>Now right now you have to be a state actor to get a hold of those weapons,</p>
<p>but you could imagine over the next decade that having someone&rsquo;s precise</p>
<p>GPS coordinates over a sustained period of time.</p>
<p>It would be pretty easy to target them for and not to be dramatic here,</p>
<p>but for assassination.</p>
<p>No, that is a security risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around that.</p>
<p>I brought this up with Palmer Lucky man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared that Duke come at me anytime when I get my jet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want Palmer Lucky taking me out.</p>
<p>Yo Palmer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, dude.</p>
<p>Do not take me out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get my jet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be on my first flight and he&rsquo;s just going to send a drone in.</p>
<p>But look, let&rsquo;s talk about hypocrisy for a second.</p>
<p>Okay, because here we go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about CNN&rsquo;s hypocrisy and the media&rsquo;s hypocrisy because</p>
<p>earlier in the week.</p>
<p>They were saying that any criticism of Yoel Roth who is Twitter&rsquo;s former</p>
<p>head of trust and safety amounted to a threat to his safety and they had</p>
<p>this like theatrical tweet where they claimed he was having to flee his</p>
<p>house, which a lot of people found pretty preposterous.</p>
<p>They were basically saying that public criticism of someone who has put</p>
<p>themselves out there to engage in a public debate who&rsquo;s writing op-eds</p>
<p>New York Times.</p>
<p>That is a threat to safety.</p>
<p>However, publishing someone&rsquo;s real-time location on a continuous basis, so</p>
<p>they can be targeted.</p>
<p>Intellectually consistent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a threat to safety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>If one of those two things is a threat to safety, it&rsquo;s the real-time doxing</p>
<p>of somebody.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think we now understand why Elon did what he did.</p>
<p>He basically had an incident in LA in which the safety of his kid was</p>
<p>threatened because he&rsquo;s got stalkers coming after him.</p>
<p>So his safety is a real issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a made-up issue.</p>
<p>But why should his personal experience affect the usage of the service</p>
<p>that hundreds of millions of people use?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the big issue.</p>
<p>The decision should not be based on what affects him personally.</p>
<p>There needs to be a principle basis.</p>
<p>There needs to be a principle basis for any decision about content</p>
<p>moderation or censorship.</p>
<p>Maybe in the first few hours of that decision, it wasn&rsquo;t handled perfectly</p>
<p>because there wasn&rsquo;t a principle basis.</p>
<p>But since then, one has been put in place.</p>
<p>The principle basis is what J-Cal showed and this applies to everybody.</p>
<p>And so, you know, now it&rsquo;s a debate about whether that policy makes</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>Now, is Elon just as arbitrary and capricious as the former executives</p>
<p>who are running trust and safety at Twitter?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, for two reasons.</p>
<p>Number one, he&rsquo;s promised transparency.</p>
<p>He said that when we ban or shadow ban an account, there has to be a</p>
<p>reason for it and you have to be alerted to it.</p>
<p>In other words, none of the shadow stuff.</p>
<p>No shadow.</p>
<p>You need to be informed.</p>
<p>You get your speeding ticket, you get your ticket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there, right?</p>
<p>No more shadow.</p>
<p>That is different.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is that, and again, I think you could say they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do this perfectly in the first few hours, but there needs to be a</p>
<p>principle basis for a censorship decision and it needs to be applied to</p>
<p>everyone equally.</p>
<p>And so far, we haven&rsquo;t seen any basis for believing that he&rsquo;s not applying</p>
<p>this principle equally.</p>
<p>I mean, still very early.</p>
<p>Whereas the former rulers at Twitter were indulging their personal bias and</p>
<p>personal preferences and who they were banning.</p>
<p>There are two standards of justice.</p>
<p>If you were someone who is allied with them, it was almost impossible to get</p>
<p>censored no matter how hateful your tweets were.</p>
<p>But if you were somebody on the other side of the political debate, they were</p>
<p>eager to suppress you.</p>
<p>And I think that at least so far, Elon has not shown that type of selectivity.</p>
<p>He selected against someone that put him at personal risk.</p>
<p>I think, yes.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s where the decision had stayed, then I would agree with you.</p>
<p>But I think that since then they&rsquo;ve put in place, they&rsquo;ve undergirded that</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>I got to tell you a policy.</p>
<p>I think those sites are I think those tweet streams are cool.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some cool tweets streams that some of these people run and there</p>
<p>are hundreds of them and they&rsquo;re actually kind of cool.</p>
<p>You can see where these different favor of people tracking people&rsquo;s planes like</p>
<p>where Air Force One is they show all these different planes it look and</p>
<p>whether or not the FAA should be publishing the state as a separate</p>
<p>question, but it&rsquo;s on the open internet.</p>
<p>It is already there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like turning off the RSS feed from the open internet to protect himself.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s why it feels onerous.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the part I agree with which is I think this policy with regard to</p>
<p>plane specifically is going to be futile.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be at best harm reduction because as long as there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many ways to publish this information on Reddit, it&rsquo;s on Facebook.</p>
<p>So listen, I think this whole I think this whole policy on Twitter is a</p>
<p>little bit of a red herring.</p>
<p>I think the real issue the real underlying issue is that the FAA is</p>
<p>publishing these icon numbers thereby making every plane personally</p>
<p>identifiable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s I have a counter to it.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m necessary, I have a counter to it actually sacks if I may what we</p>
<p>saw, whether you agree with it or not, with the mass banning of certain</p>
<p>individuals did actually silence them and take them out of the public</p>
<p>square.</p>
<p>One of the reasons in fact, Elon wanted to buy Twitter.</p>
<p>So if you look at certain individuals, whether it&rsquo;s Milo, Alex Jones, Trump</p>
<p>himself, right on down the line when they got banned across all systems,</p>
<p>it was dramatic in terms of the reach of the that information.</p>
<p>So because of the size and scale of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>When they act in coordination, they can have a dramatic impact, not a</p>
<p>perfect impact, but a dramatic which is why we have this issue of hey,</p>
<p>should 230 be rethought?</p>
<p>Because when they act en masse, it is extraordinary what they can do to</p>
<p>an individual.</p>
<p>They took their Alex Joe.</p>
<p>How do you consume Alex Jones?</p>
<p>You have to seek that out in a major way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distinctly different Chamath last word and then we&rsquo;re moving on to</p>
<p>what could be the greatest science corner ever in the history of all in</p>
<p>pod final.</p>
<p>I think this is this is a great transition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to talk about nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>And my point is I don&rsquo;t care about any of this stuff.</p>
<p>Like I said, like this is my point is like the if you if you take like an</p>
<p>average person, okay, you know, we are let&rsquo;s say awake 16 hours a day.</p>
<p>And you know, if you take out the time with our family, David, the family</p>
<p>is people that are related to you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Can we DM sacks those people one more time?</p>
<p>She has that will send you their names.</p>
<p>But if you take that out and you take out, you know, exercising and you</p>
<p>know, we also explain that to sacks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you increase your heart rate and sweat sacks.</p>
<p>The point is that you have let&rsquo;s just call it 12 hours, you know, a</p>
<p>functional executive time that you can apply to a problem and you can break</p>
<p>that down into these blocks, right?</p>
<p>I would really love what is basically the smartest human and the most</p>
<p>productive human of our generation to be filling those blocks with things</p>
<p>that sort of like really transcend and increasingly, and I agree that</p>
<p>freedom of speech is important.</p>
<p>Increasingly, those buckets are being filled with things that are very</p>
<p>low level and hyper tactical and are distractions at best to the to the</p>
<p>path of free speech.</p>
<p>And so I think that hopefully he gets all this shit under control over</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>He finds a good executive team.</p>
<p>I would like to see him get back to landing rockets on barges getting to</p>
<p>Mars.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it.</p>
<p>Get it.</p>
<p>I mean, finish self-driving.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>Chamath definitely has a point.</p>
<p>I would say one of the reasons why we don&rsquo;t care that much about this</p>
<p>issue is because I think something to understand that&rsquo;s important is there</p>
<p>are different kinds of speech and different kinds of speech deserve</p>
<p>different levels of protection.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is like business advertising is not as protected as</p>
<p>political speech.</p>
<p>Porn is not as protected as political speech, political speech, speech</p>
<p>criticizing the people in power is the most protected category of speech</p>
<p>because the founders of the country understood that the people in power</p>
<p>will always try to insulate themselves from accountability by limiting</p>
<p>that kind of speech.</p>
<p>But that is precisely the kind of speech that the former rulers of Twitter</p>
<p>suppress the most and showed the least sensitivity to.</p>
<p>So listen, I mean, is Ilan going to be the perfect content moderator?</p>
<p>No, I mean, nobody is, nobody is, but I do not believe that puts him in the</p>
<p>same category as, you know, Vijaya Gaudi or Yoel Roth, who showed no</p>
<p>sensitivity for political speech.</p>
<p>He has indicated a desire to restore freedom of speech.</p>
<p>And I think they ultimately ended up in a good place.</p>
<p>I want him to get us to Mars.</p>
<p>I want him to get us to Mars.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the best science corner ever.</p>
<p>So according to sources, scientists work for the US government have</p>
<p>achieved a net energy gain in a fusion reaction.</p>
<p>No, no, not net energy gain.</p>
<p>Get it right.</p>
<p>We had ignition energy, which is very different from net energy gain.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I know that you&rsquo;re in the anti camp.</p>
<p>Please let the science nerd have you.</p>
<p>You have to, you have to say it correctly so that people understand what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Let me just make it even simpler than</p>
<p>explain to us what fusion is, Dr.</p>
<p>Friedberg, and explain to us why this could potentially change</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>We did this on a on a show once before, but I&rsquo;ll kind of do a quick</p>
<p>kind of summary again.</p>
<p>Basically, if you take atomic nuclei, which are made of protons and</p>
<p>neutrons, and they repel one another, right, because protons are</p>
<p>positively charged, so they want to push apart from each other.</p>
<p>So with enough energy and enough density, meaning that they&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>fast enough and they&rsquo;re close enough, they&rsquo;ll overcome their repulsion</p>
<p>and jam into each other.</p>
<p>When that happens, some energy is released because the total mass of</p>
<p>the fusion of those nuclei is actually less than those nuclei when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on their own.</p>
<p>And so some energy is released and that energy drives a chain reaction.</p>
<p>And so fusion is this concept that is fundamental to physics and</p>
<p>fundamental to the energy driver of our universe.</p>
<p>So the star in our in our sky, the sun is driven by fusion and only</p>
<p>about 15% of the mass of the sun at the center is dense enough to</p>
<p>actually drive fusion.</p>
<p>So the big challenge with fusion is how do you get these these atomic</p>
<p>nuclei close enough together and moving fast enough that they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually fuse and release energy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super hard.</p>
<p>The reason it happens in the sun is because the sun has so much mass</p>
<p>that the gravity pulls all those particles together, they get close</p>
<p>enough, they get hot enough, they move fast enough, and fusion happens</p>
<p>boom, all this energy comes out and every day we&rsquo;re warm.</p>
<p>Now to do it on Earth is very difficult.</p>
<p>But if we can do it, what happens when you fuse nuclei together is you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t release any this isn&rsquo;t like a radioactive fission reaction.</p>
<p>You release energy that can be harnessed to drive our systems, our</p>
<p>technology.</p>
<p>How is it done?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in the 1950s, you know, this was theorized, hey, we could do fusion</p>
<p>on Earth, we got to get a really, really dense plasma, meaning the</p>
<p>atomic nuclei and the electrons have kind of gone off the atoms.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the nuclei spinning apart, you got to get them to move</p>
<p>super fast, like 10s of millions of degrees Celsius, and you got to get</p>
<p>them really close together.</p>
<p>So how the heck can you do this?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple of concepts to do this, one of which is called</p>
<p>inertial confinement, which is where you basically create a little</p>
<p>pellet of the material, you&rsquo;re going to try and get to fuse, and you</p>
<p>put a ton of energy on the outside, you compress it really hard, really</p>
<p>fast.</p>
<p>And when you compress it really hard, really fast, and you can get it to</p>
<p>be done in a perfect sphere, and you can get it to collapse on itself</p>
<p>very quickly without, you know, kind of shooting all over the place,</p>
<p>enough of those particles will come close enough together fast enough</p>
<p>hot enough, and they will start to fuse.</p>
<p>Another way is through magnetic confinement, where you use magnetic</p>
<p>fields to create a really hot plasma, get it to spin around or to move.</p>
<p>And then the magnet brings that super hot plasma closer and closer and</p>
<p>closer together until all those particles are moving fast.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re dense enough that they start to fuse.</p>
<p>So you know, one is called magnetic confinement, the other ones inertial</p>
<p>confinement.</p>
<p>And so what we saw happen this week is at the National Ignition Facility,</p>
<p>which is a facility that was built starting in 1997.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve spent about three and a half billion dollars to date, they</p>
<p>demonstrated a net energy output from the fusion reaction of an inertial</p>
<p>confinement system.</p>
<p>And what that means is they took a little pellet, and that pellet was made</p>
<p>up of deuterium and tritium, the atomic nuclei that they use the particles</p>
<p>that they use are deuterium, which is a proton and a neutron stuck together.</p>
<p>And then tritium, which is a proton and two neutrons stuck together.</p>
<p>And the reason they use those two combinations is of all the different</p>
<p>ways you could fuse nuclei together.</p>
<p>This has the best energy output of any kind of reaction.</p>
<p>Freiberg, what actually happened this time that made this work for what</p>
<p>apparently only $3 billion.</p>
<p>You said you didn&rsquo;t say 3 trillion said 3 billion, three about a third of</p>
<p>Yeah, about a third of what Sam Bankman fraud stole.</p>
<p>We have done something here.</p>
<p>Yeah, allegedly.</p>
<p>So what actually happened that is so dramatic that we have a press</p>
<p>conference, everybody&rsquo;s losing their mind.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just want to highlight one more thing about why this is so hard.</p>
<p>You have to get such an incredible density, you have to get an incredible</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>So high temperature and high density, that confining those atoms and not</p>
<p>letting them escape and and you know, basically dissolve before they fuse</p>
<p>is super difficult.</p>
<p>It requires so much energy in such a controlled way in such a perfect and</p>
<p>precise way that all of the digital technology, the magnets, all the</p>
<p>measurement systems, all the software, it&rsquo;s taken us decades to get</p>
<p>everything that allows us to do this today.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re at the point that we may be able to start to realize production</p>
<p>scale, kind of versions of this.</p>
<p>So what they did is they had a small deuterium and tritium pellet, and they</p>
<p>shown 192 lasers onto this container that held that little fuel.</p>
<p>Those 192 lasers, the whole thing happened in a billionth of a second,</p>
<p>the lasers pulsed, boom, here&rsquo;s an image of it.</p>
<p>And as they did that, they, you know, basically x rays kind of hit the</p>
<p>sphere, this little BB, if you will, BB kind of thing and compressed it and</p>
<p>it compressed so quickly.</p>
<p>And with such heat, and it didn&rsquo;t dissipate because it was done so</p>
<p>precisely, all the lasers hit at the exact right time, boom, this thing</p>
<p>compressed, and then energy came out.</p>
<p>And the energy that came out that was measured was one and a half times the</p>
<p>energy that kind of went into that reaction.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a chart that that I&rsquo;ll show you from the National Ignition</p>
<p>Facility, which shows just how inefficient the system still is.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t even speaking to to Chamath&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>But basically, these guys lose 90% of the energy that they put into the</p>
<p>center of the system, only 10% is actually used to drive the compression,</p>
<p>the rest of it is lost.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to improve the efficiency of the system from here.</p>
<p>But basically, they put two megajoules in, they got three megajoules out.</p>
<p>And so it was the first proof point production proof point in the 70 years</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been theorizing about nuclear fusion here on planet Earth, that</p>
<p>this is possible, and it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Now, this is these kind of inertial confinement systems.</p>
<p>There are 33 private technology companies today, that have raised about</p>
<p>three to $4 billion so far this year, to pursue several other technologies,</p>
<p>besides what the National Ignition Facility is showing to try and build</p>
<p>production ready versions of nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>And so these 33 companies are using a bunch of different types of tools, one</p>
<p>of which is the tokamak.</p>
<p>If you show the image, I&rsquo;ll show you this one.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, tokamak.</p>
<p>This is what we talked about.</p>
<p>That is the magnetic spinning thing that looks like Iron Man&rsquo;s arc reactor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they based it on Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah, you create a plasma, you basically speed up the hydrogen nuclei super,</p>
<p>super fast, these deuterium and tritium nuclei, super, super fast.</p>
<p>And then you use magnets, and the magnetic field has to precisely squeeze</p>
<p>the plasma, squeezing it, squeezing it, squeezing it.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s slightly off in even the tiniest way, think about a balloon,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>If you put a pinhole in a balloon, everything escapes from the balloon.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how technically hard this is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically trying to create a balloon with a magnetic field, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to keep the gas, and you&rsquo;re trying to make it smaller and</p>
<p>smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>And if any tiny hole emerges, the entire plasma.</p>
<p>Is that what happens in Uranus?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re trying to hold in the Wagyu?</p>
<p>Anyway, let me ask this question then about the consistency of this and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll go to you Chamath.</p>
<p>Can they do it consistently?</p>
<p>Or do you think this is like they got lucky once?</p>
<p>Or are we going to be sitting here a year from now?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, we put in two when we got out six.</p>
<p>So we did it five times.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve proven that humans can do this.</p>
<p>Okay, which is look, I mean, I want to give you guys some and I know kind</p>
<p>of some of Chamath&rsquo;s concerns, which is how humans can recreate the sun</p>
<p>is what we this comes down to.</p>
<p>No, yeah, but guys, no, I want to just say one like, even close.</p>
<p>I want to say one important thing from a historical context, all</p>
<p>breakthrough technology starts out seeming impossibly large, impossibly</p>
<p>expensive and impossibly slow.</p>
<p>The human genome project 20 years ago cost $100 million to sequence the</p>
<p>human genome.</p>
<p>Today, we can do it in a couple of minutes for $100.</p>
<p>Okay, credible.</p>
<p>The first computer, the ENIAC computer had 500 flops of compute capacity.</p>
<p>It filled a room.</p>
<p>It cost $8 million to build 20 years later.</p>
<p>We had a mainframe 20 years later.</p>
<p>All the wrong.</p>
<p>No, this is all this emotional bullshit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using the wrong examples.</p>
<p>Okay, let him finish.</p>
<p>Then you go to my good finish your sentence freeberg.</p>
<p>And then we go.</p>
<p>And today we have an iPhone that can do 2 trillion flops of compute in</p>
<p>your pocket.</p>
<p>I think that what we&rsquo;re seeing with fusion today is similar to what we</p>
<p>saw with the ENIAC computer in the 1950s, which is the demonstration</p>
<p>that compute is possible.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re seeing a demonstration that fusion is possible.</p>
<p>Okay, and a lot of folks have anticipated this moment and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>invested ahead of this.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of these companies that are currently kind of being</p>
<p>built are going to be production ready anytime soon.</p>
<p>My estimate is that we will see production demonstration.</p>
<p>Okay fusion.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>23rd in the 2030s.</p>
<p>So call it eight years from now plus and then you&rsquo;ll see grid scale scale</p>
<p>up in the 2040s.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s going to happen next year or two years</p>
<p>already happening.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now Chamath your rebuttal.</p>
<p>Oh my god, knowing you&rsquo;re a huge fan of solar.</p>
<p>This is the most naval gazing head up your ass scientific bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Okay, couple points.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</p>
<p>The first is that there was no previous technical.</p>
<p>John, why are you being like, why are you angry at me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not angry.</p>
<p>I find this so tiring hearing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all syrup.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing a little triggered.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t get it because I find I don&rsquo;t because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t find this intellectually honest.</p>
<p>Okay, I find it exactly intellectually dishonest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep emotions.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Okay, when you talk about sequencing the genome, there was no alternative.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It was an enormous technical leap forward when we built a computer.</p>
<p>There was no analog.</p>
<p>It was an enormous technical leap.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We have a cost curve.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand and then we iterate as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>And all these innovations where we built an entire infrastructure to</p>
<p>ride down the cost curve.</p>
<p>The thing is fusion energy exists today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the sun.</p>
<p>We actually know how to capture it at virtually no cost right now.</p>
<p>So according to the IAEA today, you can capture grid level solar energy</p>
<p>for about 3 cents a kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as close to zero as we&rsquo;ve ever been and over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Their forecast is it&rsquo;s going to get to one and a half cents.</p>
<p>If you then want to store it and you layer in storage costs will be at a</p>
<p>whopping 3 cents a kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are today.</p>
<p>And so I think that fusion does exist.</p>
<p>I do think that this is an incredible technical leap to replicate something</p>
<p>that exists and I think that&rsquo;s where the intellectual dishonesty is.</p>
<p>It does exist.</p>
<p>It has been captured.</p>
<p>It can be harnessed and there is a positive energy equation just in a</p>
<p>different modality that doesn&rsquo;t speak to these technically minded</p>
<p>individuals.</p>
<p>A couple of other points about what I saw.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible what happened.</p>
<p>Okay, but just to make sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re clear.</p>
<p>This is a hundred and ninety two lasers.</p>
<p>The size of three football fields.</p>
<p>That consumed three hundred and twenty two megajoules of energy, which</p>
<p>then ultimately deliver two megajoules to a target which then released</p>
<p>three.</p>
<p>So this is why I&rsquo;m saying we had positive what&rsquo;s called ignition energy.</p>
<p>We did not have positive electrical energy captured.</p>
<p>So yeah, could we figure this out?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Can we then shrink the three football fields down to something that looks</p>
<p>the size of a laptop?</p>
<p>We possibly could will it take 20 or 30 years possibly but in the</p>
<p>meanwhile, if the goal is unlimited costless energy, you&rsquo;re on that</p>
<p>cost curve already.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why can&rsquo;t it be both?</p>
<p>So you said I was being intellectually dishonest.</p>
<p>What was I was dishonest?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re comparing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying what you&rsquo;re saying is right.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get you.</p>
<p>You seem to be an agreement.</p>
<p>Like yeah, I just think that I think that you&rsquo;re trying to say that</p>
<p>this is an entirely new thing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a different approach to a thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already beaten and basically captured.</p>
<p>Let me bring what I would argue to mop.</p>
<p>And I think this is important be the net energy you can capture on say</p>
<p>a football field sized facility from solar is, you know, a tiny fraction</p>
<p>of the energy you could generate from a football field sized fusion</p>
<p>reactor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the argument would be like, hey, you know, when we were</p>
<p>developing computers, hey, we have abacus is we shouldn&rsquo;t be developing</p>
<p>computers.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the analogy I would use here.</p>
<p>This is why the cost per kilowatt hour is what the the levelized cost</p>
<p>of energy tries to do.</p>
<p>It tries to to normalize that argument away because everybody would</p>
<p>say that.</p>
<p>Hey, hold on a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to need plane fulls of this or boatloads of that and</p>
<p>people said no.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the levelized cost of energy?</p>
<p>How what is the cost per kilowatt hour to generate energy?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying is that is an absolute scale and free is zero.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re at 1.5 cents.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I would say once check out one sec.</p>
<p>Okay, come off.</p>
<p>The opportunity here is not necessarily about cost reduction.</p>
<p>It is about scalability.</p>
<p>And if hydrogen is abundant, which it is on this planet, it is nearly</p>
<p>infinitely abundant.</p>
<p>We can take that hydrogen and we can scale up energy and electricity</p>
<p>production in a way that is unimaginable compared to solar.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that solar should be excluded.</p>
<p>Solar is key today and should be scaled up and I&rsquo;m 100% agreement with</p>
<p>you, but the scalability to go 100x if we want to make 100 times more</p>
<p>electricity, I think we need fusion and I think that it&rsquo;s feasible.</p>
<p>So I think we have reached a good settlement here.</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;re saying hey, listen, we&rsquo;re getting solar down.</p>
<p>So cheap.</p>
<p>We can solve this problem all forms of energy.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>We are solving that.</p>
<p>So for our needs today and then what Freeberg is saying, but what if</p>
<p>you had unlimited a thing that we can&rsquo;t even imagine beautiful now</p>
<p>watch as I get sacks involved in a science conversation.</p>
<p>He has zero interest in Mr.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>If in fact there was 100% more free electricity available in this time</p>
<p>frame the next 10 to 200 X 100 X the available energy in other words</p>
<p>supply of energy just becomes flooded and it&rsquo;s free essentially what</p>
<p>would be the geopolitical reaction on planet Earth in terms of</p>
<p>this incredible rivalry rivalry.</p>
<p>We have with China and for humanity on a political basis such a good</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Jacob.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>World&rsquo;s greatest moderate TM.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we let Freeberg answer?</p>
<p>No, no, but you&rsquo;re the politics guy.</p>
<p>Get in there.</p>
<p>Take a second to think it through already has thought about this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s I want to hear his answer.</p>
<p>No, I want you.</p>
<p>I actually want to hear your answer.</p>
<p>Yes, you know in a world where you know energy becomes more abundant</p>
<p>David hasn&rsquo;t been paying attention guys.</p>
<p>This is what he&rsquo;s trying to say.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we just on a group thread with Tucker?</p>
<p>Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
<p>Can I just say?</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll call your intellectual dishonesty and raise you a steel</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I love you sexy.</p>
<p>So, you know, I do.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I had a great night on Monday night, a Sunday night.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk later.</p>
<p>I just want to be great.</p>
<p>I need to get drunk together.</p>
<p>Last week.</p>
<p>He called me petty too.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re well, here&rsquo;s what I want to be clear.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;m just glad that you guys are fighting not me and</p>
<p>sacks guys, please.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think that this breakthrough is really valuable.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to see that these kinds of scientific</p>
<p>breakthroughs continue to happen in government-sponsored facilities</p>
<p>and not private companies.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s probably where a lot of these innovations</p>
<p>will continue to come from because look at the scale of what had</p>
<p>to be built three football fields and 322 megajoules of energy and</p>
<p>192 lasers.</p>
<p>This is really complicated expensive stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an enormous fan of these kinds of scientific breakthroughs.</p>
<p>I want to be clear.</p>
<p>I think that where I struggle is translating this into actually an</p>
<p>investable area and I worry that this is going to consume lots of</p>
<p>money by folks that could otherwise put money to work in things that</p>
<p>will actually pull forward our energy independence and energy</p>
<p>abundance sooner and faster.</p>
<p>So for example, you know, there are all kinds of things that we could</p>
<p>do to secondary ternary third and fourth and fifth generation batteries</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t happening today.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of things that we could do to actually create an</p>
<p>infrastructure of green hydrogen and the the simplistic answer is we</p>
<p>could do it all but the reality is money is finite and we can&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;m observing is I do think that more practical things that do</p>
<p>have geopolitical ramifications sooner are not going to get funded</p>
<p>because people do get enraptured by this and my skepticism is that</p>
<p>this is still in the realm of government-sponsored research and is</p>
<p>not really an area that for-profit private companies can tackle and so</p>
<p>I would rather those for-profit companies, for example, Y Combinator</p>
<p>just today put out something where they were, you know, call to action</p>
<p>a request for startups in climate and when you look at that list, those</p>
<p>are really practical investable areas and I just want to make sure that</p>
<p>the capital allocators that listen to this weigh those equally.</p>
<p>I am glad I&rsquo;m glad that the US government did this.</p>
<p>I hope they do more of this, but if you&rsquo;re asking me quite honestly, I</p>
<p>would rather the next 10 billion dollars go into energy efficiency</p>
<p>HVAC then fusion because a fusion exists and B.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to happen at an innovative bench scale level by the</p>
<p>government and not by a particle.</p>
<p>Let me just let me just respond to that real quick.</p>
<p>I think that the idea of allocating our resources as a society should</p>
<p>be done on kind of, you know, on a portfolio basis 80% on the pragmatic</p>
<p>near-term 15% on the kind of next-gen and 5% on the moonshot and this</p>
<p>maybe starts to shift from the 5% to the 15% maybe it&rsquo;s still in the</p>
<p>5% but I don&rsquo;t see kind of over funding happening.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you guys there was a survey done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 33 private companies in fusion that are kind of fusion companies</p>
<p>today VC back eight new this year.</p>
<p>So the number is kind of increased by 33% this year and so far this year</p>
<p>those companies have raised around three to four billion dollars, which</p>
<p>by the way is a fraction of what was done by 15-minute delivery companies</p>
<p>for convenience stores exactly my point and and by the way, the biggest</p>
<p>funding is happening in I tear which is the largest construction project</p>
<p>in Europe.</p>
<p>And this is a 30 billion dollar production scale fusion demonstration</p>
<p>system that should be online by the end of the 2020s government</p>
<p>sponsored government sponsored.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so to my point, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of government sponsored</p>
<p>research.</p>
<p>Now we get finally the first science corner.</p>
<p>Everybody brace themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first science corner where David Sachs has a lot of the cherry</p>
<p>sacks.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You can come in and you can do it.</p>
<p>Mr.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>What was your thoughts on this question?</p>
<p>Your question was a little bit was was not a let me rephrase.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on coming in.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the geopolitical impact if this does happen 100x energy is</p>
<p>fantastic for the United States if it actually happens and the reason</p>
<p>is if you look across the world, there&rsquo;s this thing in politics known</p>
<p>as resource curse where the worst governments the most despotic</p>
<p>governments tend to be in the countries that have the biggest natural</p>
<p>resources ironically.</p>
<p>So the countries that have huge amounts of petroleum or other kinds</p>
<p>of minerals, they&rsquo;ve tend to have pretty corrupt governments.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that if you&rsquo;re sitting on a giant oil</p>
<p>reserve, you don&rsquo;t need to make anything else work.</p>
<p>You just fight over who gets control that oil reserve and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>politics ends up being.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to create policies that foster innovation or attract</p>
<p>knowledge workers, right?</p>
<p>You just basically mind that oil.</p>
<p>So if all of a sudden you&rsquo;re talking about turning energy into a software</p>
<p>problem or an innovation problem that looks a lot more like the software</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an area where the United States has a huge advantage.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think it would pull the rug out from under many countries</p>
<p>all over the world in favor of the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a big if because where I agree with Chamath is this stuff</p>
<p>still seems pretty far off and it&rsquo;s still pretty unproven from a</p>
<p>commercial standpoint, but I agree with Freeberg.</p>
<p>Why not try investing in and cultivating and see where it goes.</p>
<p>Okay, fantastic.</p>
<p>This was a fantastic science corner where we actually engaged David</p>
<p>Sachs, which country did you find anything to disagree with their</p>
<p>J Cal?</p>
<p>All right, take it easy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just want to let you do that.</p>
<p>I think you like that answer, right?</p>
<p>Well, I love all of your intellectual enough for you or was I love your</p>
<p>intellectually?</p>
<p>I love it wasn&rsquo;t a steel person felt silver silver silver manning, but</p>
<p>I love what you&rsquo;re intellectually on a silver person.</p>
<p>Yes, your silver veying your silver thing was on a plot.</p>
<p>Was that platinum gold or silver?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s your you&rsquo;re in platinum with some diamond dust.</p>
<p>I think the fact that I just can I just say spent a couple nights</p>
<p>together this past week has really really does the mood of the show.</p>
<p>I mean when you guys go out and drink together and have fun.</p>
<p>You guys are exactly I left our asses off Sunday night.</p>
<p>Can I just say we Saxon I had the best 48 hours together in a decade.</p>
<p>This is Sunday night.</p>
<p>It turns out Chris Rock and Chappelle are playing at the Chase</p>
<p>Center where Chamath used to own a piece of the Warriors, right?</p>
<p>And this incredible arena has this incredible show and you know, me</p>
<p>and Saxon some friends will leave it at that go to the show.</p>
<p>Our bestie Draymond is at the show.</p>
<p>So I text Dre and I&rsquo;m like, hey, you&rsquo;re going to see Chris Rock</p>
<p>by chance tonight with Chappelle say yes, sir.</p>
<p>I said, hey, I&rsquo;m going to go with a couple of friends.</p>
<p>Maybe we roll together hang out after the show.</p>
<p>We go.</p>
<p>And after the game after the show, which was incredible, we go</p>
<p>backstage and I&rsquo;m sorry to the to the practice court and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hanging out with Draymond in the practice court with Dave Chappelle</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle and I start shooting hoops.</p>
<p>David Saxe is talking to Chris Rock about free speech.</p>
<p>Steph Curry comes out and starts giving Dave Chappelle and Jake</p>
<p>how shooting lessons where Chappelle and I are breaking like old</p>
<p>men, you know, you know on a concrete court all of a sudden Steph</p>
<p>says, hey Jake, how you got it?</p>
<p>And by the way, he&rsquo;s fan of the show says you&rsquo;re short every time</p>
<p>and just, you know, hit the backboard.</p>
<p>You got to go long.</p>
<p>Then he tells Chappelle that you got to change this all of a sudden</p>
<p>we start hitting shots.</p>
<p>Like, you know, we&rsquo;re on the raining threes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re raining threes.</p>
<p>It was literally like cut into here were these mid-range jumpers</p>
<p>or threes.</p>
<p>I was a free throw line extended free throw line extended cut into</p>
<p>here rain man and rain dance from along came Polly rain dance</p>
<p>rainman.</p>
<p>Let it rain!</p>
<p>Rain dance!</p>
<p>Let it rain!</p>
<p>Let it rain!</p>
<p>I was hitting brick after brick rest in peace Philip Seymour</p>
<p>Hoffman.</p>
<p>So then we&rsquo;re chilling.</p>
<p>And Saxe and I are talking to Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>Joe Lakeham owner of the Warriors are there the majority owner,</p>
<p>you know, as opposed to you being a minority owner.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>The only person who drops more names is Phil Hellmuth.</p>
<p>I mean, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to catch up anymore.</p>
<p>No, he is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving out ten names.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only got three names.</p>
<p>Saxe.</p>
<p>Saxe.</p>
<p>Am I leaving out ten names?</p>
<p>So bad, but I&rsquo;m not going to say anything.</p>
<p>Not doxing anybody.</p>
<p>So brutal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be zero doxing.</p>
<p>So we, I kid you not.</p>
<p>Chappelle comes over and says,</p>
<p>Jacob, Saxe, you guys want to go to after to do a go see me do a</p>
<p>show at like 1 a.m.</p>
<p>At this like local comedy club with 70 seats.</p>
<p>I said word.</p>
<p>Yes, we go at 1 a.m.</p>
<p>Chappelle sits on stage smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>And doing 90 second pauses and then having a beer and interacting</p>
<p>with the audience and does a two-hour set after doing this</p>
<p>set with Chris Rock at the Chase Center.</p>
<p>Me and Saxe and Draymond hilariously laughing.</p>
<p>The stuff Chappelle is a genius.</p>
<p>And when you see his show and Chris Rock, by the way, he puts</p>
<p>a tight set together.</p>
<p>I mean Chappelle&rsquo;s got this storytelling thing where he kind</p>
<p>of meanders a little bit and then he hits you with it.</p>
<p>But Chris Rock is just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,</p>
<p>Extraordinary just two incredible minds at the top of their game</p>
<p>artists artists at the top of their game doing what society</p>
<p>needs.</p>
<p>But more importantly doing what David Saxon I needed which was</p>
<p>to laugh our asses off together and remember our friendship.</p>
<p>So it was a great night out.</p>
<p>I want to say to bestie Draymond Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>The David Saxe Jake house bestie friendship has never been</p>
<p>stronger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Friedberg and Chamath that seems to be on</p>
<p>the rocks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be in there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be we&rsquo;ll be we&rsquo;ll be vacationing together next week.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll I love I love Friedberg.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, well, we are going to be whatever whatever&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take a walk and figure it out.</p>
<p>Well, I just want to say the alliances amongst the besties</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>I got mad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>I got mad at Friedberg when he edited that Google bit to say</p>
<p>the exact opposite of what he actually said that yeah, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring that up.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t bring that up.</p>
<p>Yeah, just beep that.</p>
<p>But yes, that is the thing that bothered me.</p>
<p>I have to be honest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s you playing to the crowd versus you being honest and</p>
<p>telling what you think.</p>
<p>Freebird.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Let me put that in the form of a question.</p>
<p>Freeberg has your fame as the sultan of science.</p>
<p>Because listen, you nobody knew who you were outside of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley before this.</p>
<p>Look, you guys it impacted your ability to speak.</p>
<p>No, no, no, not my family.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll be I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll speak openly about this.</p>
<p>I had said that there could probably be a significant head</p>
<p>count reduction of like 75% at Google, and the business could</p>
<p>keep operating.</p>
<p>And I took it out.</p>
<p>And I took it out because I have a lot of friends that work at</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>Google is a close partner of mine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an investor of mine.</p>
<p>And frankly, I just want to be careful about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I commonly do, you know, as you guys know,</p>
<p>I usually speak my mind pretty clearly, but I was just trying</p>
<p>to be respectful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason I did it, you know, so that was fine.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is not that it&rsquo;s just that the part that you</p>
<p>edited in actually made it seem like you were not saying that</p>
<p>at all, but the opposite.</p>
<p>I think if you had cut the whole thing, it would have been more</p>
<p>honest.</p>
<p>So to keep that other thing in actually led the perception of</p>
<p>the opposite.</p>
<p>So you were triggered by that.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t have triggered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, but I think we should have a principle.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on, guys.</p>
<p>Very often tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you like, yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I think that we should just have a principle to not play to what</p>
<p>the perception of what we say should be especially if it means</p>
<p>we could be saying the opposite of what we actually mean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Intellectual honesty is a bestie tenant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bestie tenant.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Bestie 10 always and the other bestie tenant besties always come</p>
<p>back together.</p>
<p>If we have a fight, we always come back together.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>Can I&rsquo;m still mad at you a little bit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Okay, but just talking about hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I mean, so how great was Sunday night?</p>
<p>How great gets up there and he gives like right out of the gate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s attacking woke right out of the gate swinging came out swinging</p>
<p>like Will Smith.</p>
<p>Suge Smith, you mean?</p>
<p>Suge Smith.</p>
<p>He took down Will Smith.</p>
<p>I mean the Will Smith takedown which you will see in this special</p>
<p>is so complete.</p>
<p>It is just chef&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
<p>But how great was his set?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say just give Chris Rock his flower.</p>
<p>He did he did he fillet and fricassee?</p>
<p>He he did but I thought the more important part of the set was the</p>
<p>it came right out like calling out all this, you know, you know,</p>
<p>earlier than thou woke stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And and there was an undercurrent to Chappelle&rsquo;s set as well.</p>
<p>And also he said listen words can&rsquo;t hurt you unless you write them</p>
<p>on a piece of paper and time to a brick.</p>
<p>We these a bigger point right now and this does tie into our first</p>
<p>story is I think comedians look at Twitter as a place to get cancelled</p>
<p>not a place to be part of the discourse and that&rsquo;s a huge loss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s indicative of our society being broken and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredibly important that these comedians be allowed to mock and</p>
<p>to speak and to step over the line and challenge us as citizens in</p>
<p>a free society and we should cherish them and we should not even</p>
<p>try to cancel them.</p>
<p>Let them cross the line.</p>
<p>Let them say things that make us uncomfortable so that we can</p>
<p>understand ourselves and our society better and I just want to</p>
<p>say why can&rsquo;t you include lives of tick-tock in that?</p>
<p>Oh, do we want to have a discussion about it?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next conversation about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just asking you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with mocking.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t start you guys.</p>
<p>You did so well.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>No, Jake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cut it out.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, we have two more science corners to get to.</p>
<p>All right, if you don&rsquo;t want I mean, I just know let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>the Coupa deal and sacks.</p>
<p>This is right up your alley.</p>
<p>Have you ever paid attention to it?</p>
<p>To be honest, I really the thing you guys asked is like, you know,</p>
<p>what signal will Elon&rsquo;s moves at Twitter be for the rest of the</p>
<p>tech industry?</p>
<p>I think the biggest wake-up call is to actually PE companies.</p>
<p>So if you played this out and you think that Coupa is, you know,</p>
<p>explain what kind of test plays Coupa is a is a software as a</p>
<p>service company that does revenue management, I guess or expense</p>
<p>forecasting or some something in the financial realm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly know to be honest.</p>
<p>But anyways, this is a company that you know was off 70 or 80% from</p>
<p>the high like a lot of SAS companies were when rates started to go</p>
<p>up and they got this offer from from Toma Bravo.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting about this deal.</p>
<p>If you think that you know, these guys bought a company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to make up a number at 20 times EBITDA, right?</p>
<p>And and you see Elon at Twitter and you think well wait, maybe we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t cut 75% but maybe we can cut 50% headcount and the company</p>
<p>can still do well and you know, you take half of the expenses out</p>
<p>of the business all of a sudden, you know, if you&rsquo;re EBITDA doubles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually buying it at 10 times.</p>
<p>So I think the thing that is the that is the real insight here is</p>
<p>twofold private equity can still put out a lot of private credit</p>
<p>to fund these deals and SAS companies are perfect because they</p>
<p>have huge free cash flow, right?</p>
<p>So instead of funding it based on earnings, they can fund it based</p>
<p>on ACV and ARR so private equity will be super active and to all</p>
<p>these rifts basically show what the efficient frontier is for the</p>
<p>number of employees you need to run a company and if you can cut</p>
<p>50% of the headcount private equity folks will do that.</p>
<p>And so I think Koopa is like the canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>It is the beginning of what I suspect is a tidal wave of PE</p>
<p>sponsored deals in tech companies, largely SAS, but may go into</p>
<p>other realms.</p>
<p>Recurring revenue that can go advantage of these two things tap</p>
<p>the private credit markets and finance it based on ARR and then</p>
<p>fire 50% of the team and double earnings capacity.</p>
<p>Zach, your thoughts.</p>
<p>So on Koopa, I thought the most interesting thing was just the</p>
<p>we got a public comp.</p>
<p>Well, we got a comp on what private equity is paying for public</p>
<p>companies right now.</p>
<p>So the deal happened at an $8 billion valuation.</p>
<p>That was a 31% premium to the public price.</p>
<p>It was 8.4 times next 12 months revenue and on a trailing basis.</p>
<p>It was about 10.4 times the last 12 months revenue.</p>
<p>And by the way, all the comments were around how what a rich price</p>
<p>Tomo Bravo was paying.</p>
<p>People generally thought they were paying a premium to the</p>
<p>valuation.</p>
<p>So it was 77% premium before the rumors came out that this was</p>
<p>happening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty big premium.</p>
<p>Yeah, good point.</p>
<p>And there was and there was a there was a bidding war with</p>
<p>Vista.</p>
<p>And so it was a it was a really rich kind of deal that got done</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So my point is that people thought this was a really rich deal and</p>
<p>yet the valuation multiples are so much lower than what private</p>
<p>company founders expect.</p>
<p>So remember last year at, you know, the peak founders were</p>
<p>thinking a hundred times ARR was normal a hundred times and you</p>
<p>know, you could roughly say, you know, ARR is roughly equivalent</p>
<p>to next 12 months revenue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s roughly the case.</p>
<p>So these founders were expecting evaluation multiple 10 times</p>
<p>what the public markets are paying and the public more and</p>
<p>actually the public markets are half of where Tomo Bravo was in</p>
<p>this particular deal.</p>
<p>So the public markets right now are valuing.</p>
<p>The median SAS company at about five and a half times and a high</p>
<p>growth, but that&rsquo;d be for like a 20% year over year growing</p>
<p>company and they&rsquo;re valuing the high growth companies that may</p>
<p>be eight times, you know, and Tomo Bravo did this at 10 times.</p>
<p>So that gives you a sense of what the ballpark is.</p>
<p>And these are companies that are already public.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at scale.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing roughly a billion dollars of ARR.</p>
<p>They have already kind of won their category to some degree.</p>
<p>Whereas private companies are subscale.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, typically you&rsquo;re talking about companies</p>
<p>with 1, 5, 10, usually under 20 million dollars of ARR.</p>
<p>They are, they&rsquo;re not de-risked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a ton of risk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen many, many SAS companies fizzle out and plateau</p>
<p>at 20 million of ARR, never get to a hundred million, never mind</p>
<p>a billion.</p>
<p>And yet these founders think that they&rsquo;re entitled to, you</p>
<p>know, even in this market, 30 to 40 times ARR, no way.</p>
<p>I mean, like it&rsquo;s getting to the point now where, you know,</p>
<p>maybe it should be 10 times, 20 times like max for, and that</p>
<p>would be for a company that&rsquo;s growing two and a half, three</p>
<p>X year over year.</p>
<p>So I still think that like, so I think basically what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing here is even a good scenario, like a coupe acquisition</p>
<p>that was done at a premium, like it&rsquo;s still a wake-up call to</p>
<p>the private markets that the valuations are still completely</p>
<p>and utterly out of whack.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question, Zach.</p>
<p>So this company was growing 45% last year.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re growing 35% this year and they got this multiple.</p>
<p>Why is it not worth a significantly higher multiple?</p>
<p>If a company is growing two and a half to three X, which is</p>
<p>250%, 300% and these guys are only growing 35%.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it is and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re paying a premium for.</p>
<p>But so the, so the, here&rsquo;s the theory of it is that if you</p>
<p>can invest in a private company that say tripling year over</p>
<p>year and they can do that for another five years or whatever,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re paying for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying for that outcome in a couple years, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically, well, think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a discount to the outcome in a couple years.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re paying 30 times today and it triples next</p>
<p>year, you&rsquo;re only paying 10 times next year.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s again, you&rsquo;re only paying three times.</p>
<p>So if that keeps going, that&rsquo;s where your arbitrage is.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing you have to weigh against.</p>
<p>That is that these early stage private companies, many things</p>
<p>go wrong and they hit a plateau.</p>
<p>They fizzle out or their growth rate starts to the bigger they</p>
<p>get, the harder they should be priced at a discount, not a</p>
<p>premium because there&rsquo;s risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more risk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re growing faster, but there&rsquo;s more risk.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Once you get to a bigger number of ARR 50, 100 million of ARR,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to be doubling or tripling year over</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>Let me just point one thing out.</p>
<p>So I looked at the numbers on Coupa.</p>
<p>I think they had about 170 million of stock based comp expense</p>
<p>in the last nine months.</p>
<p>So those are employees that are getting $170 million in</p>
<p>compensation in the form of shares.</p>
<p>So they get those shares.</p>
<p>They can then sell those shares and get cash for them on the</p>
<p>public market and then on the public markets and pay their</p>
<p>bills.</p>
<p>So when a company like this goes private for those employees to</p>
<p>just remain at their baseline comp, that stock based comp needs</p>
<p>to be replaced with something else or else they&rsquo;re seeing their</p>
<p>salaries reduced.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s this balancing game when these companies</p>
<p>go private in terms of how do you give them the comp that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>earning to keep them engaged in the business?</p>
<p>The answer is you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Versus no, but you let them quit because you want to do a riff</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I mean, but for the people that stay, right, so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>balance because it&rsquo;s not just, hey, cut the OPEX, you have to</p>
<p>cut the OPEX, including stock based comp, and this company</p>
<p>generated about $100,000,000, sorry, $210,000,000 of free cash</p>
<p>flow or operating cash flow in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you if you take out the stock based comp, these guys are</p>
<p>actually breakeven or losing money, roughly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m growing break even roughly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real question mark on this business and businesses</p>
<p>like this that go private, where if you actually cut the OPEX and</p>
<p>you cut the salaries and you cut the headcount, but you have to</p>
<p>find new ways to pay people, because you&rsquo;ve been paying them</p>
<p>with stock in the past, how do you kind of bridge that gap?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably a little bit of the balance and</p>
<p>the art of what these guys do.</p>
<p>Well, Jamal, if I may, can you explain to the audience, what a</p>
<p>private equity firms expectation is in terms of return when they</p>
<p>buy a company like this, and then sacks, I saw your tweet that</p>
<p>you want to feature and you&rsquo;ll go next.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Jamal.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s changed over time.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s so powerful about the private equity</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>Look, you have to think about what their incentive is because</p>
<p>it kind of guides the out.</p>
<p>Yes, early on.</p>
<p>They were very much like venture capitalists.</p>
<p>They were out in the, you know, edges of risk-taking doing all</p>
<p>kinds of very difficult gnarly deals.</p>
<p>So if you look back in the history of private equity, you know,</p>
<p>these huge crazy deals like RGR Nabisco or TWA Airlines were the</p>
<p>first of the industry and they weeped enormous returns, but there</p>
<p>was a lot of risk and it required very heavy-handed management.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, what that meant was firing a lot of people.</p>
<p>Over time, private equity has gotten institutionalized and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t generally</p>
<p>feature themselves as a place to get the best necessarily returns,</p>
<p>but they are places where you can put enormous amounts of money</p>
<p>where the likelihood of loss is extremely zero and you generate</p>
<p>very good rates of return.</p>
<p>Now, again, this depends on whether you want to look at IRR or DPI,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So a lot of people will market IRR.</p>
<p>Which, you know, I think is kind of like a gameable metric, but you</p>
<p>know, those IRRs can be 20-25%.</p>
<p>If you look at DPI, which is really how much cash you get back, you</p>
<p>know, private equity firms can generate one and a half to 2x of the</p>
<p>money you give them, but they do it consistently and they very rarely</p>
<p>lose money.</p>
<p>So all of that is important into understanding what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>in this cycle.</p>
<p>These folks are going to buy a ton of these private software companies.</p>
<p>I think that they are going to fire lots of people.</p>
<p>I think they are going to make these companies run hyper-efficiently</p>
<p>and they will make sure that they generate that 1.2 to 1.7x that has</p>
<p>been historical.</p>
<p>Very rarely will they lose money in these things.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s going to mean that a lot of these other companies</p>
<p>will have to reset valuation.</p>
<p>So you saw yesterday, Checkout.com went from a $40 billion valuation</p>
<p>down to 11.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing some companies only go down 10 or 15%.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a process, isn&rsquo;t it, Shamath?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just like what happens in real estate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of this process.</p>
<p>Yes, because in real estate, my understanding, having lived through</p>
<p>these boom-bust cycles, is the person living in the home still believes</p>
<p>their home is worth this incredible valuation.</p>
<p>And then the people who want to buy it are like, that doesn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>And then the real estate brokers go back and forth trying to get people</p>
<p>to go through this messy middle and come to true price discovery.</p>
<p>A private company, it&rsquo;s hard to get true price discovery until they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the brink of insolvency.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
<p>We just got some data on that, actually.</p>
<p>Can we bring this Cooley data in?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Cooley looked at- A law firm in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re a prominent Silicon Valley law firm.</p>
<p>They looked at a thousand deals over the last three quarters of this</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>And what they saw is that the later the stage, the bigger the</p>
<p>valuation correction.</p>
<p>So Series D rounds went from $3.5 billion to $527 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an 85%.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an 85% drop.</p>
<p>Series C went from $502 million to $130 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a 74% drop.</p>
<p>Series B went from $164 million to $90 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a 45% drop.</p>
<p>And then Series A went from $58 million to $45 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only a 22% drop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just less room to compress there.</p>
<p>But the point is that Series B, roughly a 50% drop.</p>
<p>Series C, roughly a 3 quarters drop.</p>
<p>And Series D, roughly a 85%.</p>
<p>Yeah, 1 7th drop.</p>
<p>So I think founders right now are they&rsquo;re just like a little bit</p>
<p>delusional about this money they raised last year.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still way too anchored on last year&rsquo;s valuation.</p>
<p>And if only they would think in terms of this capital they raised</p>
<p>last year in terms of of its real dilution in terms of what the</p>
<p>company is worth now, I think they&rsquo;d be treating it more more</p>
<p>precious.</p>
<p>So for example, for example, hold on if you won the lottery and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to they don&rsquo;t realize they won the lottery.</p>
<p>I had this conversation with the founder.</p>
<p>This is the only money they&rsquo;re ever going to see is the bottom</p>
<p>line and they&rsquo;re spending like they&rsquo;re going to win the lottery</p>
<p>every year.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s say you take a company.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say you take a company that raised $200 million last</p>
<p>year at $2 billion.</p>
<p>So it was 10% dilution.</p>
<p>So in their heads, they&rsquo;re thinking, oh, well, this isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>expensive. Like 10% dilution is a rounding error.</p>
<p>But really, probably the company is worth maybe $400 million now,</p>
<p>right? Because it&rsquo;s gone down 80%.</p>
<p>This $200 million of your $400 million is half the value of the</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>Yes, and you&rsquo;re squandering it, you&rsquo;re squandering it at a rate</p>
<p>of $100 million a year.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically burning up 25% of the value of your company</p>
<p>this year and the next year.</p>
<p>And then by the way, you&rsquo;re going to be in crisis after that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re probably like a lottery winner buying like a</p>
<p>giant superyacht.</p>
<p>I had an observation that a lot of the investors that sit on the</p>
<p>boards of these companies.</p>
<p>They have an incentive to not see those valuations come down</p>
<p>too quickly, do they not?</p>
<p>And so there is this sort of like interest in hey, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you to have to go reprice the company or do a down round because</p>
<p>then my portfolio gets written down and then I&rsquo;m in the middle</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s always in the middle of a fundraising cycle with LPs.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to have a tough conversation with my LPs about</p>
<p>my my value.</p>
<p>So do you not see VCs and investors playing an active role in trying</p>
<p>to keep the valuations propped up to some extent, particularly</p>
<p>where they have big markups 100% either by extending bridge</p>
<p>rounds or doing other sorts of, you know,</p>
<p>look, nobody, nobody likes to go through a down round.</p>
<p>And that includes founders and existing investors in the</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>That being said, we&rsquo;re not talking here about new financing</p>
<p>conversations we&rsquo;re talking about is advice that is happening</p>
<p>in board meetings.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe other VCs aren&rsquo;t pushing as hard as we are,</p>
<p>but you the advice I&rsquo;m giving in board meetings is what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you publicly today, which is this is the last money you</p>
<p>may be able to raise on attractive terms.</p>
<p>If at all, you need to treat it much more preciously.</p>
<p>The world has fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>And by the way, we haven&rsquo;t even gotten into what&rsquo;s coming the</p>
<p>demand contraction that&rsquo;s coming next year.</p>
<p>Explain what demand contract construction is for the audience</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s going to be three major sources of slowdown for</p>
<p>software companies next year.</p>
<p>Number one new business is going to dry up companies are just</p>
<p>going to be spending a lot less money next year because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all cutting costs.</p>
<p>So you should expect your new business to be roughly 50% of</p>
<p>what it was next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be 50% of what it was last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my rule of thumb for most companies new business down</p>
<p>50% number two churn is going to be higher.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen that much logo churn yet, but next year a lot</p>
<p>of companies are going to start going out of business and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen over the next two years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re simply going to see logo churn rates say among small</p>
<p>businesses go from like a historical norm of 15% to maybe</p>
<p>25 or 30.</p>
<p>In other words, your customer the logo is simply not going to</p>
<p>exist.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to go means.</p>
<p>Yes, the actual answer is yes logo churn means the entity</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got seat contraction, which is these companies are</p>
<p>not hiring as fast.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re doing layoffs.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re simply not going to buy as many seats of your software</p>
<p>as you need to in the past for the last decade.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a tailwind an enormous tailwind for software companies</p>
<p>of seat expansion, which is every year your existing customers</p>
<p>would buy more seats of your product for their new employees.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re actually going to have fewer employees or maybe</p>
<p>headcount freezes.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually buying my God, by the way, if you if you</p>
<p>take all those three things the deal of the century was figma</p>
<p>selling to Adobe for 20, sir, because if you take those three</p>
<p>things, I mean, oh my god, they just absolutely top tick before</p>
<p>any of this stuff was no totally.</p>
<p>So today Adobe could probably buy this thing for like 7 billion</p>
<p>instead of 20 billion.</p>
<p>So does that mean they try to do a breakup fee and get out of</p>
<p>the deal?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if I was if I was figma, I try to close this thing ASAP</p>
<p>and get that money.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>And by the way, what I&rsquo;m seeing from founders is that they still</p>
<p>want to grow 100% plus over the next year.</p>
<p>The problem is that the headwinds are going to be intense.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re applying a plane and the headwinds are extremely</p>
<p>intense, and you try to maintain your speed, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>burn an enormous amount of fuel, you&rsquo;re going to be incredibly</p>
<p>inefficient.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s better to basically just moderate your speed.</p>
<p>Let the headwinds basically pass, we&rsquo;re going to have major</p>
<p>economic headwinds for the next four to six quarters call it</p>
<p>year and a half.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have a slower growth rate preserve your cash.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t burn up your fuel bunker down.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re trying to do is get down the hatches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to give permission to our founders to grow at a</p>
<p>slower rate because they feel this enormous pressure from</p>
<p>their VCs to grow at insane rates.</p>
<p>Can I build on this?</p>
<p>I think Freebrook said it very well.</p>
<p>The scam in venture capital is demonstrated in the following</p>
<p>chart. This is using Cambridge and our friend Brad Gerstner</p>
<p>helped put this together.</p>
<p>So what is this?</p>
<p>This goes back all the way to 1997 and the gray bar is what</p>
<p>venture capitalists share with their limited partners as to</p>
<p>how well they are doing.</p>
<p>What is the top quartile of venture capital?</p>
<p>And this is the top 25%.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is this is a venture capitalist and you know, our</p>
<p>returns have been consistently top quartile.</p>
<p>So instead of cherry picking anybody else, I&rsquo;ll just use us</p>
<p>but it could be Sequoia, Benchmark, you name it.</p>
<p>We would go back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in their launch.</p>
<p>You would go back to folks craft.</p>
<p>We go back to folks and say, hey guys, the total value of our</p>
<p>portfolio is three times your money in 1997 vintage.</p>
<p>Okay, it was four times your money in the 2010 vintage feels</p>
<p>really good.</p>
<p>But again, the job of the venture capitalist is to convert</p>
<p>the gray bar into the purple bar and historically there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a decay.</p>
<p>So for every dollar of gray bar that you show you typically</p>
<p>only get 73 cents actually returned to people.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The paper value, the book value versus the valuations that you</p>
<p>get when you sell your company or goes public end up being 73%</p>
<p>of what you marked at the peak what you said they were exactly</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>And the actual value of this purple bar going back, you know,</p>
<p>30 years is 1.7 X.</p>
<p>So just to put numerical numbers on this if you were a venture</p>
<p>capitalist, you would raise a hundred dollar fund at the peak</p>
<p>you would actually show that that hundred dollars became 200</p>
<p>and about $28, but when when push came to shove and when it</p>
<p>was all said and done you would return $170 back to your</p>
<p>investors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rough equation.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Well, the problem as you can see in this charge is right around</p>
<p>2015 which is all of a sudden, you know, what we&rsquo;ve started</p>
<p>to see are these continually elevated gray bars.</p>
<p>Yes, this stuff is worth seven times six times five times, but</p>
<p>we have not seen the purple bars catch up.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Some people will say well, yeah, but you have to give it time</p>
<p>and you know, this is it has to make other reason to look at</p>
<p>and all you need to do is do what&rsquo;s called a regression and</p>
<p>you need to regress these things to the mean and make the</p>
<p>following assumption.</p>
<p>Assume for a second that this time is not different.</p>
<p>Assume that these historical averages 2.2 X 1.7 X holds.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what the the black line here shows.</p>
<p>You can calculate the area above the curve as the value at</p>
<p>risk, right?</p>
<p>The amount of money we will destroy because of all these</p>
<p>shenanigans at free bird just talked about propping up marks</p>
<p>not willing to look at actual market clearing prices.</p>
<p>Well, if you do the math the sum of the area above this black</p>
<p>line is almost a trillion dollars around the world and it</p>
<p>is about 600 billion dollars for US venture capitalists.</p>
<p>This is the dynamic that the private equity industry is going</p>
<p>to prey on.</p>
<p>So if you saw Toma Bravo just close to 32 billion dollar round,</p>
<p>you know, Vista is raising a 20 billion dollar round.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s stepping into tech.</p>
<p>They are going to destroy those gray bars.</p>
<p>You describe that as bottom feeding.</p>
<p>No, no, they are.</p>
<p>They are the rational actor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, who is finding the true market cleaner price again?</p>
<p>I will say this.</p>
<p>I think the private equity industry is unbelievably precise</p>
<p>and talented in being dispassionate and telling us what</p>
<p>these things are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cutthroat.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re logic.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just smart for the private equity industry is going</p>
<p>to be created by profligate founders and look, you could</p>
<p>blame VCs for the high marks last year as well.</p>
<p>They were profligate too.</p>
<p>But look, if you&rsquo;re a founder, if you don&rsquo;t start acting</p>
<p>in a more capital efficient way and preserve your cash, your</p>
<p>company is ultimately going to be owned by a private equity</p>
<p>firm and they&rsquo;re going to make all the money.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s an important, because when you sell to them</p>
<p>at a low price, all you&rsquo;re going to end up doing is paying</p>
<p>back the liquidation preference and then that private equity</p>
<p>firm that was willing to do or less, but that private equity</p>
<p>firm will be willing to do what you were not willing to do,</p>
<p>which was simply act, but cut your burn, cut your costs and</p>
<p>act in a more capital efficient way.</p>
<p>And they will end up making all the upside for your decade</p>
<p>of hard work because you got a basically addicted to venture</p>
<p>capital and the high valuations and refuse to again, adjust</p>
<p>to the regime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an alternative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an alternative.</p>
<p>The alternative is that the majority of acquisitions made</p>
<p>by private equity firms are not actually pure acquisitions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bolt on acquisitions, meaning that these are companies</p>
<p>that are added to existing platforms that they own.</p>
<p>So this acquisition they&rsquo;re doing of Coupa, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very likely over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>You will see like the playbook and private equity includes</p>
<p>not just cost cutting, but also synergy building and they</p>
<p>typically do bolt ons and add ons.</p>
<p>And this happens across all private equity platform deals</p>
<p>of new products and services that can be sold through the</p>
<p>existing sales channel, the existing customer base.</p>
<p>And as an add on to the existing service or product that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already offered.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I think you may see in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley over the next couple of years is a rationalization</p>
<p>away from funding feature companies and thinking much more</p>
<p>carefully about what can be true standalone product companies.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And many of these companies that have raised a ton of capital</p>
<p>and have gotten crazy valuations at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more likely better equipped to be a feature of another platform</p>
<p>than they are to be a standalone platform company of their</p>
<p>own. And that&rsquo;s where the majority of these acquisitions will</p>
<p>likely end up going.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the private equity landscape, and they will be</p>
<p>vacuumed up and attached to existing platforms that these</p>
<p>private equity guys are building out.</p>
<p>And by the way, just look as an example at what Oracle did over</p>
<p>the years, what Salesforce did over the years, what Google did</p>
<p>so many of these companies bolt on acquisitions by bolt on</p>
<p>acquisitions by building a channel building a platform and</p>
<p>then adding on top of that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a lot of these guys are going to try and</p>
<p>mimic two critical points.</p>
<p>Number one.</p>
<p>What about the bottom 75% of VCs?</p>
<p>If you show that chart just for one more second, I just want</p>
<p>to remind everybody that is the absolute cream of the crop</p>
<p>VCs top 25% of the best.</p>
<p>These are folks.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I&rsquo;ll just say us Sequoia benchmark.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve consistently been a quartile.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Launchcraft.</p>
<p>These are these are top chefs return stream.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord.</p>
<p>What about the bottom 75%?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to be able to raise funds, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over a lot of these people who raise first time funds in</p>
<p>the last three or four years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the companies.</p>
<p>Because like like it&rsquo;s like the today is the most now is the</p>
<p>moment for the sober founder and the sober venture capitalist</p>
<p>to sit and say what is the real valuation?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>What do we need to do to make sure that this company has a</p>
<p>chance because what sack said is so true.</p>
<p>Otherwise all these profit dollars will be made by the</p>
<p>private equity freeze in order to win today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to grind you&rsquo;re going to have to work</p>
<p>5060 hours a week.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to be absolutely embrace the age of</p>
<p>austerity and you&rsquo;re going to have to focus on your customer</p>
<p>your product and your bottom line the age of excess is over</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not working 5060 70 hours a week.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to cut it in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Also key second point profligate extravagant or wasteful in</p>
<p>the use of resources just so we get the word of the day from</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s David Sachs is word of the day after us a very powerful</p>
<p>bull.</p>
<p>This is this is that went crazy.</p>
<p>Did you see the tremendous bull wave?</p>
<p>Went we&rsquo;ve all went we went viral.</p>
<p>This is I think Elon&rsquo;s biggest non-obvious impact in this</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>JTOWER here&rsquo;s your one answer to your question about what</p>
<p>happens to the the bottom 75% of venture firms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equivalent to what happens with the you know, kind of this</p>
<p>is the bottom of the top the slide that I just shared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one we looked at a few weeks ago and I keep referring</p>
<p>to it because it&rsquo;s just such a staggering like demonstration</p>
<p>of what people call the power law, which is how you know, kind</p>
<p>of excess returns accumulate to minority of investments.</p>
<p>So just a few investments make up the bulk of value that the</p>
<p>you know market cap of 43% of companies that have gone public</p>
<p>since 2020 is 750 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The market cap of 300 the other 300 is only 26 billion dollars</p>
<p>and the cash that went in to the 750 billion dollars is 136 and</p>
<p>the cash that went into the 26 is 107.</p>
<p>And so the cash that went in to generate that 26 billion at</p>
<p>107 that&rsquo;s your bottom 50% and the top 50% put in 136 to make</p>
<p>750 and I think it gets even narrower as you move further up</p>
<p>to that top quartile.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s just I can tell you what LPs are saying</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s a hard business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this is the companies that went public.</p>
<p>So this is also of the top company of the top funds and the</p>
<p>top companies that were actually able to IPO and so it highlights</p>
<p>how much of a power law actually plays through and so the</p>
<p>majority of these companies as you in Chamath even in your</p>
<p>chart you show the top quartile the bottom 75% or the bottom</p>
<p>50% I&rsquo;ve looked at this data as well of those various vintages</p>
<p>are below 1.0.</p>
<p>They lose money for their LPs.</p>
<p>Oh consistently and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a cycle.</p>
<p>And so what ends up happening is the next generation comes</p>
<p>through and LPs they make a portfolio of bets and they hope</p>
<p>that they make enough bets in the right VCs that their</p>
<p>portfolio generates greater than you know market returns greater</p>
<p>than call it 15 20% target 15% target, but they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>expect the majority or not.</p>
<p>I have an LP of report.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out there raising launch fund for right now and I moved</p>
<p>from like the accredited the individual investor say that.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, because you&rsquo;re not 560.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m publicly raising it and I&rsquo;ve moved on from individual</p>
<p>investors 45 million dollars in commits after five webinars</p>
<p>amazing.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m talking to you know, it was amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just 5060 is going to change the entire industry letting</p>
<p>the you know, the masses have some access to this capital and</p>
<p>this opportunity accredited and QB is going to change the world.</p>
<p>I believe you have to do deal with everyone one of them is it</p>
<p>easy to administer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly complex because you have a large number of</p>
<p>people and they all want to talk to me.</p>
<p>So I did webinars five webinars and it resulted in a hundred</p>
<p>commits hundreds of commits for 45 million dollars, but you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to pull you&rsquo;ll be able to get all those capital commitments</p>
<p>drawn down when you need to like you have to go ping a couple</p>
<p>hundred people and get them all the wire money.</p>
<p>Do you need to have more operations people and we only do</p>
<p>for we let them one thing one thing you may want to do is like</p>
<p>for these smaller slugs is you can prewire you can set up an</p>
<p>escrow can&rsquo;t where you prewire a hundred percent of the capital.</p>
<p>Yes, and then you also don&rsquo;t have to you take it down when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to deploy it.</p>
<p>So you keep your IRR correct.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually looking into those solutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you offline, but I just did my first two meetings</p>
<p>with endowments etc fund to funds the entire discussions</p>
<p>right now are around.</p>
<p>What is your secondary strategy?</p>
<p>How are you getting in earlier not later?</p>
<p>And how are you building a larger position?</p>
<p>It is and even like some of the QP&rsquo;s were sophisticated in our</p>
<p>you know are in over 10 venture funds the entire discussion</p>
<p>governance of these companies.</p>
<p>Are you taking board seats or not?</p>
<p>How early are you getting in and building a larger position</p>
<p>over 10% and what is your secondary strategy?</p>
<p>When are you going to start taking some chips off the table?</p>
<p>So the and I got to say if you&rsquo;re an LP who didn&rsquo;t sell into</p>
<p>the upmarket at all and you&rsquo;re on your first fund, you know,</p>
<p>and you had all these great marks and they&rsquo;re getting the</p>
<p>coming crashing down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to deal with you.</p>
<p>They just have too many options of top funds in the court.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve started to come down yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we know what the top quartiles really going to</p>
<p>look like over these last few years.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to take four or five years to really</p>
<p>sort out.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think explain why Chamath just so people understand</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>Well, I think I think that there are lots of valuations that</p>
<p>have supported huge TV PIs these, you know paper gains that</p>
<p>have allowed venture funds to raise enormous amounts of incremental</p>
<p>capital and new funds.</p>
<p>And so they are going to try to wait as long as possible before</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re held accountable for that and the best way to do that</p>
<p>is to not change the valuation and so it will happen slowly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a trickle of these things and I think that takes</p>
<p>probably four or five years for it to really sort itself out.</p>
<p>But in the meantime companies will still need to get financed</p>
<p>companies will still need to get built.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think like the public markets.</p>
<p>I think what SAC says is true giving us a signal of what these</p>
<p>true market clearing prices are will eventually slip into these,</p>
<p>you know, series D or E companies because a venture capitalist</p>
<p>who has now taken some big write-downs in one part of their</p>
<p>portfolio.</p>
<p>I suspect will now be very open to selling to private equity for</p>
<p>another part of their portfolio so that they can return capital</p>
<p>totally totally agree.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be rough out there.</p>
<p>You guys watch White Lotus.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just started season one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m third episode in.</p>
<p>Okay, what a treat.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t say anything but how great was season two?</p>
<p>The wrap was awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>The last two episodes were extraordinary.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s not say anything.</p>
<p>Matt and I just finished watching all of Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale which</p>
<p>I will tell you is that is a fucking stressful show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re putting in work when you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>those episodes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh emotional labor, you know when they said this</p>
<p>emotional labor watching that show is like, oh my god.</p>
<p>It could could it could not be more sadistic and insane.</p>
<p>Oh my god, it is brutal, but you can&rsquo;t look away incredibly</p>
<p>well done.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Listen, this has been an amazing episode and this is news for</p>
<p>the other besties.</p>
<p>Friedberg and I have been secretly collaborating.</p>
<p>No, we have you have a plan to a plan that we&rsquo;re working on a</p>
<p>joint plan for all in summit 2023 because we are both helping</p>
<p>each other out on secret projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to tip guys.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>The tip.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s we don&rsquo;t need you sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a permanent.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We know that you&rsquo;re locked in.</p>
<p>No, I love that.</p>
<p>I have sacks as my anchor on this one.</p>
<p>I can always float back that way.</p>
<p>This thing could flip but Friedberg and I I&rsquo;m like in this</p>
<p>case money is the root of all evil totally in this case, but</p>
<p>power and influence is something that even that&rsquo;s Friedberg</p>
<p>celebrity Friedberg had so much of a good time at all.</p>
<p>In summit 2022 that his hatred of my producer fee is less than</p>
<p>his joy from the event and we are collaborating on super super</p>
<p>gut.</p>
<p>I have made up for my producer&rsquo;s fee by using super gut and</p>
<p>becoming a big proponent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve announced it to make use the promo code.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s he paid you for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the quipro quote.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, this is no conflict.</p>
<p>No interest to go along with doing the no conflict.</p>
<p>No interest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Got bars and amazing.</p>
<p>So I use the double mocha.</p>
<p>The only the only person that you haven&rsquo;t taken money from is</p>
<p>SPF.</p>
<p>I mean pretty much you&rsquo;re by the way.</p>
<p>Can I point out on the most loathsome person in tech bracket?</p>
<p>Can we go through it?</p>
<p>Do not name the company.</p>
<p>Do not name the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eliminated already in the first round.</p>
<p>This is bullshit.</p>
<p>And you know, I thought you win.</p>
<p>No, I thought you won.</p>
<p>No, he lost.</p>
<p>It was possible.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s pull up the bracket.</p>
<p>Do not mention the podcast.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>How did Andy Jassy get on your chest?</p>
<p>Not I only want the bracket.</p>
<p>Do not mention the podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not giving them any just black out that in post.</p>
<p>I want you to black out.</p>
<p>Take it easy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give these guys any credit.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>The worst person in tech.</p>
<p>This is Chamath and Sachs.</p>
<p>We would say it&rsquo;s a B podcast that&rsquo;s run by literal socialists.</p>
<p>Well, look Chamath got a very tough draw.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, you&rsquo;re going to lose to SBF.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, you know, you went up against the Warriors with</p>
<p>KD.</p>
<p>It is no way to win.</p>
<p>Tough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough draw.</p>
<p>You had no shot.</p>
<p>You guys should have been on the side.</p>
<p>What about Sachs?</p>
<p>Easy draw.</p>
<p>Sachs versus in the most hated person in tech.</p>
<p>By 1%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Nobody even knows who Andy Jassy is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Andy Jassy is a complete gentleman.</p>
<p>Andy Jassy is delightful.</p>
<p>Sachs is a horrible human compared to Andy Jassy.</p>
<p>Just in spice.</p>
<p>That is, I want to recount.</p>
<p>No, I wanted to win.</p>
<p>Sachs.</p>
<p>I want to recount.</p>
<p>This is election interference.</p>
<p>Union busting.</p>
<p>This is election interference.</p>
<p>I guess something you&rsquo;re a specialist in.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s worse to be a union busting Amazon CEO than a</p>
<p>reactionary conservative investor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that the biggest travesty here is</p>
<p>that I did not make the list.</p>
<p>There are, and you know what?</p>
<p>These guys are trolling me.</p>
<p>These guys.</p>
<p>Shout out to producer Nick who just retweeted this.</p>
<p>Basically, you basically pick the, what is it?</p>
<p>The 30 most relatively well-known people in tech.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what tilts J Cal the most.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>Worst person in tech.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make the list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to double down this year.</p>
<p>Constantly kowtowing to the media.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I need to be horrible.</p>
<p>I need to be a worse human like you Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try my best this year to work against humanity</p>
<p>and society and be more loathsome than you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really going to redouble my efforts.</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t catch up with you.</p>
<p>You buy into all their phony.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too kind.</p>
<p>I got a big heart.</p>
<p>I care.</p>
<p>I have empathy into all their phony.</p>
<p>I know my empathy, but here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>These guys left me off on purpose.</p>
<p>If you want to pull up the replies between Andreessen and</p>
<p>Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Oh, Andreessen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Andreessen.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Andreessen crushed him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a 16 co-founder and man of terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, Marc Andreessen is a world-class shit poster.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is hiding somewhere.</p>
<p>Nobody Bill Gates is doesn&rsquo;t tweet Marc Andreessen blocks</p>
<p>unblocks.</p>
<p>He shit posts with the best of them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s up there.</p>
<p>I mean that guy&rsquo;s a dark meme Lord.</p>
<p>Any other I mean, I really I really sympathize with you</p>
<p>Chamath that you got your ass handed to you there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s like going up against the dream team.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Slow down, bro.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even letting us read these things.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Give me okay.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at this one Twitter former idiot CEO versus</p>
<p>Airbnb CEO making.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so well-written Brian.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Slow down Brian this weekend.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great guy guy who really tried to make us believe</p>
<p>web3 was going to happen versus world coin and open.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Chris Dixon wins much more loathsome than Sam Altman.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I got to run.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This has been free bird.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even come I want to just congratulate free bird</p>
<p>on an amazing the best science corner ever an amazing product</p>
<p>and super gut that has helped me lose weight.</p>
<p>I feel great and for you know, recovering from whatever</p>
<p>illness you had.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>I love you besties.</p>
<p>Shout out to David Sachs.</p>
<p>Love you guys, and we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the all</p>
<p>in podcast.</p>
<p>Love you besties.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge</p>
<p>orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to</p>
<p>release them out.</p>
