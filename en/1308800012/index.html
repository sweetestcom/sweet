    <p>In any good investigation, you&rsquo;re running down multiple leads at once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a time efficiency thing, it&rsquo;s what helps you avoid getting tunnel vision.</p>
<p>So one of the times we met with Nelson, it wasn&rsquo;t just Kenneth McCune Jr.&rsquo;s name that</p>
<p>we brought up.</p>
<p>We also asked him about another name.</p>
<p>We said, hey, what do you know about John Paul Clark?</p>
<p>Did your office ever seriously look at him?</p>
<p>So John Paul Clark is the first time this name&rsquo;s been brought up?</p>
<p>I mean, where did you get that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that as a no.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just guessing.</p>
<p>It was actually one of the very few things the original investigator David Yocolet would</p>
<p>talk to us about.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d never heard the name John Paul Clark.</p>
<p>But what we had to say about him was interesting enough to make David scribble down his name</p>
<p>on a pad of paper that he brought with him.</p>
<p>John Clark&rsquo;s name was there, in Darlene&rsquo;s file, all the way back in August of 1984.</p>
<p>This is Episode 11, Bad Seed.</p>
<p>5 days after Darlene was taken from her home, an anonymous letter was written to the sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office.</p>
<p>Dear Sheriff,</p>
<p>John P. Clark of Park County, Indiana, allegedly assaulted and stabbed a woman at Rockville.</p>
<p>He since has escaped from the Park County Jail, last seen near Ladoga.</p>
<p>The Hulse murder sounds like the Rockville incident where John posed as needing to use</p>
<p>the phone.</p>
<p>The dark streaked hair could be dyed as John has dark hair.</p>
<p>I have met John twice.</p>
<p>A check with Park County could get you a picture and fingerprints.</p>
<p>Yours truly, Just Afraid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell what work investigators did back in 84 after they got this tip about</p>
<p>a violent fugitive on the run from Rockville, Indiana.</p>
<p>They would have received this letter when they were hot on Danny Bender&rsquo;s trail, so</p>
<p>maybe it got overlooked.</p>
<p>But it piqued our interest enough to at least Google the guy.</p>
<p>If he escaped in Rockville before Darlene&rsquo;s murder and was spotted near Ladoga, it meant</p>
<p>he was heading northeast out of Rockville.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a straight shot northeast from Rockville to Argus, but Ladoga is on the way.</p>
<p>Ish.</p>
<p>If you take your time and aren&rsquo;t bothered by taking the scenic route.</p>
<p>So who is this guy?</p>
<p>What came of him?</p>
<p>Where is he now?</p>
<p>John Paul Clark.</p>
<p>The top search result about John Paul Clark was a newspaper article written about him</p>
<p>from 2007.</p>
<p>The Herald-Bulletin headline reads,</p>
<p>Redeemed.</p>
<p>Man explores his life in prison and beyond.</p>
<p>The article does a poor job of explaining the crime that got John sent to prison.</p>
<p>It mostly talks about how he found God while behind bars and how he&rsquo;s lived a life dedicated</p>
<p>to youth ministry ever since he was freed.</p>
<p>But when we read the article, some things weren&rsquo;t adding up.</p>
<p>The Herald-Bulletin reported that prior to the time John stabbed a woman at her house</p>
<p>in either 1983 or 1984, he hadn&rsquo;t committed any other violent crimes.</p>
<p>But we had already found some old newspaper archives online that said otherwise.</p>
<p>The article also didn&rsquo;t mention anything about him escaping from jail, or his motive,</p>
<p>or his victim, or really anything about the crime or the charges he faced.</p>
<p>Essentially, it was a puff piece that totally ignored his victims, which we weren&rsquo;t into.</p>
<p>So Emily got a case number from the Indiana Department of Corrections and headed to Rockville,</p>
<p>which is like two and a half hours south of Argus.</p>
<p>Since John had been convicted, we knew there would be some court documents that might clear</p>
<p>up what exactly he did and where exactly he was in August 1984.</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s first stop was the Park County Courthouse.</p>
<p>This is what I have.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking for this calls number, which is what you gave me.</p>
<p>And then John Paul Clark.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Attempted murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go take this upstairs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>And what was it you were looking for?</p>
<p>Pretty much anything I can find.</p>
<p>Just let her look through it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of pages to thumb through, but we were basically searching for context</p>
<p>about John&rsquo;s stabbing arrest, his subsequent escape, and any information about his whereabouts</p>
<p>when he was on the run.</p>
<p>We figured if John had any ties to Argus or Marshall County, they might be mentioned in</p>
<p>records from his previous crimes.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what we figured out.</p>
<p>John Paul Clark was arrested for attempted murder and attempted rape in April 1984 after</p>
<p>he went to a woman&rsquo;s house in Rockville and stabbed her multiple times, almost killing</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>He was arrested for that crime the same night it happened and got booked into the Park County</p>
<p>Jail in Rockville.</p>
<p>He stayed behind bars awaiting trial for the next five months or so until August 5th, 1984</p>
<p>when John escaped.</p>
<p>According to police reports, John saw a door wide open in the jail and just left.</p>
<p>Then he walked to his parents&rsquo; house nearby, went inside, stole some loose change, and</p>
<p>then took their car, a 1974 green Dodge Colt station wagon.</p>
<p>And that was the first kind of, oh shit, moment that we had.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking in coincidences, a man accused of attempted murder being on the run</p>
<p>in a green car 12 days before Darlene was killed, that&rsquo;s an interesting coincidence.</p>
<p>But one small thing stuck out.</p>
<p>None of the car descriptions in the Hulse case say the suspect&rsquo;s car was a station</p>
<p>wagon, just that it was a rusty 1970s old greenish car with a quote-unquote big trunk.</p>
<p>So could a station wagon look like a big trunk?</p>
<p>Some of the descriptions we&rsquo;d come across had been muddy before, so we figured we should</p>
<p>just keep digging.</p>
<p>And to be honest, if John had escaped and fled in a red car, we might have stopped right</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>But there was something else that made us keep digging.</p>
<p>Because of an eyewitness account, police believed that 21-year-old John took his parents'</p>
<p>car and drove north from Rockville.</p>
<p>And in the documents Emily got, police wrote that they had reason to believe he had connections</p>
<p>quote-unquote up north because of a prior stint in juvie for a different crime that</p>
<p>John committed in 1981.</p>
<p>The sheriff at the time was quoted in the Park County Sentinel saying John probably</p>
<p>knew how to go into hiding thanks to his quote-unquote connections and that he was very street smart.</p>
<p>The sheriff also told area newspapers back then that he had reason to believe that John</p>
<p>might be meeting up with an old buddy and swapping his parents&rsquo; car for a motorcycle.</p>
<p>The documents stated that John was on the run and missing from August 5th to August</p>
<p>27th, 1984.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when a tip led to him being apprehended on a motorcycle in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>So that confirmed that he was in fact out of jail and still on the run when Darlene</p>
<p>was killed on August 17.</p>
<p>But the old reports didn&rsquo;t say anything about how long John hung around Indiana before heading</p>
<p>out to Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Now because John was a juvenile for the first crime he committed, we weren&rsquo;t able to obtain</p>
<p>those records.</p>
<p>So we couldn&rsquo;t see if it was a similar crime or what slash who in that case could give</p>
<p>him ties to northern Indiana.</p>
<p>But Emily was able to look up the old investigators on both of the cases to see if they remembered</p>
<p>John ever being in Marshall County or near Argus while he was on the lam, or if they</p>
<p>knew who he&rsquo;d gotten the motorcycle from.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t get anywhere there because the former sheriff and ISP detective</p>
<p>who worked the case are both deceased.</p>
<p>So if we couldn&rsquo;t talk to the people who investigated John, then there are two other</p>
<p>people we felt could give us the information we were looking for.</p>
<p>John himself and the woman he attacked.</p>
<p>Using the court documents we&rsquo;d obtained, we looked that woman up on Facebook and sent</p>
<p>her a DM.</p>
<p>While we waited, we also called and emailed John Paul Clark.</p>
<p>We were hopeful at first that this redeemed man of God would be willing to talk with us.</p>
<p>You know, since he opened up to a reporter before.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t quite that easy.</p>
<p>His landline was disconnected and we didn&rsquo;t get a reply via email.</p>
<p>But we did get a call back from the woman he nearly killed in 1984, Sherry Dodson Lasser.</p>
<p>And she was eager to talk.</p>
<p>It said in the paper that he had stabbed me one time, which was a lie.</p>
<p>He stabbed me 18 times.</p>
<p>In spring of 1984, Sherry was in her early 30s and newly divorced with two sons.</p>
<p>On the night of April 28th, Sherry had been at a girlfriend&rsquo;s house and got home at around</p>
<p>10.30 or 11.</p>
<p>She poured herself a glass of wine and fell asleep in her recliner in the living room.</p>
<p>I got home probably around 10.30, 11, something like that.</p>
<p>And I poured myself a glass of wine and I sat down on my recliner and just sat there</p>
<p>crying and thinking, you know, about my mom.</p>
<p>And I fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was raining and storming out really bad that night.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, I woke up to this pounding on my sliding glass door.</p>
<p>And I looked out the door.</p>
<p>I pulled my curtains back and I looked out the door.</p>
<p>And there was this kid there and he said, you know, can I use your phone?</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m sorry, you know.</p>
<p>And he said, well, he said, and he says, please, it&rsquo;s raining outside.</p>
<p>My car broke down and I just need to call my uncle.</p>
<p>So I let him in to use my phone.</p>
<p>So he tried using the phone and it would, he said it was busy.</p>
<p>So we sat down at my dining room table and we had, we had a cigarette and he tried it</p>
<p>again and he said, oh, it&rsquo;s still busy.</p>
<p>And I said, well, what&rsquo;s the number?</p>
<p>Let me try it for you.</p>
<p>And so when I did, it said, this number is out of service.</p>
<p>I said, this number is out of service.</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s the storm.</p>
<p>And I said, let me get you a garbage bag to put over your head.</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s not that far.</p>
<p>And so I got him the garbage bag and I gave it to him and I was walking to the door to</p>
<p>open it up for him and he grabbed me and he turned me around.</p>
<p>He says, you make a move or a sound and I will kill both your kids.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, please, I said, my kids are sleeping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do anything you want, right?</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>The first thing I said, though, was, oh, please, because the first thing he said to me was</p>
<p>you make a move or a sound and I&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, please, my mom&rsquo;s dying.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take this.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>And he said, you either listen to me or I&rsquo;m going to kill both your boys.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>And so I looked him in the eyes and there were just red, all kinds of, he looked like</p>
<p>a monster.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t look like the person that&rsquo;s walking out there right now.</p>
<p>And so I just thought, you know what, he&rsquo;s a kid, I&rsquo;ll faint and he&rsquo;ll run, right?</p>
<p>So I acted like I fainted.</p>
<p>And when I did that, he started cutting my clothes off.</p>
<p>So I thought, you know what, I&rsquo;m going to get raped.</p>
<p>Maybe once that happens, he&rsquo;ll run.</p>
<p>So when I did that, he started cutting my breasts.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t lay there when you&rsquo;re getting cut.</p>
<p>So I came up with my knee and I caught him in the crotch and I shoved him and I jumped</p>
<p>up and I almost got out the door.</p>
<p>And he grabbed me and I grabbed, I can remember I grabbed the curtains and as he pulled me</p>
<p>back, I pulled the curtains down.</p>
<p>And he said, you try that again and your boys are dead.</p>
<p>And I said, oh please, let&rsquo;s go somewhere.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my boys to see this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go somewhere else.</p>
<p>I promise you, I won&rsquo;t do anything if you&rsquo;ll just let, let, let&rsquo;s just go somewhere.</p>
<p>So he said, okay, and I was shocked.</p>
<p>So we get out by my car and we&rsquo;re on the back of my car and I don&rsquo;t remember how blood</p>
<p>got on my car.</p>
<p>I can remember there was spots of blood on my car and I took off running.</p>
<p>I broke loose and took off running.</p>
<p>Well, the neighbor&rsquo;s yard, it was raining so bad and muddy and the neighbor&rsquo;s yard goes</p>
<p>up a hill and I slipped and fell.</p>
<p>And when I did, he just started stabbing me and I rolled up in a ball like this and my</p>
<p>little dog got out of the house and was biting him.</p>
<p>And between the dog barking and I had actually, I saw the light, I saw I was gone and it was</p>
<p>beautiful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to come back.</p>
<p>And I heard my neighbor yelling, what&rsquo;s going on out there?</p>
<p>And they said that my knees shot out and I shoved him all the way off me.</p>
<p>And he took off running.</p>
<p>I remember there was an ambulance and I could just remember shaking like, so I was cold,</p>
<p>but I guess I was in shock.</p>
<p>And I said, just get me to the hospital.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re, as we&rsquo;re going to the hospital and we&rsquo;re, 36 has these winding roads and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re discussing like, uh, should we take her to Terre Haute?</p>
<p>The other one said, do you think she&rsquo;ll make it that far?</p>
<p>She did make it.</p>
<p>And John Paul Clark was apprehended before the sun even came up.</p>
<p>A police officer testified that he went to John&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house right after Sherry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attack and found him in his childhood bedroom, still covered in Sherry&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>He was arrested that night and was locked away until he escaped the Park County jail</p>
<p>a few months later.</p>
<p>Sherry moved to a different town when she was released from the hospital.</p>
<p>And when police called her a few months later to tell her John escaped, she was so shocked</p>
<p>that she actually passed out.</p>
<p>She thought he was coming to finish her off.</p>
<p>And she lived in absolute fear for her safety and the safety of her kids until he was arrested</p>
<p>three weeks later in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>John was clearly a violent man.</p>
<p>And just like in Darlene&rsquo;s case, it seemed like he used a ruse to get into Sherry&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>But there weren&rsquo;t many other standout connections between the crime he committed against Sherry</p>
<p>and what had been done to Darlene.</p>
<p>But then Sherry told us something that made our heads spin.</p>
<p>Sherry eventually learned more about John Paul Clark.</p>
<p>An Indiana state trooper said that he had been stalking her home since he got out on</p>
<p>probation for his prior crime.</p>
<p>Now on probation for what is the natural question?</p>
<p>Now like I said, those 1981 juvie records are sealed.</p>
<p>The only info we can see is that he was charged with attempted rape but took a plea deal for</p>
<p>battery and was sentenced on a C felony for battery.</p>
<p>But the memory of that sealed record was still fresh in the trooper&rsquo;s mind when he talked</p>
<p>to Sherry.</p>
<p>He said that in 1981, John was arrested for beating and sexually assaulting a 17-year-old</p>
<p>girl with a fireplace poker.</p>
<p>You understand why our jaws dropped, right?</p>
<p>This was the first we had ever heard of John using the same type of weapon Darlene was</p>
<p>killed with.</p>
<p>But the problem was we needed proof.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t responsibly report this if all we had was the word of a trooper who told</p>
<p>Sherry some 38 years ago.</p>
<p>So we went back through everything we had to see if we could verify it.</p>
<p>And sure enough, we found it.</p>
<p>The very day Darlene&rsquo;s body was found, August 18, 1984, police in Marshall County got this</p>
<p>fax from former Park County Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy Jack Shannon.</p>
<p>Apparently other law enforcement officers who were familiar with John Paul Clark were</p>
<p>making the connection once they heard that Darlene had been killed with the same weapon</p>
<p>their newly escaped inmate was known to use.</p>
<p>But even with this fax and the anonymous letter signed from Just Afraid, I&rsquo;m not sure law</p>
<p>enforcement in Argus were seeing the same thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if these just slipped through the cracks or if they were ignored, but we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find any documentation that John Clark was looked into at any point.</p>
<p>Even today, when we asked Prosecutor Chipman and retired Sergeant David Yokelet if they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ever looked into him, they didn&rsquo;t even know his name.</p>
<p>There was one more tip in the Hulse case that we found regarding John Clark, and it was</p>
<p>from the ISP trooper who had worked his case, a guy named Dan Clevenger.</p>
<p>He called police in Marshall County on August 20th, 1984, to advise them, quote,</p>
<p>subject escaped from Park County Jail two weeks ago, was there for attempted rape, stabbed</p>
<p>victim 18 times, end quote.</p>
<p>The end of the handwritten tip said Clevenger would check to see if John has any connections</p>
<p>to Argus.</p>
<p>So either he checked and there wasn&rsquo;t any documentation of his findings or there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>anything worth following up about.</p>
<p>Sherry doesn&rsquo;t know where John went or what he did while he was a fugitive for those three</p>
<p>weeks.</p>
<p>So we tried calling the former prosecutor and John&rsquo;s attorney from back in the 80s,</p>
<p>who are surprisingly both still practicing law today.</p>
<p>His former defense attorney, Jim Bruner, remembered representing John and remembered him escaping</p>
<p>jail.</p>
<p>And he represented him when he was extradited back to Indiana.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t remember him saying where he went during those two or three weeks?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>I have no recollection of that at all.</p>
<p>Former Park County prosecutor Jim Hanner is the one that sent John to prison, and he feels</p>
<p>he deserved hard time.</p>
<p>Wherever John was, it seems only John knows.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t anything we&rsquo;ve been able to find yet that places him in Argus, but we did find</p>
<p>a possible connection, albeit a very loose connection to the town.</p>
<p>John served time in the same juvenile facility as a man named Bill Swihart, whose grandma</p>
<p>was a longtime Argus local.</p>
<p>When we dug even deeper, we actually found a few leads in the Hulse case involving Bill</p>
<p>and his grandma.</p>
<p>Someone must have known Bill had a violent history.</p>
<p>The tip says Bill, quote, did time at youth center for cutting someone up, end quote.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>The tip also says Bill&rsquo;s grandma had an old green car.</p>
<p>Emily called Bill and left him a few voicemails along with one of his relatives, but we never</p>
<p>heard back.</p>
<p>We even tried getting the Indiana DOC to tell us if John and Bill had been cellmates in</p>
<p>Plainfield, but no luck.</p>
<p>So, so far, that is the only potential tie we could find that John might have had to</p>
<p>Marshall County.</p>
<p>Something I keep coming back to, though, is the car.</p>
<p>Even today, Marie is certain that the suspect&rsquo;s car was not a station wagon.</p>
<p>Could John have met up with his old buddy Bill at his grandma&rsquo;s in Argus and taken her</p>
<p>green car and then swapped it out for a motorcycle that he was found with in Oklahoma?</p>
<p>We have to preface this with a lot of what ifs and maybes and could have been possibles</p>
<p>to get A and B to connect.</p>
<p>But then, just when it feels like a stretch, we find things like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an anonymous letter written to Marshall County police on October 11th, 1984.</p>
<p>Dear sir, this probably isn&rsquo;t anything, but I thought I would mention if in some way it</p>
<p>might bring a clue to your murder case.</p>
<p>On Saturday, about 9 o&rsquo;clock, don&rsquo;t know the date, but it would have been Saturday</p>
<p>morning after you brought the guys back from Colorado.</p>
<p>A station wagon passed me at a great speed.</p>
<p>There was a woman driving, and two men in the front seat.</p>
<p>I noticed their license plates was out-of-state plates.</p>
<p>I could not see the state, but the plates were a dark color.</p>
<p>Dark blue, I think.</p>
<p>It went south and turned onto 19th Road.</p>
<p>What seemed so funny was that it turned into a lane that goes back into a cornfield right</p>
<p>to the east of Clarence Ault&rsquo;s house, and disappeared over the hill.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t bother me too much at the time, because I thought it was someone that Ault&rsquo;s</p>
<p>knew, yet I wondered why they didn&rsquo;t go into the drive to their house.</p>
<p>There about half an hour later, I saw a man on a small motorcycle going north on Fur Road.</p>
<p>The morning was cloudy and no sun.</p>
<p>This man had on a helmet, dark sunglasses, and a jacket.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of this has anything to do with your case or not, but it seemed</p>
<p>a little strange.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be involved, I can&rsquo;t sign my name.</p>
<p>The fact that John Clark swapped a green station wagon for a motorcycle in northern Indiana</p>
<p>before fleeing the state, and the fact that this witness thinks they saw a suspect coming</p>
<p>in a station wagon and leaving on a motorcycle could be a total coincidence.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of those, right?</p>
<p>So we got to the point where the only thing left to do was to ask John where he was on</p>
<p>August 17th, 1984.</p>
<p>After not receiving any response to two emails last fall, Emily tried calling the church</p>
<p>John was affiliated with, but she got no answer there either.</p>
<p>So she grabbed our photographer Jake and set out to see if they could track this guy</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>He still lives in Indiana.</p>
<p>Now nobody was at his church, and the HR department at the university that he used to work for</p>
<p>said that the last time John was on the payroll was over a decade ago, but they did have an</p>
<p>address on file.</p>
<p>So Emily and Jake headed there.</p>
<p>If no one answers, I&rsquo;m going to slip my card and my note in the mailbox.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you John?</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Emily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a journalist.</p>
<p>Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just on a-</p>
<p>You need to read the police reports.</p>
<p>Look, I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do with anything else.</p>
<p>You need to leave people alone.</p>
<p>I just want to know.</p>
<p>I want to cross you off the list.</p>
<p>I have a long list.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of many people.</p>
<p>Read the police reports.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll tell you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>I have all of that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I just want to know where you were between those dates.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know anything.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Do you remember where you went after Park County?</p>
<p>If you bother me, I&rsquo;m going to call the police on you.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t cease and desist, you&rsquo;ll get a letter from an attorney.</p>
<p>So leave me alone.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I got nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why you got my name, why you came to my house, my address.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like stalking me.</p>
<p>I want to know how you got my information, how you found out everything where I live at,</p>
<p>how you got my email address.</p>
<p>The internet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stalking me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Your name is in the police reports, and you&rsquo;re one of many people that I&rsquo;m reaching out to.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s no way I didn&rsquo;t even know where you were at or where this thing happened at or anything.</p>
<p>And the police know where I was at.</p>
<p>So you need to leave people alone.</p>
<p>So you were never in Argus?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where that&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>John was angry.</p>
<p>And I understand being mad about a reporter showing up at your door, bringing up your criminal history from the mid-&rsquo;80s.</p>
<p>But two emails and a doorknock being stalking?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d obviously gotten the emails and knew exactly why Emily was there, but he did not want to talk about it.</p>
<p>We were truly hoping he could just recall the route that he traveled after his jailbreak so we could move on.</p>
<p>But then he said something that sort of had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll say this to you so you get this right.</p>
<p>I left on the 5th of August.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Sunday night.</p>
<p>Within three hours, my car was parked in the northern part of Indiana.</p>
<p>You know where it was at?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was in northern Indiana, and it never moved until my dad got it.</p>
<p>So if this car was supposed to be involved in some crime, why in the fuck did they let my parents go pick it up?</p>
<p>Why in the fuck would the cops let anybody do that shit?</p>
<p>Where did he pick it up?</p>
<p>Leave me the fuck alone!</p>
<p>Jake was watching this interaction from the car, per Emily&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>She figured it was better to have a driver at the ready, but Jake said that John&rsquo;s body language was aggressive.</p>
<p>He was close to interjecting when Emily hurried back to the car.</p>
<p>Did you hear him?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s angry.</p>
<p>He looked very angry.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get out of here.</p>
<p>He says his car, he left the car in northern Indiana.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he was yelling at you?</p>
<p>He told me to leave him the fuck alone.</p>
<p>Yeah, I kind of gathered that too.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, better than him slamming the door in my face.</p>
<p>You got something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re the scapegoats in these situations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re out looking for the truth for Darlene and her family,</p>
<p>and when we go looking for answers that police should have tried to track down decades ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the ones that get cussed at.</p>
<p>So that was obviously all we were going to get out of John.</p>
<p>After his release in 2002, John has never been convicted of another violent crime, as far as we know.</p>
<p>John emailed us a few weeks after Emily&rsquo;s visit, threatening to sue.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if John had anything to do with Darlene&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>and police never looked into him, so he&rsquo;s never been named a suspect or even a person of interest.</p>
<p>But based on our very pleasant conversation with the maybe ex-pastor whose life was once labeled redeemed,</p>
<p>we were unable to mark him off our list,</p>
<p>because he couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t say where he was on August 17th, 1984.</p>
<p>If anyone is listening who knows more about where John&rsquo;s car was in northern Indiana</p>
<p>or what he was up to the day Darlene died, we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d also love to talk to the young woman who survived John&rsquo;s 1981 attack,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s something she&rsquo;d be comfortable with.</p>
<p>But until then, there&rsquo;s someone else that we have to consider.</p>
<p>He cannot be ruled out as a suspect.</p>
<p>When you look at means, motive, and method, and opportunity,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy who stands up above everyone else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s next in Episode 12, P.I.&rsquo;s Best Lead.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
