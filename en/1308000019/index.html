    <p>Hey everybody, it&rsquo;s me, Jason Calaclinas. Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, it&rsquo;s me, Jason.</p>
<p>Thank god Trump&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>I hate Trump and I love myself.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, happy days are here again. Champagne bottles popping. Happy days are here again.</p>
<p>Sax is so happy. Trump&rsquo;s out of office.</p>
<p>He gave an amazing speech about how great Biden&rsquo;s inauguration was.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>With me today, in our post-inauguration afterglow, is the dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>the queen of quinoa, David Friedberg, and riding the blue wave, diving in.</p>
<p>No more red pills. The blue wave is David. Rain Man Sax is with us.</p>
<p>David, how did it feel to watch Biden&rsquo;s inauguration speech,</p>
<p>which you said hit all the notes, and I see you wearing blue today.</p>
<p>Let me have a sip of my Vuv-Kliko and tell us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the blue jacket, the blue shirt, and the blue headset on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ridden the blue wave. Tell us how you feel with Biden in office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to drink my Vuv.</p>
<p>Jason, I&rsquo;m just happy to see that you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>Does this mean that your Trump derangement is over?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gone cold turkey. You&rsquo;re on the wagon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just happy to have my friend back and not have you part of this</p>
<p>Trump derangement zombie horde that you&rsquo;ve been in for the last few years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you two quick stories.</p>
<p>The first one turned out not to be true, but there was a New York Times alert</p>
<p>that came out this weekend saying that they were going to lift the travel ban.</p>
<p>For a moment, I was a little in shock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Canadian. My family&rsquo;s in Canada. I haven&rsquo;t seen them in a year.</p>
<p>My mom is 80 years old. I haven&rsquo;t seen her in a year.</p>
<p>Then the second was on the day of the inauguration,</p>
<p>Biden signed an EO, I guess, that starts to basically create a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>There are two women in my life who I think are just lovely, lovely people</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve never been able to hire.</p>
<p>Now, this gives us a path to hire them and compensate them the way that we wanted to.</p>
<p>In these moments, I started crying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably had three or four moments and I realized like,</p>
<p>holy shit, I have had so much pent up emotion,</p>
<p>waiting for honestly, just like a normal average day.</p>
<p>Simple, humane, good things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to jump on the Biden bandwagon.</p>
<p>I think that he&rsquo;s got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>But I do think that just at a level, simple, basic level of humanity,</p>
<p>it was a different, it was a big sea change.</p>
<p>How did you take it?</p>
<p>Freeberg? I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>Did you cry as well?</p>
<p>I observed the inauguration.</p>
<p>It was interesting.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t upgrade your firmware, sorry.</p>
<p>We were supposed to push the two David firmwares for the ability to cry.</p>
<p>But did you feel any emotion of the three emotions we&rsquo;ve given you</p>
<p>in your programming?</p>
<p>Did any of them move at all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t remember the origin of my non-emotional</p>
<p>characterization, Jason.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Just based on every interaction we&rsquo;ve ever had with you, but continue.</p>
<p>Right. I guess that makes sense.</p>
<p>So I feel like the Biden moment on inauguration day,</p>
<p>it really did feel like a sigh of relief,</p>
<p>because so much of Trump love him or hate him</p>
<p>has been driven by a degree of tension, right?</p>
<p>He came in to office on the premise that he was going to drain the swamp.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a very active position.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to go in, he&rsquo;s going to change things.</p>
<p>And I think the Biden tone is like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all take a deep breath.</p>
<p>And I feel like that generated a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also say that I watched that with the eyes of someone who voted for Trump.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t vote for Trump.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think I voted this year.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>It was in the middle of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But I basically feel like there was a lot of folks&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say, let&rsquo;s unite the country when you&rsquo;re on the winning side.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re not, and you&rsquo;re sitting there,</p>
<p>and your guy got kicked out of office,</p>
<p>and your guy claimed that he got kicked out because of fraudulent activity,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re one of the 46% of Americans</p>
<p>that are already disapproving of Biden&rsquo;s performance in his first two days of office.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look at that as a moment of relief.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look at that as a moment of respite.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&rsquo;s a little bit of a missed point of view</p>
<p>in terms of how we&rsquo;re all covering it and talking about it.</p>
<p>It certainly feels good to take the tension down and take a deep breath</p>
<p>and have leadership not be putting the tension out there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of anger and disappointment still festering out there.</p>
<p>And I think we need to be very cognizant of why and what we can do.</p>
<p>And it would have been nice to see Biden not just say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s unite, but actually step over the line</p>
<p>and declare some of the policies and points of view of the other side</p>
<p>as being valid and engaging more directly on those points,</p>
<p>versus saying, we&rsquo;ll all work together in the future.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re already seeing this riff with McConnell and others</p>
<p>in terms of how to deal with the filibuster in a unified Senate.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Sachs, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll go to you, Chamath.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I&rsquo;m not going to swoon over an octogenarian</p>
<p>reading cliches off a teleprompter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, you know, the inauguration speech</p>
<p>struck all the right notes of, you know, reconciliation,</p>
<p>lowering the temperature, coming together.</p>
<p>These are the things you&rsquo;re supposed to say at an inauguration.</p>
<p>These are the presidential layups, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a weird thing that Trump could never quite get these layups in.</p>
<p>Biden did what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p>And I agree that there is a sense of relief in the temperature being lowered</p>
<p>and the situation in Washington feeling a bit depressurized.</p>
<p>And so, I think he deserves credit for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for the good.</p>
<p>I think the problem Biden&rsquo;s going to have is not just sort of the Trump right opposing him,</p>
<p>but the uncivil warriors in his own party.</p>
<p>Uncivil warriors, I think, was the most memorable line in his speech.</p>
<p>There are people, I think, you know, on the left</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t really on board with the reconciliation agenda.</p>
<p>I mean, shortly after the election, you had AOC proposing</p>
<p>a truth and reconciliation commission to go after everyone from the Trump era.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of reconciliation Biden&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>You have, I think, the oppressive hand of big tech</p>
<p>playing into this revenge agenda by acting as a speech cartel.</p>
<p>And now we have the rest of the tech stack jumping on board with the speech cartel.</p>
<p>You had an announcement from a whole bunch of finance companies, PayPal, Stripe, Square,</p>
<p>that said they would cancel the accounts and by implication livelihoods</p>
<p>of anyone connected to January 6th.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, there were many thousands of people at this rally on the mall.</p>
<p>Only a few percent of them breached the Capitol</p>
<p>and an even smaller percentage engaged in violence.</p>
<p>But everybody who was at the mall and really everyone in the MAGA movement</p>
<p>is, quote unquote, connected to that protest.</p>
<p>So how many degrees of Kevin Bacon are we going to play in acting out these reprisals?</p>
<p>And I think the worst part of all is that now we have in Congress</p>
<p>a bill put forward by Adam Schiff that basically would create a domestic Patriot Act</p>
<p>to create giant new surveillance powers for the state to go after people they deem to be</p>
<p>traitors and seditionists and domestic terrorists.</p>
<p>And I actually tweeted a letter by Rashida Tlaib of the squad opposing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve stood with the squad I was proud to</p>
<p>because the last thing the state needs right now is more surveillance powers.</p>
<p>And this idea that we&rsquo;re fighting a war against fellow Americans based on</p>
<p>basically political dissent, that&rsquo;s not going to create reconciliation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to lead to the next step in this horrible tit for tat game.</p>
<p>Just to build on this for a second.</p>
<p>There was a Rasmussen poll that came out today.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Friday, January 22nd.</p>
<p>So two days after the inauguration and Biden&rsquo;s disapproval rating is 45%.</p>
<p>And, you know, all of a sudden, you can think again, as you said,</p>
<p>three days ago, you know, a lot of people were on the losing side and are now on the winning side.</p>
<p>And today, a lot of people that were on the winning side are quote unquote,</p>
<p>on the losing side.</p>
<p>And you see how reflexive the reaction is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an auto hate, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like auto disapproval.</p>
<p>And so if that&rsquo;s the case, it just it just begs the question.</p>
<p>How much room and how much tolerance will we have as a society if we start to go after folks</p>
<p>that is, you know, that effectively have an enormous amount of political dissent?</p>
<p>Are there fringes of both parties that need to get basically found out,</p>
<p>exposed and put in jail, whether they&rsquo;re Antifa on the left or,</p>
<p>you know, the far right extremists on the right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But hopefully, the FBI already has enough power to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s already their remit.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re not going to have to do is pass an enormous number of laws.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve said this before, like, the Patriot Act was so crazy because</p>
<p>it was a foreign actor and a foreign event on domestic soil that created it.</p>
<p>But, you know, between the pandemic and now what happened in the Capitol,</p>
<p>a biological Patriot Act, a domestic Patriot Act, these are all in the offing.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re going to have to do is, again, it sounds cheesy, but find the common</p>
<p>ground so that we can expose who are at the fringes of both parties, who are the real crazy</p>
<p>people, round those folks up and deal with them with the laws that we have today, because</p>
<p>otherwise the unintended consequences for the overwhelming majority of the Americans who are</p>
<p>just normal folks is going to be a little scary.</p>
<p>I thought a really interesting reconciliation moment happened with the woman who stole</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s laptop.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys were have read that story.</p>
<p>But this woman who stole the laptop and was considering selling it to the Russians or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s 22 years old.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s obviously was misguided in doing this.</p>
<p>And the judge basically explained to her that she was releasing her to her mother&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, care and that her mother would go to jail if, you know, she did anything further.</p>
<p>But she said, listen, you know, you&rsquo;re a beneficiary of the Constitution.</p>
<p>You are getting a speedy trial.</p>
<p>You are getting representation.</p>
<p>And she used it almost as a civics lesson.</p>
<p>And I think we had a discussion, maybe two episodes when the pot got a little hot, which</p>
<p>was great for ratings, by the way, and for our relationships.</p>
<p>And it resulted in a reconciliation dinner that we had a little a little wives dinner.</p>
<p>Our wives brought us together for dinner to just make sure everything was on the well.</p>
<p>Chamath Chamath brought us together for dinner and brought us and brought wives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And no, I mean, it was it was a good thing, because frankly, Jason, I was starting to</p>
<p>hate you just just a little bit, but I could feel the hate, you know.</p>
<p>And Chamath being empathetic as he is recognize the situation.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve decided to do, you know, at least a quarterly besties dinner to make sure that</p>
<p>yeah, that the contentiousness does not get out of hand and interfere with our friendships,</p>
<p>which are more important than our politics.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that&rsquo;s what we all hope is comes out of this podcast, which is a deeper understanding</p>
<p>and reconciliation of of issues that we disagree on.</p>
<p>And breaking bread, having a meal or having a civil conversation, even if it gets a little</p>
<p>heated, keeping it civil is important.</p>
<p>I thought that this is the way to handle it.</p>
<p>A lot of these we&rsquo;re going to be able to use some amount of judgment on the people who</p>
<p>storm the Capitol and say, okay, this person&rsquo;s misguided.</p>
<p>They took a selfie, this person broke windows.</p>
<p>And then this person, you know, threw a fire extinguisher at a cop.</p>
<p>And we have to make sure that the justice system is deployed in a fair way.</p>
<p>And more surveillance and more investigation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the solution.</p>
<p>I think more surveillance, more investigations.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because I think the FBI has the power today to do that.</p>
<p>And I think they should.</p>
<p>Like I said, they should find every single person involved, find the appropriate crime,</p>
<p>make sure that they&rsquo;re punished.</p>
<p>But the idea of passing broad sweeping surveillance powers over every American citizen is fucking</p>
<p>nuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bonkers.</p>
<p>And by the way, all that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s going to do is create these honeypots for foreign</p>
<p>governments to want to attack anyways, because if that capability exists, it exists in code</p>
<p>on servers somewhere.</p>
<p>And folks in China and other places will want to find out where that is, and they will be</p>
<p>attacking it all day long.</p>
<p>And so the last thing we need is we&rsquo;re already leaking enough information about ourselves</p>
<p>online willingly and unwittingly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want there to be a honeypot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>The second thing I just want to say is I thought it was incredible what Mitch McConnell did</p>
<p>just back to your comment, Jason, about making sure folks get the right adjudication.</p>
<p>I think Mitch McConnell set the stage to have Donald Trump impeached.</p>
<p>And the reason I think that is this was the first time he was completely unequivocal,</p>
<p>which is that Donald Trump provoked all these folks.</p>
<p>And I think what it allows the Republican Party to do is to get together under closed</p>
<p>doors, you know, behind closed doors, circle the wagons and say it&rsquo;s either him or us,</p>
<p>we choose right now.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s going to happen if I had to guess is that that allows a lot of people</p>
<p>to break ranks and support the impeachment in the Senate that&rsquo;s going to start on Monday.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a real chance now that that this impeachment goes through and he</p>
<p>gets convicted.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth just thinking about the implications of that.</p>
<p>If you did that, there are there are Trump loyalists, there aren&rsquo;t really GOP loyalists.</p>
<p>And I guess there are GOP loyalists.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of Trump loyalists that are not loyal to the GOP at this point.</p>
<p>And Saxe, you know, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>But if Trump does actually create a fringe party, does create a patriot party, as he</p>
<p>suggested he might, you could see up to 20 million Americans joining that party.</p>
<p>And, you know, that would reduce the ranks of the Republican Party significantly.</p>
<p>And in kind of my understanding is in political theory, what would result is you always have</p>
<p>a balance in the parties.</p>
<p>And so the parties kind of adjust left or right to create that balance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s just kind of the organic way this works.</p>
<p>In order for the Republican Party to gain, you would probably see a lot of membership</p>
<p>move over to the Republican Party, which means that the Democratic Party is going to move</p>
<p>further left.</p>
<p>And, you know, think about the implications of that.</p>
<p>If Trump does actually if they do actually kick Trump out of the party, and he does set</p>
<p>up a fringe party, you will likely see the Democrats move further left, creating a much</p>
<p>more kind of conflicting story for some of the centrists than what they&rsquo;re telling today</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very different America in the next two to three years that could be created</p>
<p>if they took that risk.</p>
<p>And I think they have to associate that calculus when they&rsquo;re making this decision.</p>
<p>You know, you can talk about justice and wanting to kick him out of the party.</p>
<p>But the implications of him leaving the party are rather profound.</p>
<p>Oh, it would fracture the Republican Party.</p>
<p>It would be, I guess, the best historical analog would be when Teddy Roosevelt left</p>
<p>the party to form the Bull Moose Party.</p>
<p>He actually fractured the Republican Party.</p>
<p>And that allowed, I think, Woodrow Wilson to win the presidency, beating Taft.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the Republicans would basically lose every election from now until Trump is</p>
<p>no longer, you know, a force in American politics.</p>
<p>If he created, I guess, or they&rsquo;d have to move left, right?</p>
<p>I mean, in order for them to gain, you know, more people, they&rsquo;d have to get the centrist</p>
<p>Democrats.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have to move left, and that&rsquo;ll give the Democrats the ability to move left.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it would be a dream scenario for the Democrat Party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised at the end of the day if enough Republicans went along with this to</p>
<p>fracture the party.</p>
<p>But look, I understand that on some basis, you know, Trump caused what happened at the</p>
<p>Capitol.</p>
<p>He convened everybody.</p>
<p>He rabble roused.</p>
<p>But I think that, frankly, if you have a trial, I think the question we have to ask is, like,</p>
<p>what agenda does this serve?</p>
<p>Does this serve a reconciliation agenda, or does this serve a revenge agenda?</p>
<p>I mean, the guy&rsquo;s already out of office.</p>
<p>I thought we canceled the Trump reality show.</p>
<p>And this is like bringing it back for another season, because this trial is going to be</p>
<p>a shit show, just like all things Trump.</p>
<p>You have a trial in the Senate, and it&rsquo;s going to turn into a total farce, okay?</p>
<p>And, you know, look, I think cosmically, Trump was reckless.</p>
<p>He was responsible.</p>
<p>But when you actually look at the legal definition of incitement, it&rsquo;s actually very hard to</p>
<p>prove incitement.</p>
<p>So now Trump&rsquo;s going to get his lawyers up there, and they&rsquo;re going to be pushing back</p>
<p>on this, and it&rsquo;s going to consume the country for months.</p>
<p>And I just think we should be moving forward right now.</p>
<p>The guy&rsquo;s already out of office.</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be three days and done.</p>
<p>Why would it take months?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just saying you overhang from it?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to start it mid-February, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be three days.</p>
<p>This goes on until the trial&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;ll be at least a week of discussion, right, Sax?</p>
<p>So, Sax, is it, do you think the GOP preventing Trump from being able to run again is worth</p>
<p>the week of animosity, let&rsquo;s call it?</p>
<p>I think we should just move on as a country.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s good for Biden&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<p>I mean, this will become very consuming.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good for the GOP, though?</p>
<p>As a person who would align themselves with Republicans mainly, I would say, what do you</p>
<p>think is best for your party, the party you&rsquo;re a part of?</p>
<p>Just moving on, just moving forward.</p>
<p>What if Trump comes back and gets the nomination in 2024?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that is definitely a risk you take.</p>
<p>But I think that-</p>
<p>Do you want to take that risk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it to the voters to decide what makes sense.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I think that the only salvation for the Republicans is to repudiate Trump.</p>
<p>And I actually agree with Friedberg.</p>
<p>I think that this creates the opportunity for this, I think Trump wants to call it the</p>
<p>Patriot Party, to be sort of center-right.</p>
<p>I think Democrats probably ebb over time, you know, center-left.</p>
<p>And then the Republicans actually are this interesting power broker, because they can</p>
<p>actually tack to the middle and be centrist, you know, about a social safety net combined</p>
<p>with, you know, small government.</p>
<p>If you could somehow tiptoe and balance on that line, I think that is the winning strategy</p>
<p>that people want.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s my point is the Republican Party is going to have to move left in order</p>
<p>to create balance between the two parties again, because they are going to lose 20 million</p>
<p>voters to the Patriot Party.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the profound shift that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And when the Republican Party moves left, the Democrats are going to move further left.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>Maybe, I don&rsquo;t think that moving that far left is a really winning strategy for them.</p>
<p>No, but I think I think Friedberg is right.</p>
<p>So as an example, I think I can say this, but like I had a call this week with the mayor</p>
<p>of Miami, Francis Suarez.</p>
<p>What an unbelievably impressive guy.</p>
<p>Holy fucking shit.</p>
<p>This guy is amazing.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s done in Miami is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the GDP growth is like Chinese GDP growth, 10%, 8%, 6 and a half percent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running fiscal surpluses.</p>
<p>You know, crime is down, down, down.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done an incredible job.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s a fundamental centrist.</p>
<p>You know, and when you talk about what his beliefs are, I was like, what is this guy?</p>
<p>Is he a Democrat?</p>
<p>Is he Republican?</p>
<p>I was like, he&rsquo;s like, honestly, I&rsquo;m a centrist, you know?</p>
<p>And so my point is, if whoever tacks to the middle will find the ability to attract incredible</p>
<p>leaders that I think are our next generation set of leadership.</p>
<p>So in that way, Trump as a change agent,</p>
<p>Sachs, was a success in that he broke the system.</p>
<p>And this was Peter Thiel&rsquo;s kind of concept when he put him in.</p>
<p>And I know you don&rsquo;t speak for Peter, but Peter&rsquo;s idea was, hey, this person&rsquo;s a change agent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be this, you know, drain the swamp person.</p>
<p>Maybe that didn&rsquo;t happen, but he has basically made everybody reconsider what party they want</p>
<p>to be part of and what they actually want on the political agenda.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re so we&rsquo;ve never been more focused on politics and how our country runs in our</p>
<p>lifetime, have we?</p>
<p>Well, Trump, you&rsquo;re right that Trump was a classic disrupter.</p>
<p>Keith Rablois has this line about founders that</p>
<p>disruption is created by disruptive people.</p>
<p>And Trump was, you know, one of those very disruptive people.</p>
<p>I mean, just to take two examples, I mean, he created a total realignment on our views</p>
<p>around China.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s now a bipartisan consensus that, you know, we should not keep feeding</p>
<p>China and making, you know, keep feeding that the Chinese tiger and turning into a dragon.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to think now that summary appraisal is warranted.</p>
<p>And the other big issue was the forever wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>You know, I think Trump first created a realignment within the Republican Party when he said,</p>
<p>no more bushes.</p>
<p>He meant no more of these stupid foreign wars.</p>
<p>And I think that was an important realignment.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s been a very disruptive figure.</p>
<p>I think that everyone&rsquo;s breathing a sigh of relief because we&rsquo;ve moved on.</p>
<p>I think that he unnecessarily was incendiary and sort of pressurized the situation.</p>
<p>But I think the best thing at this point is to move forward and not keep rehashing the Trump era.</p>
<p>Speaking of rehashing, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know about what is happening with Facebook,</p>
<p>but they have an oversight board they created last year in the spring.</p>
<p>And the oversight board is not to do the day to day policing of Facebook and Instagram and</p>
<p>WhatsApp activity, but it is to be a place where people who have been have had content removed or</p>
<p>have had their account suspended to appeal. They have taken the Trump case, as it were,</p>
<p>and given it to their Supreme Court, which is the oversight board.</p>
<p>And the oversight board is going to make a judgment basically on should Trump get his</p>
<p>social media accounts back. They have complete autonomy from Facebook. They are funded by</p>
<p>Facebook with 120 or 130 million dollars over the next six years. So they&rsquo;re getting like</p>
<p>20 million dollars a year to run this. They&rsquo;ve got a really amazing bench of intellectuals,</p>
<p>public intellectuals, and they&rsquo;re sort of above Facebook in this regard. What do we think</p>
<p>should happen to Trump&rsquo;s social media accounts? Should he have a path to reclaiming them?</p>
<p>And with this board that exists as this a budsman, as I talked about in the last episode,</p>
<p>what do we think of this process? And do we think maybe Twitter and YouTube should join this</p>
<p>oversight board? Let&rsquo;s separate these two things. And actually, Jason, you just framed it perfectly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s separate the two issues. One is, is any of us comfortable with a random set of people that</p>
<p>some people will like and other people not like making these decisions on our behalf that are not</p>
<p>necessarily trained to make these decisions? I mean, these aren&rsquo;t elected trained judges or</p>
<p>lawyers that sit for a bar exam. These are just, you know, private citizens ultimately at the end</p>
<p>of the day. I think that if you allow this to happen at scale, there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch</p>
<p>of decisions that you&rsquo;ll be okay with and support. I think a lot of people probably are cheering when</p>
<p>Trump got blocked. But if you can abstract it away and think about all the people that you</p>
<p>actually care about, what if the administration was on the other side, and now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you know, these people to curry favor with the administration went in a different direction and</p>
<p>people that you cared about got blocked. It is an untenable situation. And I think this is the</p>
<p>slippery slope that the framers never intended. I don&rsquo;t think it should be people like this,</p>
<p>making any decision like this. And in many ways, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fig leaf for these companies to</p>
<p>pretend they&rsquo;re doing the right thing while they&rsquo;re really shirking the real responsibility.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you agree?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say on this specific. So I think we should just take a broader point of view on this,</p>
<p>which is how do tech companies create independence in the platforms that they&rsquo;re building so that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get scrutinized as monopolists. And so there are several examples of this being done,</p>
<p>both successfully and not successfully across the tech ecosystem. Google made Android open source.</p>
<p>And by making the Android operating system open source, they were able to have their own forked</p>
<p>versions that they were able to install on phones with partners like HTC and Samsung and others,</p>
<p>that they could then have their search engine be the primary search engine.</p>
<p>So the entire Android operating system is available for anyone to work on for anyone to fork for</p>
<p>anyone to use. And then Google&rsquo;s iteration of that open source platform and Google&rsquo;s contributions,</p>
<p>which they were making regularly, allowed them to kind of have a great commercial outcome without</p>
<p>being the owner of the operating system, having learned from the mistakes of Microsoft in the past.</p>
<p>Facebook tried to take a similar approach with Libra, and it was a total shit show and a disaster.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it is today. But they tried to create this also independent board</p>
<p>to provide oversight and to kind of do all the open source work on the Libra currency.</p>
<p>And Facebook was going to then use that on their platform as their kind of token cryptocurrency</p>
<p>solution. And obviously, there was so much scrutiny because no one believed the independence.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re hearing the same thing now about the Facebook Oversight Board.</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey is now taking the same approach with Blue Sky, which is meant to be this open sourced,</p>
<p>you know, independently managed social media protocol system. And so Twitter would effectively</p>
<p>become an application layer on top of this open sourced approach to how do you decide what goes</p>
<p>on social media, how do you decide what&rsquo;s inappropriate and appropriate, and what</p>
<p>technology protocols are available for everyone to use and what business and arbitration protocols</p>
<p>are available for everyone to use in an open sourced way. And we&rsquo;ll see where Jack goes with</p>
<p>Blue Sky, he seems to be doing a better job messaging and organizing teams of people to work</p>
<p>on this. And I don&rsquo;t see the pushback that Facebook is getting with their oversight board.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, a lot of these the big tech platforms in order to avoid the monopolistic</p>
<p>allegations and the allegations of control and influence, they&rsquo;re creating independence,</p>
<p>independent systems, and the titter miss. And I don&rsquo;t think we yet know, I think in the next</p>
<p>year or two, we&rsquo;ll see how Blue Sky, Libra, the Facebook Oversight Board, and some of these other</p>
<p>platform, what would you do, David? What would you do? Let me just put it to you. If you were</p>
<p>in charge, you were the CEO of Facebook or Twitter, would you have a path to reinstating</p>
<p>Trump? Yes or no? Yeah, let me just get freebergs. Would you? Yes or no?</p>
<p>reinstate Trump? Oh, yeah, 100%. We should have a path to it. I think the like I&rsquo;ve said in the</p>
<p>past, having some objective, I think that number one, I don&rsquo;t think it was inappropriate for them</p>
<p>to kick him off the platform from a legal perspective. I don&rsquo;t Saxon, I might disagree,</p>
<p>but we can probably argue for an hour. But I think from a freedom of speech point of view,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re private companies with private accounts, and they did what they wanted to do. Was it the</p>
<p>right thing to do? I don&rsquo;t think that was the right thing. So you give him a path to getting</p>
<p>his account back. And so I think you need to create an objective system. And you need to give</p>
<p>everyone whether it&rsquo;s Trump or whomever else, everyone has to have the same set of standards</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re held to. And then a universal approach that anyone can appeal and okay,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the approach. But knowing what Trump did on January 6, would you let him back on your</p>
<p>platform? If you were CEO, is the question I&rsquo;m trying to get out of your free bird. But okay,</p>
<p>David, you go? Yeah, I mean, so so here&rsquo;s the fundamental problem is that the town square</p>
<p>is now owned by Facebook and Twitter, the town square got privatized, and our speech rights are</p>
<p>now in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey as a practical matter. I mean, you do not</p>
<p>have speech rights in the modern world if you get deplatformed by big tech. And until now, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been no way to appeal their decisions. We have had no transparency into their decisions. So I think</p>
<p>Facebook creating this appeals board is a step in the right direction. But you know, they&rsquo;re calling</p>
<p>it their Supreme Court. But I&rsquo;ll tell you, my Supreme Court is the Supreme Court. You know,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, we all know that the most important part of a trial is jury selection. And</p>
<p>Zuckerberg is still picking these 20 people. And, you know, actually, just in case in point,</p>
<p>he picked the top, he picked the four, and the four pick the next 16. And then they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an ongoing ability to pick the next ones. And they have some amount of terms. So just to give you</p>
<p>that. Okay, well, fair enough. And like I said, Look, I don&rsquo;t want to criticize this move on its</p>
<p>own, because it is a step in the right direction. We need an appeals process when people get</p>
<p>canceled. Okay. That part is good. But what I would like to see, like I said,</p>
<p>my Supreme Court is a Supreme Court, and they&rsquo;ve spoken to this issue. And I would like to see</p>
<p>these social networking monopolies apply a First Amendment standard, a speech policy broadly</p>
<p>consistent with the First Amendment. And sometimes that will mean allowing speech we don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>but it will result in a greater level of speech protection for all of us.</p>
<p>Well, it will allow speech back on the platform. No, but hold on a sec. If you&rsquo;re going to go by</p>
<p>that standard, the problem is with this Oversight Board concept is that it completely violates</p>
<p>exactly what the Supreme Court is meant to be, which is a country by country set of governance</p>
<p>and standards and laws. Like I&rsquo;m just looking at the Oversight Board people right now. These</p>
<p>people look incredibly well credentialed. ME Palmore of Israel, Catalina Botero Marino of</p>
<p>Colombia, Niga Dad from Pakistan, Hele Thorning Schmidt from Denmark, Catherine Chen from Taiwan,</p>
<p>Jamal Green from the United States, Alan Rusbridger from UK, Andreas Sajo from Hungary,</p>
<p>and it goes on and on. How are we supposed to adjudicate a set of standards at a national</p>
<p>level? Like when we have the are all these people from all these different countries supposed to</p>
<p>apply on US constitutional right of free speech and have the idea would be they would use some</p>
<p>global standard, but then also take into consideration local standards. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stated purposes and why they&rsquo;re so diverse. The setup for that, though, Jason,</p>
<p>is that then we know when, when there&rsquo;s a, you know, the Hindu nationalist BJP party has a</p>
<p>specific point of view. And so when Modi wants to get elected, there&rsquo;s going to be specific kinds of</p>
<p>free speech laws there, you know, Poland&rsquo;s gonna have a different point of view, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to respect what&rsquo;s happening in the Oversight Board case in point. Australia passed a potential</p>
<p>law, or is considering passing a law, which is basically around if you know, treating Facebook</p>
<p>and Google as quasi publishers, and that, you know, they&rsquo;re, I think that they have to pay some</p>
<p>kind of royalty now for articles that are shared or published or whatever. And Google said, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>And then Facebook said, I&rsquo;m out too. So what does that mean for, you know, 200 million people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out? What does that mean? You&rsquo;re out, you can make money when the getting&rsquo;s good. And all</p>
<p>of a sudden, you build this public infrastructure, when the country&rsquo;s rules change, I actually</p>
<p>respect that more than trying to create some of this broad, holistic governance committee,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a shit show. You can&rsquo;t cherry pick which laws you want to observe and respect</p>
<p>and, and then which laws you don&rsquo;t. You know, I think Jamal makes an excellent point about</p>
<p>how difficult this is going to be to implement. Let me propose an alternative that actually comes</p>
<p>from a former law professor of mine at the University of Chicago, Richard Epstein. He</p>
<p>made the point that he wants to apply common carrier regulation, at least in the US to these</p>
<p>monopolies. And the example he gives is that the railroad monopolies could not deny you service</p>
<p>based on your political views. And, you know, this is, this is a, this is a real issue. Imagine,</p>
<p>you know, going back in time, you know, we had the Lincoln Douglas debates, for example,</p>
<p>the way that Lincoln and Douglas went around the country was by train. Imagine if some railroad</p>
<p>magnate some oligarch said, Mr. Lincoln, I don&rsquo;t like your views, I&rsquo;m not going to give you</p>
<p>passage on my railroad monopoly, the common carrier rules would have prevented them from</p>
<p>doing that. And what Epstein suggests we do is, if you&rsquo;re a essentially a monopoly, a speech</p>
<p>monopoly in the in the US, one of these platforms that has, you know, the gigantic network effects,</p>
<p>you have to apply the common carrier rules. It&rsquo;s an interesting concept. I think let&rsquo;s move on to</p>
<p>the economy. And it&rsquo;d be very interesting. We&rsquo;ll monitor obviously, what the this oversight board</p>
<p>does, we&rsquo;re going to monitor what&rsquo;s going to happen with this January 6.</p>
<p>Sorry, Jason, the last thing on this is you can you can tell if you if you graft and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>somebody listening to all end can graph and tweet this, but if you graft the price to earnings ratio</p>
<p>of big tech, as all of these issues have come out, like, you know, if you looked at a time series of</p>
<p>their PE, and you put on there, you know, things like George Floyd, things like the Capitol riots,</p>
<p>you know, all of these things that have created these flashpoint issues around free speech,</p>
<p>flashpoints, the, the massacre in New Zealand and Christchurch that was live streamed on Facebook,</p>
<p>all of this stuff, what you&rsquo;ll see is, at least capitalism is voting that these companies will</p>
<p>not be allowed to be companies much longer. The smart money is betting that they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be regulated, and something&rsquo;s going to change, it&rsquo;s going to be a quasi governmental organization,</p>
<p>exactly that the level of regulation at a government by government level,</p>
<p>is going to be so onerous as to make these companies quasi nonprofits that work on behalf</p>
<p>of countries, they&rsquo;re going to become utilities, right, they&rsquo;re getting they&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>regulated, like utilities at some point, or they&rsquo;re going to have to adopt some governance,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve talked about, or other options will emerge. And I think what Jack is doing with the</p>
<p>is a blue sky is what they&rsquo;re calling it blue sky. Yeah, yeah, what they&rsquo;re really doing with</p>
<p>blue sky is saying your profile and your data is going to be stored on some blockchain or</p>
<p>some decentralized system like Bitcoin or like any other peer to peer service, which means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not on their server, Twitter just pulls all that data together. So we would all have our own</p>
<p>domain names and calacanis.com or sax.com slash profile dot whatever the HTML equivalent is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it dot social, you know, your sax dot social URL would be your profile on Facebook,</p>
<p>Twitter and everywhere else. And when you post it to it, it would post to Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Therefore, they could say we don&rsquo;t actually host this stuff, we&rsquo;re just pulling it together,</p>
<p>which then destroys their business model perch moths point, what do we think, as a little aside,</p>
<p>is going to happen with the tick tock case? Now that Trump is out of office, and Biden is in</p>
<p>office, we sort of alluded to China sacks being a super important thing that we all have consensus</p>
<p>on now what should happen with tick tock? And do you think Biden will go after tick tock and say,</p>
<p>hey, we got to get this out of here? Because it&rsquo;s, you know, essentially spyware and jacquemus was</p>
<p>just resurfaced. And let&rsquo;s just talk about China for a second.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the sad reality is that the whole tick tock thing is going to get swept under the</p>
<p>rug. I think there&rsquo;ll be no restrictions on tick tock. I think what we need, the issue with like,</p>
<p>with banning tick tock, though, is that it&rsquo;s just one place where China can collect data on all of</p>
<p>us. I mean, the reality is, there&rsquo;s 1000s of places. And so, you know, I do think that taking</p>
<p>some action on tick tock is warranted, but it would it is a little bit of selective enforcement.</p>
<p>But what I would like to see is some guarantee some assurance that that tick tock is not is</p>
<p>collecting data in the way they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re collecting it and that there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sort of spyware within the app. And I don&rsquo;t think we know for sure whether there&rsquo;s spyware or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it, I&rsquo;ll say it slightly differently. I&rsquo;ve maintained this for a while, but it is</p>
<p>inconceivable that inside of big tech at every single company that you define big tech is not</p>
<p>at least one spy from Russia, China, India, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Did I tell you guys I had a spy working for me a climate? No, you got to rest. No, tell us the</p>
<p>story. It&rsquo;s public. So I&rsquo;ll share it. We had a data scientist named Hightower, great guy,</p>
<p>worked on our remote sensing team, and worked on our nitrogen model, which predicted nitrogen</p>
<p>content in soil and was very deep in the in the in the code base and everything. And shortly after</p>
<p>I had left, I found out this so climate, just for the audience, what my company I started and ran</p>
<p>was acquired by Monsanto in 2013, which is a big seed company, a lot of people know it for other</p>
<p>things. And, and so I left, and I found out that the guy quit, went to the airport, and the FBI</p>
<p>intercepted him at the airport, and they found tucked into his bag, a thumb drive, and he had</p>
<p>downloaded all of our code base for our nitrogen models. And he was taking them to give them to the</p>
<p>Chinese government. And so he&rsquo;s in jail right now. He&rsquo;s in prison in the US right now. But this was</p>
<p>like the most nondescript, super nice scientist, data scientist guy you&rsquo;ve ever met, like you would</p>
<p>have had zero suspicion. And, and it turns out, this is the point, how many of those exist in</p>
<p>Facebook, and it was so by the way, it was so easy for him to get access to our code base. And he</p>
<p>pulled all this stuff down. And he had the whole model. And you know, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>articles about what happened in our case. But you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s happening all over the place.</p>
<p>And, and I don&rsquo;t think that we fully appreciate like, how much of America&rsquo;s IP is stored in</p>
<p>software, and data, and how accessible that is to employees inside of these organizations,</p>
<p>and that the security is not adequate to protect that data and that IP.</p>
<p>And then the crazy thing is, like, you know, when just to connect the two dots here on this</p>
<p>jack muffin, like when you saw that video, were like, you know, basically, he was forced to,</p>
<p>you know, show field. I&rsquo;m okay. And, you know, this is all about the Chinese party held captive.</p>
<p>Hmm. My gosh, like, I mean, these are all quasi governmental companies.</p>
<p>Alibaba exists, because of the largest of the Communist Party and Xi Jinping,</p>
<p>if that wasn&rsquo;t clear after last week, I mean, and so to your point, like, you know, if any company</p>
<p>gets a hold of US user data, or otherwise, it&rsquo;s effectively the Chinese government getting ahold</p>
<p>of that data. Yeah, we don&rsquo;t need proof, David, when Jack Ma disappears, and then comes back and</p>
<p>looks, he looked nervous on that video. I&rsquo;m no expert, but he did not look like he was the Jack</p>
<p>Ma, who was giving speeches and inspiring people. And I don&rsquo;t know what this does to entrepreneurship</p>
<p>in China. But I mean, who in China is going to start a company now and want to be the next</p>
<p>Jack Ma or Jeff Bezos? No, I think I think Jason, it&rsquo;s even simpler, what happens,</p>
<p>it makes it makes entrepreneurship even simpler, meaning for those entrepreneurs that thought that</p>
<p>there was a balance between financial imperative and moral imperative, there&rsquo;s no balance,</p>
<p>you can flush the moral imperative down the fucking toilet, they China will allow you to</p>
<p>get super rich, and super successful, as long as you super toe the line. And that&rsquo;s the message.</p>
<p>Right? It&rsquo;s like what Putin did with Khodorkovsky in Russia. It&rsquo;s like he basically told all the</p>
<p>oligarchs you work for us now. And, and that&rsquo;s basically that it worked. That&rsquo;s basically the</p>
<p>message from the CCP to Jack Ma, and to every other entrepreneur in China is you work for us</p>
<p>now. And by the way, civil military fusion was part was was a policy expressly announced by</p>
<p>President Xi. You know, one other data point on this, I think is really interesting is that Biden</p>
<p>just announced that he was keeping on Christopher Wray as the head of the FBI. Christopher Wray gave</p>
<p>a speech back in July at the Hudson Institute about the counter espionage efforts that the</p>
<p>FBI is engaged in. And he was saying that the FBI has more cases now related to, to Chinese</p>
<p>counterintelligence. He said that the FBI is opening a new China related counterintelligence</p>
<p>case every 10 hours, and to a day and of the of the nearly 5000 active FBI counterintelligence</p>
<p>cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China. So this is</p>
<p>directly from a speech he gave in July. So I think it&rsquo;s really interesting. Now at the time that he</p>
<p>gave the speech, you know, a lot of people were saying, well, this is just Trump&rsquo;s more of Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>China baiting. But I think that by Biden keeping on Chris, Christopher Wray, there&rsquo;s a continuity</p>
<p>of policy there. And I think, you know, focusing on tick tock is probably the wrong thing. We need</p>
<p>a more comprehensive policy to deal with counterintelligence. Well, it&rsquo;s a good start,</p>
<p>though, to say, if you hit scale, we&rsquo;re not going to let you operate here. And we want reciprocity.</p>
<p>Adding to this outgoing Secretary Pompeo, and is the day before the inauguration,</p>
<p>tweeted, I have determined that the People&rsquo;s Republic of China is committing genocide</p>
<p>and crimes against humanity in China targeting the Uyghurs, Muslims and members of other ethnic</p>
<p>and religious minority groups. That&rsquo;s quite a bomb to leave the day before. And I think this signals</p>
<p>we are going to keep resetting this relationship. And what an incredible opportunity for us to bring</p>
<p>factories back here bring, as we&rsquo;ve talked about here, manufacturing back, correct, Friedberg?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think. Let&rsquo;s kick it off. We got we got 3 million, 3 million factories in China.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got less than 100,000 in America.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go and it will be so glorious. It will be so fucking glorious. I mean,</p>
<p>think about this, right? Look, think about the amount of money like at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what is a government&rsquo;s purpose? Is it to run a profit? No. You know, that&rsquo;s our job,</p>
<p>right? Is it to run at break even? I would actually say no. I think it&rsquo;s to basically</p>
<p>promote the prosperity of current and future generations of its citizens.</p>
<p>And so you should be investing. So if this is the perfect investment,</p>
<p>so if we&rsquo;re going to be printing, you know, trillions of dollars, and you know,</p>
<p>we should talk about the stimulus bill, because Biden&rsquo;s going to rip in another 2 trillion,</p>
<p>which I think is a perfect segue. And then by the way, and then after that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be this, it&rsquo;s amazing infrastructure bill, put the money to work,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s reclaim a bunch of this capability on shore and let&rsquo;s rebuild America.</p>
<p>Okay, Friedberg, you looked at the $1.2 trillion stimulus package that Biden is</p>
<p>proposing. How much of that goes towards rebuilding factories in America?</p>
<p>Well, none. So remember, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a 1.9 billion, 1.9 trillion. Yeah. And so just to put that in context,</p>
<p>you know, Wall Street has talked about there were going to be four,</p>
<p>four massive stimulus bills, you know, since last April, May, I think they&rsquo;ve talked about this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this come to fruition now. And Chamath, correct me if you&rsquo;ve heard differently.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always been the expectation, we would have the big first stimulus,</p>
<p>which we had last March, then a second stimulus, people have been waiting for the state stimulus</p>
<p>or the local government stimulus, which this one now it captures. And then the fourth program was</p>
<p>always going to be infrastructure. And we haven&rsquo;t seen details of the proposed Biden infrastructure</p>
<p>plan yet. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s going to have a lot of green energy stuff tied up in it. But</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s just hit the numbers, right. So in 2009, post financial crisis to keep the</p>
<p>global economy from collapsing, Congress passed an $800 billion aid package,</p>
<p>800 billion was extraordinary at the time, and we&rsquo;d never seen anything like it,</p>
<p>TARP. And last March, if you&rsquo;ll recall, we passed this emergency $2 trillion package,</p>
<p>you know, more than 2x what we had during the financial crisis. And now just in December,</p>
<p>right before the year wrapped up, Congress passed another $900 billion package.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re talking about this $1.9 trillion package getting passed. So we&rsquo;ve eclipsed</p>
<p>anything you could have ever considered possible in terms of fiscal stimulus. At this point,</p>
<p>the M1 money supply, which I sent the link out ahead of this for share has gone up by 75%</p>
<p>in just the past year. And now if we break down the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill,</p>
<p>you know, a huge chunk of it and this is what Wall Street&rsquo;s been waiting for</p>
<p>is $350 billion is going to state and local governments. So think about San Francisco or</p>
<p>the state of California, the city of Chicago, the city of New York, all of these folks have</p>
<p>seen their revenue decline, and they&rsquo;ve had to run massive emergency programs.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that money coming from? They haven&rsquo;t been able to raise taxes, they&rsquo;ve had to put a hold on</p>
<p>receipts. And so this is meant to bridge the gap at the local level. And this is really important,</p>
<p>because so much of capital markets still very much fund local and state governments through</p>
<p>municipal bonds. And those bonds, if they start to default, are going to have a dangerous rippling</p>
<p>effect in the economy. So bridging the state and local government budgets with this $350 billion</p>
<p>package turned out to be, you know, an absolute need and the Republicans prior to the election</p>
<p>were pushing hard against this and saying, let those states fail. They&rsquo;re mostly blue states,</p>
<p>let those cities fail. They&rsquo;re mostly blue cities, they&rsquo;re mismanaged, they&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>stupid about how they&rsquo;re operating. So this is a big deal. There&rsquo;s 160 billion for COVID fighting,</p>
<p>some of which, you know, I throw up on $20 billion for vaccination, which equates to</p>
<p>about $150 per person they expect to vaccinate, which is an extraordinarily high cost. If you</p>
<p>actually think about it on a first principles basis, it&rsquo;s ridiculous how inefficient they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be at this $50 billion for testing $40 billion for protective gear and supplies.</p>
<p>And what this indicates to me is so much of what goes on in government and government spending</p>
<p>is skating to where the puck used to be not skating to where the puck is going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like by the time this money gets deployed, I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re going to need as much</p>
<p>protective gear and supplies. I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re going to need as much testing if we can actually</p>
<p>get the vaccinations done in the next 90 to 100 days. And much of the country starts to recover</p>
<p>from this. You know, you&rsquo;ve now got $150 billion program sitting out there that doesn&rsquo;t need to be</p>
<p>out there. And it&rsquo;s a waste of money. What we should be doing is taking that money and investing</p>
<p>in biomanufacturing infrastructure. So we can more quickly develop and deploy vaccines in the future.</p>
<p>What would it cost to build a factory just back of the envelope that was capable of making</p>
<p>the next? You know, let&rsquo;s call it one to 1,000,000,000 shots.</p>
<p>One to it&rsquo;s not a lot. So it&rsquo;s not a lot. Let me I&rsquo;ll give you guys the unit economic build.</p>
<p>And you can do the math at home. four grams per liter is the expected yield of a of a</p>
<p>biomanufacturing facility. And a liter is like, you know, how many liters of water do you have</p>
<p>in a tank, you can build half million liter facilities for a couple $100 million. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>four grams per liter every seven days. And as vaccine or the the antibody therapies that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen, the antibody therapies are about two grams. And that&rsquo;ll save someone&rsquo;s life. The vaccines are</p>
<p>a fraction of a gram. And so you can start to kind of do the math on how just a few billion</p>
<p>dollars invested in building some of these biomanufacturing facilities that are modular</p>
<p>and can be very quickly reprogrammed to make a new molecule can be used to support the future</p>
<p>vaccine supply chain and the future anti antibody therapeutic supply chain, which is critically</p>
<p>needed in this country. And if I were to take $160 billion for COVID fighting, give me 10% of that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be ready for any virus in the future. And we&rsquo;ll be able to print out vaccines for the</p>
<p>whole country within 30 days. And so a little bit again, of this is not really forward thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scientists and doctors saying what they need, what they&rsquo;re talking about is last year&rsquo;s</p>
<p>need. They&rsquo;re not thinking in terms of what the industrial supply chain needs are going to be in</p>
<p>the future on an ongoing basis for this country at this point, I&rsquo;m not seeing it. And so I feel a</p>
<p>little bit let down by that. And I hope that the infrastructure programs that are going to be</p>
<p>proposed in the next in the next bill, will start to encompass some of that work.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, it&rsquo;s going to cost a trillion dollars to upgrade our nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re literally going to spend a trillion dollars over the next decade,</p>
<p>upgrading our nuclear. Is that true? That&rsquo;s nutty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m reading a headline right here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my here&rsquo;s my little wish list for this infrastructure bill, I think, when you look at</p>
<p>some of the most compelling work that&rsquo;s happened in the developing world. So like, if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go and, you know, build a massive water facility or an energy installation, a lot of</p>
<p>people are worried, hey, listen, I have to deal with, you know, local currency risk, I have to</p>
<p>deal with, you know, corruption, I could have the government, you know, take away this facility from</p>
<p>me without notice, the rule of law may not be strong. And the World Bank has this mechanism</p>
<p>where you can basically go and ensure, you know, for I think it&rsquo;s like one or 2% of your project</p>
<p>costs the whole project. And it really makes things work. I would love to see the US government</p>
<p>effectively create a program that is similar but different in the following way. There are</p>
<p>some enormous things America needs to do, where the IP exists with our allies. And there is an</p>
<p>enormous fear, what would happen if that IP leaked specifically to China. One example is if you</p>
<p>believe and you care about climate change, and the making of batteries, there&rsquo;s an enormous</p>
<p>amount of IP that sits with the Japanese. That, you know, if we could license and work with,</p>
<p>as a country, we could build factories all over the country. And we would be the leader in climate.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;ll take the US government to basically work bilaterally with the Japanese government to</p>
<p>basically say, listen, if it takes the NSA to fucking protect this shit, we will do it.</p>
<p>But you can run them, they we could just give them their sovereignty in those facts.</p>
<p>You know, these are these are these are for profit companies that are, you know,</p>
<p>relatively risk averse, they&rsquo;re not going to rip in 10 million bucks to $10 billion to build,</p>
<p>you know, a cathode plant in the US, I would other people would. But that&rsquo;s my hope in the</p>
<p>infrastructure bill is that we take some of these things that have worked in the developing world,</p>
<p>and we use it to grease the skids in how we rebuild America, it would be fucking glorious.</p>
<p>And also just think about how much a nuclear power plant costs, it&rsquo;s like six to $9 billion</p>
<p>to build a nuclear power plant. And we haven&rsquo;t built many new ones. And we&rsquo;re on the way there.</p>
<p>But if part of this trillion dollars, we could build 10 more of those, energy independence</p>
<p>would continue and global warming would go down. Anything to add there, David looks like you want</p>
<p>to come Well, I did just one final word, you know, the, the, the great senate leader,</p>
<p>Everett Dirksen famously said that, you know, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about real money. And now we&rsquo;re talking about a trillion here and a trillion</p>
<p>there. And these are really big numbers. And I think we should be very concerned about debt and</p>
<p>deficits. No one&rsquo;s really talking about this yet. But all of this money has to be paid back at some</p>
<p>point. What&rsquo;s the worst that can happen, David, let&rsquo;s actually do that. I mean, I&rsquo;m asking the</p>
<p>question in a non joking way, what is the worst that can happen? Oh, I mean, inflation, inflation,</p>
<p>well, not not just so inflation, because the government will eventually have to monetize the</p>
<p>debt by printing more money, the dollar stops becoming the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, maybe</p>
<p>that Bitcoin becomes the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, maybe something else does. It could be lead to,</p>
<p>you know, very severe to basically a debt crisis in the future. What would that look like for</p>
<p>companies and citizens of America? Well, if you&rsquo;re middle, if you&rsquo;re middle class, your savings get</p>
<p>wiped out, you know, if so, so if you&rsquo;re super rich, the reality is there&rsquo;s already been tremendous</p>
<p>asset inflation. So there&rsquo;s already been a lot of inflation. But frankly, if you are very rich and</p>
<p>own assets in the stock market, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re sort of, you&rsquo;re protected, you know, but if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>middle class person with most of your savings in your bank account, that money is not worth a lot</p>
<p>less, you&rsquo;re destroyed, or your home, yeah, you get destroyed by that. Yeah, it&rsquo;s really very sad.</p>
<p>So if you aren&rsquo;t equities, and the market is on a rip, you know, paying an extra couple of million</p>
<p>dollars for your second home is not a big deal, because your equities have gone up more than that</p>
<p>are equal to that. And if you&rsquo;re right, somebody who gets makes income, we have a separate issue.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look, this is this is a this is a bigger issue. But I and I think we should talk about</p>
<p>this at some point, because this is what the grand fallacy of technology was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Like, you know, if you if you break down capitalism into its two most natural states,</p>
<p>you have labor and you have capital, right, you have workers and you have owners. And the biggest</p>
<p>problem that technology did was it drove a wedge and it created an extremely small owner class,</p>
<p>and an extremely massive labor class. And so the reality is that a very few very handful of people</p>
<p>can can get extremely wealthy by being owners of these next generation assets. And then everybody</p>
<p>else is essentially, you know, rendered as labor. And so this wealth inequality just grows and grows</p>
<p>in compounds. And so we have to figure out a way. Yeah, how&rsquo;s that different than the past?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s got I think I think technology accelerated that dynamic.</p>
<p>Well, I think jumping in on this, I mean, I think that technology creates bigger winner,</p>
<p>take all outcomes, and that&rsquo;s fed into inequality. But the good thing about tech or the tech ecosystem</p>
<p>is that frankly, we have option pools, right? We have broad based ownership of these companies.</p>
<p>If you go work for a Google or Facebook, whatever, you get</p>
<p>10,000 people, that&rsquo;s 10,000. No one and they&rsquo;re and they&rsquo;re replacing 2 million jobs with 10,000</p>
<p>people. I mean, this is why this is why we need to have 100% participation in the markets by</p>
<p>everybody in the country. Joe Greenblatt, who I had on my podcast recently is a proponent of this</p>
<p>chamath they saw you tweeting about it. When you&rsquo;re born in the United States, we should put $5,000</p>
<p>in a 401k that you can&rsquo;t touch until you&rsquo;re 65 years old. That is in whatever index funds</p>
<p>and every person born gets that $5,000 and cannot touch it. And then we see where it winds up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. It doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem that a lot of people have to climb up a hill first,</p>
<p>right? They take on a lot of debt to get education to put themselves in a position to ultimately be</p>
<p>able to generate the income to do that. And I think, you know, sure, give them $5,000 in the</p>
<p>beginning, but it&rsquo;s not going to get them where they need to be. But it does solve one portion</p>
<p>of the problem, which is they don&rsquo;t have participation. And we could take out the</p>
<p>wondering what your retirement is going to be like.</p>
<p>I think both of you are right. I think like there needs to be</p>
<p>something that allows people to have a line of sight to savings like a lot of about being invested</p>
<p>in anything where you own it, whether it&rsquo;s real estate, or whether it&rsquo;s a piece of artwork,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s stocks and bonds. So many people don&rsquo;t even know how to begin and don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the concept of ownership. And so they are stuck in being in the ghetto of labor. And I think like</p>
<p>one of the biggest things we can do is you can give them the taste of ownership so that they</p>
<p>understand that difference so that they want to be an owner. Okay, number one. And then to David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point, number two is we still have a responsibility to educate people so that they can actually have</p>
<p>skills that they can monetize. And we have a responsibility to do that. And right now,</p>
<p>we make it so fucking hard. And we trick people because like we send them down the path of</p>
<p>getting a $200,000 art history degree, and then they end up working at a Starbucks and then there,</p>
<p>which is impossible to monetize. I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous. You can&rsquo;t monetize that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t. By the way, what you&rsquo;re saying to mop is the reason I think retirement accounts</p>
<p>were set up in the US was to shift away from pension fund models where people were getting</p>
<p>a fixed income at retirement, and shifting them to a model of equity and ownership in the markets</p>
<p>where they could participate actively on a tax free basis. But obviously, it hasn&rsquo;t done enough.</p>
<p>I think the big difference between the Industrial Revolution, the first and second Industrial</p>
<p>Revolution and where we are with software in the last two to three decades is the capital required,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s very little capital to build a highly valuable software business. It required a lot of</p>
<p>capital to build oil infrastructure and railroad infrastructure and factories. And so to your point,</p>
<p>you get extraordinarily different outsized returns today than you did 100 years ago as an owner</p>
<p>versus labor. And the bridge to try and give people ownership through retirement accounts</p>
<p>certainly hasn&rsquo;t been enough. To your point, David, I saw this study. It was fucking crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get the exact numbers wrong, but the trend is accurate. When people used to actively</p>
<p>manage their 401k, there was a very small participation rate, but the mean return was</p>
<p>off the charts and the amount of dollars as a function of their paycheck was off the charts.</p>
<p>Call it 50, 60 cents of every theoretical dollar you could put into it. The minute that we went to</p>
<p>passive and that you could sort of trickle money in, the number of people that participated</p>
<p>literally more than doubled, but then the amount of that max dollar went off of a cliff.</p>
<p>And so the problem that we&rsquo;ve had is we haven&rsquo;t taught people. We&rsquo;ve misdirected some of them to</p>
<p>say, have a 401k. It replaces your pension as if it&rsquo;s the solution. That&rsquo;s still not the solution.</p>
<p>And we need to have ways of teaching people how to actually manage it. It&rsquo;s not that hard and the</p>
<p>basics can be taught very simply, but right now we are massively exacerbating this wealth gap,</p>
<p>the way that we behave. And then all of this money that&rsquo;s going to go in, this 1.9 trillion,</p>
<p>whatever, how many trillion comes afterwards is frankly, for the few that are smart enough to</p>
<p>take advantage of it will be amazing, but it&rsquo;ll still push the overwhelming majority of Americans</p>
<p>who are stuck in labor deeper and deeper into that ghetto and they&rsquo;ll never get up.</p>
<p>It is definitely every little bit helps, right? Like if you have the 401k that helps</p>
<p>and then educate people. And I think if we gave everybody an ISA at birth or an income sharing</p>
<p>agreement for these 20 professions and the government provided those.</p>
<p>Jason, why is it that, you know, for example, if to invest in a startup,</p>
<p>you either have to have more than $5 million or more than, you know, a million bucks.</p>
<p>200k a year, it&rsquo;s bonkers and they&rsquo;re going to have to change it.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re a product manager, that&rsquo;s like really, really talented, or if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, somebody else who&rsquo;s just got a, you know, a PhD in nuclear biology and frankly,</p>
<p>is, you know, is decided to teach for 60,000 and you can&rsquo;t participate,</p>
<p>even though you have the intellect to judge. Like, we&rsquo;re just like, kind of like compounding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse than that. The person who&rsquo;s changing the accreditation laws at the SEC</p>
<p>and working on this said, I cannot, I&rsquo;m writing the accreditation laws.</p>
<p>And because I make 150k a year, whatever it is under 200k,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t participate. And I&rsquo;m the one responsible for the law.</p>
<p>That person must be one of the most sophisticated people in the world.</p>
<p>It literally is the most sophisticated person in the world when it comes to accreditation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to move to sophisticated investor, not accredited,</p>
<p>and just some test. And if you did that, every single Uber driver,</p>
<p>Lyft driver, Postmates driver, Airbnb host, or a person who used the cash app or PayPal</p>
<p>would have said, I can, as one of the first users, I have access to buy shares.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to say this. I&rsquo;ll buy them.</p>
<p>This problem has to get fixed, because I think in the next 10, I think in the next 10 and 20 years,</p>
<p>the United States is going to fucking reemerge like a phoenix. And the reason the reason is</p>
<p>because of innovation around climate change and agriculture and biotechnology and technology.</p>
<p>These four areas are going to recast GDP. But what that also means is that if we&rsquo;re going to create</p>
<p>20 or $30 trillion a year for the next 10 and 20 years, 300, 500 trillion,</p>
<p>how the fuck do we make sure that more than 18 people participate?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, so I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying. But I can tell you,</p>
<p>every single one of the companies that I&rsquo;ve invested in are looking to hire people right now,</p>
<p>they cannot hire people soon enough. It&rsquo;s their biggest challenge. And it&rsquo;s not just coders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s salespeople, it&rsquo;s marketing people, it&rsquo;s HR people, it&rsquo;s every role in their company,</p>
<p>they have trouble trying to hire the right person. And they give options to all those people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a small number of founders getting equity. This is basically a new category</p>
<p>of call it entrepreneurial labor. It&rsquo;s labor who gets ownership in the company that&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>existed before. And really, what this comes down to is we need more people participating in the new</p>
<p>economy. If you participate in the new economy, then you get ownership. And if you&rsquo;re in the old</p>
<p>economy, then you really are stuck in labor. And so what we need to do is spread the opportunity</p>
<p>that that technology represents to more people. That&rsquo;s part of the minimum wage,</p>
<p>maybe we should have a minimum equity participation. So we have the minimum</p>
<p>wage over here. But if you&rsquo;re working for an entrepreneurial enterprise, why not get a minimum,</p>
<p>you know, participation in equity, because the free market takes care of that. I mean,</p>
<p>if you have the right market hasn&rsquo;t taken care of it, David, the free market has,</p>
<p>I agree with David, the free market has, the problem is, how does a person working at Walmart</p>
<p>ever participated in the Walmart appreciation? That&rsquo;s the point, they will, they will leave</p>
<p>and go to a company that gives them equity. And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll see this. That&rsquo;s convenient to</p>
<p>say, but they got a job within an hour of their house, it&rsquo;s not, they got to have the</p>
<p>right skills, Jason. And so this all comes back to education. You know, we got to we got to</p>
<p>people who are in rank and file jobs, the 30 million truck drivers, cashiers, etc,</p>
<p>have equity participation as a right, I think I think you&rsquo;re saying something different.</p>
<p>Should they? Absolutely. Should the company that does that be created? Absolutely. Will they be</p>
<p>rewarded with all the people that want to work there? Absolutely. So now somebody should go</p>
<p>and start that fucking company. Okay. I just think it&rsquo;s an interesting concept. I mean,</p>
<p>we do have a minimum wage, why not have a minimum? Jason, you know, the same woman that ran</p>
<p>Elon out of California, Lorena Gonzalez, she&rsquo;s doing another thing now, just propose a new bill,</p>
<p>like, do you want her to basically pick the equity thresholds? Because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Well, no, let&rsquo;s pivot. Let&rsquo;s pivot to California. Okay, let&rsquo;s pivot to another disaster.</p>
<p>So the recall is well on its way, they need to get 1.5 million signatures, we&rsquo;re at 1.1 or 1.2.</p>
<p>But we actually really need to because there&rsquo;s some verification process that goes on. So in</p>
<p>all likelihood, we will see Gavin Newsom recalled. We agree on that. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you this,</p>
<p>the stats I heard, there&rsquo;s about a million, call it a million, million one signatures,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve seen about an 85% verification rate to date. Saks, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong on this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting about 200,000 signatures a week. They&rsquo;re, you know, the cost for marketing and</p>
<p>attracting people to get these signatures is coming in at like three to six bucks a signature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really not a lot of money is needing to be spent to get this done.</p>
<p>And, you know, even if the verification rate drops to 75 or 65%, you&rsquo;re still on track at this rate</p>
<p>to hit the recall target by March 17, which is the deadline. And so it appears highly likely</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to get there. Saks, am I right on all that? Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re at 1.2 million</p>
<p>signatures. That&rsquo;s what I heard. And they&rsquo;re trying to get they&rsquo;re trying to get to 2 million</p>
<p>to have a buffer so that you know, they that you know, they don&rsquo;t get pushed under the but 1.5 is</p>
<p>the number they need. Yeah, they need 1.5 million certified signatures.</p>
<p>70% of the way there according to the website recall Gavin 2020.com, which I think</p>
<p>I think they will get there. I think they&rsquo;ll get there. And then there and then the recall</p>
<p>election would take place about four to five months after. After that, there&rsquo;s a couple of</p>
<p>months where it moves through the finance committee, the recall election has to be budgeted.</p>
<p>And then Newsom would have the opportunity to set a date within I think 60 to 80 days roughly.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re looking at July for a recall election.</p>
<p>And Saks, how do you get? How does a candidate get on the ballot because Chamath</p>
<p>is asking for a friend?</p>
<p>Wait a second, I want to be on to that candle. Should we have all four besties be on?</p>
<p>Yeah, we should we should we should all run as all four.</p>
<p>Can we can we run if we&rsquo;re gonna let the voters decide a squad, we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re probably we&rsquo;re probably gonna have four Kardashians on there. So four besties on</p>
<p>there. And what action? Yeah, so the it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s stunningly easy to be a replacement candidate,</p>
<p>we should expect there&rsquo;ll probably be about 150 replacement candidates on the ballot. Every,</p>
<p>every third tier C-list celebrity is gonna, you know, like, you know, back to Gary Coleman did it</p>
<p>like, you know, 20 years ago. Every C-list celebrity is going to do it to try and boost</p>
<p>their Q rating. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see Kathy Griffin on there. I mean, what she&rsquo;s been doing. And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a farce.</p>
<p>By the way, can we talk about why he&rsquo;s getting recalled? Because I do get this question a lot</p>
<p>from people in tech and out of tech. And I just want to highlight some of the reasons I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to hear why you guys think he&rsquo;s, you know, why there&rsquo;s this push against him.</p>
<p>But from people within the tech community, I&rsquo;ve heard that the ad hoc lockdown rules</p>
<p>have really pissed a lot of people off in terms of when businesses are allowed and not allowed</p>
<p>to be open and kind of the responsiveness and the guiding principles around this</p>
<p>during COVID. Obviously, the you know, the inability to fight against the tax rate,</p>
<p>but no one wants to be publicly saying that the failed vaccine rollout, the failed testing,</p>
<p>you know, sex, tomorrow, Jason, what do you guys think is the reason he&rsquo;s getting recalled? What</p>
<p>are the top five hypocrisy is number one, I think it&rsquo;s the hypocrisy of going to those restaurants</p>
<p>and then making people not go to the beach, which is crazy. And then I think number two</p>
<p>is the virus, we&rsquo;ve only deployed 37% of our doses in California. And that makes us, you know,</p>
<p>of the major states that are putting out a lot of these vaccines, one of the worst performers.</p>
<p>Second, yeah, we&rsquo;re in Florida, and New York are the other large states, and they&rsquo;re at 5649 and</p>
<p>50%. We&rsquo;re still stuck at 37%. California, the cradle of innovation and technology,</p>
<p>and this bum, he&rsquo;s a bum 37% deployed, we should be leading should be 70%. He&rsquo;s a bum. Can I get</p>
<p>out of here? It&rsquo;s Newsome derangement syndrome. Oh, my god. No, I&rsquo;m trying to get a viral clip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get a viral clip. You guys are besties. Jason just has a problem with anyone</p>
<p>in authority. You know, no, it&rsquo;s the hair. It&rsquo;s a problem. Jason great fucking hair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hair is too good. French laundry, the hypocrisy and then get to work. So personality,</p>
<p>personality for you is the biggest driver. Is that right, Jason?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s literally the performance of their Washington, DC, West Virginia, North Dakota,</p>
<p>South Dakota, all 66 to 73% of their vaccines are both their double us. Now it&rsquo;s smaller states,</p>
<p>but still, we&rsquo;re goddamn California. Here&rsquo;s what I would say as a list.</p>
<p>Number one, we&rsquo;re the most heavily taxed. Number two, we are we have some of the worst</p>
<p>infrastructure in the country. We have some of the lowest and poorest performing schools</p>
<p>in the country. We have the highest homeless rates for veterans in the country. We have the</p>
<p>worst preparedness for climate in the country. And so it&rsquo;s basically just a complete bungling</p>
<p>at every level. And so and then the fourth or the last, which is the biggest one is we have now</p>
<p>created an inhospitable culture for innovation. And the biggest problem with that is if these</p>
<p>climate jobs and these technology jobs and these biotechnology jobs pivot to more accepting and</p>
<p>progressive local and state managements, like Austin, Texas and Miami, Florida,</p>
<p>we lose these things forever. This is a multi-generational decay that we&rsquo;re starting.</p>
<p>And so if we care about the state, I love California. I love San Francisco. I love</p>
<p>how eclectic and unique and different it is. I was always happy to pay 10, 11, 12, 13, 14%</p>
<p>because it was worth it. Now, I don&rsquo;t know what we get for it. And so I think we I think I think</p>
<p>he should get recalled. I just think he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s trash. And just to underscore the point on</p>
<p>lockdowns, we now have certainly more cases, we have more deaths, and we have more deaths per</p>
<p>capita than Florida, despite the fact that Florida has no lockdowns and a much older population.</p>
<p>And so I was just in Florida a few weeks ago, like, you know, like Jamal was saying, you know,</p>
<p>Suarez, the mayor there has created a really a land of the free. I mean, it&rsquo;s really unbelievable.</p>
<p>You can go to bars, you can go to restaurants, there&rsquo;s no lockdown whatsoever.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have as big a problem as California does right now.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Because, well, because I think that the lockdowns-</p>
<p>On a scientific basis, yeah.</p>
<p>I think the lockdowns only forestalled the problem. Eventually, the virus finds a way around</p>
<p>them. And I also think the thing that&rsquo;s happening in Florida is that, okay, so my aunt lives there,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in her 70s. She&rsquo;s not going to bars and restaurants because she knows she&rsquo;s highly at</p>
<p>risk. And so just because the government doesn&rsquo;t lock down, doesn&rsquo;t mean that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take sensible precautions on their own. And so I think that what&rsquo;s happened is that people are</p>
<p>going out to bars and restaurants are low risk, and they&rsquo;re keeping the economy going over there.</p>
<p>And instead, in California, we have this very draconian lockdown policy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s put all these small businesses out of work.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s worse. It&rsquo;s not a draconian lockdown policy. It&rsquo;s a whipsaw.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s open. Okay, great. Now go and invest in a bunch of CapEx to make sure there&rsquo;s outdoor</p>
<p>dining. Oh, hold on, you&rsquo;re closed. What is that? That&rsquo;s just stupid. It&rsquo;s incompetent.</p>
<p>Tons of restaurant bar owners in San Francisco spent on average $30,000</p>
<p>building outdoor seating for their facility, only to have it all shut down three and a half</p>
<p>weeks later. Incompetent. It&rsquo;s fucking incompetent.</p>
<p>I mean, can you imagine being an owner of that business? What the experience must have been like?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s unfair. No, I mean, you would literally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to kill themselves. This is the tragedy of it. People will lose everything,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be suicides, depression, domestic violence, drug use.</p>
<p>And then this guy&rsquo;s having dinner at French Laundry during the whole, I mean, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>such a bad look. I just got a note.</p>
<p>What a bad look. He&rsquo;s actually been banished from being at</p>
<p>the French Laundry. Apparently, it&rsquo;s been renamed the Sri Lankan Laundry, and some notable Sri</p>
<p>Lankan billionaire has bought the French Laundry. French Laundry, by the way, they got a $2.6</p>
<p>million PPP loan that got forgiven. So there&rsquo;s a lot of heat on the French Laundry as a whole.</p>
<p>What does it cost to go to French Laundry? $800 a person?</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s listening to this, who wants to go to the French Laundry,</p>
<p>stay at home, pour a bunch of salt on whatever you&rsquo;re going to eat.</p>
<p>Melt a stick of butter in the microwave.</p>
<p>Melt a stick of butter in the microwave, drink it, and then basically take $1,500,</p>
<p>light it on fire, you&rsquo;ve been to the French Laundry. You&rsquo;re welcome. Here&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>Take a really great steak.</p>
<p>Trash.</p>
<p>And then cut it into a cube and throw out 80% of it.</p>
<p>That place is trash.</p>
<p>And then put the cube in the middle of a big, large plate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even nouveau riche. It&rsquo;s just nouveau stupid.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>I got trash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people are down in Texas getting a brisket burrito for $4.</p>
<p>But I think California really needs to fix this. We need to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I just want to ask one more question of you guys. You don&rsquo;t think that this</p>
<p>because I was having this debate with my family about Newsome,</p>
<p>and I was telling them about the perspectives I was hearing from tech people,</p>
<p>and why everyone&rsquo;s so against Newsome.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard all these different things that you guys have shared today.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very&hellip; And I&rsquo;m hearing a lot of people making the counterpoint like,</p>
<p>this is a very difficult time. It&rsquo;s been an impossible year for everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>So first of all, Newsome was dealt a pretty difficult hand to play.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we are all psychologically primed</p>
<p>to look for grass being greener on the other side. I think a big part of&hellip;</p>
<p>Certainly, there&rsquo;s a lot of people leaving California, my belief, for Texas and Florida,</p>
<p>primarily because of taxes. And then you justify it with all the things that are wrong with</p>
<p>California. But we&rsquo;re all really primed right now with this notion that it&rsquo;s a difficult place to be.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also really having a shitty year. We&rsquo;ve had this pandemic, businesses have been shut,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s sick, the economy&rsquo;s having issues. There&rsquo;s a really difficult hand that&rsquo;s been dealt.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t buy that as an excuse for Newsome. I mean, look, it is true that we&rsquo;re going through a</p>
<p>very difficult time. But the reason I don&rsquo;t buy that as an excuse for Newsome is because</p>
<p>this is not April or May of 2020, when we thought the fatality rate was 7%.</p>
<p>And lockdowns could be justified then. But we now have so much more data. We&rsquo;ve seen that</p>
<p>states that did not do lockdowns, like Florida and Texas, frankly, have been no worse off</p>
<p>than those that have done very severe lockdowns. And so what is the point of continuing with this</p>
<p>facade? And that is what I think we can legitimately blame Newsome for is the failure to</p>
<p>learn and to change course based on data to adapt. And where is the daily press briefing on what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening? I think&hellip; And by the way, most of the spread is not happening at businesses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening in homes. And in California, we have a particularly difficult problem</p>
<p>because of multi generational family homes, especially in the Latino communities that have</p>
<p>been hardest hit by COVID. And the transmission rate&hellip; They also happen to skew with diabetes</p>
<p>as well. Yeah, the transmission rate in those communities is three to five x what it is</p>
<p>elsewhere. And I think, you know, and that is not a result of businesses being open. In fact,</p>
<p>those communities are also suffering the biggest hardships because businesses are closed.</p>
<p>Well, by the way, this goes to the vaccination strategy just being so idiotic. Like,</p>
<p>you know, if you want it to be equitable, then why weren&rsquo;t we just rolling through</p>
<p>and basically getting those families to be vaccinated first independent of age? You know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you know, all these vaccination sites, nobody shows up.</p>
<p>I spoke to SFDPH, Department of Public Health about this last week, and they told me that</p>
<p>they cannot get those communities, they&rsquo;re very non trusting of the vaccine. And they&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>a real struggle getting people to sign up to take the vaccine. The problem is, even if that is the</p>
<p>case, the problem is you should not be holding up vaccines for one community and get everybody</p>
<p>else vaccinated. So they never said you cut the head off this fucking transmission.</p>
<p>Over 60 gets it. That&rsquo;s it. There&rsquo;s nothing to discuss. Let&rsquo;s wrap up everyone, everyone gets</p>
<p>it. But you allocate a certain number of doses to you basically have like a TSA pre check line.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re over 60, or you&rsquo;re in certain communities, you jump to the front of the line. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it. But everyone can stand in line and put fucking shots in arms because everyone I know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s over 65 can&rsquo;t even get an appointment. And it&rsquo;s bullshit. And the whole thing is incompetence.</p>
<p>So I think what I think what SAC said is so right. It&rsquo;s like in these moments, J. Cal,</p>
<p>and Friedberg, like a light gets shone on the ability for people to figure things out. And</p>
<p>then you know what the intellectual capability of these people are. And like, look, we saw the</p>
<p>intellectual incapability of Trump. Because we all adapt, this guy could not adapt. Okay. And,</p>
<p>and so we are now seeing the intellectual incapability of Gavin Newsom. And I just think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re part of the same lot. They&rsquo;re just kind of, you know, people who are in over their head.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re beholden to people who got them there. And their number one concern is staying in office,</p>
<p>which means appeasing a bunch of special interests. Speaking of special interest,</p>
<p>David Sachs is still on tilt about conservatives being cancelled. David, you wanted us to wrap with</p>
<p>this Wilkinson cancellation. So every podcast, we&rsquo;re going to have a right winger who&rsquo;s cancelled</p>
<p>and David&rsquo;s justification for putting them back on the platform. Go ahead, David.</p>
<p>Well, actually, so yeah, this is this is this is the issue.</p>
<p>The week with David.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s well, this is actually it&rsquo;s not a it&rsquo;s not a left wing it. So this is the issue</p>
<p>du jour on social media right now is that a writer named Will Wilkinson was just fired from his job</p>
<p>and cancelled. But here&rsquo;s the thing. It was he&rsquo;s not a conservative. He&rsquo;s actually a liberal.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>And it was a yes. And it was a right wing tweet mob that got together to get him fired.</p>
<p>Yes. And so</p>
<p>how did you get this mob together to get him cancelled?</p>
<p>Explain.</p>
<p>Yeah. So</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back, everybody. So much for the wives dinner.</p>
<p>My God. Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need another wives dinner.</p>
<p>Well, no, look, I feel the need to speak out on this because I got to make it really clear</p>
<p>that I do not support cancel culture when perpetrated by the right against the left.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>What did he do?</p>
<p>OK, so he posted a tweet making a joke that maybe was in poor taste, not that funny,</p>
<p>basically saying that if we want unity, the one thing that like the Trumpers and the</p>
<p>Biden supporters can agree on is hanging pence. You know, it&rsquo;s what is hanging,</p>
<p>lynching, lynching, lynching, lynching or hanging. He said he said hang. I think.</p>
<p>No, I think he said hang.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s in poor taste and it&rsquo;s inciting violence on the march. Go ahead, Saks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in poor taste.</p>
<p>Well, no, look, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a joke that&rsquo;s not actually that funny and</p>
<p>maybe in poor taste. What he&rsquo;s referring to is the fact that the you know, that there were people</p>
<p>on January six who were going after Mike Pence. Right. That was sort of the joke.</p>
<p>Anyway, look, he that&rsquo;s not the point. He deleted it. He apologized for it. His boss</p>
<p>is still fired him for it. Nobody believes that he was trying to incite violence.</p>
<p>OK, I mean, come on. We all know that was not inciting violence, but but the mob pretended</p>
<p>that he was in order to create its phony outrage. And then his bosses have to pretend that he was</p>
<p>in order to appease the mob. And they pretend like it was incitement to violence so they can fire him.</p>
<p>And then he even had to pretend that he was inciting violence because he had to then</p>
<p>abjectly apologize for it. And there&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s the thing about cancel culture. I really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s just so fake and phony. We all have to pretend and things that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>true in order to pacify some tweet mob whose outrage is manufactured anyway.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like seeing the right doing this. And that&rsquo;s what I tweeted about. And then we</p>
<p>had all these people on the right responding to me saying an eye for an eye. You know,</p>
<p>the left deserves this, too. Now they&rsquo;re going to get a taste of their own medicine.</p>
<p>And the problem with that is, look, you know, you&rsquo;re you might win this particular battle,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re losing the war because you&rsquo;re now buying into the premise of cancel culture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now buying into this idea that we need to economically cancel people who disagree with us.</p>
<p>And I really reject that. It&rsquo;s certainly bad timing to say,</p>
<p>lynch or hang, whichever word he used, obviously, lynching is a much worse word.</p>
<p>After people were chanting, hang Mike Pence, but he was making a commentary on that.</p>
<p>The joke didn&rsquo;t land. And when the joke doesn&rsquo;t land, you need to just take ownership of that</p>
<p>and say that you shouldn&rsquo;t be canceled. You just say it was a poor attempt at humor. I apologize.</p>
<p>Right. And Jason, you know better than anybody else when a joke doesn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, here&rsquo;s one thing to learn about comedy. People don&rsquo;t remember the jokes</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t land. They remember the ones that land. Okay, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like investing in startups. It&rsquo;s like you got a lot of losers to find the few winners.</p>
<p>Absolutely. That&rsquo;s my I&rsquo;m a volume guy. You know, that Governor Chamath dot com,</p>
<p>Governor Sachs dot com, Governor Freeberg dot com, and Governor Jason dot com.</p>
<p>Can I just say, Jason, Jason, if Newsom is recalled, I would like to put my name on the</p>
<p>ballot. And my commitments are quite simple. I just want to I&rsquo;m going to cut the taxes to zero.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to basically create an incredibly pro climate change</p>
<p>jobs and pro tech jobs and pro biotech jobs economy. And I&rsquo;m going to raise teacher salaries</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to give everybody a school voucher. Okay, we have maybe, maybe on the next episode,</p>
<p>we can all declare that we&rsquo;re running for governor and present our platform.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s do that. Let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. Go to Governor Chamath dot com, Governor Sachs dot com,</p>
<p>Governor Freeberg dot com, Governor Jason dot com.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your B?</p>
