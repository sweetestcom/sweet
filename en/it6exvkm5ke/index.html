<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back to the show everyone we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here with another q a talking about keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting nutrition anything</p>
<p>that I say is not meant to</p>
<p>provide any preventative or cures or</p>
<p>anything to even get close to curing</p>
<p>anything check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of these suggestions</p>
<p>all the information I&rsquo;m going to share</p>
<p>with you are in videos that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>scientific</p>
<p>uh studies to back up what I said you</p>
<p>could research that yourself and look</p>
<p>those up uh but let&rsquo;s just Dive Right In</p>
<p>Steve and uh I know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>questions and I just like to get us</p>
<p>through as many as we can absolutely so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s equal love to everyone both on</p>
<p>social media in our green room and and</p>
<p>so on so let&rsquo;s start off with social</p>
<p>media this morning Ricky from YouTube</p>
<p>could you please do a video on the</p>
<p>benefits of using mustard oil many</p>
<p>people in South Asia are using uh to</p>
<p>improve their health what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on good old mustard oil doc</p>
<p>well the person becomes the mind it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for cramps at night nocturnal</p>
<p>cramps where your your calves are</p>
<p>cramping your feet are cramping your</p>
<p>legs are cramping mustard seems to work</p>
<p>good but mustard is part of the</p>
<p>cruciferous family so it has a lot of</p>

<p>this is not medical advice so but look</p>
<p>at all the people who&rsquo;ve lost tons of</p>
<p>weight and feel great so that&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>enough for something good is going on</p>
<p>here all right why don&rsquo;t we go to the</p>
<p>green room and we&rsquo;ve got a nice young</p>
<p>lady</p>
<p>from from the UK in the northeast of the</p>
<p>country as so Gil if you would oh wait a</p>
<p>minute I think oh no her thing might be</p>
<p>frozen go ahead Gail let&rsquo;s give you a</p>
<p>try unmute yourself and say hello to Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>hi Dr Luke hello</p>
<p>hi hi</p>
<p>go ahead with your one question Gil</p>
<p>okay my question is um about chronic</p>
<p>fatigue syndrome Ma</p>
<p>I was off suffered with this condition</p>
<p>for two years</p>
<p>I was um and I feel like when I eat</p>
<p>carbs that it it&rsquo;s it really impacts on</p>
<p>my energy levels</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been starting to look at your</p>
<p>videos and about intimate intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and keto</p>
<p>um and I just wondered what you thought</p>
<p>about that sort of diet for my condition</p>
<p>well girl I I had that exact same</p>
<p>problem in my 20s so I know exactly how</p>
<p>you feel I was so exhausted I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what was going on uh the first</p>
<p>thing I will mention because this is in</p>
<p>a lot of my videos is that</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s a thing called um stress that</p>
<p>a lot of people are under that can</p>
<p>activate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called latent viruses like</p>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus and other viruses and</p>
<p>that could be one reason for</p>
<p>fatigue uh chronic fatigue it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a reactivation of these this virus that</p>
<p>tends to go dormant and pop out when you</p>
<p>go through stress because when you go</p>
<p>through stress your immune system is</p>
<p>kind of paralyzed so there&rsquo;s no defenses</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one thing and if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem you need to do whatever you can</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>resolve that chronic stress that</p>
<p>situation it could be a you know</p>
<p>anything connected to some suppressor uh</p>
<p>stressful person or whatever but that</p>
<p>being said</p>
<p>the energy is produced in a little</p>
<p>um part of your cell called the</p>
<p>mitochondria it&rsquo;s an energy Factory</p>
<p>and um in order to get energy out of</p>
<p>that cell we need to convert food into</p>
<p>audience we froze our host is Frozen for</p>
<p>just a moment let&rsquo;s give them a chance</p>
<p>to come by</p>
<p>B1 vitamin B1</p>
<p>so thymine so if a person is not on keto</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>too many carbs</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to overwhelm that</p>
<p>spark plug in other words</p>
<p>your vitamin B1 is needed in very high</p>
<p>amounts depending on how much</p>
<p>carbohydrate you have so a lot of times</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have enough B1 you won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to burn that that glucose sugar</p>
<p>fuel so if you get on keto what happens</p>
<p>that instantly reduces the that need for</p>
<p>B1 and you start getting energy just</p>
<p>from that alone</p>
<p>um so I would do this starting</p>
<p>immediately start at keto go to my</p>
<p>website drberg.com under video it says</p>
<p>start here watch that video shows you</p>
<p>how to do it and then get some natural</p>
<p>B1</p>
<p>and then together I think both of those</p>
<p>things will pull you right out of that</p>
<p>chronic fatigue unless there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>Viral thing going on in the background</p>
<p>which you can also address with handling</p>
<p>your stress</p>
<p>all right Gail well listen thank you so</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>for joining us I think she&rsquo;s Frozen a</p>
<p>little bit thank you so much there she</p>
<p>goes all right get back with us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and let us know how all</p>
<p>that works out all right why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>to another area that&rsquo;s so popular the</p>
<p>program and that is your fabulous quiz</p>
<p>questions there&rsquo;s the first one for</p>
<p>today</p>
<p>okay what material are those uh floaters</p>
<p>in your eye made out of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few be interested to hear</p>
<p>that answer okay let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media VM from the UK on YouTube my blood</p>
<p>sugars are so high in the morning I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>strictly keto and carnivore no carbs at</p>
<p>all why should this be and should I be</p>
<p>worried</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>one of the best tests to determine</p>
<p>in insulin deficiency</p>
<p>is fasting blood glucose which is you</p>
<p>just slept all night and also it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fasting you check your blood sugars it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high so this means that obviously you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough insulin so insulin is</p>
<p>not there to push the blood sugar down</p>
<p>so that usually occurs because you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance because you have a</p>
<p>history of eating a lot of carbs and now</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re still stuck with this insulin</p>
<p>resistance now it could also be a</p>
<p>combination of your pancreas</p>
<p>getting really really tired and</p>
<p>exhausted to the point where it just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t produce</p>
<p>enough of this insulin right now and</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s another thing that happens</p>
<p>so what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p>rejuvenate</p>
<p>um the pancreas</p>
<p>as well as fixed insulin resistance so</p>
<p>stay in car stand Keto</p>
<p>keep doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and also add exercise more exercise will</p>
<p>instantly improve that situation burn up</p>
<p>some of that extra sugar</p>
<p>uh apple cider vinegar with water is</p>
<p>essential</p>
<p>berberine is one of the best herbs</p>
<p>almost equivalent to metformin that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just my opinion by the way</p>
<p>um cinnamon a little cinnamon on your</p>
<p>toast with sugar I&rsquo;m being very</p>
<p>sarcastic just use the cinnamon in other</p>
<p>ways or maybe just take it as a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>vitamin D either from the Sun or a</p>
<p>supplement these are all things that are</p>
<p>are going to speed things up for you and</p>
<p>turn this around pretty quick so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening wonderful go for it</p>
<p>okay this is a good question I think Len</p>
<p>from Facebook what kind of water filter</p>
<p>do you use in your home to get rid of</p>
<p>chlorine and other materials in our</p>
<p>water supply</p>
<p>you know um</p>
<p>in The Farmhouse I&rsquo;m living in I have no</p>
<p>filter well I have just a sediment</p>
<p>filter because the water comes from a</p>
<p>spring but</p>
<p>um when I lived in the other house</p>
<p>definitely had um two filters one that</p>
<p>pulled out chlorine and all the other</p>
<p>garbage but unfortunately a lot of these</p>
<p>filters</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t also at the same time get rid</p>
<p>of the fluorine so I had to get two</p>
<p>filters one for the specific for the</p>
<p>fluorine and the other one for</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>um I did a video on this if you look</p>
<p>um look up my videos on that you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>it but I don&rsquo;t remember the company that</p>
<p>I that I use for those filters so you</p>
<p>can look that up but you want to get one</p>
<p>for chloride and fluoride and of course</p>
<p>the other ones as well all right very</p>
<p>good and a quick reminder everyone you</p>
<p>can get a very organized version of a</p>
<p>great app on both Android and</p>
<p>um Mac to be able to research that at</p>
<p>your fingertips okay we have an answer</p>
<p>for our first quiz question of the day</p>
<p>and the quiz question asks what are</p>
<p>those material what material are those</p>
<p>floaters in your eyes made out of what</p>
<p>yucky stuff is that and 58 of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s some form of sugar</p>
<p>or other carbs 22 say it&rsquo;s proteins ten</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s cholesterol and 10 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s collagen</p>
<p>anybody on to something you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it&rsquo;s a combination of both</p>
<p>of those answers It&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>sugar and protein and so the material is</p>
<p>basically called glycation</p>
<p>end products it&rsquo;s like a glycated which</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s basically a combination of</p>
<p>the sugar and the protein stuck together</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all that it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>vitreous gel in the eye is collagen and</p>
<p>when it gets stuck to Sugar it it makes</p>
<p>these little floaters and so really</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re um or glycated proteins</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to create a video and</p>
<p>release it to show you how to get rid of</p>
<p>those floaters once the problem because</p>
<p>they can be very irritating but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not just randomly they don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>randomly come from anything there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re glycated proteins and so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s exactly what you also see in</p>
<p>diabetes so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>to get on ketos to reduce the sugar</p>
<p>because it starts to create this</p>
<p>glycation not just in your eyes but on</p>
<p>your nerves and your brain in the</p>
<p>arteries in the red blood cells all over</p>
<p>the place All Right audience watch out</p>
<p>for that I don&rsquo;t know what I did wrong I</p>
<p>have had those in the past and they</p>
<p>eventually I just ignore them but uh</p>
<p>maybe yeah you get used to them yeah</p>
<p>also fasting is really good for them as</p>
<p>well interesting all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see we talked to her uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Neil Francis from YouTube please share</p>
<p>your advice for eradicating kidney</p>
<p>stones naturally is there such a thing</p>
<p>there is such a thing um the first thing</p>
<p>you want to do to prevent a kidney stone</p>
<p>from forming is to keep the urine very</p>
<p>diluted so it doesn&rsquo;t form a super</p>
<p>concentrated</p>
<p>you know usually it&rsquo;s a calcium</p>
<p>oxalate Stones so you want to drink</p>
<p>um minimally two and a half liters of</p>
<p>fluid a day okay so that&rsquo;s like very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>um and then we want to</p>
<p>um beef up no pun intended in your</p>
<p>citrates with lemon water or a lemon a</p>
<p>day that will help because that citrate</p>
<p>tends to prevent The Binding of the</p>
<p>calcium and the oxalates so um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing you can do you can also</p>
<p>take certain supplements like potassium</p>
<p>citrate or magnesium citrate</p>
<p>you want to make sure that if you get</p>
<p>that an electrolyte powder it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>also come with the maltodextrin which is</p>
<p>in all the different products that they</p>
<p>put out there get a quality one a couple</p>
<p>other things you can do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>avoid certain foods high in oxalates</p>
<p>like spinach almonds chocolate kiwis</p>
<p>um and if you happen to eat some spinach</p>
<p>for example or almonds also at the same</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>consume some cheese because that calcium</p>
<p>that you have with it like if you let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>cheese with spinach like Feta cheese or</p>
<p>they have different cheeses that calcium</p>
<p>will bind with the oxalate and it will</p>
<p>prevent it from being reabsorbed and go</p>
<p>through the kidney</p>
<p>creating that oxalate problem so those</p>
<p>are just some simple tips but I have a</p>
<p>lot of videos on kidney stones and it</p>
<p>could be totally preventative if you</p>
<p>happen to have a kidney stone I also</p>
<p>show you how to do like massage to help</p>
<p>maybe push it out because</p>
<p>it can be slightly painful at times</p>
<p>oh very good isn&rsquo;t uh one I&rsquo;m curious</p>
<p>your answer Albert from YouTube Dr Berg</p>
<p>how do I raise my HDL and LDL</p>
<p>um I hope that&rsquo;s right Terry I&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>low carb diet for the last six months</p>
<p>and have lost a lot of weight and feel</p>
<p>much better but my libido is down and my</p>
<p>triglycerides are in the normal range</p>
<p>does that make any sense Todd</p>
<p>triglycerides are in a normal range or</p>
<p>abnormal range uh well it says normal</p>
<p>range so I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to make</p>
<p>of that question is there any case where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to raise LDL and HDL</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a way to phrase that yeah</p>
<p>well one of the best things to do is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re on a low carb</p>
<p>diet but the other thing you have to</p>
<p>make sure of is you want to make sure</p>
<p>that the quality of those foods are are</p>
<p>healthy you know we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>the dirty keto see if you see keto is</p>
<p>just low carb right so that&rsquo;s I mean</p>
<p>okay so then what can you do unlimited</p>
<p>fat unlimited MCT oil Unlimited</p>
<p>grease like no no of course not you want</p>
<p>to do like um</p>
<p>like I say um a lot of salads that fiber</p>
<p>will help bind some of the cholesterol</p>
<p>you also want to work on um the quality</p>
<p>of meat so you have the nutrition so you</p>
<p>actually end up feeling good on the keto</p>
<p>now as far as testosterone goes so many</p>
<p>people when they get on keto improve</p>
<p>their testosterone so I suspect there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re either missing or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing right with that I would</p>
<p>go to my website and and look look at</p>
<p>that because we might need to add some</p>
<p>more zinc for example to increase your</p>
<p>testosterone this is why I recommend</p>
<p>certain supplements while you&rsquo;re on keto</p>
<p>like uh electrolytes B vitamins trace</p>
<p>minerals so that should help you but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to release a video if I I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve released this video but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s certain indications</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not doing keto right one is</p>
<p>fatigue one is like feeling worse like</p>
<p>and I go through each scenario so you</p>
<p>should stay tuned for that video I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty sure I did not release that yet</p>
<p>but I I will</p>
<p>um so those are just some quick things</p>
<p>to just to think about well I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how on Earth you remember which ones</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done and happened I guess you got</p>
<p>to research it like everybody else</p>
<p>anyway these are from Facebook how can I</p>
<p>address and prevent heart palpitations</p>
<p>usually if you have the right amount of</p>
<p>electrolytes like magnesium potassium</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll get rid of</p>
<p>electrolytes also I mean palpations I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry if you also have um</p>
<p>pH problem if your pH goes too far one</p>
<p>way or the other you can develop</p>
<p>palpitations too so let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you start taking a lot of</p>
<p>um and acids right and you start</p>
<p>throwing off the stomach acid now your</p>
<p>absorption of electrolytes are could be</p>
<p>off or let&rsquo;s say you have you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>diuretic and that&rsquo;s sucking out all your</p>
<p>potassium then you can develop you know</p>
<p>palpitations</p>
<p>um I had some pretty bad palpitations</p>
<p>once and uh I was eating really good and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where it was coming from</p>
<p>and then I started looking at EMF um I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I have my unit right here</p>
<p>but electromagnetic fields and I checked</p>
<p>my entire house and I found where they</p>
<p>were they&rsquo;re on the um the wall right in</p>
<p>the back of my bed</p>
<p>uh right behind the headboard and I</p>
<p>found very high levels of what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>magnetic fields that extended eight feet</p>
<p>from the wall</p>
<p>so apparently in that wall there was all</p>
<p>these Crossing of wires that I was</p>
<p>literally being bathed in these uh in a</p>
<p>magnet</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I had electrician come over open up the</p>
<p>wall fix everything</p>
<p>never had those palpitations again I</p>
<p>even went so far as I I got a</p>
<p>cardiologist to send me</p>
<p>um one of those um</p>
<p>uh what do you call them they all kind</p>
<p>of like a remote uh testing device that</p>
<p>they checked your heart with it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>halter halter monitor kg or something</p>
<p>and uh did you know it was less than</p>
<p>five percent so apparently wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>problem but I felt it but after that</p>
<p>getting you know really watching out</p>
<p>these emfs so it handled my palpitations</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I think I think the advantage</p>
<p>for everyone watching is um</p>
<p>have a library of information on health</p>
<p>that pretty much</p>
<p>I had every single problem almost every</p>
<p>single problem that everyone had so I I</p>
<p>can relate to it so I do videos on that</p>
<p>indeed okay uh demo Duo is the handle</p>
<p>for this person from YouTube Every time</p>
<p>I take D3 vitamin C and Zinc I get a</p>
<p>rash around my eyes when I stop taking</p>
<p>them the rash clears up any thoughts on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with a demo dude first</p>
<p>thing I would wonder is I&rsquo;d like to know</p>
<p>what the quality of those nutrients are</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re taking for example</p>
<p>your vitamin C but it&rsquo;s really just</p>
<p>ascorbic acid which they make from</p>
<p>sulfuric acid and cornstarch</p>
<p>that could be why because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reacting to Something in those</p>
<p>ingredients so I would I would suspect</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something either as a binder or</p>
<p>something into the supplements one dirty</p>
<p>little secret that uh a lot of vitamin</p>
<p>companies</p>
<p>um are using is very low level</p>
<p>ingredients and</p>
<p>um hidden maltodextrin and all sorts of</p>
<p>stuff</p>
<p>um especially from these brand names</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really know who&rsquo;s behind</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s just a brand but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know the quality you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the person who designs it this is one of</p>
<p>the reasons why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to grow our own</p>
<p>ingredients for our supplements so that</p>
<p>way everyone can actually see or even</p>
<p>come to the farm and actually visualize</p>
<p>you know that here it is right here so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very uh interesting topic but</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll stop right there Steve all</p>
<p>right well let&rsquo;s uh stop there and start</p>
<p>with question number two for the day and</p>
<p>there it is</p>
<p>all right true or false the alkaline</p>
<p>water generated from alkaline water</p>
<p>machines can make your body more</p>
<p>alkaline</p>
<p>huh tongue twister true or false all</p>
<p>right folks okay let&rsquo;s see Brittany from</p>
<p>Facebook I have neuropathy are there any</p>
<p>supplements that she can take to help</p>
<p>with the pain she&rsquo;s experiencing</p>
<p>yeah I the thing that comes to mind</p>
<p>right off the bat is the benfotamine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it is synthetic but it seems to</p>
<p>be one of the only synthetic ones that I</p>
<p>do recommend it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a B1 that</p>
<p>um doesn&rsquo;t penetrate the central nervous</p>
<p>system of the brain too well but it</p>
<p>definitely penetrates the peripheral</p>
<p>nerves and your bottom of your feet and</p>
<p>your hands so if you have peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy either from diabetes or some</p>
<p>other reason well I&rsquo;ve been photamine</p>
<p>works like a charm</p>
<p>um I would take whatever it says on the</p>
<p>ingredients is take take four of those</p>
<p>and spread it to the day a lot of times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see those products with alpha</p>
<p>lipoic acid which is another great</p>
<p>remedy for that as well so the</p>
<p>combination of both of those is awesome</p>
<p>so benphotamine and alpha lipoic acid</p>
<p>all right very good uh let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>rule is the name from Facebook any</p>
<p>advice for an extremely stubborn dead</p>
<p>skin on the scalp not sure if I can call</p>
<p>it dandruff or</p>
<p>folliculitis or something</p>
<p>well it sounds to me that we do have a</p>
<p>problem with um maybe the um</p>
<p>the formation of that skin even if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have dandruff it could be like a</p>
<p>dandruff related situation because in</p>
<p>dandruff you have this overgrowth of</p>
<p>this fungus amongus and it basically</p>
<p>eats uh as its food</p>
<p>the oil from your sebaceous glands in</p>
<p>your scalp that&rsquo;s what it lives on</p>
<p>because it can&rsquo;t make its own fatty acid</p>
<p>so it eats the oil and uh so the</p>
<p>solution to that is to lower the oil</p>
<p>production and starve off that fungus by</p>
<p>increasing more zinc in your diet okay</p>
<p>or as a supplement zinc will tend to</p>
<p>help and then because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in zinc</p>
<p>um what will happen is you can start</p>
<p>developing this this flaking on the skin</p>
<p>you know it could be all sorts of</p>
<p>various dermatitis inflammation in the</p>
<p>skin or</p>
<p>um things like that but</p>
<p>the other last point I want to bring up</p>
<p>is that when you take a shower and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using tap water it&rsquo;s not filtered</p>
<p>some of that chlorine and chlorine can</p>
<p>throw off the microbes on your skin your</p>
<p>scalp and and then</p>
<p>leave the back uh the fungus unchecked</p>
<p>and then that starts to overgrow just</p>
<p>like an antibiotic you take an</p>
<p>antibiotic and then you end up with a</p>
<p>yeast infection or a Candida infection</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>because antibiotics only kill bacteria</p>
<p>not fungus</p>
<p>interesting okay the astute audience was</p>
<p>on it and has an answer for question</p>
<p>number two</p>
<p>which is a true falsehood the alkaline</p>
<p>water generated from the alkaline water</p>
<p>machines can make your body more</p>
<p>alkaline somehow that makes sense and</p>
<p>the audience 65 percent of them say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false and 35 percent say it&rsquo;s true who</p>
<p>is correct</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the people who sell these</p>
<p>machines are going to be upset but um</p>
<p>when we talk about pH</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>people think they consider like acid as</p>
<p>something really bad and really you know</p>
<p>it creates sickness you know but</p>
<p>alkaline is healthy right but um we have</p>
<p>amino acids that&rsquo;s protein you have</p>
<p>fatty acids they&rsquo;re both essential right</p>
<p>those are good you have this very</p>
<p>important stomach acid and if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have you would literally be very very</p>
<p>sick</p>
<p>the large intestine is slightly acid</p>
<p>your urine is very as acid so the</p>
<p>different parts of the body need</p>
<p>different PHS but when people are</p>
<p>talking about alkaline they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>meant talking about the blood mainly</p>
<p>which is supposed to be slightly</p>
<p>alkaline and that&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>but by drinking the alkaline water it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to change the blood in fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to eat something or take something and</p>
<p>change the blood pH</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible but it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>what you do end up changing</p>
<p>you start to dilute the stomach acid</p>
<p>with this alkaline water especially if</p>
<p>the alkalinity is too high</p>
<p>so you start changing the stomach acid</p>
<p>because some of the side effects now are</p>
<p>going to be gerd acid reflux and the</p>
<p>exact problem you&rsquo;re trying to probably</p>
<p>get rid of and you know heartburn or gas</p>
<p>these are all symptoms when you start</p>
<p>diluting your stomach acid because the</p>
<p>valve now doesn&rsquo;t close and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break down protein you can&rsquo;t get you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t kill microbes</p>
<p>so you end up with like small intestinal</p>
<p>bacterial overgrowth you get bloating</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t absorb minerals there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of problems when you start to mess with</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>um alkalizing that stomach</p>
<p>but of course some people are going to</p>
<p>say well</p>
<p>water from the spring or an Artesian</p>
<p>well is naturally alkaline so why is</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s naturally because of the</p>
<p>minerals in it what they do when they</p>
<p>alkalize the water on those machines is</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t add more minerals to it they</p>
<p>put electricity in it and they alter uh</p>
<p>the chemistry of that which is very</p>
<p>unnatural so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>but uh you&rsquo;re not going to have a</p>
<p>problem if you drink naturally mineral</p>
<p>water natural mineral water or you know</p>
<p>spring water all right very good let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to Martin who is in San Diego and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s unmuting himself and we&rsquo;ve lost him</p>
<p>a few times so I want to Dart in here</p>
<p>and put him right right now Martin go</p>
<p>ahead with your quick question for Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg so good to be on</p>
<p>here thanks for having me I&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>I love your work thanks for all your</p>
<p>service to humanity I feel like</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m a 46 I&rsquo;m going to read off this</p>
<p>script because I know I gotta get</p>
<p>through this quick 30 seconds I&rsquo;m a 46</p>
<p>year old man with the heart arrhythmia I</p>
<p>was born with sleep issues and now I</p>
<p>have a issue in my right eye I started</p>
<p>passing out uh from this heart issue at</p>
<p>age 12 and now I have a defibrillator</p>
<p>that will shock my heart if I need it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an active person I run I could run</p>
<p>three miles in 19 minutes like about a</p>
<p>year ago but I had to stop running</p>
<p>because the heart started um acting up a</p>
<p>lot um so over the last year I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>arrhythmias that needed therapy from the</p>
<p>defibrillator and I&rsquo;ve also for the last</p>
<p>10 years</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had sleep issues where I wake up at</p>
<p>3am and I know you&rsquo;ve had those issues</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>um so I can get to sleep fine like wake</p>
<p>up uh like at 3am that started about 10</p>
<p>years ago I was also diagnosed with</p>
<p>clinical depression 10 years ago I</p>
<p>started taking fish oil vitamin D and</p>
<p>some magnesium at that time for that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s of and avoiding sugar so I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that with for the clinical depression</p>
<p>but I still have the Sleep issues um and</p>
<p>I still have now I&rsquo;m having heart issues</p>
<p>after 20 years of having basically</p>
<p>asymptomatic from this it&rsquo;s called Long</p>
<p>QT syndrome so I&rsquo;ve had about five</p>
<p>shocks for my defibrillator in the last</p>
<p>five years and that was 20 years before</p>
<p>that with nothing so</p>
<p>um now I&rsquo;ve uh I&rsquo;ve been watching your</p>
<p>videos a lot over the last year I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>because I have no butt I&rsquo;m just being</p>
<p>honest and pots I think I have pots and</p>
<p>and or insulin resistance my blood</p>
<p>glucose level is about 97 on average</p>
<p>which I think probably as little high</p>
<p>for somebody like myself I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>healthy keto uh fasting for the last</p>
<p>three months um and it has helped</p>
<p>flatten my stomach for sure and a lot of</p>
<p>other things my stomach looks better</p>
<p>than ever I just want to say to people</p>
<p>out there if you&rsquo;re trying to flatten</p>
<p>your stomach by running it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to work it&rsquo;s the keto the healthy keto</p>
<p>and long walks it&rsquo;s way more effective</p>
<p>for that so anyway</p>
<p>um I tried I&rsquo;ve seen your videos on</p>
<p>trying to relax to avoid issues with</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue I&rsquo;m trying to do that</p>
<p>but I am a self-employed musician and</p>
<p>after three months of being on healthy</p>
<p>keto I&rsquo;m still only sleeping about five</p>
<p>to six hours a night and I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>sleep seven to eight like the sleep</p>
<p>experts say You&rsquo;re supposed to so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to sleep experts</p>
<p>um I know you say it can take months to</p>
<p>to heal from the insulin resistance but</p>
<p>how do I know months or years to heal</p>
<p>from the insulin resistance and or</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue but how do I know if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on the right track and also sometimes I</p>
<p>just feel really overwhelmed in is there</p>
<p>a way I can get some one-on-one help</p>
<p>with you or somebody else in your</p>
<p>Association thank you</p>
<p>okay that was thanks for that one</p>
<p>question no</p>
<p>um so um yeah there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s plenty of</p>
<p>coaches that we have uh if you call in</p>
<p>and we can uh kind of help you narrow</p>
<p>down things for sure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the um is to unpack this one quick</p>
<p>question the uh I think I would start</p>
<p>loading up uh on electrolytes in general</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to take it does take it</p>
<p>could take up to three to four to five</p>
<p>months to restore</p>
<p>um the intracellular electrolytes which</p>
<p>are potassium magnesium because those</p>
<p>are the two key ones that are involved</p>
<p>in that pacemaker so that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re correct on this</p>
<p>stress aspect but you are going to be in</p>
<p>luck because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>in practice</p>
<p>I had a device that measured the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>using a technology called heart rate</p>
<p>variability</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a wonderful uh machine because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a device that&rsquo;s very inexpensive</p>
<p>and you could literally</p>
<p>look inside someone&rsquo;s body and looking</p>
<p>you can measure how much sympathetic</p>
<p>versus how much parasympathetic versus</p>
<p>versus Your Capacity to adapt which is</p>
<p>all about that pots condition that you</p>
<p>mentioned which when you might stand up</p>
<p>and you your body can&rsquo;t adapt</p>
<p>and also it&rsquo;ll measure your intensity of</p>
<p>adapting so it&rsquo;s a really great test and</p>
<p>I am just I found</p>
<p>I found out um I recently reached out</p>
<p>and I found the person who can supply me</p>
<p>these units so you can get one you can</p>
<p>get one very soon so just you know have</p>
<p>give me about a month to</p>
<p>um get all my ducks in a row with that</p>
<p>but I want this is uh this will allow</p>
<p>people to</p>
<p>um learn more about a biofeedback tool</p>
<p>to measure uh the nervous system inside</p>
<p>and and be able to figure things out</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like hard to do a test other than go to</p>
<p>a neurologist and have them put you in a</p>
<p>table and you know which is could be</p>
<p>very expensive and very painful but this</p>
<p>is a great test to look inside to see</p>
<p>really what&rsquo;s going on and then to do</p>
<p>things to see what works and what</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um you could also need probably a lot of</p>
<p>B1 to support uh the parasympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system</p>
<p>um which is probably affecting the harm</p>
<p>but um yeah in this device all you have</p>
<p>to do is put your finger in a clip and</p>
<p>it picks up this information off of your</p>
<p>heartbeat I suspect when you go to sleep</p>
<p>at night</p>
<p>the heart rate or affects the Circadian</p>
<p>rhythm and that&rsquo;s going to just pop you</p>
<p>out of that slate so but there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things you can do</p>
<p>um once we kind of isolate where the</p>
<p>problem is coming from I really think it</p>
<p>could be adrenal but you were born with</p>
<p>this this situation and of course every</p>
<p>time you have your heart</p>
<p>shocked that puts another stress so</p>
<p>um in the meantime while you&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>for this unit</p>
<p>um you can watch my video on the stress</p>
<p>seminar I think it&rsquo;s called where you</p>
<p>actively</p>
<p>work on this these adrenal stress points</p>
<p>and start to do this manual therapy</p>
<p>before you go to sleep at night I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find great benefit with that but</p>
<p>in the meantime</p>
<p>start increasing your reserve or</p>
<p>electrolytes B1 and um</p>
<p>you know continue what you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>does take a bit of time with this</p>
<p>insulin resistance so</p>
<p>I hope that at least puts you in the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great Hey listen Martin we are</p>
<p>out of time so we really appreciate you</p>
<p>coming along with it we&rsquo;d love to hear</p>
<p>back on what we praise your great</p>
<p>success with that so thank you so much</p>
<p>for that let&rsquo;s launch on with quiz</p>
<p>question number three and there it is</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and I think do we we did we answer the</p>
<p>last question Steve</p>
<p>um oh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to be embarrassed if we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I think I</p>
<p>Terry did we</p>
<p>I think we must have Terry isn&rsquo;t arguing</p>
<p>with me otherwise but if we discover</p>
<p>otherwise well quiz question number two</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh was 65 said it&rsquo;s false and 35 yeah we</p>
<p>did we answered that okay okay good just</p>
<p>making sure okay so uh this question is</p>
<p>what triggers</p>
<p>growth hormone</p>
<p>more okay heat or cold therapy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of both of those</p>
<p>therapies going around everyone&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>freezing to death or sauna and</p>
<p>apparently both are pretty good for you</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll be interesting and our</p>
<p>producer Terry confirmed yes we did so</p>
<p>great no screw-ups on the questions yet</p>
<p>uh which I&rsquo;m known for okay aguzal from</p>
<p>YouTube I love you and I am grateful to</p>
<p>have you in my life hugs from ubekistan</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that great</p>
<p>uh well thank you for that uh guzal I</p>
<p>hope all is well with you there and uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see robot from YouTube is there</p>
<p>any relation between a vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiency and colon cancer</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t pop out as the most uh the</p>
<p>big correlation there but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible because of what the B vitamins</p>
<p>do to or in protection what they do in</p>
<p>the mitochondria in the Krebs cycle</p>
<p>so I could imagine if you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s B2 or B3 or B6 or B5 or B1</p>
<p>it can definitely set you up for a</p>
<p>mitochondrial</p>
<p>uh problems which is that&rsquo;s really where</p>
<p>the heart of this cancer starts from is</p>
<p>in the mitochondria so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is uh it&rsquo;s definitely possible all</p>
<p>right very good next from our Green Room</p>
<p>is a nice lady Nance and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>outside of Philly somewhere in Nance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg thank you so much</p>
<p>um I really enjoy you&rsquo;ve helped me so</p>
<p>much with regard to inflammation that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had I began keto uh and</p>
<p>intermittent intermittent fasting and uh</p>
<p>it is just really really help me I have</p>
<p>a quick question in that I am past</p>
<p>menopause and all of that but I have</p>
<p>noticed lately and I&rsquo;ve only been on</p>
<p>keto for six weeks and and the fasting</p>
<p>that it had fevers lately I&rsquo;ve had a few</p>
<p>fevers they don&rsquo;t last a long time</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re just almost like a hot flash</p>
<p>but I know it&rsquo;s not a hot flash so I</p>
<p>just wondered if you know what what</p>
<p>might be going on there</p>
<p>so do you feel okay when you have this</p>
<p>fever like your body just heats up or do</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re kind of running</p>
<p>down with something</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m getting sick or</p>
<p>anything I just feel like I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>kind of like a hot flash just a few</p>
<p>moments of of this fever</p>
<p>so and this is you&rsquo;ve noticed this when</p>
<p>you started keto right</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay so um</p>
<p>my Here&rsquo;s my thought on that um it could</p>
<p>be related not not like a hot flash or a</p>
<p>night sweat but the temperature control</p>
<p>of the body is located in the</p>
<p>hypothalamus</p>
<p>and so um you know here you made this</p>
<p>huge change and you&rsquo;re now in fat</p>
<p>burning and things may might be</p>
<p>adjusting one way or the other but</p>
<p>if it was a true fever I would say take</p>
<p>more calcium because that will snap</p>
<p>someone out of a fever but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need I think I would</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the pituitary and the hypothalamus and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great um</p>
<p>Standard Process product that I think</p>
<p>would benefit you and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s called e</p>
<p>manganese and it has has some</p>
<p>some pituitary extract in there but that</p>
<p>tends to work if you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>menopause and you have this uh like</p>
<p>these strange symptoms whether it could</p>
<p>be hot flash or anything involving</p>
<p>something called</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone or follicle</p>
<p>stimulating hormone which basically goes</p>
<p>down to the ovaries I think the E</p>
<p>manganese would probably be the best bet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a standard processed product</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not affiliated with them but you can</p>
<p>get that take one before bed and um I</p>
<p>think that might uh help you now as a</p>
<p>side note not that you have this</p>
<p>condition but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>really good for endometriosis I used to</p>
<p>use it um</p>
<p>a lot but it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s good to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>help helpful in connecting the dots</p>
<p>between the pituitary and over race that</p>
<p>whole pathway there</p>
<p>great great thank you so much I love</p>
<p>standard process so I will look that up</p>
<p>awesome thank you that&rsquo;s great thanks</p>
<p>for a great job Nance on the show with</p>
<p>us we appreciate that and we have</p>
<p>answers to quiz question number three</p>
<p>and uh it asks what triggers more growth</p>
<p>hormone heat or cold therapy which is so</p>
<p>popular these days and 72 percent of a</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s the cold therapy</p>
<p>and 28 say it&rsquo;s heat therapy any winners</p>
<p>cold in heat therapy like saunas</p>
<p>and uh cold immersion stimulate the heat</p>
<p>shock proteins which directly increase</p>
<p>growth hormone but</p>
<p>the heat therapy stimulates more growth</p>
<p>hormone</p>
<p>than the cold therapy but they both will</p>
<p>increase growth hormone now why would we</p>
<p>want to increase growth hormone</p>
<p>well maybe you&rsquo;re competing in some</p>
<p>world event where you need to have the</p>
<p>edge I&rsquo;m just being sarcastic you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take growth hormone from that</p>
<p>but but if you&rsquo;re um if you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>older the growth hormone tanks goes down</p>
<p>when you reach even from 65 years old</p>
<p>can it can go down over 50 or more</p>
<p>sometimes even 60 to 70 percent down so</p>
<p>here you&rsquo;re stuck with the growth</p>
<p>hormone so it&rsquo;s hard to build muscle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to build fat</p>
<p>uh and it&rsquo;s also hard to recover and</p>
<p>regenerate and rejuvenate and heal</p>
<p>without that growth hormone your your</p>
<p>highest peak of growth hormone is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in your late teens where you</p>
<p>could basically</p>
<p>heal very fast</p>
<p>and after that it goes downhill</p>
<p>so you have something to look forward to</p>
<p>everyone but um how do you increase that</p>
<p>growth hormone one way is just the sauna</p>
<p>treatments will give you a nice spike in</p>
<p>growth hormone and also heat will help</p>
<p>you sleep</p>
<p>and sleeping helps growth hormone so is</p>
<p>it the chicken or the egg well they both</p>
<p>can affect each other so both heat will</p>
<p>help you sleep and then</p>
<p>and increase growth hormone and then</p>
<p>sleep will help growth hormone increase</p>
<p>as well so they both complement each</p>
<p>other and it&rsquo;s something you want to</p>
<p>maybe add and if you don&rsquo;t have a sauna</p>
<p>maybe you could um take a hot shower and</p>
<p>stay in there for a little bit longer in</p>
<p>the evening</p>
<p>so that way you can sleep better at</p>
<p>night interesting so a quick thing is</p>
<p>there any set of rules is how long you</p>
<p>should stay in a sauna I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heat related I mean</p>
<p>I would go folk I would go to your</p>
<p>tolerance because you&rsquo;ll find that your</p>
<p>tolerance will increase over time some</p>
<p>people can tolerate initially for</p>
<p>depending on the temperature like five</p>
<p>minutes and then it goes up from there</p>
<p>and to the point where they take breaks</p>
<p>and they come out and they go back in</p>
<p>for in an hour</p>
<p>even longer but um</p>
<p>but yeah so you can do there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>benefits to that heat therapy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it adds the stress that your body will</p>
<p>then adapt to but I I&rsquo;m right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing them both I&rsquo;m doing the sauna and</p>
<p>then I jump right into that cold</p>
<p>immersion and that seems to be a nice</p>
<p>little one-two punch uh and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting very interesting</p>
<p>wonderful okay quiz question number four</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay what made your vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>can make you susceptible to getting a</p>
<p>stye that little thing in your eye where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s like this little pustle in</p>
<p>your eyelid it&rsquo;s very irritating</p>
<p>All Right audience climb on that because</p>
<p>no one likes styes uh let&rsquo;s see now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh poor Martha Marcia excuse me from</p>
<p>YouTube what&rsquo;s the best remedy for</p>
<p>migraines</p>
<p>just awful things</p>
<p>well one is that you need more sea salt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really kind of a no-brainer</p>
<p>um also niacin is another uh thing that</p>
<p>helps migraines</p>
<p>the other thing that I would look at as</p>
<p>well is some type of um</p>
<p>herbal support for your liver and that</p>
<p>could be a lot of different things milk</p>
<p>thistle it could be also um</p>
<p>turmeric that that seems to also be</p>
<p>really good for migraines but you can</p>
<p>watch my videos and that there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to figure that out sometimes you need</p>
<p>more of a history to see where it</p>
<p>started what happened right before that</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>um you know rule out the low hanging</p>
<p>fruit</p>
<p>all right very good okay our final</p>
<p>contestant if you will is Mike in Elkin</p>
<p>Maryland and Mike if you would unmute</p>
<p>yourself I&rsquo;m going to stick you on with</p>
<p>Dr Berg and as you talk to him I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to Center up your shot there we go</p>
<p>sitting up perfect go ahead with your</p>
<p>one quick question sir</p>
<p>sure thanks for having me though Burke</p>
<p>can you hear me okay perfectly all right</p>
<p>great doctor I purchased the I have a</p>
<p>calcium on my aortic valve it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>mild the moderate and uh and I saw your</p>
<p>uh D3 K2 vitamin and I wanted to try</p>
<p>that out and but my only question was</p>
<p>does the K2 cause any kind of clotting</p>
<p>is that something I should take an</p>
<p>aspirin you know an 81 or something like</p>
<p>that what do you think about that so</p>
<p>because vitamin K2 is in the family of</p>
<p>vitamin K K1 which is a clotting Factor</p>
<p>people assume well vitamin K2 will do</p>
<p>the same</p>
<p>I have not found any any information</p>
<p>that it says that it can clot at all and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at that very extensively you</p>
<p>can also do research on that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing that</p>
<p>you may want to consider</p>
<p>um and I will release a video on this is</p>
<p>to add</p>
<p>to that protocol NATO kinase</p>
<p>NATO kinase</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very powerful</p>
<p>anti-fibrotic</p>
<p>blood thinning natural remedy which also</p>
<p>is wonderful for deep plaque taking the</p>
<p>plaque out of your arteries not just the</p>
<p>calcium because the K2 is more the</p>
<p>calcium but also the fibrous tissue</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll really I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see if I can release that video tomorrow</p>
<p>just for you thank you you can learn</p>
<p>about it I think you&rsquo;ll find it very</p>
<p>interesting this you would think out of</p>
<p>all the research which will blow you</p>
<p>away on this NATO kinase that it would</p>
<p>be on the front page of the news but of</p>
<p>course we know why it&rsquo;s not right but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another great uh thing to um to</p>
<p>support that calcium calcification what</p>
<p>was your score</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>I should have it right here</p>
<p>um no casting Square which one uh total</p>
<p>coronary calcium score well</p>
<p>uh score uh I have different ones uh</p>
<p>799 929</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at different numbers here um</p>
<p>okay calcium volume</p>
<p>up you sit there</p>
<p>like you said</p>
<p>pull it back a little bit sir oh the</p>
<p>bottom line the bottom line is you want</p>
<p>it to be normal so uh right right zero</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you want it to be zero zero so</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the thing here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that you can do</p>
<p>whatever you do you know clean up your</p>
<p>diet and then retest it in about six to</p>
<p>eight weeks and</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going in the right direction and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing and keep going and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good feedback because</p>
<p>um you know I think you can change that</p>
<p>to score and then then you know for sure</p>
<p>well whatever you&rsquo;re doing is working of</p>
<p>course you got to really change your</p>
<p>diet and everything too but um the</p>
<p>endothelial part of that artery is</p>
<p>is kind of like a a barometer of your</p>
<p>lifestyle and all the things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating so I think um</p>
<p>stay tuned tomorrow for that video I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>post it awesome thank you so much I</p>
<p>really appreciate it thank you take care</p>
<p>great thanks a lot Mike for your great</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>thank you okay so let&rsquo;s see uh the</p>
<p>answer for quiz question number four</p>
<p>which asked of the audience what major</p>
<p>vitamin deficiency can you uh can make</p>
<p>you susceptible to one of those icky</p>
<p>styes and 65 of a respondents say it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vitamin A deficiency 15 say C deficiency</p>
<p>10 say it&rsquo;s vitamin D deficiency in the</p>
<p>final 10 say it&rsquo;s a zinc deficiency are</p>
<p>they on the right track</p>
<p>vitamin A is the answer</p>
<p>when your decision to vitamin A you</p>
<p>start to you could have what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>this extra keratin that builds up</p>
<p>on the skin and especially around the</p>
<p>sebaceous gland the oil gland and now</p>
<p>you have this uh this oil that can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>out and then it starts building up as</p>
<p>pressure and then you get this bacterial</p>
<p>infection and so you know the doctors</p>
<p>will Lancet they&rsquo;ll um maybe on an</p>
<p>antibiotic they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try to do something with it sometimes a</p>
<p>steroid shot</p>
<p>but what if it comes back what do you do</p>
<p>next you know do you keep doing that</p>
<p>um I think it&rsquo;s a good indicator of a</p>
<p>vitamin A deficiency and so</p>
<p>um what would you eat to increase your</p>
<p>vitamin A</p>
<p>cod liver oil</p>
<p>is the best thing of course egg yolks</p>
<p>are good but</p>
<p>even more than that is beef liver but um</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t like liver but those</p>
<p>are things that are very high in vitamin</p>
<p>A and that should help regulate the skin</p>
<p>and also uh the that little gland that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>developing around the little hair</p>
<p>follicle on your eye on your eyelid</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re uncomfortable okay final</p>
<p>question for the day Dr Berg and here it</p>
<p>is our truth another true falser</p>
<p>okay true or false melatonin helps you</p>
<p>go to sleep but it doesn&rsquo;t help you stay</p>
<p>asleep</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>go get it audience your final one and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to Facebook Nisha is</p>
<p>flaxseed good for post-menopausal women</p>
<p>with thyroid disease</p>
<p>yes it is good it is good absolutely so</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>it has a lot of uh um phytoestrogens</p>
<p>that will help to balance estrogen so it</p>
<p>helps to shift the ratios of the good</p>
<p>and bad estrogen so it is good for women</p>
<p>and also it gives you some other</p>
<p>additional cool things this is the</p>
<p>precursor to the omega-3 fatty acids and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other phytonutrients in</p>
<p>as well okay very good Leela from</p>
<p>YouTube what advice would you give to a</p>
<p>pregnant mother who has been diagnosed</p>
<p>with H pylori and a vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>well one of the best remedies for that</p>
<p>is sulforaphane from the broccoli</p>
<p>Sprouts or broccoli microgreens</p>
<p>um so start adding those into the salad</p>
<p>each day and then sulforaphane has been</p>
<p>known to suppress that microbe H pylori</p>
<p>that tends to create a lot of problems</p>
<p>for people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget to add betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride to your diet to start</p>
<p>increasing the acid because that little</p>
<p>sneaky devious microbe</p>
<p>starts to interfere with your</p>
<p>ammonia uh breakdown of protein forming</p>
<p>too much ammonia and ammonia is very</p>
<p>very alkaline so it basically creates</p>
<p>this ammonia to neutralize the stomach</p>
<p>acid so it can survive better</p>
<p>so how do we counter that</p>
<p>keep putting betaine hydrochloride into</p>
<p>your stomach before you eat to acidify</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>put that thing back in remission so many</p>
<p>people have this microbe living without</p>
<p>any harm in our stomachs it&rsquo;s only when</p>
<p>we change the environment and stress</p>
<p>them out that their relationship changes</p>
<p>and they become</p>
<p>from neutral to very unfriendly happens</p>
<p>with a lot of other microbes too if you</p>
<p>change the environment</p>
<p>their relationship changes</p>
<p>probably with people too right change</p>
<p>their environment and their relationship</p>
<p>changes they get pissed off well that</p>
<p>can happen very touchy uh breed as</p>
<p>humans I&rsquo;ll tell you all right so the</p>
<p>last quiz question of the day was a true</p>
<p>falser uh and it asked uh is melatonin</p>
<p>melatonin happily go to sleep but it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help you stay asleep do you wake</p>
<p>back up often 85 percent of respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true 15 say it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>false sleep all night</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s true it doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>stay asleep but it will definitely help</p>
<p>you fall asleep I don&rsquo;t recommend taking</p>
<p>melatonin a better way to get melatonin</p>
<p>is just from infrared from being out in</p>
<p>the sun</p>
<p>and um interesting it infrared is over</p>
<p>50 of this spectral energy from that Sun</p>
<p>so you get a lot of infrared you can</p>
<p>also get it from sitting in front of a</p>
<p>campfire or um</p>
<p>candles around</p>
<p>you or even like a fireplace so that</p>
<p>infrared</p>
<p>um stimulates a different type of uh</p>
<p>sourced melatonin that can actually help</p>
<p>your sleep as well</p>
<p>um but you can also get it from the Sun</p>
<p>or even a infrared light</p>
<p>uh which is a great therapy but um but</p>
<p>yeah so taking the supplements uh now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start to interrupt your um</p>
<p>your normal production from your pineal</p>
<p>and who knows what kind of complications</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create after that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>can get the first part of the Slate but</p>
<p>not the second half</p>
<p>because the first part is more of a deep</p>
<p>Delta wave sleep</p>
<p>which is the most important and then you</p>
<p>have the the REM sleep which is more</p>
<p>superficial which</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a paradox because here you</p>
<p>are sleeping but you&rsquo;re the waves are</p>
<p>similar to being awake so this is where</p>
<p>you dream and you remember your dreams</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s second half of the day but as we</p>
<p>age we kind of lose that second part of</p>
<p>sleep so you have to catch up</p>
<p>um with naps or trying to go back to</p>
<p>sleep I have a lot of videos and other</p>
<p>things you can do to support that as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>just so you know melatonin is uh</p>
<p>is mainly for the first part of the</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s all sit out in</p>
<p>the sun we could use that for vitamin D</p>
<p>and other things I&rsquo;m sure now the</p>
<p>audience and everyone has behaved so</p>
<p>well in the green room that we have a</p>
<p>little extra time so it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>all social media for the last uh five</p>
<p>minutes or so and let&rsquo;s hear from Kiki</p>
<p>from Facebook what do you recommend for</p>
<p>treating fever blisters or cold sores on</p>
<p>the lip</p>
<p>I would take</p>
<p>L-lysine okay to put the virus back in</p>
<p>vitamin C sometimes helps and zinc</p>
<p>all right very good you know this it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>virus that&rsquo;s come comes out of remission</p>
<p>when you go through stress</p>
<p>and uh so it&rsquo;s kind of like a stress</p>
<p>indicator that&rsquo;s why I think this uh</p>
<p>this little stress testing device that</p>
<p>measures your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be very important</p>
<p>because I have one and I you&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>kind of look and see inside your body</p>
<p>without doing a some type of operation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a real great test that you can</p>
<p>figure out like how stressed is your</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>what you need to do to improve it and</p>
<p>then use it as a biofeedback to see if</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is working</p>
<p>all right very good and I&rsquo;m asking this</p>
<p>one because I&rsquo;m excited about maybe</p>
<p>saying the name of this uh product right</p>
<p>sugar plum from YouTube my thyroid is</p>
<p>gone is it okay to take selenium and</p>
<p>levothyroxine did I say something right</p>
<p>there levothyroid yeah you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to take if your thyroid&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to take some type</p>
<p>of thyroid hormone for sure</p>
<p>um I I would prefer armor or some other</p>
<p>natural form but that&rsquo;s between you and</p>
<p>your doctor but selenium is also very</p>
<p>very important because that helps</p>
<p>many different parts and aspects of the</p>
<p>thyroid including the conversion from</p>
<p>the inactive T4 to the active T T3</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I mean like</p>
<p>the problem with you taking either a T3</p>
<p>or T4 without</p>
<p>is this the the thyroid produces more</p>
<p>than just these this T4 or T3 it</p>
<p>produces uh calcitonin</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that coming from</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re not um</p>
<p>if you have your thyroid removed</p>
<p>what is producing calcitonin well you</p>
<p>might say well it&rsquo;s not that important</p>
<p>well yeah it is for your bones and your</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>works with the parathyroid hopefully you</p>
<p>still have the parathyroid</p>
<p>but um I would watch my videos on on</p>
<p>those topics because there&rsquo;s a lot more</p>
<p>to be said on that</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s a curiosity TV they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re calling themselves from Texas on</p>
<p>YouTube why is your unflavored collagen</p>
<p>product red</p>
<p>where why is my unflavored collagen</p>
<p>product red yeah does that make does</p>
<p>that make sense</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a collagen product</p>
<p>wow well if you did why would you make</p>
<p>it red now</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ll just set some food coloring to</p>
<p>make it look good no I don&rsquo;t know I have</p>
<p>no idea well sorry about that maybe</p>
<p>check the label see who&rsquo;s making that</p>
<p>stuff and um I hope they can solve that</p>
<p>for you uh Ali from YouTube what are</p>
<p>your thoughts about taking ashwagandha</p>
<p>I like it I like it it&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>adaptogens again related to stress</p>
<p>increasing your capacity to stress so</p>
<p>you have a couple different aspects of</p>
<p>this you have um</p>
<p>stress hitting you right and then your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s reaction and also how much</p>
<p>Reserve do you have in the tank how much</p>
<p>capacity do you have to handle stress</p>
<p>do you is your tolerance for stress low</p>
<p>medium or high well ashwagandha what it</p>
<p>does is it</p>
<p>it improves that it starts to build up a</p>
<p>reserves so you can handle more and more</p>
<p>stress and not fly off the handle but</p>
<p>just have this reserved that you can</p>
<p>deal with life and not get so flustered</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a great thing it&rsquo;s been used for</p>
<p>a couple years now I think over two</p>
<p>thousand</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several adaptogens as well like</p>
<p>ginseng is one but I like ashwagandha</p>
<p>um a lot because</p>
<p>um you feel good after it and you feel</p>
<p>like a sense of relief huh is that a</p>
<p>product you sell or is it in a product</p>
<p>you saw Yes yes we do have an</p>
<p>ashwagandha uh</p>
<p>high quality uh ashwagandha product so</p>
<p>great yes all right Catherine from</p>
<p>Facebook of course I&rsquo;m not biased no not</p>
<p>at all in fact he&rsquo;s hoping that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>purchase it somewhere else Catherine</p>
<p>from Facebook what are the best</p>
<p>supplements to take for chronic</p>
<p>gastritis</p>
<p>the best thing for gastritis would be</p>
<p>cabbage juice</p>
<p>or eat cabbage</p>
<p>um zinc is important as well</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s one condition where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take betaine Hydrochloric or an</p>
<p>acid or apple cider vinegar because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna worsen that irritation to</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder is a really good</p>
<p>one too with mixing with some water sip</p>
<p>it down there it tends to calm down the</p>
<p>stomach acid</p>
<p>um also zinc carnosine is another</p>
<p>essential nutrient for that so</p>
<p>yeah I have more data in my videos on</p>
<p>that topic well that&rsquo;s interesting well</p>
<p>the audience heard the call we needed a</p>
<p>lot of Social Media stuff to round out</p>
<p>the show and they certainly gave it to</p>
<p>us so uh you know thank you for keeping</p>
<p>us from experiencing what&rsquo;s known as</p>
<p>dead air when we&rsquo;re staring in the</p>
<p>microphone and you did it so thank you</p>
<p>for that and the doc I guess that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>for the weekend</p>
<p>hey thanks everyone uh stay tuned next</p>
<p>week I have some really interesting</p>
<p>videos coming up I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy</p>
<p>them have a great weekend</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
