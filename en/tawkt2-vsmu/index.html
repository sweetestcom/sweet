<p>this is my fifth week following keto and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my fourth week of intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um and even though i&rsquo;m doing what i know</p>
<p>to do right now i rarely achieve even a</p>
<p>moderate level of ketosis my glucose</p>
<p>ranges from mid 80s to 100</p>
<p>my ketones rarely move above 0.8</p>
<p>and my gki is most often</p>
<p>7 or 8.</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>in addition to continuing keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting what other steps</p>
<p>should i consider</p>
<p>how long is how long is your fasting</p>
<p>cycle</p>
<p>how many hours are you fasting for</p>
<p>most days are about 22</p>
<p>and several days a week i do 24 a little</p>
<p>bit more</p>
<p>okay and as far as your carb</p>
<p>amounts do you feel like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>100 or is it</p>
<p>close to 100</p>
<p>are you sort of doing it</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>stay under 20 carbs a day i don&rsquo;t cheat</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been doing you know what i know</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and then how about your sleep do you</p>
<p>have any problems with sleep</p>
<p>i i did for a while it&rsquo;s improving now</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>normally right now it&rsquo;s good how about</p>
<p>your stress level is there any issue</p>
<p>with your stress level</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty high i&rsquo;m an elementary</p>
<p>school counselor and i have</p>
<p>two-year-olds win</p>
<p>so um i stay very busy so i would i have</p>
<p>considered that cortisol and stress may</p>
<p>be you know part of it but i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>what i can to mitigate that but some</p>
<p>things are here to say</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what about um</p>
<p>your clothes are they feeling any looser</p>
<p>yet</p>
<p>yes i have i&rsquo;ve achieved some inches in</p>
<p>some weight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very pleased with that just</p>
<p>you know confused as to why my you know</p>
<p>the numbers aren&rsquo;t showing</p>
<p>what they sh i would assume they would</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>what about your</p>
<p>hunger uh do you find you still have an</p>
<p>appetite or is your hunger gone away</p>
<p>for the first</p>
<p>three weeks i</p>
<p>i felt really really good i&rsquo;ve had very</p>
<p>little hunger</p>
<p>this week has been a little bit more</p>
<p>cravings for you know food in between my</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>um i didn&rsquo;t eat but i i felt different</p>
<p>this week than i did the first two</p>
<p>okay well i think you&rsquo;re doing a lot of</p>
<p>things correct so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>a good amount of time um</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s always things we can improve</p>
<p>it i think um</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s obviously the stress the</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>is like eating sugar unfortunately</p>
<p>because it jacks up cortisol to a</p>
<p>certain degree and then that</p>
<p>releases sugar but if you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>sugar your body makes sugar</p>
<p>out of other things</p>
<p>so what we have to do is we have to</p>
<p>counter the stresses so when you get</p>
<p>home from work um</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing other things</p>
<p>physical work cleaning or physical</p>
<p>exercise something to kind of</p>
<p>reduce the stress is</p>
<p>as well as a lot of b1 and nutritional</p>
<p>yeast and</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s going to be your focus</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>your carbs are low enough and your</p>
<p>fasting is good so there&rsquo;s always some</p>
<p>other reason you can also add in a bit</p>
<p>more exercise maybe try to improve your</p>
<p>sleep but i think your stress level um</p>
<p>is probably the culprit right now and</p>
<p>the based on all these other great</p>
<p>results i think it&rsquo;s working but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just working slower than it should um</p>
<p>if the clothes are looser that means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working if you</p>
<p>if you lose your appetite that means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really working your energy&rsquo;s up it</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s working and also as you</p>
<p>increase um</p>
<p>over the age of 35 40 and get in the 50s</p>
<p>the first part of keto could be more on</p>
<p>the healing phase than the getting</p>
<p>healthy phase which you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>maybe feeling stronger maybe your</p>
<p>clothes are shrinking</p>
<p>because the proteins have to build up so</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t actually worry about the</p>
<p>ketones</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that i would i</p>
<p>would focus more on maybe</p>
<p>even improving</p>
<p>you know maybe you go a little longer</p>
<p>with fasting or</p>
<p>make sure the quality of food is there</p>
<p>and try to focus on getting the stress</p>
<p>down as much as possible i have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on that i would watch all of them</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>improve your sleep and i think</p>
<p>and just give it more time because i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re on the right track we just</p>
<p>need to tweak things a little bit more</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s so exciting when</p>
<p>i hear people in addition to the great</p>
<p>benefits of keto to add in intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and i have</p>
<p>successfully been on that for i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know maybe three years and it has become</p>
<p>so routine that i don&rsquo;t struggle</p>
<p>throughout my life i have dieted like</p>
<p>everyone else and when i had success i</p>
<p>was white knuckling it i was you know</p>
<p>always anxious would love to go out and</p>
<p>cheat and so on and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>has just taken that away from me and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like anna i do</p>
<p>you know probably 22 hours of fasting</p>
<p>and then a glorious couple hours of</p>
<p>eating good stuff</p>
<p>and i just don&rsquo;t have to think about</p>
<p>food for the rest of the day and it</p>
<p>takes a while for that sort of habitual</p>
<p>feeling to come in because i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>disciplined i mean i like stuff and i</p>
<p>want to be sated</p>
<p>uh when i really don&rsquo;t need to so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really excited for you anna just keep up</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>great work and intermittent fasting will</p>
<p>finally settle in i think if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>anything like me and i&rsquo;m a tough case so</p>
<p>thank you all for doing that dr berg why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>uh kick off our first quiz question i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited about them too there&rsquo;s some cool</p>
<p>ones and here&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>true or false</p>
<p>mushrooms are a good source of vitamin d</p>
<p>all right jump on what you guys have to</p>
<p>say about that absolutely jump on that</p>
<p>okay and the social media is absolutely</p>
<p>alive let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>okay so dixie from facebook should type</p>
<p>2 diabetes do an insulin fast what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re taking insulin or</p>
<p>not but if you&rsquo;re doing an instant fast</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not consuming any insulin um i i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>insulin so let&rsquo;s just take a look at</p>
<p>how you would increase insulin and that</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>increasing carbs and eating frequently</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>absolutely positively yes</p>
<p>fasting insulin or just or removing</p>
<p>insulin from your your body for a whole</p>
<p>day would be the best thing you could do</p>
<p>for a diabetic because think about it</p>
<p>when you get diabetes pre-diabetes and</p>
<p>then the first part of diabetes you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting to the point where now the</p>
<p>pancreas is so exhausted to try to fight</p>
<p>through this resistance</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like talking to someone</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>who will not be able to listen to you</p>
<p>um you may get frustrated you may just</p>
<p>give up talking to them and so or you</p>
<p>may start shouting</p>
<p>initially and then you&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>up that&rsquo;s what the pancreas is doing</p>
<p>because um</p>
<p>the receptors the ears on the other side</p>
<p>are not receiving that message so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what you want to do is you want to take</p>
<p>insulin down</p>
<p>way down by fasting insulin you know i</p>
<p>like that just like a</p>
<p>like not stimulating insulin and then</p>
<p>what happens</p>
<p>especially with fasting your receptors</p>
<p>for insulin become very very sensitive</p>
<p>you now become insulin sensitive so now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not this resistance</p>
<p>and and then watch what happens now</p>
<p>insulin can start working and lowering</p>
<p>your blood sugar and now you can</p>
<p>move away from being a diabetic type two</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s exciting well our audience</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>viewers do not mess around and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already answered believe it or not quiz</p>
<p>question number one</p>
<p>which asks true or false mushrooms are a</p>
<p>good source of vitamin d</p>
<p>and the survey results are in 78 of a</p>
<p>respondent say it&rsquo;s true and 22 say no</p>
<p>way who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>all right this is a bit of a trick</p>
<p>question and i&rsquo;m doing a video on this</p>
<p>topic and the title of the video will be</p>
<p>something in relationship to how to make</p>
<p>your own vitamin d supplement</p>
<p>do it yourself</p>
<p>mushrooms normally come with a very tiny</p>
<p>amount of vitamin d</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in d2</p>
<p>which is a bit more</p>
<p>difficult to</p>
<p>absorb and it&rsquo;s just as a very</p>
<p>short um</p>
<p>half-life so it disappears pretty</p>
<p>quickly but</p>
<p>but steve</p>
<p>if you expose</p>
<p>these mushrooms that you grow</p>
<p>you find or you buy from the store if</p>
<p>you expose them</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>uv radiation uvb specifically from the</p>
<p>sun</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>a uv light</p>
<p>you can boost</p>
<p>the vitamin d in these mushrooms</p>
<p>significantly to the point of</p>
<p>even with a few hours you can boost them</p>
<p>up 5 000 ius per per handful that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a serving</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s like a 100 100 grams</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you take your</p>
<p>mushrooms and i&rsquo;m going to teach you how</p>
<p>to do this and you put them on a cookie</p>
<p>sheet and put them outside in the sun in</p>
<p>the summer</p>
<p>for eight hours</p>
<p>you can spike</p>
<p>that vitamin d</p>
<p>up to 46 000 iu&rsquo;s now um you would have</p>
<p>to do that for two days okay like you</p>
<p>take them in and put them back out but</p>
<p>you can spike them up now there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>studies that just take it to the next</p>
<p>level and you can put it under uv for 14</p>
<p>hours and they&rsquo;ve experimented they</p>
<p>brought the vitamin d2 levels up to</p>
<p>over 200 000 iu&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so basically</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to show you how to make your</p>
<p>own vitamin d supplements</p>
<p>with some mushrooms which is like</p>
<p>very inexpensive and you put them and</p>
<p>you dry them out</p>
<p>which is will be in the sun and then you</p>
<p>put them in your um</p>
<p>put them in a glass jar and consume them</p>
<p>so this is very exciting because</p>
<p>even though you can&rsquo;t absorb vitamin d</p>
<p>two like vitamin d3</p>
<p>the amounts that you can get from this</p>
<p>process are so high that</p>
<p>doing any bit of this will greatly</p>
<p>improve your vitamin d levels</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i guess that was a trick question wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it steve well a little bit but very</p>
<p>exciting the way you expanded on it now</p>
<p>we can all enjoy our mushrooms and know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re healthy as well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing these are already harvested</p>
<p>right but it can just still bring it out</p>
<p>in them that&rsquo;s amazing yeah well yeah</p>
<p>and uh shiitake uh mataki um</p>
<p>also button mushrooms oyster</p>
<p>so those you want the ones with the</p>
<p>gills because you want to expose the</p>
<p>gills that&rsquo;s where you get all the</p>
<p>vitamin d conversion but</p>
<p>in the mushroom the button mushrooms you</p>
<p>have to slice them to increase the</p>
<p>surface area so i&rsquo;m going to explain</p>
<p>this whole thing in a video that i&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>right after this show well i can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>to see that okay sonya from youtube went</p>
<p>on a 21 day water fast but now she feels</p>
<p>like she has spider veins breaking out</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s very itchy she wants to know</p>
<p>what to do</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re coming from that</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>if you do fast</p>
<p>and you do get spider veins all that</p>
<p>means is that you&rsquo;re low in vitamin c</p>
<p>so this is why i always recommend to</p>
<p>take certain vitamins while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting to make sure that you don&rsquo;t end</p>
<p>up with a deficiency</p>
<p>a really good</p>
<p>way to handle spider veins if you really</p>
<p>want to know would be</p>
<p>the vitamin c from a whole lemon</p>
<p>you take the whole lemon</p>
<p>12 ounces of water put it right in the</p>
<p>blender with um a little drop of stevia</p>
<p>i use my</p>
<p>electrolytes because it&rsquo;s sweetened with</p>
<p>minerals just to sweeten i put a scoop</p>
<p>of that</p>
<p>put the water in blend it up for 45</p>
<p>seconds and drink that down</p>
<p>the peel of that lemon has five times</p>
<p>the vitamin c complex so we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the bioflavonoids</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>is part of the vitamin p</p>
<p>p it&rsquo;s actually part of vitamin p which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re growing vitamin p i haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>about that uh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they came up with back in i think</p>
<p>the 30s or 40s</p>
<p>and that stands for permeability because</p>
<p>it fixes</p>
<p>um permeability issues like leaking</p>
<p>blood through vessels</p>
<p>so it tightens all that up so it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for bleeding gums uh spider veins um</p>
<p>any type of</p>
<p>brew excess of bruising things like that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you want to do</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific well</p>
<p>dr burger shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise</p>
<p>that we have viewers all over the world</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go through the list</p>
<p>the uk canada algeria ghana zambia india</p>
<p>germany france croatia mexico scotland</p>
<p>belgium the netherlands bermuda bermuda</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t heard from them in a while</p>
<p>spain united arab emirates sweden</p>
<p>pakistan hungary romania nigeria italy</p>
<p>singapore ireland saudi arabia russia</p>
<p>taiwan south africa switzerland cameroon</p>
<p>trinidad and tobago chile</p>
<p>philippines kuwait puerto rico vietnam</p>
<p>there we go haven&rsquo;t heard from them for</p>
<p>a while either oh come on antarctica and</p>
<p>all across these united states says</p>
<p>thanks everybody including all those</p>
<p>folks in the states that are watching us</p>
<p>and uh that&rsquo;s just terrific why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>go on with the next uh quiz question</p>
<p>and this is we haven&rsquo;t had anyone call</p>
<p>from siberia in a while i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>no we have it but you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to get an open line it&rsquo;s tough</p>
<p>out there</p>
<p>so dr berg here&rsquo;s our next question</p>
<p>okay which country in the world</p>
<p>is the top consumer of sugar</p>
<p>i was going to say terry our producer</p>
<p>but i guess that&rsquo;s not really what you</p>
<p>asked anyway so dig into that yeah we</p>
<p>want to know of a country who consumes</p>
<p>the most sugar</p>
<p>out of anyone else in the world let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see if you guys can</p>
<p>uh pick this one</p>
<p>okay and melissa from facebook what are</p>
<p>the best b vitamins to take for tinnitus</p>
<p>and how much should i take</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really really deficient um you</p>
<p>may want to take some uh find a natural</p>
<p>form of b1</p>
<p>um which</p>
<p>you know i will be doing more videos on</p>
<p>that probably in the next couple weeks</p>
<p>but nutritional yeast will give you a</p>
<p>good source of b vitamins it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to find</p>
<p>um the natural sources even</p>
<p>even these vitamins</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve really done some research</p>
<p>even the vitamins when you go</p>
<p>buy them natural food base right</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re made from yeast but they spike</p>
<p>them with synthetics so they feed the</p>
<p>yeast synthetic vitamins and they call</p>
<p>that natural so a little sneaky little</p>
<p>loophole there but</p>
<p>the problem with these natural b</p>
<p>vitamins is that they</p>
<p>they um</p>
<p>are expensive to make and that is the</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>people just make them cheaply and</p>
<p>and so you end up getting that part</p>
<p>however for neuritis there&rsquo;s one one</p>
<p>specific</p>
<p>uh type of b vitamin b1 that is</p>
<p>synthetic that i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to recommend</p>
<p>for especially like neuropathy type</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy issues</p>
<p>um is the benfotamine</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the one that apparently</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s fat soluble and</p>
<p>synthetic</p>
<p>it um</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any side effects</p>
<p>so that would be one that would be good</p>
<p>for any type of neuritis</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the b vitamin especially b1</p>
<p>is everything nerve support</p>
<p>so it supports the</p>
<p>the bloods flow to the nerve</p>
<p>it helps heal the nerve it supports the</p>
<p>myelin sheath</p>
<p>and it does a a lot of stuff with that</p>
<p>and also for the brain it supports</p>
<p>certain parts of your brain called</p>
<p>hippocampus to help you with memory</p>
<p>and reduce stress</p>
<p>especially the nervous anxiety that</p>
<p>people have if you take um</p>
<p>if you have this nervous tension built</p>
<p>up like pressure like you wanna like</p>
<p>you may have a low tolerance to</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>you take some b1 within about three</p>
<p>minutes you&rsquo;re just going to feel</p>
<p>chilled out so yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool you</p>
<p>say is i have a mouthful of nutritional</p>
<p>yeast uh so a ross from youtube and this</p>
<p>is an oft-asked question and i know you</p>
<p>find it to be very important can</p>
<p>breastfeeding mothers do keto and iaf</p>
<p>what recommendation do you have for them</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those questions that i have</p>
<p>to give a disclaimer because</p>
<p>i could just see someone say oh yeah dr</p>
<p>berg says</p>
<p>you can go on a diet and you can fast</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re breastfeeding so this is my</p>
<p>my clarification um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re breastfeeding you want to make</p>
<p>sure you get all the nutrients so</p>
<p>do you want to do fasting probably not</p>
<p>um do you want to do keto</p>
<p>yes because</p>
<p>but definitely you have to do it</p>
<p>healthily as far as getting all the</p>
<p>nutrients because that is the most</p>
<p>important well i&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s the second</p>
<p>most important time</p>
<p>for um making sure that that</p>
<p>new development of that baby is going to</p>
<p>be just</p>
<p>a super healthy baby and then also the</p>
<p>the more important time is would be the</p>
<p>time of pregnancy you know and even</p>
<p>before that so important um</p>
<p>because just a little deficiency</p>
<p>of one little nutrient</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>end up with devastating consequences</p>
<p>even the child uh growing with</p>
<p>now a</p>
<p>malformation of their skeletal system</p>
<p>they can have bowed legs they could have</p>
<p>scoliosis kyphosis hunchback um</p>
<p>dental</p>
<p>malformations</p>
<p>the bite on the teeth it could be off so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>once you have the knowledge of what to</p>
<p>eat or what to get or what to take</p>
<p>well you can</p>
<p>prevent a lot of issues down the road</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen with that baby</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>the the mental capacity for the child</p>
<p>with with iodine deficiencies</p>
<p>so i really want to</p>
<p>have anyone who&rsquo;s pregnant watch or</p>
<p>breastfeeding watch my videos on on what</p>
<p>to eat and what to take</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>the top selling prenatal</p>
<p>vitamin</p>
<p>in the world</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>pure</p>
<p>synthetics</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing cheap petroleum based</p>
<p>raw material</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re getting a great</p>
<p>thing because it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s popular</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of reviews but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very inexpensive</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s inexpensive because it has very</p>
<p>low quality materials so why would you</p>
<p>ever want to</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re pregnant is just you</p>
<p>wanna you wanna you don&rsquo;t wanna go with</p>
<p>the least expensive when you&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>you wanna get something that has all the</p>
<p>the right amount of nutrition so that</p>
<p>child has everything it needs</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>so anyway uh</p>
<p>mia the lovely mia from arizona was once</p>
<p>a child but now she&rsquo;s all grown up and</p>
<p>has a question for you doctor you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with dr birdman</p>
<p>hello it&rsquo;s nice to meet you thank you</p>
<p>for having me on</p>
<p>sure i love watching your videos i share</p>
<p>them all the time with people and</p>
<p>honestly i could answer ask a million</p>
<p>questions but i&rsquo;m going to focus on what</p>
<p>i put in for this interview and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve been dealing with candida</p>
<p>overgrowth for a while after having</p>
<p>surgery</p>
<p>and although it&rsquo;s a lot better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still clearly a problem</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve heard from a lot of different</p>
<p>sources that because of having candida</p>
<p>you have to avoid going into ketosis</p>
<p>because ketones can feed candida</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m wondering first if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accurate and also then if it is</p>
<p>at what point do you know that you are</p>
<p>balanced enough and cleared enough that</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s safe to actually try to go</p>
<p>with the ketosis because i know the</p>
<p>benefits of it</p>
<p>so i have a question um</p>
<p>when you had the surgery did they give</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>antibiotics yes i had antibiotics and</p>
<p>also steroids and then the situation got</p>
<p>worse because i started getting chronic</p>
<p>sinus infections which i never had</p>
<p>before because it was obviously the</p>
<p>candida and so they gave me more</p>
<p>antibiotics and more steroids and then</p>
<p>it got to a very bad level and then i</p>
<p>did my own research and figured it out</p>
<p>i got it okay so uh candida is a type of</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the family of fungus and molds</p>
<p>and things like that and so in your body</p>
<p>you actually have normal</p>
<p>type of candida that lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not pathogenic it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>problem it&rsquo;s under control but what you</p>
<p>have now is an overgrowth of um disease</p>
<p>and that happens</p>
<p>mostly with antibiotics but it can</p>
<p>happen with steroids as well</p>
<p>so when you kill off the bacteria the</p>
<p>bacteria normally</p>
<p>keep the candida in check</p>
<p>so what we need to do is we need to</p>
<p>fortify you with a a really good um</p>
<p>probiotic that will uh build up the</p>
<p>bacterial families so then they can keep</p>
<p>the yeast fungus mold and candida in</p>
<p>check um but it&rsquo;s false information</p>
<p>completely 100 false information that</p>
<p>candida lives on</p>
<p>ketones they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re carb junkies</p>
<p>they are total carb junkies just like</p>
<p>all all these other bacteria and they</p>
<p>like carb</p>
<p>especially sugar and milk sugar so um</p>
<p>the best diet is to go on like as low</p>
<p>sugar as complete as possible um yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve actually i&rsquo;ve done the no grains no</p>
<p>sugar no dairy no alcohol no caffeine</p>
<p>um and it helped um but after i started</p>
<p>to feel a little better after a couple</p>
<p>months i started to kind of give in a</p>
<p>little bit and i do take probiotics i</p>
<p>take antifungals i could probably start</p>
<p>a store with all the supplements that i</p>
<p>have it&rsquo;s just i haven&rsquo;t figured out to</p>
<p>get to that point where i feel like i</p>
<p>can maintain it</p>
<p>like if i give in in any way it comes</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>yeah i totally understand so what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing now is you&rsquo;re building up a</p>
<p>reserve so you can have that flexibility</p>
<p>to go off a little bit but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>quite there um realize too that um</p>
<p>food-wise</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be very very important to have</p>
<p>um some high quality fermented foods</p>
<p>like sauerkraut or kimchi are the best</p>
<p>ones versus</p>
<p>the yogurts the um kiefer type things</p>
<p>if you start to kind of on a regular</p>
<p>basis keep that in your system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you build up those</p>
<p>microbes so really your your goal now is</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>learn more and support your</p>
<p>friendly flora that&rsquo;s really what</p>
<p>your goals should be right now and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;ll get better and</p>
<p>better but i will say to</p>
<p>reestablish</p>
<p>that entire microbial</p>
<p>microbiome</p>
<p>does take</p>
<p>some months</p>
<p>it does take some time it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>overnight so i think that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at i think you&rsquo;re on the right track but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i guess your body is saying stay strict</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>yeah for for a long time</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>but so but it but it is okay to be in</p>
<p>ketosis though that ketones don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>it totally is because it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>um i mean the microbiome um i mean even</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>your microbes the bacteria</p>
<p>make a version of ketones called butyric</p>
<p>butyric acid</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>from fiber</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t feed the the candida they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>candida</p>
<p>love their sugar lovers</p>
<p>yeah and also cortisol right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another issue the cortisol tends to um</p>
<p>definitely think about this right</p>
<p>cortisol is a synthetic version of um</p>
<p>well the type you had was a synthetic</p>
<p>version of cortisol cortisol</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>glucocorticoid which means</p>
<p>it stimulates and causes the body to</p>
<p>mark more glucose feeding the microbe to</p>
<p>the candida</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the problem and i</p>
<p>unfortunately i have too much cortisone</p>
<p>as well but uh yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running into</p>
<p>well mia best of absolutely i think</p>
<p>stress yeah i&rsquo;m sorry go ahead oh i was</p>
<p>just gonna say we you you&rsquo;re being so</p>
<p>disciplined i&rsquo;m sorry that it&rsquo;s not all</p>
<p>coming out cause i&rsquo;m less disciplined</p>
<p>and i seem to have all the joys but</p>
<p>anyway uh thank you mia for introducing</p>
<p>do you have another comment for dr burke</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>oh well i was just gonna follow up with</p>
<p>i think stress is also a factor i think</p>
<p>that because i&rsquo;m in constant stress and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>handle even if you&rsquo;re being completely</p>
<p>strict with everything else then the</p>
<p>stress is activating the feeding of the</p>
<p>candida so i think that might be a</p>
<p>factor too</p>
<p>right right and i keep harping on the</p>
<p>stresses</p>
<p>you just really have to um have an</p>
<p>attitude of um kind of a the term is</p>
<p>insoucian it&rsquo;s a french word which means</p>
<p>uh carefree as much as possible</p>
<p>not too serious</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>easier said than done but it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>important to have that attitude and then</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>all the other things like</p>
<p>doing physical work and exercise to</p>
<p>counter that stress so welcome to planet</p>
<p>earth</p>
<p>yeah stress is hard to avoid yeah right</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>wow well that&rsquo;s great well once again</p>
<p>thank you so much you bet mia best of</p>
<p>luck and keep in touch with by the way</p>
<p>any of you that come on this if you have</p>
<p>some changes or positive or negative or</p>
<p>anything we&rsquo;d love to hear from you</p>
<p>again so uh don&rsquo;t forget to uh reapply</p>
<p>to come on and i would mention i was on</p>
<p>before and now all sorts of great things</p>
<p>or troubling things have happened and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get you on again so</p>
<p>thanks uh so much for participating now</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>uh our quiz questions and this one asks</p>
<p>which country is the top consumer</p>
<p>of uh sugar in the world and our</p>
<p>participants</p>
<p>55 say the united states 25 say saudi</p>
<p>arabia 10 say india and 10 say either</p>
<p>united arab emirates turkey or france</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a cop-out choose one</p>
<p>anyway are we on to something okay so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at the top consumer so</p>
<p>population does matter with this</p>
<p>question too if you have more people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to consume more so the</p>
<p>answer is india</p>
<p>um people in india can are the biggest</p>
<p>consumer of sugar on the planet they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the second biggest producer of sugar</p>
<p>they invented the process of how to</p>
<p>refine sugar</p>
<p>over 2 000 years ago um they</p>
<p>they consume massive amounts of their</p>
<p>own traditional sugars which they kind</p>
<p>of like molasses type sugar mixed with</p>
<p>unrefined versus refined so um i mean if</p>
<p>you ever go</p>
<p>to in in in america an indian</p>
<p>market right</p>
<p>can you find anything without sugar</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>you ever go steve have you ever been to</p>
<p>an indian restaurant before oh many</p>
<p>times</p>
<p>many times is there many things without</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>well i i couldn&rsquo;t yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>carbs desserts everything is like</p>
<p>they just pile in the sugar so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s part of their tradition</p>
<p>the cultures um</p>
<p>it just goes on and on i will be</p>
<p>releasing a video on that so so now you</p>
<p>guys know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>part of it but uh it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>interesting and so</p>
<p>i mean the massive amount of diabetes</p>
<p>obesity high blood pressure is off the</p>
<p>charts so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna have to change by individuals</p>
<p>like you</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>i think uh you being a success story and</p>
<p>people looking around you going oh wow</p>
<p>what are you doing i want to do that so</p>
<p>um but you know they&rsquo;re trying to put</p>
<p>taxes on</p>
<p>junk food and sugary um drinks i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the long-term answer</p>
<p>because it has to come through education</p>
<p>and not through</p>
<p>force or do this or else that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always work</p>
<p>certainly not with me and you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been wondering who to blame for my diet</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>my diet shortfall and it&rsquo;s india so but</p>
<p>i still love their food and i will</p>
<p>continue</p>
<p>uh to go to the restaurants because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so delicious i&rsquo;ve mentioned before that</p>
<p>my sister-in-law is indian from india</p>
<p>from delhi so i&rsquo;ve been addicted to that</p>
<p>stuff for the last 40 years it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>amazing amazing foods amazing foods i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you it really is okay so um</p>
<p>we did that quiz question let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to social media for a moment if we can</p>
<p>and uh lenora from facebook my sister is</p>
<p>in a wheelchair</p>
<p>due to her ms multiple sclerosis what</p>
<p>sort of nutrition plan would you</p>
<p>recommend for her or anyone with that</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>i would</p>
<p>find my video on ms and watch that</p>
<p>make notes there&rsquo;s a researcher from</p>
<p>brazil who talks about using high doses</p>
<p>of vitamin d3</p>
<p>like in over 50 000 i use and he has a</p>
<p>protocol and i actually listed that</p>
<p>protocol in the description of the video</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s three things one is you want</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation using the vitamin</p>
<p>d on a regular basis</p>
<p>number two omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>are great for inflammation and also</p>
<p>supporting your brain</p>
<p>and the fourth thing</p>
<p>is this thing called fasting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard about it</p>
<p>before but it produces probably some of</p>
<p>the most powerful</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory effects</p>
<p>over anything you can do</p>
<p>and so you have to do regular fasting</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>prolonged</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting to really</p>
<p>pull your body out of this inflammatory</p>
<p>state in your brain to a state where you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>no inflammation where the brain can</p>
<p>start healing</p>
<p>and the immune system can start</p>
<p>regenerating</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s definitely um</p>
<p>i think those three things would be the</p>
<p>most important things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fantastic well let&rsquo;s keep up with</p>
<p>the audience on these questions they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so fast with it here&rsquo;s the next one</p>
<p>okay true or false</p>
<p>phytoestrogens from plants</p>
<p>can enlarge the prostate</p>
<p>so many many types of things you eat</p>
<p>have estrogen compounds that are natural</p>
<p>um do they have the ability to affect</p>
<p>the prostate yes or no or true or false</p>
<p>good grief all those guys with prostate</p>
<p>so many ways to whack it</p>
<p>at least 50</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two reports i read at least 50</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>of men over the age of 60 start</p>
<p>developing in a large prostate and then</p>
<p>other reports is like 8 out of 10.</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a high incident it&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>wow okay myrmo from facebook my 90 year</p>
<p>old dad</p>
<p>is diabetic and often gets utis how can</p>
<p>he fix this boy at 90.</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i think you probably guess what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to say you want to get on keto</p>
<p>fast and intimate fasting because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re diabetic and</p>
<p>and as you do that</p>
<p>you can stop feeding these microbes that</p>
<p>are living in your urinary tract and</p>
<p>until you do that i don&rsquo;t think some</p>
<p>remedies are going to really create</p>
<p>an impact</p>
<p>but think about if you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>and the kidneys are dumping sugar</p>
<p>through um</p>
<p>the urinary tract it&rsquo;s like a breeding</p>
<p>ground of frenzy a frenzy for microbes</p>
<p>to eat that sugar and live in those</p>
<p>areas</p>
<p>in the ureter and</p>
<p>bladder so</p>
<p>as well as the kidneys so again these</p>
<p>these microbes are sugar junkies when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain types of</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;m studying now about soil</p>
<p>and many times you can spike the</p>
<p>bacterial growth in soil and the fungal</p>
<p>growth by adding some molasses to it but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to keep doing it because</p>
<p>you turn them all into sugar junkies</p>
<p>just like in the us and other parts of</p>
<p>the world so</p>
<p>too many carbs</p>
<p>will um</p>
<p>cause an addiction to microbes</p>
<p>as well as in people</p>
<p>oh god well anyway eddie from youtube</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on blood thinners didn&rsquo;t say why he</p>
<p>wants to know if it&rsquo;s okay for him to</p>
<p>take b1 vitamins</p>
<p>yeah yeah</p>
<p>you just want to avoid the vitamin k1</p>
<p>but b1 is totally fine it doesn&rsquo;t create</p>
<p>a conflict</p>
<p>of um</p>
<p>coagulation or any type of thrombosis</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s encouraging okay well the</p>
<p>audience is at it again with almost</p>
<p>instantaneous</p>
<p>answers and the latest question we ask</p>
<p>a true false</p>
<p>phytoestrogens from plants can enlarge</p>
<p>the prostate and</p>
<p>our audience claims 85 percent of them</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true and 15</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>okay so i just released a video on this</p>
<p>obviously</p>
<p>80 percent of the people did not watch</p>
<p>the video that&rsquo;s fine because it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>men but there&rsquo;s three types of estrogen</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s three types you got uh</p>
<p>type one two and three okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only the type two estrogen</p>
<p>called e2 that can enlarge the prostate</p>
<p>and the phytoestrogen</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>really only uh affects the the e1 it</p>
<p>gives you an e1 and it can actually</p>
<p>block</p>
<p>the receptor for e2 so then other</p>
<p>estrogens</p>
<p>that can enlarge the prostate can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>in there</p>
<p>so the good news is that phytoestrogens</p>
<p>plant-based estrogens</p>
<p>cannot</p>
<p>have the ability do not have the ability</p>
<p>to enlarge the prostate which is good</p>
<p>news they can actually help reduce the</p>
<p>size of the prostate even though they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a type of estrogen but not the type that</p>
<p>will cause it to be enlarged so</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re weaker estrogens that have a</p>
<p>different effect on the body&rsquo;s body so</p>
<p>they only affect the good ones and not</p>
<p>the bad ones</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s encouraging nadine is</p>
<p>waiting in the green room</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to unmute her and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a</p>
<p>fascinating question i&rsquo;m sure for you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air with dr berg nadine</p>
<p>hi dr bird thank you</p>
<p>um my question is i have pediatricians</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with kidney stones</p>
<p>and other livers</p>
<p>and i more than likely have insulin</p>
<p>resistance so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>have been on a keto diet before</p>
<p>um and i stopped because i got the</p>
<p>diagnosis of kidney stones so i&rsquo;m at the</p>
<p>point now where i&rsquo;m afraid to go back</p>
<p>onto a keto diet because of the kidney</p>
<p>stones</p>
<p>and i would like to help to figure out</p>
<p>what i did wrong</p>
<p>i did not at that time do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting because i didn&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>but i had to clean up my diet since</p>
<p>i was i found out i was celiac um about</p>
<p>10 years ago</p>
<p>um but now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>worried that i&rsquo;m going to get kidney</p>
<p>stones again because of the</p>
<p>the amount of vegetables and</p>
<p>green</p>
<p>vegetables basically have high oxygen</p>
<p>i have some good news for you</p>
<p>i have some very good news for you</p>
<p>um yeah you&rsquo;re right um the most common</p>
<p>uh type of stone is an oxlet stone</p>
<p>and the oxy stones are made from calcium</p>
<p>oxalate and you get oxalates from</p>
<p>foods that are really common on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet like spinach</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and almonds</p>
<p>and things like that so</p>
<p>how do you</p>
<p>counter this problem well</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t eat those foods high in ox</p>
<p>foods and i have videos on that</p>
<p>specifically</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something else you can do to</p>
<p>really make sure you don&rsquo;t develop any</p>
<p>more stones and that would be</p>
<p>just every single day</p>
<p>you measure out</p>
<p>two and a half liters of of water</p>
<p>fluid and you just make sure you consume</p>
<p>that during the day because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way you can develop a kidney stone if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>have that much fluid going through your</p>
<p>kidneys because kidney stones develop</p>
<p>when you have a super concentrated</p>
<p>uh form of these calcium oxalates</p>
<p>so just the water alone will keep things</p>
<p>diluted enough so you never develop a</p>
<p>kidney stone</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and then on top of avoiding those um</p>
<p>those foods you&rsquo;re going to be a good in</p>
<p>shape and then if you add</p>
<p>if you watch my video on blending a</p>
<p>whole lemon with some of that water</p>
<p>with a little bit my electrolytes</p>
<p>because it has potassium citrate</p>
<p>so the citrate from the lemons the</p>
<p>citrate from the electrolytes together</p>
<p>that will bind with any oxalates that</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>high in your in your urine and</p>
<p>and even in your blood and so that will</p>
<p>help you</p>
<p>reduce the risk so those factors right</p>
<p>there and because here&rsquo;s the thing the</p>
<p>benefits of doing keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for all these other conditions</p>
<p>oh my gosh it&rsquo;s so important for you to</p>
<p>do that right now um</p>
<p>but just that water alone two and a half</p>
<p>liters of water a day just figure out</p>
<p>what that is</p>
<p>and i think this might be 12 cups</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get a kidney stone</p>
<p>and then the other thing too um</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>the fasting with this ketogenic diet</p>
<p>will um</p>
<p>help your gut</p>
<p>help your celiac</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you the only thing is you may have</p>
<p>potentially some issues if you have too</p>
<p>much vegetable if you start getting</p>
<p>bloating then we know okay so maybe you</p>
<p>need to cut down on that but um i would</p>
<p>try to do it just like i recommend and</p>
<p>maybe instead of spinach you just do</p>
<p>other types of lettuce which are low on</p>
<p>oxalates</p>
<p>okay thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>one good salad</p>
<p>that i like for uh just in general is</p>
<p>arugula i eat a lot of arugula i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>growing it right now</p>
<p>and arugula is low in oxlets</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it really takes it has additional</p>
<p>benefits that go beyond just other</p>
<p>lettuce because it&rsquo;s a cruciferous so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for the liver</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s slightly spicy</p>
<p>yum yum so nadine</p>
<p>i think you got some great direction</p>
<p>there and we wish you all the best</p>
<p>in your future pursuits of health and by</p>
<p>the way on our social media you know we</p>
<p>get tons of questions and we take</p>
<p>questions first because we think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important for you all to get some</p>
<p>answers but there is no shortage of</p>
<p>success stories and comments that are</p>
<p>favorable to dr berg and here&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>them karen from facebook i was</p>
<p>pre-diabetic until i found your videos</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m within the normal range for</p>
<p>blood sugars for two months now thank</p>
<p>you dr berg so we love to hear that and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no shortage of that at all on</p>
<p>social media at media excuse me and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no shortage of questions this</p>
<p>week so why don&rsquo;t we go out with the</p>
<p>next one</p>
<p>great okay so</p>
<p>the peak of nutrition in plants occurs</p>
<p>at what stage in the growing cycle</p>
<p>and get on it audience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see now um</p>
<p>lilia from facebook when i take gaba or</p>
<p>alpha lipoic acid i get shortness of</p>
<p>breath and a burning brain sensation uh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there doc</p>
<p>it could be the source of that</p>
<p>ingredient um or it could be the amounts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very powerful antioxidant too so</p>
<p>it has that effect</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s made synthetically</p>
<p>a lot of these antioxidants create</p>
<p>irritation to the body</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you take a look at the studies on</p>
<p>antioxidants they&rsquo;ll say wow it causes</p>
<p>cancer it causes this problem</p>
<p>like really antioxidants but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use them from nature they don&rsquo;t test</p>
<p>them from nature they&rsquo;re touching</p>
<p>testing it from a lab so i would try a</p>
<p>different source</p>
<p>a higher quality source to see if that</p>
<p>helps you</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well by the way we</p>
<p>just had um i forget the guy&rsquo;s name but</p>
<p>on youtube he said he&rsquo;s really eager to</p>
<p>hear about your farming experience</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve piqued our interest dr berg in</p>
<p>fact last week you talked about some</p>
<p>gadget you can stick inside and grow</p>
<p>tomatoes and so on but we&rsquo;re all trying</p>
<p>to get healthy with that so we&rsquo;d love do</p>
<p>you have a video on that yet don</p>
<p>not yet because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>it takes a while to grow all this stuff</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a fascinating experience right</p>
<p>now because uh we&rsquo;re growing all sorts</p>
<p>of things we&rsquo;re measuring the</p>
<p>phytonutrients so</p>
<p>stay tuned i mean even today we just set</p>
<p>up um</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re growing barley sprouts</p>
<p>for um</p>
<p>the animal feed</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>we were installing that whole unit right</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s going to be pretty</p>
<p>exciting so i&rsquo;m going to video this</p>
<p>whole process so you know whether a</p>
<p>person is doing homesteading or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having a garden</p>
<p>um i have some really great information</p>
<p>for you especially even</p>
<p>better ways to feed animals that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way more nutrition and</p>
<p>and we have pretty much</p>
<p>all the variety of animals</p>
<p>and uh it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>one of my favorite research projects on</p>
<p>just testing that as well as the soil i</p>
<p>have some amazing data that</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>that you probably have a hard time</p>
<p>finding</p>
<p>when you google it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know your your your health comes</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>the health of an animal or a plant and</p>
<p>that comes from the health of the soil</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really about the soil</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some fascinating data about</p>
<p>that and we&rsquo;re also split testing that</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>with other types of growing methods</p>
<p>that go even go beyond hydroponic we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>testing aeroponic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>both high pressure and low pressure to</p>
<p>be able to</p>
<p>create a mist instead of soaking the</p>
<p>roots into the soil and then adding</p>
<p>the typical things that they use enough</p>
<p>to fortify these plants versus another</p>
<p>super nutrient type</p>
<p>mixture that just goes way beyond what</p>
<p>most people do and we&rsquo;re going to do the</p>
<p>testing with the plants and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to give you all the information so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>just guess or try things uh i can show</p>
<p>you what works what doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll be a</p>
<p>similar channel to what i have now but</p>
<p>just all about</p>
<p>growing your own food and um</p>
<p>which i highly recommend you do and once</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go back like i can&rsquo;t go i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go to the grocery store and buy a</p>
<p>salad anymore when i</p>
<p>get it from my greenhouse i&rsquo;ll go to the</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market but i&rsquo;m spoiled steve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the drawback</p>
<p>wow but it&rsquo;s so much healthier it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>um significantly</p>
<p>more healthier so yeah so stay tuned for</p>
<p>more information on that sounds great</p>
<p>and my life&rsquo;s much more simple i just</p>
<p>crank open a can of many raviolis blast</p>
<p>it in the microwave and then feel sick</p>
<p>for two or three hours afterwards so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my hey that&rsquo;s what i did in</p>
<p>college steve yeah i lived on canned</p>
<p>food now i&rsquo;ve been being much better i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be lying to say that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever have that sort of thing but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t serve me real well okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see so</p>
<p>uh this is a heartbreaking condition</p>
<p>jessica from youtube is suffering from</p>
<p>psoriasis from my head to my feet for</p>
<p>five years now can you please give me</p>
<p>some advice how to address this</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>well the first thing is you got to get</p>
<p>on keto intermittent fasting number one</p>
<p>you have to and you have to start taking</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually vitamin d creams that</p>
<p>you can get that you can put topically</p>
<p>as well and</p>
<p>you need also i would try um</p>
<p>near infrared light therapy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other types of light therapy</p>
<p>which is actually a fascinating research</p>
<p>for psoriasis</p>
<p>and on top of all those things</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cream</p>
<p>that i recommend</p>
<p>and yes it is a chinese herbal cream</p>
<p>that some people have concerns because</p>
<p>sometimes they might put steroids in it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i paid a lot of money to send that cream</p>
<p>to a lab to test if there was some added</p>
<p>steroid creams and there wasn&rsquo;t so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m recommending it now for people with</p>
<p>psoriasis because it&rsquo;s one of the uh</p>
<p>only remedies that creates the dramatic</p>
<p>effect and so you have to find my video</p>
<p>because i do have a link and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>affiliated with this company though but</p>
<p>um they have a good cream that you can</p>
<p>topically put on your body there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain herbs</p>
<p>that mimic cortisol</p>
<p>without the side effects</p>
<p>so just search on my video on</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>might be</p>
<p>psoriasis or dermal psoriasis or skin</p>
<p>psoriasis or</p>
<p>scalp psoriasis it&rsquo;s one of those videos</p>
<p>and i actually have the remedy</p>
<p>in the description</p>
<p>boy that&rsquo;s really great and all those</p>
<p>videos are free on drburg.com so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thousands of them so surely there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>answers uh</p>
<p>lingering in there somewhere</p>
<p>the advantage of going to doctorberg.com</p>
<p>for for the videos because you can</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on youtube but</p>
<p>on youtube you can&rsquo;t find them</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find them the indexing is</p>
<p>terrible so when you go to drb com</p>
<p>everything is categorized so you type in</p>
<p>a subject and you find it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been a challenge since i think</p>
<p>last october</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even find certain videos that i</p>
<p>did on certain topics so that is the</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>if you type uh let&rsquo;s say psoriasis and</p>
<p>dr berg and then you can&rsquo;t find it and</p>
<p>then you you have to scroll down like</p>
<p>maybe a hundred videos to find it so</p>
<p>go to drburg.com</p>
<p>and that way you can go into blog and i</p>
<p>have all the videos right there</p>
<p>index easily to find that information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great dr berg.com so here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>uh we&rsquo;re going to pop out the next quiz</p>
<p>question then go to umar from facebook</p>
<p>and then to diana in our green room this</p>
<p>is an exciting few minutes coming up and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the next question</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the answer first to the question</p>
<p>oh uh let&rsquo;s see uh this is a new</p>
<p>question i think we&rsquo;ve answered all the</p>
<p>other ones haven&rsquo;t we no that&rsquo;s this is</p>
<p>not a new one this is a</p>
<p>an existing one we asked everyone just</p>
<p>moments ago oh dear forgive me all right</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s go to our social media while</p>
<p>i sort that out umar from facebook why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t it sounds like it&rsquo;s a little fussy</p>
<p>with you doctor why can&rsquo;t we take</p>
<p>protein powders while fasting</p>
<p>well because protein stimulates insulin</p>
<p>not as much as carbs but it will</p>
<p>and that will knock you out of the</p>
<p>ballpark with fast with ketosis so</p>
<p>protein powders are very</p>
<p>bad when you fast</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re low fat that&rsquo;s what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like about them</p>
<p>um but if you really wanted to take a</p>
<p>protein powder take it when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating not</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to be fasting</p>
<p>anymore well that sounds great well at</p>
<p>least terry our producer is organized</p>
<p>and he already has the answers for what</p>
<p>we already asked and it asks the peak of</p>
<p>nutrition in plants occurs at which</p>
<p>stage</p>
<p>and our audience also realized that the</p>
<p>question been answered</p>
<p>asked because they answered it 75</p>
<p>percent of respondents say the sprout or</p>
<p>beginning stages 15 say the ripening</p>
<p>station 10 percent say fully mature</p>
<p>stage</p>
<p>okay so when you have a seed which is as</p>
<p>a fascinating</p>
<p>amazing miraculous thing this seed the</p>
<p>seed has all the programs the blueprints</p>
<p>for this plant</p>
<p>and when you germinate it you put in</p>
<p>soil add water</p>
<p>or not put in the soil just add water it</p>
<p>starts to germinate starts to sprout</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and it sprouts</p>
<p>maybe um like between one and seven days</p>
<p>so all the nutrition is not coming from</p>
<p>the sun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming from the co2</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming from the water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only coming from the seed and so</p>
<p>that seed is giving it all the energy to</p>
<p>grow for seven days now after seven days</p>
<p>nutrition beeps down it goes down</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no more nutrition or</p>
<p>energy in the seed it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>gave everything it needed so the purpose</p>
<p>of that seed is to</p>
<p>make sure the survival of that sprout</p>
<p>exists that baby little</p>
<p>plant and so the peak nutrition</p>
<p>actually occurs</p>
<p>for survival reasons</p>
<p>right in the very beginning stages in</p>
<p>the sprouting</p>
<p>uh stages</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like sprouted broccoli seeds</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i like 50 times</p>
<p>the amount of sulforaphane than adult</p>
<p>broccoli</p>
<p>so these phytonutrients</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>are max i mean maxed out in those early</p>
<p>stages and this is why we</p>
<p>were doing the um it&rsquo;s called fodder but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sprouted barley</p>
<p>sprouts for the cattle and the pigs and</p>
<p>the turkeys and the sheeps and the</p>
<p>all these uh and the chickens everyone</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sprouting it and we don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>very much we don&rsquo;t even need light</p>
<p>so we take the sprouted we give it to</p>
<p>them they have all these phytonutrients</p>
<p>all this nutrition and it comes from the</p>
<p>seeds so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a miracle</p>
<p>type thing that occurs but that&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>is one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to add sprouts to your</p>
<p>salad</p>
<p>um as a preventative thing for cancer to</p>
<p>uh many different things but um</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t neglect the sprout steve okay</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t and this uh this tells us that</p>
<p>75 percent of our respondents are very</p>
<p>smart and the rest are enthusiastic so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great report and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s kick off the last question and i</p>
<p>promise to remember it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>is you know fruit is natural it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>nature why isn&rsquo;t it healthy to eat</p>
<p>despite</p>
<p>you know having some carbs i mean</p>
<p>yeah we understand about the carb thing</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s from nature</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t we we be eating things from</p>
<p>nature because it&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>well that makes sense to me dr berg and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>diana in ontario canada our first sort</p>
<p>of international uh respondent from the</p>
<p>green room diana you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>hi dr berg greetings from the north very</p>
<p>nice meeting you</p>
<p>i am 50 something</p>
<p>working from home lack of activities and</p>
<p>menopause caused weight gain for me uh</p>
<p>and weight gain made me feel bloated</p>
<p>miserable</p>
<p>bad mood and low</p>
<p>low self-esteem</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve tried dieting before to no avail</p>
<p>but i and i have heard about</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>and this past december during christmas</p>
<p>break i came across your videos</p>
<p>and you came into my life at the right</p>
<p>time your explanations were very easy</p>
<p>and simple to understand and made a lot</p>
<p>of sense</p>
<p>so i decided to follow your advice and</p>
<p>started applying them in the first week</p>
<p>of january</p>
<p>and the main thing that resonated with</p>
<p>me was when you said do not eat when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry because i realized i</p>
<p>was eating even when i wasn&rsquo;t hungry</p>
<p>so i have lost more than 20 pounds in</p>
<p>the last four weeks</p>
<p>from intermittent fasting and keto diet</p>
<p>and moderate exercise</p>
<p>so thank you</p>
<p>from the bottom of my heart</p>
<p>for the knowledge and i&rsquo;ve shared all</p>
<p>the videos as well with my friends and</p>
<p>family</p>
<p>recently i&rsquo;ve had a routine blood work</p>
<p>and okay the results came back excellent</p>
<p>i was pre-diabetic and now i have a</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>sugar level</p>
<p>cholesterol was also really really good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the first time that i saw</p>
<p>ketone level in my blood</p>
<p>blood work</p>
<p>and so it seems like i&rsquo;ve successfully</p>
<p>put myself in a keto in ketosis</p>
<p>and i apologize if you&rsquo;ve already had a</p>
<p>video on this but my question is how</p>
<p>long can i safely be in a state of</p>
<p>ketosis</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>you know people people look at uh</p>
<p>ketones as an alternative fuel</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an alternative fuel to glucose</p>
<p>the the deeper truth of that is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an alternative</p>
<p>fuel source it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the original</p>
<p>fuel fuel source that our bodies ran on</p>
<p>for a very very long time in the</p>
<p>evolution of creating these bodies</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>um all you can eat buffets back then we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have food</p>
<p>regularly for our bodies sometimes we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even eat for a whole day or two</p>
<p>days or three days</p>
<p>so what do we have to survive on ketones</p>
<p>so ketones</p>
<p>our bodies are really used too</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>to run on ketones it&rsquo;s very natural it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very unnatural to run on glucose</p>
<p>only only until recently</p>
<p>probably the last 40 years have we</p>
<p>really got out of control with that</p>
<p>so um that you can</p>
<p>be on ketosis</p>
<p>your whole life</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i recommend</p>
<p>even a baby starts out on ketosis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people have flipped it where well their</p>
<p>bodies our brains run on glucose so then</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s natural and yes it can run</p>
<p>in ketones as an alternative</p>
<p>now our bodies do very well</p>
<p>if they run on ketones and they don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>very well if they do on</p>
<p>sugar so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to go back to the glucose</p>
<p>way of living because it has</p>
<p>some minor complications like diabetes</p>
<p>fatty liver and cancer and arthritis but</p>
<p>other than that it&rsquo;s perfectly fine</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great listen we do have the</p>
<p>answer to the final question but we have</p>
<p>if we have to extend things we have</p>
<p>a rodna from north carolina we&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>little issue with her video so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>if we can bring her up now rodney if you</p>
<p>can hear us</p>
<p>we you are on with dr byrd</p>
<p>thank you dr berg for this opportunity</p>
<p>i love your channel and especially the</p>
<p>um all the delicious keto friendly</p>
<p>recipes you make i myself love cooking</p>
<p>and i do mostly indian style cooking and</p>
<p>watching your videos</p>
<p>me to make recipes uh that are</p>
<p>traditional like chicken tikka masala</p>
<p>and tandoori chicken</p>
<p>all keto friendly because in the</p>
<p>restaurants they add sugar to the</p>
<p>chicken tikka masala</p>
<p>and i have done that without the sugar</p>
<p>or adding any coat of</p>
<p>bread or layers so um this is really</p>
<p>truly helpful so thank you so so much</p>
<p>for that</p>
<p>and i recently made</p>
<p>some lemon and mixed vegetable pickle</p>
<p>and i used some olive oil some spices to</p>
<p>ferment it</p>
<p>my question is is it keto friendly and</p>
<p>how often can i</p>
<p>eat them um also</p>
<p>making some pancakes with thick pea</p>
<p>flour is that keto friendly</p>
<p>i think the the fermented product is</p>
<p>with lemons and</p>
<p>what else what else is in there</p>
<p>so i used lemons and ginger and red</p>
<p>whole spice which were dried in the sun</p>
<p>before i uh put them in the pickle um</p>
<p>made them into pickle with olive oil and</p>
<p>spices and the other</p>
<p>pickle that i used</p>
<p>vegetable which had cauliflower carrots</p>
<p>cucumbers</p>
<p>and some zucchini</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re making me hungry so</p>
<p>yes those can be eaten on a regular</p>
<p>basis there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with those</p>
<p>at all</p>
<p>as far as the pea flower</p>
<p>there are certain types of</p>
<p>new flower alternatives that</p>
<p>are okay</p>
<p>i will say pea flower is a little bit</p>
<p>higher it&rsquo;s better than wheat</p>
<p>but it is a it really depends on the</p>
<p>carbs so i would have to measure it</p>
<p>and look at the carbs per serving to see</p>
<p>how much you can get away with</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do with that</p>
<p>but i will agree with you</p>
<p>my favorite food is indian food if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to eliminate the sugar</p>
<p>which there is</p>
<p>and then have all these spices that just</p>
<p>give it an incredible explosion i went</p>
<p>to um a restaurant in new york with my</p>
<p>wife a long time ago</p>
<p>before quito and we went to an uh indian</p>
<p>restaurant and i swear we could not talk</p>
<p>to each other for an hour because</p>
<p>things are going on like flavors and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening this is amazing and um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it definitely um</p>
<p>gives you a lot of pleasure and</p>
<p>but it comes to the package if you just</p>
<p>eliminate the sugar</p>
<p>i mean think about what will happen you</p>
<p>can get the health</p>
<p>and you can eat have your cake and eat</p>
<p>it too</p>
<p>that is so great thank you well i feel</p>
<p>so guilty i was picking on india for</p>
<p>making me fat a little earlier but now</p>
<p>aradna is so nice i i take all that back</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m glad that we were able to get to</p>
<p>you rodna thanks for joining us and then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get to our final quiz</p>
<p>question and answer if fruit is natural</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t healthy to eat despite</p>
<p>having carbs and the astute audience 95</p>
<p>say that it has high fructose levels</p>
<p>which spikes the insulin and 5</p>
<p>say that pesticides could be a factor</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re all right</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>the thing with the fruit is most of the</p>
<p>fruit that you see at the store is</p>
<p>hybrid in other words it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>manipulated over time fairly recently in</p>
<p>the scheme of things</p>
<p>the wild type of banana and the wild</p>
<p>type of</p>
<p>corn was completely different so we bred</p>
<p>our fruits for a much higher</p>
<p>concentration of</p>
<p>sugar content like we have indigenous</p>
<p>grapes um on my farm</p>
<p>we also have indigenous apples and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sweet they&rsquo;re not sweet at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so the point is that um</p>
<p>the hybrid the breeding them for</p>
<p>carbohydrate and this is why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem um</p>
<p>especially like the apple crisp and all</p>
<p>these apples that i mean just like so</p>
<p>much sugar so this is even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>natural it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>changed over time unfortunately on that</p>
<p>note</p>
<p>stay tuned for some wonderful new</p>
<p>information um coming up this next week</p>
<p>and definitely next friday i appreciate</p>
<p>all of you listening in and your</p>
<p>wonderful comments i read a lot of them</p>
<p>have a great weekend and i will see you</p>
<p>next week</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
