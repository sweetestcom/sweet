    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 27, Broken Empire and Fractured Languages.</p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;re going to look at the final years of the Western Roman Empire and the</p>
<p>rise of new Germanic kingdoms in its place.</p>
<p>And these political events coincided with the division of Latin and the Germanic languages</p>
<p>into new dialects and languages.</p>
<p>And these newly emerging languages evolved into many of the languages of modern Western</p>
<p>Europe, including English.</p>
<p>But before we begin, let me mention a couple of things about the podcast.</p>
<p>A couple of listeners have contacted me and indicated that they&rsquo;re having problems downloading</p>
<p>the episodes to their iPhone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why this is happening, but I wanted to give you a couple of options</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having this problem.</p>
<p>First, you can always go to the main website for the podcast, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Most of the episodes there, and especially the most recent episodes, are saved to a different</p>
<p>server.</p>
<p>So you should be able to listen there without any problem.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a separate website for the podcast, and that&rsquo;s historyofenglishpodcast.podbean.com.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s P-O-D-B-E-A-N dot com.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the main episodes are hosted, and that&rsquo;s what iTunes uses as well.</p>
<p>Well, if you go to that website, there&rsquo;s a link on the main page that says mobile.</p>
<p>And if you click that link, you can actually add an app to your iPhone for the podcast.</p>
<p>So be sure to check that out if you listen to the podcast with an iPhone.</p>
<p>So with all of that out of the way, let&rsquo;s turn to this episode.</p>
<p>And I should note that there&rsquo;s a lot of late Roman history in this episode.</p>
<p>But I wanted to go through the events which culminated in the collapse of the Western</p>
<p>Roman Empire, because they really set the stage for everything that happened later,</p>
<p>including the Anglo-Saxon migrations to Britain.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ve already started to look at the gradual decline of the Roman Empire</p>
<p>over the past few episodes.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve seen, there was no single cause for this decline.</p>
<p>It was a combination of infighting, civil war, economic disruptions, and external pressures</p>
<p>from across the borders.</p>
<p>All of these factors contributed to the decline of the empire in the West.</p>
<p>And at the same time that the Roman power was declining, the Germanic tribes were becoming</p>
<p>more powerful.</p>
<p>And some of those tribes were also beginning to learn how to read and write.</p>
<p>First there was those Germanic runes, then the Gothic translation of the Bible.</p>
<p>But literacy was still very, very rare within Germania.</p>
<p>But as we know, literacy was very common across the border in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The Greeks had been writing with their alphabet since around the year 800 BC.</p>
<p>And the Romans had been writing with their version of the same alphabet since about 600 BC.</p>
<p>So by this point, writing had been in common use throughout much of the Roman Empire for</p>
<p>around a thousand years.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even counting the earlier forms of writing like cuneiform and hieroglyphics,</p>
<p>which had been around for even longer in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>There are so many different ways to look at the conflicts between the Romans and the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes, but we sometimes forget that it was a conflict between a literate world and an</p>
<p>illiterate world.</p>
<p>And when we look back at the history of that type of conflict, the literate world has a</p>
<p>major advantage.</p>
<p>They get to write the history for later generations to read.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why so many historians of the past lamented the collapse</p>
<p>of the Roman Empire, and they described the period that followed as the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>These historians made the mistake of equating writing with civilization.</p>
<p>So when writing began to decline after the fall of Rome, that must have meant that civilization</p>
<p>itself had declined, and a dark period of barbarian rule must have been ushered in.</p>
<p>Again, we know today that many of those assumptions were false, or at least greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>But it illustrates how important writing is to our view of history, and especially the</p>
<p>events during this period.</p>
<p>So I want to begin this episode by taking a look at the state of literacy and writing</p>
<p>within the Roman Empire as we enter the last century of its existence.</p>
<p>And during this period, around the end of the 4th century, a significant event related</p>
<p>to writing was taking place, and that event was the replacement of scrolls with books.</p>
<p>Up to this point, people generally used papyrus scrolls or parchment for writing.</p>
<p>The Romans also sometimes used waxed-covered tablets.</p>
<p>But the Romans had figured out a way to tie several tablets together at the side, so you</p>
<p>could flip from one tablet to the next.</p>
<p>By the time of Tacitus at the end of the 1st century, the Romans had started to take several</p>
<p>pieces of papyrus or parchment and bind them together in an early version of what we would</p>
<p>call a book today.</p>
<p>By the 4th century, these early books had largely replaced scrolls.</p>
<p>So why did that happen, and why did it happen at this point?</p>
<p>Well, for centuries, papyrus had been one of the most common materials used for writing.</p>
<p>The process for making papyrus for writing involved cutting strips of the papyrus plant</p>
<p>and laying them side-by-side horizontally, and then adding a second layer on top vertically,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>When it was thick enough, it was pressed and left to dry.</p>
<p>And this dried-out papyrus was rolled into scrolls.</p>
<p>When we see references to ancient books from the Mediterranean, this is what we&rsquo;re referring</p>
<p>to, papyrus scrolls, not books as we know them today.</p>
<p>But as the Roman Empire began to fracture and fall apart, it became increasingly difficult</p>
<p>for people in Europe to obtain papyrus from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So they began to switch to parchment, which was typically made from calf or sheepskin,</p>
<p>but sometimes the skin of other animals as well.</p>
<p>Parchment had actually been around for centuries, but only now did it start to replace papyrus</p>
<p>as the dominant writing material.</p>
<p>Parchment was smoother than papyrus.</p>
<p>It was also thin, durable, and flexible.</p>
<p>It was also much easier to bind pages of parchment together than it was for papyrus.</p>
<p>But parchment was also very expensive, because it was made from animal skins, and therefore</p>
<p>there was a much more limited supply of it.</p>
<p>The finest quality of parchment was called vellum, because it came from a calf skin.</p>
<p>The word vellum comes from an older Latin word, vel, which meant calf, and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same root word that gives us the word veal in modern English, also meaning calf, usually</p>
<p>one that you have for dinner.</p>
<p>Now even though parchment was expensive, at least there were animals around which could</p>
<p>be used to make it.</p>
<p>Since it was becoming almost impossible to import papyrus into Europe with the decline</p>
<p>of Rome, parchment was the only practical alternative.</p>
<p>So parchment gradually replaced papyrus.</p>
<p>And with the shift from papyrus to parchment, another shift occurred.</p>
<p>And that was the shift from scrolls to individual pages bound together into a book form.</p>
<p>But the Romans didn&rsquo;t call this bound collection of pages a book.</p>
<p>They called it a codex.</p>
<p>The popularity of these very early books quickly became apparent.</p>
<p>It was much easier to read a book than a rolled up piece of papyrus, especially for longer</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>Books could also be printed on both sides of the page, whereas papyrus could only be</p>
<p>printed on one side since it was rolled up and had to be handled on one side.</p>
<p>With a book, you could simply flip through the pages rather than trying to manage a series</p>
<p>of scrolls.</p>
<p>And Christian monks soon came to prefer this type of document since it was much easier</p>
<p>to read scriptures in a book form than in a long scroll.</p>
<p>At this point, all documents, both scrolls and books, were handwritten.</p>
<p>And as the Roman Empire fell apart, the art and skill of writing became increasingly confined</p>
<p>to monks and monasteries.</p>
<p>So most writing tended to be religious in nature.</p>
<p>And since these monks came to prefer books over scrolls, well, scrolls were quickly phased</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>In fact, the oldest surviving complete book in Greek is a Greek version of the Bible from</p>
<p>this very time frame, the 4th century.</p>
<p>As I noted, the Romans called these bound collections a codex.</p>
<p>That word had evolved from the Latin word codix, which meant tree trunk, which raises</p>
<p>an interesting question.</p>
<p>If these early books were made from parchment, animal skins, why did the Romans name them</p>
<p>after the word for tree trunk?</p>
<p>Well, remember that the early Romans used wooden tablets covered with wax for writing</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>And remember that the first version of a book, a codex, was several of these wooden tablets</p>
<p>which were tied together at the side.</p>
<p>So the Latin word for tree trunk was used for these early books because the pages, if</p>
<p>we can call them that, were literally pieces of wood.</p>
<p>The name stuck even as the technology later evolved to parchment.</p>
<p>Now within later French, the word codex came to refer to a specific type of book, a law</p>
<p>book.</p>
<p>As written laws were gradually adopted, the written collection of laws was called a codex.</p>
<p>And from there, we got the word code, as in legal code, or tax code, or dress code.</p>
<p>By the way, the term codicil also came from this same root word.</p>
<p>Codicil refers to an amendment to a document, usually a last will and testament, and it</p>
<p>originally meant a small writing tablet.</p>
<p>But it then came to mean a short or abbreviated writing, and later came to mean a short amendment</p>
<p>tacked on to an original document.</p>
<p>Both code and codicil came into English from French after the Norman invasion in 1066,</p>
<p>and as we&rsquo;ll see when we get to that period, the Normans had to impose law and order on</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So most of the legal terms in modern English came from that period of French.</p>
<p>And of course, most of those French words originated in Latin.</p>
<p>So the Latin word codex came from an earlier Latin word for tree trunk.</p>
<p>Well guess what?</p>
<p>Our Germanic word book has a similar origin.</p>
<p>The English word book comes from an original Germanic word, bach, which is actually cognate</p>
<p>with the word beach, as in beach tree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believed that the first Germanic tribes carved runes onto beech wood, and they may</p>
<p>have also carved runes into actual living beech trees.</p>
<p>And this seems to be the source of the word bach, meaning something you write on.</p>
<p>In Old English, the term bach meant any written document.</p>
<p>It later took the meaning of book as we know it today.</p>
<p>So speaking of writing materials that come from trees, you may be wondering why I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mentioned paper yet.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s because paper technology hadn&rsquo;t found its way to Europe yet.</p>
<p>In fact, it would be several more centuries before Europeans began to write on paper.</p>
<p>But the knowledge and technology required to make paper did exist at this point in the</p>
<p>fourth and fifth centuries.</p>
<p>It just happened to exist far to the east in China.</p>
<p>The process of making paper is a lot more complicated than making papyrus scrolls.</p>
<p>Paper is made by breaking down plants into individual fibers, and then through a process</p>
<p>of wetting and drying, the fibers bond together to form an entirely new substance, paper,</p>
<p>which can be very thin and very smooth.</p>
<p>It has characteristics that are similar to parchment, but it doesn&rsquo;t come from animal</p>
<p>skins.</p>
<p>It comes from trees and other plants.</p>
<p>So it can be produced in abundance.</p>
<p>And that meant that when paper technology was introduced, it was much cheaper than parchment.</p>
<p>And eventually, paper replaced parchment, even in Europe.</p>
<p>But it took many centuries for that technology to spread westward from China to Western Europe.</p>
<p>But interestingly, there was something else spreading from China to Western Europe during</p>
<p>this same time frame.</p>
<p>Or maybe I should say, someone else was spreading from China to Europe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m referring to the Huns.</p>
<p>And since the Huns were so skilled on horseback, they beat the arrival of paper in Europe by</p>
<p>several centuries.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the arrival of the Huns into Europe that served as the catalyst for many</p>
<p>of the events which led to the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And the Huns brought with them some technological innovations of their own.</p>
<p>And their technology is also part of this story.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention to the Huns and the events which followed their arrival in</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And to understand the Huns, we should probably think back to the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Because like the first Indo-Europeans, the Huns were nomadic people who lived in the</p>
<p>Eurasian steppe region.</p>
<p>Their overall lifestyle was actually very similar to those first Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>They were nomadic, they were very skilled on horseback, they were proficient at raiding,</p>
<p>they were warlike at times, and they were constantly on the move looking for new regions</p>
<p>to settle in and conquer if necessary.</p>
<p>But I should note that the Huns were not Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now about 3,000 years beyond the period in which the original Indo-Europeans lived.</p>
<p>And the Huns spoke a completely different language.</p>
<p>But culturally, not much had changed on the Eurasian steppes over the centuries.</p>
<p>So as we look at the expansion of the Huns, we can draw some parallels with the expansion</p>
<p>of the Indo-Europeans from the same region about 3,000 years earlier.</p>
<p>Now the Huns, and for that matter the original Indo-Europeans, they were not unique.</p>
<p>The steppe region was home to many powerful nomadic tribes over the centuries.</p>
<p>In fact, as late as the 13th century, we have the rise of the Mongol Empire under Genghis</p>
<p>Khan, which originated in the same region.</p>
<p>And that empire would eventually include much of modern China and stretch westward all the</p>
<p>way into Eastern Europe, making it the largest empire the world has ever known in terms of</p>
<p>contiguous landmass.</p>
<p>So the peoples of the steppe region were a constant threat throughout much of human history,</p>
<p>really until the rise of modern nation-states with standing armies equipped with gunpowder.</p>
<p>Until then, though, the nomadic tribes of the steppes were a never-ending problem for</p>
<p>people who lived in adjacent areas, and that included not only the people of Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>it also included the early Chinese kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century BC, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty in China began the construction</p>
<p>of a huge wall to protect themselves from nomadic tribes from the steppe region.</p>
<p>Of course, we know the wall today as the Great Wall of China, and it had mixed success against</p>
<p>those tribes.</p>
<p>But over time, the steppe tribes found it increasingly difficult to penetrate the wall,</p>
<p>and they began to turn westward.</p>
<p>They moved westward across the steppes until they finally found themselves in the western</p>
<p>steppe region in the 4th century.</p>
<p>That put them in the area north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>And those people came to be known as the Huni by the Romans, and of course we know them</p>
<p>today as the Huns.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another interesting parallel between the Huns and the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>As we know, small technological innovations gave the Indo-Europeans huge advantages relative</p>
<p>to their neighbors.</p>
<p>So horse domestication and dairy farming, wheeled wagons and horse riding, all of these</p>
<p>innovations gave the original Indo-Europeans an advantage which they exploited over time.</p>
<p>Well, another technological innovation had been developed on the steppes, and the Huns</p>
<p>had mastered this little bit of technology.</p>
<p>And with it, the Huns became one of the most feared peoples from Asia all the way to Central</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And in fact, a compelling argument can be made that this little piece of technology</p>
<p>was indirectly responsible for the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west, and with</p>
<p>it the expansion of Germanic tribes into the region to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p>So in a way, it&rsquo;s ultimately responsible for the spread of Anglo-Saxons and their Old</p>
<p>English language into southern Britain.</p>
<p>And what was that little innovation?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it was the stirrup.</p>
<p>Now you may say, so what?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that horse riding was now very common.</p>
<p>So the fact that someone could ride a horse wasn&rsquo;t really a big deal anymore.</p>
<p>Even the Romans had a cavalry, but they relied on their foot soldiers, their infantry.</p>
<p>And over time, the Germanic tribes mimicked the Roman military strategies.</p>
<p>So the Germans also relied primarily on their infantry.</p>
<p>Now a cavalry was good for support, but part of the reason why the Europeans didn&rsquo;t generally</p>
<p>wage war on horseback is because they didn&rsquo;t have stirrups.</p>
<p>Without them, it was hard to brace yourself or support yourself on horseback.</p>
<p>So you had to avoid a sudden turn or sharp contact, because you&rsquo;d fall off.</p>
<p>So fighting on horseback against an infantry was limited.</p>
<p>But all of that changed once you had the stirrup.</p>
<p>Now you could brace yourself, and when necessary, you could literally stand up while riding.</p>
<p>You could shoot arrows with deadly aim.</p>
<p>And you could maneuver your horse in ways that were impossible before.</p>
<p>Once the Huns had mastered this technology, they would attack quickly, and they could</p>
<p>retreat just as quickly.</p>
<p>And sometimes, that sudden retreat would turn into another quick attack.</p>
<p>The Europeans had never experienced that kind of warfare before.</p>
<p>The stirrup had actually been developed a few centuries earlier in the steppe region.</p>
<p>And it began as a way to make it easier to mount a horse.</p>
<p>It was basically a loop which extended on one side of the horse, and it enabled the</p>
<p>rider to step into the loop and then pull himself up onto the saddle.</p>
<p>So it was like a step.</p>
<p>But over time, this innovation was added to both sides of the saddle.</p>
<p>And that was really the key for the use of the stirrup in warfare.</p>
<p>And the first archaeological evidence of the stirrup on both sides of the saddle comes</p>
<p>from a tomb in China which dates to the early part of the 4th century.</p>
<p>So the use of stirrups on both sides of the horse was a brand new innovation when the</p>
<p>Huns arrived in Eastern Europe a few decades later, late in the 4th century.</p>
<p>After arriving in the western steppe region, the Huns spread over southern Russia.</p>
<p>And they then turned southward, where they encountered the Goths, who had been living</p>
<p>in the region north of the Black Sea for about a century.</p>
<p>Remember that these were the Eastern Goths, the group which came to be known as the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p>And by this point, the Goths had become settled farmers in the region, but they were no match</p>
<p>for the powerful Huns and their cavalry.</p>
<p>When the Huns arrived from the east, they tore through the Ostrogothic kingdom, and</p>
<p>they quickly conquered it.</p>
<p>They actually slaughtered many of the Gothic people who were living in the region.</p>
<p>Some Goths fled, and some remained.</p>
<p>The ones that remained became part of a new Hunnic empire.</p>
<p>And many of those Goths ended up fighting with the Huns in later battles, including</p>
<p>battles several decades later under the Hunnic leader Attila.</p>
<p>But the ones who fled went in the only direction they could go, to the west.</p>
<p>And that set in motion a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Now you would think that the use of stirrups would have quickly spread to the Romans and</p>
<p>the Germans.</p>
<p>But it actually took a couple of centuries before Europeans began to realize the effectiveness</p>
<p>of the technology.</p>
<p>And by that point, the Western Roman Empire was long gone, and the feudal system was starting</p>
<p>to emerge.</p>
<p>And in fact, many historians believe that the adoption of stirrups by the Europeans</p>
<p>was an essential part of the development of the later feudal system, because the feudal</p>
<p>system relied heavily on knights in armor mounted on horseback.</p>
<p>And of course, that required stirrups.</p>
<p>But it appears that the first Romans and Germans to encounter the stirrup didn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>understand the full effectiveness of the technology.</p>
<p>Apparently, they only saw it as a way to help the rider mount the horse.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t fully understand how it could be used in warfare.</p>
<p>And part of the reason why we think the early Germans had this simplistic view of the technology</p>
<p>is based upon the word they created to describe it.</p>
<p>Stirrup is a Germanic word, and it&rsquo;s actually a combination of the early Germanic words</p>
<p>for stair, as in step, and rope.</p>
<p>And of course, we can still hear the roots of stair and rope in stirrup.</p>
<p>So they simply viewed the technology in its original use as a step to enable the rider</p>
<p>to get into the saddle.</p>
<p>And by the time they realized the full potential of the technology and began to use it themselves,</p>
<p>they were already overrun by the Huns by that point.</p>
<p>The one exception to this rule was the Goths, specifically the Visigoths in Dacia in southeastern</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>They had observed the destruction of their cousins to the east, the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p>And many of those Ostrogoths had fled into the Visigothic territory as refugees.</p>
<p>The Visigoths soon encountered the Huns on the eastern fringes of Dacia.</p>
<p>And apparently the Visigoths quickly realized two things.</p>
<p>First, stirrups gave the Huns a major advantage in battle.</p>
<p>And second, that there was no way they were going to defeat the Huns in warfare.</p>
<p>So they did two things in response.</p>
<p>They began using stirrups, and they asked the Romans if they could cross the Danube</p>
<p>into Roman territory to avoid annihilation by the Huns.</p>
<p>And both of those decisions ultimately changed the face of Western Europe.</p>
<p>The Romans were faced with a dilemma of their own.</p>
<p>Did they let the Visigoths into the empire, or did they refuse them entry and leave them</p>
<p>to be carved to pieces by the Huns?</p>
<p>As the Romans pondered this decision, a decision which would have major long-term implications,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to consider the situation in Rome since the death of Constantine about</p>
<p>40 years earlier.</p>
<p>Constantine had brought an end to the imperial crisis, which I discussed in the last episode.</p>
<p>And his reign provided a brief reprieve from the general decline of the empire in the West.</p>
<p>And when Constantine died in the year 337, new fighting broke out within the empire,</p>
<p>and new fighting broke out along the Rhine and Danube borders.</p>
<p>In the Rhine region, the Romans had some success in the middle part of the fourth century.</p>
<p>The Franks and the Alamanni were on the move again.</p>
<p>But the Romans scored some victories and fortified their defenses along the Rhine.</p>
<p>It was around this time that Rome allowed the Franks to settle across the Rhine as federates.</p>
<p>That meant that the Franks were free to live within the Roman territory, and they would</p>
<p>now serve in the Roman army and fight to defend Rome.</p>
<p>So the situation with the Visigoths was similar to that of the Franks.</p>
<p>The Romans could just bring in the Visigoths as federates.</p>
<p>In other words, let the Visigoths come in and fight for Rome.</p>
<p>And in fact, as far as the Roman army was concerned, the lines between the Romans and</p>
<p>the Germans was already becoming blurred.</p>
<p>The Franks were fighting in defense of the empire.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve noted before, the Romans were relying more and more on Germanic mercenaries</p>
<p>for troops.</p>
<p>And increasingly, these Germans were rising through the highest ranks of the Roman army,</p>
<p>and they were starting to hold many of the top military commands.</p>
<p>At least with respect to the military, the old distinction between Romans and Germans</p>
<p>had largely disappeared.</p>
<p>The Roman army wasn&rsquo;t really all that Roman anymore, and that meant that the Roman population</p>
<p>had become accustomed to relying on Germans for their defense.</p>
<p>So the Romans realized that a group like the Visigoths could be a potential asset to the</p>
<p>empire, especially at a time when they needed new soldiers.</p>
<p>And so the Romans agreed to let the Visigoths cross the Danube into Roman territory.</p>
<p>And they basically worked out the same arrangement that they had made with the Franks a few years</p>
<p>earlier.</p>
<p>The Visigoths were settled legally into Roman territory, and they agreed to become Roman</p>
<p>subjects, and all that that meant, including paying taxes and serving in the Roman army.</p>
<p>In exchange, the Romans agreed to provide the Goths with food and supplies, and eventually</p>
<p>new farmlands.</p>
<p>The only problem was that the Romans didn&rsquo;t keep their side of the bargain.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t prepared to accept 80,000 or more Goths into the empire.</p>
<p>All of this had happened very quickly, and Rome couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t provide adequate</p>
<p>food and shelter.</p>
<p>Within a few months, the Visigoths were beginning to starve, and the conditions started to become</p>
<p>unbearable.</p>
<p>They had avoided a quick destruction at the hands of the Huns, only to experience a slow</p>
<p>starvation at the hands of the Romans.</p>
<p>The Visigoths were eventually forced to sell themselves and their children into Roman slavery</p>
<p>for food.</p>
<p>The Romans even established a price for these sacrifices.</p>
<p>For each child offered to Rome as a slave, Rome would provide a dog in return, the dog</p>
<p>to be used for food.</p>
<p>The Visigoths finally reached a breaking point in the year 378, a couple of years after crossing</p>
<p>into Roman territory.</p>
<p>With nothing left to lose, the Visigoths rose in rebellion throughout the Balkans.</p>
<p>The Roman army, led by the Emperor Valens, engaged the Visigothic army at Adrianople</p>
<p>in modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>Now Valens underestimated the size of the Visigothic army.</p>
<p>He also underestimated a new technology which the Visigoths had picked up from the Huns,</p>
<p>the stirrup.</p>
<p>And the result was the complete annihilation of the Roman army by the Gothic cavalry.</p>
<p>Rough estimates suggest that about two-thirds of the Roman soldiers were killed in the battle,</p>
<p>including the Emperor Valens himself.</p>
<p>It was the worst defeat for the Roman army in 400 years.</p>
<p>And it was one of those landmark battles in world history as well, because it was the</p>
<p>first time that a foreign army was able to permanently occupy Roman territory.</p>
<p>Other Germanic tribes had invaded, but the Romans had always been able to eventually</p>
<p>turn them back.</p>
<p>But the Goths were here to stay.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the Romans by the Visigoths, a cycle ensued which was repeated over and</p>
<p>over again for the next thirty years.</p>
<p>The Goths and the Romans would fight for a while.</p>
<p>They would then agree to a treaty in which the Goths agreed to provide service and troops</p>
<p>to the Roman Empire in exchange for land and autonomy.</p>
<p>But the Romans would always fail to provide the agreed-upon land or resources or autonomy.</p>
<p>Or sometimes the Romans would just use the Gothic soldiers as disposable troops on the</p>
<p>front line to thereby preserve the Roman troops.</p>
<p>Over time, the Goths lost thousands of soldiers fighting Rome&rsquo;s wars.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Goths would reach a breaking point and rise in rebellion, and the cycle</p>
<p>would repeat itself.</p>
<p>This happened over and over again, until the Goths finally decided to head for Italy itself.</p>
<p>In the year 402, the Visigoths and the Romans fought each other in northern Italy.</p>
<p>The off-and-on battles extended into the following year when Rome finally began to withdraw troops</p>
<p>from the Rhine region and brought them home to protect Rome.</p>
<p>And that was really the beginning of the end for the Roman Empire in the West.</p>
<p>With the Rhine border left undefended, the Germanic tribes were basically free to cross</p>
<p>the Rhine directly into Roman Gaul.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>Without the Rhine border to hold them back, a collection of Germanic tribes began to storm</p>
<p>across the Rhine.</p>
<p>And this may ultimately be the most significant consequence of the Visigoth invasion of Italy.</p>
<p>The tribes which bolted across the Rhine into Gaul included West Germanic tribes like the</p>
<p>Suevis, it included East Germanic tribes like the Vandals, and it even included non-Germanic</p>
<p>tribes like the Alans who had been driven westward by the Huns.</p>
<p>These tribes invaded northern Gaul and plundered the region before turning southward and heading</p>
<p>towards southern Gaul.</p>
<p>I noted in the last episode that the Vandals traveled southward into modern-day Spain and</p>
<p>then crossed into northern Africa where they established their own kingdom there.</p>
<p>And while all of this was going on, another Germanic tribe called the Burgundians took</p>
<p>advantage of all these distractions and they too crossed the Rhine.</p>
<p>In time, they came to occupy a significant portion of eastern Gaul.</p>
<p>They eventually established their own Burgundian kingdom there, which later became the region</p>
<p>of Burgundy in France.</p>
<p>So that French Burgundy wine is actually named after a Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>The Roman army was simply unable to deal with all of these incursions, and revolts began</p>
<p>to break out within the Roman army itself.</p>
<p>Many Romans blamed the declining state of the empire on the invading Germans, and in</p>
<p>retaliation a large number of Germans were slaughtered in the border regions and within</p>
<p>Italy itself.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of this turn of events, many Germans and other non-Romans joined the Gothic</p>
<p>army for protection.</p>
<p>And by the year 408, the Gothic army was big enough and powerful enough that it began to</p>
<p>set its sights on the city of Rome itself.</p>
<p>Under the Gothic king Alaric, the Goths made camp outside of Rome, but the Romans paid</p>
<p>them off with gold and silver and the Goths withdrew.</p>
<p>But they were back again two years later, and this time they didn&rsquo;t withdraw.</p>
<p>They invaded and sacked Rome, which had been unconquered for 800 years.</p>
<p>You might remember the episode about the ancient Celts, and how the very early city of Rome</p>
<p>was sacked by Celtic-speaking tribes, and how that invasion forever changed the way</p>
<p>Romans viewed the people they considered to be barbarians in the north.</p>
<p>Well, for 800 years, the city of Rome had defended itself against those barbarians.</p>
<p>And in the process, Rome had emerged as one of the most powerful empires in the history</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>But now, in the year 410, all of that ended.</p>
<p>And it ended at the hands of the Visigoths.</p>
<p>The Visigoths assailed Rome and burned and plundered the city.</p>
<p>It was a devastating blow to the psyche of the Romans.</p>
<p>The Visigoths actually only stayed for three days, and they carried away as much wealth</p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>In that same year, 410, the Roman military leaders who were left in Britain requested</p>
<p>assistance to fend off invaders from northern Britain, groups like the Scots and the Picts</p>
<p>from the region of modern-day Scotland.</p>
<p>And Rome denied the request.</p>
<p>Britain was too far away, and there were too few troops to spare.</p>
<p>So 410 was an extremely important year in the crumbling of the empire.</p>
<p>It saw Rome sacked by the Goths, and it also saw Rome basically give up on Britain.</p>
<p>A few Roman troops were left behind in Britain, but they were only a token force, and there</p>
<p>was no way for them to fend off the invaders, which would soon be coming at them from all</p>
<p>directions.</p>
<p>After they sacked Rome, the Visigoths left and eventually migrated northward across the</p>
<p>Alps.</p>
<p>And then they moved westward into southwestern Gaul.</p>
<p>Remember that the Romans had abandoned the Rhine defenses by this point, so those Germanic</p>
<p>tribes that had poured across the Rhine a few years earlier, like the Vandals and the</p>
<p>Suevis and the Alans, well they had made it down into modern-day Spain.</p>
<p>The Romans actually enlisted the Visigoths to help them regain control of the Spanish</p>
<p>peninsula.</p>
<p>The Visigoths agreed and had some success against the various Germanic tribes in the</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>In the year 418, the Romans rewarded the Visigoths by giving them land in Aquitania in southern</p>
<p>Gaul, or southern France as we know it today.</p>
<p>Although Rome considered the Visigoths to be federates of the empire, living with Roman</p>
<p>permission on Roman soil, the Visigoths didn&rsquo;t view it that way at all.</p>
<p>They viewed the territory as a new independent Visigothic kingdom.</p>
<p>By the year 423, Roman control of western Europe had largely collapsed.</p>
<p>There were now three separate Germanic kingdoms in Gaul.</p>
<p>There was the new Visigothic kingdom in Aquitaine.</p>
<p>There was the Burgundian kingdom in southeastern Gaul.</p>
<p>And there was the Frankish kingdom in the northeast along the Rhine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down in modern-day Spain, there were two other Germanic kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Suavians in the northwest and the Alans had merged with the Vandals in the south.</p>
<p>Roman power was quickly collapsing and Germanic tribes were filling the void.</p>
<p>As Roman power collapsed, the Franks took advantage of the situation and they began</p>
<p>to expand southward from northern Gaul.</p>
<p>And as the Franks expanded southward, they began to push the Visigoths southward as well.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the Visigoths settled in northern Spain.</p>
<p>And that eventually forced the Vandals from southern Spain into North Africa as I mentioned</p>
<p>in the last episode.</p>
<p>So we can see how this type of chain reaction would occur.</p>
<p>When one tribe moved, it caused a domino effect and it ended up pushing many other tribes</p>
<p>out in front of it.</p>
<p>For the next three centuries, the Goths in Spain flourished under a succession of kings</p>
<p>in what would come to be known as the Visigothic kingdom.</p>
<p>The Visigothic kingdom expanded over time to include most of Spain as well as Aquitania</p>
<p>in southern Gaul.</p>
<p>But the expanding Franks eventually took Aquitaine back from the Goths.</p>
<p>But in Spain, the Goths continued to rule for a couple more centuries until the Muslim</p>
<p>Moors invaded from northern Africa.</p>
<p>At this point, we have to return to the Huns.</p>
<p>They had conquered the territory of the Goths in Eastern Europe a few decades earlier and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d set in motion a chain reaction of their own.</p>
<p>And they now had a new leader named Attila and they were beginning to look to the west.</p>
<p>The Eastern Roman Empire was still relatively strong, but the Western Empire was falling</p>
<p>apart.</p>
<p>So the west was the place to be if you were a Hun looking to expand into new territory.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 5th century, the Huns moved westward into Germania.</p>
<p>And by the year 451, they had actually crossed the Rhine and they were now in Roman territory</p>
<p>in Gaul.</p>
<p>By this point, the empire of the Huns almost equaled the Roman Empire in physical size.</p>
<p>And Attila&rsquo;s army included not only Huns, but many other Germanic allies, including</p>
<p>many Ostrogoths who were now forced to provide service to the Huns.</p>
<p>Attila laid waste to the northern region of Gaul.</p>
<p>And in response, the Romans enlisted the Visigoths and the Franks to form a unified</p>
<p>front in order to repel the Huns.</p>
<p>After all, the Huns were a threat to everybody in the region.</p>
<p>And together, the Romans, the Visigoths, and the Franks were able to force Attila to withdraw</p>
<p>from the region and return back across the Rhine.</p>
<p>In the following year, Attila set his sights on Italy.</p>
<p>He was headed straight for Rome when Leo, the Bishop of Rome, intervened.</p>
<p>The exact details are unknown, but Leo persuaded Attila to spare Rome and retreat.</p>
<p>Maybe Attila was too superstitious to attack the home of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Or maybe he was paid off, we may never know.</p>
<p>But we do know that Rome was spared from the Huns.</p>
<p>And we also know that Attila died the following year.</p>
<p>And in his absence and without his strong leadership, the Hunnic Empire quickly collapsed.</p>
<p>The empire was divided among Attila&rsquo;s brothers and son, and then the divided empire had to</p>
<p>deal with an uprising by Germanic peoples who saw an opportunity to overthrow the Huns</p>
<p>with the death of Attila.</p>
<p>Within a year after Attila&rsquo;s death, the Hunnic Empire was gone.</p>
<p>Though Rome was spared from attack by the Huns, it was of little consequence.</p>
<p>Because the Vandals arrived from Northern Africa just three years later.</p>
<p>And they remained for two weeks and basically stripped the city bare of everything movable</p>
<p>and valuable.</p>
<p>To deal with the Vandals, the Romans had to withdraw even more troops from Gaul.</p>
<p>And that allowed the Germans, especially the Franks, to expand even further throughout Gaul.</p>
<p>By this point, the Roman imperial government in the West was just a nominal government.</p>
<p>It no longer had any real power.</p>
<p>The real power in Western Europe lay with the Germanic kingdoms that had taken over.</p>
<p>The only vestige of Roman power in the West was within Italy itself.</p>
<p>And most of the remaining troops there were composed of Germanic mercenaries.</p>
<p>At some point around the year 476, these troops apparently decided, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Why are we fighting four of the Romans?</p>
<p>I mean, there wasn&rsquo;t really an empire left anymore.</p>
<p>All of the benefit of fighting four Rome was gone.</p>
<p>So in that year, 476, the Germanic soldier Odoacer overthrew the completely powerless</p>
<p>teenage Roman emperor.</p>
<p>Technically, Odoacer became the last Roman emperor of the West.</p>
<p>But he had no use for the title.</p>
<p>It was really just a hollow title at that point.</p>
<p>He recognized the Eastern Roman emperor in Constantinople as the true successor to the</p>
<p>original Roman Empire.</p>
<p>He sent the imperial cloak and crown to Constantinople.</p>
<p>And that was it, the official end of the Roman Empire in the West.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a little more history beyond this date of 476, which is often cited as</p>
<p>the official end of the empire.</p>
<p>The Eastern Empire wasn&rsquo;t exactly happy that the Western Roman emperor had been overthrown</p>
<p>by Odoacer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after the collapse of the Huns, the Ostrogoths had once again emerged as an</p>
<p>independent tribe.</p>
<p>And over time, they followed basically the same path that their cousins, the Visigoths,</p>
<p>had followed a few decades earlier.</p>
<p>They traveled throughout southeastern Europe, and they found themselves on the border of</p>
<p>the Eastern Roman Empire.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the Eastern Empire offered the Ostrogoths a deal.</p>
<p>If they went to Italy and removed Odoacer from power, then they could rule Italy in</p>
<p>his absence.</p>
<p>This allowed the Eastern Empire to basically kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>They could get rid of Odoacer in Italy, and they could get rid of the Ostrogothic threat</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>The Ostrogoths accepted the offer, and they invaded northern Italy in the year 488, about</p>
<p>12 years after Odoacer had taken over there.</p>
<p>The Ostrogoths eventually emerged victorious, and they established a kingdom in northern</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>But in the end, the kingdom was short-lived.</p>
<p>It only lasted about 50 years.</p>
<p>The Eastern Roman Empire, under the Emperor Justinian, eventually swept in and took the</p>
<p>region back from the Goths around the middle of the 6th century.</p>
<p>Now an official in Justinian&rsquo;s court, named Procopius, wrote three histories during his</p>
<p>lifetime.</p>
<p>All of them were written in Greek, which was the language of the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p>One dealt specifically with the Eastern Empire&rsquo;s wars against the Ostrogoths in Italy, as well</p>
<p>as the Vandals in North Africa.</p>
<p>Another one dealt with the buildings built during Justinian&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>But the third one was titled Anecdota, which literally meant unpublished things in Greek.</p>
<p>This collection wasn&rsquo;t published during the lifetime of Procopius because it contained</p>
<p>attacks on the Emperor Justinian, the Emperor&rsquo;s wife, and other officials.</p>
<p>It also contained a lot of scandalous stories and allegations.</p>
<p>But this third book was published after Procopius died, and its title, Anecdota, came to the</p>
<p>mean a short story about someone or something, usually an amusing story.</p>
<p>And of course, we know it as anecdote today in modern English.</p>
<p>So all of this history basically takes us to the end of the 5th century, around the</p>
<p>year 500, and we can finally stop and catch our breath.</p>
<p>Over the preceding century, we&rsquo;ve seen the fall of Western Rome, we&rsquo;ve seen the rise</p>
<p>of the Gothic and other Germanic kingdoms, and we&rsquo;ve seen the rise and fall of the Huns.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the political and military changes during this period were enormous.</p>
<p>And there were linguistic changes as well, but compared to the political changes, the</p>
<p>linguistic changes were not as great as you might expect.</p>
<p>With Germanic kingdoms now in control of much of the Latin-speaking territory in Western</p>
<p>Europe, we might expect Germanic languages to gradually replace Latin there.</p>
<p>But with one notable exception, that&rsquo;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Of course, that one exception is notable because it&rsquo;s English.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at why the Anglo-Saxon dialects took root in Britain in the next few episodes.</p>
<p>But in continental Europe, the Germanic languages didn&rsquo;t replace Latin.</p>
<p>The new Germanic kingdoms like the Visigoths in Spain, and the Franks in Gaul, and the</p>
<p>Ostrogoths in Italy, they were all ruled by an elite Germanic-speaking ruling class.</p>
<p>But they ruled over a native population that spoke Latin.</p>
<p>Latin was too ingrained by this point, but there was more to it than that.</p>
<p>Though the Roman Empire had collapsed, Latin was still held in very high regard.</p>
<p>It was still associated with the glory days of Rome.</p>
<p>It was the language of Roman culture and Roman scholarship.</p>
<p>In most of these cases, the new Germanic rulers saw themselves as extensions of the earlier</p>
<p>Roman rulers.</p>
<p>And the evidence suggests that rulers like the Visigoths actually sought to learn Latin</p>
<p>since it held such a high status and was associated with Roman culture and power.</p>
<p>Of course, there were other factors at work as well.</p>
<p>The rapidly expanding Catholic Church was centered in Rome.</p>
<p>Early on, most Christian texts had been written in Greek.</p>
<p>But since the Catholic Church was headquartered in Rome, the Roman Church chose to translate</p>
<p>the Greek text into Latin.</p>
<p>By the end of the 4th century, Latin was the official language of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>And that meant that all church business was going to be conducted in Latin.</p>
<p>And this gave Latin an additional prestige above regional Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But there was also another factor at work.</p>
<p>With so much turmoil in Europe, and with so many people on the move, it became important</p>
<p>for people in different regions to find a common language for communication.</p>
<p>And for all the reasons which I just mentioned, Latin was the obvious choice as a lingua franca.</p>
<p>In fact, it was already a lingua franca due to the power and prestige of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>So it was natural for people to gravitate to Latin as a common international language.</p>
<p>The need for a common language was further heightened by the fact that both Latin and</p>
<p>the Germanic languages were beginning to fracture into distinct regional dialects and languages.</p>
<p>And we know by now, languages are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>And as people become isolated from each other, the natural process of language change means</p>
<p>that regional variations start to emerge.</p>
<p>And over time, these differences will continue to evolve until the dialects can&rsquo;t be mutually</p>
<p>understood anymore, and we can then call them distinct languages.</p>
<p>Well, that process can be slowed if there&rsquo;s an educational system that imposes a standard</p>
<p>version of the language on everyone, or almost everyone.</p>
<p>So if everyone is required to study a common standardized form of English in school, that</p>
<p>tends to keep us all on the same page, speaking the same language.</p>
<p>Regional variations will still occur and develop over time, but we all have a common anchor</p>
<p>which slows that process down a bit.</p>
<p>And that was what had helped to preserve a standardized form of Latin throughout the</p>
<p>Roman Empire.</p>
<p>As long as the Roman educational system was in place, a standardized form of Latin was</p>
<p>taught and regional variations were minimized.</p>
<p>But when the Roman Empire collapsed in the West, the Roman educational system also collapsed.</p>
<p>And when that went away, the anchor that was holding a common form of Latin in place also</p>
<p>gave way.</p>
<p>And as we might expect, with the fall of Rome, those regional, vulgar Latin dialects quickly</p>
<p>evolved into separate and distinct languages.</p>
<p>Within three or four centuries, we&rsquo;ll start to refer to these regional dialects by new</p>
<p>names – French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, the Germanic regions never had a standardized education system akin to the</p>
<p>Roman system, so there was never anything in place to keep the Germanic dialects from</p>
<p>rapidly evolving into new languages.</p>
<p>So that process was well underway within the Germanic regions as well.</p>
<p>So linguistic diversity was increasingly common throughout Western Europe.</p>
<p>And as each region began to evolve its own dialect and its own language, it became even</p>
<p>more important for these people to find ways to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>And that brings us back to Latin.</p>
<p>The standardized form of Latin remained a useful lingua franca even as the language</p>
<p>itself was in the process of fracturing and evolving out of existence.</p>
<p>The early French speakers could still communicate with the early Spanish speakers and the early</p>
<p>Italian speakers as long as they all reverted back to the original Latin.</p>
<p>So we can see how Latin maintained its footing in Western Europe, and we can see why the</p>
<p>new Germanic rulers in this region ultimately learned to speak Latin, rather than trying</p>
<p>to force the natives to learn a foreign Germanic language.</p>
<p>But if we look close enough, we can see that some of the words from those Germanic languages</p>
<p>did filter down into the various Romance languages.</p>
<p>And the number of Germanic words which survived in the respective Romance languages is directly</p>
<p>related to the amount of time in which the Germanic kingdoms were in place in those regions.</p>
<p>For example, the Franks established the modern nation of France, so their influence on early</p>
<p>French was substantial.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look a little more closely at the Franks in the next episode.</p>
<p>With respect to the Goths, the Ostrogoths were only in charge of Italy for a few decades,</p>
<p>so the influence of the Gothic language in Italy is very limited.</p>
<p>Perhaps only a handful of Gothic words survive into modern Italian.</p>
<p>And even then, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine if the Germanic words which passed into early</p>
<p>Italian came from the Goths or from another Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see next time, the Gothic kingdom in Italy was later succeeded by another Germanic</p>
<p>kingdom, the Lombards.</p>
<p>And Germanic tribes were a regular presence in and around Italy during this period, so</p>
<p>the etymology of those Italian words is tricky.</p>
<p>But in Spain, the Visigothic kingdom was in place for over two centuries.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little easier to identify Gothic words in modern Spanish.</p>
<p>In earlier episodes, I discussed the fact that the Goths had a word, rix, which meant</p>
<p>powerful, ruler, or kingdom.</p>
<p>The Old English version of that word was rica, and it eventually evolved into the word richa,</p>
<p>and it later evolved into the word rich in modern English.</p>
<p>Well, the Gothic version of that word, rix, passed into the Latin spoken in Spain during</p>
<p>the time of the Visigoths, and from there, it passed into later Spanish.</p>
<p>We see it in the word rico, which means rich in Spanish.</p>
<p>For example, Puerto Rico means rich port.</p>
<p>Well, Spanish rico sounds similar to English rich because they have a common Germanic origin,</p>
<p>not a common Latin origin.</p>
<p>That word was also part of the name of the last Visigothic ruler of Spain.</p>
<p>His name was Roderick.</p>
<p>It was a combination of the Gothic word rad, meaning renowned, and rix, meaning powerful</p>
<p>or ruler.</p>
<p>Well, the name Roderick passed into Spanish, and we see it in modern Spanish names like</p>
<p>Rodrigo, and very common surnames like Rodriguez and Ruiz.</p>
<p>Again, those names have Gothic origins.</p>
<p>There was another Gothic name that used this suffix rick or rick.</p>
<p>It was Almaric, and that name passed into both Italian and Spanish.</p>
<p>The Spanish name was Amerigo, and the Italian version of the name was Amerigo.</p>
<p>And you might know that an Italian explorer with the name Amerigo Vespucci concluded shortly</p>
<p>after Columbus&rsquo; voyage across the Atlantic that Columbus didn&rsquo;t actually reach Eastern</p>
<p>Asia as originally thought.</p>
<p>Vespucci realized that Columbus had actually discovered a new continent.</p>
<p>What ended up being two continents.</p>
<p>And both of those continents were named after him, North and South America.</p>
<p>So America is a word derived from an Italian name which ultimately came from a Gothic name.</p>
<p>So if the Ostrogoths hadn&rsquo;t established a kingdom in Italy in the 5th century, we probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have the name America today.</p>
<p>By the way, the Spanish words guardia, meaning guard, ganso, meaning goose, banda, meaning</p>
<p>band or group, and atacar, meaning attack, all came from Gothic words.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why all of those words resemble the modern English versions of those words.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Gothic language disappeared after the collapse of the Ostrogoth and Visigoth</p>
<p>kingdoms.</p>
<p>In fact, it may have disappeared before then because, as we&rsquo;ve seen, Latin remained the</p>
<p>dominant language within those kingdoms.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one little footnote to this story.</p>
<p>In the 1500s, a Flemish ambassador in the Crimean region in the northern part of the</p>
<p>Black Sea claimed to have discovered people speaking Gothic.</p>
<p>He believed it to be a vestige of the original Ostrogothic language from the time when the</p>
<p>Ostrogoths had lived there over a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>He recorded about a hundred words from the language in a letter, which was published</p>
<p>a few years later.</p>
<p>The words are actually very similar to the words used by Wilphelus in the Gothic translation</p>
<p>of the Bible.</p>
<p>Linguists later traveled to the region to investigate the purported language, but none</p>
<p>of them were able to confirm that it actually existed.</p>
<p>So this still remains a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly possible that the Gothic language survived in some form in the northern</p>
<p>Black Sea region as recently as five centuries ago.</p>
<p>So that concludes our look at Gothic and the end of the Roman Empire in the West.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;re going to begin the transition to Old English.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to turn our attention northward to the coastal regions around northern Germany</p>
<p>and Denmark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s here that a handful of Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians</p>
<p>sought to take advantage of the Roman collapse in the West.</p>
<p>And one of their targets was the formerly Roman territory of southern Britain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll look at who these tribes were, and how their continental languages became</p>
<p>the language we know as Old English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
