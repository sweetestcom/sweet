    <p>The following is a conversation with Rick Doblin,</p>
<p>founder and executive director</p>
<p>of the Multidisciplinary Association</p>
<p>for Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.</p>
<p>He is one of the seminal figures</p>
<p>in both the cultural history</p>
<p>and the cutting edge science of psychedelics.</p>
<p>He was there along with the biggest characters</p>
<p>throughout this fascinating history of psychedelics,</p>
<p>and he is here to tell the story.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Theragun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Asleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say</p>
<p>that exploring the places the human mind can go</p>
<p>can help us understand where it comes from,</p>
<p>how it works, and how to engineer mental journeys,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s through life experiences,</p>
<p>chemical substances, brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>or interactions with artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I think the dissolution of the ego</p>
<p>for stretches of time is a powerful tool</p>
<p>for understanding yourself.</p>
<p>A lot of things can do this,</p>
<p>including jiu jitsu, literature, meditation,</p>
<p>but psychedelics is definitely, or at least arguably,</p>
<p>one of the most powerful, from psilocybin to DMT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited that people like Rick</p>
<p>are leading the scientific research</p>
<p>that reveals the efficacy and the safety of these substances</p>
<p>so that their proper dosage and usage protocols</p>
<p>can be understood and people like me</p>
<p>can safely and effectively use them,</p>
<p>not just for recreation,</p>
<p>but for rigorous exploration of my own mind.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Rick Doblin.</p>
<p>Could you give an introduction to psychedelics,</p>
<p>like a big, bold, whirlwind overview?</p>
<p>What are psychedelics?</p>
<p>What are the kinds of psychedelics out there?</p>
<p>In whatever way you think is meaningful.</p>
<p>All right, well, when I started MAPS,</p>
<p>the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies,</p>
<p>it was very important for me that psychedelic be in the name.</p>
<p>And the way in which the original meaning of psychedelic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind manifesting.</p>
<p>It was created by Humphrey Osmond</p>
<p>in a dialogue with Aldous Huxley.</p>
<p>And so psychedelic means mind manifesting.</p>
<p>And so we interpret that very broadly</p>
<p>to mean dreams are psychedelic.</p>
<p>Anything that kind of brings things to the surface,</p>
<p>holotropic breath work, hyperventilation is psychedelic.</p>
<p>So most people think psychedelic</p>
<p>is only about certain kind of chemical substances,</p>
<p>either natural or synthetic,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve got a much broader view of that.</p>
<p>Meditation can be psychedelic in some ways,</p>
<p>but our primary focus is on the drugs,</p>
<p>is on the medicines or the, you might call them,</p>
<p>some people might call them spiritual tools or sacraments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of two general categories of those.</p>
<p>One are what are called the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>and those are the ego dissolving,</p>
<p>sort of merged into unitive states.</p>
<p>Those are like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca,</p>
<p>ibogaine, DMT, things like that.</p>
<p>And then there is MDMA, which some people even argue</p>
<p>is not a psychedelic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s an empathogen or an intactogen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about touching within or empathy.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do the same kind of ego dissolution</p>
<p>that the classic psychedelics do,</p>
<p>but it brings material to the surface</p>
<p>and it changes the way we process information.</p>
<p>And so I think you can quibble about whether it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly not a classic psychedelic,</p>
<p>but I think MDMA is also a psychedelic.</p>
<p>Marijuana, I would say, is a psychedelic.</p>
<p>Marijuana is closer to the classic psychedelics</p>
<p>than it is to MDMA.</p>
<p>One point I like to make is dreams,</p>
<p>because then everybody can relate to that.</p>
<p>Dreams are psychedelic.</p>
<p>Dreams bring emotions, feelings, ideas, concepts,</p>
<p>in symbolic form a lot of times,</p>
<p>or just in raw emotions to the surface.</p>
<p>So when people hear the word psychedelic,</p>
<p>often they are frightened by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about loss of control.</p>
<p>And it is, to an extent, loss of conscious control,</p>
<p>particularly with the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>And we know with dreams</p>
<p>that we can have frightening dreams, nightmares,</p>
<p>but I think that anchoring the concept of psychedelic</p>
<p>in dreams is really helpful for people to know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of a natural state</p>
<p>and that there are other ways that you can catalyze it</p>
<p>than by going to sleep,</p>
<p>and that for thousands of years,</p>
<p>substances have been used in that way.</p>
<p>So you mentioned this idea of bringing something</p>
<p>to the surface, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>So can you maybe elaborate the surface</p>
<p>and what is there in the depths of things</p>
<p>and how does ego dissolution fits into that?</p>
<p>Well, Aldous Huxley talked about the brain</p>
<p>as a reducing valve,</p>
<p>that we have an enormous amount of information.</p>
<p>So right now there&rsquo;s an air conditioning sound</p>
<p>in the background,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not crucial to what you and I are doing,</p>
<p>talking to each other, so we kind of tune that out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of sights and sounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s incoming information</p>
<p>in all the different sense modalities,</p>
<p>and we have to figure out what&rsquo;s important to us.</p>
<p>And so the mind, in a way, focuses a lot on</p>
<p>what are our core needs?</p>
<p>And we filter all the incoming information</p>
<p>that we get towards focusing on what our core needs,</p>
<p>and we can even get to Abraham Maslow</p>
<p>and the hierarchy of needs about survival needs,</p>
<p>belonging needs, esteem needs, go on.</p>
<p>So I think what I mean by bringing things to the surface</p>
<p>is that we tend to not focus on a lot of things</p>
<p>that are coming, but we also push away</p>
<p>things that are difficult emotionally,</p>
<p>difficult cognitively.</p>
<p>We all know that we&rsquo;re on this very short trajectory</p>
<p>from birth to death,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not constantly thinking about dying,</p>
<p>although that can actually be helpful</p>
<p>to focus us on what&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Traumas are often suppressed.</p>
<p>Conflicts, we see in America and around the world</p>
<p>a kind of rise of irrationality</p>
<p>where people push away their logic</p>
<p>in order for their emotional tribal needs to be met.</p>
<p>A lot of people are suffering from early childhood traumas</p>
<p>of a different kinds or abandonment issues</p>
<p>or anything.</p>
<p>So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive</p>
<p>and what we need for work and esteem.</p>
<p>And so psychedelics, by dissolving this ego control</p>
<p>or by with MDMA kind of strengthening our sense of self</p>
<p>and our sense of self acceptance,</p>
<p>we can bring in other information</p>
<p>that have previously been too complicated or too painful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of psychedelics</p>
<p>as conjuring up something new.</p>
<p>It is more revealing something that is already there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very crucial thing.</p>
<p>So yes, Sasha Shulgin who sort of the godfather of MDMA,</p>
<p>he sort of rediscovered it</p>
<p>and brought it back into use.</p>
<p>He talked about his first experience was with mescaline.</p>
<p>His first psychedelic experience was with mescaline</p>
<p>and he had a tremendous experience.</p>
<p>But what he said about it was he was having</p>
<p>a human experience that the mescaline was helping him access</p>
<p>rather than that he was having a mescaline experience.</p>
<p>So that it&rsquo;s not like you pop a pill</p>
<p>and you always have the same kind of experience</p>
<p>as everybody else.</p>
<p>The experience is not contained in the pill.</p>
<p>The pill opens you up</p>
<p>and you have an experience of yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes these are experiences</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never consciously had.</p>
<p>But we can say right now that we know</p>
<p>that our body below the level of our conscious awareness</p>
<p>has all these self healing mechanisms.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t modulate them</p>
<p>to a large extent by conscious control.</p>
<p>I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind body</p>
<p>and we learn about the placebo effect,</p>
<p>how what we think is the case.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s experiences</p>
<p>that are below our level of conscious awareness,</p>
<p>particularly once we&rsquo;re adults</p>
<p>that are more of these unit of mystical experiences,</p>
<p>sense of connection.</p>
<p>I think kids are like this a lot.</p>
<p>We kind of come from the void, you could say,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re born and you have</p>
<p>a different way of processing information.</p>
<p>One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine,</p>
<p>which is been approved as ketamine for depression,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s used for anesthesia.</p>
<p>And roughly one 10th the anesthetic dose</p>
<p>is a psychedelic dose.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s used in anesthesia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called the emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>So this is, you get enough ketamine for,</p>
<p>you can be operated on, you&rsquo;re not in pain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really there, your ego&rsquo;s knocked out,</p>
<p>but you can still breathe.</p>
<p>But as the operations get over</p>
<p>and then people metabolize the ketamine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a process that they call the emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like as you&rsquo;re emerging from this tranquilized state,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you pass through the psychedelic phase.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t prepare people for that.</p>
<p>And what we see is that a lot of adults</p>
<p>have difficult times with that,</p>
<p>but children don&rsquo;t seem to have those problems.</p>
<p>Children are a little bit more already in this kind of state.</p>
<p>And so ketamine is used quite frequently</p>
<p>in children now for anesthesia.</p>
<p>So all of that is to say to your question</p>
<p>that I think the psychedelics</p>
<p>reveal things that are within us.</p>
<p>Some things that are how we process information</p>
<p>back when we were children.</p>
<p>Other things that we&rsquo;ve never thought of before</p>
<p>that are sort of baked into our consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one drug, 5MeO DMT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this toxin from a Sonoran toad</p>
<p>that many people consider it to be the most powerful</p>
<p>of all the psychedelics.</p>
<p>And it kind of knocks the ego structures completely out of it</p>
<p>and we experience something different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I think that&rsquo;s always within us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at a deeper layer.</p>
<p>So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions</p>
<p>and then we experience things in a different way.</p>
<p>So my sense is that these are human experiences</p>
<p>that the psychedelics bring us to.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really profound.</p>
<p>And DMT is a really interesting example.</p>
<p>So Terence McKenna has talked about these machine elves.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this, I think from the people I&rsquo;ve heard speak</p>
<p>about the experience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense that you are traveling elsewhere</p>
<p>to meet entities, whether they&rsquo;re elves or not.</p>
<p>So in your sense, you&rsquo;re not traveling elsewhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just revealing something that&rsquo;s within</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s a particular mechanism</p>
<p>of revealing what&rsquo;s already within.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I knew Terence.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time talking with Terence</p>
<p>and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that he was saying.</p>
<p>He was a tremendous entertainer and I think he did a lot</p>
<p>of really good things and focused us</p>
<p>on the power of psychedelics.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;ve never seen these quote machine elves.</p>
<p>I think culture is more determinative</p>
<p>of what people experience under psychedelics,</p>
<p>your preconceptions, than we give it credit for.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a lot of priming that you could say</p>
<p>that people receive by stories from their culture.</p>
<p>With ayahuasca, it&rsquo;s about jaguars and Amazonian animals.</p>
<p>And so I think these machine elves are this construct</p>
<p>of Terence that other people do see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some people that are very interested</p>
<p>in doing a study and that they&rsquo;re well funded</p>
<p>and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion</p>
<p>of DMT for them specifically to see,</p>
<p>do they contact machine elves or aliens</p>
<p>and what kind of information do they bring back</p>
<p>from these other selves, other places or other entities?</p>
<p>One question is, who are we?</p>
<p>Are we connected to everything in the universe?</p>
<p>We certainly know in many cases,</p>
<p>you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t interpret experiences that we have</p>
<p>of some entity that&rsquo;s somehow or other</p>
<p>deep in our consciousness that&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of who we are.</p>
<p>So I tend to interpret it in that way.</p>
<p>The question is, how big are we?</p>
<p>And how many ideas are within us</p>
<p>that can be revealed by changing the perspective?</p>
<p>You mentioned physics.</p>
<p>What physicists, especially mathematical physicists</p>
<p>or mathematicians do is they reveal truths</p>
<p>by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem</p>
<p>that reveals the simplicity of how it actually works</p>
<p>in totally new ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Einstein did.</p>
<p>Like every progress in physics</p>
<p>and certainly every progress in mathematics</p>
<p>requires you to take a different perspective.</p>
<p>And then perhaps that&rsquo;s exactly what psychedelics are doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re contacting aliens that are elsewhere.</p>
<p>It may be revealing the connection between us</p>
<p>and other living life forms,</p>
<p>or actually it might be revealing</p>
<p>a totally new perspective on what life is</p>
<p>or what consciousness is and giving us a glimpse at that</p>
<p>even though our cognitive capabilities are limited</p>
<p>to fully grasp and understand it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just giving us an inkling of that somehow.</p>
<p>And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous</p>
<p>not from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>in the sense that we don&rsquo;t have a good physics of life</p>
<p>or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness,</p>
<p>but getting a glimpse of that</p>
<p>is giving us a little bit of maybe an intuition</p>
<p>of which way to head to build such a physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s this other concept</p>
<p>I guess I would like to talk about briefly,</p>
<p>this Jungian collective unconscious,</p>
<p>this idea that somehow or other everything</p>
<p>that has ever happened is still accessible,</p>
<p>maybe not with as much data</p>
<p>or as much resolution,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s wave resonances.</p>
<p>So that I do believe that we can have experiences</p>
<p>as part of this human collective unconscious</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not from our own life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that we can, it&rsquo;s like the holographic realities</p>
<p>and that there is a way to gather information</p>
<p>that can be accurate about other times and places</p>
<p>through depth investigations of our own consciousness.</p>
<p>But I think what I tend to believe</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s emotional resonances</p>
<p>between where we&rsquo;re at now in this life</p>
<p>and other kind of experiences</p>
<p>that people have had before.</p>
<p>And we always hear about everybody</p>
<p>who talks about past lives,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always kings and queens.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s again,</p>
<p>you filter things what you want to be true.</p>
<p>But I do think that there is a way to access information</p>
<p>beyond what we&rsquo;ve taken in in our own temporal existence</p>
<p>through our own five senses.</p>
<p>In some ways, I really find that compelling,</p>
<p>the notion that that information is already there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re simply just moving the attention of your mind</p>
<p>to different parts of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we have that with the radio.</p>
<p>I mean, you got a frequency, you turn all this information,</p>
<p>you could actually say right now in the space between us,</p>
<p>we have the whole world&rsquo;s knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t see it. We just have to tune in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are the interesting differences,</p>
<p>would you say, between the various psychedelics</p>
<p>that you mentioned, ayahuasca, DMT, acid, LSD,</p>
<p>marijuana, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, MDMA?</p>
<p>You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about scientifically some of the different</p>
<p>studies that have been conducted on each,</p>
<p>but sort of at the high level.</p>
<p>What are some interesting differences?</p>
<p>Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of</p>
<p>that I think is completely misplaced</p>
<p>is some are from nature, some are from the lab.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of like romantic thought</p>
<p>that if it&rsquo;s from nature, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s from the lab, it&rsquo;s somehow tainted by humanity.</p>
<p>And therefore, some people are like</p>
<p>all for plant psychedelics.</p>
<p>We see the policy changes that have been happening</p>
<p>in a couple of cities, Cambridge, Somerville,</p>
<p>not far from where we&rsquo;re at now,</p>
<p>where they decriminalize plant medicines.</p>
<p>So they call it decriminalizing nature.</p>
<p>So I think that there is,</p>
<p>from my perspective,</p>
<p>certain things from nature are poison,</p>
<p>certain things from the lab are spiritual,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t show up in nature, like LSD.</p>
<p>Now there is something, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide.</p>
<p>There is lysergic acid amide, LSA,</p>
<p>which comes from morning glory seeds.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very similar.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into that distinction</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some fundamental preference.</p>
<p>One of the things that Terence McKenna,</p>
<p>since we talked about him,</p>
<p>he talked about how if it&rsquo;s from nature, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, we should be suspect.</p>
<p>Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences.</p>
<p>But actually Terence, in 1984,</p>
<p>we were at Esalen with a bunch of other people.</p>
<p>This was before the crackdown on MDMA.</p>
<p>And this was some of the underground therapists</p>
<p>and the above ground researchers</p>
<p>who were trying to talk about how to protect MDMA</p>
<p>from this eventual crackdown.</p>
<p>And Terence was like, forget about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the lab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>We have thousands of years of history,</p>
<p>all these other things.</p>
<p>And what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I was like, Terence, you&rsquo;re so unscientific.</p>
<p>Another way to say it is, and I just said,</p>
<p>we need a study of the safety of MDMA.</p>
<p>And so then Dick Price, who started Esalen,</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ll put a thousand, Dick Price, he put a thousand.</p>
<p>So Terence was actually the catalyst</p>
<p>for the first study with MDMA.</p>
<p>Just because he was so frustrating</p>
<p>about how plants are okay.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s from the lab, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one distinction.</p>
<p>The other distinction is that he was a scientist.</p>
<p>The other distinction is this sense of classic psychedelics</p>
<p>versus things like MDMA.</p>
<p>So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?</p>
<p>And you could say, to what extent do they cause visions?</p>
<p>The 5HT2A serotonin receptor subtype,</p>
<p>which is responsible for a lot of that</p>
<p>where these drugs are activating.</p>
<p>Now, mescaline of all the psychedelics,</p>
<p>chemically, it&rsquo;s the most similar to MDMA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phenethylamine, which is MDMA.</p>
<p>So in the 50s, there was the, 53, I think it was,</p>
<p>the Army Chemical Warfare Service</p>
<p>wanted to look at drugs for interrogations,</p>
<p>mind control, nonlethal incapacitants.</p>
<p>They did a study in eight substances.</p>
<p>These were now toxicity studies in animals.</p>
<p>And on the one side was methamphetamine,</p>
<p>and the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in the middle,</p>
<p>chemically.</p>
<p>So mescaline of these psychedelics</p>
<p>tends to have the warmth that MDMA has.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the main active ingredient in peyote.</p>
<p>It is very psychedelic, very visual.</p>
<p>Another distinction with these different drugs</p>
<p>is how long they last.</p>
<p>And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration.</p>
<p>So for example, if you smoke DMT,</p>
<p>it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>within seconds, you&rsquo;re off in another world.</p>
<p>Similarly, 5MeO DMT, very rapid.</p>
<p>When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s mixed with another substance</p>
<p>that makes it so that it&rsquo;s orally active,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a couple hours.</p>
<p>So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes.</p>
<p>Psilocybin is more like five or six hours,</p>
<p>or four to six hours.</p>
<p>MDMA is similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one reason why in our research,</p>
<p>we give an initial dose of MDMA,</p>
<p>and then two hours later,</p>
<p>we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau,</p>
<p>because we want it to last longer</p>
<p>for people to be in this therapeutic state.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another distinction is how long these drugs last.</p>
<p>Another distinction is which of them</p>
<p>come from a religious context,</p>
<p>have a religion built around them.</p>
<p>We have this sense that some people are saying</p>
<p>that 5MeO DMT and the Sonoran Toad,</p>
<p>that they have this long history of indigenous use,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all modern,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made up, and it&rsquo;s kind of a new approach.</p>
<p>However, there was thousands of years of use</p>
<p>of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts.</p>
<p>From 1600 BC to 396 AD,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s longest mystery ceremonies,</p>
<p>the Eleusinian Mysteries,</p>
<p>sort of the heart of Greek culture,</p>
<p>the heart of Western culture,</p>
<p>that was a psychedelic potion called Kikion</p>
<p>that seems like it&rsquo;s very much like an LSD like substance.</p>
<p>Aragat on grain and LSD comes from Aragat.</p>
<p>So I think that there are a lot of ways</p>
<p>to look at these different substances.</p>
<p>Another distinction is which one of them</p>
<p>are being researched right now in scientific context</p>
<p>and which are not.</p>
<p>And because of the rise of all these for profit companies</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s looking for what they can patent,</p>
<p>what they can claim, the land grab,</p>
<p>more and more there are companies</p>
<p>looking at every different kind of psychedelics.</p>
<p>The ones that are most important</p>
<p>that are not being researched, Mescaline,</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s a company to do Mescaline,</p>
<p>the Jernico Lab, Ibogaine,</p>
<p>which is crucial for opiate addiction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new company, a branch of this company,</p>
<p>Atai, that&rsquo;s gonna be looking at Ibogaine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say the rise of the for profit companies</p>
<p>is making it so that there&rsquo;s just gonna be</p>
<p>an enormous amount of investigations</p>
<p>into all these different psychedelics.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re gonna see is the development</p>
<p>of new psychedelics that we don&rsquo;t know anything about</p>
<p>that have not existed yet</p>
<p>because a lot of these for profit companies</p>
<p>are gonna wanna invent and patent</p>
<p>and have composition of matter patents on new molecules.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot of that happening too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of doors you&rsquo;ve opened</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna walk through all of them,</p>
<p>including the research and so on,</p>
<p>but on this one little tangent</p>
<p>of the future of psychedelics,</p>
<p>so engineering new psychedelics,</p>
<p>can you comment on maybe the chemistry</p>
<p>and the biology of how psychedelics work</p>
<p>and where is the space of possible engineering</p>
<p>of psychedelics and what kind of things</p>
<p>might they unlock in terms of the possible places</p>
<p>our mind would be able to go</p>
<p>and the effects of that of improving health,</p>
<p>but maybe at the basic level of chemistry</p>
<p>and the space of what could be engineered?</p>
<p>Well, you reminded me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to exactly what you said,</p>
<p>but you reminded me of a talk I heard</p>
<p>by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died.</p>
<p>And what he talked about is how technology</p>
<p>was making things ever smaller,</p>
<p>that we are able to pack more and more information</p>
<p>into smaller and smaller spaces</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re developing technologies</p>
<p>of communications with people,</p>
<p>we now know the internet and things like that.</p>
<p>But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution</p>
<p>of this sort of research would move</p>
<p>from this miniaturization to telepathy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that was like a shocking thing</p>
<p>for somebody like scientific like that to say that.</p>
<p>So will we unlock those parts</p>
<p>where I talked about the collective unconscious?</p>
<p>Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>There was Stan Groff,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s leading LSD researcher</p>
<p>and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida.</p>
<p>They were talking about stories that they had heard</p>
<p>about MDMA that people take</p>
<p>and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT.</p>
<p>And so you get this ego dissolution,</p>
<p>but underneath it, you have this sense of ego,</p>
<p>sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance,</p>
<p>kind of grounds it.</p>
<p>So Stan was like, that&rsquo;s the future of psychiatry,</p>
<p>that you can watch without the terror</p>
<p>of the ego dissolution,</p>
<p>the sense that you&rsquo;re losing your mind</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going crazy or you&rsquo;re dying,</p>
<p>or that you have this grounded sense of safety</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re dissolving your normal sense</p>
<p>of how you see things.</p>
<p>And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way</p>
<p>that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person,</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of this manual potion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s through experiment.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know about fine tuning things</p>
<p>to the person in the sense that</p>
<p>we believe there&rsquo;s this inner healer,</p>
<p>this kind of inner healing intelligence.</p>
<p>We talked about it, the body repairs itself.</p>
<p>So I think we more need to create safety for people</p>
<p>and then what emerges will be customized</p>
<p>to what they need to be looking at</p>
<p>from this inner healing intelligence.</p>
<p>At the same time, we will move to,</p>
<p>we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology</p>
<p>where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors</p>
<p>and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents</p>
<p>and you do like personalized chemotherapy.</p>
<p>I think we will have more like</p>
<p>personalized psychedelic therapy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be more like a sequence of different drugs</p>
<p>that people go through over an extended period of time</p>
<p>and then you kind of customize what&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>and sometimes you&rsquo;ll combine different drugs together</p>
<p>like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA</p>
<p>or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations</p>
<p>or psilocybin MDMA combinations.</p>
<p>Chemistry is not my strength.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more into clinical applications and policy,</p>
<p>but I can say that from what I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from reading from others and research done by others</p>
<p>that different psychedelics have an impact</p>
<p>on different neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>different other parts of energies in the brain.</p>
<p>The default mode network is what&rsquo;s considered</p>
<p>to be like our sense of self and it&rsquo;s part of the brain</p>
<p>that sort of is what I described before,</p>
<p>scanning the world and filtering information</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s really important to us</p>
<p>and both focusing us on things</p>
<p>and also helping us to ignore a lot of things.</p>
<p>And the classic psychedelics all weaken the energy</p>
<p>in this default mode system</p>
<p>and therefore you get this flood of information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not normally paying attention to</p>
<p>and then you start seeing in the more creative waves</p>
<p>or more connected, you actually move to</p>
<p>beyond the verbal kind of thinking</p>
<p>into sort of symbolic thinking a lot of times</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you sometimes get</p>
<p>these mystical sense of connection, how it&rsquo;s all one</p>
<p>and you get the sense also of how big the universe is</p>
<p>and how small each one of us is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin</p>
<p>and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD</p>
<p>and first synthesized psilocybin</p>
<p>on what they call structure activity relationships.</p>
<p>What is the structural molecule</p>
<p>and then how do you predict what that new molecule</p>
<p>that never existed before is going to do</p>
<p>once you actually take it?</p>
<p>And you can get close, but you never really know</p>
<p>until you actually take the drug.</p>
<p>And the way that Sasha ran his experiments</p>
<p>is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses</p>
<p>and he would sort of step up the doses</p>
<p>to have more experiences.</p>
<p>If he thought it was valuable,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d share it with his wife, Ann,</p>
<p>but then what they would do is</p>
<p>if they both thought it was valuable,</p>
<p>they had a group of 12 people</p>
<p>that they were with for many, many years</p>
<p>and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people</p>
<p>and they would get the different perspectives.</p>
<p>And he felt that 12 was like a minimum number</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so unique how each of us see things,</p>
<p>but then you kind of get a little bit of a consensus</p>
<p>on how a lot of people are gonna see it</p>
<p>and then if that 12 people were positive about it,</p>
<p>then they would turn it over to Leo Zeph,</p>
<p>who we called the secret chief,</p>
<p>the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement</p>
<p>and then he would start exploring it in therapy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still a lot of mysteries</p>
<p>as far as structure activity relationships</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna be the case that people go into the lab</p>
<p>and they tinker with molecules</p>
<p>and they know exactly what they&rsquo;re gonna get.</p>
<p>And a lot of it has to do with</p>
<p>not so much chemistry as morphology.</p>
<p>You could say the shape of the molecule</p>
<p>and how does that interact with receptor sites.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re getting better at modeling all of that.</p>
<p>And how does that interaction relate</p>
<p>to the morphing of the human experience</p>
<p>and deeply understanding that perhaps</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no equations yet for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it.</p>
<p>And over time and sort of subjective self report,</p>
<p>like trying to build an understanding</p>
<p>of the effects of the different chemistries.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly.</p>
<p>So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982</p>
<p>and this was after I had done lots of LSD</p>
<p>and mescaline and mushrooms,</p>
<p>I was shocked at how different it was</p>
<p>than these other substances and yet how profound it was.</p>
<p>So are there whole new kind of categories</p>
<p>of classes of drugs that we&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>that would be not so much this like eco dissolution</p>
<p>or emotional?</p>
<p>Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala,</p>
<p>the fear processing part of the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just chemistry, but it routes energy</p>
<p>throughout the brain in a different way.</p>
<p>It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So you think more logically,</p>
<p>that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA.</p>
<p>The other thing it does is it increases connectivity</p>
<p>between the amygdala and the hippocampus.</p>
<p>So it helps facilitate processing of things</p>
<p>into longterm memory.</p>
<p>And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always about to happen.</p>
<p>So will we one time develop drugs</p>
<p>that would even be specific to certain kinds of memories?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda,</p>
<p>who is at the Bronx VA,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s done some studies</p>
<p>that are with the epigenetics of trauma.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s worked with Holocaust survivors and their children,</p>
<p>and she has identified epigenetic mechanisms</p>
<p>by which trauma is passed</p>
<p>from generation to the generations.</p>
<p>Sort of like set points for anxiety,</p>
<p>fear, certain things like that.</p>
<p>But the question is, can you actually transmit memories</p>
<p>from one generation to the next?</p>
<p>Now, this is not DNA changes</p>
<p>which happen over a very long period of time</p>
<p>and evolutionary scale.</p>
<p>But within one lifetime, within some experiences,</p>
<p>your epigenetics, what turns on the genes</p>
<p>or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we know now can be transmitted</p>
<p>from generation to generation,</p>
<p>either by the father or the mother</p>
<p>through the sperm or the egg.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>So what Rachel&rsquo;s gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD</p>
<p>and look at these epigenetic markers before and after</p>
<p>and see if they change as a consequence of therapy.</p>
<p>So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals</p>
<p>that will be able to bring certain kind of memories</p>
<p>to the surface?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not inconceivable.</p>
<p>The epigenetic angle is fascinating,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be these epigenetic perturbations</p>
<p>that lead to memories living</p>
<p>from one generation to the other</p>
<p>and then bringing those memories to the surface</p>
<p>and using that as signal to understand</p>
<p>what exactly the psychedelics bring to the surface and not.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, the other portion of that though is culture.</p>
<p>I mean, culture is where we store all these memories</p>
<p>and in the stories that we get passed out.</p>
<p>Especially with a lot of shared,</p>
<p>you talk about the Holocaust or World War II,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s deeply ingrained in the culture,</p>
<p>the impact of those events</p>
<p>and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives</p>
<p>on that particular event create a set of stories</p>
<p>that you can plug into.</p>
<p>And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you</p>
<p>that creates a memory that&rsquo;s connected to,</p>
<p>like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust,</p>
<p>I think about my own family,</p>
<p>but in some sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also resonating with stories of many others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like somehow the two echo each other</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just providing my own little flavor on top.</p>
<p>The meat of the stories</p>
<p>are probably those that are shared with others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plugging into the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating,</p>
<p>really plugging into like precisely</p>
<p>plugging into particular memories</p>
<p>as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just add that the most important dream</p>
<p>of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor</p>
<p>telling me that he was miraculously saved from death</p>
<p>and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose,</p>
<p>but he never knew what that purpose was.</p>
<p>So in the dream, I&rsquo;m seeing him on his deathbed</p>
<p>and then he shows me whatever happened to him</p>
<p>during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re back in the room on his deathbed</p>
<p>and he says, well, I know what my purpose was now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, great, what was it?</p>
<p>He says, it&rsquo;s to tell you to be a psychedelic therapist</p>
<p>and to study psychedelics</p>
<p>and bring back psychedelic research.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, I&rsquo;ve already decided to do this.</p>
<p>You can lay this on me.</p>
<p>I can say yes and then you can die in peace.</p>
<p>And then he died in front of my eyes in the dream.</p>
<p>So I think that that kind of cultural transmission</p>
<p>that I got from when I was really young,</p>
<p>then manifested in this dream.</p>
<p>And that was this story about how people</p>
<p>can be incredibly vicious</p>
<p>and can be very motivated by irrational factors.</p>
<p>And so I just feel that this kind of</p>
<p>multi generational transmission of this story</p>
<p>of the irrational being a murderous factor</p>
<p>and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>And I would say my guess is more culturally</p>
<p>than this epigenetic mechanism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but your sense is that whatever stimulated</p>
<p>a certain part of human nature in World War II,</p>
<p>especially Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union,</p>
<p>still is within us, within all of us.</p>
<p>Just like what we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>we embody quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil</p>
<p>seems to be one of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a quote from Carl Jung</p>
<p>from just a few years before he died.</p>
<p>What he says, and I&rsquo;ll just paraphrase it is</p>
<p>that we need to understand psychology.</p>
<p>We need to understand who man is,</p>
<p>that the greatest danger to us is man.</p>
<p>There are no other dangers really that impact our species.</p>
<p>And then he goes on to say that</p>
<p>we are the source of all coming evil.</p>
<p>Now this was 15 years or so after World War II.</p>
<p>But yeah, and I&rsquo;d say one of the most important</p>
<p>psychedelic experiences of my life was a DMT experience.</p>
<p>Also Terrence was there, Ralph Metzner,</p>
<p>Andy Weil, a few others.</p>
<p>And we were sitting around at Esalen smoking DMT.</p>
<p>And under the influence of DMT,</p>
<p>which now this was the first time I&rsquo;ve ever smoked DMT,</p>
<p>I had this super rapid fraction of a second,</p>
<p>like dissolving of everything that I,</p>
<p>well, first off I saw a horizontal line,</p>
<p>then I saw a vertical line, then it turned into a color,</p>
<p>red, then it was red, then it turned into cubes,</p>
<p>then it turned into like an MC Escher kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you know, didn&rsquo;t make logical sense.</p>
<p>And then I was gone.</p>
<p>And then it was just this period of five, 10 minutes</p>
<p>of just feeling part of this enormous wave</p>
<p>of billions of years of evolution,</p>
<p>how I had this sense that in my innermost sense</p>
<p>of who I am uniquely individually,</p>
<p>this inner voice that&rsquo;s talking to me</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t develop English,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like a gift to me from millions of people.</p>
<p>So that even in my most innermost sense, it&rsquo;s not just me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the product of everything that came before me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of this bigger system.</p>
<p>And then I just thought, wow,</p>
<p>just how many billions of years does it take</p>
<p>to reach this point of self awareness and all this?</p>
<p>And it was glorious, beautiful.</p>
<p>And then I had this thought,</p>
<p>and this is where this kind of intellectual honesty,</p>
<p>I guess you could say, I just thought,</p>
<p>well, if I&rsquo;m part of everything</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s part of me,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not just the good parts,</p>
<p>that Hitler&rsquo;s part of me too.</p>
<p>And that was just this shock, like a stone sunk,</p>
<p>and I just was very moody for the whole next day.</p>
<p>But it was that acknowledgement</p>
<p>that each of us carries these potentials,</p>
<p>and what we activate is what matters,</p>
<p>but what our potential are is the whole full range of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment</p>
<p>about the DMT trip itself and what it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>starting from the very basic geometric shapes</p>
<p>and then launching yourself into the context</p>
<p>of the enormity of space and time in the human history.</p>
<p>Is there anything else to be said</p>
<p>about that kind of visually or physically</p>
<p>or emotionally about that journey?</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s like, that brief journey that reveals so much?</p>
<p>Well, I was with a group of people.</p>
<p>The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT,</p>
<p>have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes,</p>
<p>and everybody else was just chatting,</p>
<p>and then the person who did the DMT would come back</p>
<p>and tell their story of what happened.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d think about it for a bit</p>
<p>and then pass the pipe to the next person.</p>
<p>And so this was like a whole evening.</p>
<p>So even the, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>even the conversations themselves then</p>
<p>is part of the experience.</p>
<p>Exactly, yes, yes, because it&rsquo;s also what you bring back.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s particularly for therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about what the experience is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what you bring back and what do you integrate.</p>
<p>And then also, how do you learn how to do these things</p>
<p>on your own without the drugs?</p>
<p>There is this way, because we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a core human experience,</p>
<p>the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve seen it and felt it,</p>
<p>then you have a little bit better sense</p>
<p>to recreate it on your own.</p>
<p>Although, I&rsquo;ve had dreams where I&rsquo;ve been doing LSD</p>
<p>and tripping and it was just incredible.</p>
<p>It was, I was tripping in my dreams,</p>
<p>but I had not taken LSD.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this way in which we do that.</p>
<p>So I would say that from the DMT experience,</p>
<p>the sense of safety, that&rsquo;s what I was trying to get at</p>
<p>with this, the group of us and this group of friends</p>
<p>trying to do this common exploration,</p>
<p>that if you have this sense of safety,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re incredibly vulnerable</p>
<p>because you are giving up your awareness really</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening around you.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, what we&rsquo;re finding is that</p>
<p>in our psychedelic research for PTSD</p>
<p>and what we see with the vaccines,</p>
<p>that even African Americans are reluctant</p>
<p>to volunteer for vaccines because they haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>that sense of safety from the medical establishment.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much.</p>
<p>So the overlay has to be this sense of safety</p>
<p>as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I was just actually told about how there&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness.</p>
<p>And so one of the,</p>
<p>Charlene who&rsquo;s my assistant is trying to do work</p>
<p>on helping people in prison with trauma,</p>
<p>potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness.</p>
<p>But one of the exercises was teaching people to,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s how you deal with stress,</p>
<p>just close your eyes and deep breathe.</p>
<p>And what Charlene was saying is people don&rsquo;t close their eyes</p>
<p>in prison, you don&rsquo;t feel safe to do that.</p>
<p>So all that is just to say is that the context</p>
<p>is the most important factor.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;ll talk about the DMT experience,</p>
<p>the context was this supportive sense of safety</p>
<p>that I could be completely vulnerable</p>
<p>and out of any kind of controlled women,</p>
<p>I think often are less safe in this way than men</p>
<p>because of all the sexual assaults.</p>
<p>But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline</p>
<p>to some extent, it opens you up to much more.</p>
<p>And to make a bigger point of that,</p>
<p>we could say that it&rsquo;s very similar</p>
<p>to the Copernican revolution.</p>
<p>And people thought that the earth</p>
<p>was the center of the universe</p>
<p>and the inquisition murdered people that questioned that.</p>
<p>Father Bruno burned at the stake.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the things he said,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s worth all these years later saying</p>
<p>is that when the inquisition sentenced him</p>
<p>to burn at the stake for espousing this idea</p>
<p>that the earth was not really the center of the universe,</p>
<p>he said to the inquisition, he said,</p>
<p>your fear in sentencing me is greater</p>
<p>than my fear in being sentenced.</p>
<p>That their worldview was so rigid</p>
<p>that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it.</p>
<p>And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego</p>
<p>is the center of the universe.</p>
<p>And to realize that we are just rotating</p>
<p>about on something much bigger than our individual life.</p>
<p>Our ego is designed almost to protect this body</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>And you can understand all the good reasons why that is,</p>
<p>but it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.</p>
<p>And so the psychedelics, DMT,</p>
<p>by knocking this sort of ego orientation</p>
<p>or the default mode network offline,</p>
<p>you open up to the bigger sweeps of history.</p>
<p>So in that place of safety and vulnerability</p>
<p>in that fascinating group of people,</p>
<p>when their ego was dissolved in this way,</p>
<p>did they have similar experiences?</p>
<p>Is there different places that their minds went?</p>
<p>Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience</p>
<p>that Hitler&rsquo;s part of me,</p>
<p>no one else in the group had that.</p>
<p>Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before</p>
<p>or they realized that they&rsquo;re not just the good,</p>
<p>the white hat, good people and that they&rsquo;re all good</p>
<p>and we got to fight against the bad people.</p>
<p>So no, people will go in different places.</p>
<p>And not only that, if you do it again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go into a different place</p>
<p>than you went to the first time.</p>
<p>Unless you have not resolved the issue.</p>
<p>So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult,</p>
<p>but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum,</p>
<p>the same challenge that I was unable to overcome.</p>
<p>This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving,</p>
<p>letting the ego fully go.</p>
<p>And I would have this sequence of trips</p>
<p>over a couple of months where I would reach this point</p>
<p>where I was too scared to move forward</p>
<p>and I would just be holding on.</p>
<p>So there are repeated themes sometimes.</p>
<p>What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful,</p>
<p>is that the full expression of an emotion</p>
<p>is the funeral pyre of that emotion.</p>
<p>And what that means is if you can fully let in something,</p>
<p>then the essence of life has changed,</p>
<p>is that it moves on, that everything&rsquo;s in motion.</p>
<p>And if you can fully experience it,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a sense that you&rsquo;re gonna be trapped</p>
<p>in eternity in this hellish state,</p>
<p>if you surrender to that, that&rsquo;s the way out.</p>
<p>This full experience of something</p>
<p>is this funeral pyre of that emotion.</p>
<p>And so that runs against a lot</p>
<p>of what modern psychiatry is doing too,</p>
<p>which is to suppress symptoms.</p>
<p>Instead of supporting people</p>
<p>to kind of explore these insecurities</p>
<p>so that then they can contain them</p>
<p>and then they can move on.</p>
<p>So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Although one of the reasons</p>
<p>why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA</p>
<p>or why there&rsquo;s advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience</p>
<p>is that you have a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>to come up against this resistance</p>
<p>that may be too difficult to deal with</p>
<p>and then you kind of push it aside</p>
<p>and then a couple hours later you come back to it</p>
<p>or you come back to it.</p>
<p>Press snooze every once in a while if you&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do that.</p>
<p>I think with MDMA, you can negotiate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, a part of its safety in a sense.</p>
<p>You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m feeling this, but it&rsquo;s too much for me now.</p>
<p>You can push it away.</p>
<p>But with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>this kind of membrane between the conscious</p>
<p>and the unconscious,</p>
<p>that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane</p>
<p>and things are coming up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to negotiate with it.</p>
<p>The key to successful classic psychedelic trips is surrender.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about that you first began</p>
<p>to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics</p>
<p>when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest</p>
<p>was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part</p>
<p>under the influence of LSD.</p>
<p>So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey,</p>
<p>in writing that incredible book?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s called semantic priming.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that I say night, you say day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of normal patterns of kind of,</p>
<p>you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve done some research.</p>
<p>They, meaning scientists, have done some research</p>
<p>where you give people a psychedelic</p>
<p>and then you do this semantic priming.</p>
<p>And what you find is they have a wider range of associations</p>
<p>than they normally would</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not under psychedelics.</p>
<p>So I think for Ken Kesey,</p>
<p>he was able with psychedelics to get</p>
<p>a deeper kind of emotional connection</p>
<p>to some of these states of mind</p>
<p>that people were in this mental institution</p>
<p>and that he could explore them more in depth</p>
<p>and more eloquently.</p>
<p>And also one of the things he talked about</p>
<p>was the fog machine,</p>
<p>was how people&rsquo;s minds were sort of clouded</p>
<p>by the people that ran the institution</p>
<p>and the fog machine would be coming in.</p>
<p>So I think the imagery and the metaphors</p>
<p>that he used a lot in the book</p>
<p>could come to him during LSD experiences.</p>
<p>And then now he wasn&rsquo;t doing very,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing, you have to be literate.</p>
<p>You have to be able to write.</p>
<p>So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips</p>
<p>instead of at the peak.</p>
<p>But I think you would get a lot of these,</p>
<p>the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors,</p>
<p>I think he would get these extent,</p>
<p>also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended focus</p>
<p>and you can really elaborate on images.</p>
<p>And so much of psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>are poetic and metaphorical.</p>
<p>I mean, you could take veterans</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve never read a book of poetry in their lives.</p>
<p>And under the influence of MDMA,</p>
<p>just what they describe, the imagery</p>
<p>and the way they describe their experiences,</p>
<p>metaphorical, poetic, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel</p>
<p>what LSD did to his mind in a way</p>
<p>that most people couldn&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>that he did because he was trying to write this novel</p>
<p>and because he was so brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;ll talk about psychedelics</p>
<p>and treating, in bringing some of trauma to the surface</p>
<p>and dealing with all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something also to the opening up of creativity</p>
<p>for whether it&rsquo;s for writing purposes</p>
<p>or for in my world for engineering, for invention,</p>
<p>innovation and invention itself is a very,</p>
<p>is a deeply creative process.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics,</p>
<p>what kind of ideas can be brought to life?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena</p>
<p>of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and else microdosing psychedelics</p>
<p>in order to have a little touch more</p>
<p>of this creative approach to things.</p>
<p>I would love it to see if it was,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more like Terrence McKenna territory,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but I would love to sort of more scientific</p>
<p>to where there&rsquo;ll be the rigor</p>
<p>of saying how to do it effectively,</p>
<p>how to sort of understand sort of not just almost,</p>
<p>to take the full journey of creative exploration</p>
<p>and to do it for prolonged periods of time,</p>
<p>for years, lifelong kind of part of your life</p>
<p>of how it empowers creativity.</p>
<p>I think, of course, you start with helping people</p>
<p>deal with trauma, and then the next step</p>
<p>is people who have moved past their trauma</p>
<p>and are trying to do something,</p>
<p>create something special in their life.</p>
<p>How can then psychedelics empower that?</p>
<p>Yeah, now, that also,</p>
<p>just to not shy away from anything controversial,</p>
<p>that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest,</p>
<p>particularly for younger people.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re sort of moving</p>
<p>into this adulting kind of phase</p>
<p>and you have to figure out</p>
<p>what are you gonna do with your life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many options.</p>
<p>A lot of people, of course, feel constrained</p>
<p>that they have very few options,</p>
<p>but I think this idea of psychedelics</p>
<p>as a way to help you find your calling</p>
<p>or find your vision or find your unique leverage point,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see that more and more</p>
<p>as our culture evolves and gets healthier</p>
<p>around the use of psychedelics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the science,</p>
<p>having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely</p>
<p>and the culture catching up</p>
<p>to the fact that this is both safe and very useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety.</p>
<p>So we can understand physiological risks</p>
<p>and we can minimize them.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s very minimal physiological risks</p>
<p>from the classic psychedelics, virtually none,</p>
<p>or for even MDMA under safe conditions.</p>
<p>Psychological risks are harder to address,</p>
<p>but we can do that through the sense of safety and support.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a level of risk there</p>
<p>that we shouldn&rsquo;t overlook.</p>
<p>And so to make a drug into a medicine,</p>
<p>what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction</p>
<p>of the FDA and other regulatory agencies</p>
<p>that things are safe and efficacious.</p>
<p>But even though they use those words,</p>
<p>proving safety and safe and efficacious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in relationship to the disease</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to treat</p>
<p>and you accept a certain amount of risk.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer</p>
<p>because fascinating him being.</p>
<p>He was also part of Project MKUltra.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>What was Project MKUltra</p>
<p>and what lessons we should take away from it?</p>
<p>Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA.</p>
<p>What they were looking at was,</p>
<p>can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs,</p>
<p>and weaponize them in different ways</p>
<p>for interrogation, for true serums,</p>
<p>for exposing somebody before they give a big talk</p>
<p>to something like LSD and then they can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>or make a fool of themselves?</p>
<p>Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield</p>
<p>and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons</p>
<p>and then you just walk up and nobody dies</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve won the battle?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fascinating concept.</p>
<p>Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One way to win a war is to enforce peace.</p>
<p>To get everybody not caring about the war, but yes.</p>
<p>Well, I think Gandhi said something even better,</p>
<p>which is that the true way to win a war</p>
<p>is to turn your enemy into your friend.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but MKUltra was really nefarious</p>
<p>and it was part of our military and it was done in secret</p>
<p>and they would dose people against their will.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the most infamous things</p>
<p>was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco</p>
<p>and they would have one way mirrors, all this stuff</p>
<p>and then they would just dose people with LSD</p>
<p>and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD</p>
<p>and observe what they would do and how they would act.</p>
<p>And the CIA actually for a while</p>
<p>was dosing each other secretly</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a famous case of this fellow Olson</p>
<p>that either jumped out of a window or was pushed,</p>
<p>he might&rsquo;ve been killed.</p>
<p>He was a CIA guy and they gave him LSD</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re trying to see can they break him down</p>
<p>and get him to tell secrets.</p>
<p>And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him</p>
<p>while he was under the influence of LSD</p>
<p>and whether he was pushed or not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever know.</p>
<p>But MKUltra was violating people&rsquo;s human rights.</p>
<p>It was done in secret and the irony of it</p>
<p>is that Ken Kesey is one of the people,</p>
<p>one of the main early people that got LSD in this context</p>
<p>and then he was one of the main people</p>
<p>that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics</p>
<p>to oppose the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>So I think the CIA kind of in many cases,</p>
<p>things get out of their control,</p>
<p>what they think they can do</p>
<p>and it turned in to be a disaster for them.</p>
<p>I think there was some thought</p>
<p>that some of the people at the CIA had</p>
<p>is that if you can turn people inside,</p>
<p>take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be involved politically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to sort of take people offline.</p>
<p>And what I don&rsquo;t think they counted on</p>
<p>is that when you&rsquo;re offline</p>
<p>and you have these unit of special experiences</p>
<p>and you realize how we&rsquo;re all connected,</p>
<p>then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese</p>
<p>and put one dictator over another dictator,</p>
<p>dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?</p>
<p>Why are we doing that?</p>
<p>So MKUltra has just a very disreputable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning more and more about what they did</p>
<p>and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey</p>
<p>and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead</p>
<p>who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping</p>
<p>to organize and out of that emerged,</p>
<p>you could say just this incredible psychedelic culture.</p>
<p>And you look at the bands that began in the 60s</p>
<p>and which ones have really survived to this day</p>
<p>and the Grateful Dead has survived longer</p>
<p>than most any other band.</p>
<p>I mean, some of them have died and all,</p>
<p>but it was like the tightness,</p>
<p>the sort of telepathy we talked about before</p>
<p>that they could just get so tuned in to each other</p>
<p>and each other&rsquo;s energies and they could do improvisations</p>
<p>and they can do this incredible work</p>
<p>that I think the sustainability of the Grateful Dead</p>
<p>as a group was a testament</p>
<p>to the power of the LSD experiences</p>
<p>and that might&rsquo;ve never happened if not for MKUltra.</p>
<p>But can we talk about the darkness a little bit?</p>
<p>So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly part</p>
<p>of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard.</p>
<p>Do you think this is true?</p>
<p>Do you think it had an impact</p>
<p>on him psychologically, intellectually and so on?</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s true and I do think it had an impact.</p>
<p>So we talked before about are these drugs somehow</p>
<p>or other producing a certain kind of drug experience</p>
<p>or do they bring out what&rsquo;s within?</p>
<p>So we have this experience, yeah, on the one hand,</p>
<p>Ken Kesey and he sort of took positive things out of this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can get this opposition</p>
<p>to the modern world, to technology</p>
<p>and to the point of creating bombs to try to go after it.</p>
<p>So that the experience is not in the drug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this interaction between the drug,</p>
<p>the person, the context.</p>
<p>And so we can heal people with psychedelics</p>
<p>or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics.</p>
<p>It depends again on the context.</p>
<p>And so I think both these things can be true.</p>
<p>And I think it was really good</p>
<p>that you kind of highlighted this,</p>
<p>that there is this polarities and that it&rsquo;s not in the drug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the other factors and it&rsquo;s who they were beforehand</p>
<p>and then how you use that experience.</p>
<p>So all that&rsquo;s to say is if we put LSD in the water</p>
<p>and everybody were to get it,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of a sudden</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s gonna have a mystical experience</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s all we need to do</p>
<p>and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the drug.</p>
<p>And that actually is why for me,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve also talked about engineering new psychedelics</p>
<p>and all the people that are gonna be trying</p>
<p>for profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics.</p>
<p>For me, the most important challenge</p>
<p>is new cultural contexts that can create legality,</p>
<p>safety, support for the existing psychedelics</p>
<p>that we already have.</p>
<p>I mean, we have so much incredible tools</p>
<p>in these existing psychedelics</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more about creating context for them</p>
<p>to be used in safe medical or personal growth</p>
<p>or recreational even with harm reduction,</p>
<p>all these different ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more important to me than finding some new molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat similar or somewhat different</p>
<p>but it can be patented.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the social context.</p>
<p>So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra</p>
<p>and I think it affected him in a negative way</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a cautionary tale that it&rsquo;s not in the drug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the context.</p>
<p>The context, the person, still it feels like if viewed</p>
<p>from a therapy perspective, perhaps there was a way</p>
<p>to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path</p>
<p>out of the darkness.</p>
<p>I think so and I think that this is where I think MDMA</p>
<p>comes in in a way that MDMA is, he felt very isolated</p>
<p>and very much out of society in some ways.</p>
<p>MDMA stimulates oxytocin, which we haven&rsquo;t mentioned,</p>
<p>which is the hormone of nursing mothers,</p>
<p>of love and connection.</p>
<p>It provides a lot of this sense of self acceptance</p>
<p>and safety and wanting to be in a relationship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Gould Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s given octopuses MDMA, they&rsquo;re solitary creatures</p>
<p>except mating season, which is not very often</p>
<p>but you give them MDMA and they become more interested</p>
<p>in hanging out with other octopuses.</p>
<p>So I think this, for people that have had difficult</p>
<p>psychedelic experiences, MDMA helps them integrate them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience</p>
<p>40 years before and are still able to get back to that</p>
<p>under the influence of MDMA and work out some</p>
<p>of the conflicts that they weren&rsquo;t able to resolve</p>
<p>all those decades before.</p>
<p>So I think that psychedelics could have been helpful</p>
<p>in a different context for Ted Kaczynski.</p>
<p>But the other big part of it is that people have to be</p>
<p>willing to cooperate with the experience.</p>
<p>We talked about resistance.</p>
<p>So people can resist these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the saying is you can bring a horse to water</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t make them drink.</p>
<p>This is about how people have to be willing</p>
<p>to go to these spaces.</p>
<p>So one of the essence of our therapeutic approach</p>
<p>is that we help people to heal themselves,</p>
<p>that we are not giving them the healing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flip on the power dynamics that existed,</p>
<p>you would say in the fifties and sixties,</p>
<p>my dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods</p>
<p>and whatever they said was right.</p>
<p>And we no longer, of course, believe that.</p>
<p>But for a while, psychoanalysis with Freud,</p>
<p>that they gave the interpretation to the patient.</p>
<p>The patient couldn&rsquo;t help themselves</p>
<p>but they would do the free associations</p>
<p>and the psychoanalyst would see these conflicts</p>
<p>and would be the one that does the healing,</p>
<p>would give this interpretation and that would open things up.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s this idea of empowering people</p>
<p>to heal themselves.</p>
<p>And so if Ted Kuznicki had been in a therapeutic setting</p>
<p>with psychedelics and if they&rsquo;d had something</p>
<p>like MDMA available or MDA,</p>
<p>which was popular during the sixties,</p>
<p>which is a more like MDMA LSD combination,</p>
<p>the outcomes might&rsquo;ve been different.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step into the world of studies.</p>
<p>Timothy Leary, who was he</p>
<p>and what were the most important ideas</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve learned from him?</p>
<p>Well, I did have the opportunity to get to know him personally</p>
<p>and to spend some time with him.</p>
<p>Timothy Leary, well, let&rsquo;s start with Nixon saying</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the most dangerous man in America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good place to start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And why did Nixon say that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of this turn on, tune in, drop out.</p>
<p>Timothy Leary was just an incredible advocate</p>
<p>for think for yourself, question authority.</p>
<p>Those were the things he said all the time.</p>
<p>Think for yourself, question authority.</p>
<p>He was a rebel.</p>
<p>He was kicked out of West Point.</p>
<p>He was a psychologist who was at Harvard for three years</p>
<p>from 60 to 63.</p>
<p>Before he got to Harvard,</p>
<p>he had an experience with mushrooms in Mexico.</p>
<p>And he said he learned more in that experience</p>
<p>than he&rsquo;d had in his entire academic career before then</p>
<p>about how the human mind works.</p>
<p>And so he came to Harvard wanting to do research</p>
<p>into psychedelics.</p>
<p>And he did some very important studies, both of which,</p>
<p>well, one was called the Good Friday Experiment,</p>
<p>which was whether psychedelics in religiously inclined</p>
<p>people taking psilocybin in a religious setting,</p>
<p>whether it could produce a mystical experience.</p>
<p>That took place at Marsh Chapel at the Boston University.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a little bit subjective,</p>
<p>where you can say entirely subjective,</p>
<p>what people describe happens to them.</p>
<p>He wanted to do another study,</p>
<p>which would be a more objective measure,</p>
<p>and that was called the Concord Prison Experiment.</p>
<p>And that was the thought, if you can give people</p>
<p>psilocybin mystical sense of connection type experiences</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re in prison, when they get out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be more pro social and they&rsquo;ll have reduced</p>
<p>recidivism.</p>
<p>So Tim did that.</p>
<p>He also did the naturalistic studies</p>
<p>of giving loads of people psilocybin</p>
<p>and sort of writing down what their experiences were,</p>
<p>the range of experiences.</p>
<p>Later on in his time at Harvard,</p>
<p>they started doing LSD.</p>
<p>And LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting,</p>
<p>not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin.</p>
<p>Sometimes he used to say that if they never got into LSD,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d still be at Harvard with the psilocybin.</p>
<p>So he was a great American psychologist,</p>
<p>but then he got tired of the psychology game,</p>
<p>you could say, or he would say that.</p>
<p>He got more and more interested in cultural change</p>
<p>and various musicians and artists</p>
<p>and all sorts of people started coming to him</p>
<p>for the psychedelic experience that they are in a way</p>
<p>for creativity, for other things.</p>
<p>So he started hanging out with all sorts of famous people</p>
<p>or creative people and he stopped going to classes a lot.</p>
<p>And Ram Dass, Richard Alpert had given LSD to a student</p>
<p>that Ram Dass was courageous enough to admit</p>
<p>that he had a sexual interest in.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t supposed to give it undergraduates.</p>
<p>That was about the only time that they ever did it.</p>
<p>And psychedelics just getting more and more controversial</p>
<p>even in the early 60s, eventually got kicked out of Harvard</p>
<p>and then he became kind of a cultural icon</p>
<p>for the counterculture and was hounded by the police</p>
<p>and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s an incredible person.</p>
<p>One thing that Ram Dass said is that Richard Alpert,</p>
<p>Ram Dass said, I&rsquo;m a rascal, but Leary&rsquo;s a scoundrel.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the distinction?</p>
<p>Rascals like in good fun.</p>
<p>A scoundrel is like, you can&rsquo;t quite trust them, I think.</p>
<p>I think that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a spectrum of sorts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that Leary was someone</p>
<p>who a little bit got addicted to media attention.</p>
<p>But I think that overall he gets blamed a lot</p>
<p>for the backlash against the 60s,</p>
<p>the shutdown of psychedelic research.</p>
<p>I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that.</p>
<p>I think when you look back at the 60s,</p>
<p>the common narrative is that it was</p>
<p>because psychedelics going wrong.</p>
<p>People took psychedelics, they weren&rsquo;t prepared,</p>
<p>they had emotional breakdowns, they weren&rsquo;t psychotic,</p>
<p>they killed themselves, they did this or that,</p>
<p>different problems of people taking psychedelics</p>
<p>in context that they didn&rsquo;t feel fairly safe in</p>
<p>or just they weren&rsquo;t prepared</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t know how much they were taking</p>
<p>or all this.</p>
<p>So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong.</p>
<p>But I think the real reason, while that did happen,</p>
<p>I think the real reason is psychedelics going right</p>
<p>and people having this sense of connection.</p>
<p>And then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping</p>
<p>that it would kind of turn people inward</p>
<p>and take them away from political struggles,</p>
<p>it actually motivated people.</p>
<p>Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences,</p>
<p>your attitude towards death changes also</p>
<p>this idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural cycle, it&rsquo;s not so much.</p>
<p>So I think people realize that,</p>
<p>while there&rsquo;s this billions of years of evolution,</p>
<p>infinity, whatever that means in terms of time,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re here for a very limited time</p>
<p>and they end up wanting to use their time well,</p>
<p>they have a lessened fear of death</p>
<p>and they wanna build this paradise on earth here now</p>
<p>instead of later.</p>
<p>So a lot of people really did get motivated</p>
<p>to challenge the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>to work on the environmental movement,</p>
<p>civil rights movement, women&rsquo;s rights movement,</p>
<p>anti militarism.</p>
<p>And it was that challenge to the status quo</p>
<p>that caused the backlash.</p>
<p>So Leary is someone who in 1990,</p>
<p>we had the maps I started in 86.</p>
<p>So in 1990, we had this conference</p>
<p>to raise money out in California</p>
<p>and Leary was there and Ram Dass was there</p>
<p>and Ralph Metzner was there and Andy Weil was there</p>
<p>and Terrence McKenna was there</p>
<p>and Dennis McKenna was there and all these.</p>
<p>But there was one point where Tim was speaking</p>
<p>and afterwards I was asking him some questions.</p>
<p>And I said, do you have any advice for us</p>
<p>on how to work with the government</p>
<p>and how to bring these psychedelics forward?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this nonprofit for it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to do this research.</p>
<p>What is your advice on how to bring this forward</p>
<p>and how to work with the government?</p>
<p>And he said, fuck the government.</p>
<p>He said, I am so far past asking for permission</p>
<p>for anything, but I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>And then he held up my hand like passing the torch.</p>
<p>So it was, and that&rsquo;s one of my favorite photographs</p>
<p>of me and Tim where he&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>but it was after this, fuck the government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so far past asking for permission for anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad that you are.</p>
<p>Now I did follow ups to the Good Friday experiment</p>
<p>and I did follow ups, 25 year follow up</p>
<p>to the Good Friday experiment,</p>
<p>about a 34 year follow up</p>
<p>to the Concord Prison experiment.</p>
<p>What I discovered in some ways I would say</p>
<p>is the key to the 60s, what I just told you,</p>
<p>but in the follow up to the Good Friday experiment</p>
<p>that I did in the 80s for my undergraduate thesis</p>
<p>at New College in Sarasota, Florida,</p>
<p>I eventually found 19 out of the 20 people.</p>
<p>It was just, that was an enormous challenge</p>
<p>because their names were all lost</p>
<p>and it just took forever years and years and years</p>
<p>to find them all.</p>
<p>But I discovered that those people</p>
<p>that had the psilocybin experience</p>
<p>in the midst of 25 years later with Nancy Reagan</p>
<p>and Ronald Reagan, and if there ever were there</p>
<p>a social pressure to disavow the validity</p>
<p>of the psychedelic experience, that was then.</p>
<p>And instead they affirmed it,</p>
<p>that they thought with all of this years of hindsight,</p>
<p>now looking back, they thought it was</p>
<p>a valid mystical experience.</p>
<p>But I discovered that one of the persons</p>
<p>who had the psilocybin had this experience</p>
<p>during the Good Friday service</p>
<p>that Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister.</p>
<p>He was Martin Luther King&rsquo;s mentor</p>
<p>and Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister</p>
<p>at Boston at Marsh Chapel.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King got his PhD at Boston University.</p>
<p>And Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi.</p>
<p>And so he was really kind of this hidden person</p>
<p>behind the civil rights movement</p>
<p>about nonviolence as their strategy.</p>
<p>But he was interested in the political implications</p>
<p>of the mystical experience.</p>
<p>So he permitted this experiment to take place.</p>
<p>And there were 20 divinity students</p>
<p>from Andover Newton in the basement</p>
<p>and 10 experimenters, all the people on religion</p>
<p>and psychology, like Houston Smith and Walter Huston Clarke</p>
<p>and Leary and Ramdas, Mr. Others were there</p>
<p>as a support part of it.</p>
<p>And the sermon was like three hours later.</p>
<p>We actually have, three hours long,</p>
<p>we actually have the original sermon</p>
<p>from the Good Friday experiment</p>
<p>from Howard Thurman up on our website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But part of it was tell people there&rsquo;s a man on the cross.</p>
<p>And this one person sort of heard that</p>
<p>and he thought, okay, I gotta do that.</p>
<p>Howard Thurman was such a dynamic speaker.</p>
<p>He said, I gotta tell people there&rsquo;s a man on the cross.</p>
<p>And so he said, what am I doing here</p>
<p>in this basement chapel listening to this service?</p>
<p>I gotta go tell people there&rsquo;s a man on the cross.</p>
<p>So he went, they thought he was just going to the bathroom,</p>
<p>but he ran out the door.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running down Commonwealth Avenue</p>
<p>and Houston Smith and Tim Leary go after him.</p>
<p>And he had thought that since he should tell somebody,</p>
<p>he should tell the president, like why not?</p>
<p>But then he realized, well, the president&rsquo;s in Washington.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here in Boston.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell the president of the university.</p>
<p>So anyway, he&rsquo;s running down the street</p>
<p>and Leary and Houston Smith go after him.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t want to go back inside.</p>
<p>They finally get him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not hit by a car,</p>
<p>but they end up giving him a shot of Thorazine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Thorazine?</p>
<p>Thorazine is like a major antipsychotic drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible drug, but it knocks people out,</p>
<p>tranquilizes them.</p>
<p>We would never do that today.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t abort a difficult experience like that.</p>
<p>But in any case, they hid that.</p>
<p>That was not part of the writeup of this experiment.</p>
<p>So what they did is in a sense,</p>
<p>a little bit exaggerated the benefits.</p>
<p>It later became out three years later after the experiment</p>
<p>or four years in Time Magazine,</p>
<p>it said everybody that got psilocybin</p>
<p>had a mystical experience.</p>
<p>Say it wasn&rsquo;t true, not everybody.</p>
<p>Eight out of the 10 did, but not all 10, not this guy.</p>
<p>And they minimize the risks.</p>
<p>So there was a bit of that.</p>
<p>I think Tim was reckless in that way.</p>
<p>It was underplayed the risks and overpromised the benefits.</p>
<p>And then the Concord Prison experiment,</p>
<p>it turned out that Tim had fudged the data completely</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t really successful.</p>
<p>So I fault him for that.</p>
<p>The outside world was doing the opposite.</p>
<p>It was exaggerating the risks and blocking research.</p>
<p>So he felt justified to fudge the data</p>
<p>because the outside world was fudging in a sense,</p>
<p>the response to the.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that presents a very nice context.</p>
<p>Fuck the government, but I&rsquo;m glad that somebody</p>
<p>is fighting the good fight from within</p>
<p>and doing it the right way, which is where you are.</p>
<p>So the 80s, let me ask, what is MAPS,</p>
<p>the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</p>
<p>and what is its mission throughout the years,</p>
<p>throughout the decades?</p>
<p>Yeah, so MAPS is a nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>I created it as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>I created it in 86 after DEA,</p>
<p>the Drug Enforcement Administration,</p>
<p>criminalized MDMA in 1985.</p>
<p>And that was after they started trying to do that in 1984.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, this Terence McKenna is sponsoring,</p>
<p>motivating us to do this safety study.</p>
<p>So we did that in preparation for this eventual crackdown</p>
<p>because MDMA was called Adam, used as a therapy drug,</p>
<p>but it was also beginning to be sold as ecstasy</p>
<p>as a party drug.</p>
<p>And that was taking place in public settings and bars.</p>
<p>And so it was inevitable that the crackdown would happen.</p>
<p>And so I had a nonprofit connected to Buckminster Fuller,</p>
<p>Earth Metabolic Design Lab,</p>
<p>that we used to support this lawsuit against the DEA</p>
<p>to block them from criminalizing MDMA.</p>
<p>We were winning in the court of public opinion</p>
<p>and winning in the court.</p>
<p>The DEA freaked out</p>
<p>and the emergency scheduled MDMA in 85.</p>
<p>The handwriting was on the wall</p>
<p>that they were not gonna permit</p>
<p>the therapeutic use to continue</p>
<p>because it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war</p>
<p>and these are terrible drugs.</p>
<p>So in 86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma</p>
<p>because the strategy that I realized is that</p>
<p>Americans are open to medicines,</p>
<p>that tools to ease suffering,</p>
<p>that was the opening wedge,</p>
<p>the opening door to changing attitudes.</p>
<p>And it would be through science.</p>
<p>I would say that my religion is more science</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>And culture and religion are metaphorical,</p>
<p>but often too much they become literal.</p>
<p>But I felt that through science, through medicine,</p>
<p>there would be a way to bring these drugs</p>
<p>back to the surface.</p>
<p>And the mission was always this mass mental health,</p>
<p>this idea that what we need is to spiritualize humanity.</p>
<p>Einstein said the splitting of the atom</p>
<p>has changed everything except our mode of thinking.</p>
<p>And hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe,</p>
<p>which shall be required if mankind is to survive</p>
<p>is a whole new mode of thinking.</p>
<p>So what is that new mode of thinking?</p>
<p>My presumption is that it&rsquo;s more of this mystical sense</p>
<p>of thinking that we&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>And then if we realize that we&rsquo;re all connected,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna blow up the world.</p>
<p>So a lot of people say that if we could just give LSD</p>
<p>all to the world leaders, that would be,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;d have these spiritual experiences,</p>
<p>the world would be better.</p>
<p>But I actually had a ketamine experience</p>
<p>the day after that DMT experience I described</p>
<p>with the inner Hitler.</p>
<p>This ketamine experience was,</p>
<p>I was above and behind Hitler as he was giving a speech,</p>
<p>like the Nuremberg rallies kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I was trying to think, how do I get into his head?</p>
<p>How do I undo what he wants to do?</p>
<p>How can we deal with him?</p>
<p>And I realized this whole new thing</p>
<p>about the Heil Hitler salute.</p>
<p>And he would like push energy out</p>
<p>and then everybody would do the salute back to him.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like the one to the many</p>
<p>and the many to the one,</p>
<p>giving all these people giving away their power</p>
<p>and then how it would just sort of ratchet up in intensity</p>
<p>like these vibrations.</p>
<p>And I realized there&rsquo;s no way to get into his head.</p>
<p>This idea we&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>about you have to be willing.</p>
<p>So what that sort of helped me understand</p>
<p>is that the strategy has to be mass mental health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about changing a few leaders.</p>
<p>We need to change the mass of humanity</p>
<p>to this new mode of thinking, this new spiritual way.</p>
<p>So MAPS was a nonprofit pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>focused on psychedelics.</p>
<p>Big Pharma wasn&rsquo;t doing this work.</p>
<p>Government wasn&rsquo;t funding it.</p>
<p>So the only source of funds</p>
<p>I thought would be through nonprofit donations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been true up until just a couple of years ago</p>
<p>now that we have the rise of these for profits.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve cleared out</p>
<p>the regulatory obstacles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got more scientific data about the benefits</p>
<p>funded through philanthropy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve changed public opinion</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot less zeal for the drug war.</p>
<p>So all of those things have changed.</p>
<p>But at the time it was mass mental health was the goal.</p>
<p>Two tracks, one was drug development,</p>
<p>the other was drug policy reform.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s not just available to people</p>
<p>that have a clinical diagnosis,</p>
<p>but people who are personal growth</p>
<p>or they should have access to it as well.</p>
<p>I did not know at the time that no drug</p>
<p>had ever been made into a medicine by a nonprofit.</p>
<p>That was really good I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve been a little bit more daunted.</p>
<p>And actually that didn&rsquo;t happen for 13 more years.</p>
<p>It happened in 1999.</p>
<p>And that was the abortion pill, RU46,</p>
<p>that was approved in Europe, but it&rsquo;s controversial.</p>
<p>Nobody, no pharmaceutical company would take it.</p>
<p>And it was John D. Rockefeller the third</p>
<p>through the population council</p>
<p>with the major donor being Warren Buffet.</p>
<p>And the Rockefellers and the Buffets</p>
<p>and some of the Pritzkers were involved in funding this.</p>
<p>So that was the first nonprofit.</p>
<p>But the MAPS was designed as from the very beginning,</p>
<p>not academic research into psychedelics,</p>
<p>but drug development.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fundamental distinction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think we&rsquo;re years ahead now</p>
<p>with everybody else in terms of making</p>
<p>a psychedelic assisted therapy into a medicine.</p>
<p>Because our goal from the very beginning was not knowledge,</p>
<p>not academic research, it was practical.</p>
<p>It was drug development.</p>
<p>How do we create new social structures?</p>
<p>How do we create legal access to these things?</p>
<p>Now, in December of 2014,</p>
<p>we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.</p>
<p>So MAPS is a nonprofit, but in our 35 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve raised about $110 million in donations.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know when I started MAPS,</p>
<p>and it took me quite a few years,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know this till about eight, nine years ago,</p>
<p>was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill</p>
<p>to create incentives for developing drugs</p>
<p>that were off patent.</p>
<p>So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the public domain.</p>
<p>These incentives are called data exclusivity,</p>
<p>which means that if you make a drug into a medicine</p>
<p>that has no patent protection,</p>
<p>nobody can use your data for a period of time</p>
<p>to market a generic.</p>
<p>And that will effectively be,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s five years, you do pediatric studies,</p>
<p>you get six months extension,</p>
<p>and we are being required, if we succeed in adults,</p>
<p>to work with adolescents with PTSD.</p>
<p>It blocks a generic competitor</p>
<p>from applying till that five and a half years is over,</p>
<p>takes FDA at least six months to review.</p>
<p>So more or less six years of data exclusivity,</p>
<p>10 years in Europe is data exclusivity.</p>
<p>So the story then became to the donors</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not gonna have to give us money forever</p>
<p>because we can make money selling MDMA,</p>
<p>but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say.</p>
<p>One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy,</p>
<p>but the other is marketing drugs.</p>
<p>When you market it with the profit maximization motive,</p>
<p>we end up in the extreme getting the distortions</p>
<p>that we have in America,</p>
<p>where we have the most expensive healthcare system</p>
<p>in the world per capita,</p>
<p>but our outcomes are down like 40 or 50 among the countries,</p>
<p>our average outcomes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have, third of the people or so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have insurance, and it&rsquo;s just very inequitable.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is show a different way to market drugs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a modification of capitalism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the benefit corporation,</p>
<p>where you maximize public benefit, not profit.</p>
<p>You still make a profit.</p>
<p>So selling MDMA for a profit</p>
<p>is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s taxable, it&rsquo;s a business.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation,</p>
<p>which is 100% owned by the nonprofit.</p>
<p>So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company.</p>
<p>And the mission of that pharma company</p>
<p>is to maximize not profit,</p>
<p>but maximize benefit for society.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Although there still will be profits,</p>
<p>and the profits that we&rsquo;re gonna make</p>
<p>are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS,</p>
<p>which is again, is this mass mental health</p>
<p>and ending the drug war.</p>
<p>And in fact, we&rsquo;ve hired the Boston Consulting Group</p>
<p>to help us plot our commercialization strategy.</p>
<p>And so there is some suggestions based,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many different assumptions in this,</p>
<p>the number of therapists that we train,</p>
<p>the price that we set for the MDMA,</p>
<p>whether insurance companies will cover it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s the possibility of somewhere in the range</p>
<p>of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits</p>
<p>during this period of data exclusivity,</p>
<p>just from the US and we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>trying to do this research around the world as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the Benefit Corporation is.</p>
<p>The Benefit Corporation is our pharmaceutical arm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about 130 people now,</p>
<p>somewhere in that fluctuates,</p>
<p>but one third of them are in the nonprofit.</p>
<p>We do harm reduction, psychedelic harm reduction.</p>
<p>We help create programs for people</p>
<p>with difficult psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>at Burning Man, at festivals all over the world,</p>
<p>even in cities we&rsquo;re now negotiating with the police,</p>
<p>the city of Denver, because Denver has made the mushrooms</p>
<p>the lowest enforcement priority.</p>
<p>Oregon has passed the Oregon psilocybin initiative.</p>
<p>So in those areas where maybe more people</p>
<p>are gonna gravitate to do psychedelics,</p>
<p>we want there to be harm reduction</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t have bad stories coming up</p>
<p>that would change that.</p>
<p>So MAPS does the psychedelic harm reduction.</p>
<p>We do public education.</p>
<p>We do a lot of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you and I are doing right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing that now.</p>
<p>But also research towards.</p>
<p>Well, the research now is done in the Benefit Corp.</p>
<p>In the Benefit Corp.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what happens is people donate to MAPS,</p>
<p>get a tax deduction, MAPS transfers the money,</p>
<p>or you could say invests in the Benefit Corp.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The Benefit Corp will do the research</p>
<p>and then MAPS is the sponsor,</p>
<p>but then we will license the sale of MDMA</p>
<p>to the Benefit Corp, so.</p>
<p>Got it, but the research is done with an eye</p>
<p>towards creating something that has a big impact</p>
<p>versus just research for knowledge&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, because I&rsquo;m interested in political change.</p>
<p>The other part of it, which is that the brain</p>
<p>is the most complex thing we know in the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s endless.</p>
<p>I mean, when are we gonna really, like this idea of,</p>
<p>will we figure out telepathy?</p>
<p>Will we figure out tapping into the collective unconscious?</p>
<p>What is the extents of our brain?</p>
<p>How does the brain actually work?</p>
<p>Do you ask chemistry questions?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s just the pursuit of knowledge,</p>
<p>that is an endless thing.</p>
<p>And how does that end the drug war?</p>
<p>How does that help people directly?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re focused on drug development</p>
<p>more than mechanism of action.</p>
<p>Before I ask you about one,</p>
<p>but several really exciting studies,</p>
<p>let me ask sort of a personal question for me.</p>
<p>So if I wanted to get psychedelics</p>
<p>from the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation</p>
<p>and explore my own mind, how do I get to do that?</p>
<p>And when?</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be able to.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>Because the reason is because the Benefit Corp</p>
<p>is designed as a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>So we can only work on clinical indication.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you come to me and you just say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m really depressed.</p>
<p>Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression</p>
<p>or overcome my PTSD?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to do research in those indications.</p>
<p>And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor.</p>
<p>So this would be prescribed in theory by doctors.</p>
<p>Well, this would go through a doctor and a prescription.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask another question.</p>
<p>To further answer,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s where the drug policy arm comes in,</p>
<p>the drug policy reform.</p>
<p>So you should be able to get access to psychedelics</p>
<p>for your own personal growth.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not medicine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we need to medicalize,</p>
<p>to have things covered by insurance,</p>
<p>to change people&rsquo;s attitudes, the public attitudes.</p>
<p>And then we get this subsequent drug policy reform.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about it</p>
<p>in terms of licensed legalization.</p>
<p>So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics,</p>
<p>you get a little education stuff,</p>
<p>and then you should be able to buy it</p>
<p>and do it on your own.</p>
<p>So let me rephrase the question in more specifically.</p>
<p>So when can I, if I happen to have ailments of some kind</p>
<p>where the doctor decides that psychedelics could help,</p>
<p>when would you be a loose estimate for you</p>
<p>of when a doctor will be able to prescribe to me</p>
<p>something from MAPS Public Benefit Co.</p>
<p>And then when for my personal growth and creativity,</p>
<p>would I be able to get something?</p>
<p>So like, just looking out, this isn&rsquo;t like guaranteed,</p>
<p>but like your vision, your hope for,</p>
<p>yeah, for psychedelics in society.</p>
<p>Well, the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now,</p>
<p>we anticipate FDA approval</p>
<p>for the prescription use of MDMA for PTSD.</p>
<p>Because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine,</p>
<p>there is what&rsquo;s called off label prescription.</p>
<p>What that means, the label is what it&rsquo;s approved for.</p>
<p>So the label will say, oh, this is approved for PTSD.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you come and anything else, social anxiety</p>
<p>or whatever, you can go to the doctor,</p>
<p>they can give it to you.</p>
<p>It might not be covered by insurance,</p>
<p>they have to be a little bit careful about malpractice.</p>
<p>But I think the end of 2023</p>
<p>is when you will be able to do that.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s actually another program, very limited,</p>
<p>called Expanded Access, which is compassionate use,</p>
<p>which means that, and we have approval for 50 people</p>
<p>for compassionate use right now, we think that&rsquo;ll grow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna open up in about two months.</p>
<p>And so those are people with PTSD,</p>
<p>they have to be treatment resistant,</p>
<p>nothing has worked for them.</p>
<p>And they can access MDMA</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re doing the phase three studies.</p>
<p>But they have to pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>The sponsor has to pay for all the research.</p>
<p>But Expanded Access, because there&rsquo;s no control group,</p>
<p>everybody gets the MDMA, people can pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>And we think that&rsquo;ll start in a couple months.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very limited, it&rsquo;s limited to certain cities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a program called Right to Try,</p>
<p>which is passed through Congress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to this idea of compassionate use,</p>
<p>but it cuts the FDA out of it.</p>
<p>And patients can negotiate directly with pharma companies</p>
<p>to get access to their drugs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s starting to happen, I think, in Canada now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re letting people have compassionate access</p>
<p>to psilocybin for life threatening illness,</p>
<p>because there has been studies with psilocybin</p>
<p>for cancer patients and others with life threatening illness.</p>
<p>As far as your question about when will you be able</p>
<p>to access this for personal growth outside of medicine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that to mean fully legally,</p>
<p>where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere,</p>
<p>when will that happen?</p>
<p>We already are starting to see the decriminalization</p>
<p>in certain areas of plant psychedelics.</p>
<p>And we see overall drug decrim, like that passed in Oregon,</p>
<p>so that any drug is now, it&rsquo;s not legal,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really fully set up clinics to offer it to people</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s no legal supply like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s decriminalized.</p>
<p>So my sense of things is based a lot on watching</p>
<p>what happened with medical marijuana</p>
<p>and marijuana legalization.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sitting here in Massachusetts</p>
<p>where marijuana is legal,</p>
<p>but what happened first was medical marijuana.</p>
<p>So what we see is that medicalization,</p>
<p>by demonstrating that under certain contexts,</p>
<p>the risks are much less than the benefits,</p>
<p>and then there are benefits,</p>
<p>and then people hear stories about people</p>
<p>that have gotten better,</p>
<p>and then that changes their minds,</p>
<p>and then eventually that builds up to why are we throwing</p>
<p>people in jail for this?</p>
<p>Just the culture, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that what we&rsquo;re gonna have 2023</p>
<p>is MDMA approved by the FDA, chances are.</p>
<p>Psilocybin will be a year or two after that.</p>
<p>Then what we&rsquo;re gonna need is a decade</p>
<p>of psychedelic clinics that are gonna roll out</p>
<p>across America, also other countries as well,</p>
<p>thousands of these psychedelic clinics.</p>
<p>We already have hundreds of ketamine clinics</p>
<p>that are ketamine for depression.</p>
<p>More and more people are realizing that ketamine,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s used with therapy, it&rsquo;s better than when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But the therapists wanna be psychedelic therapists.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna be a ketamine therapist or an MDMA therapist.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll be cross trained.</p>
<p>So we will have a decade of these thousands</p>
<p>of psychedelic clinics and all these stories</p>
<p>of people getting better.</p>
<p>And 2035 is when I think that we will move</p>
<p>to licensed legalization, which is when you will</p>
<p>have the option of just going somewhere</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve done this educational stuff.</p>
<p>Potentially, I also think it would be better</p>
<p>to have the opportunity for people to go for free,</p>
<p>paid for by tax money, to these clinics,</p>
<p>and you have your first experience</p>
<p>with psychedelics under supervision.</p>
<p>And you know what you&rsquo;re getting into.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, you know, to ask the questionnaire,</p>
<p>what the risks are with the drugs,</p>
<p>then you get your license.</p>
<p>So 2035 is when I think that&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>And the clinics will be sites of these initiations.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;d be a safe environment, just like you said,</p>
<p>all the things that are actually maximize the likelihood</p>
<p>of a pleasant experience and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It is a frustratingly slow process.</p>
<p>And the FDA being part of that process is very frustrating.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s benefits,</p>
<p>but boy, I wish it could move a lot faster.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from being a parent is that when you have little kids,</p>
<p>it seems like they&rsquo;ll be with you forever.</p>
<p>But then when they grow up and they go to college</p>
<p>and they leave, do you look back and like,</p>
<p>where did that 20 years go?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, so we&rsquo;re still dealing with the legacy</p>
<p>of the civil war and slavery in America.</p>
<p>So actually a 20 year plan is not that long.</p>
<p>So while we say it&rsquo;s frustratingly slow, and it is,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s 50 years since the psychedelic sixties.</p>
<p>And right now it&rsquo;s 36 years since MDMA was criminalized.</p>
<p>And you think about all those people that committed suicide</p>
<p>from PTSD or from anything else.</p>
<p>And all those people that could have been helped</p>
<p>if the DEA had accepted the Administrative Law Judge</p>
<p>recommendation that MDMA stay in schedule three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tremendously sad.</p>
<p>At the same time, culture evolves slowly.</p>
<p>You know, you read the Bible or you read all this stuff,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not that different from people thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>So how are we gonna really evolve enough</p>
<p>over the next couple of decades</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t destroy the planet and don&rsquo;t kill each other?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think psychedelics have an important role</p>
<p>to play, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve devoted my life to psychedelics.</p>
<p>And it is frustratingly slow.</p>
<p>And what I said to myself is our whole effort</p>
<p>has not been fast enough.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about PTSD and MDMA?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this fascinating paper came out</p>
<p>on a fascinating study that you&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a phase three study.</p>
<p>Can you describe what the study is?</p>
<p>Can you describe what phase three means?</p>
<p>Can you describe what the findings are</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s in fact so important and impactful?</p>
<p>Yeah, this study came out May 10th in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>So one of the highest impact factors in medicine,</p>
<p>journals, it was tremendous.</p>
<p>So to make a drug into a medicine,</p>
<p>the first thing you need to do is what are called</p>
<p>nonclinical or preclinical studies,</p>
<p>meaning safety established in animals.</p>
<p>What does the drug do?</p>
<p>What are the side effects in animals?</p>
<p>Where do you see the risks?</p>
<p>And then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies.</p>
<p>And phase one studies are where you move</p>
<p>from animals to humans.</p>
<p>And those are more safety studies</p>
<p>and trying to describe what the drug does</p>
<p>so that you can determine</p>
<p>if there is potential medical value there.</p>
<p>Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have phase one studies in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like phase one slash two,</p>
<p>where you bring in the patients,</p>
<p>but you still are doing sort of dose response</p>
<p>safety studies, but you use patients.</p>
<p>But most phase one studies are healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Phase two are where you start bringing in the patients</p>
<p>and you start experimenting with various different things.</p>
<p>The purpose of phase two is really just to design phase three.</p>
<p>Now, again, I&rsquo;m sort of putting out of the picture</p>
<p>in another area is mechanism of action.</p>
<p>How do these drugs work?</p>
<p>Phase two, you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what they do,</p>
<p>who your patient population is, what are the risks,</p>
<p>who do you include, who do you exclude,</p>
<p>what are the doses, what is your treatment,</p>
<p>what are your measures.</p>
<p>In our case, it was how do you do a double blind study?</p>
<p>That was a big part of phase two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big challenge for psychedelic drugs.</p>
<p>Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect,</p>
<p>how do you do a double blind study?</p>
<p>The double blind, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>would mean that the patient should not be aware</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a placebo or not.</p>
<p>And the researcher.</p>
<p>And the researcher is not aware.</p>
<p>And so for that lack of awareness,</p>
<p>when the effect is really strong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to do on both the researcher</p>
<p>and the patient side.</p>
<p>Yes, and sometimes they talk about triple blind.</p>
<p>So the other part is the raters</p>
<p>that evaluate the symptoms and before and after.</p>
<p>So you ideally want triple blind.</p>
<p>You want the patients, the researchers,</p>
<p>and the evaluators of the outcomes, all of them,</p>
<p>not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to reduce experiment or bias.</p>
<p>And then you move to phase three,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve figured out how to design the phase three studies.</p>
<p>And phase three are the large scale multiple studies</p>
<p>multi site, placebo controlled, double blind studies,</p>
<p>where you must prove safety and efficacy</p>
<p>in order to get permission to market the drug.</p>
<p>Now, for us, when we started MAPS in 86,</p>
<p>as I said, it was one year after the criminalization</p>
<p>of MDMA in 85, we had five different protocols</p>
<p>that were rejected by the FDA for studying with MDMA.</p>
<p>And these were all various phase one studies.</p>
<p>They came from Harvard, from UC San Francisco,</p>
<p>from the University in Arizona,</p>
<p>and Albuquerque, New Mexico, all over.</p>
<p>And they were all rejected.</p>
<p>1992, six years after we started,</p>
<p>we got the first permission for phase one.</p>
<p>And that took us through much of the 90s.</p>
<p>Again, things are slow because we have to raise the money</p>
<p>through donations.</p>
<p>And then in 1999 is when we started the work with PTSD.</p>
<p>And that then took us till November 29th, 2016,</p>
<p>which is when we had the end of phase two meeting with FDA.</p>
<p>So it took 30 years from the start of MAPS</p>
<p>to the end of phase two meeting with FDA.</p>
<p>And what we had discovered during phase two</p>
<p>was several different key points.</p>
<p>The drugs that are available right now for PTSD,</p>
<p>the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil,</p>
<p>that have been approved by FDA and regulators in Europe</p>
<p>as well, the European Medicines Agency, for PTSD,</p>
<p>they work better in women than in men,</p>
<p>and they failed in combat related PTSD.</p>
<p>All right, so what we learned is that MDMA assisted therapy</p>
<p>works just as well in men or women,</p>
<p>and it works in combat related PTSD.</p>
<p>It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD.</p>
<p>We also discovered that even though there are stories</p>
<p>that people take MDMA at raves and they dance all night</p>
<p>and they overheat and they get hypothermia</p>
<p>and they die from overheating, which is true</p>
<p>and can happen from pure MDMA,</p>
<p>or that sometimes people have heard about</p>
<p>needing to cool down and so they drink water</p>
<p>and then while they&rsquo;re dancing all night</p>
<p>and then they drink too much water</p>
<p>and then they dilute their blood</p>
<p>and they die from hyponatremia.</p>
<p>So there are risks of MDMA, but we discovered</p>
<p>that in a therapeutic setting,</p>
<p>we can control all those risks,</p>
<p>those things don&rsquo;t happen at all.</p>
<p>So we discovered safety, we could demonstrate safety.</p>
<p>We also figured out that our measure, the CAPS,</p>
<p>the Clinician Administrative PTSD Scale,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the gold standard all over the world</p>
<p>for measuring PTSD symptoms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what the FDA and the EMA require.</p>
<p>We discovered that it was a good measure for us</p>
<p>and that we could show changes in that.</p>
<p>The other big thing that we learned is that,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t mentioned this yet,</p>
<p>but the work in the 50s and 60s with LSD and psilocybin</p>
<p>and the modern research over the last 20 years</p>
<p>with psilocybin and classic psychedelics</p>
<p>has demonstrated that there&rsquo;s a link</p>
<p>between this mystical experience,</p>
<p>this unit of mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes</p>
<p>for the treatment of addiction,</p>
<p>for working with people with life threatening illnesses</p>
<p>that for OCD, for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>both in the 50 years ago and then the research now</p>
<p>has been that there&rsquo;s a link between the depth</p>
<p>of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcome.</p>
<p>What we discovered is that that&rsquo;s not the case for MDMA,</p>
<p>that people do score fairly high</p>
<p>on the scales of mystical experience,</p>
<p>not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>but they do score pretty high on average.</p>
<p>And a significant number of them have over the cutoff</p>
<p>for what would be considered a full mystical experience.</p>
<p>So enough to say that we could look at a correlation</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t find any.</p>
<p>The other thing that we discovered,</p>
<p>and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally,</p>
<p>is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School,</p>
<p>a big part of it was on the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the regulation of the medical use</p>
<p>of psychedelics in marijuana.</p>
<p>A big part of my dissertation was how to do</p>
<p>the double blind study.</p>
<p>And I thought I&rsquo;d solve the problem</p>
<p>and I persuaded my dissertation committee</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d solve the problem.</p>
<p>And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA</p>
<p>versus therapy with full dose MDMA.</p>
<p>And everybody knows that they&rsquo;re gonna get MDMA,</p>
<p>most of these people have never done it before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be confused about is it full dose or low dose.</p>
<p>And then the challenge is to pick a dose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s high enough so that there is this confusion,</p>
<p>but not so high that it&rsquo;s so therapeutic</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t tell the difference between the groups.</p>
<p>So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo,</p>
<p>25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams,</p>
<p>50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams,</p>
<p>125 and 150.</p>
<p>What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong</p>
<p>and that there is no good solution</p>
<p>to the double blind problem.</p>
<p>What we found is that, to our surprise actually,</p>
<p>was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I mean, the normal dose is like,</p>
<p>full dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that.</p>
<p>But 75 milligrams was an effective dose.</p>
<p>And we discovered that the lower doses,</p>
<p>so I was half right, you could say,</p>
<p>the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50,</p>
<p>they could produce enough confusion</p>
<p>that you could say that they were successful at blinding,</p>
<p>not perfectly, but enough confusion</p>
<p>so that people, therapists, couldn&rsquo;t know for sure</p>
<p>so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say.</p>
<p>But what we discovered, again, to our surprise,</p>
<p>was that the low doses made people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>They stimulated them, but they didn&rsquo;t reduce the fear.</p>
<p>And so people still got better</p>
<p>with the therapy with low dose MDMA.</p>
<p>But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo,</p>
<p>they did even better</p>
<p>than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA.</p>
<p>So we call it an anti therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that they got worse,</p>
<p>but it made people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But we would still help them make some progress.</p>
<p>So we had the blinding,</p>
<p>but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy</p>
<p>with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier</p>
<p>for us to find a difference between the two groups.</p>
<p>And so the real question is,</p>
<p>if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?</p>
<p>So we went to the FDA,</p>
<p>and so this was what we discovered during phase two.</p>
<p>We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting,</p>
<p>and we said, we can give you blinding,</p>
<p>but it will make it easier for us</p>
<p>to find a difference between the two groups.</p>
<p>And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo</p>
<p>versus therapy with full dose MDMA.</p>
<p>That will cause a problem</p>
<p>because most people will be able to tell what they&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>What Tom Loughran, a doctor</p>
<p>who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA</p>
<p>is our main advisor.</p>
<p>So the first thing he said</p>
<p>is that the double blind fails in practice a lot,</p>
<p>even with SSRIs,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s certain side effects</p>
<p>that you have with these drugs.</p>
<p>And the doctors who are doing these research</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re reporting your side effects,</p>
<p>they can say, oh, that&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>you got the active drug instead of the placebo.</p>
<p>So the double blind is in theory is terrific,</p>
<p>but in practice, it doesn&rsquo;t always work quite as well.</p>
<p>And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches</p>
<p>that they think are important to reduce bias.</p>
<p>The first one is easy to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called random assignment.</p>
<p>So sometimes there are studies</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll treat a bunch of people with something</p>
<p>and some fraction of them will get better and some won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then you say, okay, all those who didn&rsquo;t get better,</p>
<p>who volunteers to get this new treatment?</p>
<p>And then you give them the new treatment,</p>
<p>but the people that volunteer</p>
<p>are more likely to wanna get better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not representative sample of everybody that has.</p>
<p>So when you have random assignment,</p>
<p>everybody is similarly motivated</p>
<p>and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we told,</p>
<p>of course we need random assignment.</p>
<p>The other part was when the bias double blind</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work as well,</p>
<p>then the system of independent raters</p>
<p>is especially important of how you do that.</p>
<p>So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them,</p>
<p>and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests</p>
<p>to make sure that they evaluate this,</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re given a videotape of a PTSD patient</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re supposed to rate them</p>
<p>according to their symptoms.</p>
<p>And then we sort of make sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got this calibrated rater pool</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all done by Zoom, by telemedicine,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re randomly assigned to the next person</p>
<p>that needs a rating.</p>
<p>So they said 20 raters.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got like 20 raters</p>
<p>and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater</p>
<p>sees each patient only once, maybe twice,</p>
<p>but not tracking them through the study.</p>
<p>So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t know where this person is in the study.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a fellow, Bob Temple,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like the old wise man at the FDA.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been there since 1972.</p>
<p>He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy</p>
<p>and they brought him into the final meeting of this process</p>
<p>where we are trying to design phase three.</p>
<p>So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three,</p>
<p>that was November 29th, 2016,</p>
<p>we then negotiated for eight months</p>
<p>on the design of phase three</p>
<p>and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need.</p>
<p>This process of design.</p>
<p>To the extent that I have any artistic creativity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in protocol design.</p>
<p>I really love that.</p>
<p>So you enjoy this process.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it because it&rsquo;s always trade offs</p>
<p>and I acknowledge that we are all biased.</p>
<p>And so how do you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something beautiful about the scientific process</p>
<p>designed to get you to the truth.</p>
<p>Especially when that scientific process</p>
<p>is trying to get to the truth of the human organism,</p>
<p>which is so complicated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult to dissect,</p>
<p>to get the strong effects.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re analyzing,</p>
<p>when you have like raters, they&rsquo;re watching a video.</p>
<p>Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging.</p>
<p>Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p>And so we came to this agreement with FDA though</p>
<p>that we would use this independent rater pool.</p>
<p>And so we learned in phase two again,</p>
<p>that the double blind,</p>
<p>there was no solution to the double blind problem.</p>
<p>And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency</p>
<p>in the end agreed that the best design</p>
<p>was therapy with inactive placebo</p>
<p>versus therapy with full dose MDMA,</p>
<p>accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell</p>
<p>whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA.</p>
<p>Most therapists will be able to tell the difference,</p>
<p>but that makes a harder test for us</p>
<p>to show a difference between the two groups</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re giving them inactive placebo</p>
<p>and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA.</p>
<p>So once we started phase three,</p>
<p>so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three.</p>
<p>And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out</p>
<p>was the results of our first phase three study.</p>
<p>We came to agreement with FDA</p>
<p>that we would do two phase three studies,</p>
<p>each would have 100 persons in them.</p>
<p>And what the FDA said to us is that they thought</p>
<p>that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers</p>
<p>than they wanted to see for safety.</p>
<p>The reason they said that is it in phase two,</p>
<p>we had a large effect size.</p>
<p>So from a statistical point of view,</p>
<p>the bigger of an effect that you&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>the fewer number of people you need</p>
<p>to get statistical significance.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to find small differences,</p>
<p>you need large numbers of people</p>
<p>to sort of work out the noise.</p>
<p>So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies.</p>
<p>And the idea is that it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that the first study would show the efficacy</p>
<p>because the effect is so strong.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well.</p>
<p>So one of the things we also realized</p>
<p>when you work with a highly stigmatized drug</p>
<p>in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition</p>
<p>that we need highly sympathetic subjects</p>
<p>and we need to make the best case we can,</p>
<p>which means we need to work with the hardest cases</p>
<p>so that this is really needed.</p>
<p>And so we end up enrolling people.</p>
<p>The first study was chronic severe PTSD.</p>
<p>And unlike many studies of PTSD,</p>
<p>we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So we have multiple people</p>
<p>that have tried to kill themselves</p>
<p>that we felt like if we were to exclude them,</p>
<p>what are we doing?</p>
<p>Those are the people that need it the most.</p>
<p>So we came to this agreement with FDA.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients,</p>
<p>including those that had attempted suicide.</p>
<p>And we would do these two 100 person studies.</p>
<p>And we also negotiated what&rsquo;s called an interim analysis.</p>
<p>So what that means is that</p>
<p>when the study is underway,</p>
<p>and often big, big studies,</p>
<p>they have this kind of interim analysis</p>
<p>where what you do is,</p>
<p>and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people</p>
<p>had reached the primary outcome measure</p>
<p>and all 100 had been enrolled,</p>
<p>then we would take a look at the data.</p>
<p>And if the statistical analysis that we did</p>
<p>was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose</p>
<p>based on what we saw in phase two,</p>
<p>the interim analysis</p>
<p>is for what&rsquo;s called sample size reestimation.</p>
<p>So what it means is if the results aren&rsquo;t as good</p>
<p>as you thought they would, you can add more people.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get statistical significance.</p>
<p>It means that your effect isn&rsquo;t as strong as you thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be harder to get insurance to cover it,</p>
<p>but FDA will still approve it</p>
<p>because FDA also believes that these are group averages.</p>
<p>There may be some people that will later figure out</p>
<p>respond better than others.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll approve it if it&rsquo;s statistically significant,</p>
<p>even if it has a low effect size.</p>
<p>The SSRIs have low effect size.</p>
<p>So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020.</p>
<p>And what we discovered to our delight</p>
<p>was that we did not need to add any subjects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we were told.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t told like, what is the results?</p>
<p>We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero,</p>
<p>or you need to add X numbers of people to the study</p>
<p>to get statistical significance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right around the time that COVID hit</p>
<p>and lockdowns happened.</p>
<p>And we ended up negotiating with FDA</p>
<p>that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100.</p>
<p>It took a while for us to end up doing that.</p>
<p>So the paper that we just published</p>
<p>is on the results of 90 people.</p>
<p>I think it was 46 in the MDMA group,</p>
<p>44 in the placebo group.</p>
<p>And what we discovered was that the study worked better</p>
<p>than we had even hoped.</p>
<p>So the first thing is that</p>
<p>you look at statistical significance.</p>
<p>You have to get 0.05,</p>
<p>which basically means a nickel out of a dollar,</p>
<p>a one in 20 chance that the difference</p>
<p>between the two groups is due to some random factor</p>
<p>rather than to your intervention.</p>
<p>And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy</p>
<p>and then with inactive placebo</p>
<p>and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo.</p>
<p>So you have to get 0.05.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another measure</p>
<p>that the FDA uses sometimes called robust,</p>
<p>which means one in a thousand,</p>
<p>instead of one in 20, one in a thousand.</p>
<p>And if you get a robust results, 0.001,</p>
<p>and you meet some other criteria,</p>
<p>they might agree to approve the drug</p>
<p>on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two.</p>
<p>Because when you think about it,</p>
<p>a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study,</p>
<p>a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study,</p>
<p>you multiply that together, it&rsquo;s one in 400, 0.025.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>So robust 0.001 is even better</p>
<p>than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05.</p>
<p>What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001.</p>
<p>Outrageous, incredibly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a measure of both the difference</p>
<p>between the two groups and the variability.</p>
<p>And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability,</p>
<p>that most people who got the MDA</p>
<p>got quite a large amount of benefit from it.</p>
<p>And most people who got the placebo</p>
<p>were more or less in the same range as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>from a perspective of approval by the FDA.</p>
<p>Maybe perhaps that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re seeing it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also exciting because it has a chance</p>
<p>to help people that are truly suffering, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, if we can get one in 10,000</p>
<p>in the first phase three study,</p>
<p>chances are we can get one in 20 in the second.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really gonna be about safety for us</p>
<p>in the second phase three study.</p>
<p>Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance,</p>
<p>but you could have an effect that&rsquo;s not very significant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clinically significant.</p>
<p>You can have statistical significance</p>
<p>without clinical significance.</p>
<p>And as I said, the more people you get in the study,</p>
<p>you can find smaller and smaller differences</p>
<p>between two groups.</p>
<p>Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size.</p>
<p>So effect size is based on&hellip;</p>
<p>That scale you mentioned?</p>
<p>Well, the scale of the effect size</p>
<p>is based on standard deviations.</p>
<p>So an effect size of one means that your results</p>
<p>are one standard deviation away from the norm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s considered very large.</p>
<p>The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered small effect size.</p>
<p>Medium is starting to be around 0.6</p>
<p>and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes.</p>
<p>We had what&rsquo;s called placebo subtracted effect size.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two different ways to look at it.</p>
<p>Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference</p>
<p>between your two groups.</p>
<p>And what that is for us, since one group had therapy</p>
<p>and one had therapy plus MDMA,</p>
<p>the placebo subtracted effect size</p>
<p>is basically the effect of just the MDMA</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve kind of washed out the therapy.</p>
<p>That was 0.91.</p>
<p>So we had a large effect size, which was different.</p>
<p>Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo.</p>
<p>Yeah. Wow.</p>
<p>Now, when we do the within group,</p>
<p>meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy,</p>
<p>look at their baseline and their outcomes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way to look at it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna actually happen in practice</p>
<p>because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 2.1 effect size.</p>
<p>Two standard deviations away from the norm</p>
<p>is enormous effect size.</p>
<p>The other part is that we had no effect by site,</p>
<p>which is very important.</p>
<p>So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada,</p>
<p>11 throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?</p>
<p>Because what that might mean is</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ve got all your patients</p>
<p>or most of your patients going to this one site,</p>
<p>which is these highly experienced therapists</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like hippies from way back</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re super experienced with psychedelics</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting great results,</p>
<p>but nobody else gets good results.</p>
<p>So we had no effect by site.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ve been able to train all these new therapists.</p>
<p>We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites.</p>
<p>We also discovered that there&rsquo;s a group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered to be very difficult to treat,</p>
<p>which is called the dissociative subtype.</p>
<p>So when people are traumatized,</p>
<p>one of the ways to psychologically survive that</p>
<p>is you dissociate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>When you do that though, it&rsquo;s hard to come back</p>
<p>because when you come back,</p>
<p>then you get all these painful memories and fearful.</p>
<p>And so the extreme of that</p>
<p>is called dissociative identity disorder,</p>
<p>kind of like schizophrenia, almost dissociative identity.</p>
<p>So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype</p>
<p>and those are considered to be the hardest to treat</p>
<p>because the theory is that you need to be ego intact.</p>
<p>As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated</p>
<p>with therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p>And you need to be talking about what traumatized you</p>
<p>and working through that and expressing it,</p>
<p>letting it out, not keeping it in.</p>
<p>So the dissociative subtype seems like it&rsquo;s harder</p>
<p>for them to get back into the event</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so dissociated.</p>
<p>What we showed is that those people did even better</p>
<p>on average than everybody else.</p>
<p>So that MDMA is integrative.</p>
<p>It helps people who are so separate</p>
<p>that they make even more rapid progress.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like the MDMA made it more difficult</p>
<p>for them to dissociate.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, or you could say it made it easier</p>
<p>for them to remember.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>To reverse the dissociation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma</p>
<p>so that you can have these unconscious memories</p>
<p>or memories that you cannot remember</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;ve suppressed so much,</p>
<p>but they distort your view.</p>
<p>Your filter of the world is distorted</p>
<p>by these fearful memories that the world can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about to happen.</p>
<p>So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma,</p>
<p>but by reducing the fear,</p>
<p>then the memories can come to the surface.</p>
<p>Then you can process them, let out the emotions,</p>
<p>cry, scream, shake, whatever.</p>
<p>And then through this MDMA effect</p>
<p>on the amygdala and the hippocampus,</p>
<p>it helps you store these memories into longterm storage</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not always about to happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the past.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re part of your story, but they&rsquo;re not the whole story.</p>
<p>So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better.</p>
<p>Now, none of this would be enough unless safety.</p>
<p>So from a safety perspective,</p>
<p>what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study</p>
<p>that attempted to kill herself twice during the study.</p>
<p>There was another woman that was so worried</p>
<p>that she might kill herself,</p>
<p>that the therapy brought these things to the surface</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s been pushing away,</p>
<p>that she checked herself into a hospital</p>
<p>in order to avoid self harm.</p>
<p>At the end of the study,</p>
<p>what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have anybody in the MDMA group</p>
<p>attempt to kill themselves.</p>
<p>So the MDMA is really helpful</p>
<p>for giving people a sense of hope</p>
<p>and that they can somehow process this.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our big concern in the second phase three study.</p>
<p>As I said, it&rsquo;s more gonna be about safety</p>
<p>than about efficacy.</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;ll get the efficacy,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re very concerned about safety.</p>
<p>Because we had problems in the first phase three study</p>
<p>of somebody trying to kill herself twice</p>
<p>in the placebo group,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the background for having PTSD.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;d have to be a disproportionate number of people</p>
<p>in the MDMA group try to kill themselves</p>
<p>or succeed in killing themselves</p>
<p>than in the placebo group for the FDA to say,</p>
<p>oh, this MDMA, it&rsquo;s too dangerous.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So the other findings from safety</p>
<p>is that the side effects are transitory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re minor, they&rsquo;re sweating or jaw clenching</p>
<p>or a slight temperature increase.</p>
<p>And everybody that&rsquo;s been to a rave knows about it.</p>
<p>Take an ecstasy, there are some side effects.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re minor, they&rsquo;re transitory</p>
<p>and there has been this massive problem</p>
<p>of during the eighties, the nineties,</p>
<p>NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse</p>
<p>was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic</p>
<p>and that you take it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be major brain damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be significant functional consequences.</p>
<p>And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous.</p>
<p>It should never even be researched.</p>
<p>Nobody should even get it once</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s poison and brain damage.</p>
<p>Well, we no longer believe that, that was exaggerated.</p>
<p>That was in service of the drug war.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve done in phase two neurocognitive tests</p>
<p>before and after in two of our different sites</p>
<p>and showed no decline in cognitive functioning.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any neurotoxicity happening</p>
<p>and the doses that we use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no obvious functional consequences.</p>
<p>People are getting better.</p>
<p>And the other thing that we&rsquo;ve learned in phase two</p>
<p>and that we still have to learn from this study.</p>
<p>So what we showed is the durability of the effect.</p>
<p>We showed that 32% of the people</p>
<p>that got the therapy without MDMA</p>
<p>at two months after the last experimental session</p>
<p>no longer had PTSD.</p>
<p>Just with the therapy, which is phenomenal</p>
<p>because these are on average 14 years PTSD,</p>
<p>one third had PTSD over 20 years.</p>
<p>And just with the therapy,</p>
<p>32% no longer had PTSD at the two months.</p>
<p>However, those people that got MDMA, it was 67%.</p>
<p>No longer had PTSD, more than twice as good.</p>
<p>In phase two and in phase three,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also gonna do the 12 month followup.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not for the FDA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not for approvability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more for insurance companies</p>
<p>because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time.</p>
<p>If it fades, if it&rsquo;s great results initially</p>
<p>but then it fades after six months, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>And what we showed in phase two</p>
<p>is that people keep getting better.</p>
<p>At the two month followup, they&rsquo;re doing pretty well</p>
<p>but at the 12 month followup, they&rsquo;re even better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s durable.</p>
<p>People have learned how to process trauma.</p>
<p>They keep getting better.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve not reached that point in this phase three study</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s got their one year followup.</p>
<p>But we have also done three and a half year followups</p>
<p>to some of the groups that were in phase two</p>
<p>and showed that it was durable.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing a long term followup now</p>
<p>to many of the people in phase two,</p>
<p>some of them treated 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all more for the insurance companies.</p>
<p>So basically what we found in the paper</p>
<p>that we just published is that it was highly efficacious,</p>
<p>highly significant, no effect by sight,</p>
<p>works in the hardest cases and the safety record was great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible success.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really exciting, especially given</p>
<p>that the people who&rsquo;ve committed, who attempted</p>
<p>to commit suicide were let into the study.</p>
<p>And so these are people who are truly suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>And I mean, just to speak to the frustration</p>
<p>why things can&rsquo;t move faster,</p>
<p>but for what it is, it&rsquo;s incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Is there other studies of this nature</p>
<p>that you foresee enabling that same kind</p>
<p>of positive impact, whether it&rsquo;s MDMA</p>
<p>for other things like treating addiction,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s psilocybin for other conditions?</p>
<p>Is there something else that&rsquo;s promising?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that what we&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think is unique to MDMA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s MDMA assisted psychotherapy.</p>
<p>MDMA is ideal for PTSD.</p>
<p>Maybe it won&rsquo;t work as well for OCD or other things.</p>
<p>It was very strategic why we chose MDMA</p>
<p>and why we chose PTSD.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that the results that we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>are so unique to MDMA assisted therapy.</p>
<p>I think that psilocybin assisted therapy</p>
<p>is gonna be great for people</p>
<p>with life threatening illnesses,</p>
<p>cancer who are anxious about dying.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>in the treatment of addiction.</p>
<p>Again, these are in combination</p>
<p>with sort of the psilocybin tobacco</p>
<p>is cognitive behavioral therapy with psilocybin.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit more difficult,</p>
<p>psilocybin for depression.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll be quite as good.</p>
<p>There are some biological aspects sometimes to depression,</p>
<p>but I think that there&rsquo;ll be really good results</p>
<p>for psilocybin for depression.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be approved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s considered a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.</p>
<p>Ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate addiction,</p>
<p>helping people go through withdrawal</p>
<p>and then giving them this chance</p>
<p>to deal with the material that drives them for addiction.</p>
<p>There was Ben Sessa, Dr. Ben Sessa in England</p>
<p>did MDMA for alcohol use disorder.</p>
<p>And that was really great, the results he got.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the case that he ended up</p>
<p>basically treating people for trauma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trauma that people run,</p>
<p>the emotional challenges that people run from</p>
<p>into quieting that pain through drug addiction or alcoholism.</p>
<p>So trauma is behind a lot of addiction.</p>
<p>I think that we are going to see a revolution in psychiatry</p>
<p>and that there will be a lot of conditions</p>
<p>that have left a lot of people still suffering</p>
<p>that psychedelic assisted therapy,</p>
<p>different psychedelics, different approaches.</p>
<p>But I think that we will see a lot of hope</p>
<p>for psychiatry and psychotherapy</p>
<p>and that psychedelics would be a big part</p>
<p>of changing the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is really to me fascinating.</p>
<p>So I actually, when I was younger,</p>
<p>for the longest time, wanted to be a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>So I was excited by psychotherapy,</p>
<p>but then I perhaps incorrectly, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but became more and more cynical</p>
<p>because it felt like it was more about prescribing drugs</p>
<p>than psychotherapy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to correct you.</p>
<p>I mean, right now, there is a crisis in psychiatry</p>
<p>that there are so many psychiatrists that are so fed up</p>
<p>because they have been pharmaceuticalized.</p>
<p>They meet people for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>they adjust their medications.</p>
<p>This is the way they make the most money,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve lost the art of talking to people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we see that so many young psychiatric</p>
<p>residents are so thrilled by psychedelics</p>
<p>that they really want to get back to treating people</p>
<p>as individuals, not just a bunch of chemicals.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s truly fascinating.</p>
<p>Because the reason it was appealing to me,</p>
<p>it was a way to study the human mind</p>
<p>and to see ways through talking</p>
<p>that you can make people feel better,</p>
<p>make people better, make people suffer less.</p>
<p>And that was really exciting at the time.</p>
<p>I ended up then going to AI because then</p>
<p>I can understand the mind from that angle.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s exciting that that could be also</p>
<p>revolutionized the field of psychotherapy,</p>
<p>take it from its back to its origins,</p>
<p>to where a psychiatrist would be a scholar of the mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Freud talked about dreams</p>
<p>as the railroad to the unconscious.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of,</p>
<p>you really spent a lot of time with people.</p>
<p>Now, right before he died, in his last book,</p>
<p>Freud wrote something, and again,</p>
<p>this will be a rough paraphrase,</p>
<p>but he said that in the future,</p>
<p>we may learn about the energies of the brain</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be ways with chemicals to influence that</p>
<p>that will help the therapeutic process.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you could say he was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This study paints a fascinating picture of a future</p>
<p>where first for medical applications,</p>
<p>but then also in general, psychedelics of various forms</p>
<p>could be used by the broader society.</p>
<p>Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but if much of society, including our politicians,</p>
<p>are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego</p>
<p>and going through this whole process,</p>
<p>how do you think the world may look different</p>
<p>in 20, 30, 50 years?</p>
<p>Ah, okay, so I said that I think</p>
<p>licensed legalization happens in 2035.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think by 2050, we will have enough people,</p>
<p>hopefully, spiritualized.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also talking about,</p>
<p>we hear so much in terms of climate change</p>
<p>about net zero carbon.</p>
<p>So our goal is net zero trauma.</p>
<p>When do we have a world with net zero trauma?</p>
<p>I mean, right now, we have two sites in Israel.</p>
<p>So we help a few people,</p>
<p>but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized</p>
<p>millions of people on both sides.</p>
<p>So we are a long way away from net zero trauma.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the hope, and that&rsquo;s, I think, possible.</p>
<p>I think humanity as a whole</p>
<p>is like lemmings heading over a cliff</p>
<p>with climate change and with the nuclear proliferation</p>
<p>and just the religious hatreds</p>
<p>and the more the retreat to authoritarianism</p>
<p>and fundamentalism and tribalism.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a very good chance, though,</p>
<p>that psychedelics used wisely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just make psychedelics legal</p>
<p>and everybody takes them,</p>
<p>as you talked about Ted Kaczynski.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the context that people take it in.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s a reasonable chance</p>
<p>that enough people can,</p>
<p>sort of, you could say, clean their filters</p>
<p>to see people as more similar to them than different,</p>
<p>not to label them as the enemy.</p>
<p>Stan Groff, again, had this beautiful phrase</p>
<p>about transparent to the transcendent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, so for our ego,</p>
<p>can we be transparent to the transcendent?</p>
<p>Can the filter that we look through the world at</p>
<p>be cleaned to, you could say,</p>
<p>cleansing the doors of perception?</p>
<p>Can it be cleaned to the point where we can see</p>
<p>the humanity in everybody and see that,</p>
<p>one way to say this is that,</p>
<p>can we get to the point where religions</p>
<p>are seen as like languages?</p>
<p>Where we all have this need to communicate,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thousands of different languages,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t say that this language</p>
<p>is fundamentally better than this language,</p>
<p>this language is the only right language,</p>
<p>everybody must speak English</p>
<p>and Russian is bad or German is better.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get to that point that religions are like that,</p>
<p>that there are different cultural backgrounds,</p>
<p>different symbol systems,</p>
<p>different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this,</p>
<p>but that, yeah, Jesus is the son of God,</p>
<p>but so is everybody.</p>
<p>Or the Jews are the chosen people, but so is everybody.</p>
<p>So can we get there?</p>
<p>I think that we can.</p>
<p>And I think that we need to,</p>
<p>to survive the challenges that we&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics</p>
<p>as tools forward and trying to bring the context around them</p>
<p>to be one of responsibility</p>
<p>rather than just profit maximization</p>
<p>and just get as many people to do them</p>
<p>from all these for profit companies,</p>
<p>can we, and then also drug policy reform</p>
<p>and embed knowledge in the society,</p>
<p>can we get to honest drug education?</p>
<p>DARE, the Drug Awareness Resistance Education,</p>
<p>is fundamentally twisted.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the program that&rsquo;s used in a lot of schools now.</p>
<p>So can we get honest drug education,</p>
<p>pure drugs, harm reduction,</p>
<p>and knowledge about therapeutic uses</p>
<p>and on the one hand,</p>
<p>and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful and that&rsquo;s our goal.</p>
<p>But in this landscape of pharma companies,</p>
<p>they make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Some people are worried about the impact</p>
<p>of those, you know, of big pharma</p>
<p>on the landscape of human trauma.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, of course, some companies could do good,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not inherent,</p>
<p>like many of these companies are not optimizing for good,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re optimizing for profit.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Does this rise of for profit pharma companies worry you?</p>
<p>How do you navigate it?</p>
<p>Do we still have for profit companies</p>
<p>that basically do what MAPS does,</p>
<p>which is like fight the good fight</p>
<p>for the benefit of humanity?</p>
<p>Like how do we proceed in this,</p>
<p>in landscape where drugs can make a lot of money?</p>
<p>Well, I am concerned.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the rise of the for profit companies,</p>
<p>we have to realize is a sign of success,</p>
<p>that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve overcome a lot of the public attitudes</p>
<p>that are against it, we&rsquo;ve demonstrated some success.</p>
<p>So the rise of the for profit companies</p>
<p>are a sign of the progress that we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>On the other hand, turning things over</p>
<p>to profit maximizing companies,</p>
<p>the big concern is that they&rsquo;re gonna try</p>
<p>to minimize the amount of therapy</p>
<p>and make it so the cost is less,</p>
<p>so insurance companies are more likely to cover it</p>
<p>and then that they just sell the most drugs.</p>
<p>The other thing we&rsquo;ve seen as an example of this</p>
<p>is S ketamine by Johnson and Johnson for depression.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s done by a profit maximizing company.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy</p>
<p>or psychotherapy at all.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve gotten approval for S ketamine</p>
<p>on the basis of it&rsquo;s just a pharmacological treatment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not delivered with therapy,</p>
<p>the results fade pretty quickly,</p>
<p>so you need to get more ketamine.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s designed in a way to maximize the profits</p>
<p>for the pharmaceutical company,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t maximize patient outcomes.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing though in these various clinics</p>
<p>that are being set up is that a lot of people are realizing</p>
<p>that it works better with therapy.</p>
<p>And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists</p>
<p>so that when they provide therapy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making more money and then you need less ketamine.</p>
<p>Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been patented for depression</p>
<p>and they sell it for hundreds of dollars,</p>
<p>but ketamine itself</p>
<p>is one of the world&rsquo;s essential medicines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s off patent, it&rsquo;s been around for a long time,</p>
<p>it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only a few bucks because it&rsquo;s generic.</p>
<p>So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying,</p>
<p>great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve helped demonstrate that ketamine is good</p>
<p>for depression, but we&rsquo;re not gonna buy it from you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna buy it for a few bucks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna add therapy to it.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a bunch of ketamine mills you could say</p>
<p>that are just prescribing the ketamine</p>
<p>and people are making a lot of money there.</p>
<p>So I am worried about that.</p>
<p>I think the best thing that we can do</p>
<p>is create an alternative narrative,</p>
<p>a different kind of example.</p>
<p>We can lead by example.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t make for profit companies</p>
<p>into benefit corporations unless they wanna do that.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t make them to really maximize patient outcomes.</p>
<p>But if we create an example of something that&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>the hope is that people will gravitate towards that</p>
<p>and some of the other companies.</p>
<p>Like even now we have Exxon and other these companies,</p>
<p>oil companies saying, oh, we&rsquo;re big</p>
<p>into alternative energy and we&rsquo;re, you know.</p>
<p>And that starts with companies that show an example</p>
<p>that then communicates to the public</p>
<p>that this is something exciting</p>
<p>and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on.</p>
<p>The public demands it and you could say the same thing</p>
<p>for the public demanding the big pharma</p>
<p>to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit</p>
<p>and maybe giving power to the therapists,</p>
<p>more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors</p>
<p>that ultimately want.</p>
<p>I think incentives are interesting,</p>
<p>but I think doctors ultimately care more</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in direct contact with humans.</p>
<p>They want to make people better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you know, sure they wanna make money,</p>
<p>but they ultimately want to make people feel better</p>
<p>because they get to look at people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so joyful to make people feel better</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So giving more power to them is also perhaps</p>
<p>one of the ways that you then incentivize</p>
<p>the pharma companies that are trying to do good</p>
<p>because the doctors will choose those companies.</p>
<p>Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform.</p>
<p>So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA</p>
<p>for 10 or 20 bucks on your own</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve trained people on here&rsquo;s our therapeutic method,</p>
<p>here is our ways for peer support,</p>
<p>then people have an alternative from buying it</p>
<p>from the pharma companies.</p>
<p>So most of the for profit companies</p>
<p>have come to this conclusion</p>
<p>that drug policy reform is bad for their business model.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re making a fundamental mistake.</p>
<p>And I think the reason is that</p>
<p>the more that we de stigmatize this,</p>
<p>the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach,</p>
<p>even when people can get it on their own</p>
<p>and do it with their friends or do it with themselves,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be even more people that say,</p>
<p>oh my God, I&rsquo;ve got real serious issues.</p>
<p>I would rather go to trained professionals</p>
<p>covered by insurance.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;ll increase the business,</p>
<p>but most of the for profit companies don&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>And so as a nonprofit that owns a benefit corp,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not trying to maximize sales or profits.</p>
<p>But I do believe that drug policy reform</p>
<p>creates this alternative access point for people</p>
<p>and that will help keep the for profits in check</p>
<p>to some extent as well.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put on your wise visionary hat</p>
<p>and ask when you look to young folks,</p>
<p>is there advice you can give to young people today,</p>
<p>whether in high school or college about career, about life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived quite a nonlinear</p>
<p>and fascinating life yourself.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give</p>
<p>either on career or more generally on life?</p>
<p>Well, I would say what people often hear is that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not actually here for that long a period of time.</p>
<p>And the world is on fire.</p>
<p>And whether humanity survives is not clear.</p>
<p>And how many species are we gonna kill</p>
<p>before we figure out not to do that anymore?</p>
<p>So I would advise you to really try to</p>
<p>develop a combination of what do you need</p>
<p>in terms of income for your own survival,</p>
<p>but what does the world need in terms of</p>
<p>help to make the world better?</p>
<p>And Howard Thurman, who we talked about,</p>
<p>who ran the Good Friday experiment, the minister there,</p>
<p>he said, he&rsquo;s got a famous quote attributed to him.</p>
<p>He says, and this is exactly it to young people.</p>
<p>He said, there&rsquo;s nothing particular that you should do,</p>
<p>but find what makes you come alive</p>
<p>because what the world needs is people</p>
<p>that have come alive and are passionate.</p>
<p>So I would say that be aware of this trap</p>
<p>that you need vast resources, that you need all this stuff.</p>
<p>I keep thinking of the super wealthy people</p>
<p>in first class on the Titanic,</p>
<p>as the Titanic is sinking.</p>
<p>Their money&rsquo;s not gonna help them.</p>
<p>The Earth is like Titanic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sinking, we&rsquo;re destroying the planets,</p>
<p>destroying the environment.</p>
<p>So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable</p>
<p>to be able to do that.</p>
<p>You need to be comfortable to not be</p>
<p>at that edge of survival,</p>
<p>because once you&rsquo;re at that edge of survival,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to think about anything else.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say to young people,</p>
<p>to the extent that you&rsquo;re able to do this,</p>
<p>and again, student debt and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p>is a big problem there too,</p>
<p>but really just try to find this combination</p>
<p>of what the world needs and what you need.</p>
<p>The other thing to say to young people is</p>
<p>that life is a lot shorter than you think,</p>
<p>and a 20 year plan is not really that long.</p>
<p>So if it takes you 20 years to get in a position</p>
<p>to do what you wanna do, go for it.</p>
<p>Have longterm plans.</p>
<p>The other part that was so important for me</p>
<p>to keep doing what I&rsquo;ve been doing,</p>
<p>basically now it&rsquo;s 49 years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve sort of been devoting my life</p>
<p>on psychedelics since I was 18.</p>
<p>But when I started, I didn&rsquo;t think it would ever work.</p>
<p>I just thought this is the only idea I have</p>
<p>in this crazy world, this is what I wanna work on.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had support from my family</p>
<p>that took care of my survival needs, so I could do that.</p>
<p>But I realized that if my happiness</p>
<p>was dependent upon accomplishments,</p>
<p>that I might never be happy,</p>
<p>that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m trying hard to get stuff to be better,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s better or not,</p>
<p>I can be happy at the end of each day, I tried.</p>
<p>And so I think you try to separate out</p>
<p>the goals that you have and your happiness</p>
<p>to whether you&rsquo;re trying hard.</p>
<p>The other thing I would say</p>
<p>is that everybody has this humanity within them.</p>
<p>So be very careful about dividing the world</p>
<p>into us and them, and try to&hellip;</p>
<p>So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that has taken a long time,</p>
<p>because I feel like drugs are illegal.</p>
<p>I always felt like the police were the predator</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m the prey.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re working with the police,</p>
<p>and the police have tremendous trauma</p>
<p>from the work that they do.</p>
<p>We have one police officer who is now going,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a full time police officer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also a psychotherapist.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going through our training program</p>
<p>to learn how to give MDMA therapy to other police officers.</p>
<p>And I met his police chief a couple of times,</p>
<p>he got permission from his police chief</p>
<p>to go to the second part of our training program,</p>
<p>which is where we give MDMA to therapists</p>
<p>who volunteer as a patient.</p>
<p>So we have just a couple of weeks ago,</p>
<p>dosed the police with MDMA.</p>
<p>And so I think this idea of those people</p>
<p>that are on the quote, other side,</p>
<p>try to see through that to their humanity,</p>
<p>to what their pains and suffering,</p>
<p>what their struggles are, to the extent that you can.</p>
<p>And that I think, and build long term relationships.</p>
<p>You never know what&rsquo;s gonna come around 20 years from now.</p>
<p>So you help some people try to keep these relationships</p>
<p>going 20 years from now, something could come.</p>
<p>And also be persistent.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been the key to success.</p>
<p>I mean, once the FDA or DEA figured out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going anywhere,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with us,</p>
<p>then we started getting some progress.</p>
<p>So a mix of patience and stubbornness</p>
<p>that gets things done.</p>
<p>Is there something you&rsquo;ve figured out</p>
<p>through your journey with psychedelics</p>
<p>about some of the big why questions about life?</p>
<p>Like, what the heck&rsquo;s the value of love?</p>
<p>Why does it suck so much that we die?</p>
<p>And for some of us, maybe it&rsquo;s the Russian in me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite terrifying, the notion of it.</p>
<p>Or the biggest why question of them all,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, what I&rsquo;ve discovered is</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t need answers to those questions.</p>
<p>That the fact that we can feel happy,</p>
<p>that we can love, that we can have moments of happiness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Figuring out these big questions, you can get lost in that.</p>
<p>And we all can come up with our answers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why is there life?</p>
<p>Why is there consciousness?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that we need those answers.</p>
<p>What we know is that we&rsquo;re social creatures,</p>
<p>that other people can make us happy by certain things,</p>
<p>we can make other people happy, that one life is enough.</p>
<p>So this other part about why is it so tragic that we die?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s tragic that we die.</p>
<p>So first off, if you believe in this collective unconscious,</p>
<p>but we have an impact that lasts.</p>
<p>But I think that for me at least,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been of the view that we should be grateful for death,</p>
<p>that death makes life precious,</p>
<p>that if we had an infinite amount of time,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a bit of a procrastinator about stuff,</p>
<p>particularly things that are really hard to do</p>
<p>and you just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then like, where&rsquo;d the day go?</p>
<p>I was gonna do this.</p>
<p>So if we had infinite life, we never died,</p>
<p>and would life be precious?</p>
<p>Would we do anything?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So my parents gave every Jewish new year,</p>
<p>they would make their new year&rsquo;s card.</p>
<p>And one of the quotes was fantastic.</p>
<p>It was just, we have to make up for the brevity of life</p>
<p>with the intensity of life.</p>
<p>Oh man, that is good.</p>
<p>Well, the end makes things precious.</p>
<p>Death makes life precious.</p>
<p>The end of this conversation makes it precious,</p>
<p>and which is a great way to end, Rick.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to you for a long time.</p>
<p>I share, you were very excited about the study.</p>
<p>I can now understand exactly why this is really promising.</p>
<p>This is really exciting, gives me hope about the future,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t come fast enough.</p>
<p>But like you said, I have to be patient and stubborn.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting</p>
<p>all your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor to meet you and talk to you.</p>
<p>Not a waste at all.</p>
<p>I really appreciated this time together.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Rick Doblin, and thank you to Theragun, ExpressVPN,</p>
<p>Blinkist, and Asleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Terrence McKenna.</p>
<p>Nature loves courage.</p>
<p>You make the commitment, and nature will respond</p>
<p>to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.</p>
<p>Dream the impossible dream,</p>
<p>and the world will not grind you under.</p>
<p>It will lift you up.</p>
<p>This is the trick.</p>
<p>This is what all the teachers and philosophers</p>
<p>who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,</p>
<p>this is what they understood.</p>
<p>This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.</p>
<p>This is how magic is done,</p>
<p>by hurling yourself into the abyss</p>
<p>and discovering that it&rsquo;s a feather bed.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
