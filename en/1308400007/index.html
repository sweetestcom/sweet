    <p>Hi friends, so in this episode, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about money the thing that everybody loves, but nobody wants to fucking talk about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna share with you a</p>
<p>Lot of the things I&rsquo;ve realized and a lot of the truths that I&rsquo;ve come to about money</p>
<p>Which have made me be a lot less constricted with it because I&rsquo;ve had a bad relationship with money for so long</p>
<p>And every time I&rsquo;d have to spend money on something that I didn&rsquo;t want to spend it on</p>
<p>I would get fucking pissed like I wear an aggravated</p>
<p>extra emphasis on the</p>
<p>Aggravated like it would piss me off to buy something or have to spend money on something that I didn&rsquo;t want to have to spend</p>
<p>It on like car insurance. I get it. Like I understand it&rsquo;s useful but like bitch get real health insurance</p>
<p>Fuck you</p>
<p>Birthday gifts and Christmas gifts that you feel obligated into you don&rsquo;t really want to fucking buy them</p>
<p>But you got to so then you go swiping your card and you get pissed off because you just spent money</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t want to spend I get it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still there sometimes</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really really hard to relax around money when you don&rsquo;t have it or you don&rsquo;t have enough or</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a predictable income and like assurance that</p>
<p>More is coming and then you throw on top of that</p>
<p>Maybe you do have a consistent income</p>
<p>But you hate your fucking job or you hate what you have to do</p>
<p>To make the money then you&rsquo;re gonna resent it then you resent the fact that you need it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna clear all this shit up and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a lot of the things that have helped me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not claiming to know everything. All right, so don&rsquo;t come at me and be mean</p>
<p>Before I get into all that I have some exciting news</p>
<p>So for those of you that don&rsquo;t know I have an app like a mobile app you can get on your phone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called positive focus and for a while. It&rsquo;s only been on</p>
<p>iPhones like it&rsquo;s only been in the Apple App Store</p>
<p>But I have exciting news because I just made a bunch of changes to it</p>
<p>But I also made a Google Play version. Well, I had it made I don&rsquo;t know how to code</p>
<p>But my app is basically positive notifications</p>
<p>Hence the name positive focus. It&rsquo;s notifications that come through your phone that are messages of</p>
<p>Positivity like cute little things and then there&rsquo;s also I throw in questions</p>
<p>To make you think for yourself because a lot of these affirmation apps and affirmation bullshit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the statement like you read it and it doesn&rsquo;t actually make you feel better</p>
<p>But if I ask you a question</p>
<p>That will guide your thoughts in a positive direction or it will like make you start to think in a certain way</p>
<p>If I can make that be positive great. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually gonna make you feel better</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s been on the app, but the part that I just added that I am so excited about is</p>
<p>an entire section of</p>
<p>Shadow work journal prompts. So if you don&rsquo;t know what shadow work is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically digging into your subconscious and fully meeting yourself and what I mean by meeting yourself is</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re finding out all the reasons conscious and unconscious of why you do what you do</p>
<p>Why you want what you want? Why you like what you like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know that saying you can only meet someone as far as they&rsquo;ve met their self</p>
<p>This is the way to fully meet yourself and you&rsquo;re gonna realize a lot of things</p>
<p>So my app will also serve as a resource of a place to go</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re struggling with something because anything you experience is based on the perspective you&rsquo;re holding about it</p>
<p>So you can go on my app and gain new perspectives about a situation you&rsquo;re dealing with and I know that seems simple</p>
<p>But sometimes it really is that simple of you flip a perspective about something you&rsquo;re going through and it changes the whole experience</p>
<p>You can go from suffering to not suffering by flipping one thought in your mind</p>
<p>so the way this is set up right now in my app is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a list of topics and there&rsquo;s 11 right now of different issues</p>
<p>You could be dealing with one of them is not having enough money. So if you like this episode at the end</p>
<p>Check out my app. There&rsquo;s a whole and I made it free</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole journal prompt about how to work through your beliefs and your perspectives about money</p>
<p>If you do test out my app and you like it</p>
<p>Please message me on Instagram and let me know and leave it a rating in the app store</p>
<p>Preferably five stars like you guys don&rsquo;t understand how much reviews actually help and it makes me feel good</p>
<p>you know like to know that people are actually liking something enough to go like rate it and</p>
<p>Everything in my app is everything that I&rsquo;ve had to work through</p>
<p>so the topics that I have listed right now are struggles I&rsquo;ve had and shit that I didn&rsquo;t know how to handle and</p>
<p>Then I had to learn how to handle it and then I now I&rsquo;ve converted that into how can I help others handle?</p>
<p>Whatever I was going through so my list right now only has 11 topics, but I&rsquo;m gonna continue to add to it</p>
<p>so I will definitely post about every time I add a new topic and if you have a topic in specific you want me to</p>
<p>Make a prompt about just message me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll link my Instagram account in the description of this podcast and I&rsquo;ll also put the link to my app if you want to check</p>
<p>All right now let&rsquo;s get into money. So the first thing I had to realize about it is</p>
<p>It is a tool at the base level money is a tool. That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a resource money is just a tool a resource whatever label you want to throw on it that can give you power</p>
<p>It can give you access to certain things. It can bring you convenience</p>
<p>It can free up your time like shit can just be a lot more efficient</p>
<p>Because you have money you can pay for better options of things but that word right there options, that&rsquo;s all money is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a resource for options</p>
<p>It really is that simple because money allows you to not have to exercise</p>
<p>Certain skills and do certain things to get something that you want if you look at a lot of rich people</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fucking dumb. They have no actual skills</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to handle things because they&rsquo;re used to paying people to do things</p>
<p>Do you think that most people that are filthy fucking rich know how to fix a toilet or change a light bulb or take a</p>
<p>Door off the hinges fix a door if it&rsquo;s squeaking. No half of them don&rsquo;t even know how to fucking drive</p>
<p>They have chauffeurs. They lack the basic fucking skills like people that have grown up in money like goddamn</p>
<p>I wish it was me, but people with money sometimes don&rsquo;t have as many skills and the people that don&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>Have a lot of fucking skills that are really useful</p>
<p>Like if you snatched money out of the world today, all these rich people would be the first ones dead</p>
<p>I swear because that&rsquo;s their only source of power</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like their main way of getting their needs met is they just pay to have shit done for them</p>
<p>The people that would survive are the broke ones that have had to fend for their self and learn how to take care of</p>
<p>Their self like it was</p>
<p>Do it yourself or it doesn&rsquo;t get done rich people have the option of if I don&rsquo;t want to do it myself</p>
<p>I can pay for it and it can still get done</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to talk shit on rich people because I&rsquo;m gonna be one one day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be one watch me watch me. I&rsquo;m gonna be a fucking billionaire Bezos. I&rsquo;m coming for your gig, bitch</p>
<p>So once you understand that all the stigma and all the bullshit that people have like thrown against money for so long</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the root of all evil and it&rsquo;s all this and it&rsquo;s all that no</p>
<p>money is not an</p>
<p>Animate object. It&rsquo;s not something that thinks</p>
<p>people have this idea and throw this shit around like money is something that</p>
<p>chooses who it goes to and you only get it if you are like being rewarded for something and</p>
<p>It only comes after hard work like all these things that people have said around money and built up around it</p>
<p>They demonize money</p>
<p>They give it like a mind of its own and I believed it for so long and there&rsquo;s so much shame and guilt</p>
<p>around wanting money</p>
<p>but like I just said money doesn&rsquo;t choose who it goes to I&rsquo;ve seen some of the</p>
<p>Stupidest motherfuckers make a lot of money and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people that are really smart be broke</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>Smarts, is it about being a good person?</p>
<p>Nope, not about that either because I&rsquo;ve seen some really shitty fucking rich people</p>
<p>Like some people that are just rotten at the core they are so unaware and oblivious and apathetic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad and I&rsquo;ve also seen people that are great people and they&rsquo;re broke dick</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to bring religion into it</p>
<p>But there are a lot of corrupt priests that are out here fucking the altar boys and fucking the children at the church</p>
<p>Driving around in goddamn Porsches and Maseratis because they&rsquo;re collecting money from the church</p>
<p>My point is not about the church</p>
<p>My point is about the money the money does not decide who it goes to it has no mind of its own</p>
<p>money does not care if you&rsquo;re a good person whether you&rsquo;re a bad person and</p>
<p>When I realized that it was like an immediate sense of relief. So if money is just a resource, it&rsquo;s a tool</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting more of it</p>
<p>Like if if something can bring you convenience and access to shit and options if something can make your life easier</p>
<p>Why would you not want more of it?</p>
<p>People trying to shame other people for wanting more money. It&rsquo;s not a moral fucking thing. That&rsquo;s not what money is. It&rsquo;s a resource</p>
<p>Why would you not want it? I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want everybody to sit with that for like two seconds. Why the fuck would you not want money? It&rsquo;s not evil</p>
<p>I just exposed that it&rsquo;s neutral</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good. It&rsquo;s not bad. It has no mind of its own</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inanimate fucking object people have just given it this like persona, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So this means you don&rsquo;t have to be worthy of money</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything to be worthy of having it or getting it</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t choose who&rsquo;s worthy and doesn&rsquo;t so that whole argument goes away</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s the priest worthy of it and anybody&rsquo;s opinion fuck. No</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s getting it and there&rsquo;s also starving children and people they don&rsquo;t have to be children</p>
<p>But there are starving people all throughout the world that don&rsquo;t have money. Do they deserve that?</p>
<p>Do they deserve to starve? No, there&rsquo;s no deserving</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no being worthy or unworthy and the whole thing about money being based off of hard work</p>
<p>No, the fuck it&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s what is taught</p>
<p>So people can justify being miserable with their fucking life if they think that is the only way to get money and you need money</p>
<p>To live they&rsquo;re gonna do it and they&rsquo;re gonna feel better about it because they&rsquo;re like, okay, it&rsquo;s normal to suffer</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to have to bust my ass and hate my life and work hard to get money. That&rsquo;s what people are taught</p>
<p>So they feel validated when they&rsquo;re busting their ass like yep. I&rsquo;m doing this, right? I they get to feel justified</p>
<p>Yep, I&rsquo;m doing it the right way when in real life</p>
<p>Hard work does not equal money</p>
<p>Yes, there are certain things where you need to work hard and put in effort into things but</p>
<p>Hard work does not always equal money</p>
<p>Because some people work so fucking hard for so little and some people</p>
<p>Barely work or do so little and get so much money</p>
<p>I know I dog Kylie Jenner on a lot of shit</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m talking about money, it&rsquo;s just so easy like any of the Kardashians and any influencer</p>
<p>They make ridiculous amounts of fucking money just to post on Instagram or to post on tik-tok</p>
<p>Like they will make a normal citizens</p>
<p>Salary yearly salary for one fucking post</p>
<p>So where does that equate hard work?</p>
<p>equals</p>
<p>Money, it doesn&rsquo;t because like I said Kylie Jenner the bitch is born into it</p>
<p>The bitch was born into the fame. Her mom is the best manager I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>I hope Kris Jenner writes a book</p>
<p>about like everything she does and knows about business because that fucking bitch is so smart and I</p>
<p>Envy her her children would be nothing without her and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. I&rsquo;m not dogging them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying how much I envy and how much I love Kris Jenner to prove my point of it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter</p>
<p>The kind of person you are because Kylie Jenner was born into it</p>
<p>She was born into a family that had some fame</p>
<p>She was born into a family that was able to capitalize on it and make a shit ton of money</p>
<p>People that are born into it are another example</p>
<p>Like some people are just born into better situations than others not better</p>
<p>But more financially abundant situations so to say hard work equals success</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the truth in some instances sure</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t go both ways because like I said all these famous people can make a post on Instagram</p>
<p>How hard is it to pull your fucking thumb out of your ass to click post on a picture?</p>
<p>not hard, but you got nurses or</p>
<p>Teachers out here actually making a fucking difference in the world</p>
<p>making peanuts compared to what these twats are posting on Instagram for</p>
<p>For Kylie Jenner to go do something that is actual hard work</p>
<p>She would make so much less money than what she makes by making a post on Instagram</p>
<p>if you make Kylie Jenner go teach a fucking high school or</p>
<p>Go do heart surgery make her go be a doctor like Kim Kardashian gonna be a lawyer great love that for you</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s gonna make so much less money</p>
<p>being a lawyer doing hard work then</p>
<p>Posting a fucking picture of her ass online. So the whole hard work equals making money is</p>
<p>bullshit and</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>That make an insane amount of money. I don&rsquo;t understand how they can be so</p>
<p>Fucking asleep and not help other people, but that&rsquo;s something I just don&rsquo;t understand and we&rsquo;re not gonna talk about that</p>
<p>But even with that that&rsquo;s another tactic people use. Oh, you need to give to others</p>
<p>You need to be giving you need to this you need to that when you have money</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s people with billions of dollars that are selfish as fuck and don&rsquo;t do anything but help their self</p>
<p>So be the whole like self-sacrifice and being like self-righteous shit that goes out the window, too</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things about money that don&rsquo;t make any sense when you actually look at them</p>
<p>so the next thing I&rsquo;m gonna tell you about money, I</p>
<p>Know some people are probably gonna get a little pissed off and I know I&rsquo;m gonna sound like one of these hippies</p>
<p>For like two seconds, but it&rsquo;s me. Okay, y&rsquo;all know me like I&rsquo;m not like that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna bring it around and like put it into real life in two seconds</p>
<p>So money is not an essential need to live humans need air water shelter food</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>Money can help you get access to these things. Yes</p>
<p>But as a physical human you do not need physical money or a credit card or any of this shit to actually</p>
<p>live</p>
<p>like I said, it is so much easier to have it but my point that I&rsquo;m trying to drive home is it is not a</p>
<p>need and</p>
<p>It was so important for me to realize that money was not a need for being human</p>
<p>Because I despise that I need things</p>
<p>Because my experience in my life</p>
<p>Whenever you need something someone can manipulate you</p>
<p>Whenever you want something it can be used against you now</p>
<p>that is two different things because if you need something versus if you want something if you want something you have more of a</p>
<p>Choice if you need something you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>So wanting money that is not bad money is simply a desire. It is not a need</p>
<p>To desire money, that&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s totally okay</p>
<p>But to convince yourself you need it</p>
<p>Someone like me that twists me up inside because I</p>
<p>Resent anything I need like I said because you can be manipulated you can be controlled</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of elements where your power can be taken away when you need something</p>
<p>So when I realized money is not an essential need for me to survive</p>
<p>I felt immediate relief like I almost wanted to fucking cry because I felt free. I was like, holy shit, dude</p>
<p>Just realizing that</p>
<p>Made me feel so much better the mindset. I&rsquo;ve kind of taken on since I&rsquo;ve realized that is money is a luxury and</p>
<p>Money is just a tool. Some people have it and some people don&rsquo;t but you can survive without it</p>
<p>Think about the old days. I know here comes the hippie shit where people would like trade things and</p>
<p>They would live in the fucking wilderness, babe. You can make it work</p>
<p>Okay, no one wants to fucking do that, okay, let&rsquo;s get real no one fucking wants to do that</p>
<p>But just bringing that truth up and making everyone aware of it</p>
<p>But I want to make sure everybody hears this that listens to my podcast like I want to scream this from the fucking rooftops</p>
<p>Like you will be okay, if you don&rsquo;t have money you will not die</p>
<p>I know that can sound ignorant in certain situations</p>
<p>but just take that belief for like two seconds and just like look at that for two seconds and</p>
<p>Also, if you believe that you will die if you don&rsquo;t have money you have zero faith in people</p>
<p>Because you think that no one would help you if you didn&rsquo;t have money because if you think of people with certain medical conditions</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t have money they could die because like anyone that can survive</p>
<p>Normal like me thank God I can run around saying oh, I don&rsquo;t need money. I&rsquo;m fine, but people that are born with disabilities or</p>
<p>Things that they need to actually buy in order to live</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re definitely gonna be way more resistant to the whole. Oh</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need money to live</p>
<p>That just reveals that we have no faith left in society</p>
<p>We have no faith left in human beings to help each other</p>
<p>Because the people that have so much are letting everybody else fucking suffer and this is something that&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit hard to</p>
<p>swallow if</p>
<p>You think that you will die if you don&rsquo;t have money you feel like you have no value you feel like you have nothing to</p>
<p>Offer because like I said in the beginning</p>
<p>Not having money teaches you to acquire skills</p>
<p>Now society constructs it where if you don&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>They make it seem like you&rsquo;re worthless when you are actually so fucking valuable you have the skills that these rich people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>The working class is being paid to do the things that these rich fucks can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>Whether they don&rsquo;t know how to do it, or they&rsquo;re not willing to do it</p>
<p>But if you think you will die if you don&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>You think no one could see any value in you and want to help you and to keep you around</p>
<p>You feel like you can&rsquo;t meet needs for anyone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core belief there and</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t blame you for that because I was thinking the same thing for so long because this is what we&rsquo;re taught</p>
<p>Everything is constructed for us to believe this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so funny once you become aware of that because you realize the rich or the worthless and</p>
<p>The ones that have to work for money are the ones that are actually powerful</p>
<p>Because what happens tomorrow everybody stops going to work. What happens the rich will fall</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should do that because that&rsquo;s just gonna cause too much fucking chaos, but</p>
<p>You get my point. I&rsquo;m the type person if I see someone needs help. I&rsquo;m gonna fucking help them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how I am if I was working out a hospital and I had a patient come in and they needed</p>
<p>certain supplies or certain things and they can&rsquo;t pay for it or afford it and I see that they need it and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re struggling without it if I can steal it for them and give it to them</p>
<p>I 1,000 percent will a hundred times over and I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about the hospital</p>
<p>But my point is everyone&rsquo;s faith in humanity is shot</p>
<p>no one actually thinks anyone would be there for them and help them because it seems like everyone is just left to struggle and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way society is now like no one sees you struggling and helps you they shame you they make fun of you</p>
<p>Having a genuine heart and genuinely caring for one another is gone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s out. Like that&rsquo;s like not the vibe as you fucking freaks like to say my point has been proven</p>
<p>I think about the whole you have no faith in people and you shouldn&rsquo;t like I don&rsquo;t either</p>
<p>I have trust no one tattooed on my hand that doesn&rsquo;t come from living a life of</p>
<p>Experiences where I can rely on people and trust people and to be able to think that people will help me</p>
<p>I have that shit tattooed on my head as a fucking reminder</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to look at what I&rsquo;m saying as right or wrong or you don&rsquo;t have to agree with it or believe it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying if you look at things from a grand scale</p>
<p>Money is not a need to a physical human to survive</p>
<p>Because it is what a fucking tool it is just a tool to help you get the things you need to survive</p>
<p>water food shelter</p>
<p>Connection to because we&rsquo;ve been eating each other y&rsquo;all just don&rsquo;t want to fucking have that conversation</p>
<p>the other part of my relief around this realization is</p>
<p>Since money is not a need I don&rsquo;t have to suffer for it</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is I don&rsquo;t have to work a job</p>
<p>I fucking despise for it</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have money I can figure out other ways to meet my needs like you have to get creative</p>
<p>You need to think critically like you need to be able to</p>
<p>Trust yourself that if you don&rsquo;t have money, you will still be able to survive you need to like sit down and</p>
<p>Think of the like what the shit that you would do like prepare for it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that helped me a lot. Once I realized this I was like, okay since mr</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fucking need money all of a sudden. I</p>
<p>Like put it to the test in my own head. I was like, okay</p>
<p>So if for the next 30 days I spend zero dollars, how would I?</p>
<p>Continue to do what I do or survive and what would be the consequences like I fully sat down and</p>
<p>Went through everything I would need to do to be able to survive and it helped me relax around money</p>
<p>So much because I realized yo</p>
<p>this shit is just a social construct like social media and</p>
<p>Society and the news and every the way shit is now is just so backwards</p>
<p>But at the core of it you can survive you will be more than okay</p>
<p>I know it seems like catastrophic and it seems fucking terrible to even think about it</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re scared of something you need to face it you need to be able to look at it and</p>
<p>Prepare for it because that will give you the confidence and make you less scared which makes you less resistant to it</p>
<p>Because whatever you resist persists</p>
<p>So if you keep fucking resisting not having money you&rsquo;re gonna keep not having money</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna job that you hate if you&rsquo;re aware. I don&rsquo;t need money to survive</p>
<p>You immediately right there take your power back over your life so you can look at your job and say, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware. I don&rsquo;t need this but I want it because it makes things easier</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna choose to continue working this job</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna choose the whole thing</p>
<p>The whole power thing is in the ability to choose and once you&rsquo;re aware that you can choose</p>
<p>Your whole perspective and attitude towards going to that shitty booty ass job</p>
<p>You hate will change because you know that you&rsquo;re choosing it now</p>
<p>Like I said with the whole awareness thing if you&rsquo;re aware that you&rsquo;re choosing it</p>
<p>You might want to choose different and if you want to go look for a new job do it you can choose that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your power. You can choose whatever the fuck you want to do</p>
<p>So money not being a need means it can&rsquo;t be held against me when you convince yourself. You need money</p>
<p>You can be controlled by it. It&rsquo;s like water if you tell me</p>
<p>Leo you can&rsquo;t have water and you hold me back from it and you&rsquo;re like, okay</p>
<p>the only way you can have water is if you go become a prostitute or you go work this fucking job you hate or</p>
<p>XYZ I would feel like I had to do it because if that&rsquo;s my only way to get water</p>
<p>Which is something I need to live I&rsquo;m fucked if I don&rsquo;t get it if that is the absolute</p>
<p>Only way I can get the water then I&rsquo;m gonna have to do it if I want to live, but even then I get a choice</p>
<p>What I would do personally my stubborn ass is I would start looking for other ways to get water</p>
<p>Before I just committed because if you have a need</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something people can use to bargain with you to</p>
<p>Cross your own boundaries and to give up your boundaries and your self-respect and make you do shit. You don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>When someone holds something over your head that you need they can control you now that you&rsquo;re aware that money is not a physical need</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t hold that shit over your head anymore. And if they do it&rsquo;s because you choose it</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to throw away your boundaries for money. You don&rsquo;t have to throw away your self-respect</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do shit</p>
<p>You can choose to</p>
<p>But you now have the awareness that it&rsquo;s a choice</p>
<p>You do not have to and that becoming aware</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a choice is gonna help you stop</p>
<p>Resenting money like I have to go to this fucking job</p>
<p>To not even make enough to fucking do what I want to do</p>
<p>All I can do is pay a bill and jerk off. I can&rsquo;t even fucking go on vacation</p>
<p>Like you know what?</p>
<p>I mean you get that frustration of like I have to go do this thing</p>
<p>I hate because I have to have money because I have to pay my bills or I will die</p>
<p>Because you convinced yourself of that</p>
<p>Question it if you don&rsquo;t believe me question it question your own life and the way that you look at shit</p>
<p>Because the awareness that I just shared that I gained helped me completely</p>
<p>Relax around that because now it&rsquo;s not oh my god. I have to go work this fucking job. I hate it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to go work it. Like I said money gives you options, but if you can start thinking of options</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find the money</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways to meet your needs you just have to look for them</p>
<p>Money is not the only way. It&rsquo;s a great one. It&rsquo;s a fucking easy one, but it&rsquo;s not the only way</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s talk about some illusions of</p>
<p>money and what I mean by that is like</p>
<p>People seeming like they have a lot more than they do</p>
<p>Very common on social media, but it&rsquo;s also very common in real life</p>
<p>So because you see someone with something number one, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s theirs</p>
<p>It does not mean it belongs to them number two</p>
<p>If you see someone with something it does not mean that they bought it or paid for it</p>
<p>Someone else could have bought it. They could have been gifted it. It could be a loner</p>
<p>Like I said, it might not be theirs. But what do we do when we see someone with something? We just fucking assume</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way we are</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just your brain just fills in gaps when you don&rsquo;t know something it just fills things in you can&rsquo;t control that</p>
<p>But when you notice that you start your brain starts filling in certain gaps certain things you can question what&rsquo;s being filled in</p>
<p>You know, I mean for an example if you see some girl walking on the road and she got a fucking Birkin</p>
<p>For those of you don&rsquo;t know what a Birkin is. It&rsquo;s an Hermes bag</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s one of the most expensive bags in the world. They start at like $10,000 for a fucking purse. I know right?</p>
<p>so you see some girl with a Birkin and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re immediately gonna be like fuck. How did that bitch so I can do that by herself?</p>
<p>But if you catch yourself and you&rsquo;re like, no, I don&rsquo;t know who bought it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually hers. Is it her friends?</p>
<p>Did she steal it from somebody?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many more things that can be filled in than what your brain just told you other than she bought it herself</p>
<p>So you never know some bitches actually do buy their own Birkins and I love that for them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be selling the shit out of some hair extensions</p>
<p>But let me throw a little shit at social media because you guys know I like to do that</p>
<p>With influencers and people that have a lot of followers a lot of the times the things that you see them with</p>
<p>They got gifted or they got for free</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of brands and companies that will give influencers certain things</p>
<p>Just because their followers seeing them with something will make their followers want it like Emma Chamberlain getting sponsored by Louis Vuitton</p>
<p>Was the best fucking move they could have made because all these girls</p>
<p>Want to look like Emma Chamberlain and that they associate Emma Chamberlain with a Louis Vuitton bag or the Louis Vuitton brand</p>
<p>This whole generation as they grow up and get money, they&rsquo;re gonna start wanting that shit</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a big branding move, but you think Emma Chamberlain is paying for a motherfucking thing from Louis Vuitton?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. You think she&rsquo;s paying for her own flight to go to Paris for the fashion shows?</p>
<p>Absolutely the fuck not. Maybe I don&rsquo;t know but we fucking know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over here winking at you like we&rsquo;re in the same room hanging out together like wink wink bitch</p>
<p>We know they&rsquo;re actually like paying for everything</p>
<p>Another thing you don&rsquo;t realize is these vacations you see influencers taking they&rsquo;re paid for I know this one guy</p>
<p>I follow on snapchat. He was like transparent about it</p>
<p>He went to Bora Bora for two weeks</p>
<p>two whole ass weeks</p>
<p>With his little girlfriend and then they&rsquo;re these two couples that were friends</p>
<p>They both went and they were posting about it and I followed them the whole trip. Like I was like eating this shit up</p>
<p>I loved it</p>
<p>Like they were posting about their trip everything they ate everywhere they went everything they did</p>
<p>They were posting posting posting posting posting and they had a blast like you can&rsquo;t do much in Bora Bora</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like stuck to your resort</p>
<p>But they were posting the shit out of this resort and it just looked like they were just enjoying their vacation</p>
<p>Nothing seemed sponsored. Nothing seemed like fishy like they were advertising</p>
<p>But someone had swiped up and asked him a question of how he affords</p>
<p>Vacations like this because this guy goes on vacations all the time and he came clean and said oh</p>
<p>The resort paid for everything for me to come they bought his flight they paid for all his room</p>
<p>They paid for all his food. They paid for</p>
<p>Everything as long as he posted about it and made the resort look cool</p>
<p>So he just had like a fucking $50,000 vacation for free. So you&rsquo;re looking at these influencers</p>
<p>Like how are y&rsquo;all affording like $50,000 vacations every goddamn month? Like how are y&rsquo;all doing this? They&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting some portion of the trip</p>
<p>Compensated so even if they buy their flight there the hotel they&rsquo;re staying at gave him a free room and that shit&rsquo;s expensive</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an illusion that people</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t realize is actually going on because I was shocked when I found that out and realized how common that was</p>
<p>like people are sponsored for fucking everything and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in ways that you don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re sponsored like just come do this and we&rsquo;ll pay you to come here and post</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re here. What that shit happens with clubs and bars and all kind of shit like in bigger cities</p>
<p>Like these insta models and all these influencers you see showing up places. They&rsquo;re getting paid to be there or</p>
<p>their entire bottle section and all their shit that they&rsquo;re drinking is free as</p>
<p>Long as they come and post about it and bring their other influencer friends and everybody looks like they&rsquo;re having a great time</p>
<p>I actually saw this like firsthand at</p>
<p>Icebox the jewelry store in Atlanta</p>
<p>I was there one time and the influencer Jackie Anna. I don&rsquo;t know if I should say her name or not</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing bad. I do have one thing to say about her and she is pretty as fuck in real life</p>
<p>Okay, like she&rsquo;s not gonna know about this podcast</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a tiny podcast who gives a shit</p>
<p>But that bitch pretty is fucking real life and I just got to say that like the way her body is built the way she</p>
<p>Moves her mannerisms like that bitch is just like perfect</p>
<p>And she was really sweet like most people that are really hot are assholes sometimes or influencers are kind of like dicks</p>
<p>But she was like really sweet and like was very</p>
<p>Humble and was like cool and she likes bitch spent some money</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Let me just clear that up because where I&rsquo;m about to go with this story bitch spent some money</p>
<p>She bought some bracelets and they were fully iced out like she spent a good chunk a change in there</p>
<p>But then when like she was walking by this one case like going to check out</p>
<p>She saw this necklace and I think it was like two grand or some shit like that and she was like, oh, oh my god</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna buy everything else, but can I post for this necklace and</p>
<p>The guy was like, hang on. Let me go get the manager and the manager comes over and he checked how many followers</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got on Instagram and</p>
<p>Then he was like, yeah, just post the story and I&rsquo;ll give it to you</p>
<p>So homegirl posted a literal fucking 24-hour story and got a $2,000 necklace for free</p>
<p>like I saw it with my own eyes and I was shocked like there was no paper receipt that he just handed her the</p>
<p>Necklace and I was like shell-shocked because like you you like speculate, you know</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t realize that shit actually was a real thing the day</p>
<p>that I like gained enough of a following to do this like my tick-tock has like</p>
<p>92,000 followers and I&rsquo;m like bitch I can get a necklace</p>
<p>No, but the day that I can do this and people are paying me to do shit</p>
<p>I will be telling all of you about it. I will be so transparent about it</p>
<p>If that day comes like I will get more enjoyment coming on this podcast and telling you. Oh, I got this for free</p>
<p>Oh, I got that for free who wants to go to Bora Bora, bitch</p>
<p>We got a free trip, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like I would be so excited to tell everybody about it</p>
<p>Other people like to hide it because they&rsquo;re embarrassed and they like to flex and like have this whole image of like what it is</p>
<p>But I look at it like a celebration of like yo, look what you guys gave me</p>
<p>you know what I mean, and I would give the fuck back with shit like I would honestly probably go to icebox and ask to</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>Posts for things air quote posts for things and then do giveaways and like give away the shit that I just got for free to</p>
<p>You guys you know what? I mean? Because you&rsquo;re the only reason I would be in that position</p>
<p>but anyway, that&rsquo;s not my point my whole point with all that was</p>
<p>People really be getting shit for free just because they have followers</p>
<p>Okay, so I want to finish this off with the last tip that really helped me</p>
<p>With spending because like I said in the beginning like when I go to spend money, I&rsquo;m stressed out. I don&rsquo;t like gay</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like spending money. So what I did was create a budget and I know you&rsquo;re like, yeah, Leo shut the fuck up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m turning the podcast off annoying, but I&rsquo;m not gonna be one of those people that preaches a budget</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna share like what it did for me</p>
<p>so I made a budget of</p>
<p>Every week the amount of money I bring in the amount of money</p>
<p>I have to set aside for certain things like so that all of my bills and everything is paid for</p>
<p>And then I have the amount that I can spend and the amount that I save so my spending money</p>
<p>I can do whatever I want with it</p>
<p>I can fucking throw it off a bridge if I want and everything else I have is paid, you know</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like I give myself free reign with this specific amount of money</p>
<p>Every month and when I go to spend this money</p>
<p>I feel a lot more relaxed around it because I&rsquo;m not like worried and stressed that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>Prevent me from paying one of my other bills or at the end of the month</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s helped me like not be so constricted around spending money and I think that would really help like bitch</p>
<p>I know where every single dollar I spend goes. I&rsquo;m not like that dramatic with it, but I</p>
<p>Keep track of what I spend</p>
<p>So that I cannot be stressed about it. Does it make sense? Like some people would look at</p>
<p>budgeting as something stressful like to count</p>
<p>Everything that they spend they&rsquo;re looking at that like oh my god, that&rsquo;s fucking stressful. I don&rsquo;t want to do that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of time yada yada</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at it like that anymore because I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m finding out how much I get to spend</p>
<p>You know, like how much I can freely fucking spend like if I have 200 bucks for this week</p>
<p>I can spend on whatever I want if I think oh, I want to go out to eat with my friend</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to feel guilt. I don&rsquo;t have to be anxious. I don&rsquo;t have anything that I feel other than oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited. I can go do this</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have a toolbox and I said money is a tool you need to keep track of how many tools are in your</p>
<p>Toolbox before you try to go fucking build something, you know, you need to be aware of what you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>before you go and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what helps me. Like I like to count what&rsquo;s in my toolbox before I go building shit</p>
<p>So those are some of the things that help me relax around money</p>
<p>I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and like took something from it. I do look forward to hearing what you think</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind, could you leave my podcast a five-star rating?</p>
<p>Thank you so much. And if you want to hear me talk about any other topics</p>
<p>Message me on Instagram. Like I said, I&rsquo;m gonna link it in the description and check out my app</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think of that too. I like feedback. I like to talk</p>
<p>I like to like converse, you know, I want to know everybody&rsquo;s thoughts and opinions and feelings</p>
<p>Anyways, thank you so much for listening and I will talk to you again next Sunday</p>
