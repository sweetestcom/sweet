    <p>hi friends how are you</p>
<p>today i hope you are</p>
<p>having a wonderful day so far my name is bailey syrian</p>
<p>and today is monday</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>let me take a deep breath i&rsquo;m a little nervous</p>
<p>today i don&rsquo;t know why well</p>
<p>excuse me bailey</p>
<p>you know why i get nervous before i film sometimes</p>
<p>well a lot of the times because</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ve been doing this for a while</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>think by now i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get nervous but i still do</p>
<p>i mean have you ever</p>
<p>tried filming a video</p>
<p>seriously have you ever tried it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awkward as hell you&rsquo;re staring at a camera</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re alone in a room</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re pretending to talk to everybody</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nobody around</p>
<p>except for you</p>
<p>and your makeup brushes</p>
<p>okay if you are new here hi my name is bailey syrian</p>
<p>and on mondays i sit down and i talk about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime and you like makeup</p>
<p>i would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you on mondays</p>
<p>warning today&rsquo;s story contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue and strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s been a while you guys it&rsquo;s been a while since</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked about a cannibal</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re squeamish</p>
<p>a vegetarian</p>
<p>or maybe you just ate</p>
<p>maybe skip this one come back to it</p>
<p>because today baby girl lisa we are talking</p>
<p>about a cannibal you</p>
<p>guessed it because i said it eighteen times by now</p>
<p>on top of him being a cannibal</p>
<p>what makes his</p>
<p>story even worse is the fact that</p>
<p>this guy is not even in jail</p>
<p>nope he&rsquo;s roman out free</p>
<p>free is a little bird i mean</p>
<p>yeah for sure he</p>
<p>definitely went to jail for like a whole minute</p>
<p>but then they let him go and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably wondering like bailey will if he&rsquo;s a cannibal</p>
<p>why is he out walking free i know that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>today i don&rsquo;t know what to say cannibals</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t live with them</p>
<p>we could live without them actually but</p>
<p>other than that i will stop rambling and let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story so</p>
<p>ise sagawa have you</p>
<p>heard of him</p>
<p>yeah you have oh my bad</p>
<p>sorry about that well if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t this guy was a</p>
<p>total dork he was born on</p>
<p>april 26 1949 so he&rsquo;s a taurus</p>
<p>you know how for the most part</p>
<p>most of these killers and</p>
<p>these bad people</p>
<p>their upbringing is like so</p>
<p>awful so so horrible</p>
<p>and it kind of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to say it makes</p>
<p>sense as to why they turned out the way</p>
<p>they did but it kind of does you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>but you say is that opposite</p>
<p>person where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how how how</p>
<p>how i don&rsquo;t know so</p>
<p>ise he was born into a wealthy</p>
<p>a wealthy family</p>
<p>a very well off family they were living in</p>
<p>japan very traditional</p>
<p>but very loving that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for him</p>
<p>his father was very</p>
<p>successful he was a businessman</p>
<p>he was like president of</p>
<p>a water industries</p>
<p>and he made a lot of</p>
<p>money and he was doing very</p>
<p>well okay also</p>
<p>he says grandfather</p>
<p>he was an editor for one of the</p>
<p>major newspapers in</p>
<p>japan and his</p>
<p>mother he says</p>
<p>mother she took care of the family she was like the</p>
<p>stay at home mom so they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re doing great</p>
<p>financially that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>everything else is</p>
<p>great but you know when ise&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother was pregnant with him</p>
<p>she actually fell down</p>
<p>like a flight of</p>
<p>stairs and she almost</p>
<p>miscarried ise</p>
<p>and it was said that he was born prematurely</p>
<p>and like he was so</p>
<p>small he could fit into the palm of his father&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>he had a younger brother who was born</p>
<p>two years after him</p>
<p>but they were very</p>
<p>close and they almost</p>
<p>raised them like twins</p>
<p>when ise was a baby</p>
<p>he developed enteritis</p>
<p>which is a disease of the</p>
<p>small intestine</p>
<p>and to treat this the doctors</p>
<p>would inject potassium</p>
<p>and calcium into his body</p>
<p>which led to ece</p>
<p>eventually recovering</p>
<p>but the downside</p>
<p>was that the disease was leaving him very</p>
<p>frail and just</p>
<p>sickly looking</p>
<p>which made him feel</p>
<p>very insecure</p>
<p>it was said because of this</p>
<p>ise was more</p>
<p>of an introvert</p>
<p>he was a bit of a loner in</p>
<p>school he didn&rsquo;t really have like</p>
<p>any friends but he</p>
<p>absolutely loved</p>
<p>school especially</p>
<p>literature because it was a way for him to</p>
<p>escape the world that he was in and</p>
<p>going like these</p>
<p>grand adventures and his imagination</p>
<p>you know where like he just wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>small little guy or</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t the weak</p>
<p>sickly guide</p>
<p>he could be</p>
<p>the hero of the story</p>
<p>using his imagination so</p>
<p>he loved reading</p>
<p>he loved books stories</p>
<p>literature like i said because of this he</p>
<p>would end up getting his master&rsquo;s degree</p>
<p>in english literature</p>
<p>ysei would say that from a</p>
<p>young age he noticed</p>
<p>that something within himself</p>
<p>from a very early age</p>
<p>was going on</p>
<p>like something was different</p>
<p>ise would in a</p>
<p>later interview</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>when growing up his</p>
<p>uncle would come over to the</p>
<p>house and they</p>
<p>would play a game</p>
<p>where like his</p>
<p>uncle would</p>
<p>dress up as a</p>
<p>scary boy eating</p>
<p>giant and he would</p>
<p>chase the kids around the</p>
<p>house pretending he was gonna</p>
<p>put them in a big pot and cook them</p>
<p>and then eat them</p>
<p>which okay sure you know fine</p>
<p>but where this</p>
<p>story goes it&rsquo;s like oh shit</p>
<p>you know but okay</p>
<p>great game but the</p>
<p>uncle would</p>
<p>chase issei and his brother around and then his father</p>
<p>would rescue them and it was just all</p>
<p>fun and games there was like nothing no bad shenanigans</p>
<p>going on but e say</p>
<p>would say like</p>
<p>this game it was more than a game for him it was like</p>
<p>this awakening</p>
<p>he remembers</p>
<p>having like a mixture of terror</p>
<p>and excitement</p>
<p>while playing this game</p>
<p>i mean it was thrilling to him</p>
<p>e say would say that this just was one of</p>
<p>those moments that</p>
<p>just stuck in his life you know</p>
<p>and he would say that at that very moment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he just really became</p>
<p>fascinated with stories and</p>
<p>fairy tales</p>
<p>about monsters and dragons</p>
<p>especially when they involved eating people so</p>
<p>with that being said of course</p>
<p>hansel and gretel</p>
<p>was one of his favorites</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>hansel and gretel to be</p>
<p>quite honest with you i remember they</p>
<p>lived in a candy</p>
<p>house but they get eaten</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been so long did they get eaten</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little fucked up what was that all</p>
<p>about we read that as kids</p>
<p>are we okay</p>
<p>ysey and his</p>
<p>brother said that they grew up in a very tame</p>
<p>home a very loving home a very normal</p>
<p>home um one</p>
<p>thing though the family</p>
<p>never talked</p>
<p>about sex sex was just something nobody</p>
<p>talked about okay</p>
<p>so this thing happened</p>
<p>um when e say</p>
<p>got his first</p>
<p>boner his first bonner</p>
<p>he at first said that</p>
<p>he thought he was seriously ill he&rsquo;s like oh my god</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with me</p>
<p>like this isn&rsquo;t normal like he</p>
<p>freaked out he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what was going on</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no internet</p>
<p>or anything back then so what do you do</p>
<p>again since he has no sex education</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>fiddle your diddle you know i&rsquo;m saying so</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s like an option</p>
<p>but he has this</p>
<p>thing and he&rsquo;s feeling like</p>
<p>these weird feelings and isa said</p>
<p>it led him into</p>
<p>participating in some very questionable acts</p>
<p>for example like having the family dog lick his</p>
<p>i know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what he&rsquo;s doing but he did that i know why did he</p>
<p>bring the dog into this i don&rsquo;t know but he did</p>
<p>ysei said again</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>young when he&rsquo;s doing this he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>experimenting</p>
<p>and ysei said that like when this happened</p>
<p>his sexual desires</p>
<p>start to become more</p>
<p>distorted you know</p>
<p>i wonder why</p>
<p>so as he say gets</p>
<p>older he only gets</p>
<p>weirder okay in</p>
<p>first grade he said that</p>
<p>he saw something that just got his</p>
<p>motor running</p>
<p>again he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>first grade okay</p>
<p>he found one of his</p>
<p>classmates like very</p>
<p>attractive so the fellow</p>
<p>classmate is wearing</p>
<p>shorts as one does when it&rsquo;s hot outside</p>
<p>and he remembered</p>
<p>looking at this girl in her</p>
<p>shorts and thinking to himself man</p>
<p>that is a delicious looking thigh</p>
<p>i want to bite it</p>
<p>now remember you say is in</p>
<p>first grade</p>
<p>that means he&rsquo;s like six or</p>
<p>seven years old</p>
<p>and you know for someone who is</p>
<p>six or seven years old that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little different</p>
<p>as time went on</p>
<p>ysei was growing more and more</p>
<p>aware of his</p>
<p>fantasies of</p>
<p>eating thighs and</p>
<p>how it just wasn&rsquo;t normal</p>
<p>and at the age of 15</p>
<p>he did try to seek help from a</p>
<p>psychologist</p>
<p>but when he found out</p>
<p>that he needed to go in person</p>
<p>and that he actually</p>
<p>needed help</p>
<p>it was serious</p>
<p>he never went</p>
<p>i guess he just like couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring himself</p>
<p>to actually</p>
<p>tell his parents that he needed help so he just</p>
<p>never said anything and he</p>
<p>never went to therapy</p>
<p>his parents</p>
<p>never came out and said anything on record</p>
<p>about their son so it&rsquo;s really unclear</p>
<p>if they knew what was</p>
<p>going on in</p>
<p>his head or if they even knew that he needed help</p>
<p>i doubt it i i</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t seem like they talked at all</p>
<p>like yeah they showed love but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re like hey how was your day today</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s 1964</p>
<p>and issei is 24 years old</p>
<p>at this time he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>studying at the</p>
<p>university of tokyo</p>
<p>when he sees a tall beautiful german woman</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like walking in the</p>
<p>street and he&rsquo;s just feeling</p>
<p>very attracted to her</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>would be like oh you know i wonder how i</p>
<p>could like get to know her she&rsquo;s so beautiful i</p>
<p>wanna talk to her</p>
<p>um and just like get to know them like a normal person</p>
<p>but he say as you probably</p>
<p>learned he really isn&rsquo;t like most people</p>
<p>so instead of</p>
<p>thinking to himself like</p>
<p>how can i talk to her he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking to himself like</p>
<p>i wonder if i could get</p>
<p>close to her so i can eat her</p>
<p>so one summer he decides to lean into</p>
<p>those dark feelings</p>
<p>those dark desires he was having</p>
<p>and see where it leads him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to</p>
<p>think like you</p>
<p>could be walking</p>
<p>minding your own business and someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking about eating you like what a bummer</p>
<p>anyway so he</p>
<p>was kind of like following this girl i guess he</p>
<p>would see her from time to time like taking the same</p>
<p>train and what not</p>
<p>and so he decides to just follow her home one</p>
<p>night okay it is waiting outside of her apartment</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s waiting to see like her</p>
<p>lights go off so once he knows that this</p>
<p>woman has gone to bed</p>
<p>he decides to</p>
<p>break in through her window</p>
<p>and sees that she&rsquo;s laying in bed</p>
<p>sleeping naked</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s feeling real jazzed he&rsquo;s like this is my moment</p>
<p>this is it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>given so many interviews</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like you can hear it directly from him</p>
<p>but he said that</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t wanna kill her</p>
<p>he just wanted to take a bite of her bottom her bum</p>
<p>yeah like she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna know or</p>
<p>something anyways he&rsquo;s looking for something</p>
<p>heavy around to like</p>
<p>knock the woman out with</p>
<p>the first thing he sees</p>
<p>an umbrella</p>
<p>an umbrella</p>
<p>sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna work so he grabs the umbrella</p>
<p>goes up to her bed he&rsquo;s like leaning over her</p>
<p>right and i</p>
<p>guess he kind of like</p>
<p>brushed up against her something</p>
<p>but she wakes up</p>
<p>and she starts</p>
<p>screaming as any of us</p>
<p>would do he says a very very like</p>
<p>small man and</p>
<p>so anyone over</p>
<p>like five two can take him down and that&rsquo;s what she did</p>
<p>she wakes up she</p>
<p>starts screaming him she grabs his arms she</p>
<p>throws him to the ground</p>
<p>and then she calls police</p>
<p>you go girl so the</p>
<p>woman ends up calling police and</p>
<p>he say was arrested</p>
<p>right and he was being</p>
<p>charged with attempted rape</p>
<p>if only they knew what his real goal was you know</p>
<p>but of course he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna tell him</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>gonna do that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like sure i was</p>
<p>gonna rape her</p>
<p>sounds about</p>
<p>right well like i mentioned earlier</p>
<p>esay&rsquo;s father was</p>
<p>super wealthy</p>
<p>and when he finds out that his son was in trouble</p>
<p>he pays a large</p>
<p>unknown settlement</p>
<p>to the victim</p>
<p>and the charges end up being</p>
<p>dropped i think it&rsquo;s safe to say that you say</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn a damn</p>
<p>thing right like</p>
<p>thanks daddy</p>
<p>i mean good for the girl she got a</p>
<p>large settlement</p>
<p>but you know you know</p>
<p>he should have to pay the price</p>
<p>teach him a goddamn lesson</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so after that</p>
<p>failed attempt he says desires didn&rsquo;t just go away nene</p>
<p>in fact they just got stronger</p>
<p>and more persistent</p>
<p>he knew he had to eat a woman</p>
<p>this was his one</p>
<p>dream in life</p>
<p>and he needed to</p>
<p>fulfill it in</p>
<p>order to be happy</p>
<p>dream big they say</p>
<p>dream big so then</p>
<p>you say ends up</p>
<p>going on a vacation</p>
<p>a little holiday</p>
<p>and he goes on like a cruise</p>
<p>to greece and</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s on this cruise</p>
<p>he meets like</p>
<p>a butcher and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super interested into this guy and this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh okay like</p>
<p>let me tell you</p>
<p>about my job</p>
<p>he sees like what&rsquo;s it like being a butcher</p>
<p>you know what do you use to cut the meat with</p>
<p>is there a certain technique</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just trying to get butcher</p>
<p>basics one o one</p>
<p>and the butcher</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s feeling very flattered</p>
<p>that someone is so interested in his profession</p>
<p>and he stays with</p>
<p>he say for a good amount of time explaining how</p>
<p>to butcher me</p>
<p>he say plays it all cool like yeah</p>
<p>thanks i wanna become a butcher one day</p>
<p>you know but secretly</p>
<p>he was taking notes</p>
<p>knowing that</p>
<p>he was going to probably most likely</p>
<p>apply them to cutting up</p>
<p>people meet</p>
<p>and not so much cowl</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure if the butcher</p>
<p>knew then what we know now you know</p>
<p>this would have</p>
<p>never happened</p>
<p>and okay i&rsquo;m gonna jump</p>
<p>ahead here a little bit</p>
<p>because this part just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so upsetting</p>
<p>because okay so e say does terrible</p>
<p>things which we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get into</p>
<p>but he ends up e say</p>
<p>writes a letter to this butcher and</p>
<p>telling him</p>
<p>thank you so much for taking the</p>
<p>time to explain to me like how to do all this blah blah</p>
<p>blah and by this</p>
<p>point it was</p>
<p>his story you say</p>
<p>story was pretty well known</p>
<p>the butcher</p>
<p>never responded to his letter</p>
<p>but um i just thought wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super effed up</p>
<p>cause now that guy the butcher</p>
<p>has to live with</p>
<p>that for the rest of his life like i told this person</p>
<p>how to cut meat and he</p>
<p>applied it towards actual people</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s just so fucked up</p>
<p>is that not</p>
<p>i literally was like i</p>
<p>would be livid</p>
<p>so then in nineteen eighty one he say he</p>
<p>graduates from college</p>
<p>and he ends up moving to france to pursue a phd</p>
<p>in comparative</p>
<p>literature at sorbonne university</p>
<p>which is like a very</p>
<p>fancy smancy</p>
<p>university i hear</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that so when</p>
<p>he moves to like a</p>
<p>latin quarter of</p>
<p>paris france an area</p>
<p>which is super known for</p>
<p>its student life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very lively lots of people</p>
<p>bistros ysei</p>
<p>is kind of getting adjusted to this new life of his and</p>
<p>he would say that</p>
<p>every night almost</p>
<p>every night he</p>
<p>would go out and he</p>
<p>would bring a sex worker</p>
<p>back home with him</p>
<p>and instead of paying them for you know some</p>
<p>sweet love in</p>
<p>he would wait for the moment when they had like</p>
<p>their backs towards him</p>
<p>and he would try to shoot them</p>
<p>like he was trying to</p>
<p>kill somebody</p>
<p>but luckily</p>
<p>i guess he would freeze</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t chicken out so</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>but he was trying to get some practice in</p>
<p>so time goes on</p>
<p>and in one of his</p>
<p>classes he meets a woman</p>
<p>named renee and he immediately falls in love with her</p>
<p>renee heartfelt was 25 years old and she was also</p>
<p>studying to get her phd</p>
<p>in french literature</p>
<p>she was originally from holland</p>
<p>and it was said that renee was like five foot 10</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>tall stunning</p>
<p>super smart and she</p>
<p>spoke three languages</p>
<p>so again ise</p>
<p>meets renee in one of his classes</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>friendly with her whatever and he asks her that</p>
<p>or he goes up to her</p>
<p>and he says that he&rsquo;s looking for someone to help him</p>
<p>study german</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s struggling he</p>
<p>asked renee like hey</p>
<p>would you be open to</p>
<p>teaching me he then went</p>
<p>on to tell renee that he had a very wealthy father who</p>
<p>could pay for her to help him</p>
<p>and just pay</p>
<p>her for her time renee was friendly with ise</p>
<p>and she agreed</p>
<p>to help him with his german</p>
<p>and over time the two</p>
<p>of them formed like a little friendship ise was really</p>
<p>smart and he</p>
<p>enjoyed renee&rsquo;s company because she was also really</p>
<p>smart too and</p>
<p>renee like that</p>
<p>about him they bonded they had a lot in common</p>
<p>they had a lot of common interest</p>
<p>so ise is in love</p>
<p>with renee and thought she was</p>
<p>absolutely beautiful</p>
<p>he even started to</p>
<p>write her love letters and he</p>
<p>would invite her to different art exhibits or concerts</p>
<p>and renee saw him as a good friend she agreed to go</p>
<p>out dancing with him from time to time because she just</p>
<p>enjoyed his company</p>
<p>and a letter renee</p>
<p>wrote to her parents</p>
<p>back at home</p>
<p>she said that she</p>
<p>found um e say</p>
<p>friendly and</p>
<p>intellectual</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m getting at is like she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they were friends they seemed yeah</p>
<p>friends but i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>um renee saw him as just that a</p>
<p>great friend</p>
<p>great company</p>
<p>she enjoyed him</p>
<p>as just that</p>
<p>and he says love for renee is just growing</p>
<p>he is wanting more</p>
<p>than just being friends</p>
<p>he wants to</p>
<p>do more than just wine and dine</p>
<p>her he wants to wine and dine</p>
<p>her if you catch my</p>
<p>draft he wants to eat her</p>
<p>so ysei would</p>
<p>later explain</p>
<p>that one of the reasons he really wanted to eat renee</p>
<p>was because she was healthy and</p>
<p>beautiful two characteristics he felt that he lacked</p>
<p>and he considered himself weak ugly</p>
<p>small he wanted to absorb her energy through</p>
<p>eating her i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his mind&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know dude</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t freaking</p>
<p>know you guys but that&rsquo;s his reasoning but he knew in</p>
<p>order to eat her he has to kill her first</p>
<p>which is something that he seems</p>
<p>to be struggling with he said in interviews that if</p>
<p>renee would have allowed him to</p>
<p>drink her urine</p>
<p>or would have</p>
<p>given her some of her</p>
<p>pubic hairs</p>
<p>that alone might have satisfied his desires</p>
<p>but he was too afraid to ask in the</p>
<p>first place so</p>
<p>killing her in his mind was easier</p>
<p>than asking her for her</p>
<p>urine and pubic hairs</p>
<p>either way it&rsquo;s awkward man what was it</p>
<p>gonna do with the urine</p>
<p>ew so one evening</p>
<p>ysei invited renee over for dinner and</p>
<p>he was asking her to</p>
<p>read him a poem by one of his favorite german writers</p>
<p>and she was like oh okay sure you know</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning remember</p>
<p>so she sits</p>
<p>down at his desk and she&rsquo;s reading him the poem</p>
<p>isse he had a</p>
<p>rifle hidden in his drawers on the</p>
<p>other side of the room</p>
<p>and there are different reports that say isse</p>
<p>actually tried to</p>
<p>shoot rene this</p>
<p>night when she wasn&rsquo;t paying attention</p>
<p>but that the gun</p>
<p>ended up jamming</p>
<p>and i guess renee didn&rsquo;t hear it or even</p>
<p>have any idea</p>
<p>that it happened</p>
<p>behind her back because she was like sitting reading</p>
<p>and e say just pretends that nothing happened i</p>
<p>guess so renee took off for the night</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like bye you know whatever she&rsquo;s no idea</p>
<p>what he says really thinking</p>
<p>and he went just full</p>
<p>blown creep</p>
<p>status one hundred</p>
<p>and just went off</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re really into someone</p>
<p>and the scent of like</p>
<p>their cologne</p>
<p>or perfume it kind of</p>
<p>lingers after they</p>
<p>leave and you&rsquo;re like oh my god</p>
<p>like it smells like them</p>
<p>but nothing more</p>
<p>than that like not in a creepy way you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>like oh my god like</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>just me no that&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>whatever well it was kind of like that ise</p>
<p>was doing that but it was to the hundredth degree ise</p>
<p>said that that evening when renee left</p>
<p>he smelled the chair</p>
<p>where she had been sitting he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>sniff up all of her scent</p>
<p>and then he even went as far as to licking the</p>
<p>chair she sat in</p>
<p>ysei wanted renee all to himself</p>
<p>and he made a little promise with himself that he was</p>
<p>going to eat her</p>
<p>which would</p>
<p>allow him to possess her</p>
<p>forever on june 11th 1981</p>
<p>isse invites</p>
<p>renee over for dinner</p>
<p>again this time</p>
<p>he told renee that he had a cassette recorder</p>
<p>and he wanted to record her reading</p>
<p>the poem aloud</p>
<p>that way he</p>
<p>could like practice</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like okay sure</p>
<p>sounds good poor thing</p>
<p>and she goes over to issay&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house that evening</p>
<p>renee arrives to issay&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house right</p>
<p>great so he welcomes her in</p>
<p>they sit down on the floor</p>
<p>he offers her some tea but what i</p>
<p>guess renee didn&rsquo;t know was that he</p>
<p>spiked her tea with whiskey</p>
<p>now i couldn&rsquo;t get clarification though if</p>
<p>she did know or if she didn&rsquo;t know i feel like he would</p>
<p>taste it but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to say</p>
<p>maybe she didn&rsquo;t know because</p>
<p>there was no straight answer and let&rsquo;s not assume</p>
<p>anyways so he</p>
<p>spikes her tea with</p>
<p>whiskey and they&rsquo;re just sitting on the</p>
<p>floor and they&rsquo;re chatting and e say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s waiting for the alcohol to kick in</p>
<p>you know for</p>
<p>renee to be a little bit more</p>
<p>loose a little bit more</p>
<p>relaxed and then</p>
<p>after some time passes and he notices that renee</p>
<p>does seem a little bit more relaxed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he uses this opportunity to</p>
<p>confess his love for her</p>
<p>and he tells renee that he wants to take her to bed</p>
<p>for some you know winky dinky</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>her that over time he&rsquo;s been having all</p>
<p>these emotions and feelings for her and</p>
<p>thinks she&rsquo;s wonderful x y and z</p>
<p>you get up now this moment this i</p>
<p>guess this was a</p>
<p>shock to renee</p>
<p>because she had making</p>
<p>it clear that they were friends</p>
<p>and she was taking a back and she&rsquo;s like oh dear like</p>
<p>oh no i am busy around that time you were</p>
<p>thinking about doing that i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>sorry like i thought we were just friends</p>
<p>she went on to tell</p>
<p>you say i really</p>
<p>appreciate your</p>
<p>friendship and i just want nothing more than that</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just trying to be really polite and</p>
<p>you know not piss him off</p>
<p>right but she&rsquo;s bummed i</p>
<p>guess because this is the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the moment your friendship</p>
<p>is kind of over he say response by saying that he</p>
<p>understands</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like well let&rsquo;s just get to the poetry though</p>
<p>so he gets up</p>
<p>he gets the book of poetry he wanted her to read</p>
<p>hands it to her she sits back down at his</p>
<p>desk and he</p>
<p>starts a tape recorder</p>
<p>so when she&rsquo;s sitting at</p>
<p>issa&rsquo;s desk her back is faced</p>
<p>towards him like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s facing a window and renee</p>
<p>begins reading the poem</p>
<p>well he say</p>
<p>has his gun ready</p>
<p>he comes up behind her slowly</p>
<p>with a twenty two</p>
<p>caliber rifle in his hand</p>
<p>bang bang he</p>
<p>shoots her in the neck</p>
<p>i guess there&rsquo;s there was like a</p>
<p>brief moment</p>
<p>where renee kept reading the poem</p>
<p>before she fell into the floor</p>
<p>dead and the</p>
<p>whole thing was being recorded</p>
<p>ese said after he shot renee</p>
<p>she falls to the ground and then he like fell into</p>
<p>shock himself and then he fainted</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like get it together guy</p>
<p>okay if you&rsquo;re gonna do this you can&rsquo;t be fainting</p>
<p>freaking loser so then he comes back to</p>
<p>and when he comes back to</p>
<p>he is like great</p>
<p>i get to like</p>
<p>carry out my original plan</p>
<p>now&rsquo;s my chance i get to eat renee</p>
<p>i mean he had no</p>
<p>other choice</p>
<p>now he already followed through with for step one</p>
<p>ise said that he laid a towel</p>
<p>under her head</p>
<p>and then he undressed her</p>
<p>and he had everything</p>
<p>planned out in his mind like knowing</p>
<p>which part he was gonna</p>
<p>start eating first</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know he</p>
<p>seemed to have like an obsession with eating the booty</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how else to put that because like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he really wanted to do he wanted to take a big old</p>
<p>chomp into her butt</p>
<p>and he wanted to</p>
<p>start with her</p>
<p>right cheek</p>
<p>first it&rsquo;s kind of ironic i</p>
<p>guess but he didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>blood and he feared that the left</p>
<p>cheek would be more bloody</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s closer to the</p>
<p>heart so okay</p>
<p>you know alright sure lol so</p>
<p>while following his</p>
<p>dreams ysei notices that his</p>
<p>teeth are not</p>
<p>sharp enough to</p>
<p>penetrate someone&rsquo;s skin</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like oh dear like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about this</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like oh my god</p>
<p>fruit knife i have a fruit</p>
<p>knife in the</p>
<p>kitchen let me go get that</p>
<p>so he goes to get the fruit</p>
<p>knife he comes back he&rsquo;s trying to cut her with that</p>
<p>but again that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sharp enough either</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s goes back to his</p>
<p>kitchen he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just looking for anything any kind of tool that will be</p>
<p>sharp enough to help him out here and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got nothing</p>
<p>so he decides to make a</p>
<p>quick little trip to the</p>
<p>store where he</p>
<p>he purchases a curved meat knife</p>
<p>so he gets the curved meat</p>
<p>knife comes back</p>
<p>it works and he proceeds to cut renee&rsquo;s body up</p>
<p>starting with her butt is a</p>
<p>booty guy i guess</p>
<p>so issei proceeds to eat parts of renee&rsquo;s body mostly</p>
<p>focusing on her</p>
<p>her boobage</p>
<p>her butt and her face</p>
<p>and he was kind of</p>
<p>experimenting a little bit he</p>
<p>would either</p>
<p>cook the meat</p>
<p>or he would try it raw</p>
<p>he would try with different</p>
<p>sauces mustard ketchup</p>
<p>vinegar red</p>
<p>whatever you use you know</p>
<p>butter you say in interviews said that he was surprised</p>
<p>at the corn</p>
<p>colored nature</p>
<p>of human fat</p>
<p>and he found the meat soft and odorless</p>
<p>and it melted in his</p>
<p>mouth like raw tuna</p>
<p>specific but</p>
<p>if you were curious now you know he said</p>
<p>a lot more but i just you know i just we don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>go into super graphic</p>
<p>details you get the gist of it he</p>
<p>fried some of the meat</p>
<p>and he tried baking different</p>
<p>parts but he didn&rsquo;t like the greasy consistency</p>
<p>that he was getting a lot of the times</p>
<p>he just was</p>
<p>experimenting with different techniques on how to eat</p>
<p>the human meat so during all of this he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cutting renee&rsquo;s body up and</p>
<p>e say said that</p>
<p>he was getting really</p>
<p>excited if you know what i mean</p>
<p>he was getting a boner</p>
<p>and just during this</p>
<p>whole process</p>
<p>he tells renee that he loves her for the</p>
<p>first time and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like dude get a fucking grip</p>
<p>what are you doing he said that</p>
<p>night he brought renee</p>
<p>um her body into bed with him and like</p>
<p>slept with her cuddled</p>
<p>uh knowing that the next day he was probably</p>
<p>going to have to dispose of her body because um</p>
<p>most likely like</p>
<p>flies and stuff</p>
<p>would come around</p>
<p>but ysei was</p>
<p>excited because the next day he realized that</p>
<p>there were no</p>
<p>flies just yet</p>
<p>and her body</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t seemed to gone bad there was no like weird</p>
<p>smell there was no fly so it</p>
<p>still must be good</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like fuck yeah i get another day to experiment</p>
<p>so he goes on to cut up</p>
<p>again her her skin her body he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sampling different parts of her</p>
<p>and he upgraded to an electric carving</p>
<p>knife at this point</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry for</p>
<p>laughing but</p>
<p>what are you doing yes he&rsquo;s got an electric carving</p>
<p>knife he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go upgrade really quick</p>
<p>he gets an electric carving</p>
<p>knife cuts up the rest of her body</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s putting them in ziplock</p>
<p>little baggies putting them in the fridge for later</p>
<p>right saving it for</p>
<p>snacks or something and then during each</p>
<p>stage of dismembering the body</p>
<p>he took photographs of</p>
<p>each process to keep for his</p>
<p>scrapbook i</p>
<p>guess memories</p>
<p>but soon enough the</p>
<p>flies showed up</p>
<p>and once the flies</p>
<p>came and started to</p>
<p>swarm around</p>
<p>the body he knew it was time to get rid of it</p>
<p>it was done it was over</p>
<p>so in order to get rid of the body the evidence</p>
<p>poor bernay</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like let me just chop her up</p>
<p>into smaller</p>
<p>pieces and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>shove her in</p>
<p>these two suitcases i have</p>
<p>so he does just that</p>
<p>of course along the</p>
<p>way cutting her up further to fit into the suitcases</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sampling and taking bites of different parts</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>flies on them so is saying</p>
<p>came up with a plan</p>
<p>his plan was to put rene&rsquo;s body into the two suitcases</p>
<p>and then take it down to the</p>
<p>local lake and drop</p>
<p>them in the lake hoping it</p>
<p>would sink and</p>
<p>never be found</p>
<p>again so with this in mind</p>
<p>he say he packs up he loads the</p>
<p>two suitcases and he calls up a cab</p>
<p>and he asks them to take them</p>
<p>to a public park</p>
<p>which is like five</p>
<p>miles from the city center of</p>
<p>paris it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>second largest park in paris it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about two almost</p>
<p>three times the size of central park in new york</p>
<p>and this park has like several gardens</p>
<p>several lakes there&rsquo;s even a</p>
<p>zoo and an amusement park everyone goes there and like</p>
<p>hangs out and it&rsquo;s not like a</p>
<p>quiet place to go</p>
<p>where nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna see you execute this</p>
<p>awful plan but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his idea</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s around 8 p</p>
<p>m and issa calls up a cab driver</p>
<p>to come pick him up and take him down to the park and</p>
<p>when the cab driver picks him up</p>
<p>he helps isa</p>
<p>out with the two suitcases he brought</p>
<p>and the driver even made a comment to isa joking like</p>
<p>what is there a body in here or something</p>
<p>literally just joking because the suitcases were so</p>
<p>heavy and you know when you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>small talk like that you say something</p>
<p>stupid like</p>
<p>but you got a dead body in here</p>
<p>one out of every thousand times it may just be the case</p>
<p>but i guess e say just kind of</p>
<p>laughed awkwardly</p>
<p>and said like</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s full of books i have tons of books in</p>
<p>these suitcases</p>
<p>the suitcases were</p>
<p>super heavy though so when</p>
<p>e say was dropped off at the park</p>
<p>he was trying to</p>
<p>carry these um suitcases</p>
<p>and people are</p>
<p>just kind of staring at him at the lake just</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>small scrawny man struggling with</p>
<p>these two heavy suitcases</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like dragging</p>
<p>them down to the lake like a little weirdo you know</p>
<p>so a lot of people are just sitting there kind of</p>
<p>watching minding</p>
<p>their own business but they&rsquo;re like he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know what is this guy doing</p>
<p>because the park was a very popular spot as he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about how</p>
<p>crowded it would be</p>
<p>even though it was late it</p>
<p>still there was like a lot of people there</p>
<p>and he was feeling very overwhelmed</p>
<p>trying to drag</p>
<p>these suitcases around</p>
<p>because he felt like everyone was staring at him which</p>
<p>they were so he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrong eventually he said he</p>
<p>found like a little</p>
<p>quiet place</p>
<p>where there wasn&rsquo;t that many people around</p>
<p>and he starts pushing the suitcases</p>
<p>down towards the lake towards the water</p>
<p>but he got to a</p>
<p>point where he was</p>
<p>really exhausted so he like suitcases are on the ground</p>
<p>took a break</p>
<p>and just kind of walks a little bit forward</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s admiring the really pretty</p>
<p>sunset mind you</p>
<p>his suitcases</p>
<p>are kind of like back behind him a little bit</p>
<p>and then he hears someone</p>
<p>shouting behind him it&rsquo;s a man it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>older man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hanging out at the park and he saw the two suitcases</p>
<p>and he thought like</p>
<p>somebody had left them or forgotten them he saw issay</p>
<p>standing not far</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like hey man like are</p>
<p>these your suitcases</p>
<p>and issa said he thought</p>
<p>about saying yes but</p>
<p>he want the managers like go away</p>
<p>so instead he said</p>
<p>no and just walked away</p>
<p>which i feel like that wasn&rsquo;t the right move</p>
<p>um so he just</p>
<p>walks away so the man</p>
<p>who asked he say like hey are</p>
<p>these your bags he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super curious he&rsquo;s like who left</p>
<p>these you know two suitcases here let me open them up</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a million dollars in there</p>
<p>so the man he opens up the suitcases and he sees</p>
<p>something like a bloody</p>
<p>bed sheet that my</p>
<p>guess is a had</p>
<p>wrapped renee&rsquo;s body in</p>
<p>but he just sees like a bloody bed</p>
<p>sheet and then he</p>
<p>screams murder</p>
<p>like really loud</p>
<p>so everyone</p>
<p>in the park is looking over like what the hell is</p>
<p>going on like what</p>
<p>cause this man seems very</p>
<p>upset as one</p>
<p>would be you know</p>
<p>he say he didn&rsquo;t even flinch he just kept walking</p>
<p>um he just aborted mission</p>
<p>walked back</p>
<p>headed straight to his</p>
<p>apartment as fast as he could</p>
<p>without drawing any attention to himself</p>
<p>so police were obviously called out to the scene</p>
<p>and they investigate the suitcases and</p>
<p>asked the witnesses at the park like what they saw</p>
<p>multiple people</p>
<p>reported seeing a small</p>
<p>asian man pushing</p>
<p>the suitcases down to the end of the lake</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really the only information anyone had</p>
<p>so the suitcases were</p>
<p>taken to the</p>
<p>local mortuary</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>fully unpacked</p>
<p>and the gruesome</p>
<p>scene began to tell its</p>
<p>story they discovered the gunshot</p>
<p>wound at the nape of the neck</p>
<p>and portions of her flesh</p>
<p>seemed to be missing</p>
<p>photographs were taken</p>
<p>of the body for evidence reports</p>
<p>but sadly they</p>
<p>would not stay contained within the police files</p>
<p>somehow somebody with</p>
<p>greedy intentions it was someone working on the inside</p>
<p>they took those</p>
<p>photos and they sold them to pot like a popular french</p>
<p>magazine which led to them being published all over</p>
<p>but it is a horrifying</p>
<p>scene they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen anything like this and it&rsquo;s obvious to them like</p>
<p>it looks like somebody ate</p>
<p>this you know so they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what to do with this</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for investigators to find</p>
<p>e say though</p>
<p>police reached out to</p>
<p>local cab companies</p>
<p>asking if any of the drivers had a client that</p>
<p>maybe had some really</p>
<p>heavy suitcases you know well</p>
<p>sure enough</p>
<p>one of the drivers came forward and said like</p>
<p>hey i had a client yeah just</p>
<p>yesterday who i picked up who had some really</p>
<p>heavy suitcases</p>
<p>and shortly</p>
<p>after that e say was arrested</p>
<p>so police go and arrest e say and</p>
<p>i guess lucky for them e say didn&rsquo;t even try to pretend</p>
<p>like he was innocent</p>
<p>the cops came in</p>
<p>they arrested him</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>confessed like that they were like hey you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under arrest for murder</p>
<p>and his response was</p>
<p>i killed her to eat her flesh</p>
<p>so case closed you know like</p>
<p>great we got it</p>
<p>confession after being arrested for renee&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>he says daddy once</p>
<p>again came to</p>
<p>his rescue paying for a top defense lawyer</p>
<p>despite there being multiple eyewitnesses</p>
<p>evidence found in he</p>
<p>says apartment</p>
<p>and his confession to the</p>
<p>crime he was</p>
<p>locked up put away for two years he was waiting for</p>
<p>trial and then the</p>
<p>judge found</p>
<p>ysei legally insane and unfit to</p>
<p>stand trial</p>
<p>so the charges</p>
<p>were dropped</p>
<p>the french courts sentence ise</p>
<p>to be held indefinitely</p>
<p>aka forever</p>
<p>in a mental institution though so you</p>
<p>know at least he&rsquo;ll be locked up there and</p>
<p>maybe get some help during this time rene&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>never spoke to the</p>
<p>media and on the</p>
<p>other hand isse</p>
<p>like his parents were</p>
<p>paying for any</p>
<p>anything that had to do with the</p>
<p>legal side of things</p>
<p>and then both of the parents</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t talk to</p>
<p>media but they also</p>
<p>shielded their son</p>
<p>isse from the public eye they just really protected him</p>
<p>and just paid for</p>
<p>everything he</p>
<p>says brother</p>
<p>actually showed public support</p>
<p>but it turns</p>
<p>out like he&rsquo;s also an interesting case all on his own</p>
<p>he did an interview for forbes</p>
<p>and he says brother said that he himself had his own</p>
<p>urges that he</p>
<p>kept to himself like he didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about it</p>
<p>and not even</p>
<p>he say knew</p>
<p>about his urges himself he wanted to eat people too</p>
<p>is what i&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>his brother said in an interview that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll probably die not knowing why he had</p>
<p>these feelings</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s anyone else there like out there like him</p>
<p>but he say was</p>
<p>quick to like turn down his brother&rsquo;s comments i</p>
<p>guess he would publicly say like oh my brother</p>
<p>his thoughts are not as bad as my thoughts</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m way</p>
<p>worse than he is</p>
<p>and it was like some really</p>
<p>weird competitive i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>better cannibal</p>
<p>than you are</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it was very</p>
<p>strange but there seems to be some kind of competition</p>
<p>going on issei</p>
<p>was sent to a mental institution</p>
<p>and a japanese author came by to</p>
<p>visit he wanted to</p>
<p>write a story</p>
<p>and then wanted to get issei&rsquo;s account of his</p>
<p>crime so this author went</p>
<p>out and interviewed him</p>
<p>for his book</p>
<p>it was later called in the fog</p>
<p>which included issay&rsquo;s account of his kill</p>
<p>and it would go on to sell like over 200 000 copies</p>
<p>and this book</p>
<p>it also featured all of the</p>
<p>horrifying photos that no one</p>
<p>should have seen now because of this book</p>
<p>the attention</p>
<p>you say was getting was widespread and</p>
<p>he was becoming a big</p>
<p>media sensation</p>
<p>everyone just wanted to know like what what what</p>
<p>huh you know</p>
<p>the curious cast</p>
<p>that we are just trying to figure it out</p>
<p>now the french</p>
<p>were not too</p>
<p>excited about this</p>
<p>because they were receiving a lot of negative</p>
<p>publicity because</p>
<p>ysei was technically</p>
<p>still in france</p>
<p>so um because they didn&rsquo;t like all this negative</p>
<p>press they were getting</p>
<p>they decided it</p>
<p>would be best to deport him back to</p>
<p>japan so ise</p>
<p>was sent to a hospital in</p>
<p>tokyo and the</p>
<p>psychologist they&rsquo;re examining him</p>
<p>and they declare him to be sane</p>
<p>but evil and his</p>
<p>sexual perversion was his only</p>
<p>motivation for murder</p>
<p>does that mean he say goes back to jail and</p>
<p>court and all that</p>
<p>no nene japanese authorities did try to put him on</p>
<p>trial for murder but the charges got dropped</p>
<p>and the french refused to hand over the necessary</p>
<p>court documents</p>
<p>so there was like no evidence for a</p>
<p>trial in japan</p>
<p>and without any evidence</p>
<p>linking ise</p>
<p>to renee&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>the japanese</p>
<p>courts they were unable to keep ise</p>
<p>further it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense he was</p>
<p>literally held for 15</p>
<p>months and then</p>
<p>because the french authorities</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t hand over the documents they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>charge him with anything and i was trying to</p>
<p>understand why that happened i really was but um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know why they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t handle over the documents so</p>
<p>after fifteen</p>
<p>months of being held he was able to</p>
<p>check himself out of the hospital</p>
<p>on august twelve</p>
<p>nineteen eighty six</p>
<p>free to just live his life</p>
<p>okay so the response in</p>
<p>japan was a lot different</p>
<p>than the response in france</p>
<p>and his crime</p>
<p>it kind of made him a</p>
<p>cultural icon in</p>
<p>japan i guess</p>
<p>and you say he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t shy away from it he embraced it</p>
<p>anyway so japanese</p>
<p>magazine called murder in mind</p>
<p>asked ise to</p>
<p>write an article</p>
<p>about the murder he committed</p>
<p>which again led to more</p>
<p>media attention</p>
<p>and outrage so over the years following renee&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>ise&rsquo;s crime continued to</p>
<p>catch people&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>even a verse in the rolling</p>
<p>stones song too much blood</p>
<p>um they make a little</p>
<p>shout out to um</p>
<p>e say it was inspired by him his fame</p>
<p>kept him busy writing books a</p>
<p>comic book with</p>
<p>graphic illustrations of his</p>
<p>crime and making</p>
<p>countless guest</p>
<p>speaker commentator</p>
<p>and talk show appearances</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>just really milking it</p>
<p>i mean again it was a way for him to make his money</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;m mad at him or like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame you anyways</p>
<p>he even appeared in several</p>
<p>movies and documentaries ysei had a</p>
<p>small part in a sexploitation film playing a sado</p>
<p>sexual voyeur</p>
<p>and he was getting a lot of porn</p>
<p>offers to be</p>
<p>quite honest with you like there was</p>
<p>another one where</p>
<p>they a producer</p>
<p>asked e say to participate in a movie</p>
<p>where they had him doing really weird</p>
<p>things like they</p>
<p>would measure his strength</p>
<p>while they were making fun of him</p>
<p>like a humiliation fetish</p>
<p>ysei also took a role in a porno</p>
<p>where he and his co star they</p>
<p>lived together in an apartment</p>
<p>for like 24</p>
<p>hours and they</p>
<p>would have sex</p>
<p>it seemed kind of like a reality porn show</p>
<p>ysei then asked the co star like hey can i</p>
<p>drink your urine</p>
<p>and your spit</p>
<p>very odd but i</p>
<p>guess some are into it</p>
<p>but then plot</p>
<p>freaking twist</p>
<p>after the two of them participate in</p>
<p>sexual relations</p>
<p>ysei reveals to the co star</p>
<p>about his past</p>
<p>he tells her that he is a cannibal</p>
<p>and he shares</p>
<p>his autobiography with her showing</p>
<p>her photos of what he had done to his</p>
<p>victim renee</p>
<p>and all of this is being filmed and</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like reality so you&rsquo;re getting this girls</p>
<p>true response to the situation</p>
<p>and the co star is just in like severe</p>
<p>shock and she</p>
<p>starts crying</p>
<p>later in life the two of them ysei</p>
<p>and the co star</p>
<p>they actually became like real life friends</p>
<p>and ysei said that she</p>
<p>would help him like</p>
<p>curb his cannibalistic desires</p>
<p>by having this friendship i</p>
<p>guess i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>whole thing is very odd</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s really all i</p>
<p>could say about that</p>
<p>you know as time went on attention around issa</p>
<p>died down a bit</p>
<p>and then in two thousand nine</p>
<p>issa sat down and gave an interview with</p>
<p>vice magazine</p>
<p>and he said that well he</p>
<p>might not be in jail</p>
<p>trying to make a living</p>
<p>while being a</p>
<p>known murderer and cannibal</p>
<p>was just a terrible punishment</p>
<p>woo hoo in addition to</p>
<p>royalties he was receiving from books and interview</p>
<p>fees he also did reviews for different restaurants</p>
<p>i guess that&rsquo;s fitting</p>
<p>in a way i don&rsquo;t know and then</p>
<p>e say he picked up</p>
<p>painting in his free time and he was</p>
<p>focusing painting on</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s nude bodies</p>
<p>and he even sold like a number of them</p>
<p>in order to help pay for some of his bills</p>
<p>e say seemed to be kind of</p>
<p>scraping by and</p>
<p>in the interview you</p>
<p>could tell he&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>he wants you</p>
<p>to feel bad for him but i&rsquo;m not sure what you</p>
<p>expect or what he expects</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t feel bad for you i i</p>
<p>think you should be in prison bro sorry yeah</p>
<p>i really think you</p>
<p>should be locked up</p>
<p>during this</p>
<p>vice interview</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking him like hey are you a</p>
<p>changed man</p>
<p>you know have you</p>
<p>changed your ways have</p>
<p>you at least</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re one</p>
<p>lucky guy right you</p>
<p>literally murdered</p>
<p>and ate someone and you&rsquo;re walking free</p>
<p>the chances of that happening are slim</p>
<p>to none have you curbed your desires to eat people</p>
<p>and then you say said no</p>
<p>no that even on his way to the</p>
<p>train station that day of the interview</p>
<p>he saw a girl with really nice legs</p>
<p>and he was thinking</p>
<p>about wanting to eat someone</p>
<p>again before he died</p>
<p>so over the years ysei has just</p>
<p>existed really he&rsquo;s been living outside of</p>
<p>tokyo in 2013</p>
<p>he was hospitalized because he had</p>
<p>something going on in his</p>
<p>brain where</p>
<p>there was like no oxygen</p>
<p>or blood flow getting to his</p>
<p>brain and it permanently</p>
<p>damaged his nervous</p>
<p>system so he lives</p>
<p>alone he&rsquo;s confined to a wheelchair</p>
<p>and he requires</p>
<p>daily assistance from either caregivers</p>
<p>or from his younger brother</p>
<p>he also had problems with his stomach area so</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t even eat</p>
<p>normal food he has to eat through a feeding tube but</p>
<p>his newest goal in life you you are probably wondering</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s to be killed slowly and painfully</p>
<p>but most of all by a beautiful woman</p>
<p>if possible</p>
<p>dream big they say</p>
<p>dream bag poor renee</p>
<p>not only was she murdered</p>
<p>eaten but the</p>
<p>photos of her remains were shared</p>
<p>with a lot of people you</p>
<p>know and then the guy who murders her he wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>really punished at all for his</p>
<p>crime i just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s safe to say like he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn a damn</p>
<p>thing from it</p>
<p>how do we know he didn&rsquo;t do it again</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t he probably did it</p>
<p>again we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i wish this one had a happier</p>
<p>ending but i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s kind of comforting knowing that e</p>
<p>say is confined to his wheelchair</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t do any more damage</p>
<p>unless he has help</p>
<p>but then again</p>
<p>if his younger brother is working with him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because he seemed a little</p>
<p>off as well you know</p>
<p>is someone watching them</p>
<p>is anyone paying attention to</p>
<p>those brothers</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hope that my friends is the</p>
<p>story of ysei</p>
<p>sagawa he is</p>
<p>gross he&rsquo;s gross like ew</p>
<p>ah if you watch any of the interviews with him</p>
<p>well thank you so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i love and</p>
<p>appreciate you</p>
<p>guys so much oh let me know who you want me to talk</p>
<p>about next week</p>
<p>but other than</p>
<p>that i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
