    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is James Winston the third, the nine of clubs from Kansas.</p>
<p>In February 2020, James was sitting in his Wichita, Kansas apartment when suddenly two</p>
<p>people barged in in the dead of night, shot him and fled, leaving behind a heartbroken</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>Investigators think they know the motive behind James&rsquo;s murder, but their investigation has</p>
<p>been frustrated by a lack of cooperation from the very people that they think hold</p>
<p>the answers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was just before 3 a.m. on February 16th, 2020, and a woman named Tara Hampton had just</p>
<p>arrived at her friend James&rsquo;s apartment complex.</p>
<p>James had called Tara up an hour or so prior and had invited her to come over and hang</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>When Tara walked up to his door, she noticed that it was slightly ajar.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>He had told her over the phone that he&rsquo;d leave it unlocked, and she could just let herself</p>
<p>in whenever she got there.</p>
<p>So she did just that.</p>
<p>She stepped inside and looked down the hall into James&rsquo;s bedroom, where she saw him lying</p>
<p>on his bed.</p>
<p>She walked towards his room, and she must have assumed he was asleep because he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>moving or responding to her, but then she saw blood, and lots of it.</p>
<p>Tara pulled out her cell phone and frantically dialed 911.</p>
<p>Within minutes, first responders were on scene.</p>
<p>It was clear James had been shot multiple times, but he was still somehow clinging to</p>
<p>life, though unconscious, so EMS rushed him to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>Once EMS cleared out, investigators started their sweep of the apartment.</p>
<p>Right away, there was something they found rather odd.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed out of place.</p>
<p>No sign of a struggle.</p>
<p>Nothing appeared to be missing, and it seemed like the shooter hadn&rsquo;t left anything behind</p>
<p>other than the 10 spent shell casings, which were collected and eventually uploaded to</p>
<p>the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, or NIBIN.</p>
<p>The casings were two different calibers, which right away told police that they might be</p>
<p>looking for more than one suspect, but they were struggling to find anything else to collect</p>
<p>as evidence.</p>
<p>Detective Robert Chisholm with the Wichita Police Department responded to the scene that</p>
<p>he said that it was pretty clear right away that they would be strapped for evidence.</p>
<p>From what we can tell, they walked up, they shot him, they ran off.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t go through the house, didn&rsquo;t appear to have been searched, anything like that.</p>
<p>Once the casings were collected, investigators started the process of looking for any areas</p>
<p>that might have had the shooter&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>They searched dusted for fingerprints, swabbed all the doors and door handles, and any other</p>
<p>areas they felt like might have been touched by the shooter or shooters.</p>
<p>They searched for any shoe prints inside and outside his apartment, but their thorough</p>
<p>searches turned up nothing.</p>
<p>While they were searching every nook and cranny for something, anything to hang their hats</p>
<p>on, they got word that James had passed away in the hospital.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been pronounced dead not long after arriving.</p>
<p>At the same time, word of the crime was spreading like wildfire.</p>
<p>Friends and family started to gather outside of the apartment waiting to find out what</p>
<p>had happened to James.</p>
<p>Investigators eventually came out and told them what happened, and they asked everyone</p>
<p>to come down to the station for interviews.</p>
<p>Several of the people agreed to interviews, including some of James&rsquo; family members,</p>
<p>even his kid&rsquo;s babysitter.</p>
<p>But possibly most importantly, James&rsquo; girlfriend and the mother of his six-week-old daughter</p>
<p>Valen Burrell agreed to be interviewed as well.</p>
<p>A reporting team spoke with Valen for this episode, and she said that when police were</p>
<p>questioning her, she honestly felt like a suspect, but she was willing to answer any</p>
<p>questions they had if it would help them catch James&rsquo; killer.</p>
<p>This whole time, like, my head is just spinning so fast because we have a six-week-old baby</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll never get to, I&rsquo;m thinking, you know, she&rsquo;ll never get to touch her dad, she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never get to see her dad, she&rsquo;ll never get to smell her dad, she&rsquo;ll never have her own</p>
<p>dad and she&rsquo;s only six weeks old.</p>
<p>James had five other kids by other women, and Valen was worried for them too.</p>
<p>One of his kids was a newborn who was literally just hours old.</p>
<p>Two of James&rsquo; kids lived with him, but they were thankfully at their grandma&rsquo;s house that</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>And as Valen sat there at the police station, she couldn&rsquo;t help but think of those six kids</p>
<p>who were now fatherless.</p>
<p>But Valen pushed through her tears and answered police&rsquo;s questions, the first being how she</p>
<p>had found out that something had happened to James.</p>
<p>She told investigators that she was sleeping soundly that morning, finally getting some</p>
<p>rest after a long weekend of celebrating her birthday.</p>
<p>But at some point, she woke up, and before drifting back to sleep, she decided to do</p>
<p>a quick scroll through Facebook.</p>
<p>Still half asleep, Valen thought that she saw a post with a picture of James&rsquo; apartment</p>
<p>and what looked like his car parked out front.</p>
<p>It was a link to a news story posted by local ABC affiliate Cake News, so Valen clicked</p>
<p>on the story to get a closer look.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when her stomach dropped.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t even read the story, but she could see clearly now that it was James&rsquo; apartment</p>
<p>in the picture, and she knew right away that something terrible had happened.</p>
<p>Valen dropped everything, ran to her car, and drove to James&rsquo; place, still barefoot.</p>
<p>Investigators asked Valen if she knew of anyone who would want to hurt James, and what</p>
<p>she told police echoed what everyone else they interviewed had to say.</p>
<p>There were some people who had it out for him.</p>
<p>Everyone pointed the finger at the same family, the McPhersons.</p>
<p>It was well known that the McPhersons held a longstanding grudge against James because</p>
<p>they blamed him for the death of one of their family members in 2017, Maya McPherson.</p>
<p>You see, at one point, Maya and James were a couple.</p>
<p>They lived together and had two kids.</p>
<p>But during their relationship, James was going through some turbulent times.</p>
<p>He was struggling with substance use disorder, and that led to some run-ins with the law</p>
<p>and ultimately jail time.</p>
<p>Now while he was locked up, Maya passed away from a drug overdose, which the McPherson</p>
<p>family blamed James for, claiming that he pressured her back into drugs after she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>gotten clean.</p>
<p>After her death, Maya&rsquo;s mom, who we&rsquo;re gonna call Wilma, got custody of their two</p>
<p>kids since James was still in jail, but once he got out, he regained custody.</p>
<p>Maya&rsquo;s family was far from happy about this, so the McPhersons took James to court and</p>
<p>fought for custody, but ultimately, the judge sided with James.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like Maya&rsquo;s family was totally cut off.</p>
<p>The end arrangement was that James got custody of the kids throughout the week, and Wilma</p>
<p>would take them on the weekend.</p>
<p>The McPhersons weren&rsquo;t happy about that.</p>
<p>At the time of James&rsquo;s death, Wilma was in the process of taking James to court again.</p>
<p>I mean, things were messy, and some of Maya&rsquo;s relatives had even gone as far as making death</p>
<p>threats toward James.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just verbal threats.</p>
<p>Police learned that earlier that very week, James and one of Maya&rsquo;s male relatives got</p>
<p>into a physical altercation.</p>
<p>Detective Chisholm wasn&rsquo;t under the impression that the fight was too violent.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t reported to police, and to his knowledge, nobody needed medical attention.</p>
<p>But any kind of fight like this before someone dies is something that&rsquo;s really gonna stick</p>
<p>out in hindsight, right?</p>
<p>And there was something else police learned about the McPherson family that really raised</p>
<p>some eyebrows.</p>
<p>Another one of Maya&rsquo;s male relatives, who&rsquo;d also been pretty vocal about his feelings</p>
<p>toward James, had just finished serving a prison sentence for domestic battery.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been released from prison just a matter of hours before James was killed.</p>
<p>Investigators knew that they needed to track this guy down, but not before they finished</p>
<p>interviewing everybody else who came to the station.</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s family and friends said aside from the issues with Maya&rsquo;s family, James&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life had been quiet recently.</p>
<p>After Maya died in 2017, James was determined to turn his life around for the sake of his</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>He got clean, got a well-paying job at a meatpacking plant in Wichita, and he never looked back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d recently gotten his first apartment and was doing his best to provide for his</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>Sure, he had struggled with substance use in the past, but that was all behind him.</p>
<p>He was moving forward.</p>
<p>He had the biggest heart of anybody that I knew, and he would give you his absolute last</p>
<p>without even thinking about it, without question.</p>
<p>He was very dependable.</p>
<p>He was a very, very, very great dad, and nothing was more important in this world than his</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>But as they interviewed more people, it became clear that the McPherson&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t moving</p>
<p>forward.</p>
<p>At least based on what the police heard from the kid&rsquo;s babysitter, who we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>call Tanya.</p>
<p>Tanya actually did some housekeeping stuff for James on the side, and she was there the</p>
<p>day that James was killed.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been there doing some dishes and some other light housekeeping while he was at work,</p>
<p>and she said that while she was working, two men stopped by the apartment.</p>
<p>They were Maya&rsquo;s relatives, and they were looking for cigarettes.</p>
<p>Now Tanya said that this wasn&rsquo;t exactly abnormal.</p>
<p>I guess people often came over to James&rsquo;s apartment to get some cigarettes from her</p>
<p>because she was known in the area as this kind of go-to person for that.</p>
<p>But just in case those two guys were somehow connected to James&rsquo;s murder, Tanya gave police</p>
<p>their names.</p>
<p>While detectives were conducting these interviews, officers were canvassing James&rsquo;s neighborhood,</p>
<p>hoping that someone had seen something and was willing to talk.</p>
<p>But as they knocked on door after door, their hopes were dashed.</p>
<p>No one had seen anyone or anything suspicious that night.</p>
<p>Only one neighbor even reported hearing anything.</p>
<p>They said that they heard gunshots at around 2 a.m., then a woman screaming at around 3,</p>
<p>which police figure was Tara discovering James.</p>
<p>But the canvass did uncover something helpful.</p>
<p>A house across the street from James&rsquo;s apartment had a few surveillance cameras, and that really</p>
<p>gave detectives something to work with.</p>
<p>You can actually see the footage in the blog post for this episode on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>At 2 10 a.m., the camera caught a sedan slowly driving down the street beside James&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>Then it parked on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Seconds later, at 2 12 a.m., two people are seen getting out of the car.</p>
<p>They walk out of frame in the direction of James&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>And then 40 seconds later, they are seen running away from James&rsquo;s apartment, darting toward</p>
<p>their car.</p>
<p>I mean, they are booking it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to miss them in the footage because they&rsquo;re running so fast that they just look</p>
<p>like blurs across the screen.</p>
<p>Seconds after you see those blurs, you see the car&rsquo;s taillights pop on, but not the</p>
<p>headlights.</p>
<p>And the car peels out of its parking spot, then drive to the intersection, turns left</p>
<p>and continues out of frame.</p>
<p>Now, even though we&rsquo;re talking about a case from 2020, we are somehow still dealing with</p>
<p>really crappy footage.</p>
<p>The quality itself is pretty low.</p>
<p>And coupled with the fact that the stretch of road isn&rsquo;t well lit, it is so difficult</p>
<p>to make out honestly anything about these people, gender, race, clothing, and it was</p>
<p>even harder to know what kind of car they were driving.</p>
<p>But investigators found another surveillance camera further down the street.</p>
<p>And using that, they were able to grab a high quality image of the car that they were looking</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>A light colored Chevy sedan, possibly an Impala or a Malibu.</p>
<p>Aside from giving police a car description, this footage told them three other important</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>One, it confirmed what they had already suspected.</p>
<p>There were two shooters.</p>
<p>Two, thanks to the timestamps on the camera, they knew the exact time that the attack had</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>And most disturbingly of all, was number three.</p>
<p>The whole ambush took less than a minute, only 40 seconds.</p>
<p>To police, this meant that the killers had one intention that night, to kill James.</p>
<p>It was a calculated hit job, but by whom?</p>
<p>In the days following James&rsquo;s murder, police tracked down the three relatives of Maya&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who were brought up in their initial interviews.</p>
<p>Police contacted the two guys who came by that day to get cigarettes, but only one of</p>
<p>them was willing to talk to investigators.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t super cooperative with the questioning, but he denied any involvement in James&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>I can always think, you know, I mean, it sounds reasonable to me that they were there for</p>
<p>something more than just cigarettes.</p>
<p>But once again, as far as what I can prove and move forward with at this point, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any reason to say that they weren&rsquo;t just there to visit and get cigarettes.</p>
<p>So investigators moved on to Maya&rsquo;s other relatives that they wanted to track down.</p>
<p>Specifically, the one who&rsquo;d been released from prison just hours before James was found</p>
<p>dead in his bedroom.</p>
<p>But that guy wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate with an interview either.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t so much as provide an alibi.</p>
<p>He was completely closed-lipped.</p>
<p>And this was a frustrating pattern with many of Maya&rsquo;s family members.</p>
<p>The male relatives on the McPherson side were non-cooperative.</p>
<p>We interviewed a number of them.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t very cooperative at all.</p>
<p>As the days and weeks passed by, the tips slowed down and hope that James&rsquo;s killer</p>
<p>would be caught faded.</p>
<p>They had almost no physical evidence to work with, and the people they needed to talk to</p>
<p>were refusing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Things were at a standstill.</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s case seemed to go cold and his family was left to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s sister, Danielle Winston, said losing her brother left a hole in her life that she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be able to fill.</p>
<p>Because he was more than just her brother.</p>
<p>He was her best friend.</p>
<p>They had different mothers and were only three months apart, so they grew up telling everyone</p>
<p>that they were twins.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d watched him go through a lot of struggles throughout his life, but she also had a front-row</p>
<p>seat to him overcoming those.</p>
<p>He was just becoming a man.</p>
<p>He was immature for a lot of his life.</p>
<p>Life wasn&rsquo;t important until it came to what had to be important.</p>
<p>A battle with his children, fighting for custody of his kids after his wife had passed.</p>
<p>He succeeded.</p>
<p>He won that battle.</p>
<p>He got himself a job, a good job, $20 an hour job.</p>
<p>He got his first apartment.</p>
<p>He was doing everything right leading up to his death.</p>
<p>Not a gang member, not a violent person, a funny lovable drunk, but funny and lovable.</p>
<p>Danielle said that her brother was an incredible poet.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like to share his poems much, but would often give them to her, and she keeps</p>
<p>a poem that he wrote about her proudly displayed in her living room.</p>
<p>It almost sounds cliche to say that my brother didn&rsquo;t have a bad bone in his body because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s my brother.</p>
<p>You can ask a million people, I swear they&rsquo;re all going to say the same.</p>
<p>That boy walked in, and there was just a light.</p>
<p>It was a light inside of him that was dim for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>He was literally at the peak of greatness, of doing great things, of these kids never</p>
<p>wanting for anything.</p>
<p>It clicked.</p>
<p>It finally happened.</p>
<p>Forget the streets and interests about these kids, Team Winston, Team Winston, Team Winston.</p>
<p>He was definitely at his peak of becoming the man that he was supposed to be.</p>
<p>And I was taken from him.</p>
<p>Valen also got to witness James becoming his best self.</p>
<p>One of her favorite memories of him was an interaction at the supermarket that happened</p>
<p>just a few months before his passing.</p>
<p>I was trying to teach him how to budget his money.</p>
<p>And we went into Walmart, and he was just so excited.</p>
<p>He was so excited about everything.</p>
<p>He was so excited that he was going to learn how to budget his money.</p>
<p>So I said, OK, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get groceries with $40.</p>
<p>You can get a couple meals with that.</p>
<p>This was way before inflation.</p>
<p>But we go in Walmart, and we&rsquo;re on the second aisle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK, you don&rsquo;t need a list.</p>
<p>You just need to know what you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little kid on the aisle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s screaming.</p>
<p>And his mom said, I don&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough money for that.</p>
<p>We just have enough money to get the things we came for.</p>
<p>James only had $40 and gave the kid 20 bucks.</p>
<p>So I was like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And he was like, he wants a toy.</p>
<p>His mom can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>And he was like, he&rsquo;s crying.</p>
<p>But he just loved people.</p>
<p>He loved kids.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t want to see anybody hurting.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to see anybody suffering.</p>
<p>Memories like that are what James&rsquo;s family clung to</p>
<p>as they grieved the loss of a giant in their lives</p>
<p>and came to grips with the fact that his killer might never</p>
<p>be caught.</p>
<p>For months, the investigation was stagnant.</p>
<p>But in June 2020, there was finally</p>
<p>a development in the case.</p>
<p>Investigators got a hit in the NIBIN.</p>
<p>Some of the casings found in James&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>matched some bullets found at another scene</p>
<p>of another murder.</p>
<p>The other murder happened in Kansas City, Missouri</p>
<p>on June 6.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about four months after James was killed.</p>
<p>There was a big outdoor gathering</p>
<p>and a huge fight broke out.</p>
<p>Lots of shots were fired.</p>
<p>And one man was killed.</p>
<p>His name was Montel Ridley.</p>
<p>Investigators in James&rsquo;s case did some digging,</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t find any connection</p>
<p>between Montel and James besides the bullets</p>
<p>that they were killed with.</p>
<p>The two victims didn&rsquo;t seem to know each other</p>
<p>and detectives weren&rsquo;t aware of any strong connections</p>
<p>any of their suspects had to Kansas City.</p>
<p>But the two cities are only about a three-hour drive apart.</p>
<p>So it could have been anyone on their suspect list</p>
<p>or the gun could have been a street gun</p>
<p>that found its way to Missouri.</p>
<p>This lead didn&rsquo;t give detectives much information,</p>
<p>but they wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait much longer</p>
<p>for another development,</p>
<p>one that would give them a lot more to work with.</p>
<p>A month later in July, police got another NIBIN hit.</p>
<p>This time it was because one of the murder weapons</p>
<p>had been recovered in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d been a carjacking that led to a big police chase</p>
<p>and ended with the suspect wrecking a stolen car.</p>
<p>Now the suspect bailed and the police weren&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to catch him or positively identify him,</p>
<p>but inside the stolen car, they found a gun,</p>
<p>which they took into evidence.</p>
<p>And as was protocol, they test fired the gun</p>
<p>and uploaded the casings to NIBIN</p>
<p>to see if there were any matches to other crimes.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, there were two.</p>
<p>With all of this information,</p>
<p>investigators were able to track the gun</p>
<p>back to the original purchaser,</p>
<p>a woman from Wichita who we&rsquo;re gonna call Stacy.</p>
<p>As far as Detective Chisholm knows,</p>
<p>Stacy didn&rsquo;t know James or any of the suspects in his case,</p>
<p>but she was known to associate with a rough crowd.</p>
<p>Through some digging, police learned that she herself</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a criminal record</p>
<p>and she actually did purchase the gun legally.</p>
<p>Detective Chisholm reached out to Stacy,</p>
<p>explained the situation to her and asked her</p>
<p>if he could just ask her some questions.</p>
<p>No, originally she acted as if she wanted to cooperate,</p>
<p>but it was, you know, very,</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t answering questions</p>
<p>and then she was going to get back to me.</p>
<p>She had to look at something</p>
<p>and she had to check her paperwork</p>
<p>or she wanted to do this or she wanted to do that</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d call me back.</p>
<p>Of course, she doesn&rsquo;t call back.</p>
<p>I call her again after multiple attempts,</p>
<p>go to her house, multiple attempts to make contact.</p>
<p>She does call me,</p>
<p>but then doesn&rsquo;t provide any more information,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t wanna talk to me, hangs up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been our relationship, you might say.</p>
<p>She is not what I would call cooperative.</p>
<p>Detective Chisholm said it&rsquo;s frustrating</p>
<p>that she won&rsquo;t talk because he thinks</p>
<p>that she may hold the information</p>
<p>they need to close the case.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t have enough probable cause</p>
<p>to execute a search warrant for her house</p>
<p>or charge her with any kind of crime.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just not being cooperative.</p>
<p>And that lack of cooperation</p>
<p>when dealing with local law enforcement</p>
<p>in and of itself does not constitute a crime.</p>
<p>Right now, I can&rsquo;t tell you if the gun was stolen from her,</p>
<p>if it was borrowed by somebody,</p>
<p>if it was sold to somebody,</p>
<p>or if even she&rsquo;s a suspect.</p>
<p>Because once again, in the videos,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell race, sex, gender of the persons involved.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have any other information right now</p>
<p>that would lead me to know or connect her</p>
<p>to either one of these young men who were killed.</p>
<p>Since those NIBIN hits,</p>
<p>there has been little movement in James&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But Detective Chisholm hasn&rsquo;t given up the fight.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still trying to track down</p>
<p>some of Maya&rsquo;s relatives for questioning.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s also looking out for anyone with a vehicle</p>
<p>similar to the one that killed her.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also looking out for anyone with a vehicle</p>
<p>similar to the one caught on surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very difficult to get past</p>
<p>that James&rsquo;s life was so centered at that moment.</p>
<p>I mean, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of external noise in his life.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s been two years</p>
<p>since the last big development in this case,</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s loved ones haven&rsquo;t given up hope.</p>
<p>Valen told us she thinks it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</p>
<p>before James&rsquo;s killers are caught.</p>
<p>The thing that I know about people</p>
<p>is that relationships change.</p>
<p>So the people who you think</p>
<p>are gonna keep your secret forever will not.</p>
<p>We asked her what she would say</p>
<p>to the person who took James&rsquo;s life if she got the chance.</p>
<p>I would just let them know that they took away</p>
<p>a very, very, very beautiful soul from this earth.</p>
<p>They put out a light and a very bright soul.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t fair and it wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>And he still had so much life to live.</p>
<p>And he still had kids to raise and kids to be a part of</p>
<p>and memories to make with his kids</p>
<p>and birthday parties to celebrate.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not gonna get to do that anymore.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because you guys were selfish or you got mad</p>
<p>or you decided to use a gun instead of your mouth</p>
<p>to have a conversation.</p>
<p>And at some point in time,</p>
<p>we gotta put the guns down and start talking.</p>
<p>For James&rsquo;s family and friends, it&rsquo;s been excruciating</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to move on</p>
<p>without their sweet, loving, goofy James.</p>
<p>When they took little James two years ago,</p>
<p>they definitely took half of me.</p>
<p>And I have not been able to recover.</p>
<p>So many different emotions as a sister losing a brother</p>
<p>is no greater or no less than a mother, a wife,</p>
<p>a girlfriend, a baby mama, a niece, a nephew.</p>
<p>Pain is pain and I carry it heavily.</p>
<p>My life will never be the same.</p>
<p>It will never go back to being normal.</p>
<p>There is no more normal.</p>
<p>This is the new normal.</p>
<p>Your brother&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>So you as a human, how could you function in society</p>
<p>when you know that someone murdered somebody close to you</p>
<p>that was close to them?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that make you think</p>
<p>that maybe they were close to me too?</p>
<p>Do I know my brother&rsquo;s murderer?</p>
<p>Do they sit on my couch with me?</p>
<p>Do they come to family functions?</p>
<p>Do we bump each other in the club?</p>
<p>Do y&rsquo;all want to talk to me and hug me?</p>
<p>James&rsquo; family has gone two long years without answers.</p>
<p>His six children are having to grow up without their father</p>
<p>and the monsters who took his life</p>
<p>are still roaming the streets.</p>
<p>James&rsquo; loved ones deserve answers</p>
<p>and James deserves justice.</p>
