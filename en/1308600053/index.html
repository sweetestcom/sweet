    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair,</p>
<p>professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center</p>
<p>for the Biology of Aging.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair&rsquo;s work is focused on why we age</p>
<p>and how to slow or reverse the effects of aging</p>
<p>by focusing on the cellular and molecular pathways</p>
<p>that exist in all cells of the body</p>
<p>and that progress those cells over time</p>
<p>from young cells to old cells.</p>
<p>By elucidating the biology of cellular maturation and aging,</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair&rsquo;s group has figured out intervention points</p>
<p>by which any of us, indeed all of us,</p>
<p>can slow or reverse the effects of aging.</p>
<p>What is unique about his work</p>
<p>is that it focuses on behavioral interventions,</p>
<p>nutritional interventions,</p>
<p>as well as supplementation</p>
<p>and prescription drug interventions</p>
<p>that can help us all age more slowly</p>
<p>and reverse the effects of aging in all tissues of the body.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair holds a unique and revolutionary view</p>
<p>of the aging process,</p>
<p>which is that aging is not the normal</p>
<p>and natural consequence that we all will suffer,</p>
<p>but rather that aging is a disease</p>
<p>that can be slowed or halted.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair continually publishes</p>
<p>original research articles</p>
<p>in the most prestigious and competitive scientific journals.</p>
<p>In addition to that, he&rsquo;s published a popular book</p>
<p>that was a New York Times bestseller.</p>
<p>The title of that book is</p>
<p>A Lifespan, Why We Age and Why We Don&rsquo;t Have To.</p>
<p>He is also very active in public facing efforts</p>
<p>to educate people on the biology of aging</p>
<p>and slowing the aging process.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinclair and I share a mutual interest and excitement</p>
<p>in public education about science.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m thrilled to share with you that we&rsquo;ve partnered</p>
<p>and Dr. David Sinclair is going to be launching</p>
<p>the Lifespan podcast,</p>
<p>which is all about the biology of aging</p>
<p>and tools to intervene in the aging process.</p>
<p>That podcast will launch Wednesday, January 5th.</p>
<p>You can find it at the link in the show notes</p>
<p>to this episode today,</p>
<p>as well, you can subscribe to that podcast on YouTube,</p>
<p>Apple, or Spotify, or anywhere that you get your podcasts.</p>
<p>Again, the Lifespan podcast featuring Dr. David Sinclair</p>
<p>begins Wednesday, January 5th, 2022.</p>
<p>Be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a tremendous amount of information</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to learn both the mechanistic science</p>
<p>behind aging, the mechanistic science</p>
<p>behind reversing the aging process and practical tools</p>
<p>that you can apply in your everyday life.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s episode, Dr. Sinclair and I talk about</p>
<p>the biology of aging and tools to intervene in that process.</p>
<p>And so you might view today&rsquo;s episode as a primer</p>
<p>for the Lifespan podcast,</p>
<p>because we delve deep into the behavioral tools,</p>
<p>the nutritional aspects, supplementation aspects</p>
<p>of the biology of aging.</p>
<p>We also talk about David&rsquo;s important discoveries</p>
<p>of the sirtuins, particular molecular components</p>
<p>that influence what is called the epigenome.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know what the epigenome is,</p>
<p>you will soon learn in today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>Coming away from today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have in-depth knowledge about the biology of aging</p>
<p>at the cellular, molecular,</p>
<p>and what we call the circuit level,</p>
<p>meaning how the different organs and tissues of the bodies</p>
<p>age independently and how they influence</p>
<p>the aging of each other.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode gets into discussion</p>
<p>about many aspects of aging and tools to combat aging</p>
<p>that have not been discussed on any other podcast</p>
<p>or in the book Lifespan.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now, my conversation with Dr. David Sinclair.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to see you.</p>
<p>This is mate, by the way, that we&rsquo;re toasting at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Unlike other podcasts, we, well, I don&rsquo;t drink alcohol,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m boring that way.</p>
<p>But truly, thanks for being here.</p>
<p>I have a ton of questions for you.</p>
<p>We go way back in some sense,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t have many, many questions</p>
<p>about aging longevity, lifespan, actionable protocols</p>
<p>to increase how long we live, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I just want to start off with a very simple question</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not even sure there&rsquo;s an answer to,</p>
<p>but what is the difference between longevity,</p>
<p>anti-aging, and aging as a disease?</p>
<p>Because I associate you with the statement,</p>
<p>aging is a disease.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, so longevity is the more academic way</p>
<p>we describe what we research.</p>
<p>Anti-aging is kind of the same thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got a bad rap because it&rsquo;s been used</p>
<p>by a whole bunch of people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So I really don&rsquo;t like that term anti-aging.</p>
<p>But aging as a disease and longevity</p>
<p>are perfectly valid ways to talk about this subject.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about aging as a disease.</p>
<p>When I started my research,</p>
<p>disease here at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>it was considered, if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrong with you and it&rsquo;s a rare thing,</p>
<p>has to be less than 50% of the population,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely a disease.</p>
<p>And then people work their whole lives</p>
<p>to try and cure that condition.</p>
<p>And so I looked up what&rsquo;s the definition of aging.</p>
<p>And it says, well, it&rsquo;s a deterioration</p>
<p>in health and sickness, and you can die from it.</p>
<p>Typically you do.</p>
<p>Something that sounds pretty much like a disease,</p>
<p>but the caveat is that if more than half the population</p>
<p>gets this condition, aging,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s put in a different bucket,</p>
<p>which is, first of all, that&rsquo;s outrageous</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a totally arbitrary cutoff.</p>
<p>But think about this,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re ignoring the major cause of all these diseases.</p>
<p>Aging is 80 to 90% the cause of heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t get old and our bodies stayed youthful,</p>
<p>we would not get those diseases.</p>
<p>And actually what we&rsquo;re showing in my lab</p>
<p>is if you turn the clock back in tissues,</p>
<p>those diseases go away.</p>
<p>So aging is the problem.</p>
<p>And instead, through most of the last 200 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been sticking Band-Aids on diseases</p>
<p>that have already occurred because of aging,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is we want to slow aging down</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t get those diseases.</p>
<p>And when they do occur, don&rsquo;t just stick a Band-Aid on,</p>
<p>reverse the age of the body,</p>
<p>and then the diseases will go away.</p>
<p>That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.</p>
<p>Can we point to one specific general phenomenon</p>
<p>in the body that underlies aging?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s contentious</p>
<p>because scientists like to come up with new hypotheses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how they build their careers.</p>
<p>But fortunately, during the 2000s,</p>
<p>we settled on eight or nine major causes of aging.</p>
<p>We call them hallmarks</p>
<p>because causes was a little bit too strong.</p>
<p>But these eight or nine causes,</p>
<p>at least for the first time,</p>
<p>allowed us to come around and talk together.</p>
<p>We put them on a pizza</p>
<p>so everyone got an equal weighting, equal slices.</p>
<p>And before that, by the way,</p>
<p>we were trying to kill each other in the field.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>Interesting that you guys work on aging</p>
<p>and trying to kill each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Well, kill each other&rsquo;s careers.</p>
<p>I mean, I like to think I was fairly generous,</p>
<p>but I was one of the kids,</p>
<p>and the old guard really didn&rsquo;t like the new guard.</p>
<p>We just came along in the 1990s and 90s</p>
<p>and said, free radicals don&rsquo;t do much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually genes called longevity genes,</p>
<p>and that caused a whole ruckus.</p>
<p>And there was this competition for what never happened,</p>
<p>which was a Nobel Prize for this.</p>
<p>And it just led to a lot of competition.</p>
<p>I would go to meetings and people would shout at each other</p>
<p>and just backstab.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>But then fortunately in the 2000s,</p>
<p>we rallied around this new map of aging</p>
<p>with these causes or hallmarks.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s one slice of the pizza</p>
<p>that is way larger than the others.</p>
<p>And we can get to that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the information in the cell</p>
<p>that we call the epigenome.</p>
<p>Well, tell us a little bit more about the epigenome.</p>
<p>Frame it for us, if you will,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get into ways</p>
<p>that one can adjust the epigenome in positive ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a reductionist, is to boil it down.</p>
<p>And I actually ended up boiling aging down to an equation,</p>
<p>which is the loss of information due to entropy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard thing to overcome</p>
<p>the second law of thermodynamics, that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>But this equation really represents the fact</p>
<p>that I think aging is a loss of information</p>
<p>in the same way that when you Xerox something a thousand</p>
<p>times, you&rsquo;ll lose that information,</p>
<p>or you try to copy a cassette tape,</p>
<p>or even if you send information across the internet,</p>
<p>some of it will get lost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think is aging.</p>
<p>And there are two types of information in the body.</p>
<p>There is the genetic information, which is digital,</p>
<p>A, T, C, G, the chemical letters of DNA.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this other part of the information in the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just as important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential, in fact, and that&rsquo;s the systems</p>
<p>that control which genes are switched on and off,</p>
<p>in what cell, at what time,</p>
<p>in response to what we eat, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it turns out that 80% of our future longevity</p>
<p>and health is controlled by this second part,</p>
<p>the epigenetic information, the control systems.</p>
<p>I liken the DNA to the music that&rsquo;s on a DVD</p>
<p>or a compact disc for the younger people.</p>
<p>We used to use these things.</p>
<p>I recall, yeah.</p>
<p>And then the epigenome is the reader that says,</p>
<p>okay, in this cell, we need to play that set of songs.</p>
<p>And in this other cell,</p>
<p>we have to play a different set of songs.</p>
<p>But over time, aging is the equivalent of scratching</p>
<p>the CD and the DVD so that you&rsquo;re not playing</p>
<p>the right songs.</p>
<p>And cells, when they don&rsquo;t hear the right songs,</p>
<p>they get messed up and they don&rsquo;t function well.</p>
<p>And that is what I&rsquo;m saying is the main driver of aging.</p>
<p>And these other hallmarks are largely manifestations</p>
<p>of that process.</p>
<p>Can we go a little deeper into what these scratches are?</p>
<p>Is it the way that the DNA are packed into a cell?</p>
<p>Is it the way that they&rsquo;re spaced?</p>
<p>What are the scratches that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>So DNA is six foot long.</p>
<p>If you join your chromosomes together,</p>
<p>you get a six foot per cell.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s enough to go to the moon</p>
<p>and back eight times in your body.</p>
<p>And it has to be wrapped up to exist inside us.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just wrapped up willy-nilly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a bundle of string.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrapped up very carefully in ways that dictates</p>
<p>which genes are switched on and off.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re developing in the embryo,</p>
<p>the cell marks the DNA with chemicals that says,</p>
<p>okay, this gene is for a nerve cell.</p>
<p>You, you cell will stay a nerve cell</p>
<p>for the next hundred years, if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t turn into a skin cell, that would be bad.</p>
<p>And those chemicals,</p>
<p>there are many different types of chemicals,</p>
<p>but one&rsquo;s called methylation.</p>
<p>Those little methyls will mark which songs get played</p>
<p>for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And there are other marks that change daily.</p>
<p>But in total, what we&rsquo;re saying is that</p>
<p>the body controls the genome</p>
<p>through the ability to mark the DNA</p>
<p>and then compact some parts of it,</p>
<p>silence those genes, don&rsquo;t read those genes,</p>
<p>and open others, keep others open that should stay open.</p>
<p>And that pattern of genes that are silent and open,</p>
<p>silent, open, is what dictates the cell&rsquo;s type,</p>
<p>the cell&rsquo;s function.</p>
<p>And then the scratches are the disruption of that.</p>
<p>So genes that were once silent,</p>
<p>and you could say it&rsquo;s a gene that is involved in skin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s starting to come on in the brain, shouldn&rsquo;t be there,</p>
<p>but we see this happen, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The gene might get shut off over time during aging.</p>
<p>Cells over time lose these structures,</p>
<p>lose their identity, they forget what they&rsquo;re supposed to do,</p>
<p>and we get diseases.</p>
<p>We call that aging.</p>
<p>And we can measure that.</p>
<p>In fact, we can measure it in such a way</p>
<p>that we can predict when somebody&rsquo;s going to die</p>
<p>based on the changes in those chemicals.</p>
<p>Are these changes the same sorts of changes</p>
<p>that underlie the outward body surface manifestations</p>
<p>of aging that most of us are familiar with?</p>
<p>Graying of the hair, wrinkling of the skin,</p>
<p>drooping of the face.</p>
<p>Walking around New York lately, it&rsquo;s amazing to me,</p>
<p>there are certain people that seem to walk</p>
<p>looking down at the sidewalk</p>
<p>because their spine is essentially in a C-shape, right?</p>
<p>A hallmark, if you will, of aging</p>
<p>that most of us are familiar with.</p>
<p>Are these same sorts of DNA scratches associated with that,</p>
<p>or are we talking about people that potentially</p>
<p>are going to look older, but simply live longer?</p>
<p>You are as old as you look, if you want to generalize.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with centenarian families.</p>
<p>These are families that tend to live over 100.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re 70, they still look 50 or less.</p>
<p>So it is a good indicator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect because you can, like me,</p>
<p>grow up in Australia</p>
<p>and accelerate the aging of your skin,</p>
<p>but in general, how you look.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s ever died from gray hair,</p>
<p>but overall, you can get a sense</p>
<p>just from the ability of skin to hold itself up,</p>
<p>how thin it is, the number of wrinkles.</p>
<p>That is actually, a great paper just came out</p>
<p>that said that an AI system looking at the face</p>
<p>could very accurately predict someone&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>So I started off in developmental neurobiology.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I learned early on</p>
<p>that I still believe wholeheartedly</p>
<p>is that development doesn&rsquo;t stop at age 12 or 15,</p>
<p>or even 25, that your entire life</p>
<p>is one long developmental arc.</p>
<p>So in thinking about different portions</p>
<p>of that developmental arc,</p>
<p>the early portion of infancy, and especially puberty,</p>
<p>seem like especially rapid stages of aging.</p>
<p>And I know we normally look at babies and children</p>
<p>and kids in puberty, and we think,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re so vital, they&rsquo;re so young.</p>
<p>And yet, the way you describe these changes in the epigenome</p>
<p>and the way you have framed aging as a disease</p>
<p>leads me to ask, are periods of immense vitality</p>
<p>the same periods when we&rsquo;re aging faster?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and this is something I&rsquo;ve never talked about,</p>
<p>at least not publicly.</p>
<p>So this is a really good question.</p>
<p>So those chemicals we can measure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also known as the Horvath clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the biological clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s separate from your chronological age.</p>
<p>So actually, what I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>is that when the AI looked at the faces of those people,</p>
<p>they could predict their biological age, their internal age.</p>
<p>So your skin represents the age of your organs as well.</p>
<p>And the people that look after themselves,</p>
<p>we can talk about how to do that later,</p>
<p>but there are some people that are 10, 20 years younger</p>
<p>than other people biologically.</p>
<p>And it turns out if you measure that clock from birth</p>
<p>or even before birth, if you look at animals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a massive increase in age</p>
<p>based on that clock early in life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really important point</p>
<p>that you have accelerated aging</p>
<p>during the first few years of life,</p>
<p>and then it goes linear towards the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another interesting thing you brought up,</p>
<p>which is that we&rsquo;re finding that the genes</p>
<p>that get messed up, that get scratched,</p>
<p>that are leading to aging</p>
<p>are those early developmental genes.</p>
<p>They come on late in life and just mess up the system.</p>
<p>And they seem to be particularly susceptible</p>
<p>to those scratches.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s causing the scratches?</p>
<p>Well, we know of a couple of things in my lab,</p>
<p>we figured out.</p>
<p>One is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,</p>
<p>particularly cuts to the DNA breaks.</p>
<p>So if you have an X-ray or a cosmic ray,</p>
<p>or even if you go out in the sun</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get your broken chromosomes,</p>
<p>that accelerates the unwinding</p>
<p>of those beautiful DNA loops that I mentioned.</p>
<p>We can actually do this to a mouse.</p>
<p>We can accelerate that process</p>
<p>and we get an old mouse, 50% older,</p>
<p>and it has this bent spine, kyphosis,</p>
<p>it has gray hair, its organs are old.</p>
<p>So we now can control aging in the forwards direction.</p>
<p>The other thing that accelerates aging</p>
<p>is massive cell damage or stress.</p>
<p>So we pinched nerves and we saw that their aging process</p>
<p>was accelerated as well.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is more of an anecdotal phenomenon.</p>
<p>It is an anecdotal phenomenon,</p>
<p>but this experience of in junior high school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going home for a summer and you come back,</p>
<p>high school in the US usually starts eighth or ninth grade</p>
<p>or grade eight or grade nine for you Canadians.</p>
<p>And then some of the kids,</p>
<p>like they grew beards over the summer</p>
<p>or they completely matured quickly over the summer.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any reason to believe</p>
<p>that rates of entry into and through puberty</p>
<p>can predict overall rates of aging?</p>
<p>In other words, if a kid is a slow burner, right?</p>
<p>They basically acquire the traits of puberty</p>
<p>slowly over many years.</p>
<p>Can we make some course prediction</p>
<p>that they are going to live a long time</p>
<p>versus a kid that goes home for the summer</p>
<p>and comes back a completely different organism</p>
<p>or appearing to be a completely different organism?</p>
<p>Like they basically age very quickly in the summer.</p>
<p>Does that mean they&rsquo;re aging very quickly overall?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to scare anybody.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There are studies that show</p>
<p>that the slower you take to develop,</p>
<p>it also is predictive of having a longer, healthier life.</p>
<p>And it may have something to do with growth hormone.</p>
<p>We know that growth hormone is pro-aging.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s taking growth hormone, pay attention.</p>
<p>We know that- Just look at someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taking growth hormone.</p>
<p>Yeah. They often won&rsquo;t acquire</p>
<p>these characteristics of vitality,</p>
<p>like improved smoothness of skin,</p>
<p>but their whole body shape changes often.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you&rsquo;ll feel better for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll build up muscle, you feel great,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like burning your candle at both ends.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you want to live longer,</p>
<p>you want less of that.</p>
<p>And the animals that have been generated</p>
<p>and mutants that have low growth hormone,</p>
<p>sometimes these are dwarfs, they live the longest by far.</p>
<p>A guy in my lab, Michael Bonkowski,</p>
<p>he had the longest lived mouse.</p>
<p>A mouse typically lives about two and a bit years.</p>
<p>He had a mouse that lived five years</p>
<p>and he gave it caloric restrictions for fasting</p>
<p>combined with one of these dwarf mutations,</p>
<p>low growth hormone.</p>
<p>I think he called it Yoda.</p>
<p>But this is, you know, you look at who lives the longest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the really small people.</p>
<p>This is a bit anecdotal,</p>
<p>but it sounds like it might be true,</p>
<p>is that the people who played the munchkins</p>
<p>in the Wizard of Oz,</p>
<p>many of them went on to live into their nineties</p>
<p>and beyond.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And oh, there are some Laron dwarfs as well.</p>
<p>There are dwarf mutations in South America</p>
<p>and they seem to be protected</p>
<p>against many of the diseases of aging.</p>
<p>You barely ever see heart disease</p>
<p>or cancer in these families.</p>
<p>So I, having owned a very large dog breed,</p>
<p>a bulldog Mastiff,</p>
<p>who lived a long life for a bulldog, 11 years,</p>
<p>but there are many dogs that will live 12, 16 years</p>
<p>that are smaller dogs.</p>
<p>Can we say that there&rsquo;s a direct relationship</p>
<p>between body size and longevity or duration of life?</p>
<p>Well, there is,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re a slave</p>
<p>to your early epigenome nor to your genome.</p>
<p>The good news is that the epigenome can change.</p>
<p>Those loops and structures can be modified</p>
<p>by how you live your life.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re born tall and I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I wished at the time I did grow,</p>
<p>but no matter what size you are,</p>
<p>you can have a bigger impact on your life</p>
<p>than anything your genes give you.</p>
<p>80% is epigenetic, not genetic.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some of the things that people can do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of batched these into categories</p>
<p>rather than just diving right into actionable protocols.</p>
<p>So the first one relates to food, blood sugar, insulin.</p>
<p>This is something I hear a lot about</p>
<p>that fasting is good for us,</p>
<p>but rarely do I hear why it&rsquo;s good for us.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&rsquo;m excited to talk to you today</p>
<p>is because I want to drill into the details of this</p>
<p>because I think understanding the mechanism</p>
<p>will allow people to make better choices</p>
<p>and not simply to just decide</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re going to fast or not fast</p>
<p>or how long they&rsquo;re going to fast,</p>
<p>I think should be dictated</p>
<p>by some understanding of the mechanism.</p>
<p>So why is it that having elevated blood sugar,</p>
<p>glucose and insulin ages us more quickly?</p>
<p>And or why is it that having periods of time each day</p>
<p>or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start with what I think was a big mistake</p>
<p>was the idea that people should never be hungry.</p>
<p>We live in a world now</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s at least three meals a day</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve got companies selling bars</p>
<p>and snacks in between.</p>
<p>So the feeling of hunger,</p>
<p>some people never experience hunger in their whole lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really bad for them.</p>
<p>It was based, I believe, on the 20th century view</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to stress out the pancreas</p>
<p>and you try to keep insulin levels pretty steady</p>
<p>and not have this fluctuation.</p>
<p>What we actually found, my colleagues and I,</p>
<p>across this field of longevity</p>
<p>is that when you look at, first of all, animals,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a dog or a mouse or a monkey,</p>
<p>the ones that live the longest, by far, 30% longer</p>
<p>and stay healthy are the ones that don&rsquo;t eat all the time.</p>
<p>Actually, it was first discovered</p>
<p>back in the early 20th century, but people ignored it.</p>
<p>And then it was rediscovered in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Clive McKay did caloric restriction.</p>
<p>He put cellulose in the food of rats</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t get as many calories even though they ate.</p>
<p>And those rats lived 30% longer.</p>
<p>But then it went away.</p>
<p>And then it came back in the 2000s in a big way</p>
<p>when a couple of things happened.</p>
<p>One is that my lab and others showed</p>
<p>that there are longevity genes in the body</p>
<p>that come on and protect us from aging and disease.</p>
<p>The group of genes that I work on are called sirtuins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s seven of them.</p>
<p>And we showed in 2005 in a science paper</p>
<p>that if you have low levels of insulin</p>
<p>and another molecule called insulin-like growth factor,</p>
<p>those low levels turn on the longevity genes.</p>
<p>One of them that&rsquo;s really important is called SIRT1.</p>
<p>But by having high levels of insulin all day,</p>
<p>being fed means your longevity genes are not switched on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re falling apart, your epigenome,</p>
<p>your information that keeps your cells functioning</p>
<p>over time just degrades quicker.</p>
<p>Your clock is ticking faster by always being fed.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think might be happening</p>
<p>by always having food around</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not allowing the cell</p>
<p>to have periods of rest and reestablish the epigenome.</p>
<p>And so it also is accelerating in that direction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of other reasons as well</p>
<p>that are not as profound,</p>
<p>such as having low levels of glucose in your body</p>
<p>will trigger your major muscles in your brain</p>
<p>to become more sensitive to insulin</p>
<p>and suck the glucose out of your bloodstream,</p>
<p>which is very good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to have glucose flowing around too much.</p>
<p>And that will ward off type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>So hunger, of course, is associated with low blood glucose</p>
<p>and low insulin.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s anything about the subjective experience</p>
<p>of hunger itself that could be beneficial for longevity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>Though you get used to the feeling of not eating.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of screwed that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cold water.</p>
<p>You eventually adapt.</p>
<p>You get used to it, unfortunately.</p>
<p>But there are some studies that are being done</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>that are able to simulate the effect of hunger,</p>
<p>but still provide the calories.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking like there&rsquo;s a small component</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s due to hunger.</p>
<p>But most of it actually is because you&rsquo;ve got these periods</p>
<p>of not being fed,</p>
<p>and then the body turns on these defensive genes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really interesting experiment</p>
<p>that was published maybe a couple of years ago</p>
<p>by Rafael de Cabo down at the NIH.</p>
<p>What he did was he took over 10,000 mice</p>
<p>and gave them different combinations</p>
<p>of fat, carbohydrate, protein.</p>
<p>And he was trying to figure out</p>
<p>what was the best combination.</p>
<p>And then he also cleverly had a group,</p>
<p>well, two groups, one that was fed all the time,</p>
<p>or ate as much as they wanted.</p>
<p>And the other group was only given food for an hour a day.</p>
<p>And it turns out they ate roughly</p>
<p>the same amount of calories.</p>
<p>Because of course, in an hour,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stuffing their faces.</p>
<p>It turns out it didn&rsquo;t matter what diet he gave them.</p>
<p>It was only the group that ate within that window</p>
<p>that lived longer and dramatically longer.</p>
<p>So my conclusion is,</p>
<p>and mice are very similar to us metabolically,</p>
<p>I think that tells us that it&rsquo;s not as important</p>
<p>what you eat, it&rsquo;s when you eat during the day.</p>
<p>What is the protocol that people can extrapolate from that?</p>
<p>Or maybe I should just ask you,</p>
<p>what is your protocol for when to eat</p>
<p>and when to avoid food?</p>
<p>Do you ever fast longer than 24 hours?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>And what do you think is a good jumping off place</p>
<p>if people want to explore this as a protocol?</p>
<p>Well, if there&rsquo;s one thing I could say,</p>
<p>if I would say definitely try to skip a meal a day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>Does it matter which meal?</p>
<p>Or are they essentially equivalent?</p>
<p>Well, as long as it&rsquo;s at the end</p>
<p>or the beginning of the day,</p>
<p>because then you add that to the sleep period</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re hopefully not eating.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an excellent point.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s a simple one,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s an excellent one</p>
<p>because I think one of the things</p>
<p>that people struggle with the most</p>
<p>is knowing when and how to initiate</p>
<p>this so-called intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>And the middle of the day, obviously,</p>
<p>is not tacked to the sleep cycle in the same way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much harder as well for many people.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do.</p>
<p>I skip breakfast.</p>
<p>I have a tiny bit of yogurt or olive oil</p>
<p>because the supplements I have need to be dissolved in it.</p>
<p>And then I go throughout the whole day</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m doing right now here with this glass of water here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just keeping myself filled with liquids.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t feel hungry.</p>
<p>Be aware that the first two to three weeks</p>
<p>when you try that, you will feel hungry.</p>
<p>And you also have a habit of wanting to chew on something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of physical parts to it.</p>
<p>But try to make it through the first three weeks</p>
<p>and do without breakfast or do without dinner.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get through it.</p>
<p>And I did that for most of my life, actually,</p>
<p>mainly because I wasn&rsquo;t hungry in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people are very hungry in the morning</p>
<p>and they may want to consider skipping dinner instead.</p>
<p>But I will go throughout the whole day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the crashes of the high glucose</p>
<p>and the low glucose.</p>
<p>Anyone who goes, oh, man, it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need a sleep.</p>
<p>If you do what I do, you will not experience that anymore.</p>
<p>Because what my body does is it regulates</p>
<p>blood sugar levels naturally.</p>
<p>My liver is putting out glucose when it needs to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very steady and gives me pure focus</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even have to think about lunch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just powering through.</p>
<p>At dinner, I love food as much as anybody.</p>
<p>I will eat a regular, pretty healthy meal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to eat mostly vegetables.</p>
<p>I can eat some fish, some shrimp.</p>
<p>I rarely will eat a steak.</p>
<p>In fact, my microbiome is so adapted to my diet.</p>
<p>Now, if I eat a steak, it will not get digested very well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel terrible.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t eat a steak, I feel terrible.</p>
<p>Argentine lineage, but we can talk about that</p>
<p>some other time.</p>
<p>Well, everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>What works for me may not be perfect for you.</p>
<p>And we do have to measure things to know what&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>I rarely eat dessert.</p>
<p>I gave up dessert and sugar when I turned 40.</p>
<p>And occasionally I&rsquo;ll steal a bit of dessert</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t hurt if you steal it, right?</p>
<p>But other than that, I avoid sugar,</p>
<p>which includes simple carbohydrates,</p>
<p>bread I try to avoid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually noticed, this is just a side note.</p>
<p>I used to get buildup of plaque pretty easily.</p>
<p>And every time I went to the dentist,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d have to scrape it off.</p>
<p>And I even bought tools to scrape it off</p>
<p>because it was driving me nuts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get plaque anymore.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because of my diet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have those sugars in my mouth</p>
<p>that the bacteria feed on</p>
<p>and then form the biofilm on the teeth.</p>
<p>Much better breath, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a benefit.</p>
<p>So do you ever fast longer than this?</p>
<p>It sounds like if you go to bed,</p>
<p>well, you tend to stay up late, I know,</p>
<p>because I get texts from you at like two in the morning.</p>
<p>My time, which means you&rsquo;re out very late</p>
<p>and up early as well.</p>
<p>But assuming that people go to sleep</p>
<p>sometime around 11.30 or 12, plus or minus an hour,</p>
<p>and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>plus or minus 90 minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating more or less on a,</p>
<p>it sounds like some 20 hours of fasting,</p>
<p>four hours of eating, or 16 hours of fasting,</p>
<p>and eight hours of food intake, et cetera.</p>
<p>But do you ever do longer fasts,</p>
<p>like 48 hours or 72 hours, a week-long fast?</p>
<p>Occasionally, I do.</p>
<p>So my typical day, I would only eat within a two-hour window</p>
<p>just usually I&rsquo;m either eating out or-</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re 22, too?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but I love, well-</p>
<p>And if you exercise, do you feel like</p>
<p>then you just power through and maintain that fasted state?</p>
<p>Absolutely, I can exercise,</p>
<p>and now my body&rsquo;s so used to it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I need food after exercising.</p>
<p>I used to, and, but have I gone longer?</p>
<p>Yes, but not very often.</p>
<p>I find it quite difficult to go more than 24 hours.</p>
<p>But when I do it, maybe it&rsquo;s once a month,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go for two days.</p>
<p>After two, and actually even better,</p>
<p>if you go for three days without eating,</p>
<p>it kicks in even greater longevity benefits.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a system called the autophagy system,</p>
<p>which digests old and misfolded proteins in the body.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a natural cleansing</p>
<p>that happens when you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>Macroautophagy, its name is.</p>
<p>But a good friend of mine,</p>
<p>Anna Maria Cuovo at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,</p>
<p>discovered a deep cleanse</p>
<p>called the chaperone-mediated autophagy,</p>
<p>which kicks in day two, day three,</p>
<p>which really gets rid of the deep proteins.</p>
<p>And what excites me is she just put out a big paper</p>
<p>that said, if you trigger this process in an old mouse,</p>
<p>it lives 35% longer.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>If I could go longer, I would,</p>
<p>but I just find that with my lifestyle</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going always day 110%,</p>
<p>I need to eat at least once a day, unfortunately.</p>
<p>One more practical question</p>
<p>than a mechanistic question related to this.</p>
<p>The practical question is,</p>
<p>when you are fasting, regardless of how long,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re ingesting fluids like water</p>
<p>and presumably some caffeine.</p>
<p>I heard you had several or more espresso today,</p>
<p>which is impressive.</p>
<p>But are you also ingesting electrolytes?</p>
<p>I know some people get lightheaded,</p>
<p>they start to feel shaky when they fast,</p>
<p>and that the addition of sodium to their water</p>
<p>or potassium, magnesium is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s becoming a little more in vogue now.</p>
<p>Is that something that you do</p>
<p>or that you see a need for people to do?</p>
<p>Well, it makes sense, but I haven&rsquo;t had a need to do it,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I drink tea during the day and coffee when I&rsquo;m first awake</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get the shakes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fix what&rsquo;s not broken.</p>
<p>And I do add things to my protocol</p>
<p>that I think will improve me</p>
<p>and avoid those things, of course, that won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But yeah, because I don&rsquo;t have a need for it, I don&rsquo;t try it</p>
<p>but it does make sense,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;ve had a big night the night before,</p>
<p>you probably want to supplement with that.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a fair amount of good stuff</p>
<p>in tea and coffee as it is.</p>
<p>Okay, so then the mechanistic question is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve told us that there&rsquo;s ample evidence</p>
<p>that keeping your blood sugar low</p>
<p>for a period of time, each 24 hours,</p>
<p>can help trigger some of these pro-longevity,</p>
<p>anti-aging mechanisms,</p>
<p>and that extending them out two or three days</p>
<p>can trigger yet additional mechanisms</p>
<p>of gobbling up of dead cells and things of that sort.</p>
<p>How is it that blood glucose triggers these mechanisms?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve said, okay, remove glucose</p>
<p>and things get better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked before, maybe we could talk more now</p>
<p>about some of the underlying cellular</p>
<p>and genetic mechanisms, things like the sirtuins,</p>
<p>but how are glucose and the sirtuins</p>
<p>actually tethered to one another mechanistically?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>That proves you&rsquo;re a scientist, a world-leading one.</p>
<p>So what we now know is that these longevity pathways,</p>
<p>we call them, these longevity genes talk to each other.</p>
<p>And we used to say, oh, my longevity gene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more important than yours, it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re all talking to each other,</p>
<p>you pull one lever and the other one moves.</p>
<p>And the way to think of it is that there are systems</p>
<p>set up to detect what you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>So the sirtuins will mainly respond to sugar and insulin.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other system called mTOR,</p>
<p>which is sensing how much protein</p>
<p>or amino acids are coming into your body.</p>
<p>And they talk to each other.</p>
<p>We can pull one and affect the other and vice versa.</p>
<p>But together, when you&rsquo;re fasting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the sirtuin activation,</p>
<p>which is good for you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll also, through lack of amino acids,</p>
<p>particularly three of them, leucine, isoleucine, valine,</p>
<p>the body will down-regulate mTOR.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that up sirtuin, down mTOR</p>
<p>that is hugely beneficial and turns on</p>
<p>all of the body&rsquo;s defenses.</p>
<p>Chewing up the old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>giving us more energy, repairing cells, all of that.</p>
<p>And so these two pathways, I think,</p>
<p>are the most important for longevity.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>You mentioned leucine.</p>
<p>Within the resistance training</p>
<p>slash bodybuilding slash fitness community,</p>
<p>leucine gets a lot of attention</p>
<p>because there are longstanding debates</p>
<p>about how much protein one needs per day</p>
<p>and how much one can assimilate at each meal.</p>
<p>It makes for many YouTube videos and not much else, frankly.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s clear that because of leucine&rsquo;s effects</p>
<p>on the mTOR pathway, that there are many people,</p>
<p>not just people in these particular fitness communities,</p>
<p>that are actively trying to ingest more leucine</p>
<p>on a regular basis in order to maximize</p>
<p>their wellness and fitness, and in some cases,</p>
<p>muscle growth, but also just wellness.</p>
<p>But what I interpret your last statement to mean</p>
<p>is that leucine, because it triggers cellular growth,</p>
<p>is actually pro-aging in some sense.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Well, it could be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the evidence suggests.</p>
<p>And again, it goes back to the debate,</p>
<p>should you supplement with growth hormone or testosterone?</p>
<p>All of these activities will give you immediate benefits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll bulk up more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel better immediately.</p>
<p>But based on the research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at the expense of long-term health.</p>
<p>So my view of longevity, the way I treat my body,</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t burn both candles.</p>
<p>I have one end of the candle lit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very careful, I don&rsquo;t blow on it.</p>
<p>But I also do enough exercise</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m building up my muscle, but I&rsquo;m not huge.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s seen me knows</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not a professional bodybuilder.</p>
<p>But I try to actually, here&rsquo;s the key,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t said this publicly that I can remember,</p>
<p>I pulse things so that I get periods of fasting,</p>
<p>and then I eat, then I take a supplement,</p>
<p>then I fast, then I exercise,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking the supplements and eating</p>
<p>in the right timing to allow me</p>
<p>to build up muscle sometimes.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t just expect to take something constantly</p>
<p>and do something constantly for it to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s taken me about 15 years</p>
<p>to develop my protocol.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of subtlety to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like a very rational protocol.</p>
<p>Does the name Ori Hoffmeckler mean anything to you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, just briefly, I discovered Ori Hoffmeckler</p>
<p>about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>He was in Israeli Special Forces.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now got to be close to 70.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Ori, if that number is inflated.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called The Warrior Diet,</p>
<p>which got very little attention at the time.</p>
<p>But what he said was,</p>
<p>when he was in Israeli Special Forces,</p>
<p>they rarely ate more than once per day,</p>
<p>and sometimes once every second or third day.</p>
<p>And this is a guy who maintains</p>
<p>an incredible physical stature.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very lean, very strong, and very vital.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say an advanced age,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s getting up there,</p>
<p>and he just seems to be getting better and better.</p>
<p>Ori Hoffmeckler was the person</p>
<p>who essentially founded, if you will,</p>
<p>although our ancestors founded, to be completely fair,</p>
<p>the so-called intermittent fasting diet.</p>
<p>He called it The Warrior Diet,</p>
<p>and this book didn&rsquo;t get much attention.</p>
<p>But one of the things that you just said</p>
<p>really reminded me of Ori.</p>
<p>I sat down with him.</p>
<p>I actually went to his home and sat down with him,</p>
<p>and he said, fasting is wonderful,</p>
<p>but these pulses where you nourish the body,</p>
<p>or even slightly over-nourish the body,</p>
<p>provided they aren&rsquo;t too frequent,</p>
<p>have a tremendous effect on vitality.</p>
<p>And so I want to use that as kind of a segue</p>
<p>to address this issue of vitality versus longevity.</p>
<p>Because here, you&rsquo;re telling me,</p>
<p>and certainly the evidence supports,</p>
<p>that growth hormone will make you feel better and younger,</p>
<p>taking testosterone, or estrogen, we should probably say.</p>
<p>There are women who take hormone therapies later in life</p>
<p>who take estrogen.</p>
<p>They experience a strong increase in vitality</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s done correctly.</p>
<p>But there is an effect of aging the body more rapidly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a second puberty, if you will.</p>
<p>But this idea of restriction and then pulsing,</p>
<p>not necessarily feast and famine,</p>
<p>but certainly famine and feast in lowercase letters,</p>
<p>there really seems to be something about that.</p>
<p>So at a cellular level,</p>
<p>like we kind of go back to mTOR and the sirtuins,</p>
<p>how do you think that the cells might be reacting</p>
<p>to this kind of lowercase feast</p>
<p>and uppercase famine type protocol?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, the pulsing, I think,</p>
<p>is what you want to do is to get the cells</p>
<p>to be perceiving adversity, okay?</p>
<p>Because our modern life, we&rsquo;re sitting around,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re eating too much, we&rsquo;re not exercising.</p>
<p>Our cells respond.</p>
<p>They go, hey, everything&rsquo;s cool, no problem.</p>
<p>And they become relaxed,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t turn on their defenses,</p>
<p>and we age rapidly.</p>
<p>We can see it in the clock.</p>
<p>People who exercise and eat less</p>
<p>have a slower ticking clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>But my protocol is different than most people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because I am pulsing it.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, let&rsquo;s get to</p>
<p>why did I even think that might be possible?</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t read the warrior diet.</p>
<p>What I found in my research was that</p>
<p>if we gave resveratrol, this red wine molecule</p>
<p>that became well-known in the 2000s,</p>
<p>if we gave it to mice their whole lifespan,</p>
<p>they were protected against a high-fat diet,</p>
<p>which we call the Western diet.</p>
<p>They had lean organs.</p>
<p>They lived slightly longer, but not a lot.</p>
<p>And if we gave them a high-fat diet without resveratrol,</p>
<p>they actually lived a lot shorter.</p>
<p>So resveratrol protected them against the high-fat diet.</p>
<p>We gave it to them on a normal diet.</p>
<p>They just ate it when they wanted,</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t much effect.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s not known,</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s in the supplemental data of the paper</p>
<p>that nobody ever reads.</p>
<p>The mice that were given resveratrol every second day</p>
<p>on a normal diet lived dramatically longer</p>
<p>than any other group.</p>
<p>So people out there, my critics say,</p>
<p>our resveratrol didn&rsquo;t extend the lifespan</p>
<p>of mice on a normal diet.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s not aging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just protecting against a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>Well, look at the supplemental data, please.</p>
<p>If you give it to the mice every other day,</p>
<p>we had mice living over three years.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>I have got many, many mice in my ownership</p>
<p>at my lab at Stanford,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a very long life for a mouse.</p>
<p>It was, by far.</p>
<p>And so it was a long lifespan extension.</p>
<p>And what that told me is that probably</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be taking a supplement every day.</p>
<p>You can take it either every other day</p>
<p>or give your body a rest.</p>
<p>And I do the same with my meals.</p>
<p>I rest during the day,</p>
<p>and then I give a nutritious dinner to my body</p>
<p>and then give it a rest.</p>
<p>Same with exercise.</p>
<p>And then I try to time it,</p>
<p>because there are times when I&rsquo;m taking the drug metformin,</p>
<p>which mimics low energy.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>metformin is a drug given to type 2 diabetics</p>
<p>to bring down their blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been found that,</p>
<p>looking at tens of thousands of veterans and others,</p>
<p>that those two type 2 diabetics live longer</p>
<p>than people that don&rsquo;t even get type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a longevity drug.</p>
<p>Right now, you have to get it from your doctor in the US.</p>
<p>In most other countries,</p>
<p>you can just get it over the counter.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re protected, it looks like,</p>
<p>based on epidemiological data.</p>
<p>Cancer, heart disease, frailty.</p>
<p>Um, what else?</p>
<p>Dementia.</p>
<p>So I take metformin.</p>
<p>In addition, you take metformin</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fasting each day.</p>
<p>So when do you take it relative to the fasting?</p>
<p>Yeah, I always take metformin in the morning,</p>
<p>along with the resveratrol,</p>
<p>because, for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>but mainly because my body responds better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been measuring my body for 12, 13 years.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to exercise that day,</p>
<p>I will skip the metformin.</p>
<p>And a lot of people who do pay attention</p>
<p>to this kind of thing</p>
<p>think that they should stop taking metformin</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re never going to get muscle</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to affect their ability to build up muscle.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>What metformin does to you,</p>
<p>it actually just reduces your ability to have stamina</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s inhibiting your body&rsquo;s ability to make energy.</p>
<p>And so what happens is, when you&rsquo;re on metformin,</p>
<p>you do fewer reps.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>Those muscles that you do build up on metformin</p>
<p>have the same strength</p>
<p>and have much lower inflammation and other markers of aging.</p>
<p>You just won&rsquo;t have that extra 5% size of muscles.</p>
<p>So if you want large muscles, don&rsquo;t take metformin,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be fine during your exercise.</p>
<p>But for me, I&rsquo;m not trying to get giant.</p>
<p>I want strong muscles</p>
<p>and I want to live longer and healthier.</p>
<p>So I just try to time it</p>
<p>so that I get the most reps out of my exercise regime.</p>
<p>But sometimes in scientific literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth bringing this up.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a 5% difference in a graph,</p>
<p>then either the press release or some reporter will say,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, big difference, 5%,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take metformin during exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the headline.</p>
<p>And then you go in and it&rsquo;s barely significant.</p>
<p>And the graph is distorted</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve changed the axes to make it look bigger.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s become a myth</p>
<p>that metformin greatly inhibits your ability to exercise,</p>
<p>which is not true.</p>
<p>But in an abundance of caution,</p>
<p>I skip my metformin on days I&rsquo;m going to exercise.</p>
<p>And not only that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the 20% of people</p>
<p>that has a stomach sensitivity to it.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m not feeling great that day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take it either.</p>
<p>You mentioned metformin is available</p>
<p>only by prescription from a doctor, at least in the US.</p>
<p>Berberine, this is a substance that comes from tree bark,</p>
<p>who I also learned about many years ago from Ori.</p>
<p>He said, if ever I&rsquo;m going to overeat</p>
<p>like a Thanksgiving meal or something, I take berberine.</p>
<p>Those were his words.</p>
<p>And I tried it.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable about berberine</p>
<p>is that you can eat enormous quantities of food</p>
<p>and not feel as if you&rsquo;ve eaten enormous quantities of food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily recommending people do this.</p>
<p>But what I noticed was if I took berberine,</p>
<p>which my understanding is it works very similarly</p>
<p>to metformin, works on the AMPK pathway,</p>
<p>the mTOR pathway, et cetera,</p>
<p>that if I didn&rsquo;t ingest food, in particular carbohydrates,</p>
<p>I would feel a little dizzy and kind of get a headache,</p>
<p>like almost hypoglycemic.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on berberine</p>
<p>as an alternative to metformin?</p>
<p>And are there any cautionary notes?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously people should talk to their doctor</p>
<p>before adding or subtracting anything from their life,</p>
<p>including breathwork or anything that comes up.</p>
<p>But with all that set aside,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about berberine</p>
<p>and timing of low blood sugar and these sorts of things?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, before I had access to metformin,</p>
<p>I was taking berberine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often known as the poor man&rsquo;s metformin.</p>
<p>He just called me poor.</p>
<p>Women can take it too.</p>
<p>So the thing with berberine, and we&rsquo;ve studied it in my lab,</p>
<p>it is effective at boosting energetics in the body,</p>
<p>just like AMPK and metformin does.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve actually given it to rats and mice</p>
<p>and seen that they are very healthy,</p>
<p>especially on a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s likely to be good.</p>
<p>There are some human studies that exist,</p>
<p>clinical trials showing that it increases</p>
<p>insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>You have to take high doses.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think when people hear insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>sometimes people think, oh, well, that&rsquo;s bad, right?</p>
<p>No, but you want your cells to be insulin sensitive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a lot of blood sugar floating around</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be sequestered into cells.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So this is anti-type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>And so this berberine does have wonderful effects</p>
<p>on the metabolism of animals and in some clinical trials</p>
<p>on dozens of people it&rsquo;s been tested.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s one cautionary tale which just came up.</p>
<p>Matt Kaberlein&rsquo;s lab published that berberine</p>
<p>reduced the lifespan of worms.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure worms trump human clinical trials</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>So I would say-</p>
<p>Not in my opinion.</p>
<p>No disrespect to my C. elegans colleagues</p>
<p>or rather my colleagues that work on C. elegans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what I like to do is to give all the information</p>
<p>people can decide what they want.</p>
<p>But I would say if based on the worm data,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t panic just yet.</p>
<p>I think berberine has been shown to be really safe in humans.</p>
<p>You mentioned resveratrol.</p>
<p>I think now would be a great time to talk a little bit</p>
<p>about protocols for resveratrol,</p>
<p>grapeseed extract, et cetera.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the obvious one that I know you get a lot,</p>
<p>but for the record,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t I just drink red wine</p>
<p>and get enough resveratrol, David?</p>
<p>You can try.</p>
<p>You need to drink about 200 glasses a day.</p>
<p>So I-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s been tried.</p>
<p>There are some.</p>
<p>And I drink a glass of red wine a day if I get the chance.</p>
<p>But any more than that, it&rsquo;s a lot of calories</p>
<p>and your liver will get fatty and it&rsquo;s all bad.</p>
<p>So realistically, you can only get the thousand milligrams</p>
<p>that I take a day from a supplement that&rsquo;s pure.</p>
<p>Now there are a lot of people selling resveratrol.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not light gray or white in color, throw it away.</p>
<p>The brown stuff has gone bad or is contaminated.</p>
<p>And the contaminated stuff, beware, it&rsquo;ll cause diarrhea.</p>
<p>But regular resveratrol should not do that.</p>
<p>So a thousand milligrams per day is what you do?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I have for about 15 years now.</p>
<p>And you ingest that with some fatty substance</p>
<p>like olive oil or yogurt, is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to.</p>
<p>And other supplements, quercetin, curcumin,</p>
<p>these are crunchy things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to get through your gut.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just making this up.</p>
<p>I always base my statements on human studies.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of studies on resveratrol</p>
<p>as of others since.</p>
<p>And we know that from, we found out early,</p>
<p>I was one of the first people</p>
<p>to take a high dose resveratrol.</p>
<p>And when we included it with food,</p>
<p>the levels in my blood went up fivefold.</p>
<p>And so you want to have something in there.</p>
<p>If you just drink it with water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to get through.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, some people have done clinical trials</p>
<p>without even thinking that they might need</p>
<p>to dissolve it in something.</p>
<p>So are you taking this all at once in the morning</p>
<p>and chasing it with some olive oil?</p>
<p>Or are you dissolving it in yogurt?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the specific protocol?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been improving, perfecting what I do.</p>
<p>For about 10 years, I would take some Greek yogurt,</p>
<p>couple of spoonfuls, put the resveratrol on there,</p>
<p>mix it around, make sure it&rsquo;s dissolved</p>
<p>and put that in my mouth and swallow that.</p>
<p>These days, what I like to do,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve realized that olive oil</p>
<p>and particularly oleic acid,</p>
<p>one of the monounsaturated fatty acids,</p>
<p>is also an activator of the sirtuin defenses.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to ingest more of oleic acid.</p>
<p>So I switched to olive oil.</p>
<p>What I do is I put a couple of teaspoons of olive oil</p>
<p>in a glass, mix around the resveratrol</p>
<p>and maybe some quercetin, a similar molecule,</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s dissolved.</p>
<p>I put a little bit of vinegar.</p>
<p>And if I have a basil leaf, I&rsquo;ll put that in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like drinking some salad dressing and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Delicious.</p>
<p>That raises a question that I want to ask</p>
<p>before we get to NMN and NR and vitamin B3,</p>
<p>which is, by doing that,</p>
<p>do you think that it breaks your fast?</p>
<p>And I want to just frame this question</p>
<p>of breaking the fast in a more general scientific theme.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>One of the questions I get asked all the time is,</p>
<p>does ingesting blank break the fast?</p>
<p>Does eating this or drinking this, coffee,</p>
<p>if I walk in the room and someone else is eating a cracker,</p>
<p>does it break my fast?</p>
<p>People get pretty extreme with this.</p>
<p>My sense, and please tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but my sense is that it depends on the context</p>
<p>of what you did the night before,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re diabetic, lots of things.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I eat an enormous meal at midnight,</p>
<p>go to sleep, wake up at 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>I could imagine that black coffee</p>
<p>or coffee with a little bit of cream</p>
<p>might quote unquote break my fast,</p>
<p>but the body doesn&rsquo;t have a breaking the fast switch.</p>
<p>The body only speaks in the language of glucose,</p>
<p>AMPK, mTOR, et cetera.</p>
<p>So do you worry that ingesting these calories</p>
<p>is going to quote unquote break your fast?</p>
<p>And more generally, how do you think about the issue</p>
<p>of whether or not you&rsquo;re fasting enough</p>
<p>to get these positive effects?</p>
<p>Because not everybody can manage on just water or just tea,</p>
<p>or we should say not everybody is willing to manage</p>
<p>on just water or just tea for a certain part of the day.</p>
<p>Well, my first answer is not scientific, it&rsquo;s philosophical.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t enjoy life, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d like a cup of coffee in the morning,</p>
<p>little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt&rsquo;s not going to kill me.</p>
<p>Olive oil doesn&rsquo;t have protein or carbs in it, not many,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m probably not affecting</p>
<p>those longevity pathways negatively.</p>
<p>But without that, first of all,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy my life as much.</p>
<p>Well, the olive oil is not as great as the yogurt,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m trying to optimize,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no perfect solution to what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still learning.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s optimal for me,</p>
<p>let alone everybody else, but I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that taking a couple of spoonfuls</p>
<p>of something, unless it&rsquo;s high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>is going to hurt you, because I&rsquo;ve now got the rest</p>
<p>of the day till about eight, 9 p.m. of not eating anything,</p>
<p>and I forgive myself for that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really good point here.</p>
<p>You and I were discussing this earlier.</p>
<p>The point about doing this is that you try to do your best,</p>
<p>if you go from regular living to don&rsquo;t eat the whole day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to fail.</p>
<p>Like quitting smoking cold turkey,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to chew gum and stick the patch on,</p>
<p>because your body has to get used to all sorts of habits,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s social, it&rsquo;s physical,</p>
<p>putting stuff in your mouth,</p>
<p>chewing, not just the low blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>and your brain will fight it.</p>
<p>Your limbic system is going to go,</p>
<p>hey, do it, do it, do it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to have to fight it.</p>
<p>But once you get through it, you&rsquo;ll be better,</p>
<p>but you do it in stages.</p>
<p>Do breakfast first, then do small lunch,</p>
<p>and then eventually cut lunch out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go cold turkey, because everyone knows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fact that if you try to do a strict diet</p>
<p>right out of the gates, you&rsquo;ll almost always fail.</p>
<p>I think that captures the essence of fasting rationally</p>
<p>and a rational approach to supplementation very well.</p>
<p>Along the lines of supplementation,</p>
<p>what about NMN, NRNB3, niacin?</p>
<p>I want to know what you do.</p>
<p>I also want to know what I should do,</p>
<p>and I think most people want to know what they should do.</p>
<p>I mean, these are molecules</p>
<p>that impact the sirtuin pathway,</p>
<p>impact the pathways that control aging</p>
<p>or rates of aging in the epigenome.</p>
<p>How do they do that,</p>
<p>and how does one incorporate that</p>
<p>into a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>should they choose to do that?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, disclaimer is that I don&rsquo;t recommend anything,</p>
<p>but I talk about what I do.</p>
<p>So a bit of scientific background,</p>
<p>these sirtuin genes that we discovered,</p>
<p>first in yeast cells when I was at MIT,</p>
<p>and then in animals as I moved to Harvard in the 2000s.</p>
<p>And one of my first postdocs,</p>
<p>actually, literally my first postdoc, Haim Cohen,</p>
<p>published a great paper just a couple of months ago</p>
<p>and found that turning on the sirtuin-6 gene,</p>
<p>remember the seven, number six gene is very potent.</p>
<p>It extended the lifespan dramatically of mice</p>
<p>that he engineered, both males and females, which is great.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is,</p>
<p>so naturally boost the activity of these sirtuins.</p>
<p>They are genes, but they also make proteins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what genes typically make or encode.</p>
<p>And then those proteins take care of the body</p>
<p>in many different ways, as we&rsquo;ve discussed.</p>
<p>So how do you turn on these genes</p>
<p>and make the proteins they make even more active?</p>
<p>You want to rev up that system.</p>
<p>So exercise will do it.</p>
<p>Fasting will do it.</p>
<p>What about supplementation?</p>
<p>Well, the first activator of the sirtuins that we discovered</p>
<p>that acts on the enzyme to make it do a better job</p>
<p>of cleaning up the body and protecting was resveratrol.</p>
<p>We looked at thousands of different molecules,</p>
<p>eventually tens of thousands.</p>
<p>And the one that was the best was resveratrol in the dish.</p>
<p>And then we gave it to little organisms,</p>
<p>worms, and then flies and mice, eventually humans.</p>
<p>And we saw that it activated that enzyme.</p>
<p>So resveratrol is one way to activate it.</p>
<p>You can think of it as the accelerator pedal on a car.</p>
<p>It revs it up.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something else that the sirtuins need to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s NAD.</p>
<p>NAD is a really small molecule,</p>
<p>little chemical in the body that we need for life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used by the body for chemical reactions,</p>
<p>400 different reactions in the body.</p>
<p>And without it, you&rsquo;re dead within seconds.</p>
<p>You need NAD.</p>
<p>The problem that we&rsquo;ve seen is that NAD levels</p>
<p>decline as you become obese, as you get older,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t ever get hungry.</p>
<p>And the body not only doesn&rsquo;t make enough of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chewing it up as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enzyme called CD38</p>
<p>that Eric Verdin over at UCSF showed chews up.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s now at the Buck Institute in California.</p>
<p>Chews up NAD as you get older.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a double whammy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make as much, you chew it up,</p>
<p>which is really bad because what we&rsquo;ve shown in my lab</p>
<p>and so of others is that NAD levels are really important</p>
<p>for keeping those sirtuin defenses at a youthful level.</p>
<p>And you can give a lot of resveratrol,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have the fuel,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically accelerating a car</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have enough gas.</p>
<p>So you want to do both.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I take a precursor to NAD called NMN,</p>
<p>and the body uses that to make the NAD molecule in one step.</p>
<p>And so I know from measuring dozens of human beings</p>
<p>that if you take NMN for the time period that I do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking it for years,</p>
<p>but if you take it for about two weeks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll double, on average,</p>
<p>double your NAD levels in the blood.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s not public information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from clinical trials that are not yet published</p>
<p>over the last two years.</p>
<p>There are other ways to increase NAD levels</p>
<p>in someone like me who&rsquo;s getting older, I&rsquo;m 52 now.</p>
<p>You can take NR, which is used to make NMN,</p>
<p>which is used to make NAD.</p>
<p>And both NMN and NR are sold by companies in the US.</p>
<p>NR lacks the phosphate.</p>
<p>Phosphate&rsquo;s a small chemical the body needs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the atom phosphorus.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back one step.</p>
<p>How do you make NR?</p>
<p>NR gets made from vitamin B3, often.</p>
<p>You can also find it in milk and other foods.</p>
<p>But sometimes people ask me,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just take vitamin B3,</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t that just force the body to make NAD?</p>
<p>And the answer is no, it doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>We know this just by doing the experiment.</p>
<p>But the reason, I think, is that NAD is a,</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s a small molecule,</p>
<p>but relative to vitamin B3, it&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got those phosphates on there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the vitamin B attached.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got all these components</p>
<p>that come together to make this</p>
<p>very complicated little molecule called NAD.</p>
<p>And when you give NMN,</p>
<p>it contains all three components</p>
<p>that the body needs to make NAD.</p>
<p>If you give NR or just vitamin B3,</p>
<p>which is an even smaller molecule,</p>
<p>the body has to find these other components</p>
<p>from somewhere else.</p>
<p>So where do you get phosphate?</p>
<p>Well, body needs it for DNA, needs it for bones.</p>
<p>So high doses of something that requires additional phosphate</p>
<p>makes me a little concerned.</p>
<p>And we have compared NMN and NR head-to-head</p>
<p>in mouse studies.</p>
<p>For instance, NMN, we&rsquo;ve shown in a cell paper</p>
<p>a few years ago, makes mice run further.</p>
<p>Old mice can run 50% further</p>
<p>because they have better blood flow, better energy.</p>
<p>NR at the same dose did not do that.</p>
<p>In fact, it had no effect.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Dosage-wise, if I were elected to take NMN</p>
<p>in supplement form to increase my NAD levels</p>
<p>and presumably slow my aging,</p>
<p>how much NMN should I take?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the protocol that you do?</p>
<p>And are the various forms that are out there,</p>
<p>are some better or some worse?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m always happy to tell you what I do</p>
<p>and what my father does, my 82-year-old father.</p>
<p>We take a gram of NMN every day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a gram of resveratrol and a gram of NMN.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, a thousand milligrams.</p>
<p>Now, another important point,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m not the same as everybody else.</p>
<p>I have a different microbiome, age, sex, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been measuring myself.</p>
<p>And so I know if something&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>or I think I know if something&rsquo;s making me better or worse</p>
<p>based on measuring 45 different things.</p>
<p>So I just want people to be aware</p>
<p>that what I do may not perfectly work at all for others.</p>
<p>But I have studied, as I said,</p>
<p>dozens of people who take NMN at a gram,</p>
<p>sometimes two grams.</p>
<p>And I know by looking at all those people</p>
<p>that without any exceptions,</p>
<p>that if you do what I do,</p>
<p>your NAD levels go up by about twofold or more.</p>
<p>And so I do that every day, the thousand milligrams.</p>
<p>Now, people sell it.</p>
<p>Now, I never get into brands and all that.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t have the time to measure products.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Though I should say, I do want to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a solution for people to know what works</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s real and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I would say,</p>
<p>if you do want to buy this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you want to buy NMN,</p>
<p>look for a company that is well-established,</p>
<p>that has high levels of quality control.</p>
<p>Look for three letters, GMP,</p>
<p>which is good manufacturing practices.</p>
<p>And so that means they make it</p>
<p>under a certain level of quality control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to find iron filings in there.</p>
<p>And it probably has the stuff in it that they say it does.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s all I can say right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on something that&rsquo;s going to be much more helpful.</p>
<p>But overall, make sure it&rsquo;s white, crystalline, NMN.</p>
<p>And to me, it tastes like burnt popcorn.</p>
<p>You crack open the capsules</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll take a little sample</p>
<p>to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn.</p>
<p>Well, when I&rsquo;m making my capsules, I&rsquo;ll taste it.</p>
<p>And I do a lot of quality control on the stuff that I take.</p>
<p>Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol</p>
<p>or do you take it spread throughout the day?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all in the morning for those things.</p>
<p>So if I take metformin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s NMN and the resveratrol all together.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a good reason for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all scientific, I try to be.</p>
<p>The levels of NAD go up in the morning</p>
<p>in our bodies naturally.</p>
<p>Our bodies actually have a cycle of NAD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not steady.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s circadian?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s circadian.</p>
<p>In fact, NAD controls your clock.</p>
<p>This was shown by Shin, and my colleagues</p>
<p>in a nice science paper about a decade ago,</p>
<p>that if you disrupt the NAD cycle,</p>
<p>which is controlled by the sirtuin gene that we worked on,</p>
<p>that is what&rsquo;s telling your body,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s time to eat, it&rsquo;s time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>And if you take the NMN late at night, for example,</p>
<p>you can disrupt your circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely, when I travel and I want to reset my clock</p>
<p>to the time zone, I will take a boost of NMN in the morning</p>
<p>and I feel great.</p>
<p>Does this protocol for you,</p>
<p>does it produce any immediate effects</p>
<p>of increased energy, et cetera?</p>
<p>You mentioned that one would, if it&rsquo;s right for them,</p>
<p>would have to take it for at least two weeks</p>
<p>to start to see the NAD levels increase.</p>
<p>At that point, when NAD levels increase,</p>
<p>could one possibly expect an increase</p>
<p>in overall energy focus, et cetera?</p>
<p>I realize we&rsquo;re not making promises here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just wondering whether or not</p>
<p>the only measure of whether or not this protocol is working</p>
<p>is whether or not you die at age blank or blank plus 20.</p>
<p>And of course, once you&rsquo;re dead,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really know if you would have lived longer</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d done something differently and vice versa.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, there was a study, again, by Shin Amai,</p>
<p>my good friend at Washington University in St. Louis,</p>
<p>that showed that improves, remember,</p>
<p>this insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t know your insulin sensitivity</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re measuring a glucose,</p>
<p>have a glucose monitor on your arm.</p>
<p>Do you have one on right now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I used to.</p>
<p>I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, last time I saw you, you had this thing,</p>
<p>it looks like a small leech, not a large leech,</p>
<p>and it was measuring your blood glucose.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very informative</p>
<p>because you learn what your body reacts to,</p>
<p>and grapes were really bad.</p>
<p>Rhonda Patrick agrees with that.</p>
<p>But the issue was what?</p>
<p>Where were we, Andrew?</p>
<p>The issue is whether or not</p>
<p>you can expect any immediate effects</p>
<p>on energy, vitality, focus, just even subjective.</p>
<p>So what do you feel is the question?</p>
<p>And anecdotally,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been taking this for a long time,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t take it, I start to feel 50 years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think straight.</p>
<p>It may be placebo, but who knows?</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re doing now are very careful clinical trials.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done the safety for two years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re now treating elderly patients</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School with some wonderful colleagues.</p>
<p>And those people are actually going to be,</p>
<p>and are currently in MRIs,</p>
<p>so you can measure the energetics and the NAD levels</p>
<p>in their legs as they exercise in real time.</p>
<p>And that will tell us if what we see in the mice,</p>
<p>this increased endurance, actually works.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&rsquo;s fun to talk about anecdotes.</p>
<p>I have a number of athlete friends,</p>
<p>some of which have increased their,</p>
<p>lowered their time in marathons, for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good friend of ours in our circle</p>
<p>that is winning marathons at age 50 now.</p>
<p>And he attributes that to the protocol that he&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t started taking NMN,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m planning to do that when my next birthday arrives,</p>
<p>which is in a couple months.</p>
<p>But I do experiments on my sister and have for years.</p>
<p>I have a sister who&rsquo;s three years older than I am,</p>
<p>who is very enthusiastic about these protocols.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you that after reading your book,</p>
<p>I started purchasing for her</p>
<p>and giving her an NMN supplement.</p>
<p>And she claims, and I believe her,</p>
<p>she has a quite sensitive system</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s very tuned into it.</p>
<p>She feels far and away better when she takes it</p>
<p>as opposed to when she doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done the control experiment of removing her supply</p>
<p>and then giving it back to her and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my other laboratory.</p>
<p>This is what younger brothers do to older sisters.</p>
<p>I have a question about something</p>
<p>that if it has no relevance,</p>
<p>we can just treat it as a speed bump and then move right on.</p>
<p>The artificial sweeteners, these things that,</p>
<p>or I should say non-glucose increasing sweeteners.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got stevia, which is a plant basically,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got sucralose and aspartame</p>
<p>and all these things.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that I know we&rsquo;re both aware of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been published in quite reputable journals</p>
<p>showing that they can disrupt the gut microbiome</p>
<p>in certain cases, in particular saccharin,</p>
<p>the one that basically nobody uses anymore.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s questionable as to whether or not</p>
<p>stevia has the same negative effects, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this is about.</p>
<p>But in terms of the sensation of,</p>
<p>or the perception of sweet taste,</p>
<p>is that itself a possible detriment to these pro-longevity,</p>
<p>forgive me for using the term, the pathways?</p>
<p>You know, if I were to drink a diet Coke during a fast,</p>
<p>am I somehow disrupting this?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m asking this question</p>
<p>because I get asked this question a lot.</p>
<p>Well, there may be small effects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re worth worrying about.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan laughed at me because I was drinking a diet Coke</p>
<p>during the first interview I did with him.</p>
<p>I will drink diet Coke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the scientific literature.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s this 5% thing</p>
<p>that I think is blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>If I was to put a number on it,</p>
<p>I would say if eating a high sugary meal</p>
<p>or drinking a sugar filled soda,</p>
<p>what is that?</p>
<p>30 grams of sugar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s a 10 out of 10 bad for you.</p>
<p>A diet Coke might be a one.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m, you know, which am I going to do?</p>
<p>I could have a 10 or a one or go without in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do the one on occasion.</p>
<p>I try to avoid them</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the ones as much.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t say that Sucralose</p>
<p>is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no comparison.</p>
<p>And I think, what is it, Stevia.</p>
<p>I do use Stevia whenever I can</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a naturally sourced product.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t seen any good evidence yet</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s bad for you.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of this is overblown.</p>
<p>And a lot of it&rsquo;s the media</p>
<p>trying to give equal weight to stories.</p>
<p>As you know, as a scientist,</p>
<p>it can be frustrating when something&rsquo;s a 10</p>
<p>and something&rsquo;s a one and they&rsquo;re equated.</p>
<p>How do I say this respectfully?</p>
<p>I think if science journalists were required</p>
<p>to post their credentials alongside their name,</p>
<p>people would take the articles</p>
<p>with an additional grain of salt, right?</p>
<p>I mean, in other words,</p>
<p>that I think that the science media</p>
<p>is mainly generate around two specific goals.</p>
<p>One is to make people very, very afraid</p>
<p>or get people very, very excited.</p>
<p>And oftentimes the get people excited part</p>
<p>is sponsored content.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s overlooked.</p>
<p>In any case, thank you for that.</p>
<p>I want to talk about iron and iron load.</p>
<p>We were talking earlier about ferritin</p>
<p>and of course women menstruate.</p>
<p>And so their iron needs are greater</p>
<p>than people men that don&rsquo;t menstruate</p>
<p>or women that don&rsquo;t menstruate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can get right down</p>
<p>into how much iron somebody needs</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll vary person to person.</p>
<p>But I was surprised to learn that iron</p>
<p>is actually going to accelerate the aging process</p>
<p>in various contexts.</p>
<p>Well, this is a new finding out of Spain.</p>
<p>Manuel Serrano&rsquo;s lab has found</p>
<p>that excess iron will increase the number</p>
<p>of senescent cells in the body.</p>
<p>And senescent cells are the zombie cells</p>
<p>that accumulate as you get older</p>
<p>and they sit there and they cause inflammation mainly</p>
<p>and also can cause cancer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s found that if you get rid of these cells</p>
<p>or never accumulate them, you stay younger.</p>
<p>In animals and there&rsquo;s some really interesting studies</p>
<p>out of Mayo Clinic in humans as well.</p>
<p>So iron is a pro-senescent metal.</p>
<p>And so what I think is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking excess iron as a supplement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably accelerating your aging process.</p>
<p>The other thing that I found really interesting</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve looked at hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s metabolism and their blood biomarkers.</p>
<p>I was one of the first people in InsideTracker</p>
<p>as a board member and I&rsquo;m still their scientific lead guy.</p>
<p>So I can look anonymously</p>
<p>at hundreds of thousands of people&rsquo;s blood work.</p>
<p>And we also know how fit they are, how old they are.</p>
<p>Some of them are marathon runners, some of them are CrossFit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a signature of health</p>
<p>that actually is different than your average person.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to say bad things about MDs</p>
<p>because a lot of my best friends are MDs</p>
<p>and I work with them at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>The issue though, is that with MD training,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a scale of what&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re out of that normal range,</p>
<p>something must be wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the paradigm that they work under.</p>
<p>But first of all, everybody&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>and you want to know their baseline</p>
<p>and track people over years to know what&rsquo;s normal for them.</p>
<p>And what I find, for example,</p>
<p>is people who are really healthy and live the way I do</p>
<p>and have a diet that&rsquo;s fairly vegetarian, but not strict,</p>
<p>still have slightly low hemoglobin levels,</p>
<p>slightly low iron, slightly low ferritin,</p>
<p>but we have super amounts of energy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not anemic and we&rsquo;re getting along with great in life.</p>
<p>But a doctor who just looks at that might say,</p>
<p>oh, we need to give you more iron.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m getting at is an example</p>
<p>of we need to personalize medicine</p>
<p>and look at people over the long run</p>
<p>to know what works for them and what&rsquo;s healthy for them.</p>
<p>And not just work towards the average human,</p>
<p>but work towards what&rsquo;s optimal for human.</p>
<p>I love that answer.</p>
<p>You mentioned tracking and tracking over time.</p>
<p>And this is a really interesting area</p>
<p>that I know you have been focused on for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting blood work done about every six months,</p>
<p>frankly, since I was in college.</p>
<p>I just got, I like data</p>
<p>and I got interested in supplementation and exercise</p>
<p>because it made me feel better.</p>
<p>But I also want to know what was going on under the hood.</p>
<p>So you get numbers back.</p>
<p>You get this hormone, that hormone,</p>
<p>this blood glucose measure, et cetera.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of the data?</p>
<p>I mean, what InsideTracker is doing aside,</p>
<p>how do you personally make sense of the data</p>
<p>in ways that might differ from the way</p>
<p>that a standard MD might look at one of these charts?</p>
<p>Because the standard practice is to say,</p>
<p>is it red, yellow, or green, right?</p>
<p>Is it basically too high or too low?</p>
<p>Is it somewhere close to the margins or are you okay?</p>
<p>Are you in these ranges?</p>
<p>Are there any things that you pay attention to</p>
<p>that you think are particularly interesting</p>
<p>for people to just take note of?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not asking you</p>
<p>to go against anybody&rsquo;s physician,</p>
<p>but what sorts of things should people</p>
<p>start to educate themselves about</p>
<p>in terms of what these molecules are on their charts</p>
<p>if they choose to get them?</p>
<p>And what do you look at?</p>
<p>Yeah, wow, there&rsquo;s a lot there.</p>
<p>The first is that you should be tracking things</p>
<p>because one measurement isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>These things vary and over time.</p>
<p>And if you can have a decade or more of data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super informative, as you know well know,</p>
<p>as you know.</p>
<p>So the physician, interestingly, my physician,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take him as an example.</p>
<p>So he sees me, he says, how are you feeling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great.</p>
<p>Okay, see you next year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s craziness.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I say, okay, stop.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about-</p>
<p>Let me educate you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what David tells his physician.</p>
<p>I imagine that the 12-year-old David Sinclair</p>
<p>says to his physician, listen,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s have a different discussion.</p>
<p>Is that how it works?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>He finds me pretty annoying, as does my dentist.</p>
<p>So I say, stop, hang on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the InsideTracker data.</p>
<p>So I pull that up on the screen</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m showing him the changes in my cholesterol,</p>
<p>in my CRP, which is an inflammatory marker, as you know.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going through it</p>
<p>and you can see things change over time</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve corrected them as they go</p>
<p>slightly out of the optimal range for me,</p>
<p>which is different than what he would do, of course.</p>
<p>But what was funny is that he says, this is great.</p>
<p>I love this data, but I&rsquo;m not allowed to get this</p>
<p>because, of course, the insurance companies</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t pay for it.</p>
<p>So again, you can pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super expensive.</p>
<p>I would say if you save a bit of money</p>
<p>on a coffee, you can afford this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But the main point is that doctors do like this data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re unable to spend the money</p>
<p>on every one of their patients to get it.</p>
<p>Is there a code word that someone can use</p>
<p>with their physician</p>
<p>that will trigger a comprehensive blood test?</p>
<p>I keep trying to figure out what&rsquo;s the code</p>
<p>that one needs to ask or tell their doctor,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m feeling blank so that they get a full blood panel.</p>
<p>Well, do you have to be hemorrhaging</p>
<p>from the gut or something?</p>
<p>Well, I usually use the WTH method, which is what the hell.</p>
<p>And then he says, okay, we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people out there are thinking,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;d love to have blood work repeatedly over time,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s hard to get for financial reasons,</p>
<p>but also a lot of people just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to approach the conversation.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things</p>
<p>that I hope that we can educate people on,</p>
<p>that they deserve to know what&rsquo;s going on inside their body</p>
<p>and that it makes a doctor&rsquo;s visit worthwhile</p>
<p>and that you don&rsquo;t have to feign illness in order to do it.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, and a lot of people do.</p>
<p>So I would say, if you can&rsquo;t afford these tests,</p>
<p>there are an increasing number of companies</p>
<p>that offer these tests.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is one of them.</p>
<p>And you just do it a couple of times a year at a minimum,</p>
<p>and then you can share that with your doctor.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford that, then I would say to your doctor,</p>
<p>here are the main ones that Andrew and David do.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they must.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an email that is something like 555,</p>
<p>or a phone number, rather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 555-5555.</p>
<p>I think if they have any complaints,</p>
<p>they can just call that number.</p>
<p>David will pick up on East Coast business hours,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll pick up outside of those hours.</p>
<p>But there are some main ones.</p>
<p>I would say your blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>you want to do your HbA1c,</p>
<p>which is your average glucose levels over the month.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s CRP, which I mentioned for inflammation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about C-reactive protein for a second,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s been shown to be an early marker</p>
<p>of macular degeneration, of heart disease,</p>
<p>of a variety of different things.</p>
<p>CRP is something that we don&rsquo;t hear enough about, I think.</p>
<p>Maybe, what do you know about CRP that I don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing a lot.</p>
<p>Well, it was originally picked up as something</p>
<p>that was associated with heart disease</p>
<p>in the Framingham study, I believe.</p>
<p>It is the best marker for cardiovascular inflammation,</p>
<p>and also, we use it as a predictor of longevity.</p>
<p>And its levels go up with mortality.</p>
<p>And so this is an association,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s enough data that I would say,</p>
<p>if you have high levels of CRP,</p>
<p>you need to get your levels down quickly.</p>
<p>And the levels usually go up with age</p>
<p>and with levels of inflammation.</p>
<p>So the ways to get it down would be to switch the diet,</p>
<p>eat less, try to eat more vegetables.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find it will come down.</p>
<p>There are also drugs that can do it.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatories can do it as well.</p>
<p>But CRP is, it&rsquo;s actually HCRP.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a high-sensitive, or HSCRP.</p>
<p>Your doctor will know.</p>
<p>Get one of those readings,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;ve got normal blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>your doctor, or fasting blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>your doctor might say you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>But a lot of people have normal blood sugar,</p>
<p>but have high CRP, which is just as bad for you long-term,</p>
<p>and can predict a future heart attack.</p>
<p>Along the lines of heart attack,</p>
<p>I want your thoughts on cholesterol,</p>
<p>and serum cholesterol, and dietary cholesterol.</p>
<p>I cannot, for the life of me,</p>
<p>get my arms around this literature.</p>
<p>And even if I ignore all the essentially nonsense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there in various social media groups</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying cholesterol is the worst thing in the world,</p>
<p>or cholesterol is not, or dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>has nothing to do with serum cholesterol,</p>
<p>and nothing to do with longevity,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to sort through the very basic data</p>
<p>that essentially ask,</p>
<p>is having high levels of LDL gonna kill me earlier?</p>
<p>Should I be striving to always reduce LDL and increase HDL?</p>
<p>Is that a reasonable goal?</p>
<p>And if so, is dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>the primary determinant of that?</p>
<p>And just as a final point about this,</p>
<p>I am aware of quite good data</p>
<p>that shows that anorexics,</p>
<p>people that essentially eat no food</p>
<p>unless you force them to,</p>
<p>can often have very high LDL.</p>
<p>So their dietary cholesterol is essentially zero,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re manufacturing a lot of their own.</p>
<p>So realize this isn&rsquo;t your primary area of expertise,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a smart guy,</p>
<p>you think about this kind of stuff a lot.</p>
<p>What do you think is going on</p>
<p>with the cholesterol literature,</p>
<p>and will we ever get to the bottom of this</p>
<p>as a scientific and medical community?</p>
<p>Because to me, it is rather perplexing.</p>
<p>It is, but you can get through the politics.</p>
<p>I know a fair bit about cholesterol</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in my family history,</p>
<p>and I was headed for an early death.</p>
<p>My grandmother had a stroke at 30.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how bad I am in terms of my genetics.</p>
<p>So I went on a statin,</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who say that statins long-term are bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking a statin since I was 29,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because I forced my same doctor</p>
<p>to give me the statin.</p>
<p>The conversation was something like this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too young to be on a statin.</p>
<p>I said, what, you want me to have a heart attack</p>
<p>before you give me something?</p>
<p>Give it to me now.</p>
<p>So 29, I&rsquo;ve been on a statin,</p>
<p>and my cholesterol was way up beyond 300,</p>
<p>which is a massive mess.</p>
<p>Basically, my blood was creamy to look at.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve now got my cholesterol down to low, low levels</p>
<p>to, what would it be?</p>
<p>You can check on my inside tracker.</p>
<p>So my ratio of HDL to LDL,</p>
<p>which you want to be less than five, is now two,</p>
<p>and the LDL is below 100.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve measured my cardiovascular health with an MRI.</p>
<p>I got a movie of my heart beating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got a heart of a 20-year-old.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to forego the risk</p>
<p>that the statin is causing problems later</p>
<p>because of my family history.</p>
<p>But other people, I would say be aware</p>
<p>that statins aren&rsquo;t perfect drugs.</p>
<p>There are some interesting new ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one called the PSK9 inhibitor,</p>
<p>which is a, I think, fortnightly,</p>
<p>every two weeks injection</p>
<p>that blocks the release of LDL from the liver.</p>
<p>And then that seems to be great for lowering cholesterol,</p>
<p>but also has other benefits that might be pro-longevity.</p>
<p>And there are some people that I was just talking to</p>
<p>are on the cutting edge of this,</p>
<p>and their doctors are trying them on this drug</p>
<p>instead of the statin.</p>
<p>So you could talk to your doctor about that.</p>
<p>Do you avoid dietary cholesterol for that reason also?</p>
<p>Red meat, butter.</p>
<p>I mean, I happen to love butter.</p>
<p>I love red meat.</p>
<p>I realize there&rsquo;s some people who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My cholesterol is a little bit high,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m working to bring that down a bit,</p>
<p>although not by altering my food intake yet.</p>
<p>But what do you think is the relationship</p>
<p>between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going on with the liver?</p>
<p>Why are anorexics,</p>
<p>why is their serum cholesterol so high</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re eating nothing?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;ve been a number of papers over the years</p>
<p>that have been ignored.</p>
<p>And our friend, Peter Attia,</p>
<p>brought to my attention recently a new study</p>
<p>that I think definitively said that dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>has almost zero impact on blood cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m annoyed</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been avoiding eggs and butter</p>
<p>for most of my life, and I didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>So I have eggs for a long time.</p>
<p>Or at least in your case.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You can eat these foods that were once banned</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult to take cholesterol up</p>
<p>into the body from the gut.</p>
<p>And most of it&rsquo;s being synthesized in the body.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pausing there for a second</p>
<p>because I think that it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been told.</p>
<p>Six meals a day, eat a lot of grains and fruits</p>
<p>and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>You know, avoid cholesterol.</p>
<p>I mean, basically everything we learned</p>
<p>in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s</p>
<p>is getting flipped on its head now.</p>
<p>But, and I think this is a very strong caveat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to mention, amino acids.</p>
<p>In particular, the amino acids</p>
<p>that come from animal products, right?</p>
<p>Seem to have some pro-aging effect on them, right?</p>
<p>At least the way that I&rsquo;ve heard you describe your diet.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m somebody who enjoys meat.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>But, so I&rsquo;m by no means a vegan at all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard you say you eat mostly plants,</p>
<p>but a little bit of fish or chicken</p>
<p>or something of that sort, or eggs.</p>
<p>But is that specifically</p>
<p>to avoid excessive amino acid intake?</p>
<p>Or is it something specific about plants</p>
<p>that excites you with respect to that?</p>
<p>I mean, vegetables are delicious too.</p>
<p>But what is it?</p>
<p>Is it something great about plants</p>
<p>or is it something bad about,</p>
<p>when I think of meat,</p>
<p>I guess the biologist in me thinks amino acids, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think top sirloin, I think amino acid.</p>
<p>I think top sirloin as I&rsquo;m eating it,</p>
<p>but really what they are are amino acids, including leucine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there are two good things about plants</p>
<p>and neither of them is taste for me.</p>
<p>I would eat steak all the time if I could.</p>
<p>I did when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Australian.</p>
<p>But plants have two benefits.</p>
<p>One is that they&rsquo;re highly nutritious</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a lot of the vitamins</p>
<p>and nutrients that I need.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a multivitamin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have the excess iron in my body.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that high density nutrition.</p>
<p>So those dark leaves, if it&rsquo;s a spinach salad, great.</p>
<p>Second is that there is what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>xenohormetic molecules in plants.</p>
<p>That term xenohormesis is a term that I came up with</p>
<p>with my friend Conrad Howitz,</p>
<p>which means stressed plants make molecules</p>
<p>that benefit your health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll break it down.</p>
<p>Xeno means between species and hormesis</p>
<p>is the term whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you</p>
<p>makes you stronger and live longer.</p>
<p>And the idea is that when plants are stressed out,</p>
<p>think of a grapevine that&rsquo;s dried out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re starting to harvest the grapes,</p>
<p>which is typically how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>They are full with resveratrol</p>
<p>because resveratrol is a plant defense molecule</p>
<p>that I think is made to activate those sirtuin genes</p>
<p>in a plant.</p>
<p>So plants have sirtuins just like we do,</p>
<p>but by purifying or at least concentrating</p>
<p>in a light-proof bottle and keeping it out of the air,</p>
<p>we stabilize this xenohormetic molecule,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a cocktail, not just one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s others in wine.</p>
<p>We then ingest those and get the benefits</p>
<p>of activating our own defenses</p>
<p>because our food was getting stressed out.</p>
<p>And by stressed, I don&rsquo;t mean psychologically stressed.</p>
<p>I mean, biologically stressed.</p>
<p>And so I try to eat plants</p>
<p>that have gone through a bit of stress.</p>
<p>They might be brightly colored,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had too much sun</p>
<p>or got nibbled on by a caterpillar.</p>
<p>So you go to places where it&rsquo;s organic</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s fresh, local,</p>
<p>and those are the plants that aren&rsquo;t perfect</p>
<p>and they probably have high concentrations</p>
<p>of these molecules.</p>
<p>And in addition, I also buy the supplements</p>
<p>to make sure I&rsquo;m getting enough of those as well.</p>
<p>Which supplements mimic that?</p>
<p>Well, so resveratrol, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another one called quercetin,</p>
<p>or quercetin, some people call it,</p>
<p>which you find in trace amounts in apples and onions.</p>
<p>And we also showed back in 2003</p>
<p>that it activates sirtuins as well.</p>
<p>But others have, 20 years later,</p>
<p>found that it kills senescent cells</p>
<p>or helps kill senescent cells.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a double whammy with that molecule.</p>
<p>And are you actively picking out the peaches</p>
<p>that look like they were nibbled on by a caterpillar?</p>
<p>No, but I don&rsquo;t worry if they&rsquo;ve been banged up a bit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story with antioxidants?</p>
<p>Are they of any value whatsoever?</p>
<p>Because the way that you described them at the beginning</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve heard recently</p>
<p>is that they are not all the rage for anti-aging.</p>
<p>What are they doing that&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>Should we be seeking out antioxidants anyway</p>
<p>for other cellular health purposes?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, antioxidants are not going to hurt you</p>
<p>unless you take megadoses.</p>
<p>We do need some oxidants for our immune system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even what&rsquo;s called mitohormesis,</p>
<p>which is your mitochondria power packs</p>
<p>need to have a little bit of these free radicals</p>
<p>to be able to function.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to overdose on these antioxidants,</p>
<p>vitamin C, vitamin E, don&rsquo;t overdo it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t take a multivitamin, correct?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to stop after this conversation</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve always just taken one</p>
<p>for the kind of insurance purpose,</p>
<p>which is a stupid purpose, not actual insurance,</p>
<p>but just thinking, oh, you know, I&rsquo;ll top off on my ACBD.</p>
<p>Right, and I&rsquo;ll pee out what I don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Right, sure.</p>
<p>That never bothered me.</p>
<p>The whole expensive pee thing never got,</p>
<p>that argument never got me</p>
<p>because a good vitamin is not that expensive.</p>
<p>I just figured better safe than sorry,</p>
<p>but it may be that it&rsquo;s detrimental.</p>
<p>Well, it can in the case of iron,</p>
<p>as we discussed, and the antioxidants.</p>
<p>So when I came into the aging field in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>it was all about antioxidants.</p>
<p>And we thought that enzymes by the name of catalase</p>
<p>and superoxide dismutase</p>
<p>were going to be the key to longevity.</p>
<p>It turns out that it&rsquo;s largely been a failure</p>
<p>that giving animals and humans antioxidants</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had the longevity benefits that we dreamed of.</p>
<p>And the main reason is that there&rsquo;s a lot more going on</p>
<p>than just free radical damage.</p>
<p>The epigenome gets disrupted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got these proteins misfolding.</p>
<p>So the problem really has been that we didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that you need to turn on the body&rsquo;s natural defenses</p>
<p>against that plus a whole host of other things</p>
<p>to get the true benefits.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>taking an antioxidant drink.</p>
<p>Pomegranate juice, for one, is full of good stuff,</p>
<p>including xenohermetic molecules.</p>
<p>But resveratrol is a good case in point,</p>
<p>which is when I worked on resveratrol</p>
<p>as a longevity molecule,</p>
<p>first we showed it in yeast and worms and flies and mice.</p>
<p>Before that, it was thought that resveratrol</p>
<p>was good for your heart in red wine,</p>
<p>when you drink red wine, because it&rsquo;s an antioxidant.</p>
<p>So then we showed that it extended the lifespan</p>
<p>of yeast cells through this genetic pathway, the sirtuins.</p>
<p>And we then tested whether resveratrol,</p>
<p>if we changed one atom to make it not an antioxidant,</p>
<p>guess what?</p>
<p>It still worked fine.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t its antioxidant activity</p>
<p>that was extending lifespan,</p>
<p>it was its ability to turn on the yeast&rsquo;s defenses</p>
<p>against aging.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we gave the yeast antioxidants,</p>
<p>they lived shorter.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was the beginning of my transformation</p>
<p>into thinking, turn on the body&rsquo;s defenses,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give it the antioxidants.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for me to say</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to say for a long time,</p>
<p>which is that what&rsquo;s so wonderful about science</p>
<p>is that because the goal is mechanism,</p>
<p>you can really start to understand,</p>
<p>as you just described,</p>
<p>what actually mediates a process</p>
<p>is very different than what modulates a process.</p>
<p>I mean, if a fire alarm goes off in the building right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to modulate our attention.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it controls our attention,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not mechanistically relevant.</p>
<p>And so I think this thing about antioxidants</p>
<p>is one of these cases, it sounds like,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s in the right ballpark,</p>
<p>but until one really unveils the mechanism, as you have,</p>
<p>you can be, one can, or a field can be badly wrong</p>
<p>for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>It sounds like the sirtuins,</p>
<p>and really getting down to the guts of the machinery</p>
<p>of what causes cells to age is really what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>Zooming way out, what are the behavioral tools</p>
<p>that one can start to think about</p>
<p>in terms of ways to modulate these,</p>
<p>basically the way that DNA is being expressed</p>
<p>and functioning?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you talk before about hormesis of other sorts,</p>
<p>cold exposure, we talked about fasting,</p>
<p>we talked about exercise in broad terms,</p>
<p>but what about any evidence, if it exists,</p>
<p>as to whether or not aerobic training</p>
<p>versus weight training, these sorts of things?</p>
<p>In other words, what are the sorts of things</p>
<p>that people can do to improve the sirtuin pathway?</p>
<p>And I realize that they&rsquo;re caveats,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t go directly from a behavior to sirtuins,</p>
<p>but in the general theme, what can people do,</p>
<p>what do you do?</p>
<p>Right, well, we know that aerobic exercise</p>
<p>in mice and rats raises their NAD levels,</p>
<p>and their levels of sirt, one of the genes goes up,</p>
<p>two actually, number one and number three.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know yet is what type of exercise</p>
<p>is optimal to get them to change.</p>
<p>We will learn, we&rsquo;re doing work,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s revealed that we&rsquo;re doing work</p>
<p>with the military in the US</p>
<p>to try and understand that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll always tell you and the public,</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t know something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to extrapolate.</p>
<p>But what do I do?</p>
<p>I base my exercise on the scientific literature,</p>
<p>which has shown that maintaining muscle mass</p>
<p>is very important for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The two main ones are,</p>
<p>you want to maintain your hormone levels,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an older male losing my testosterone</p>
<p>and muscle mass over time.</p>
<p>And by exercising, I will maintain that and have.</p>
<p>In fact, I probably haven&rsquo;t had a body like this</p>
<p>since I was 20.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the benefits of having this lifestyle.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p>You know, we did an episode on hormones</p>
<p>and there are data in humans that show</p>
<p>that there are some males in their 80s and 90s</p>
<p>where their testosterone is equivalent</p>
<p>to the average of 25 and 30 year olds.</p>
<p>I can get you that information.</p>
<p>It is really impressive studies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t include a lot of information</p>
<p>about the lifestyle factors, et cetera.</p>
<p>But this idea that testosterone goes down with age,</p>
<p>it might be the trend,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Right, I believe in naturally increasing</p>
<p>and maintaining these hormone levels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been measuring them for a long time.</p>
<p>And I could see, for me,</p>
<p>my testosterone levels were steadily,</p>
<p>levels were going down.</p>
<p>And then you got tenure and they went back up again.</p>
<p>No, I actually became complacent.</p>
<p>And it was the worst, actually.</p>
<p>My age changed in the wrong direction after that</p>
<p>because I was relaxed and not worried about the future.</p>
<p>But then I got serious.</p>
<p>And I actually, according to the inside tracker algorithm,</p>
<p>got my age down from 58 to 31 in a matter of months.</p>
<p>That was a big drop.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been getting steadily younger over the last 10 years</p>
<p>according to that measurement, the blood tests.</p>
<p>What about estrogen?</p>
<p>Because women are different in the sense that they do</p>
<p>the number of eggs that they,</p>
<p>and the ovaries change over time, right?</p>
<p>Do you think that they can maintain estrogen levels</p>
<p>over longer periods of time</p>
<p>using some of these same protocols?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I get into trouble from a certain university</p>
<p>when I talk about this too much.</p>
<p>About estrogen?</p>
<p>Just about fertility and, long story,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too much into the anecdotes,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you the science,</p>
<p>which is that if you take a mouse</p>
<p>and put it on fasting or caloric restriction</p>
<p>for up until the point where it should be infertile,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s about it, at a year of age,</p>
<p>a mouse gets infertile, a female mouse.</p>
<p>Due to fasting or simply to aging?</p>
<p>Due to aging, due to aging.</p>
<p>The fasting, it&rsquo;s not extreme fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just less calories.</p>
<p>Then you put them back on a regular food</p>
<p>and they become fertile again</p>
<p>for many, many months afterwards.</p>
<p>So the effect on slowing down aging</p>
<p>is also on the reproductive system.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And so that, I wouldn&rsquo;t say to any woman,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t think that they should become super skinny</p>
<p>to try and preserve fertility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>But these pathways that we work on, these sirtuins,</p>
<p>are known to delay infertility in female animals.</p>
<p>Case in point, I&rsquo;m one of the lead authors on a paper</p>
<p>where we used NMN.</p>
<p>Remember, this is the gas, the fuel,</p>
<p>the petrol for the sirtuins.</p>
<p>We gave old mice, one group of mice was 16 months old.</p>
<p>Remember, they became infertile at 12.</p>
<p>Gave them NMN, and I think it was only six weeks later,</p>
<p>they had offspring.</p>
<p>They became fertile again, which goes against biology,</p>
<p>textbook biology, which is that female mammals</p>
<p>run out of eggs.</p>
<p>Turns out that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You can rejuvenate the female reproductive system</p>
<p>and even get them to come out of mouser pores,</p>
<p>as we call it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a whole new paradigm in biology as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m reminded of a set of studies</p>
<p>that were done by your former colleagues,</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;re no longer there,</p>
<p>David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,</p>
<p>my scientific great-grandparents,</p>
<p>won the Nobel Prize for discovering</p>
<p>what are called critical periods,</p>
<p>this phase of early development</p>
<p>when the brain is extremely plastic.</p>
<p>And a big part of their work was to show</p>
<p>that after a certain point,</p>
<p>the critical period shuts down.</p>
<p>Essentially, the brain can&rsquo;t change or not nearly as much.</p>
<p>And then people came along later</p>
<p>and showed that you could open up</p>
<p>these critical periods again, but very briefly.</p>
<p>And it takes a very specific stimulus, essentially.</p>
<p>High degrees of focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a well-known phenomenon in this literature</p>
<p>where if you take an animal,</p>
<p>and to some degree, this is being shown in humans as well,</p>
<p>and you let them pass through the critical period,</p>
<p>but then you essentially sensory deprive them.</p>
<p>You take away experience.</p>
<p>You close both eyes.</p>
<p>You essentially reopen the critical period.</p>
<p>So it seems like, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but mention this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this parallel between</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>with fertility and neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>where yes, there&rsquo;s a timer where certain things</p>
<p>are available to the organism early in life,</p>
<p>and then they tend to taper off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an open and shut, but they taper off.</p>
<p>But then a deprivation can actually reactivate</p>
<p>the availability of that process.</p>
<p>Forgive me, I just couldn&rsquo;t help but mention it.</p>
<p>But to me, both of those things are associated with youth,</p>
<p>fertility and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And so I think that it&rsquo;d be so interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to collaborate with you on this</p>
<p>to explore how neuroplasticity might actually be regulated</p>
<p>by these things like the sirtuins.</p>
<p>Right, and the sirtuins do control memory</p>
<p>in neurons as well.</p>
<p>So what I think is really interesting</p>
<p>is that what we&rsquo;re learning from work</p>
<p>that you and your colleagues have done,</p>
<p>and in my lab as well,</p>
<p>is that the body has remarkable powers of healing</p>
<p>and recovering from illness and injury.</p>
<p>And what we once thought was a one-way street,</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t repair,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get over these diseases,</p>
<p>you can reset the system.</p>
<p>And the body can really get rejuvenated</p>
<p>in ways that, in the future,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll wonder why didn&rsquo;t we work on this earlier?</p>
<p>The future of humanity is more like us</p>
<p>walking around like Deadpool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably be cleaner and we won&rsquo;t smell as badly,</p>
<p>but Deadpool, if you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>can get injured and just recover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to injure this guy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to be the same.</p>
<p>There are many species, you cut off the limb,</p>
<p>the limb grows back.</p>
<p>Salamanders, yeah.</p>
<p>We are now learning how to tap into that system.</p>
<p>And in part, what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is reversing the age of those cells</p>
<p>and telling them how to read the genes correctly again,</p>
<p>reversing the age of that epigenome.</p>
<p>And when you do that, the cells,</p>
<p>the brain, for instance, the skin,</p>
<p>we did the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about those results for a second.</p>
<p>Then I want to make sure that we return</p>
<p>to some of these behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>You had this amazing paper at the end of last year,</p>
<p>cover article, full article in Nature,</p>
<p>showing that essentially a small menu</p>
<p>of transcription factors,</p>
<p>which control gene expression, et cetera,</p>
<p>could essentially reverse the age of neurons in the eye</p>
<p>and rescue those cells against damage,</p>
<p>essentially allow blind mice to see again</p>
<p>and offset degeneration of these retinal cells.</p>
<p>Incredible paper and such a boon to the field.</p>
<p>Where does that stand now</p>
<p>in terms of human clinical trials?</p>
<p>I mean, what are you envisioning</p>
<p>in terms of the trajectory of those data</p>
<p>from mice into humans someday?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, to get to the point immediately,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be testing the treatment on monkeys,</p>
<p>just for safety reasons.</p>
<p>And then the first patient should be done</p>
<p>sometime in 2022, early 2023,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to try to recover blindness.</p>
<p>This involves making an injection</p>
<p>of a virus into the eye, right?</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s no way that I am aware of</p>
<p>to manipulate these transcription factors</p>
<p>through a pill or some other-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working on in my lab</p>
<p>at Harvard right now.</p>
<p>So it will be-</p>
<p>Pill-based modulation of transcription factors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be able to pop a pill</p>
<p>and the whole body gets rejuvenated by 20 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming for.</p>
<p>Now we do it with gene therapy in the eye and other places.</p>
<p>So in the eye, yes, it&rsquo;s a single injection.</p>
<p>The genes go into the retina</p>
<p>and we can turn it on with a drug called doxycycline.</p>
<p>And we do that in the mice for four to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Then the eye gets younger.</p>
<p>We can measure that because we can measure the clock.</p>
<p>And then the vision comes back in those mice.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see any reason why it shouldn&rsquo;t work in people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the same structures and mechanisms</p>
<p>that are on in the human as well.</p>
<p>Now these-</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one injection.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, injections into the eye,</p>
<p>obviously nobody should do this</p>
<p>outside of an ophthalmology clinic.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re definitely by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>But the injections into the eye are painless</p>
<p>if done correctly by the right person.</p>
<p>It sounds dreadful, but it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it done hundreds of times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it thousands of times.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to myself, but to other creatures.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a way of doing this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely painless to the person.</p>
<p>Oh, I feel it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tiny, tiny needle too.</p>
<p>But the great thing about this</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a one-time treatment.</p>
<p>Those genes go into the back of the eye</p>
<p>and stay there forever.</p>
<p>And you can just turn them on whenever you want.</p>
<p>So what we found is you can turn them on in the mice,</p>
<p>they get their vision back,</p>
<p>and then you turn it off again.</p>
<p>And so far, many months out, the benefit has remained.</p>
<p>But if it does decline, we&rsquo;ll just turn it back on</p>
<p>and reset the system, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>So one day what&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>is that we could potentially do this across the entire body</p>
<p>and just take this antibiotic every five years</p>
<p>and go back time and time again.</p>
<p>In thinking about the body</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on under the hood,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed still that there isn&rsquo;t a simple,</p>
<p>affordable technology that would allow me</p>
<p>to just look into my body</p>
<p>and see whether or not there are any tumors</p>
<p>growing anywhere.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that hard to look into the body.</p>
<p>I mean, that the technology exists.</p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t anybody created an at-home</p>
<p>or pseudo at-home solution,</p>
<p>like a clinic where you can go</p>
<p>and pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks</p>
<p>and see if you have any tumors growing in your body?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s still expensive.</p>
<p>You can get your doctor to try to get you in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some companies that offer blood tests</p>
<p>that look at circulating DNA that&rsquo;ll measure it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still probably five to 10 years away</p>
<p>from being really cheap.</p>
<p>You can do things like a colon cancer test at home.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a hundred and something dollars.</p>
<p>You ship off your shit, excuse my language,</p>
<p>and they measure it.</p>
<p>And they tell you if you&rsquo;ve got colon cancer</p>
<p>with high probability.</p>
<p>I did that during the pandemic</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want to get a colonoscopy.</p>
<p>Is it more accurate or as accurate as a colonoscopy?</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s close to being as accurate.</p>
<p>The downside is that during a colonoscopy,</p>
<p>they can pinch off the polyps that are looking dangerous,</p>
<p>whereas this obviously isn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly easier to do.</p>
<p>And my father, who&rsquo;s Australian,</p>
<p>tells me that it&rsquo;s free for Australians.</p>
<p>They get this test routinely.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I want to return to the topic that I took us away from,</p>
<p>so I apologize, which is behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>Do you regularly do the cold shower thing,</p>
<p>ice baths, cold water swims?</p>
<p>Are you into that whole biz?</p>
<p>Well, you do know that I&rsquo;ve done it at least once</p>
<p>because we did it together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Not the same bath, just to be very clear.</p>
<p>Same sauna, different ice baths.</p>
<p>The idea of Sinclair and Huberman</p>
<p>taking an ice bath together is,</p>
<p>it might warm some people&rsquo;s hearts,</p>
<p>but just to be very clear,</p>
<p>different, same ice bath, different times.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you for clarifying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do them regularly.</p>
<p>I do try to sleep cool.</p>
<p>I sleep better anyway.</p>
<p>I try to dress without a lot of warm clothes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here in a T-shirt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s middle of summer,</p>
<p>but in winter I&rsquo;ll try to wear a T-shirt too.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re challenging your system to thermoregulate.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this hypothesis with Ray Cronus.</p>
<p>We published what&rsquo;s called the metabolic winter hypothesis,</p>
<p>which is tens of thousands of years ago,</p>
<p>we were either hungry or cold or both.</p>
<p>And we rarely experience that now.</p>
<p>And so we try to give ourselves the metabolic winter.</p>
<p>And part of the problem, I think,</p>
<p>with the obesity epidemic is that we&rsquo;re never cold.</p>
<p>And cold, when you&rsquo;re cold, you have to burn energy.</p>
<p>It may be only slightly,</p>
<p>but over the whole night, if you&rsquo;re a little bit cool,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually expend more energy.</p>
<p>So I try to do that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of cold showers.</p>
<p>The sauna, I don&rsquo;t have access to my gym as much as I did.</p>
<p>But I do want to get back into it.</p>
<p>I used to do it regularly with my son</p>
<p>and I posted on Instagram once</p>
<p>that he could stay in there for 15 minutes</p>
<p>and I could only stay in for about three.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short,</p>
<p>I try to compensate with changes in my diet and exercise</p>
<p>until I get back into it.</p>
<p>You reminded me of something that I meant to ask earlier,</p>
<p>that obesity reduces NAD levels and accelerates aging.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>I mean, okay, so again, this is the scientist in us.</p>
<p>So someone&rsquo;s carrying a lot of excess adipose tissues,</p>
<p>subcutaneous and visceral fat,</p>
<p>but why should that reduce NAD in any ways</p>
<p>that are independent of effects on glucose and insulin?</p>
<p>Is there something direct about white adipose tissue?</p>
<p>And the reason I ask this</p>
<p>is not simply to dig into mechanism alone,</p>
<p>but I think there are really interesting data now</p>
<p>that fat actually gets neural innervation.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just stored fuel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stored fuel that&rsquo;s acting</p>
<p>as an endocrine organ, essentially.</p>
<p>So yeah, why would being fat make people age faster?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a question that is so obvious,</p>
<p>but so few people ask it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes you a good scientist.</p>
<p>And so that we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you my best answer,</p>
<p>which is that obesity comes along with a lot of problems</p>
<p>that include a lot of senescent cells in fat.</p>
<p>If you stain old fat for senescent cells, it lights up.</p>
<p>And when you kill off those cells,</p>
<p>at least in mice and maybe in humans, it looks like,</p>
<p>the fat is less toxic to the body</p>
<p>because those senescent cells in the fat</p>
<p>are secreting these inflammatory molecules</p>
<p>that will accelerate aging, as we now know.</p>
<p>You talk about the sirtuins in NAD.</p>
<p>So if we just look philosophically at why this would be,</p>
<p>the sirtuins only like to come on or get activated</p>
<p>when the body needs, is under adversity.</p>
<p>And if a cell is surrounded by fat</p>
<p>or contains a lot of fat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to think times are good,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to switch on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the evolutionary argument.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it could have something to do</p>
<p>with the response to glucose,</p>
<p>which then responds to the sirtuin gene.</p>
<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t been worked out very well.</p>
<p>And is there any evidence that leptin,</p>
<p>this hormone from fat,</p>
<p>can actually interact with the sirtuin pathway?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall seeing that.</p>
<p>Maybe I could do a sabbatical in your lab</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;d be a fun one.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Because leptin during development</p>
<p>is what triggers the permission</p>
<p>for the hypothalamus to enter puberty, right?</p>
<p>This is why kids that eat a lot when they&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>and get overweight will also start</p>
<p>to undergo puberty more quickly,</p>
<p>although they have reproductive issues later.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we should study the hypothalamus together</p>
<p>because the hypothalamus can control the aging of the body.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the brain.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>If you turn on the SIRT1 gene,</p>
<p>the sirtuin gene that we work on in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>it actually will extend lifespan.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s been shown by Dongsheng Cai</p>
<p>at Albert Einstein College of Medicine</p>
<p>that if you inhibit inflammation</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus in a mouse,</p>
<p>it will increase or maintain the expression</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called GNRH,</p>
<p>which is the hormone that he found</p>
<p>actually controls longevity in the mouse in part.</p>
<p>And so keeping inflammation down in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>is sufficient to extend the lifespan of animals.</p>
<p>And I reviewed that paper for Nature about seven years ago.</p>
<p>And that was the first demonstration</p>
<p>that the hypothalamus is one of the leading regulators</p>
<p>of the body&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>GNRH, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>actually comes from neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that then literally reach down into the pituitary</p>
<p>and trigger the release of all the things</p>
<p>that control fertility, luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a powerful set of neurons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never really been clear</p>
<p>what at a behavioral level triggers the release of GNRH.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all the stories about pheromones</p>
<p>and timers in puberty, et cetera.</p>
<p>But environmental conditions and dietary conditions</p>
<p>and behaviors that can control GNRH release,</p>
<p>I think, is an incredible area for exploration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to do that sabbatical, by the way.</p>
<p>I have a couple, well, seemingly random questions,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t help but ask,</p>
<p>because one thing I like to do is forage the internet</p>
<p>for practices that at least more than a few people are doing</p>
<p>and then wonder whether or not there&rsquo;s any basis for it.</p>
<p>You mentioned methylation as a detrimental process,</p>
<p>the way it disrupts the epigenome,</p>
<p>the CD reader, so to speak.</p>
<p>There are people out there who are ingesting methylene blue.</p>
<p>And when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I used methylene blue to clean my fish tank.</p>
<p>And I love fish tanks.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re into aquaria also.</p>
<p>A different podcast episode, we&rsquo;ll talk about aquaria.</p>
<p>But why in the world would people ingest methylene blue?</p>
<p>Meaning, is their logic correct?</p>
<p>And, or is that a dangerous practice?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to ingest methylene blue.</p>
<p>Sounds like a bad thing to do.</p>
<p>It stains your body, you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>These people couldn&rsquo;t turn blue.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was someone in my lab as a postdoc</p>
<p>was using it to study a completely different process</p>
<p>related to the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And he used to inject it into animals</p>
<p>and they would turn blue.</p>
<p>But then again, people ingest colloid silver.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ll put in there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this, please people don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>or if you do, just don&rsquo;t tell me,</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>People put it in their eyes.</p>
<p>And some people actually stain their skin.</p>
<p>They actually become kind of this silver purple brown color</p>
<p>if they do it excessively.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of crazy stuff out there.</p>
<p>But what do you think they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>with this methylene blue thing?</p>
<p>Or should we just get them to a good psychiatrist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>I think methylene blue was found to extend the lifespan</p>
<p>of some lower organism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it came from.</p>
<p>My recollection of it-</p>
<p>With the emphasis on lower organisms.</p>
<p>Yes, smaller organisms.</p>
<p>I think doesn&rsquo;t, do you remember, Andrew,</p>
<p>does it interrupt or interfere with mitochondrial activity?</p>
<p>And that might be like-</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need to look this up and post it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>But those methyls, let&rsquo;s talk about those.</p>
<p>Those methyls have to be placed</p>
<p>on the right part of the genome.</p>
<p>They get attached to the right genes and the wrong genes.</p>
<p>And if you have a lot of methylation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to mess up the epigenome.</p>
<p>Smoking will do that,</p>
<p>a lack of exercise, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>So what you actually want to do is you want to measure it</p>
<p>and make sure what you&rsquo;re doing with your body is working.</p>
<p>How do you know that if you do this</p>
<p>or that is actually helping?</p>
<p>And so you can test your age.</p>
<p>I could take a swab from your mouth</p>
<p>and tell you how old you are biologically.</p>
<p>And then we could work on trying to bring that down.</p>
<p>And actually there are anecdotes now</p>
<p>that people are reversing their age by a decade or more</p>
<p>just by doing some of the things that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>and some other cutting edge stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to write about.</p>
<p>But yeah, but you have to measure stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t want to forget to bring that up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m measuring stuff all the time.</p>
<p>I have blood tests like you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this monitor that&rsquo;s stuck to my chest right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s measuring myself a thousand times a second.</p>
<p>And I measure my biological age.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it measuring a thousand times a second?</p>
<p>A huge host of things?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So this little device is stuck here</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s for two weeks that you just recharge it</p>
<p>or send it back and get a new one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a body temperature movement,</p>
<p>heart rate variability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an FDA approved device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a toy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one of these recreational things.</p>
<p>It also listens to my voice.</p>
<p>Eventually it&rsquo;ll tell me if I need a psychiatrist</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m depressed.</p>
<p>It will tell me how I sleep obviously.</p>
<p>But when you put all that data together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s individualized and anonymized,</p>
<p>it can now tell my doctor in real time</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve got a cold that needs an antibiotic</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just a virus,</p>
<p>if I am suffering from COVID-19</p>
<p>or even if I&rsquo;m going to have a heart attack next week.</p>
<p>And so these little devices</p>
<p>are going to be with us all the time</p>
<p>instead of going to your doctor once a year,</p>
<p>which is ludicrous.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about x-rays</p>
<p>because every time I go through the scanner at the airport,</p>
<p>I think Sinclair would never do this.</p>
<p>And the argument I heard you give about this before</p>
<p>was a really excellent one,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s a low level amount of radiation</p>
<p>going through at the airport.</p>
<p>But the argument is always,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s just as much as on the plane.</p>
<p>And your argument, your counter argument,</p>
<p>I should say was,</p>
<p>well, then why would I want to do both, right?</p>
<p>So when you go to the airport,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re not running late</p>
<p>and you have to go through the standard line,</p>
<p>what do you say to them?</p>
<p>Do you say, I&rsquo;m David Sinclair?</p>
<p>And then they shuttle you to your own line.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>You do say, I don&rsquo;t like this thing.</p>
<p>Do you have to give them a reason?</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can say, I don&rsquo;t want this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get annoyed</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard for them to pat you down.</p>
<p>But you get a pat down and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not in a hurry, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If you want to pay for the TSA pre in America</p>
<p>or the way to get around those scanners,</p>
<p>you can do that.</p>
<p>So I travel a lot, so it&rsquo;s worth it anyway.</p>
<p>But I just go through the metal detector.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get scanned.</p>
<p>And the metal detector doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem.</p>
<p>And what about x-rays at the dentist?</p>
<p>Well, one x-ray is not going to kill you.</p>
<p>Two is not going to kill you.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d rather-</p>
<p>Three will kill you.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I try to limit it because it&rsquo;s cumulative.</p>
<p>And I went for six years without having a dental x-ray.</p>
<p>And then my last visit, I just gave up.</p>
<p>I was tired of arguing with my dentist.</p>
<p>So they gave me one,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve got lead coats on</p>
<p>and they put lead all over your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s telling you something right there.</p>
<p>And funnily enough, my teeth hadn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>Now you could balance that by saying,</p>
<p>well, one x-ray, two x-rays, three x-rays</p>
<p>is worth it if I have cavities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You want to know what&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>But doing it regularly for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think was worth it</p>
<p>because my teeth are in perfect health</p>
<p>and have always been.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have any cavities.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have braces.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So stop scanning me.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you have to pay for the machine,</p>
<p>but do I have a choice?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So stop pressuring me.</p>
<p>You know, who shared your sentiments about x-rays</p>
<p>and the dentist in general,</p>
<p>my apologies to the dentists out there,</p>
<p>was the great physicist, Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>This is a story about him that&rsquo;s not especially well-known,</p>
<p>but he had very serious health concerns about x-rays</p>
<p>because he understood the physics</p>
<p>and he understood enough biology</p>
<p>that he was actually quite vocal</p>
<p>about his dislike of dental technology and its dangers.</p>
<p>And he talked about some of that.</p>
<p>People can find that on the internet if they like.</p>
<p>Speaking of people who are like Feynman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been engaged in public discourse about science,</p>
<p>one of the things that I appreciate about you,</p>
<p>in fact, the way that you and I</p>
<p>initially came to know one another</p>
<p>is through your public health education efforts.</p>
<p>So obviously we&rsquo;re doing this podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done the Joe Rogan podcast,</p>
<p>Lex Friedman&rsquo;s podcast, excuse me, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still adjusting that.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman podcast and many other podcasts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written an amazing book.</p>
<p>What are you thinking these days</p>
<p>in terms of what the world needs</p>
<p>in terms of education from scientists,</p>
<p>education from MDs, education in general</p>
<p>as it relates to these things?</p>
<p>Because I think if nothing else,</p>
<p>2020 revealed to us that there&rsquo;s a gap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gap in understanding</p>
<p>and that the scientists too are guilty</p>
<p>of not knowing what to do with all the information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there on PubMed or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Just what are you thinking for yourself?</p>
<p>And in general, I&rsquo;d like to just know,</p>
<p>what do you think the world needs there?</p>
<p>Maybe we can recruit some more public educators.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve gone from a time</p>
<p>when you and I were in college and young professors</p>
<p>where the only way to get our voice out to the public</p>
<p>was either through a newspaper</p>
<p>or a very short radio interview,</p>
<p>which for me was extremely frustrating</p>
<p>because particularly the newspapers and my topic</p>
<p>every time was twisted into something</p>
<p>that was not just embarrassing,</p>
<p>but Harvard University used to bring me</p>
<p>into the back office and slam my wrist.</p>
<p>How did you say such a thing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all going to live to 150, I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now also in a world</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re overwhelmed with information</p>
<p>and most of it is wrong</p>
<p>and anyone can pretend to be an expert.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gone from early days to now the future</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re experiencing it right now</p>
<p>thanks to guys like you, people like you</p>
<p>is that the experts, some experts,</p>
<p>a small number who are brilliant and good communicators</p>
<p>are talking directly to the public.</p>
<p>This has never been able to be possible</p>
<p>until this time right now.</p>
<p>So another five years from now,</p>
<p>and certainly by 10 years,</p>
<p>I would hope that there are trusted sources of information</p>
<p>of people who cannot just communicate the ideas directly</p>
<p>but are able to talk about things that are going on</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t even published yet to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>and this is what the future looks like.</p>
<p>But this is somebody like yourself</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s spent their whole life studying a particular topic</p>
<p>and knows what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And this is also something that I think most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know that we scientists,</p>
<p>if we tell a lie, we burst into flames.</p>
<p>We absolutely cannot tell something that&rsquo;s untrue</p>
<p>and to the best of our knowledge, we say it as it is,</p>
<p>because if we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re beaten up</p>
<p>or we kicked out of the university.</p>
<p>So the people who survived to our age,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a little older than you,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve survived a bit longer.</p>
<p>But a lot younger inside.</p>
<p>No, but we have to measure you with my swab test.</p>
<p>I probably need a little help, hopefully not too much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll measure that and we&rsquo;ll work on your eating.</p>
<p>But this is really, really important</p>
<p>is that finally people like you are allowed</p>
<p>by our universities to talk to the public.</p>
<p>I used to do it with a real threat</p>
<p>to my survival.</p>
<p>People would look at me, oh, he&rsquo;s a salesman,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s promoting this and that.</p>
<p>It was seen as a real negative.</p>
<p>But finally, I think we&rsquo;re in a world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not negative anymore.</p>
<p>And the pandemic showed that we needed voices of reason,</p>
<p>voices of fact that you could trust.</p>
<p>And you can see the popularity of your podcast</p>
<p>shows that the public, they&rsquo;re desperate for facts</p>
<p>that they can trust</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know what to believe anymore.</p>
<p>Well, I am being completely honest when I say this,</p>
<p>that I followed your lead.</p>
<p>I saw you on the Joe Rogan podcast and my jaw dropped.</p>
<p>I was like, this is amazing.</p>
<p>Because he had had other good scientists on before,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a tenured professor at Harvard Genetics,</p>
<p>Department of Genetics.</p>
<p>And for those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Harvard and of course Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both excellent, of course.</p>
<p>But these are the top, top tiers of academia.</p>
<p>And I certainly understand what it takes to get there</p>
<p>and survive there and to thrive there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a game of pinball.</p>
<p>You never win.</p>
<p>You just get to, if you&rsquo;re doing really well,</p>
<p>you get to keep playing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the truth in academia.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not, you stop playing basically.</p>
<p>But when I saw you explain what you were doing</p>
<p>in a way that was accessible to people</p>
<p>and also talking about possible protocols</p>
<p>that they might explore for themselves</p>
<p>to see if those were right for them,</p>
<p>I was just dazzled and excited</p>
<p>and I made every effort to get in contact with you</p>
<p>and the rest is history.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s really exciting to me these days</p>
<p>is because of 2020 and everything that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>and it continues to happen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this direct to the public route</p>
<p>that you mentioned.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s also an openness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on this,</p>
<p>but it seems to me that there&rsquo;s an openness</p>
<p>from the general public about health practices,</p>
<p>that there are actually things that people can do</p>
<p>to control their stress level,</p>
<p>to control their sleep, to control their cholesterol,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what they need to do, maybe they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and to even control their lifespan,</p>
<p>which I think is remarkable.</p>
<p>And I know I speak on behalf of so many people</p>
<p>when I just, I want to say thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve truly changed the course of my life.</p>
<p>I would not be sitting here doing this</p>
<p>were it not for your example.</p>
<p>And I always say, Sinclair, many people have written books,</p>
<p>many academics have written books, as you have,</p>
<p>but in terms of doing podcasts</p>
<p>and really getting out there with your message</p>
<p>in a way that I have to assume raised your cortisol level</p>
<p>and heart rate just a little bit,</p>
<p>but you did it nonetheless.</p>
<p>You were truly first man in and that deserves a nod</p>
<p>and I have a great debt of gratitude to you for that.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, Andrew.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve become a good friend</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m super proud of what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and I know what you will do.</p>
<p>So in addition to your book</p>
<p>and your presence on social media, Instagram and Twitter,</p>
<p>and appearances on podcasts,</p>
<p>recently I&rsquo;ve noticed that you&rsquo;ve opened up</p>
<p>a sort of an email slash website that people can ask,</p>
<p>access, excuse me, to get some information</p>
<p>about their own health and rates of aging.</p>
<p>Tell us about that and what&rsquo;s being measured</p>
<p>and what is this test that you&rsquo;ve been working on secretly</p>
<p>and now soon not so secretly?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, what I want is a credit score for the body</p>
<p>to make it easy for people to follow their health</p>
<p>and there is a number.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a biological age that you can measure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the test is many hundreds of dollars</p>
<p>right now, but in my lab,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to bring that down a lot</p>
<p>and so I want to democratize this test</p>
<p>so that everybody has access to a score for their health</p>
<p>that can predict not just their future health</p>
<p>and time of death, but to change it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m building a system</p>
<p>that will point people in the right direction</p>
<p>and give them discounts for certain things</p>
<p>that will improve not just their health now,</p>
<p>but 10, 20, 30 years into the future.</p>
<p>We can measure that and very cheaply keep measuring it</p>
<p>to know that you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t measure something,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t optimize it.</p>
<p>And so this is the biological age test.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve developed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple mouth swab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rolling it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building the system right now</p>
<p>and there is a sign-up sheet</p>
<p>because a lot of people want to get in line.</p>
<p>Go to drsinclair.com.</p>
<p>You can get on that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be one of the first people in the world</p>
<p>to get this test and see what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Oh, fantastic.</p>
<p>Will people be celebrating their biological age birthdays?</p>
<p>In other words, if I&rsquo;m minus,</p>
<p>like if I could imagine, so I&rsquo;m 45 right now,</p>
<p>soon to be 46, but if I were to be so lucky</p>
<p>as to get my biological age to 35 within 12 months,</p>
<p>maybe you can help me do that.</p>
<p>Do I get to celebrate a negative birthday?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And my plan is that those people</p>
<p>who take their age back a year or more,</p>
<p>we think we can go back 20 years.</p>
<p>Eventually, they&rsquo;ll get a birthday card from me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a negative birthday card.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And probably very little actual birthday cake being ingested</p>
<p>but who cares because you&rsquo;re living that much longer.</p>
<p>Until it&rsquo;s full of stevia, that&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking to us today.</p>
<p>I realized I took us down deep into the guts of mechanism</p>
<p>and as well, talking about global protocols,</p>
<p>everything from what one can do and take if they choose,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for them,</p>
<p>to how to think about this whole process</p>
<p>that we talk about when we talk about lifespan</p>
<p>as always incredibly illuminating.</p>
<p>Thank you, David.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andrew.</p>
