    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss light</p>
<p>and the many powerful uses of light to optimize our health.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss the use of light</p>
<p>for optimizing skin health, appearance, and longevity,</p>
<p>for wound healing, for optimizing hormone balance,</p>
<p>and for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,</p>
<p>and even for offsetting dementia.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why light has such powerful effects</p>
<p>on so many different aspects of our biology</p>
<p>is that it can be translated</p>
<p>into electrical signals in our brain and body,</p>
<p>into hormone signals in our brain and body,</p>
<p>and indeed into what we call</p>
<p>cascades of biological pathways,</p>
<p>meaning light can actually change the genes</p>
<p>that the cells of your bodies express,</p>
<p>and that is true throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Today, I will discuss the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which all of that occurs.</p>
<p>I promise to make it clear for those of you</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a biology background,</p>
<p>and if you do have a biology background,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and provide sufficient depth</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s still of interest to you.</p>
<p>And I promise to give you tools,</p>
<p>very specific protocols that are extracted</p>
<p>from the peer review literature</p>
<p>that will allow you to use different so-called wavelengths,</p>
<p>which most of us think of as colors, of light</p>
<p>in order to modulate your health</p>
<p>in the ways that are most important to you.</p>
<p>For those of you that are thinking</p>
<p>that the use of light to modulate health</p>
<p>falls under the category of woo science,</p>
<p>pseudoscience, or biohacking,</p>
<p>well, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, in 1903, the Nobel Prize was given</p>
<p>to Niels Finsen, he was Icelandic,</p>
<p>he lived in Denmark, for the use of phototherapy</p>
<p>for the treatment of lupus.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more than a hundred years of quality science</p>
<p>emphasizing the use of light,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;ll soon see,</p>
<p>the use of particular wavelengths or colors of light</p>
<p>in order to modulate the activity of cells</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>So while it is the case that many places</p>
<p>and companies are selling therapies and products</p>
<p>related to the use of flashing lights and colored lights,</p>
<p>promising specific outcomes from everything</p>
<p>from stem cell renewal to improvement of brain function,</p>
<p>and some of those don&rsquo;t have any basis in science,</p>
<p>there are phototherapies that do have</p>
<p>a strong foundation in quality science,</p>
<p>and those are the studies and the protocols</p>
<p>that we are going to discuss today.</p>
<p>But I thought that people might appreciate</p>
<p>knowing that over a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>people were thinking about the use of light</p>
<p>for the treatment of various diseases</p>
<p>and for improving health,</p>
<p>and indeed, many of those therapies are used today</p>
<p>in high quality hospitals and research institutions,</p>
<p>and of course, clinics and homes around the world.</p>
<p>One of the more exciting examples of phototherapy</p>
<p>in the last few years is the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Dr. Glenn Jeffrey at University College London.</p>
<p>The Jeffrey Lab is known for doing pioneering</p>
<p>and very rigorous research</p>
<p>in the realm of visual neuroscience,</p>
<p>and in the last decade or so,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve turned their attention to exploring the role</p>
<p>of red light therapy for offsetting age-related vision loss.</p>
<p>What they discovered is that just brief exposures</p>
<p>to red light early in the day</p>
<p>can offset much of the vision loss</p>
<p>that occurs in people 40 years or older.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable about these studies</p>
<p>is that the entire duration of the therapy</p>
<p>is just one to three minutes done</p>
<p>just a few times per week.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more exciting</p>
<p>is that they understand the mechanism</p>
<p>by which this occurred.</p>
<p>The cells in the back of the eye</p>
<p>that convert light information into electrical signals</p>
<p>that the rest of the brain can understand</p>
<p>and create visual images from,</p>
<p>well, those cells are extremely metabolically active.</p>
<p>They need a lot of ATP or energy.</p>
<p>And as we age, those cells get less efficient</p>
<p>at creating that ATP and energy.</p>
<p>Exposure to red light early in the day,</p>
<p>and it does have to be early in the day,</p>
<p>allowed those cells to replenish the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which they create ATP.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about these experiments in more detail</p>
<p>later in the episode and the protocols</p>
<p>so that you can apply those protocols should you choose.</p>
<p>But I use this as an example of our growing understanding</p>
<p>of not just that phototherapies work, but how they work.</p>
<p>And it is through the linking of protocols and mechanism</p>
<p>that we, meaning all of us,</p>
<p>can start to apply phototherapies</p>
<p>in a rational, safe, and powerful way.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything</p>
<p>you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about light.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about the physics of light,</p>
<p>and I promise to make that very clear,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in physics.</p>
<p>And then I want to talk about the biology of light,</p>
<p>meaning how light is converted into signals</p>
<p>that your brain and body can use</p>
<p>to impact things like organ health or disease,</p>
<p>or how you can use light</p>
<p>in order to repair particular organs,</p>
<p>like your skin, your eyes, your brain, et cetera.</p>
<p>The physics of light can be made very simple</p>
<p>by just illustrating a few key bullet points.</p>
<p>The first bullet point</p>
<p>is that light is electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p>If the word electromagnetic feels daunting to you,</p>
<p>well then just discard that</p>
<p>and just think of light as energy.</p>
<p>And think of energy as something</p>
<p>that can impact other things in its environment.</p>
<p>Now, the way to imagine light</p>
<p>or to conceptualize light as energy</p>
<p>is that all around you,</p>
<p>light is traveling in these little wavelengths.</p>
<p>And the reason, for those of you that are watching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a little wavy motion with my hand,</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s actually the way</p>
<p>that light energy moves in little waves.</p>
<p>Just like sound waves are coming at you</p>
<p>and impinging on your ears.</p>
<p>If you can hear me talking right now, that is happening.</p>
<p>Those are sound waves,</p>
<p>meaning the movement of air particles out there</p>
<p>impacting your eardrum.</p>
<p>Well, light energy is just little bits</p>
<p>of electromagnetic energy</p>
<p>traveling through your environment all the time</p>
<p>in these little waves</p>
<p>and impinging on your brain and body and eyes, et cetera.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>energy can change the way that other things behave.</p>
<p>It can cause reactions in cells of your body.</p>
<p>It can cause reactions in fruit, for instance, right?</p>
<p>You see a piece of fruit and it&rsquo;s not ripe,</p>
<p>but it gets a lot of sunlight and it ripens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the electromagnetic energy of sunlight</p>
<p>had an impact on that plant or that tree</p>
<p>or even on the fruit directly.</p>
<p>As a parallel example of energy</p>
<p>and its ability to impact other things,</p>
<p>we are all familiar with food</p>
<p>and the fact that food has calories.</p>
<p>Calorie is a measure of energy.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with how much heat is generated</p>
<p>when you burn a particular article of food,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>And it turns out that how hot a given article of food burns</p>
<p>gives you a sense of how much energy</p>
<p>it can provide your body</p>
<p>in terms of your body&rsquo;s ability to store</p>
<p>or use that energy.</p>
<p>So again, think of light as electromagnetic energy,</p>
<p>but really put that word energy into capital letters.</p>
<p>Embed that in your mind going forward</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll understand most of the first bullet point</p>
<p>of what light is in terms of the physics of light.</p>
<p>Now, the second thing that you need to understand</p>
<p>about the physics of light</p>
<p>is that light has many different wavelengths.</p>
<p>And the simplest way to conceptualize this</p>
<p>is to imagine that cover of that Pink Floyd album</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a prism,</p>
<p>you have a white beam of light going into that prism,</p>
<p>and then the prism splits that beam of light</p>
<p>into what looks like a rainbow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got your reds, your orange, your greens,</p>
<p>your blues, your purples, et cetera.</p>
<p>Anytime we have light in our environment</p>
<p>that is so-called white light,</p>
<p>it includes all those wavelengths,</p>
<p>but sunlight and other forms of light</p>
<p>also have other wavelengths of light that we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So when we think about the rainbow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the visible spectrum of light.</p>
<p>There are also wavelengths of light</p>
<p>that are not visible to us,</p>
<p>but that are visible to some other animals</p>
<p>and that can still impact your brain and body</p>
<p>because there is still energy at those wavelengths.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a few examples of this.</p>
<p>Humans are not a species that can see</p>
<p>into the infrared realm of the spectrum.</p>
<p>A pit viper, meaning a snake that has infrared sensors,</p>
<p>however, can sense in the infrared.</p>
<p>So if you were to walk through a jungle</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a pit viper there,</p>
<p>it sees you as a cloud of heat emission</p>
<p>because your body is emitting infrared energy all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re casting off infrared energy.</p>
<p>The snake can see it, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you were to put on a particular set of goggles</p>
<p>that were infrared goggles,</p>
<p>well, then you would be able to see the heat emissions</p>
<p>of any organism, human or otherwise,</p>
<p>that could emit infrared energy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the opposite end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>We are familiar with seeing things that are blue or green</p>
<p>or very pale blue, but as we say below that,</p>
<p>meaning even shorter wavelength light is out there.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet light is a really good example</p>
<p>of light energy that&rsquo;s coming from the sun</p>
<p>and is in our environment</p>
<p>and is being reflected off surfaces all the time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And yet if it&rsquo;s very bright outside,</p>
<p>that ultraviolet light can burn our skin.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll learn in today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>ultraviolet light can also positively impact us.</p>
<p>In fact, I will describe a particular set of new results</p>
<p>that show that ultraviolet light</p>
<p>viewed for just a few minutes each day</p>
<p>or landing on the skin for just a few minutes each day</p>
<p>can actually offset a lot of pain.</p>
<p>It actually has the ability to reduce the amount of pain</p>
<p>sensed by your body.</p>
<p>And we now understand the specific circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body that allow that to happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about that</p>
<p>and the related protocols a little bit later.</p>
<p>So the important thing to understand</p>
<p>about the physics of light</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s energy at all these different wavelengths.</p>
<p>We only see some of those wavelengths,</p>
<p>which basically is to say that light impacts us</p>
<p>at many different levels.</p>
<p>And the so-called levels that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>are the different wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re welcome to think of the different wavelengths</p>
<p>of light as different colors,</p>
<p>but do understand that there are truly colors of light</p>
<p>that you and I can&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>and yet that have powerful impact on your brain and body.</p>
<p>Now, the third bullet point to understand</p>
<p>about the physics of light</p>
<p>is that different wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>because of the way that their wave travels</p>
<p>can penetrate tissues to different depths.</p>
<p>This is very, very important.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about red light therapies</p>
<p>and near infrared light therapies.</p>
<p>Those are so-called longer wavelengths.</p>
<p>Longer wavelength, just think of a bigger, longer wave,</p>
<p>right, a bigger curve,</p>
<p>as opposed to short wavelength light,</p>
<p>which is going to be shorter, right?</p>
<p>A short wavelength light would be something like blue</p>
<p>or green light or ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>Blue, green, and ultraviolet light,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s short wavelength light,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tend to penetrate tissues very easily.</p>
<p>It has to do with the way that the physics of light</p>
<p>interacts with the physical properties of your skin</p>
<p>and other tissues of your body.</p>
<p>But basically, if you were to shine UV light</p>
<p>onto your arm, for instance,</p>
<p>it could impact the skin on the surface of the arm</p>
<p>and maybe some of the cells</p>
<p>just beneath the top layer of skin,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t penetrate much deeper.</p>
<p>Long wavelength light, like red light</p>
<p>and near infrared light,</p>
<p>has this amazing ability to penetrate through tissues,</p>
<p>including your skin.</p>
<p>And so if we were to shine red light</p>
<p>or near infrared light onto your arm,</p>
<p>it would pass through that top layer of skin.</p>
<p>It might impact it a little bit,</p>
<p>but it could penetrate deeper into your skin,</p>
<p>not just to the skin layers,</p>
<p>but maybe even down to the bone,</p>
<p>maybe even down to the bone marrow.</p>
<p>And for many people,</p>
<p>this will be hard to conceptualize.</p>
<p>You think, well, wait, I&rsquo;ve got a skin there.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the light just bounce off?</p>
<p>And the answer is no,</p>
<p>because of the way that long wavelength light</p>
<p>interacts with the absorbance properties of your skin.</p>
<p>Absorbance properties is just the way</p>
<p>that the skin takes light energy</p>
<p>and converts it into a different form of energy.</p>
<p>And your skin is not able to take long wavelength light,</p>
<p>like red light and near infrared light, and absorb it,</p>
<p>but the tissues deeper in your body can.</p>
<p>So if you shine red light or near infrared light</p>
<p>onto the surface of your skin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a red glow there</p>
<p>as a reflectance on the surface of your skin.</p>
<p>But a lot of the photon energy,</p>
<p>the light energy in those longer wavelengths</p>
<p>is indeed passing through those top layers of skin</p>
<p>into the deeper layers of skin,</p>
<p>and can even make it into the deep layers of your arm.</p>
<p>And as we start to transition from the physics of light</p>
<p>to the biological impacts of light,</p>
<p>just understanding that the different wavelengths of light</p>
<p>impact our tissues at different levels,</p>
<p>literally at different depths,</p>
<p>will help you better understand</p>
<p>how light of different colors, of different intensities,</p>
<p>and how long you&rsquo;re exposed to those colors</p>
<p>and intensities of light can change the way</p>
<p>that the cells and the organs of your body work.</p>
<p>And if it didn&rsquo;t sound weird enough</p>
<p>that you can pass light through particular tissues</p>
<p>and have them land and be absorbed</p>
<p>at tissues deeper in your body,</p>
<p>well, it turns out that different wavelengths of light</p>
<p>are also best absorbed by particular</p>
<p>so-called organelles within your cells.</p>
<p>What are organelles?</p>
<p>Organelles are the different compartments</p>
<p>and different functions within a given cell.</p>
<p>So for instance, your mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are responsible for generating ATP</p>
<p>and energy in your cells.</p>
<p>Those exist at a particular depth,</p>
<p>at a particular location within a cell.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all at the cell surface,</p>
<p>they sit somewhat deeper in the cell.</p>
<p>The nucleus of your individual cells contains DNA,</p>
<p>and that sits at a particular depth</p>
<p>or location within your cell.</p>
<p>Different wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>not only can penetrate down into different tissues</p>
<p>and into different cells of your body,</p>
<p>but they can also penetrate and access</p>
<p>particular organelles, meaning mitochondria,</p>
<p>or the nucleus, or the different aspects of your cells</p>
<p>that are responsible for different functions.</p>
<p>This is exquisitely important,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s exquisitely powerful,</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;ll learn today,</p>
<p>particular wavelengths of light can be used</p>
<p>to stimulate the function of particular organelles</p>
<p>within particular cells,</p>
<p>within particular organs of your body.</p>
<p>I can think of no other form of energy,</p>
<p>not sound, not chemical energy, so not drugs,</p>
<p>not food, not touch,</p>
<p>no form of energy that can target</p>
<p>the particular locations in our cells,</p>
<p>in our organelles, in our organs, and in our body,</p>
<p>to the extent that light can.</p>
<p>In other words, if you had to imagine</p>
<p>a real-world surgical tool</p>
<p>by which to modulate our biology,</p>
<p>light would be the sharpest</p>
<p>and the most precise of those tools.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about how light is converted</p>
<p>into biological signals.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which that is accomplished,</p>
<p>but the fundamental thing to understand</p>
<p>is this notion of absorption of light energy.</p>
<p>Certain pigments or colors</p>
<p>in the thing that is receiving the light energy,</p>
<p>meaning the thing that the light energy lands on,</p>
<p>are going to absorb particular wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>Now, I promise you</p>
<p>that you already intuitively know how this works.</p>
<p>For instance, if you were to sit outside</p>
<p>on a very bright, sunny day,</p>
<p>and you had a table in front of you that was metal,</p>
<p>you might find it hard to look down at that metal table,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s reflecting a lot of light</p>
<p>of particular wavelengths.</p>
<p>If that table were pitch black, however,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t reflect quite as much,</p>
<p>and you would be able to comfortably look at it.</p>
<p>If that table were red, it might be somewhere in between.</p>
<p>If that table were green,</p>
<p>it would be also somewhere in between.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say it were very light blue.</p>
<p>Well, then it might reflect almost as much</p>
<p>as a table that were just metal or a white table surface.</p>
<p>So the absorbance properties of a given surface</p>
<p>will determine whether or not light energy goes</p>
<p>and stays at that location</p>
<p>and has an impact on that location,</p>
<p>or whether or not it bounces off.</p>
<p>Every biological function of light</p>
<p>has to do with the absorbance or the reflectance of light</p>
<p>or light passing through that particular thing,</p>
<p>meaning that particular cell or compartment within a cell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make it clear how this works</p>
<p>by using the three primary examples</p>
<p>of how you take light in your environment</p>
<p>and convert it into biological events.</p>
<p>We have photoreceptors in the back of our eyes.</p>
<p>These photoreceptors come in two major types,</p>
<p>the so-called rods and the cones.</p>
<p>The rods are very elongated.</p>
<p>They look like rods,</p>
<p>and the cones look like little triangles.</p>
<p>Rods and cones have within them photopigment.</p>
<p>They have dark stuff that&rsquo;s stacked up in little layers.</p>
<p>Rods absorb light of essentially any wavelength.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some variation to that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say rods don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about the different colors of light.</p>
<p>They will absorb light energy, photon energy.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s red, if it&rsquo;s green, if it&rsquo;s blue, if it&rsquo;s yellow,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as that light is bright enough.</p>
<p>And it turns out that rods are very, very sensitive.</p>
<p>They can detect very, very small numbers of photons.</p>
<p>And rods are essentially what you use to see</p>
<p>in very low light conditions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return more to vision later.</p>
<p>The cones come in three major varieties,</p>
<p>at least for most people who aren&rsquo;t colorblind.</p>
<p>You have so-called red cones, green cones, and blue cones,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not really red, green, and blue</p>
<p>in the back of your eye.</p>
<p>They are cones that either absorb long wavelength light,</p>
<p>red, that absorb medium wavelength light, green,</p>
<p>or short wavelength light, blue.</p>
<p>The reason that they can absorb</p>
<p>different wavelengths of light</p>
<p>is they have different photo pigments.</p>
<p>So much as the example I gave before,</p>
<p>where you have different tables outside</p>
<p>in the sunny environment,</p>
<p>and some are reflecting light more than others,</p>
<p>others are absorbing light more than others.</p>
<p>Well, so too, the photoreceptors, meaning the cones,</p>
<p>are absorbing light of different wavelengths</p>
<p>to different extents.</p>
<p>And in a absolutely incredible way,</p>
<p>your brain is actually able to take that information</p>
<p>and create this perception that we have of color.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another story altogether</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll just touch on a little bit more later,</p>
<p>but that if you want to learn all about,</p>
<p>you can go to our episode on vision.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s photoreceptors in the back of your eye</p>
<p>absorbing light of different wavelengths, rods and cones.</p>
<p>The other place, of course,</p>
<p>where light can impact our body is on our surface,</p>
<p>on our skin, and skin has pigment too.</p>
<p>We call that pigment melanin.</p>
<p>We have within our skin multiple cell types,</p>
<p>but in the top layer of skin,</p>
<p>which is called the epidermis,</p>
<p>we have keratinocytes and we have melanocytes.</p>
<p>And the melanocytes are the cells</p>
<p>that create pigmentation of the skin.</p>
<p>And of course, there is wide variation</p>
<p>in the degree to which there&rsquo;s pigmentation of the skin,</p>
<p>which has to do with genetics,</p>
<p>also has to do with where you were born and raised,</p>
<p>how much light exposure you have throughout the year, right?</p>
<p>So people toward the equator</p>
<p>tend to have more melanocyte activity</p>
<p>than people who are located at the North Pole.</p>
<p>And of course, people live at different locations</p>
<p>throughout the earth, regardless of their genetic background</p>
<p>or where they were born.</p>
<p>And so, as you all know, with light exposure,</p>
<p>those melanocytes will turn on genetic programs</p>
<p>and other biological programs</p>
<p>that lead to enhanced pigmentation of the skin,</p>
<p>which we call tanning.</p>
<p>The way they do that is by absorbing UV light specifically.</p>
<p>So with melanocytes, we have a very specific example</p>
<p>of how a pigment absorbs light of a particular length,</p>
<p>in this case, ultraviolet short wavelength light,</p>
<p>which in turn creates a set of biological signals</p>
<p>within those cells that in turn</p>
<p>creates changes in our skin pigmentation.</p>
<p>So we have photoreceptors, we have melanocytes.</p>
<p>And the third example I&rsquo;d like to provide</p>
<p>is that of every cell of your body.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is that every cell of your body,</p>
<p>meaning a cell that is part of your bone tissue</p>
<p>or your bone marrow or heart tissue or liver or spleen,</p>
<p>if light can access those cells,</p>
<p>it will change the way that those cells function</p>
<p>for better or for worse.</p>
<p>For many organs within our body</p>
<p>that reside deep to our skin,</p>
<p>light never arrives at those cells.</p>
<p>A really good example of this that we&rsquo;ll touch on later</p>
<p>is the spleen.</p>
<p>Unless you have massive damage to your body surface,</p>
<p>unless you literally have a hole in your body,</p>
<p>light will never land directly on your spleen.</p>
<p>But the spleen still responds to light information</p>
<p>through indirect pathways.</p>
<p>And those indirect pathways arise</p>
<p>through light arriving on the skin</p>
<p>and light arriving on the eyes.</p>
<p>So a key principle that I&rsquo;m going to return to again</p>
<p>and again today is that the ways in which light</p>
<p>can impact the biology of your organelles, your cells,</p>
<p>your organs and the tissues and indeed your whole body</p>
<p>can either be direct.</p>
<p>So for instance, light onto your skin impacting skin</p>
<p>or light onto your photoreceptors</p>
<p>impacting the photoreceptors of your eye,</p>
<p>or it can be indirect.</p>
<p>It can be light arriving on your photoreceptors,</p>
<p>the photoreceptors then informing another cell type,</p>
<p>which informs another cell type,</p>
<p>which then relays a signal in kind of a bucket brigade</p>
<p>manner off to the spleen and says to the spleen,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a lot of UV light out here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually under stress.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s so much UV light that you need to activate</p>
<p>an immune program to protect the skin.</p>
<p>And in response to that,</p>
<p>the spleen can deploy certain signals in certain cell types</p>
<p>to go out and start repairing skin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being damaged by UV light.</p>
<p>So we have direct signals and we have indirect signals,</p>
<p>but in every case,</p>
<p>it starts with light of particular wavelengths</p>
<p>being absorbed by particular pigments</p>
<p>or properties of the surfaces</p>
<p>that those light waves land on.</p>
<p>And as you recall from our discussion</p>
<p>about the physics of light,</p>
<p>remember it&rsquo;s not just about light impinging</p>
<p>on the surface of your body.</p>
<p>Light can actually penetrate deep to the skin</p>
<p>and access at least certain tissues and cells of your body.</p>
<p>Even though you can&rsquo;t see those wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>they are getting into you all the time.</p>
<p>So perhaps the best way to wrap this discussion</p>
<p>about the physics and the biology of light</p>
<p>with a bit of a bow is to think about light as a transducer,</p>
<p>meaning a communicator of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the environment around you.</p>
<p>And that some of those signals are arriving at the surface</p>
<p>and impacting the surface of your body.</p>
<p>But many of those signals are being taken by cells</p>
<p>at the surface of your body,</p>
<p>meaning your melanocytes in your skin</p>
<p>and the photoreceptors of your eyes,</p>
<p>and then being passed off as a set of instructions</p>
<p>to the other organs and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>Light can impact our biology in very fast,</p>
<p>moderately fast and slow ways.</p>
<p>But even the slow ways in which light can impact our biology</p>
<p>can be very powerful and very long lasting.</p>
<p>Just as a quick example of the rapid effects of light</p>
<p>on our biology.</p>
<p>If you were to go from a room that is dimly lit or dark</p>
<p>into a very brightly lit room,</p>
<p>you would immediately feel very alert.</p>
<p>You might say, no, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake up and it&rsquo;s dark and I kind of stumble out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s lighter out in the next room</p>
<p>and it takes me a while to wake up.</p>
<p>But if we were to move you from a room that was very dark</p>
<p>to very bright, a signal conveyed from your eyes</p>
<p>to an area of your brainstem called the locus coeruleus</p>
<p>would cause the release of adrenaline,</p>
<p>similar to the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>if you were to be dropped into very, very cold water</p>
<p>all of a sudden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an immediate wake up signal</p>
<p>to your brain and body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an example of a rapid effect of light</p>
<p>on your biology.</p>
<p>Not a very typical one, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>one that has a hardwired biological mechanism.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum are what we call</p>
<p>slow integrating effects of light on our biology.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that are ways in which your body</p>
<p>is taking information about light in the environment,</p>
<p>not in the sort of snapshot acute sense,</p>
<p>but averaging the amount of light in your environment.</p>
<p>And that average light information is changing the way</p>
<p>that your biology works.</p>
<p>But even though this is a slow process,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, it&rsquo;s a very powerful one.</p>
<p>The primary example of this are so-called</p>
<p>circanual rhythms.</p>
<p>Circanual rhythms are literally a calendar</p>
<p>that exists within your body that uses not numbers,</p>
<p>but amounts of hormone that are released</p>
<p>into your brain and body each day and each night</p>
<p>as a way of knowing where you are</p>
<p>in the 365 day calendar year.</p>
<p>Now that might seem kind of crazy, but it&rsquo;s not crazy.</p>
<p>The earth travels around the sun once every 365 days.</p>
<p>And depending on where you are on the earth,</p>
<p>where you live, you are going to get more or less light</p>
<p>each day on average, depending on the time of year.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the Northern hemisphere</p>
<p>in the winter months, days are shorter, nights are longer.</p>
<p>In the summer months, days are longer, nights are shorter.</p>
<p>And of course things change whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the Northern hemisphere</p>
<p>or the Southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, in short days, you have more darkness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>And if you understand that light arriving on the eyes</p>
<p>is absorbed by a particular cell type</p>
<p>called the intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a name.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the name, but if you want,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the so-called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell</p>
<p>also called the melanopsin cell</p>
<p>because it contains an opsin, a photo pigment</p>
<p>that absorbs short wavelength light</p>
<p>that arrives through sunlight.</p>
<p>Those cells communicate to particular stations in the brain</p>
<p>that in turn connect to your so-called pineal gland,</p>
<p>which is this little pea-sized gland</p>
<p>in the middle of your brain that releases a hormone</p>
<p>called melatonin.</p>
<p>And the only thing you need to know</p>
<p>is that light activates these particular cells,</p>
<p>the intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>which in turn shuts down the production of melatonin</p>
<p>from the pineal gland.</p>
<p>If you think about this in terms of the travel of the earth</p>
<p>around the sun across the year,</p>
<p>what it means is that in short days,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very little light on average</p>
<p>landing on these cells,</p>
<p>the duration of melatonin release will be much longer</p>
<p>because as I mentioned before, light inhibits,</p>
<p>it shuts down melatonin.</p>
<p>Whereas in the summer months,</p>
<p>much more light on average will land on your eyes, right?</p>
<p>Because days are longer,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re spending more time indoors,</p>
<p>on average, you&rsquo;re going to get more light</p>
<p>to activate these cells.</p>
<p>And because light shuts down melatonin production,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that the duration of melatonin release</p>
<p>for the pineal is much shorter.</p>
<p>So melatonin is a transducer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a communicator of how much light on average</p>
<p>is in your physical environment.</p>
<p>What this means is for people living</p>
<p>in the Northern hemisphere,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting more melatonin release in the winter months</p>
<p>than you are in the summer months.</p>
<p>So you have a calendar system that is based in a hormone</p>
<p>and that hormone is using light</p>
<p>in order to determine where you are</p>
<p>in that journey around the sun.</p>
<p>Now, this is beautiful.</p>
<p>At least to me, it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>because what it means is that the environment around us</p>
<p>is converted into a signal</p>
<p>that changes the environment within us.</p>
<p>That signal is melatonin.</p>
<p>And melatonin is well-known for its role</p>
<p>in making us sleepy each night</p>
<p>and allowing us to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard before,</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of melatonin supplementation</p>
<p>for a number of reasons, but just as a quick aside,</p>
<p>the levels of melatonin that are in most supplements</p>
<p>are far too high to really be considered physiological.</p>
<p>They are indeed super physiological in most cases.</p>
<p>And melatonin can have a number of different effects,</p>
<p>not just related to sleep,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s supplemented melatonin.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m talking about our natural production</p>
<p>and release of melatonin</p>
<p>according to where we are in the 365-day calendar year.</p>
<p>Endogenous melatonin,</p>
<p>meaning the melatonin that we make</p>
<p>within our bodies naturally,</p>
<p>not melatonin that&rsquo;s supplemented,</p>
<p>has two general categories of effects.</p>
<p>The first set of effects are so-called regulatory effects,</p>
<p>and the others are protective effects.</p>
<p>The regulatory effects are, for instance,</p>
<p>that melatonin can positively impact bone mass.</p>
<p>So melatonin can, for instance,</p>
<p>turn on the production of osteoblasts,</p>
<p>which are essentially stem cells</p>
<p>that make more bone for us,</p>
<p>that make our bones stronger</p>
<p>and that can replace damaged aspects of our bone.</p>
<p>Melatonin is also involved in maturation of the gonads</p>
<p>during puberty, the ovaries and the testes.</p>
<p>Although there, the effects of melatonin</p>
<p>tend to be suppressive on maturation</p>
<p>of the ovaries and testes,</p>
<p>meaning high levels of melatonin</p>
<p>tend to reduce testicle volume</p>
<p>and reduce certain functions within the testes,</p>
<p>including sperm production and testosterone production.</p>
<p>And within the ovaries,</p>
<p>melatonin can suppress the maturation of eggs, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to get scared</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been taking melatonin.</p>
<p>Most of the effects of melatonin on those functions</p>
<p>are reversible, but I should point out</p>
<p>that one of the reasons why children</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go into puberty until a particular age</p>
<p>is that young children tend to have</p>
<p>chronically high endogenous melatonin,</p>
<p>and that is healthy to keep them out of puberty</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s the right time for puberty to happen.</p>
<p>So melatonin can increase bone mass,</p>
<p>but reduces gonad mass, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have varying effects</p>
<p>depending on the ratios and levels of other hormones</p>
<p>and other biological events in the body.</p>
<p>But as you can see,</p>
<p>melatonin has these powerful regulatory effects</p>
<p>on other tissues.</p>
<p>I should also mention that melatonin</p>
<p>is a powerful modulator of placental development.</p>
<p>So for anyone that&rsquo;s pregnant,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re considering melatonin supplementation,</p>
<p>please, please, please talk to your OBGYN,</p>
<p>talk to your other doctor as well.</p>
<p>You want to be very, very cautious</p>
<p>because of the powerful effects that melatonin can have</p>
<p>on the developing fetus and placenta.</p>
<p>For people that are not pregnant,</p>
<p>in fact, all people,</p>
<p>melatonin has a powerful effect</p>
<p>on the central nervous system as a whole.</p>
<p>Your brain and spinal cord are the major components</p>
<p>of your central nervous system.</p>
<p>And melatonin, because it&rsquo;s associated with darkness,</p>
<p>which is just another way of saying</p>
<p>that light suppresses melatonin,</p>
<p>melatonin is thereby associated</p>
<p>with the dark phase of each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>It can have a number of different effects</p>
<p>in terms of waking up or making our body feel more sleepy.</p>
<p>And it does that by way of impacting cells</p>
<p>within our nervous system,</p>
<p>literally turning on certain brain areas,</p>
<p>turning off other brain areas.</p>
<p>And it does that</p>
<p>through a whole cascade of biological mechanisms,</p>
<p>a bit too detailed to get into today.</p>
<p>So melatonin is regulating how awake or asleep we are.</p>
<p>It tends to make us more asleep incidentally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s regulating our timing of puberty</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s regulating how our gonads,</p>
<p>the testes and ovaries function,</p>
<p>even in adulthood to some extent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s regulating bone mass.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>melatonin also has protective effects.</p>
<p>It can activate our immune system.</p>
<p>It is among the most potent antioxidants.</p>
<p>So it is known to have certain anti-cancer properties</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>which is not to say that you simply want more melatonin.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people get misled</p>
<p>when they hear something</p>
<p>like melatonin has anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that just cranking up the levels</p>
<p>of melatonin by supplementing it</p>
<p>or by spending time in darkness and not getting any light,</p>
<p>which would of course inhibit melatonin,</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial for combating cancer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way it works.</p>
<p>It is actually the rise and fall of melatonin</p>
<p>every 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>And the changes in the duration of that melatonin signal</p>
<p>throughout the seasons</p>
<p>that has these anti-cancer and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>So when we think about light impacting our biology,</p>
<p>the reason I bring up melatonin</p>
<p>as the primary example of that</p>
<p>is A, because melatonin impacts</p>
<p>so many important functions within our brain and body,</p>
<p>but also because hormones in general, not always,</p>
<p>but in general are responsible</p>
<p>for these slow modulatory effects on our biology.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m using this as an example</p>
<p>of how light throughout the year</p>
<p>is changing the way that the different cells and tissues</p>
<p>and organs of your body are working</p>
<p>and that melatonin is the transducer of that signal.</p>
<p>So at this point we can say</p>
<p>light powerfully modulates melatonin,</p>
<p>meaning it shuts down melatonin.</p>
<p>Melatonin is both beneficial for certain tissues</p>
<p>and suppressive for other tissues and functions.</p>
<p>What should we do with this information?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very well established now</p>
<p>that one of the best things that we can all do</p>
<p>is to get the proper amount of sunlight each day.</p>
<p>And by proper, I mean appropriate for that time of year.</p>
<p>So in the summer months where the days are longer</p>
<p>and nights are shorter,</p>
<p>we would all do well to get more sunlight in our eyes.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s going to be to our eyes</p>
<p>because as you recall, the pineal sits deep in the brain</p>
<p>and light can&rsquo;t access the pineal directly,</p>
<p>at least not in humans.</p>
<p>So in order to get light information to the pineal</p>
<p>and thereby get the proper levels of melatonin,</p>
<p>according to the time of year,</p>
<p>we should all try and get outside as much as possible</p>
<p>during the long days of summer and spring.</p>
<p>And in the winter months,</p>
<p>it makes sense to spend more time indoors.</p>
<p>For those of you that suffer</p>
<p>from seasonal affective disorder,</p>
<p>which is a seasonal depression</p>
<p>or feel low during the fall and winter months,</p>
<p>there are ways to offset this.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on mood and circadian rhythms</p>
<p>where we described this.</p>
<p>So it does make sense for some people</p>
<p>to get more bright light in their eyes early in the morning</p>
<p>and throughout the day during the winter months as well.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, changes in melatonin,</p>
<p>meaning changes in the duration of melatonin release</p>
<p>across the year are normal and healthy.</p>
<p>So provided that you&rsquo;re not suffering from depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be healthy to somewhat modulate your amount</p>
<p>of indoor and outdoor time across the year.</p>
<p>The other thing to understand</p>
<p>is this very firmly established fact,</p>
<p>which is light powerfully inhibits melatonin.</p>
<p>If you wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and you go into the bathroom</p>
<p>and you flip on the lights</p>
<p>and those are very bright overhead fluorescent lights,</p>
<p>your melatonin levels,</p>
<p>which would ordinarily be quite high</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve been eyes closed in the dark, presumably,</p>
<p>will immediately plummet to near zero or zero.</p>
<p>We would all do well, regardless of time of year,</p>
<p>to not destroy our melatonin</p>
<p>in the middle of the night in this way.</p>
<p>So if you need to get up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and use the restroom,</p>
<p>which is a perfectly normal behavior for many people,</p>
<p>use the minimum amount of light required</p>
<p>in order to safely move through the environment</p>
<p>that you need to move through.</p>
<p>Melatonin needs to come on early in the night.</p>
<p>It actually starts rising in the evening and towards sleep.</p>
<p>But then as you close your eyes and you go to sleep,</p>
<p>melatonin levels are going to continue to rise,</p>
<p>at least for several hours into the night.</p>
<p>Again, if you get up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>really try hard not to flip on a lot of bright lights.</p>
<p>If you do that every once in a while,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be a problem.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing that night after night,</p>
<p>you are really disrupting this fundamental signal</p>
<p>that occurs every night,</p>
<p>regardless of winter, spring, summer, et cetera,</p>
<p>and that is communicating information</p>
<p>about where your brain and body should be in time.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s a little bit of a tricky concept,</p>
<p>but really our body is not meant to function</p>
<p>in the same way during the winter months</p>
<p>as the summer months.</p>
<p>There are functions that are specifically optimal</p>
<p>for the shorter days of winter,</p>
<p>and there are functions that are specifically optimal</p>
<p>for the longer days of summer.</p>
<p>So again, try to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are doing shift work,</p>
<p>what I can say is try and avoid getting bright light</p>
<p>in your eyes in the middle of your sleep cycle.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re sleeping in the middle of the day</p>
<p>because you have to work at night,</p>
<p>if you wake up during that bout of sleep,</p>
<p>really try hard to limit the amount of light,</p>
<p>which is going to be harder for shift workers, right?</p>
<p>Because there are generally a lot more lights on</p>
<p>than bright lights outside to you.</p>
<p>You would want to close the blinds</p>
<p>and limit artificial light inside.</p>
<p>One way to bypass some of the inhibitory effects of light</p>
<p>on melatonin is to change your physical environment</p>
<p>by, for instance, dimming the lights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one simple way, very low cost way.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;ll save money by dimming the lights</p>
<p>or turning them off.</p>
<p>The other is if you are going to use light</p>
<p>using long wavelength light, because as you recall,</p>
<p>these intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells</p>
<p>within your retina that convey the signal</p>
<p>about bright light in your environment to impact melatonin,</p>
<p>to shut down melatonin,</p>
<p>respond to short wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>So red light is long wavelength light.</p>
<p>You now understand that from our discussion</p>
<p>about the physics of light.</p>
<p>And if you were to use amber colored light or red light</p>
<p>and even better dim amber or dim red light</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>well then you would probably not reduce melatonin at all,</p>
<p>unless those red lights and amber lights</p>
<p>are very, very bright.</p>
<p>Any light provided it&rsquo;s bright enough</p>
<p>will shut down melatonin production.</p>
<p>One final point about melatonin,</p>
<p>and this relates to melatonin supplementation as well,</p>
<p>is that now that you understand how potently melatonin</p>
<p>can impact things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>immune function, anti-cancer properties, bone mass,</p>
<p>gonad function, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can understand why it would make sense to be cautious</p>
<p>about melatonin supplementation,</p>
<p>because supplementation tends to be pretty static.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s X number of milligrams per night.</p>
<p>Whereas normally, endogenously,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin that you&rsquo;re releasing each night</p>
<p>is changing according to time of year.</p>
<p>Or if you happen to live in an area</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t much change in day length across the year,</p>
<p>so for instance, if you live near the equator,</p>
<p>well, then your body is accustomed</p>
<p>to having regular amounts of melatonin each night.</p>
<p>When you start supplementing melatonin,</p>
<p>you start changing the total amount of melatonin, obviously,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also changing the normal rhythms</p>
<p>in how much melatonin is being released</p>
<p>into your brain and body across the 365-day calendar year.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m somebody who readily embraces supplementation</p>
<p>in various forms for things like sleep and focus, et cetera,</p>
<p>when it comes to melatonin, I&rsquo;m extremely cautious.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s also one of the few examples</p>
<p>where a hormone is available without prescription</p>
<p>over-the-counter.</p>
<p>You can just go into a pharmacy or drugstore,</p>
<p>order online this hormone,</p>
<p>which is known to have all these powerful effects.</p>
<p>So I get very, very concerned</p>
<p>when I hear about people taking melatonin,</p>
<p>especially at the levels that are present</p>
<p>in most supplements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been recognized for a very long time,</p>
<p>and in fact, there are now data to support the fact</p>
<p>that animals of all kinds, including humans,</p>
<p>will seek out mates and engage in mating behavior</p>
<p>more frequently during the long days of spring and summer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In seasonally breeding animals, of course this is the case,</p>
<p>but in humans as well,</p>
<p>there is more seeking out of mates and mating behavior</p>
<p>in longer day times of year.</p>
<p>Now you could imagine at least two mechanisms</p>
<p>by which this occurs.</p>
<p>The first mechanism we could easily map to melatonin</p>
<p>and the fact that melatonin is suppressive</p>
<p>to various aspects of the so-called gonadal axis,</p>
<p>which is basically a fancy way of saying</p>
<p>that melatonin inhibits testosterone and estrogen output</p>
<p>from the testes and from the ovaries.</p>
<p>I just want to remind people that both males and females</p>
<p>make testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>although in different ratios,</p>
<p>typically in males versus females,</p>
<p>and that both testosterone and estrogen are critical</p>
<p>for the desire to mate and for mating behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a broad misconception</p>
<p>that testosterone is involved in mating behavior</p>
<p>and estrogen is involved in other behaviors,</p>
<p>but having enough estrogen is critical</p>
<p>for both males and females in order to maintain</p>
<p>the desire to mate and indeed the ability to mate.</p>
<p>I discussed this on the episode</p>
<p>on optimizing testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;d like more details on that,</p>
<p>please see that episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Okay, so if melatonin is suppressive</p>
<p>to the so-called gonadal axis</p>
<p>and reduces overall levels of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in males and females, and light inhibits melatonin,</p>
<p>then when there&rsquo;s more light, then there&rsquo;s less melatonin</p>
<p>and more hormone output from the gonads.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s how the system works,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the entire story.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a second</p>
<p>so-called parallel pathway,</p>
<p>meaning a different biological pathway</p>
<p>that operates in parallel to the light suppression</p>
<p>of melatonin pathway that provides a basis</p>
<p>for longer days inspiring more desire to mate</p>
<p>and more mating behavior.</p>
<p>So if we think of the first pathway involving melatonin</p>
<p>as sort of a break on these reproductive hormones,</p>
<p>the second mechanism is more like an accelerator</p>
<p>on those hormones, and yet it still involves light.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m about to tell you, in animals such as mice,</p>
<p>but also in humans, exposure to light,</p>
<p>in particular UV blue light, so short wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>can trigger increases in testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and the desire to mate.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s especially important about this accelerator</p>
<p>on the desire to mate and mating behavior and hormones</p>
<p>is that it is driven by exposure to light,</p>
<p>but it is not the exposure of light to the eyes.</p>
<p>It turns out that it is the exposure of your skin</p>
<p>to particular wavelengths of light</p>
<p>that is triggering increases in the hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>leading to increased desire to mate.</p>
<p>As it turns out, your skin,</p>
<p>which most of us just think of as a way</p>
<p>to protect the organs of our body</p>
<p>or something to hang clothes on or ornaments on</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who has earrings and so forth,</p>
<p>your skin is actually an endocrine organ,</p>
<p>meaning it is a hormone producing</p>
<p>and hormone influencing organ.</p>
<p>I promise what I&rsquo;m about to tell you next</p>
<p>will forever change the way that you think about your skin</p>
<p>and light and the desire to mate</p>
<p>and indeed even mating behavior.</p>
<p>I think the results are best understood</p>
<p>by simply going through the primary data,</p>
<p>meaning the actual research on this topic.</p>
<p>And to do so, I&rsquo;m going to review a recent paper</p>
<p>that was published in the journal Cell Reports,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>This is a paper that came out in 2021</p>
<p>entitled Skin Exposure to UVB Light</p>
<p>Induces a Skin-Brain-Gonad Axis and Sexual Behavior.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that this was a paper</p>
<p>that focused on mice in order to address</p>
<p>specific mechanisms because in mice,</p>
<p>you can so-called knock out particular genes,</p>
<p>you can remove particular genes to understand mechanism.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t do that in humans</p>
<p>in any kind of controlled way,</p>
<p>at least not at this point in time.</p>
<p>And this study also explores humans</p>
<p>and looked at human subjects, both men and women.</p>
<p>The basic finding of this study was that</p>
<p>when mice or humans were exposed to UVB,</p>
<p>meaning ultraviolet blue light,</p>
<p>so short wavelength light of the sort</p>
<p>that comes through in sunshine,</p>
<p>but is also available through various artificial sources.</p>
<p>If they received enough exposure</p>
<p>of that light to their skin,</p>
<p>there were increases in testosterone</p>
<p>that were observed within a very brief period of time,</p>
<p>also increases in the hormone estrogen.</p>
<p>And I should point out that the proper ratios</p>
<p>of estrogen and testosterone were maintained</p>
<p>in both males and females,</p>
<p>at least as far as these data indicate.</p>
<p>And mice tended to seek out mating more and mate more.</p>
<p>There were also increases in gonadal weight,</p>
<p>literally increases in testes size and in ovarian size</p>
<p>when mice were exposed to this UVB light</p>
<p>past a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned before, the study also looked at humans.</p>
<p>They did not look at testes size</p>
<p>or ovarian size in the human subjects.</p>
<p>However, because they are humans,</p>
<p>they did address the psychology of these human beings</p>
<p>and address whether or not they had increases in,</p>
<p>for instance, aggressiveness or impassionate feelings</p>
<p>and how their perception of other people changed</p>
<p>when they were getting a lot of UVB light exposure</p>
<p>to the skin.</p>
<p>So before I get into some of the more important details</p>
<p>of the study and how it was done</p>
<p>and how you can leverage this information for yourself,</p>
<p>if you desire, I just want to highlight</p>
<p>some of the basic findings overall.</p>
<p>UVB exposure increased these so-called sex steroid levels</p>
<p>in mice and humans.</p>
<p>The sex steroid hormones, when we say steroids,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t mean anabolic steroids taken exogenously.</p>
<p>I think when people hear the word steroids,</p>
<p>they always think steroid abuse or use,</p>
<p>rather steroid hormones such as testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>went up when mice or humans had a lot of UVB exposure</p>
<p>to their skin.</p>
<p>Second of all, UVB light exposure to the skin</p>
<p>enhanced female attractiveness.</p>
<p>So the perceived attractiveness of females by males</p>
<p>and increase the receptiveness or the desire to mate</p>
<p>in both sexes.</p>
<p>UVB light exposure also changed various aspects</p>
<p>of female biology related to fertility,</p>
<p>in particular, follicle growth.</p>
<p>Follicle and egg maturation are well-known indices</p>
<p>of fertility and of course correlate</p>
<p>with the menstrual cycle in adult humans</p>
<p>and is related overall to the propensity to become pregnant.</p>
<p>UVB light exposure enhanced maturation of the follicle,</p>
<p>which just meant that more healthy eggs were being produced.</p>
<p>These are impressive effects.</p>
<p>First of all, they looked at a large number of variables</p>
<p>in the study and the fact that they looked at mice</p>
<p>and humans is terrific.</p>
<p>I think that oftentimes we find it hard to translate data</p>
<p>from mice to humans.</p>
<p>So the fact that they looked at both in parallel</p>
<p>is wonderful.</p>
<p>In the mice and in the humans,</p>
<p>they established a protocol that essentially involved</p>
<p>exposing the skin to UV light that was equivalent</p>
<p>to about 20 to 30 minutes of midday sun exposure.</p>
<p>Now, of course, where you live in the world</p>
<p>will dictate whether or not that midday sun</p>
<p>is very, very bright and intense or is less bright.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s cloud cover, et cetera.</p>
<p>But since I&rsquo;m imagining that most people are interested</p>
<p>in ways to increase testosterone and or estrogen</p>
<p>in humans and are not so much interested</p>
<p>in increasing testosterone in mice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just review what they did</p>
<p>in the human population or the human subjects.</p>
<p>What they did is they had people,</p>
<p>first of all, establish a baseline.</p>
<p>And the way they establish a baseline</p>
<p>was a little bit unusual,</p>
<p>but it will make perfect sense to you.</p>
<p>They had people wear long sleeves and essentially cover up</p>
<p>and avoid sunlight for a few days</p>
<p>so they could measure their baseline hormones</p>
<p>in the absence of getting a lot of UVB light exposure</p>
<p>from the sun or from other sources.</p>
<p>Now, of course, these people had access</p>
<p>to artificial lights,</p>
<p>but as I&rsquo;ve pointed out on this podcast before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty unusual that you&rsquo;ll get enough UVB exposure</p>
<p>from artificial lights throughout the day.</p>
<p>And in the morning, you need a lot of UVB exposure,</p>
<p>or we should be getting a lot of UVB exposure</p>
<p>to our eyes and to our face and to our skin</p>
<p>throughout the day, provided we&rsquo;re not getting sunburned.</p>
<p>This is actually a healthy thing for mood</p>
<p>and for energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only at night, basically between the hours</p>
<p>of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>that even a tiny bit of UVB exposure</p>
<p>from artificial sources can mess us up</p>
<p>in terms of our sleep and our energy levels and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the potent effect of UVB</p>
<p>on suppressing melatonin.</p>
<p>So the point here is that they establish a baseline</p>
<p>whereby people were getting some artificial light exposure</p>
<p>throughout the day, but they weren&rsquo;t getting outside a lot.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t getting a lot of sunlight.</p>
<p>And then they had people receive a dose</p>
<p>of UVB light exposure</p>
<p>that was about 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.</p>
<p>They had people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.</p>
<p>Some people wore sleeveless shirts.</p>
<p>They encouraged people to wear shorts.</p>
<p>So they were indeed wearing clothing.</p>
<p>They were not naked and they were wearing clothing</p>
<p>that was culturally and situationally appropriate,</p>
<p>at least for the part of the world</p>
<p>where this study was done.</p>
<p>And they had people do that two or three times a week.</p>
<p>So in terms of a protocol that you might export</p>
<p>from this study, basically getting outside</p>
<p>for about 30 minutes, two or three times a week</p>
<p>in a minimum of clothing,</p>
<p>and yet still wearing enough clothing</p>
<p>that is culturally appropriate.</p>
<p>They were outside, they weren&rsquo;t sunbathing,</p>
<p>flipping over on their back and front.</p>
<p>They were just moving about doing things they could read,</p>
<p>they could talk, they could go about other activities,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t wearing a broad brim hat</p>
<p>or a hat of any kind.</p>
<p>Just getting a lot of sun exposure to their skin.</p>
<p>They did this for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.</p>
<p>So this took several weeks, right?</p>
<p>It took about a month if you think about it,</p>
<p>two or three times per week</p>
<p>for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.</p>
<p>These treatments, of course,</p>
<p>are just being outside in the sun.</p>
<p>And then they measured hormones</p>
<p>and they measured the psychology</p>
<p>of these male and female adult subjects.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first look at the psychological changes</p>
<p>that these human subjects experienced</p>
<p>after getting 10 to 12 of these UVB light exposure,</p>
<p>outdoor and sunlight type treatments.</p>
<p>They did this by collecting blood samples</p>
<p>throughout the study.</p>
<p>And they saw significant increases</p>
<p>in the hormones beta-estradiol,</p>
<p>which is one of the major forms of estrogen,</p>
<p>progesterone, another important steroid hormone,</p>
<p>and testosterone in both men and women.</p>
<p>Now, an important point is that the testosterone increases</p>
<p>were significantly higher in men</p>
<p>that happened to originate from countries</p>
<p>that had low UV exposure</p>
<p>compared to individuals from countries</p>
<p>with high UV exposure.</p>
<p>Now, this ought to make sense</p>
<p>if we understand a little bit</p>
<p>about how the skin functions as an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard of vitamin D3,</p>
<p>which is a vitamin that we all make.</p>
<p>Many people supplement it as well</p>
<p>if they need additional vitamin D3.</p>
<p>We all require sunlight in order to allow vitamin D3</p>
<p>to be synthesized and perform its roles in the body.</p>
<p>And it turns out that people who have darker skin</p>
<p>actually need more vitamin D3</p>
<p>and or more sunlight exposure</p>
<p>in order to activate that D3 pathway</p>
<p>than do people with paler skin.</p>
<p>And this should make sense to all of you</p>
<p>given what you now understand about melanocytes,</p>
<p>that cell type that we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>because melanocytes have pigment within them.</p>
<p>And if you have darker skin,</p>
<p>it means that you have more melanocytes</p>
<p>or that you have melanocytes</p>
<p>that are more efficient at creating pigment.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>the light that lands on your skin</p>
<p>will be absorbed by those melanocytes</p>
<p>and less of it is able to impact the D3 pathway.</p>
<p>Whereas if you have pale skin,</p>
<p>more of the light that lands on your skin</p>
<p>can trigger the synthesis</p>
<p>and assist the actions of vitamin D3.</p>
<p>Similarly, in this study,</p>
<p>they found that people who had paler skin</p>
<p>and or who originated from countries</p>
<p>where they had less UVB light exposure across the year</p>
<p>had greater, meaning more significant increases</p>
<p>in testosterone overall</p>
<p>than did people who already</p>
<p>were getting a lot of UVB exposure.</p>
<p>This led them to explore</p>
<p>so-called seasonal changes in testosterone</p>
<p>that occurred normally in the absence</p>
<p>of any light exposure treatment.</p>
<p>So up until now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about the aspects of this study</p>
<p>involving people getting outside</p>
<p>for about 20 to 30 minutes per day</p>
<p>in sunlight in a minimum of clothing.</p>
<p>There was an increase in testosterone observed</p>
<p>in both men and women.</p>
<p>The increases in testosterone were greater</p>
<p>for people that had paler skin than darker skin.</p>
<p>So the data I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>also come from this same paper,</p>
<p>but do not involve 20 to 30 minute</p>
<p>daily sun exposure protocols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply addressing whether or not</p>
<p>testosterone levels change as a function of time of year.</p>
<p>They measure testosterone across the 12 month calendar.</p>
<p>This study was done on subjects living</p>
<p>in the Northern hemisphere for the entire year.</p>
<p>And so in the months of January, February, and March,</p>
<p>of course, the length of days is shortest</p>
<p>and the length of nights is longest.</p>
<p>And of course, in the spring and summer months,</p>
<p>June, July, August, September, and so on,</p>
<p>the days are much longer and the nights are shorter.</p>
<p>And what they observed was very obvious.</p>
<p>They observed that testosterone levels</p>
<p>were lowest in the winter months</p>
<p>and were highest in the months</p>
<p>of June, July, August, and September.</p>
<p>Now, these are very important data.</p>
<p>At least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>these are the first data systematically exploring</p>
<p>the levels of sex steroid hormones in humans</p>
<p>as a function of time of year and thereby</p>
<p>as a function of how much sunlight exposure they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable about these data</p>
<p>is that they map very well to the data in mice</p>
<p>and the other data in this paper on humans,</p>
<p>which illustrate that if you&rsquo;re getting more UVB exposure,</p>
<p>your testosterone levels are higher.</p>
<p>This study went a step further and explored</p>
<p>whether or not the amount of sunlight exposure</p>
<p>that one is getting to their skin influences</p>
<p>their psychology in terms of whether or not</p>
<p>they have increased desire to mate and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-known that sunlight exposure</p>
<p>to the eyes can increase mood.</p>
<p>And I talked about this in the podcast episode</p>
<p>with my guest, Dr. Samer Hattar,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the director of the chronobiology unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>And Samer&rsquo;s recommendation is that people get</p>
<p>as much bright light exposure as they safely can</p>
<p>in the morning and throughout the day</p>
<p>for sake of both sleep and energy,</p>
<p>but also for enhancing mood and regulating appetite.</p>
<p>In this study, it was found that both males and females</p>
<p>had higher levels of romantic passion</p>
<p>after getting the UV treatment.</p>
<p>In fact, some of them reported increases in romantic passion</p>
<p>from just one or two of these UV treatments.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t have to go through all 10 or 12</p>
<p>in order to get a statistically significant increase</p>
<p>in passion.</p>
<p>Now, when we talk about passion,</p>
<p>as the authors of this paper acknowledge,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really two forms.</p>
<p>There is emotional and sexual.</p>
<p>And they parsed this pretty finely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into all the details</p>
<p>and we can provide a reference and link to this study</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to look at those details.</p>
<p>But what they found was that women receiving</p>
<p>this UVB light exposure focused more on increases</p>
<p>in physical arousal and sexual passion,</p>
<p>whereas the men actually scored higher</p>
<p>on the cognitive dimensions of passion,</p>
<p>such as obsessive thoughts about their partner and so on.</p>
<p>Regardless, both males and females experienced</p>
<p>and reported a increase in sexual passion</p>
<p>and desire to mate.</p>
<p>And we now know there were increases in testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen, which of course could be driving</p>
<p>the psychological changes.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m sure that those interact in both directions,</p>
<p>meaning the hormones no doubt affect psychology</p>
<p>and no doubt the psychology,</p>
<p>these changes in passionate feelings,</p>
<p>no doubt also increased or changed</p>
<p>the hormone levels as well.</p>
<p>And I want to reemphasize that there was a component</p>
<p>of the study that had no deliberate daylight,</p>
<p>sunlight exposure for 20 or 30 minutes,</p>
<p>but rather just looked at hormone levels</p>
<p>throughout the year and found that the increase</p>
<p>in day length correlated with increases</p>
<p>in testosterone and sexual passion.</p>
<p>Now, my opinion, this is a very noteworthy study</p>
<p>because it really illustrates that sunlight</p>
<p>and day length can impact the melatonin pathway</p>
<p>and thereby take the foot off the brake, so to speak,</p>
<p>on testosterone, estrogen, and the desire to mate.</p>
<p>It also emphasizes that sunlight, UVB light,</p>
<p>can directly trigger hormone pathways</p>
<p>and desire to mate and mating behavior.</p>
<p>Now, this study went a step further</p>
<p>in defining the precise mechanism</p>
<p>by which light can impact all these hormones</p>
<p>and this desire to mate.</p>
<p>And here, understanding the mechanism is key</p>
<p>if you want to export a particular protocol</p>
<p>or tool that you might apply.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about how UVB light exposure</p>
<p>to the eyes triggers activation</p>
<p>of these particular neurons within the eye,</p>
<p>and then with centers deeper in the brain</p>
<p>and eventually the pineal gland</p>
<p>to suppress the output of melatonin</p>
<p>and thereby to allow testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>to exist at higher levels</p>
<p>because melatonin can inhibit testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>In this study, they were able to very clearly establish</p>
<p>that it is sunlight exposure to our skin</p>
<p>that is causing these hormone increases</p>
<p>that they observed in mice and humans.</p>
<p>And the way they did that</p>
<p>was to use the so-called knockout technology,</p>
<p>the ability to remove specific genes</p>
<p>within specific tissues of the body.</p>
<p>And what they found is that UVB light,</p>
<p>meaning sunlight exposed skin,</p>
<p>upregulated, meaning increased the activity</p>
<p>of something called P53,</p>
<p>which is involved in the maturation of cells</p>
<p>and various aspects of cellular function.</p>
<p>And the cells they were focused on were the keratinocytes,</p>
<p>which you are now familiar with</p>
<p>from our earlier discussion about the fact</p>
<p>that the epidermis of your skin</p>
<p>contains mainly keratinocytes and melanocytes.</p>
<p>Sunlight exposure increased P53 activity in the skin</p>
<p>and P53 activity was required</p>
<p>for the downstream increases in ovarian size,</p>
<p>in testicular size, in testosterone increases,</p>
<p>in the estrogen increases,</p>
<p>and the various other changes that they observed</p>
<p>at the physiological level</p>
<p>when animals or humans were exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>So these data are important because what they mean</p>
<p>is that not only is it important</p>
<p>that we get sunlight exposure early in the day</p>
<p>and throughout the day to our eyes,</p>
<p>at least as much as is safely possible,</p>
<p>but that we also need to get UVB sunlight exposure</p>
<p>onto our skin if we want to activate this P53 pathway</p>
<p>in keratinocytes and the testosterone and estrogen increases</p>
<p>that are downstream of that P53 pathway.</p>
<p>So even though the gene knockout studies were done on mice,</p>
<p>they clearly show that if you remove P53 from the skin,</p>
<p>that these effects simply do not occur.</p>
<p>So in terms of thinking about a protocol</p>
<p>to increase testosterone and estrogen mood</p>
<p>and feelings of passion,</p>
<p>the idea is that you would want to get</p>
<p>this two to three exposures per week minimum</p>
<p>of 20 to 30 minutes of sunlight exposure</p>
<p>onto as much of your body</p>
<p>as you can reasonably expose it to.</p>
<p>And when I say reasonably, I mean,</p>
<p>of course you have to obey cultural constraints,</p>
<p>decency constraints,</p>
<p>and of course you have to also obey the fact</p>
<p>that sunlight can burn your skin.</p>
<p>So many people are probably going to ask</p>
<p>what happens if you wear sunscreen?</p>
<p>Well, in theory, because sunscreen has UV protection,</p>
<p>it would block some of these effects.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting that people do away</p>
<p>with sunscreen entirely.</p>
<p>I do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen</p>
<p>in the future because sunscreen is a bit</p>
<p>of a controversial topic.</p>
<p>Skin cancers are a real thing,</p>
<p>and many people are especially prone to skin cancer.</p>
<p>So you need to take that seriously.</p>
<p>Some people are not very prone to skin cancers</p>
<p>and can tolerate much more sun exposure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the simple fact</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;ve gone outside on the beach with friends,</p>
<p>some people get burned very easily, others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you really should prioritize the health</p>
<p>and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.</p>
<p>However, these data and other data point to the fact</p>
<p>that we should all probably be striving</p>
<p>to get more sunlight exposure onto our skin</p>
<p>during the winter months</p>
<p>and still getting sunlight exposure onto our skin</p>
<p>in the summer months,</p>
<p>provided we can do that without damaging our skin.</p>
<p>Another set of very impressive effects of UVB light,</p>
<p>whether or not it comes from sunlight</p>
<p>or from an artificial source,</p>
<p>is the effect of UVB light on our tolerance for pain.</p>
<p>It turns out that our tolerance for pain</p>
<p>varies across the year,</p>
<p>and that our pain tolerance is increased</p>
<p>in longer day conditions.</p>
<p>And as we saw with the effects of UVB</p>
<p>on hormones and mating,</p>
<p>again, this is occurring via UVB exposure to the skin</p>
<p>and UVB exposure to the eyes.</p>
<p>I want to just describe two studies</p>
<p>that really capture the essence of these results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to discuss these in kind of a top contour fashion.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into it as quite as much depth</p>
<p>as I did the last study,</p>
<p>but I will provide links to these studies as well.</p>
<p>The first study is entitled</p>
<p>Skin Exposure to Ultraviolet B</p>
<p>Rapidly Activates Systemic Neuroendocrine</p>
<p>and Immunosuppressive Responses.</p>
<p>And you might hear that and think,</p>
<p>oh, immunosuppressive, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>But basically what they observed</p>
<p>is that even one exposure to UVB light</p>
<p>changed the output of particular hormones</p>
<p>and neurochemicals in the body,</p>
<p>such as corticotropin hormone and beta endorphins,</p>
<p>which are these endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of the opioid crisis,</p>
<p>which is people getting addicted to opioids</p>
<p>that they are taking in drug form, pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>But here I&rsquo;m referring to endorphins</p>
<p>that our body naturally manufactures and releases</p>
<p>in order to counter pain</p>
<p>and act as a somewhat of a psychological soother also,</p>
<p>because of course, physical pain and emotional pain</p>
<p>are intimately linked in the brain and body.</p>
<p>What they found was that exposure to UVB light</p>
<p>increased the release of these beta endorphins.</p>
<p>It caused essentially the release</p>
<p>of an endogenous painkiller.</p>
<p>Now, a second study that came out very recently,</p>
<p>just this last week, in fact,</p>
<p>published in the journal Neuron,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>is entitled a visual circuit related</p>
<p>to the periaqueductal gray area</p>
<p>for the anti-nosusceptive effects</p>
<p>of bright light treatment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll translate a little bit of that for you.</p>
<p>The periaqueductal gray is a region of the midbrain</p>
<p>that contains a lot of neurons</p>
<p>that can release endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>Things like beta enkephalin, things like enkephalin,</p>
<p>things like mu opioid.</p>
<p>These are all names of chemicals</p>
<p>that your body can manufacture</p>
<p>that act as endogenous painkillers</p>
<p>and increase your tolerance for pain.</p>
<p>They actually make you feel less pain overall</p>
<p>by shutting down some of the neurons that perceive pain</p>
<p>or by reducing their activity,</p>
<p>not to a dangerous level, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to block the pain response</p>
<p>so that you burn yourself unnecessarily</p>
<p>or harm yourself unnecessarily,</p>
<p>but they act as a bit of a painkiller from the inside.</p>
<p>If you heard the word anti-nosusceptive,</p>
<p>nociception is basically the perception</p>
<p>or the way in which neurons respond to painful stimuli.</p>
<p>So you can think of nociceptive events</p>
<p>in your nervous system as painful events.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m using a broad brush.</p>
<p>I realized that the experts in pain will say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s not a really a pain circuit, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fair to say that nociception is the perception of pain.</p>
<p>So if this title is a visual circuit</p>
<p>related to the periaqueductal gray,</p>
<p>which is this area that releases these endogenous opioids</p>
<p>for the anti-nosusceptive,</p>
<p>the anti-pain effects of bright light treatment.</p>
<p>The key finding of this study</p>
<p>is that it is light landing on the eyes</p>
<p>and captured by the specific cells</p>
<p>I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>those intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>melanopsin ganglion cells is the long name for them.</p>
<p>But these particular neurons in your eye</p>
<p>and in my eye, incidentally,</p>
<p>that communicate with particular brain areas.</p>
<p>These brain areas have names.</p>
<p>If you want to know them for you aficionados</p>
<p>or for you ultra curious folks,</p>
<p>they have names like the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</p>
<p>and the intergeniculate leaflet.</p>
<p>The names don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The point is that light landing on the eyes</p>
<p>is captured by these melanopsin cells.</p>
<p>They absorb that light,</p>
<p>translate that light into electrical signals</p>
<p>that are handed off to areas of the brain,</p>
<p>such as the ventral geniculate.</p>
<p>And then the ventral geniculate</p>
<p>communicates with this periaqueductal gray area</p>
<p>to evoke the release of these endogenous opioids</p>
<p>that soothe you and lead to less perception of pain.</p>
<p>This is a really important study</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s long been known that in longer days</p>
<p>or in bright light environments,</p>
<p>we tolerate emotional and physical pain better.</p>
<p>Previous studies had shown</p>
<p>that it is light landing on our skin</p>
<p>that mediates that effect,</p>
<p>but only in part, it couldn&rsquo;t explain the entire effect.</p>
<p>This very recent study indicates</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s also light arriving at the eyes.</p>
<p>And in this case, again, UVB light,</p>
<p>ultraviolet blue light of the sort that comes from sunlight,</p>
<p>that is triggering these anti-pain</p>
<p>or pain relieving pathways.</p>
<p>So once again, we have two parallel pathways.</p>
<p>This is a theme you&rsquo;re going to hear</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>not just in this episode,</p>
<p>but in all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>because this is the way</p>
<p>that your brain and body are built.</p>
<p>Nature rarely relies on one mechanism</p>
<p>in order to create an important phenomenon</p>
<p>and pain relief is an important phenomenon.</p>
<p>So we now have at least two examples</p>
<p>of the potent effects of UVB light exposure</p>
<p>to the skin and to the eyes.</p>
<p>One involving activation of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen pathways as it relates to mating,</p>
<p>and another that relates to reducing the total amount</p>
<p>of pain that we experience</p>
<p>in response to any painful stimuli.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are thinking tools and protocols,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s experiencing chronic pain,</p>
<p>provided you can do it safely,</p>
<p>try to get some UVB exposure, ideally from sunlight.</p>
<p>I think the 20 to 30 minute protocol,</p>
<p>two or three times per week is an excellent one.</p>
<p>It seems like a fairly low dose of UVB light exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine getting much damage to the skin.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have very sensitive skin,</p>
<p>or if you live in an area of the world</p>
<p>that is very, very bright and has intense sunlight,</p>
<p>particular times of year, you&rsquo;ll want to be cautious.</p>
<p>Heed the warnings and considerations about sunscreen</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier or about wearing a hat.</p>
<p>But the point is very clear.</p>
<p>Most of us should be getting more UVB exposure from sunlight.</p>
<p>I can already hear the screams within the comments</p>
<p>or the rather the questions within the comments saying,</p>
<p>well, what if I live in a part of the world</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t get much UVB exposure?</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize something that I&rsquo;ve also emphasized</p>
<p>in the many discussions on this podcast</p>
<p>related to sleep and circadian rhythms and alertness,</p>
<p>which is even on a cloud covered day,</p>
<p>you are going to get far more light energy photons</p>
<p>through cloud cover than you are going to get</p>
<p>from an indoor light source, an artificial light source.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>If you look outside in the morning and you see some sunlight,</p>
<p>if you see some sunlight throughout the day,</p>
<p>you would do yourself a great favor to try and chase</p>
<p>some of that sunlight and get into that sunlight</p>
<p>to expose your eyes and your skin to that sunlight</p>
<p>as much as you safely can.</p>
<p>And when I say as much as you safely can,</p>
<p>never ever look at any light, artificial sunlight</p>
<p>or otherwise that&rsquo;s so bright that it&rsquo;s painful to look at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to get that light arriving on your eyes indirectly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think about the biology of the eye</p>
<p>and the way that those lenses work,</p>
<p>they will just serve to focus that light</p>
<p>onto the very cells that you want those light beams</p>
<p>to be delivered to.</p>
<p>Whereas sunglasses that are highly reflective</p>
<p>or trying to get your sunlight exposure</p>
<p>through a windshield of a car or through a window</p>
<p>simply won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you, but most windows are designed</p>
<p>to filter out the UVB light.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s really keen on blue blockers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wearing your blue blockers all day,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t wear them outside.</p>
<p>And in fact, you&rsquo;re probably doing yourself a disservice</p>
<p>by wearing them in the morning and in the daytime.</p>
<p>There certainly is a place for blue blockers</p>
<p>in the evening and nighttime,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having issues with falling and staying asleep.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, blue blockers,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re really doing is blocking those short wavelength</p>
<p>UVB wavelengths of light that you so desperately need</p>
<p>to arrive at your retina.</p>
<p>And of course, also onto your skin</p>
<p>in order to get these powerful biological effects</p>
<p>on hormones and on pain reduction.</p>
<p>And in terms of skin exposure,</p>
<p>these data also might make you think a little bit</p>
<p>about whether or not you should wear short sleeves</p>
<p>or long sleeves, whether or not you want to wear shorts</p>
<p>or a skirt or pants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to depend on the context of your life</p>
<p>and the social and other variables</p>
<p>that are important, of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know each and every one of your circumstances,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t tell you to do X or Y or Z, nor would I,</p>
<p>but you might take into consideration</p>
<p>that it is the total amount of skin exposure</p>
<p>that is going to allow you to capture more or fewer photons,</p>
<p>depending on, for instance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re completely cloaked in clothing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just exposed in the hands, neck and face,</p>
<p>such as I am now,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re outside in shorts and a t-shirt,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get very, very different patterns</p>
<p>of biological signaling activation</p>
<p>in those two circumstances.</p>
<p>Many of you, I&rsquo;m guessing, are wondering</p>
<p>whether or not you should seek out UVB exposure</p>
<p>throughout the entire year or only in the summer months.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of going to depend</p>
<p>on whether or not you experience depression</p>
<p>in the winter months, so-called seasonal affective disorder.</p>
<p>Some people have mild,</p>
<p>some people have severe forms</p>
<p>of seasonal affective disorder.</p>
<p>Some people love the fall and winter and the shorter days.</p>
<p>They love bundling up, they love the leaves,</p>
<p>they love the snow, they love the cold,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t experience those psychological lows.</p>
<p>So it varies tremendously.</p>
<p>And there are genetic differences</p>
<p>and birthplace origin differences that relate to all this,</p>
<p>but really it has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>I personally believe, and this was reinforced</p>
<p>by the director of the chronobiology unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health, Sam Rathar,</p>
<p>that we would all do well to get more UVB exposure</p>
<p>from sunlight throughout the entire year,</p>
<p>provided we aren&rsquo;t burning our skin</p>
<p>or damaging our eyes in some way.</p>
<p>In addition to that, during the winter months,</p>
<p>if you do experience some drop in energy</p>
<p>or increase in depression or psychological lows,</p>
<p>it can be very beneficial to access a sad lamp,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t want to buy a sad lamp,</p>
<p>because oftentimes they can be very expensive,</p>
<p>you might do well to simply get a LED lighting panel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve described one before,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize that I have no affiliation whatsoever</p>
<p>to these commercial sources,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve described one before and I&rsquo;ll describe it again,</p>
<p>and we can provide a link to a couple examples of these</p>
<p>in the show note captions, excuse me.</p>
<p>This is a 930 to 1000 lux LUX light source</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed for drawing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a drawing box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thin panel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the size of a laptop.</p>
<p>Very inexpensive compared to the typical sad lamp.</p>
<p>I actually have one,</p>
<p>and I position it on my desk all day long.</p>
<p>I also have enough skylights above my desk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sensitive to the effects of light.</p>
<p>So in longer days,</p>
<p>I feel much better than I do in shorter days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never suffered from full-blown</p>
<p>seasonal affective disorder,</p>
<p>but I keep that light source on throughout the day,</p>
<p>throughout the year.</p>
<p>But I also make it a point to get outside</p>
<p>and get sunlight early in the morning</p>
<p>and several times throughout the day.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s particularly overcast outside,</p>
<p>or there just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of sunlight</p>
<p>coming through those clouds,</p>
<p>I will try to look at that light source</p>
<p>a little bit more each day</p>
<p>in order to trigger these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, some people may desire to get UVB exposure</p>
<p>to their skin,</p>
<p>and they want to do that through sources</p>
<p>other than sunlight.</p>
<p>And there, it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>There are, of course, tanning salons,</p>
<p>which basically are beds of UVB light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to one.</p>
<p>I know people do frequent them</p>
<p>in certain parts of the world.</p>
<p>There, of course, people are covering their eyes.</p>
<p>They are only getting UVB exposure to their skin typically,</p>
<p>because the UVB exposure, or intensities rather,</p>
<p>tends to be very, very high.</p>
<p>And so you can actually damage your eyes</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking at a very, very bright</p>
<p>artificial UVB source up close.</p>
<p>So you really have to explore these options for yourself.</p>
<p>Sunlight, of course, being the original</p>
<p>and still the best way to get UVB exposure.</p>
<p>So without knowing your particular circumstances,</p>
<p>finances, genetics, or place of origin, et cetera,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t know whether or not</p>
<p>you need to use artificial sources.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to gauge that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, getting outside,</p>
<p>looking at and getting some exposure of UVB onto your skin</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial</p>
<p>for the vast majority of people out there.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s even going to be beneficial</p>
<p>for people that are blind.</p>
<p>People that are blind, provided they still have eyes,</p>
<p>often maintain these melanopsin cells.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>getting UVB exposure to your eyes can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for sake of mood, hormone pathways,</p>
<p>pain reduction, and so forth.</p>
<p>A cautionary note, people who have retinitis pigmentosa,</p>
<p>macular degeneration, or glaucoma,</p>
<p>as well as people who are especially prone to skin cancers</p>
<p>should definitely consult with your ophthalmologist</p>
<p>and dermatologist before you start increasing</p>
<p>the total amount of UVB exposure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting from any source,</p>
<p>sunlight or otherwise.</p>
<p>There are additional very interesting</p>
<p>and powerful effects of UVB light,</p>
<p>in particular on immune function.</p>
<p>All the organs of our body are inside our skin.</p>
<p>And so information about external conditions,</p>
<p>meaning the environment that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>need to be communicated to the various organs of our body.</p>
<p>Some of them have more direct access</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on outside.</p>
<p>So for instance, the cells in your brain</p>
<p>that reside right over the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>your hypothalamus, they control hormone output</p>
<p>and they control the biological functions</p>
<p>that we call circadian functions,</p>
<p>the one that change every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Well, those are just one or two connections,</p>
<p>meaning synapses away from those cells in your eye</p>
<p>that perceive UVB light, excuse me.</p>
<p>Other organs of your body, such as your spleen,</p>
<p>which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells</p>
<p>that combat infection,</p>
<p>well, those are a long ways away</p>
<p>from those cells in your eye.</p>
<p>And in fact, they&rsquo;re a long ways away from your skin.</p>
<p>There are beautiful studies showing that</p>
<p>if we get more UVB exposure from sunlight</p>
<p>or from appropriate artificial sources,</p>
<p>that spleen and immune function are enhanced.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very logical, well-established circuit</p>
<p>as to how that happens.</p>
<p>Your brain actually connects to your spleen.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not the case that you can simply think,</p>
<p>okay, spleen, turn on, release killer cells,</p>
<p>go out and combat infection.</p>
<p>However, UVB light arriving on the eyes</p>
<p>is known to trigger activation of the neurons</p>
<p>within the so-called sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>These neurons are part of the larger thing</p>
<p>that we call the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s below or not accessible by conscious control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that controls your heartbeat,</p>
<p>controls your breathing,</p>
<p>and that also activates or flips on the switch</p>
<p>of your immune system.</p>
<p>When we get a lot of UVB light in our eyes,</p>
<p>or I should say sufficient UVB light in our eyes,</p>
<p>a particular channel, a particular set of connections</p>
<p>within the sympathetic nervous system is activated</p>
<p>and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules</p>
<p>that scavenge for and combat infection.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve noticed that you get fewer colds and flus</p>
<p>and other forms of illness in the summer months,</p>
<p>part of that could be because of the increase in temperature</p>
<p>in your environment,</p>
<p>because typically longer days are associated</p>
<p>with more warmth in your environment</p>
<p>as opposed to winter days, which are short,</p>
<p>when it tends to be colder out.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s also the case,</p>
<p>the people around you have fewer colds and flus</p>
<p>and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flus</p>
<p>and other infections,</p>
<p>because if those infections,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re bacterial or viral,</p>
<p>arrive in your body, right?</p>
<p>If you inhale them or they get into your mouth</p>
<p>or on your skin,</p>
<p>your spleen meets those infections with a greater output.</p>
<p>In other words, the soldiers of your immune system,</p>
<p>the chemicals and cell types of your immune system,</p>
<p>that combat infection are in a more ready deployed stance,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the immune system</p>
<p>and immune function,</p>
<p>I did an entire episode about the immune system</p>
<p>and the brain in a,</p>
<p>you can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We talk about cytokines,</p>
<p>we talk about killer cells, B cells, T cells, et cetera,</p>
<p>a lot of detail there.</p>
<p>So we often think about the summer months</p>
<p>and the spring months as fewer infections floating around,</p>
<p>but in fact, there aren&rsquo;t fewer infections floating around.</p>
<p>We are simply better at combating those infections</p>
<p>and therefore there&rsquo;s less infection floating around.</p>
<p>So we are still confronted with a lot of infections.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just able to combat them better.</p>
<p>What does this mean in terms of a tool?</p>
<p>What it means is that during the winter months,</p>
<p>we should be especially conscious of accessing UVB light</p>
<p>to enhance our spleen function,</p>
<p>to make sure that our sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is activated to a sufficient level</p>
<p>to keep our immune system deploying all those killer T cells</p>
<p>and B cells and cytokines</p>
<p>so that when we encounter the infections,</p>
<p>as we inevitably will, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly being bombarded with potential infections</p>
<p>that we can combat those infections well.</p>
<p>And as just a brief aside,</p>
<p>but I should mention a brief aside</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to tens of thousands of quality studies.</p>
<p>It is well-known that wound healing is faster</p>
<p>when we are getting sufficient UVB exposure.</p>
<p>Typically that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with the longer days of spring and summer.</p>
<p>It is known that turnover of hair cells,</p>
<p>the very cells that give rise to hair cells</p>
<p>are called stem cells.</p>
<p>They live in little so-called niches in our skin</p>
<p>with these hair stem cells</p>
<p>and your hair grows faster in longer days.</p>
<p>That too is triggered by UVB exposure,</p>
<p>not just to the skin, but to the eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There was a study published</p>
<p>in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>a couple of years ago</p>
<p>that showed that the exposure</p>
<p>of those melanopsin ganglion cells in your eyes</p>
<p>is absolutely critical for triggering</p>
<p>the turnover of stem cells in both the skin and hair</p>
<p>and also it turns out in nails.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve noticed that your skin, your hair,</p>
<p>and your nails look better and turnover more,</p>
<p>meaning grow faster in longer days,</p>
<p>that is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>That is not just your perception.</p>
<p>In fact, hair grows more, skin turns over more,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s going to look more youthful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to essentially remove older skin cells</p>
<p>and replace them with new cells</p>
<p>and all the renewing cells and tissues of our body</p>
<p>are going to proliferate,</p>
<p>are going to recreate themselves more</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re getting sufficient UVB light to our eyes</p>
<p>and also to our skin.</p>
<p>And so while some of you may think of light therapies</p>
<p>such as red light therapies or UVB therapies</p>
<p>as kind of new agey or just biohacking,</p>
<p>again, a phrase I don&rsquo;t particularly like,</p>
<p>this notion of biohacking</p>
<p>because it implies using one thing</p>
<p>for a purpose that it was never intended to have.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that UVB exposure and red light,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ll soon see, is a very potent form</p>
<p>of increasing things like wound healing and skin health</p>
<p>for very logical mechanistically backed reasons.</p>
<p>So while I can&rsquo;t account for everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being promoted out there</p>
<p>in terms of this light source</p>
<p>will help your skin look more youthful</p>
<p>or will help heal your scars,</p>
<p>the mechanistic basis for light</p>
<p>having those effects makes total sense.</p>
<p>But what you should consider, however,</p>
<p>is that if the particular light therapy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re considering involves very local application</p>
<p>rather than illuminating broad swaths of skin</p>
<p>and if it has no involvement with the eyes,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s no delivery of UVB or red light</p>
<p>or the other light therapy to the eyes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not going to be as potent a treatment</p>
<p>as would a more systemic activation</p>
<p>of larger areas of skin and the eyes.</p>
<p>Now, again, a cautionary note,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want people taking technologies</p>
<p>that were designed for local application</p>
<p>and beaming those into the eyes.</p>
<p>That could be very, very bad</p>
<p>and damaging to your retinal and other tissues.</p>
<p>Certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want you taking bright light</p>
<p>of very high intensity of any kind</p>
<p>and getting cavalier about that.</p>
<p>Typically the local illumination of say a wound</p>
<p>or a particular patch of acne</p>
<p>or some other form of skin treatment</p>
<p>involves very high intensity light.</p>
<p>And if the intensity is too high,</p>
<p>you can actually damage that skin.</p>
<p>And so as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few moments,</p>
<p>most of those therapies for modifying skin</p>
<p>involve actually burning off a small,</p>
<p>very thin layer at the top of the epidermis</p>
<p>in efforts to trigger the renewal</p>
<p>or the activation of stem cells</p>
<p>that will replenish that with new cells.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a fine line to be had</p>
<p>between light therapies that are very localized and intense,</p>
<p>which are designed to damage skin</p>
<p>and cause reactivation of new stem cells,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s hair cells or skin cells, et cetera,</p>
<p>versus systemic activation</p>
<p>across broad swaths of skin in the eyes.</p>
<p>You really have to consider this on a case-by-case basis,</p>
<p>but at least for now,</p>
<p>just consider that increases in hormones,</p>
<p>reduction in pain by way of increases in enkephalin</p>
<p>and other endogenous opioids,</p>
<p>improving immune status by activating the spleen</p>
<p>and so on and so on,</p>
<p>really are all the downstream consequence</p>
<p>of illuminating large swaths of skin</p>
<p>and making sure that those neurons within the eye</p>
<p>get their adequate UVB exposure</p>
<p>or other light wavelength exposure,</p>
<p>not simply beaming a particular wavelength of light</p>
<p>at a particular location on the body</p>
<p>and hoping that that particular illumination</p>
<p>at a particular location on the body</p>
<p>is going to somehow change the biology at that location.</p>
<p>Our biology just really doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but in general,</p>
<p>systemic effects through broad-scale illumination</p>
<p>and illumination to the eye</p>
<p>combined with local treatments</p>
<p>are very likely to be the ones that have the most success.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to the effects of light on mood more specifically.</p>
<p>We talked about this</p>
<p>in terms of seasonal affective disorder,</p>
<p>but many of us don&rsquo;t suffer from seasonal affective disorder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to drill a little deeper</p>
<p>into how light impacts mood.</p>
<p>And here I want to, again, paraphrase the statements</p>
<p>of Dr. Samar Hattar</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>I should mention the director of the chronobiology unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health</p>
<p>and perhaps one of the top one to two to three world experts</p>
<p>in how light can impact mood, appetite, circadian rhythms,</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>Samar stated on the podcast,</p>
<p>and he said in various other venues as well,</p>
<p>that getting as much UVB light in our eyes</p>
<p>and on our skin in the early day</p>
<p>and throughout the day as safely possible</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial for mood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also another time of day,</p>
<p>or rather I should say a time of night</p>
<p>in which UVB can be leveraged in order to improve mood.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually the inverse of everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about up until now.</p>
<p>We have a particular neural circuit</p>
<p>that originates with those melanopsin cells in our eye</p>
<p>that bypass all the areas of the brain</p>
<p>associated with circadian clocks.</p>
<p>So everything related to sleep and wakefulness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specifically dedicated to the pathways</p>
<p>involving the release of molecules like dopamine,</p>
<p>the neuromodulator that&rsquo;s associated with motivation,</p>
<p>with feeling good,</p>
<p>with feeling like there&rsquo;s possibility in the world,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And other molecules as well, including serotonin</p>
<p>and some of those endogenous opioids</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>That particular pathway involves a brain structure</p>
<p>called the perihabenular nucleus.</p>
<p>The perihabenular nucleus gets input</p>
<p>from the cells in the eye that respond to UVB light,</p>
<p>and frankly, to bright light of other wavelengths as well,</p>
<p>because as you recall, if a light is bright enough,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not UV or blue light,</p>
<p>it can activate those cells in the eye.</p>
<p>Those cells in the eye communicate</p>
<p>to the perihabenular nucleus.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, if this pathway is activated</p>
<p>at the wrong time of each 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>mood gets worse, dopamine output gets worse.</p>
<p>Molecules that are there specifically to make us feel good</p>
<p>actually are reduced in their output.</p>
<p>So while UVB exposure in the morning</p>
<p>and throughout the day is going to be very important</p>
<p>for elevating and maintaining elevated mood,</p>
<p>avoiding UVB light at night is actually a way</p>
<p>in which we can prevent activation</p>
<p>of this eye to perihabenular pathway</p>
<p>that can actually turn on depression.</p>
<p>To be very direct and succinct about this,</p>
<p>avoid exposure to UVB light from artificial sources.</p>
<p>Between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re somebody who suffers from low mood</p>
<p>and overall has a kind of mild depression</p>
<p>or even severe depression, of course,</p>
<p>please see a psychiatrist, see a trained psychologist,</p>
<p>get that treated.</p>
<p>But you would do especially well to avoid UVB exposure</p>
<p>from artificial sources, not just from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>but really be careful about getting too much exposure</p>
<p>to UVB even in the late evening,</p>
<p>so 8 p.m. perhaps to 4 a.m.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough that if you view UVB light,</p>
<p>you activate those neurons in your eye very potently,</p>
<p>and if those cells communicate</p>
<p>to the perihabenular nucleus, which they do,</p>
<p>you will truncate or reduce the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that you release.</p>
<p>So if you want to keep your mood elevated,</p>
<p>get a lot of light, UVB light throughout the day,</p>
<p>and at night, really be cautious</p>
<p>about getting UVB exposure from artificial sources.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody who has no issues with mood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just the happiest person all year long,</p>
<p>or maybe you just have subtle variations in your mood,</p>
<p>you feel great about that.</p>
<p>Turns out that you still want to be very careful</p>
<p>about light exposure between the hours of 10 p.m. or so</p>
<p>and 4 a.m., in fact, even during sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a recent study that just came out</p>
<p>in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s entitled Light Exposure During Sleep</p>
<p>Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting study</p>
<p>where they took human subjects, young adults,</p>
<p>and having them sleep in rooms</p>
<p>that had different lighting conditions,</p>
<p>either dim light or slightly bright light.</p>
<p>Now, many people can&rsquo;t fall asleep in brightly lit rooms,</p>
<p>so they acknowledge this.</p>
<p>These were not very brightly lit rooms.</p>
<p>These were rooms that had just a little bit</p>
<p>of overhead room lighting, 100 lux,</p>
<p>which is not very bright at all,</p>
<p>or they had them sleep in a room that had very dim light,</p>
<p>which is less than three lux.</p>
<p>If you want to get a sense of how bright three lux is</p>
<p>versus 100 lux, I would encourage you</p>
<p>to download the free app Light Meter.</p>
<p>I have no relationship to the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cool app.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve used it for a long time</p>
<p>where you can basically point your phone</p>
<p>at a particular light source, sun or otherwise,</p>
<p>and you just press the button,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you an approximate readout of lux,</p>
<p>which is the light intensity that the phone happens</p>
<p>to be staring out at at that location.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exact, but it&rsquo;s a pretty good</p>
<p>back of the envelope measure of light intensity.</p>
<p>So these subjects were either sleeping</p>
<p>in a very dim room, three lux is very, very dim,</p>
<p>or a somewhat dim room, 100 lux.</p>
<p>In this study, they measured things like melatonin levels.</p>
<p>They looked at heart rate.</p>
<p>They looked at measures of insulin and glucose management.</p>
<p>Now, in previous episodes, I&rsquo;ve talked about how glucose,</p>
<p>blood sugar, is regulated by insulin</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want your glucose levels</p>
<p>to be too high, hyperglycemia, or too low, hypoglycemia,</p>
<p>and the hormone insulin is involved in sequestering</p>
<p>and shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Basically, how well you manage glucose in the bloodstream</p>
<p>can be indirectly measured by your insulin levels.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s well-known that sleep deprivation</p>
<p>can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.</p>
<p>However, in this study, subjects were sleeping</p>
<p>the whole night through.</p>
<p>It just so happens that some of the subjects were sleeping</p>
<p>in this very dimly lit room, three lux,</p>
<p>and other subjects were sleeping</p>
<p>in a somewhat dimly lit room, 100 lux.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incredible about this study</p>
<p>is that both rooms were sufficiently dim</p>
<p>that melatonin levels were not altered in either case.</p>
<p>This is really key.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if one group experienced a lot of bright light</p>
<p>through their eyelids and others did not.</p>
<p>Melatonin levels were not disrupted.</p>
<p>And given how potently light can inhibit melatonin,</p>
<p>this speaks to the fact that this very dim condition</p>
<p>of three lux and the somewhat dim condition of 100 lux</p>
<p>was not actually perceived by the subjects,</p>
<p>nor was it disrupting these hormone pathways.</p>
<p>They also looked at glucose responses.</p>
<p>They had people essentially take a fasting glucose test</p>
<p>in different conditions.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into all the details,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what they found.</p>
<p>In healthy adults, even just one night of sleeping</p>
<p>in a moderately lit environment,</p>
<p>this 100 lux environment caused changes,</p>
<p>increases in nighttime heart rate,</p>
<p>which means that the sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>was overly active as compared to people that slept</p>
<p>in a completely dark or in a very, very dimly lit room,</p>
<p>decreases in heart rate variability.</p>
<p>And here I should point out that heart rate variability</p>
<p>or HRV is a good thing.</p>
<p>We want heart rate variability.</p>
<p>So they saw increases in heart rate,</p>
<p>decreases in heart rate variability,</p>
<p>and increases in next morning insulin resistance,</p>
<p>which is an indication that glucose management</p>
<p>is suffering.</p>
<p>So this is powerful.</p>
<p>The results of this study essentially indicate</p>
<p>that even just one night of sleeping the whole night through</p>
<p>in a dimly lit environment is disrupting the way</p>
<p>that our autonomic nervous system is functioning,</p>
<p>altering so-called autonomic tone,</p>
<p>making us less relaxed is probably the best way</p>
<p>to describe it.</p>
<p>Even though we are asleep,</p>
<p>disrupting the way that our cardiometabolic function</p>
<p>operates such that we have lower heart rate variability</p>
<p>and increased insulin resistance.</p>
<p>This is not a good thing for any of us to experience.</p>
<p>So while we&rsquo;ve mainly been talking about the positive</p>
<p>effects of UVB light and other forms of light,</p>
<p>now we have two examples,</p>
<p>one from the work of Hattar and colleagues showing</p>
<p>that UVB exposure via the perihepenula</p>
<p>can diminish the output of dopamine and other molecules</p>
<p>that make us feel good.</p>
<p>If that UVB exposure is in the middle of the night</p>
<p>or late evening.</p>
<p>And now we have yet another study performed in this case,</p>
<p>in humans,</p>
<p>indicating that even if we fall asleep and sleep the whole</p>
<p>night through,</p>
<p>if the room that we&rsquo;re sleeping in has too many locks,</p>
<p>too much light energy,</p>
<p>that light energy is no doubt going through the eyelids,</p>
<p>which it can activating the particular cells in the eye</p>
<p>that trigger an increase in sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>activation and disrupting our metabolism.</p>
<p>And this study rests on a number of other recent studies</p>
<p>published in Cell,</p>
<p>which is a superb journal and other journals showing that</p>
<p>during the course of a healthy deep night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>our body actually transitions through various forms of</p>
<p>metabolic function.</p>
<p>We actually experience ketosis like states.</p>
<p>We experience gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>We experience different forms of metabolism associated with</p>
<p>different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>not something that we&rsquo;re going into in depth in this</p>
<p>podcast, we will in a future podcast.</p>
<p>What this study shows is that light exposure,</p>
<p>even in sleep is disrupting our autonomic,</p>
<p>in this case,</p>
<p>the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system in ways</p>
<p>that are disrupting metabolism, probably in sleep,</p>
<p>but certainly outside of sleep.</p>
<p>So that we wake up and have our first meal of the day,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>you eat that first meal of the day.</p>
<p>If your sleep is taking place in an environment that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>overly illuminated,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s disrupting your cardiac function and your</p>
<p>metabolism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about UVB light,</p>
<p>which is short wavelength light.</p>
<p>So UV light, blue light, maybe even some blue green light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be short wavelength light.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention to the other end of the</p>
<p>spectrum, meaning the light spectrum,</p>
<p>to talk about red light and infrared light,</p>
<p>which is a long wavelength light.</p>
<p>Many so-called low level light therapies.</p>
<p>The acronym is LLLT,</p>
<p>low level light therapies involve the use of red light and</p>
<p>infrared light.</p>
<p>Sometimes low level light therapies involve the use of UVB,</p>
<p>but more often than not these days,</p>
<p>when we hear LLLT, low level light therapy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s referring to red light and near infrared light</p>
<p>therapies.</p>
<p>Low level light therapies have been shown to be effective</p>
<p>for a huge number of biological phenomenon and medical</p>
<p>treatments.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t summarize all of those now.</p>
<p>It would take me many, many hours.</p>
<p>It would be an effective episode for curing insomnia,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t inform you properly about the use of light</p>
<p>for your health.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;d like to just emphasize some of the top contour</p>
<p>of those studies and point out that for instance,</p>
<p>low level light therapy with infrared light has been shown</p>
<p>to be effective for the treatment of acne and other sorts of</p>
<p>skin lesions.</p>
<p>Been some really nice studies actually,</p>
<p>where they use subjects as their own internal control.</p>
<p>So people believe it or not agreed to have half of their face</p>
<p>illuminated with red light or near infrared light.</p>
<p>And the other half of their face serve as a control.</p>
<p>And to do that for several weeks at a time.</p>
<p>And you can see pretty impressive reductions in skin</p>
<p>lesions, reductions in scars from acne and reduction in acne</p>
<p>lesions themselves,</p>
<p>meaning the accumulation of new acne cysts with low level</p>
<p>light therapy using red light and infrared light.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however,</p>
<p>there is a resistance of that acne to the low level light</p>
<p>therapy, such that people will get an initial improvement</p>
<p>and then it will go away despite continuing the treatment.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re probably asking,</p>
<p>or at least you should be asking,</p>
<p>how is it that shining red light on our skin can impact</p>
<p>things like acne and wound healing, et cetera?</p>
<p>Well, to understand that we have to think back to the</p>
<p>beginning of the episode where I described how long</p>
<p>wavelength light, such as red light and near infrared light,</p>
<p>which is even longer than red light can pass through certain</p>
<p>surfaces, including our skin.</p>
<p>So our skin has an epidermis, which is on the outside.</p>
<p>And the dermis, which is in the deeper layers,</p>
<p>red light and infrared light can pass down into the deeper</p>
<p>layers of our skin where it can change the metabolic</p>
<p>function of particular cells.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take acne as an example, within the dermis,</p>
<p>the deep layers of our skin,</p>
<p>we have what are called sebaceous glands that actually make</p>
<p>the oil that is present in our skin.</p>
<p>Those sebaceous glands are often nearby hair follicles.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever had an infected hair follicle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a coincidence that hair follicles tend to get</p>
<p>infected.</p>
<p>Part of it is because there&rsquo;s actually a portal down and</p>
<p>around the hair follicle,</p>
<p>but the sebaceous gland is where the oil is created.</p>
<p>That is going to give rise to, for instance, acne lesions.</p>
<p>Also in the dermis and the deep layers of the skin are the</p>
<p>melanocytes. They&rsquo;re not just in the epidermis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also in the deeper layers of the skin.</p>
<p>And you have the stem cells that give rise to additional</p>
<p>skin cells.</p>
<p>If the top layers of the epidermis are damaged,</p>
<p>those stem cells can become activated.</p>
<p>And you also have the stem cells that give rise to hair</p>
<p>follicles.</p>
<p>So by shining red light or near infrared light on a</p>
<p>localized patch of skin,</p>
<p>provided that red light is not of such high intensity that</p>
<p>it burns the skin,</p>
<p>but is of sufficient intensity that provides just a little</p>
<p>bit of damage to the upper layers of the skin, the</p>
<p>epidermis,</p>
<p>and that it triggers certain biological pathways within the</p>
<p>cells of the sebaceous gland and the stem cells within the</p>
<p>hair cell niche and the stem cells and skin.</p>
<p>What happens is the top layers of the skin are basically</p>
<p>burned off by a very low level of burn and,</p>
<p>or the cells in the deeper layer start to churn out new</p>
<p>cells, which go and rescue the lesion,</p>
<p>essentially clear out the lesion and replace that lesion</p>
<p>with healthy skin cells.</p>
<p>This does work in the context of wound healing,</p>
<p>getting scars to disappear.</p>
<p>It also works to remove certain patches of pigmentation.</p>
<p>There are sometimes cases where people will get a red</p>
<p>blotchiness due to certain skin conditions or some darker</p>
<p>pigmentation that they want removed or that they need</p>
<p>removed because it&rsquo;s a potential skin cancer threat.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>how is red light actually doing it within the cells of the</p>
<p>sebaceous gland, the stem cells, et cetera?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>long wavelength light can actually get deep into the skin.</p>
<p>I mentioned that before,</p>
<p>but can also get into individual cells and can access the</p>
<p>so-called organelles,</p>
<p>which I described at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>in particular,</p>
<p>they can access the mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are responsible for producing ATP.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>the simple way to think about this for sake of this</p>
<p>discussion is that as cells age,</p>
<p>and in particular in very metabolically active cells,</p>
<p>they accumulate what are called ROSs,</p>
<p>reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>And as reactive oxygen species go up ATP,</p>
<p>energy production in those cells tends to go down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a general statement,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a general statement that in most cases is true.</p>
<p>There are some minor exceptions that don&rsquo;t concern us that</p>
<p>have to do with cell types different than the ones that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about now.</p>
<p>So the way to think about this is that red light passes into</p>
<p>the deeper layers of the skin,</p>
<p>activates mitochondria,</p>
<p>which increases ATP and directly or indirectly reduces these</p>
<p>reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>These reactive oxygen species are not good.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>They cause cellar damage, cellar death,</p>
<p>and for the most part,</p>
<p>just inhibit the way that our cells work.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve heard of red light or near infrared light</p>
<p>therapies designed to heal skin or improve skin quality or</p>
<p>remove lesions or get rid of scars or unwanted pigmentation,</p>
<p>that is not pseudoscience.</p>
<p>That is not woo science.</p>
<p>That is grounded in the very biology of how light interacts</p>
<p>with mitochondria and reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Some of you may also find it interesting to note that some</p>
<p>of the cream-based treatments for acne, for instance,</p>
<p>like retinoic acid,</p>
<p>retin A is actually a derivative of vitamin A and the</p>
<p>pathway involving retinoic acid and vitamin A believe it or</p>
<p>not is very similar to the natural biological pathway by</p>
<p>which photo pigments in the eye convert light information in</p>
<p>to biological changes within those cells.</p>
<p>So the key point here is that light is activating particular</p>
<p>pathways in cells that can either drive death of cells or</p>
<p>can make those cells essentially younger by increasing ATP by</p>
<p>way of improving mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>And in recent years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been some just beautiful examples that exist not</p>
<p>only in the realm of skin biology,</p>
<p>but in the realm of neurobiology whereby red light and near</p>
<p>infrared light can actually be used to enhance the function</p>
<p>of the cells that for instance,</p>
<p>allow us to see better and indeed cells that allow us to</p>
<p>think better.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to review those data because not only are</p>
<p>they interesting in their own right,</p>
<p>but they also point to some very interesting and powerful</p>
<p>application of low cost or zero cost tools that we can use</p>
<p>to improve our vision.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who&rsquo;s interested in the use of red</p>
<p>light or near infrared light,</p>
<p>so-called LLT low-level light therapies for treatment of</p>
<p>dermatologic issues.</p>
<p>So anything related to skin,</p>
<p>I will include a link to a excellent set of reviews.</p>
<p>The first one is light emitting diodes in dermatology,</p>
<p>a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>That one includes review of a very large number of studies</p>
<p>came out just a few years ago in 2018.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very clearly and cleanly laid out for</p>
<p>anyone to access.</p>
<p>You can see the degree of effects of red light,</p>
<p>for instance, on treatment of acne or scarring, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll also provide a link to another review,</p>
<p>which is low-level light therapy in skin,</p>
<p>stimulating healing and restoring.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested again,</p>
<p>in dermatologic issues and the kind of restoring</p>
<p>youthfulness and the kind of general themes of,</p>
<p>of anti-aging and longevity and how red light therapies can</p>
<p>be used for that.</p>
<p>I will encourage you to take a look at those reviews.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re going to find is that rarely, if ever,</p>
<p>is there a study looking at whole body red light</p>
<p>illumination for sake of treating and improving skin?</p>
<p>And I mentioned this because I get a lot of questions about</p>
<p>infrared sauna and global illumination with red lights.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about cases where global illumination of</p>
<p>your whole body or your whole face with red lights might be</p>
<p>useful, but in terms of infrared sauna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned on this podcast before,</p>
<p>and I will certainly go deeper on this in an upcoming</p>
<p>episode,</p>
<p>all about the use of heat and temperature for augmenting</p>
<p>our biology.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>infrared saunas don&rsquo;t get hot enough temperature wise in</p>
<p>order to trigger some of the important effects on growth</p>
<p>hormone and heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>And some of the other things that sauna has been shown to be</p>
<p>excellent for that&rsquo;s a general statement.</p>
<p>I realized there are some infrared saunas that do get hot</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>There are very few data on the use of whole body</p>
<p>illumination with infrared saunas.</p>
<p>They really point to any specific mechanistically supported</p>
<p>effects,</p>
<p>almost all the positive effects that you&rsquo;re going to see of</p>
<p>red light and low level light therapies.</p>
<p>Certainly the ones discussed in the reviews that I just</p>
<p>mentioned are going to be the consequence of very directed</p>
<p>illumination of particular patches of skin that are seeking</p>
<p>repair that people are seeking the repair of.</p>
<p>So again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to disparage infrared saunas,</p>
<p>but in general,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get hot enough to trigger most of the positive</p>
<p>effects that sauna have been demonstrated to have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear at all as to whether or not they can</p>
<p>enhance skin quality,</p>
<p>youthfulness,</p>
<p>restore,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>top layers of skin that are damaged,</p>
<p>repair acne,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So more on heat saunas and infrared saunas in their</p>
<p>comparison in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about a clear set of examples where red light</p>
<p>and near infrared light have been shown to have positive</p>
<p>effects on our health.</p>
<p>And these are the data that I referred to at the beginning</p>
<p>of the episode from Dr.</p>
<p>Glenn Jeffrey at university college, London,</p>
<p>who again is a longstanding member of the neuroscience</p>
<p>community working on visual neuroscience and who over the</p>
<p>last decade or so has really emphasized the exploration of</p>
<p>red light and near infrared light for restoration of</p>
<p>neuronal function.</p>
<p>As we age,</p>
<p>this is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>We know that we don&rsquo;t accumulate many new brain cells as we</p>
<p>get older.</p>
<p>And in some areas of our nervous system,</p>
<p>such as our neural retina,</p>
<p>which is the part of our eye that&rsquo;s responsible for</p>
<p>translating light information to electrical signals so that</p>
<p>we can see we don&rsquo;t get any new cells after the time in</p>
<p>which we were born.</p>
<p>So the ability to keep our neurons healthy is extremely</p>
<p>important for our visual system,</p>
<p>extremely important for our hippocampus,</p>
<p>an area of the brain involved in memory.</p>
<p>And should just mention that even if people don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be some degree of age-related</p>
<p>dementia.</p>
<p>Sadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp in the years before</p>
<p>they die as they are 20 years before that it&rsquo;s just never</p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all getting worse at thinking, feeling, perceiving,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>The question is how quickly we are getting worse.</p>
<p>So any mechanism by which we can preserve or reverse</p>
<p>neuronal function turns out to be immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>The Jeffrey lab has published two studies in recent years on</p>
<p>humans that looked directly, no pun intended,</p>
<p>at how red light and near infrared light can improve visual</p>
<p>function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe the parameters of those studies.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to describe what they found exactly.</p>
<p>The mechanistic motivation for these studies, again,</p>
<p>traces back to this effect of light on mitochondria.</p>
<p>So to go a little bit deeper into that mechanism,</p>
<p>just briefly so that you can frame any potential protocol</p>
<p>that you would develop.</p>
<p>When light arrives on cells, including neurons,</p>
<p>that light can penetrate into the cells.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s of the appropriate wavelength,</p>
<p>red light can do that.</p>
<p>It can get into cells.</p>
<p>It can access the mitochondria.</p>
<p>It can increase ATP in general.</p>
<p>Anytime ATP is doing its thing to increase energy in cells,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involving this thing called cytochrome C,</p>
<p>which is an oxidase.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear ACE, A-S-E in biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be an enzyme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in some process of degrading a molecule and</p>
<p>creating another molecule typically.</p>
<p>So ATP and cytochrome C is going to give you ATP.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a great thing,</p>
<p>but it creates a by-product.</p>
<p>It breaks things down such that you get these ROSs,</p>
<p>these reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>And those reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>are involved in things like redox signaling and reactive</p>
<p>oxygen species actually change which genes are made in a</p>
<p>cell.</p>
<p>So the goal of any treatment to keep neurons or other cells</p>
<p>youthful and functioning well and to prevent or reverse</p>
<p>aging is going to be to increase ATP and to reduce reactive</p>
<p>oxygen species.</p>
<p>And in doing so to disrupt some of the normal pathways</p>
<p>associated with aging.</p>
<p>The Jeffrey lab approached these studies with that</p>
<p>understanding of how mitochondria and reactive oxygen</p>
<p>species and ATP work.</p>
<p>And what they did was exquisitely simple to the point of</p>
<p>being elegant.</p>
<p>And what they found was really, really exciting.</p>
<p>What they did is they had people,</p>
<p>subjects that were either younger.</p>
<p>So in their twenties or 40 years old or older,</p>
<p>view red light of about 670 nanometers,</p>
<p>670 nanometers would appear red to you and me.</p>
<p>They had, they had them do that, excuse me,</p>
<p>at a distance that was safe for their eyes.</p>
<p>So at about a foot away,</p>
<p>now a foot away from a very intense red light could actually</p>
<p>be damaging to the eyes.</p>
<p>So they had them do this at about a foot away from a red</p>
<p>light that was of low enough intensity that did not damage</p>
<p>the eyes.</p>
<p>And they had them do that anywhere from two to three minutes</p>
<p>per day.</p>
<p>And in one study,</p>
<p>they had them do that for a long period of time of about 12</p>
<p>weeks.</p>
<p>And in the other study,</p>
<p>they had them do that just for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable is that when you collapse the results</p>
<p>across these two studies,</p>
<p>what they found is that when looking at these subjects</p>
<p>ranging from 28 years old to about 72 years old,</p>
<p>the major findings were that in individuals,</p>
<p>40 years old or older.</p>
<p>So in the 40 to 72 year old bracket,</p>
<p>but not in the subjects younger than 40 years old,</p>
<p>they saw an improvement in visual function.</p>
<p>That improvement in visual function was an improvement in</p>
<p>visual acuity,</p>
<p>meaning the ability to resolve fine detail and using a</p>
<p>particular measure of visual function,</p>
<p>which is called the Triton exam, T-R-I-T-A-N,</p>
<p>Triton exam,</p>
<p>which specifically addresses the function of the so-called</p>
<p>short wavelength cones,</p>
<p>the ones that respond to green and blue light.</p>
<p>They saw a 22% improvement in visual acuity,</p>
<p>which in the landscape of visual testing is an extremely</p>
<p>exciting result.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think in most studies of improvements of vision,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be very excited to see an improvement of 5% or 10%.</p>
<p>So a 22% improvement in visual acuity,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s in this very specific form of visual</p>
<p>testing, this Triton exam or this Triton score.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>that turns out to be very significant and translates to the</p>
<p>real world in an important way.</p>
<p>In particular,</p>
<p>as we age,</p>
<p>we tend to lose certain neurons within our retina,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t tend to lose cones.</p>
<p>We tend to lose rods.</p>
<p>We tend to lose other cells within the retina,</p>
<p>including the cells that connect the eye to the brain,</p>
<p>the so-called ganglion cells.</p>
<p>Cones for whatever reason are pretty resilient to age</p>
<p>related loss.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>because rods and cones,</p>
<p>both are not just among the most metabolically active cells</p>
<p>in your entire body,</p>
<p>but the most metabolically active cells in your entire body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Your rods and cones are the cells that demand,</p>
<p>and that use the most energy of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>not your skin cells,</p>
<p>not your spleen cells,</p>
<p>not your stomach cells.</p>
<p>Even if you talk a lot,</p>
<p>not the cells that are responsible for moving your mouth.</p>
<p>It is the rods and cones of your neural retina that are</p>
<p>responsible for using the most amount of ATP and energy in</p>
<p>your entire body.</p>
<p>And because of that,</p>
<p>those cells tend to accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen</p>
<p>species as we age.</p>
<p>Red light of the sort used in these studies was able to</p>
<p>reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species in the rods and</p>
<p>cones and to rescue the function of this particular cone</p>
<p>type, the short wavelength and medium wavelength cones,</p>
<p>which if you think about the study is a little bit</p>
<p>surprising because it was red light and near infrared light,</p>
<p>not short wavelength light that was used in order to create</p>
<p>this improvement in cellular function.</p>
<p>But if you step back a little bit further,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense because there&rsquo;s nothing specific</p>
<p>about the red light in the sense that it&rsquo;s not that it gets</p>
<p>delivered only to red cones,</p>
<p>that red light and near infrared light is being absorbed by</p>
<p>all the photoreceptors within the eye,</p>
<p>the rods and the blue cones and the green cones and the red</p>
<p>cones. It&rsquo;s just that the red cones absorb that light best.</p>
<p>So the important takeaway here is that viewing red light and</p>
<p>near infrared light at a distance at which it is safe for</p>
<p>just a couple of minutes each day allowed a reversal of the</p>
<p>aging process of these neurons,</p>
<p>which some people have heard me say before,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just say it again,</p>
<p>the retina, including your photoreceptors,</p>
<p>are not just connected to your brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just near your brain.</p>
<p>They are actual central nervous system tissue.</p>
<p>They are the only two pieces of your brain.</p>
<p>Many of your neural retinas are the only two pieces of your</p>
<p>brain that reside outside your skull,</p>
<p>or at least outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re seeing a reversal of the aging process in</p>
<p>neurons by shining red light on those neurons.</p>
<p>Now, of course,</p>
<p>the Jeffrey lab is primarily interested in vision and</p>
<p>humans are most dependent on vision as a sense to navigate</p>
<p>the world and survive. So this is really wonderful here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at a therapy that can reverse age-related</p>
<p>vision loss, at least in some individuals.</p>
<p>But as you can imagine,</p>
<p>the study was also done on these cells because they reside</p>
<p>outside the skull and you can shine light directly on them.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are many people out there who are</p>
<p>interested in how they can improve the function,</p>
<p>say of the neurons in their brain responsible for memory.</p>
<p>And in a few minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll describe the non-invasive applications of light to try</p>
<p>and restore the function of those cells as well.</p>
<p>So a little bit more about the studies from the Jeffrey lab.</p>
<p>One of the things that they observed was a reduction in so</p>
<p>called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.</p>
<p>Drusen are little fatty deposits,</p>
<p>little cholesterol deposits that accumulate in the eye.</p>
<p>As we age,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all heard about cholesterol within our veins and</p>
<p>arteries and how that can clog our veins and arteries and</p>
<p>how of course,</p>
<p>clogging of veins and arteries is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>our neural retina being so metabolically active requires a</p>
<p>lot of blood flow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavily vascularized and drusen are a special form of</p>
<p>cholesterol that accumulate in the eye.</p>
<p>As it turns out these red light and near infrared light</p>
<p>therapies explored by the Jeffrey lab,</p>
<p>were able to actually reduce or reverse some of the</p>
<p>accumulation of drusen.</p>
<p>And so in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>the idea in mind now is that red light may actually reduce</p>
<p>cholesterol deposits and reactive oxygen species in order to</p>
<p>improve neuronal function.</p>
<p>So what should you and I do with these results or should we</p>
<p>do anything with these results?</p>
<p>Well, first of all,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that even though these studies are very</p>
<p>exciting, they are fairly recent.</p>
<p>And so more data as always are needed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some additional features of these studies that I</p>
<p>think are also important to consider.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>the exposure to red light needed to happen early in the day,</p>
<p>at least within the first three hours of waking.</p>
<p>How would one do that?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>nowadays there are a number of different red light panels and</p>
<p>different red light sources that certainly fall within the</p>
<p>range of red light and near infrared light that one could</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation to any companies or products</p>
<p>that promote or make those red light therapies.</p>
<p>I do own a red light panel.</p>
<p>So I confess I have started using this protocol.</p>
<p>I am older than 40 years old.</p>
<p>I also have been experimenting with these red light panels as</p>
<p>a way of addressing other changes in biological tissues for</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m doing blood work, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about that in a future episode.</p>
<p>But that of course is what I call anecho data.</p>
<p>It only relates to my experience.</p>
<p>So today,</p>
<p>and certainly on all episodes of the human lab podcast,</p>
<p>we emphasize peer reviewed studies,</p>
<p>almost exclusively talking about anecho data only when</p>
<p>highlighting it as anecho data.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants to explore red light</p>
<p>therapy, here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that that red light source,</p>
<p>whatever source you happen to use,</p>
<p>whether or not you purchase it or make one.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>these red light sources are very, very easy to make.</p>
<p>You could essentially take a bright flashlight and cover it</p>
<p>with a film or a filter that would only allow particular</p>
<p>long wavelengths to pass through.</p>
<p>This would be very easy to look up online and figure out</p>
<p>how to do this.</p>
<p>You could probably do this for, you know,</p>
<p>just a few dollars,</p>
<p>or you could purchase a red light unit.</p>
<p>If that was within your budget and something that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interested in,</p>
<p>you want to make sure that it&rsquo;s not so bright that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>damaging your eye.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that something isn&rsquo;t painful to look</p>
<p>at. And in fact,</p>
<p>I should just emphasize that anytime you look at any light</p>
<p>source, sunlight, or otherwise that&rsquo;s painful,</p>
<p>it makes you want to squint or close your eyes.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s too bright to look at without closing your</p>
<p>eyes. Okay. That&rsquo;s sort of a duh,</p>
<p>but I would loathe to think that anyone would harm</p>
<p>themselves with bright light in any way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us.</p>
<p>I say that to protect you, of course,</p>
<p>because you are responsible for your health.</p>
<p>And again, retinal neurons do not regenerate.</p>
<p>Once they are gone and dead, they do not come back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no technology to replace them at this current state</p>
<p>in time.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t damage your retinas.</p>
<p>So is a red light source safe to look at if it is not</p>
<p>painful to look at?</p>
<p>Chances are it is.</p>
<p>And yet I would still encourage you to talk to your</p>
<p>optometrist or ophthalmologist before getting into any</p>
<p>extensive protocols.</p>
<p>But if you are still determined to pursue the sorts of</p>
<p>protocols that are in the Jeffrey studies,</p>
<p>certainly we&rsquo;ll provide a link to those studies.</p>
<p>Again, it involves looking at these red light panels,</p>
<p>blinking aloud for two minutes to three minutes,</p>
<p>every morning for a period of two weeks or more.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re older than 40,</p>
<p>that could very well have an effect.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re younger than 40, excuse me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unlikely to have an effect.</p>
<p>At least that was what was observed in these particular</p>
<p>studies.</p>
<p>The lights were not flashing.</p>
<p>It was continuous illumination.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re allowed to blink.</p>
<p>It does not have to even be direct illumination.</p>
<p>It can be somewhat indirect illumination,</p>
<p>much as we described for the use of UVB light before.</p>
<p>The wavelength of light is important.</p>
<p>It is red light and near infrared light that is going to be</p>
<p>effective in this scenario.</p>
<p>The authors of this study emphasized that it was red light</p>
<p>of 670 nanometers in wavelength and near infrared light of</p>
<p>790 nanometers in wavelength that were effective and that</p>
<p>those wavelengths could be complimentary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably why, or maybe it&rsquo;s just coincidental,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fortunate coincidence that a lot of the</p>
<p>commercially available red light panels that you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>out there combine both red light and near infrared light.</p>
<p>However, I want to emphasize that most of the panels that</p>
<p>are commercially available are going to be too bright to</p>
<p>safely look at very close up.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why most of those red light panels are designed for</p>
<p>illumination of the skin and oftentimes arrive in their</p>
<p>packaging with eye protectors that are actually designed to</p>
<p>shield out all the red light.</p>
<p>So take the potential dangers of excessive illumination of</p>
<p>the eyes with any wavelength of light seriously.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to explore 670 and 790 nanometer light</p>
<p>for sake of enhancing neuronal function,</p>
<p>set it at a distance that&rsquo;s comfortable to look at.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t force you to squint or doesn&rsquo;t make you</p>
<p>feel uncomfortable physically,</p>
<p>as if you need to turn away during the period of that two to</p>
<p>three minute illumination each day.</p>
<p>In terms of turning away from light,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just briefly mention that that is not an accident or a</p>
<p>coincidence that you have that response to very bright light.</p>
<p>There is a so-called photic avoidance pathway that involves</p>
<p>cells within your retina,</p>
<p>these ganglion cells that communicate with yet another brain</p>
<p>station, a certain area of your thalamus that communicate to</p>
<p>areas of your brain that are associated with pain.</p>
<p>So literally that can trigger headache and that can trigger</p>
<p>the squint reflex.</p>
<p>Biology is just beautiful in this way.</p>
<p>Too much light is bad for us in that it can damage our eyes</p>
<p>and other aspects of our body.</p>
<p>So if we look at a light, that&rsquo;s too bright,</p>
<p>our eyes send a signal to the brain that gives us a sort of a</p>
<p>headache and a desire to squint and turn away.</p>
<p>So that can be a useful guide in terms of gauging how bright</p>
<p>a light should be,</p>
<p>or at least how far away you should be from a bright source</p>
<p>in order to safely engage with that light source.</p>
<p>So the studies I just described, once again,</p>
<p>involve the use of red light early in the day,</p>
<p>within three hours of waking and are for the sake of</p>
<p>improving neuronal function.</p>
<p>Red light has also been shown to be beneficial late in the</p>
<p>day and even in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And when I say middle of the night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to studies that explore the use of red light</p>
<p>for shift workers.</p>
<p>I know that most people are not working in the middle of the</p>
<p>night, at least I hope they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>but some of you may do that from time to time.</p>
<p>All-nighters for studying, I confess,</p>
<p>I still pull all-nighters every once in a while to prepare</p>
<p>things like podcasts and other deadlines really try not to</p>
<p>happens less and less as I get older,</p>
<p>because I think I get more disciplined and,</p>
<p>or less good at pulling all-nighters.</p>
<p>But I realized that many people are doing shift work where</p>
<p>they have to work certainly past 10 PM,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re taking care of young children in the</p>
<p>middle of the night and they have to be up.</p>
<p>In that case, red light can actually be very beneficial.</p>
<p>And nowadays there are a lot of sources of red light</p>
<p>available just as red light bulbs.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a panel.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m basically saying is that it can be beneficial to</p>
<p>use red lights at night.</p>
<p>The study I&rsquo;d like to emphasize in this context is entitled</p>
<p>red light,</p>
<p>a novel non-pharmacological intervention to promote alertness</p>
<p>in shift workers.</p>
<p>So beautiful study,</p>
<p>they explored the use of different wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>So blue light of 460 nanometers or red light or dim white</p>
<p>light of different brightnesses, et cetera.</p>
<p>And looked at things like melatonin,</p>
<p>how much does light of a given color and intensity suppress</p>
<p>melatonin?</p>
<p>They looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.</p>
<p>They looked at wakefulness,</p>
<p>how much or to what degree could a given color of light</p>
<p>increase wakefulness at different hours of the day.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this study is very clear.</p>
<p>If you need to be awake late at night for sake of shift work</p>
<p>or studying or taking care of children, et cetera,</p>
<p>red light is going to be your best choice because if the red</p>
<p>light is sufficiently dim,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to inhibit melatonin production.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not going to increase cortisol at night.</p>
<p>Cortisol should be high early in the day,</p>
<p>or at least should be elevated relative to other times a</p>
<p>day. If you are healthy,</p>
<p>a late shifted increase in cortisol, however,</p>
<p>9 p.m. cortisol,</p>
<p>10 p.m. cortisol is well-known to be associated with</p>
<p>depression and other aspects of mental health rushes a</p>
<p>mental illness.</p>
<p>So if you do need to be awake at night or even all night,</p>
<p>red light is going to be the preferred light source.</p>
<p>And in terms of how bright to make it well,</p>
<p>as dim as you can,</p>
<p>while still being able to perform the activities that you</p>
<p>need to perform, that&rsquo;s going to be your best guide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this study as well.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a really important study because it emphasized</p>
<p>that there are forms of light,</p>
<p>red light provided it&rsquo;s dim that can allow you to stimulate</p>
<p>the alertness that light landing on the eyes can provide.</p>
<p>So it allows you to stay awake and to do whatever work that</p>
<p>you need to do.</p>
<p>It does not seem to alter melatonin production.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It does not seem to alter levels or timing of cortisol</p>
<p>production.</p>
<p>So yet another case where red light used correctly can be</p>
<p>beneficial.</p>
<p>Up until now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about the effects of shining different</p>
<p>wavelengths of light on the skin or on our eyes and the</p>
<p>downstream health consequences of that illumination.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>one of the most important goals of science and medicine is to</p>
<p>figure out how to change the health of our brain.</p>
<p>And of course our brain is contained within our skull and</p>
<p>therefore we can&rsquo;t just shine light onto the outside of our</p>
<p>head and expected to change the activity of neurons deep</p>
<p>within the brain,</p>
<p>unless those neurons are linked up with our eyes or with our</p>
<p>skin.</p>
<p>Because it turns out,</p>
<p>even though there are a lot of brain areas that are</p>
<p>connected through neural circuits and hormone circuits to</p>
<p>our eye and believe it or not also to our skin,</p>
<p>many brain areas are not brain areas,</p>
<p>such as the hippocampus,</p>
<p>which is involved in learning and memory brain areas,</p>
<p>such as our neocortex.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>some areas of our neocortex,</p>
<p>such as our visual cortex are indirectly linked to our eyes.</p>
<p>So if we shine light in our eyes,</p>
<p>we can change the activity of neurons in our neocortex,</p>
<p>but there are other brain areas that are not directly or</p>
<p>even indirectly connected to our visual system,</p>
<p>not at least in any immediate way.</p>
<p>So that raises the question of how do you change the</p>
<p>activity of neurons in the brain?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s pharmacology.</p>
<p>You can take pills,</p>
<p>you can inject drugs that will change the pharmacology of</p>
<p>neurons and the way they operate in fire.</p>
<p>Of course,</p>
<p>antidepressants are one such instance.</p>
<p>Opioid drugs are another,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge array of psychoactive compounds,</p>
<p>meaning compounds that will change the levels of chemicals</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>Some of those work.</p>
<p>Many of them also carry side effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all rather indirect,</p>
<p>meaning you have lots of different cells in different areas</p>
<p>of your brain that utilize the same chemicals.</p>
<p>So a drug, for instance,</p>
<p>to increase serotonin for sake of improving depression will</p>
<p>also often have the effect of reducing certain neurons</p>
<p>output of serotonin in the hippocampus and cause changes</p>
<p>in appetite or changes in libido and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You could imagine using electrical stimulation,</p>
<p>putting wires into the brain and stimulating specific brain</p>
<p>areas in order to activate the neurons in those brain areas.</p>
<p>And certainly that works and has been done experimentally</p>
<p>and is done during neurosurgery exams, et cetera,</p>
<p>but involves removing a piece of skull.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not very practical.</p>
<p>In principle,</p>
<p>light would be a wonderful way to modulate the activity of</p>
<p>neurons deep within the brain.</p>
<p>But again, the skull is in the way.</p>
<p>Recent studies, however,</p>
<p>have figured out ways that light can be delivered to the</p>
<p>eyes to change global patterns of firing in the brain in</p>
<p>ways that can be beneficial to the brain.</p>
<p>And the work that I&rsquo;m referring to now is mainly the work of</p>
<p>Li-Wei Tsai at MIT,</p>
<p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her colleagues.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ve discovered is that there&rsquo;s a particular</p>
<p>pattern of brain activity called gamma activity.</p>
<p>Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength of electrical</p>
<p>activity in the brain.</p>
<p>So not wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>but wavelengths of electrical activity in the brain that can</p>
<p>be restorative for certain aspects of learning and memory and</p>
<p>can actually help create molecular changes in neurons that</p>
<p>lead to clearance of debris and even reductions in age</p>
<p>related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So the way to think about brain waves and brain oscillations</p>
<p>is that neurons are electrically active that involves</p>
<p>chemicals, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they can be active in very slow, big wave forms.</p>
<p>So you can think of, you know, delta waves, meaning,</p>
<p>so you can imagine a wave of electrical activity that comes</p>
<p>along very infrequently.</p>
<p>So a given neuron fires and then some period of time later</p>
<p>fires, and then some period of time, even later fires,</p>
<p>or you can imagine that that same cell is very active fires,</p>
<p>fires, fires, fires, fires.</p>
<p>You can imagine if it&rsquo;s firing very often,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be short wavelength, right?</p>
<p>Shorter gaps between firing, or if it&rsquo;s firing very seldom,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to think about that as longer wavelength</p>
<p>firing turns out that gamma waves are one pattern of firing</p>
<p>that lead to downstream metabolic functions and biological</p>
<p>functions that end up clearing away debris that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with aging in cells.</p>
<p>And that also lead to molecular changes that enhance the kind</p>
<p>of youthfulness of neurons, so to speak.</p>
<p>How do we induce gamma oscillations within the brain?</p>
<p>Well, what Liwei, Tsai and colleagues have beautifully shown</p>
<p>is that by delivering certain patterns of light flicker,</p>
<p>so lights going on and off at a particular frequency,</p>
<p>the brain as a whole starts to entrain,</p>
<p>meaning it matches to those particular patterns of light</p>
<p>flicker, even though many of the brain areas that do this</p>
<p>are not directly within the visual system</p>
<p>or visual pathway.</p>
<p>So the studies that I&rsquo;m referred to are several,</p>
<p>but the one that I&rsquo;d like to highlight is entitled</p>
<p>gamma entrainment binds higher order brain regions</p>
<p>and offers neuro protection.</p>
<p>What they essentially did was to expose subjects to 40 Hertz,</p>
<p>which is a particular frequency of illumination to the eyes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s light goes on, light goes off, light goes on,</p>
<p>light goes off at a frequency of 40 Hertz.</p>
<p>And when they did that and they recorded the activity of</p>
<p>neurons within the brain,</p>
<p>not just within the visual areas of the brain,</p>
<p>but within other areas as well,</p>
<p>they observed increased gamma oscillations,</p>
<p>meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large</p>
<p>started to match to the patterns of light that were</p>
<p>delivered to the eyes.</p>
<p>This is really exciting and very unique from the different</p>
<p>types of phototherapies that we&rsquo;ve been talking about up</p>
<p>until now,</p>
<p>all the patterns of phototherapy that we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about up until now involved constant illumination with a</p>
<p>given wavelength here,</p>
<p>it is wavelength generating patterns of illumination light</p>
<p>on light off light on light off at a particular frequency.</p>
<p>So what they found for instance,</p>
<p>using this pattern of stimulation, and by the way,</p>
<p>the stimulation was called Janice gamma entrainment using</p>
<p>sensory stimulation.</p>
<p>So G E N U S gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation had</p>
<p>a number of really interesting effects.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>it reduced so-called amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau</p>
<p>amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau are associated with</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s and normal age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So this is incredible, right?</p>
<p>A pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes creates a</p>
<p>pattern of neuronal firing,</p>
<p>not just in the visual areas of the brain,</p>
<p>but in other areas of the brain as well,</p>
<p>that in turn trigger molecular pathways that reduce some of</p>
<p>the markers and the cause of age-related cognitive decline</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And in parallel to that,</p>
<p>they observed an up-regulation of some of the biological</p>
<p>pathways that lead to enhancement of neuronal function,</p>
<p>maintenance of synapses,</p>
<p>which are the connections between neurons and so on and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>They have discovered and list out a huge number of these</p>
<p>biological effects,</p>
<p>both the reduction in bad things, so to speak,</p>
<p>and the improvement in good biological pathways.</p>
<p>And I find these studies so exciting because first of all,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re non-invasive, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no drilling through the skull.</p>
<p>They are very tractable and in the experimental sense,</p>
<p>meaning that you could imagine that if 40 Hertz stimulation</p>
<p>turns out to be the very best stimulation protocol to induce</p>
<p>these gamma oscillations, well, great,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s non-invasive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fairly easy to explore 50 Hertz stimulation,</p>
<p>a hundred Hertz stimulation, 20 Hertz stimulation,</p>
<p>and to do that with different wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>the PsyLab and other labs are really starting to explore the</p>
<p>full range of variables that can impact oscillations within</p>
<p>the brain and their downstream consequences.</p>
<p>So again, this is phototherapy,</p>
<p>but phototherapy of a very different sort that we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>talking about up until now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s phototherapy designed to trigger activation of</p>
<p>biological pathways far away from the very tissue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being illuminated.</p>
<p>And it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms that we</p>
<p>were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>where illumination of the skin with UVB light is setting off</p>
<p>an enormous number of different cascades and different</p>
<p>organs and tissues, including the spleen, the testes,</p>
<p>the ovaries and so on.</p>
<p>So again, light has these powerful effects,</p>
<p>both locally on the cells that the light is delivered to,</p>
<p>but also systemically in terms of the cells that are</p>
<p>changing their electrical and chemical outputs are modifying</p>
<p>lots and lots of biological programs.</p>
<p>Is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet?</p>
<p>Well, that sort of depends on how adventurous you are right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>These studies are being explored in the context of clinical</p>
<p>trials in people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia and other forms</p>
<p>of neuronal degeneration.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous to look at a 40 Hertz flickering light?</p>
<p>Well, in general, the answer is going to be no.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re prone to epilepsy, for instance,</p>
<p>staring at a flickering light of a given continuous</p>
<p>frequency can induce seizure, right?</p>
<p>That might surprise some of you, but it shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because as this study illustrates,</p>
<p>and as anyone who&rsquo;s ever been out at night to a club or</p>
<p>something illustrates, when you look at a strobe light,</p>
<p>for instance, your whole world of visual perception changes,</p>
<p>but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music,</p>
<p>at which you perceive conversation,</p>
<p>at which you perceive the movement of your body actually</p>
<p>changes according to the patterns of visual flicker.</p>
<p>In most cases, strobe,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re using the sort of club dancing example,</p>
<p>your brain is in training to its outside environment.</p>
<p>So given the power of flickering lights to entrain brain</p>
<p>rhythms, I think at this stage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably too preliminary to really suggest a specific</p>
<p>protocol,</p>
<p>but I would definitely keep an eye out for these sorts of</p>
<p>studies.</p>
<p>They are coming out all the time.</p>
<p>And I think in a very short period,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see specific protocols that one could</p>
<p>potentially use even at home.</p>
<p>And of course these are non-invasive protocols in order to</p>
<p>place the brain into a particular state,</p>
<p>not just for sake of offsetting neurodegeneration,</p>
<p>but also for enhancing focus,</p>
<p>for enhancing the transition into sleep and other brain</p>
<p>states as well.</p>
<p>Today I covered what I would say is a lot of information.</p>
<p>My goal was to give you an understanding of how light can</p>
<p>be used to change the activities of cells organelles within</p>
<p>those cells, entire organs,</p>
<p>and how that can happen locally and systemically.</p>
<p>We talked about the power of light to impact our biology at</p>
<p>the endocrine level, neuronal level, immune level, mood,</p>
<p>et cetera,</p>
<p>through both illumination of the eyes and the skin and other</p>
<p>tissues as well.</p>
<p>I realized that even though this was a lot of information,</p>
<p>there are many aspects of phototherapy that I did not cover.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot of interest nowadays, for instance,</p>
<p>in the use of red light and other wavelength light therapies</p>
<p>for ovarian health and testicular health.</p>
<p>In fact, I get a lot of questions such as,</p>
<p>can red light be used to improve testosterone output?</p>
<p>And if so,</p>
<p>is that best accomplished by shining red light on the skin</p>
<p>or directly on the gonads, on the testicles?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover those data at a future time.</p>
<p>Right now, the studies that have been done in rodents,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think are easily enough translated to humans.</p>
<p>And the studies that are happening in humans now are</p>
<p>exciting in the sense that they hold a lot of potential,</p>
<p>but the data aren&rsquo;t clear yet.</p>
<p>However, the data using UVB on the skin of men and women in</p>
<p>order to increase hormone,</p>
<p>in particular testosterone and estrogen output,</p>
<p>those data I think are very exciting and very actionable.</p>
<p>We talked about those earlier.</p>
<p>So if you want more information on how phototherapy can be</p>
<p>used, certainly we will do another episode on phototherapy</p>
<p>in these other contexts.</p>
