    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett,</p>
<p>a professor of psychology at Northeastern University,</p>
<p>and one of the most brilliant and bold thinkers and scientists</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the author of a book that revolutionized</p>
<p>our understanding of emotion in the brain</p>
<p>called How Emotions Are Made.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s coming out with a new book called</p>
<p>Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain</p>
<p>that you can and should preorder now.</p>
<p>I got a chance to read it already,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the best short,</p>
<p>whirlwind introductions to the human brain I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p>It comes out on November 17th,</p>
<p>but again, if there&rsquo;s anybody worth supporting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Lisa, so please do preorder the book now.</p>
<p>Lisa and I agreed to speak once again</p>
<p>around the time of the book release,</p>
<p>especially because we felt that this first conversation</p>
<p>is good to release now,</p>
<p>since we talk about the divisive time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through in the United States,</p>
<p>leading up to the election.</p>
<p>And she gives me a whole new way to think about it</p>
<p>from a neuroscience perspective</p>
<p>that is ultimately inspiring of empathy,</p>
<p>compassion, and love.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to this episode.</p>
<p>First sponsor is Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>the all in one drink that I start every day with</p>
<p>to cover all my nutritional bases</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t otherwise get through my diet naturally.</p>
<p>Second is Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>low carb, keto friendly, delicious cereal</p>
<p>that I reward myself with after a productive day.</p>
<p>The cocoa flavor is my favorite.</p>
<p>Third sponsor is Cash App,</p>
<p>the app I use to send money to friends for food, drinks,</p>
<p>and unfortunately, for the many bets I have lost to them.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that the bold,</p>
<p>first principles way that Lisa approaches</p>
<p>our study of the brain is something that has inspired me</p>
<p>ever since I learned about her work.</p>
<p>And in fact, I invited her to speak at the AGI series</p>
<p>I organized at MIT several years ago.</p>
<p>But as a little twist, instead of a lecture,</p>
<p>we did a conversation in front of the class.</p>
<p>I think that was one of the early moments</p>
<p>that led me to start this very podcast.</p>
<p>It was scary and gratifying,</p>
<p>which is exactly what life is all about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of funny how life turns on little moments</p>
<p>like these that at the time don&rsquo;t seem to be anything</p>
<p>out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;ll talk a lot about the brain today,</p>
<p>do you think, let&rsquo;s ask the craziest question,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s other intelligent life</p>
<p>out there in the universe?</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve been asking myself lately</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s intelligent life on this planet.</p>
<p>You know, I have to think probabilities suggest yes.</p>
<p>And also, secretly, I think I just hope that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It would be really, I know scientists</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t supposed to have hopes and dreams,</p>
<p>but I think it would be really cool.</p>
<p>And I also think it would be really sad if it wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>If we really were alone, that would be,</p>
<p>that would seem profoundly sad, I think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exciting to you, not scary?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, you know, I take a lot of comfort and curiosity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great resource for dealing with stress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning all about mushrooms and octopuses</p>
<p>and, you know, all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>And so for me, this counts, I think, in the realm of awe.</p>
<p>But also, I think I&rsquo;m somebody who cultivates awe</p>
<p>deliberately on purpose to feel like a speck, you know?</p>
<p>I find it a relief occasionally.</p>
<p>To feel small.</p>
<p>To feel small in a profoundly large and interesting universe.</p>
<p>So, maybe to dig more technically on the question of intelligence,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s difficult for intelligent life to arise</p>
<p>like it did on Earth?</p>
<p>From everything you&rsquo;ve written and studied about the brain,</p>
<p>how magical of a thing is it in terms of the odds it takes to arise?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know, magic is just, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, I like a magic show as much as the next person.</p>
<p>My husband was a magician at one time.</p>
<p>But, you know, magic is just a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really understand how it works yet.</p>
<p>So I would say from what I understand,</p>
<p>there are some major steps in the course of evolution</p>
<p>that at the beginning of life,</p>
<p>the step from single cell to multicellular organisms,</p>
<p>things like that, which are really not known.</p>
<p>I think for me, the question is not so much what&rsquo;s the likelihood</p>
<p>that it would happen again as much as what are the steps</p>
<p>and how long would it take?</p>
<p>And if it were to happen again on Earth,</p>
<p>would we end up with the same menu of life forms</p>
<p>that we currently have now?</p>
<p>And I think the answer is probably no, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much about evolution</p>
<p>that is stochastic and driven by chance.</p>
<p>But the question is whether that menu</p>
<p>would be equally delicious,</p>
<p>meaning like there&rsquo;d be rich complexity of the kind of,</p>
<p>like would we get dolphins and humans</p>
<p>or whoever else falls in that category</p>
<p>of weirdly intelligent, seemingly intelligent?</p>
<p>However we define that.</p>
<p>Well, I think that has to be true.</p>
<p>If you just look at the range of creatures</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gone extinct.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the range of creatures</p>
<p>that are on the Earth now, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of tried to say that,</p>
<p>but it actually is really incredible.</p>
<p>Particularly, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, animals,</p>
<p>there are animals that seem really ordinary</p>
<p>until you watch them closely</p>
<p>and then they become miraculous,</p>
<p>like certain types of birds,</p>
<p>which do very miraculous things,</p>
<p>build bowers and do dances</p>
<p>and all these really funky things</p>
<p>that are hard to explain</p>
<p>with a standard evolutionary story,</p>
<p>although people have them.</p>
<p>Yeah, the birds are weird.</p>
<p>They do a lot for mating purposes.</p>
<p>They have a concept of beauty</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t quite, maybe you know much better,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit evolutionary arguments well.</p>
<p>It does fit.</p>
<p>Well, it depends, right?</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re talking about the evolution of beauty,</p>
<p>the book that was written recently by,</p>
<p>was it Frum, was that his name?</p>
<p>Richard Frum, I think, at Yale.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, no, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a great book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very controversial, though,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s making the argument</p>
<p>that the question about birds and some other animals</p>
<p>is why would they engage</p>
<p>in such metabolically costly displays</p>
<p>when it doesn&rsquo;t improve their fitness at all?</p>
<p>And the answer that he gives is the answer that Darwin gave,</p>
<p>which is sexual selection, not natural selection.</p>
<p>But selection can occur for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>There could be artificial selection,</p>
<p>which is when we breed animals, right?</p>
<p>Which is actually how Darwin,</p>
<p>that observation helped Darwin come to the idea</p>
<p>of natural selection.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s sexual selection,</p>
<p>meaning, and the argument that,</p>
<p>I think his name is Frum,</p>
<p>makes is that it&rsquo;s the pleasure,</p>
<p>the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birds.</p>
<p>Which, as a woman, and as someone who studies affect,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great answer.</p>
<p>I actually think there probably is natural,</p>
<p>I think there is an aspect of natural selection to it,</p>
<p>which he maybe hasn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<p>But you were saying the reason we brought up birds</p>
<p>is the life we&rsquo;ve got now seems to be quite incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he brought up birds,</p>
<p>now seems to be quite incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you peek into the ocean,</p>
<p>peek into the sky, there are miraculous creatures.</p>
<p>Look at creatures who&rsquo;ve gone extinct.</p>
<p>And in science fiction stories,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t dream up something as interesting.</p>
<p>So my guess is that intelligent life evolves</p>
<p>in many different ways, even on this planet.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one form of intelligence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one brain that gives you intelligence.</p>
<p>There are lots of different brain structures</p>
<p>that can give you intelligence.</p>
<p>So my guess is that the menagerie</p>
<p>might not look exactly the way that it looks now,</p>
<p>but it would certainly be as interesting.</p>
<p>But if we look at the human brain versus the brains,</p>
<p>or whatever you call them,</p>
<p>the mechanisms of intelligence in our ancestors,</p>
<p>even early ancestors,</p>
<p>that you write about, for example, in your new book,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between the fanciest brain we got,</p>
<p>which is the human brain,</p>
<p>and the ancestor brains that it came from?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go.</p>
<p>You go all the way back, right, in your book.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the interesting comparison, would you say?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the human brain</p>
<p>is the fanciest brain we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different</p>
<p>and pretty fancy,</p>
<p>and they can do some pretty amazing things</p>
<p>that we cannot do.</p>
<p>You know, we can&rsquo;t grow back limbs,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t change color and texture,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves</p>
<p>into a little crevice.</p>
<p>I mean, these are things that we invent,</p>
<p>these are like superhero abilities</p>
<p>that we invent in stories, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do any of those things.</p>
<p>And so the human brain is certainly,</p>
<p>we can certainly do some things</p>
<p>that other animals can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>That seemed pretty impressive to us.</p>
<p>But I would say that there are a number of animal brains</p>
<p>which seem pretty impressive to me</p>
<p>that can do interesting things</p>
<p>and really impressive things that we can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I mean, with your work on how emotions are made and so on,</p>
<p>you kind of repaint the view of the brain</p>
<p>as less glamorous, I suppose,</p>
<p>than you would otherwise think.</p>
<p>Or like, I guess you draw a thread</p>
<p>that connects all brains together</p>
<p>in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the human brain</p>
<p>is any less miraculous than anybody else would say.</p>
<p>I just think that there are other brain structures</p>
<p>which are also miraculous.</p>
<p>And I also think that there are a number of things</p>
<p>about the human brain which we share</p>
<p>with other vertebrates, other animals with backbones.</p>
<p>But that we share these miraculous things.</p>
<p>But we can do some things in abundance.</p>
<p>And we can also do some things with our brains together,</p>
<p>working together that other animals can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Or at least we haven&rsquo;t discovered their ability to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this social thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things you write about.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of the fact,</p>
<p>like the book Sapiens, and the fact that we&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to kind of connect, like network our brains together</p>
<p>like you write about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to stop saying that.</p>
<p>Is that like some kind of feature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built into there?</p>
<p>Is that unique to our human brains?</p>
<p>Like how do you make sense of that?</p>
<p>What I would say is that our ability</p>
<p>to coordinate with each other is not unique to humans.</p>
<p>There are lots of animals who can do that.</p>
<p>But what we do with that coordination is unique</p>
<p>because of some of the structural features in our brains.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that other animals</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have those structural features.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we have them in abundance.</p>
<p>So the human brain is not larger</p>
<p>than you would expect it to be for a primate of our size.</p>
<p>If you took a chimpanzee and you grew it</p>
<p>to the size of a human, that chimpanzee would have a brain</p>
<p>that was the size of a human brain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing special about our brain</p>
<p>in terms of its size.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about our brain</p>
<p>in terms of the basic blueprint</p>
<p>that builds our brain from an embryo</p>
<p>is the basic blueprint that builds all mammalian brains</p>
<p>and maybe even all vertebrate brains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that because of its size</p>
<p>and particularly because of the size</p>
<p>of the cerebral cortex, which is a part</p>
<p>that people mistakenly attribute to rationality.</p>
<p>Why mistakenly?</p>
<p>Is that where all the clever stuff happens?</p>
<p>Well, no, it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I will also say that lots of clever stuff happens</p>
<p>in animals who don&rsquo;t have a cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>But because of the size of the cerebral cortex</p>
<p>and because of some of the features</p>
<p>that are enhanced by that size,</p>
<p>that gives us the capacity to do things</p>
<p>like build civilizations and coordinate with each other,</p>
<p>not just to manipulate the physical world,</p>
<p>but to add to it in very profound ways.</p>
<p>Like, other animals can cooperate with each other</p>
<p>and use tools.</p>
<p>We draw a line in the sand and we make countries</p>
<p>and then we create citizens and immigrants.</p>
<p>But also ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, the countries are centered around the concept</p>
<p>of like ideas.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think a citizen is and an immigrant?</p>
<p>Those are ideas.</p>
<p>Those are ideas that we impose on reality</p>
<p>and make them real.</p>
<p>And then they have very, very serious and real effects,</p>
<p>physical effects on people.</p>
<p>What do you think about the idea</p>
<p>that a bunch of people have written about,</p>
<p>Dawkins with memes, which is like ideas are breeding.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re just like the canvas for ideas to breed</p>
<p>in our brains.</p>
<p>So this kind of network that you talk about of brains</p>
<p>is just a little canvas for ideas</p>
<p>to then compete against each other and so on.</p>
<p>I think as a rhetorical tool, it&rsquo;s cool to think that way.</p>
<p>So I think it was Michael Pollan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if it was in the Botany of Desire,</p>
<p>but it was in one of his early books on botany</p>
<p>and gardening where he wrote about plants</p>
<p>and he wrote about plants utilizing humans</p>
<p>for their own evolutionary purposes.</p>
<p>Which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>You can think about a human gut in a sense</p>
<p>as a propagation device for the seeds of tomatoes</p>
<p>and what have you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>So I think rhetorically it&rsquo;s an interesting device,</p>
<p>but ideas are, as far as I know, invented by humans,</p>
<p>propagated by humans.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re separate from human brains</p>
<p>in any way, although it is interesting</p>
<p>to think about it that way.</p>
<p>Well, of course, the ideas that are using your brain</p>
<p>to communicate and write excellent books.</p>
<p>And they basically picked you, Lisa,</p>
<p>as an effective communicator and thereby are winning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting worldview</p>
<p>to think that there&rsquo;s particular aspects of your brain</p>
<p>that are conducive to certain sets of ideas</p>
<p>and maybe those ideas will win out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the way that I would say it really though</p>
<p>is that there are many species of animals</p>
<p>that influence each other&rsquo;s nervous systems,</p>
<p>that regulate each other&rsquo;s nervous systems,</p>
<p>and they mainly do it by physical means.</p>
<p>They do it by chemicals, scent.</p>
<p>They do it by, so termites and ants and bees,</p>
<p>for example, use chemical scents.</p>
<p>Mammals like rodents use scent</p>
<p>and they also use hearing, audition,</p>
<p>and that little bit of vision.</p>
<p>Primates, nonhuman primates add vision, right?</p>
<p>And I think everybody uses touch.</p>
<p>Humans, as far as I know, are the only species</p>
<p>that use ideas and words to regulate each other, right?</p>
<p>I can text something to someone halfway around the world.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to hear my voice.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to see my face</p>
<p>and I can have an effect on their nervous system.</p>
<p>And ideas, the ideas that we communicate with words,</p>
<p>I mean, words are in a sense a way</p>
<p>for us to do mental telepathy with each other, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not the first person to say that obviously,</p>
<p>but how do I control your heart rate?</p>
<p>How do I control your breathing?</p>
<p>How do I control your actions with words?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because those words are communicating ideas.</p>
<p>So you also write, I think, let&rsquo;s go back to the brain.</p>
<p>You write that Plato gave us the idea</p>
<p>that the human brain has three brains in it, three forces,</p>
<p>which is kind of a compelling notion.</p>
<p>You disagree.</p>
<p>First of all, what are the three parts of the brain</p>
<p>and why do you disagree?</p>
<p>So Plato&rsquo;s description of the psyche,</p>
<p>which for the moment we&rsquo;ll just assume</p>
<p>is the same as a mind.</p>
<p>There are some scholars who would say a soul, a psyche,</p>
<p>a mind, those aren&rsquo;t actually all the same thing</p>
<p>in ancient Greece, but we&rsquo;ll just for now gloss over that.</p>
<p>So Plato&rsquo;s idea was that,</p>
<p>and it was a description of really about moral behavior</p>
<p>and moral responsibility in humans.</p>
<p>So the idea was that the human psyche can be described</p>
<p>with a metaphor of two horses and a charioteer.</p>
<p>So one horse for instincts,</p>
<p>like feeding and fighting and fleeing and reproduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to control my salty language,</p>
<p>which apparently they print in England.</p>
<p>Like I actually tossed off a fairly.</p>
<p>F, S?</p>
<p>Yeah, F, F, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, you printed that?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe you printed that.</p>
<p>Without like the stars or whatever?</p>
<p>No, no, no, it was full print.</p>
<p>They also printed a B word and it was really, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we should learn something from England.</p>
<p>Indeed, anyways, but instincts.</p>
<p>And then the other horse represents emotions.</p>
<p>And then the charioteer represents rationality,</p>
<p>which controls the two beasts, right?</p>
<p>And fast forward a couple of centuries</p>
<p>and in the middle of the 20th century,</p>
<p>there was a very popular view of brain evolution,</p>
<p>which suggested that you have this reptilian core,</p>
<p>like an inner lizard brain for instincts.</p>
<p>And then wrapped around that evolved,</p>
<p>layer on top of that evolved a limbic system in mammals.</p>
<p>So the novelty was in a mammalian brain,</p>
<p>which bestowed mammals with, gave them emotions,</p>
<p>the capacity for emotions.</p>
<p>And then on top of that evolved a cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>which in largely in primates, but very large in humans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I personally disagree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that as far back as the 1960s,</p>
<p>but really by the 1970s, it was shown pretty clearly</p>
<p>with evidence from molecular genetics.</p>
<p>So peering into cells in the brain</p>
<p>to look at the molecular makeup of genes</p>
<p>that the brain did not evolve that way.</p>
<p>And the irony is that the idea of the three layered brain</p>
<p>with an inner lizard that hijacks your behavior</p>
<p>and causes you to do and say things</p>
<p>that you would otherwise not,</p>
<p>or maybe that you will regret later.</p>
<p>That idea became very popular,</p>
<p>was popularized by Carl Sagan in The Dragons of Eden,</p>
<p>which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977,</p>
<p>when it was already known pretty much</p>
<p>in evolutionary neuroscience</p>
<p>that the whole narrative was a myth.</p>
<p>So what the narrative is on the way it evolved,</p>
<p>but do you, I mean, again, it&rsquo;s that problem</p>
<p>of it being a useful tool of conversation</p>
<p>to say like there&rsquo;s a lizard brain</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a, like if I get overly emotional on Twitter,</p>
<p>that was the lizard brain and so on.</p>
<p>But do you?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think that.</p>
<p>Is it useful, is it accurate?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s accurate,</p>
<p>and therefore I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>I think that the way I think about philosophy and science</p>
<p>is that they are useful tools for living.</p>
<p>And in order to be useful tools for living,</p>
<p>they have to help you make good decisions.</p>
<p>The triune brain, as it&rsquo;s called, this three layer brain,</p>
<p>the idea that your brain is like an already baked cake</p>
<p>and the cortex, cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>just layered on top like icing.</p>
<p>The idea, that idea is the foundation of the law</p>
<p>in most Western countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the foundation of economic theory</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great narrative.</p>
<p>It sort of fits in with what I&rsquo;ve been saying</p>
<p>fits our intuitions about how we work.</p>
<p>But it also, in addition to being wrong,</p>
<p>it lets people off the hook for nasty behavior.</p>
<p>And it also suggests that emotions</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be a source of wisdom, which they often are.</p>
<p>In fact, you would not wanna be around someone</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t have emotions.</p>
<p>That would be, that&rsquo;s a psychopath.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not someone you wanna really</p>
<p>have that person deciding your outcome.</p>
<p>So I guess my, and I could sort of go on and on and on,</p>
<p>but my point is that I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a useful narrative in the end.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the more accurate view of the brain</p>
<p>that we should use when we&rsquo;re thinking about it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer that in a second,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say that even our notion of what an instinct is</p>
<p>or what a reflex is, it&rsquo;s not quite right, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at evidence from ecology, for example,</p>
<p>and you look at animals in their ecological context,</p>
<p>what you can see is that even things</p>
<p>which are reflexes are very context sensitive.</p>
<p>The brains of those animals are executing</p>
<p>so called instinctual actions</p>
<p>in a very, very context sensitive way.</p>
<p>And so even when a physician takes the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the idea of your patellar reflex</p>
<p>where they hit your patellar tendon on your knee</p>
<p>and you kick, the force with which you kick and so on</p>
<p>is influenced by all kinds of things.</p>
<p>A reflex isn&rsquo;t like a robotic response.</p>
<p>And so I think a better way is a way that,</p>
<p>to think about how brains work,</p>
<p>is the way that matches our best understanding,</p>
<p>our best scientific understanding,</p>
<p>which I think is really cool</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really counterintuitive.</p>
<p>So how I came to this view,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not the only one who holds this view.</p>
<p>I was reading work on neuroanatomy</p>
<p>and the view that I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>was strongly suggested by that.</p>
<p>And then I was reading work in signal processing,</p>
<p>like by electrical engineering.</p>
<p>And similarly, the work suggested that,</p>
<p>the research suggested that the brain worked this way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just say that I was reading</p>
<p>across multiple literatures</p>
<p>and they were who don&rsquo;t speak to each other</p>
<p>and they were all pointing in this direction.</p>
<p>And so far, although some of the details</p>
<p>are still up for grabs,</p>
<p>the general gist I think is I&rsquo;ve not come across anything yet</p>
<p>which really violates, and I&rsquo;m looking.</p>
<p>And so the idea is something like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>So the way to describe it is to say</p>
<p>that your brain doesn&rsquo;t react to things in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, to us it feels like our eyes</p>
<p>are windows on the world.</p>
<p>We see things, we hear things, we react to them.</p>
<p>In psychology, we call this stimulus response.</p>
<p>So your face, your voice is a stimulus to me.</p>
<p>I receive input and then I react to it.</p>
<p>And I might react very automatically, system one.</p>
<p>But I also might execute some control</p>
<p>where I maybe stop myself from saying something</p>
<p>or doing something and in a more reflective way</p>
<p>execute a different action, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s system two.</p>
<p>The way the brain works though,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s predicting all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly talking to itself,</p>
<p>constantly talking to your body,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s constantly predicting what&rsquo;s going on in the body</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in the world and making predictions</p>
<p>and the information from your body and from the world</p>
<p>really confirm or correct those predictions.</p>
<p>So fundamentally the thing that the brain does</p>
<p>most of the time is just like talking to itself</p>
<p>and predicting stuff about the world,</p>
<p>not like this dumb thing that just senses and responds,</p>
<p>senses and responds.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the way to think about it is like this.</p>
<p>You know, your brain is trapped in a dark silent box.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very romantic of you.</p>
<p>Which is your skull.</p>
<p>And the only information that it receives</p>
<p>from your body and from the world, right,</p>
<p>is through the senses, through the sense organs,</p>
<p>your eyes, your ears,</p>
<p>and you have sensory data that comes from your body</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re largely unaware of to your brain,</p>
<p>which we call interoceptive,</p>
<p>as opposed to exteroceptive, which is the world around you.</p>
<p>But your brain is receiving sense data continuously,</p>
<p>which are the effect of some set of causes.</p>
<p>Your brain doesn&rsquo;t know the cause of these sense data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only receiving the effects of those causes,</p>
<p>which are the data themselves.</p>
<p>And so your brain has to solve what philosophers call</p>
<p>an inverse inference problem.</p>
<p>How do you know, when you only receive</p>
<p>the effects of something,</p>
<p>how do you know what caused those effects?</p>
<p>So when there&rsquo;s a flash of light or a change in air pressure</p>
<p>or a tug somewhere in your body,</p>
<p>how does your brain know what caused those events</p>
<p>so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well?</p>
<p>And the answer is that your brain has one other source</p>
<p>of information available to it,</p>
<p>which is your past experience.</p>
<p>It can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences,</p>
<p>and it can combine those past experiences in novel ways.</p>
<p>And so we have lots of names for this in psychology.</p>
<p>We call it memory.</p>
<p>We call it perceptual inference.</p>
<p>We call it simulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge.</p>
<p>We call it prediction.</p>
<p>Basically, if we were to stop the world right now,</p>
<p>stop time, your brain is in a state,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s representing what it believes</p>
<p>is going on in your body and in the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s predicting what will happen next</p>
<p>based on past experience, right?</p>
<p>Probabilistically, what&rsquo;s most likely to happen.</p>
<p>And it begins to prepare your action,</p>
<p>and it begins to prepare your experience based,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s anticipating the sense data it&rsquo;s going to receive.</p>
<p>And then when those data come in,</p>
<p>they either confirm that prediction</p>
<p>and your action executes</p>
<p>because the plan&rsquo;s already been made,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s some sense data that your brain didn&rsquo;t predict</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unexpected, and your brain takes it in.</p>
<p>We say encodes it.</p>
<p>We have a fancy name for that.</p>
<p>We call it learning.</p>
<p>Your brain learns,</p>
<p>and it updates its storehouse of knowledge,</p>
<p>which we call an internal model</p>
<p>so that you can predict better next time.</p>
<p>And it turns out that predicting and correcting,</p>
<p>predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically</p>
<p>efficient way to run a system</p>
<p>than constantly reacting all the time.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re constantly reacting,</p>
<p>it means you can&rsquo;t anticipate in any way</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And so the amount of uncertainty that you have to deal with</p>
<p>is overwhelming to a nervous system.</p>
<p>Metabolically costly.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>And so what is a reflex?</p>
<p>A reflex is when your brain doesn&rsquo;t check</p>
<p>against the sense data.</p>
<p>That the potential cost to you is so great,</p>
<p>maybe because your life is threatened,</p>
<p>that your brain makes the prediction</p>
<p>and executes the action without checking.</p>
<p>Yeah, so but prediction is still at the core.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful vision of the brain.</p>
<p>I wonder, from almost an AI perspective,</p>
<p>but just computationally,</p>
<p>is the brain just mostly a prediction machine then?</p>
<p>Like is the perception just the nice little feature</p>
<p>added on top?</p>
<p>Like the, both the integration</p>
<p>of new perceptual information.</p>
<p>I wonder how big of an impressive system is that</p>
<p>relative to just the big predictor, model constructor.</p>
<p>Well, I think that we can look to evolution for that,</p>
<p>for one answer, which is that when you go back,</p>
<p>you know, 550 million years, give or take,</p>
<p>we, you know, the world was populated by creatures,</p>
<p>really ruled by creatures without brains.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s a biological statement,</p>
<p>not a political statement.</p>
<p>Really ruled with creatures with a.</p>
<p>You calling dinosaurs dumb?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about like.</p>
<p>Oh no, I&rsquo;m not talking about dinosaurs, honey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking way back, further back than that.</p>
<p>Really these, there are these little,</p>
<p>little creatures called amphioxus,</p>
<p>which is the modern, it&rsquo;s a, or a lancet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the modern animal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an animal that scientists believe is very similar</p>
<p>to our common,</p>
<p>the common ancestor that we share with invertebrates</p>
<p>because, basically because of the tracing back,</p>
<p>the molecular genetics and cells.</p>
<p>And that animal had no brain.</p>
<p>It had some cells that would later turn into a brain,</p>
<p>but in that animal, there&rsquo;s no brain,</p>
<p>but that animal also had no head,</p>
<p>and it had no eyes, and it had no ears,</p>
<p>and it had really, really no senses for the most part.</p>
<p>It had very, very limited sense of touch.</p>
<p>It had an eye spot for, not for seeing,</p>
<p>but just for entraining to circadian rhythm,</p>
<p>to light and dark.</p>
<p>And it had no hearing.</p>
<p>It had a vestibular cell</p>
<p>so that it could keep upright in the water.</p>
<p>So at the time, we&rsquo;re talking evolutionary scale here,</p>
<p>so give or take some 100 million years or something,</p>
<p>but at the time, what are the vertebrate,</p>
<p>like when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved,</p>
<p>a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs</p>
<p>and when that&rsquo;s when your viscera,</p>
<p>like internal systems involved.</p>
<p>So the answer I would say is that senses,</p>
<p>motor neuroscientists,</p>
<p>people who study the control of motor behavior</p>
<p>believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action.</p>
<p>So the idea is that,</p>
<p>like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change?</p>
<p>What was the big pressure that made it useful</p>
<p>to have eyes and ears and a visual system</p>
<p>and an auditory system and a brain basically?</p>
<p>And the answer that is commonly entertained right now</p>
<p>is that it was predation,</p>
<p>that when at some point an animal evolved</p>
<p>that deliberately ate another animal</p>
<p>and this launched an arms race between predators and prey</p>
<p>and it became very useful to have senses, right?</p>
<p>So these little amphioxies don&rsquo;t really have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not aware of their environment very much, really.</p>
<p>And so being able to look up ahead and ask yourself,</p>
<p>should I eat that or will it eat me is a very useful thing.</p>
<p>So the idea is that sense data</p>
<p>is not there for consciousness.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t evolve for the purposes of consciousness.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t evolve for the purposes of experiencing anything.</p>
<p>It evolved to be in the service of motor control.</p>
<p>However, maybe it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>This is why scientists sometimes avoid questions</p>
<p>about why things evolved.</p>
<p>This is what philosophers call this teleology.</p>
<p>You might be able to say something about how things evolve,</p>
<p>but not necessarily why.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know the why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all speculation.</p>
<p>But the why is kind of nice here.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is,</p>
<p>that was the first element of social interaction is,</p>
<p>am I gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me?</p>
<p>And for that, it&rsquo;s useful to be able to see each other,</p>
<p>sense each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of fascinating that there was a time</p>
<p>when life didn&rsquo;t eat each other.</p>
<p>Or they did by accident.</p>
<p>So an amphioxus, for example,</p>
<p>it kind of like gyrates in the water,</p>
<p>and then it plants itself in the sand</p>
<p>like a living blade of grass,</p>
<p>and then it just filters whatever comes into its mouth.</p>
<p>So it is eating, but it&rsquo;s not actively hunting.</p>
<p>And when the concentration of food decreases,</p>
<p>the amphioxus can sense this.</p>
<p>And so it basically wriggles itself randomly</p>
<p>to some other spot,</p>
<p>which probabilistically will have more food</p>
<p>than wherever it is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not guiding its actions on the basis of,</p>
<p>we would say there&rsquo;s no real intentional action</p>
<p>in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Speaking of intentional action, and if the brain is,</p>
<p>if prediction is indeed a core component of the brain,</p>
<p>let me ask you a question that scientists also hate</p>
<p>is about free will.</p>
<p>So how does, do you think about free will much?</p>
<p>How does that fit into this, into your view of the brain?</p>
<p>Why does it feel like we make decisions in this world?</p>
<p>This is a hard, we scientists hate this,</p>
<p>this is a hard question we don&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>
<p>Have you taken a side?</p>
<p>I think I have. Do you have free will?</p>
<p>I think I have taken a side,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t put a lot of stock in my own intuitions</p>
<p>or anybody&rsquo;s intuitions about the cause of things.</p>
<p>One thing we know about the brain for sure</p>
<p>is that the brain creates experiences for us.</p>
<p>My brain creates experiences for me,</p>
<p>your brain creates experiences for you</p>
<p>in a way that lures you to believe that those experiences</p>
<p>actually reveals the way that it works,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t trust your own intuition about free will?</p>
<p>Not really, not really.</p>
<p>No, I mean, no, but I am also somewhat persuaded by,</p>
<p>I think Dan Dennett wrote at one point,</p>
<p>the philosopher Dan Dennett wrote at one point that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say it as eloquently as him,</p>
<p>but people obviously have free will,</p>
<p>they are obviously making choices.</p>
<p>So there is this observation that we&rsquo;re not robots</p>
<p>and we can do some things</p>
<p>like a little more sophisticated than an amphioxus.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>I would say that your predictions,</p>
<p>your internal model that&rsquo;s running right now,</p>
<p>your ability to understand the sounds that I&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>and attach them to ideas is based on the fact</p>
<p>that you have years of experience</p>
<p>knowing what these sounds mean</p>
<p>in a particular statistical pattern, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how you can understand the words</p>
<p>that are coming out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Right, I think we did this once before too, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>When we were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I would have to access my memory module.</p>
<p>I think when I was in your, when I.</p>
<p>The class thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we did it just like that actually, so bravo.</p>
<p>Wow, I have to go look back to the tape.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyways, the idea though</p>
<p>is that your brain is using past experience</p>
<p>and it can use past experience in,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s remembering, but you&rsquo;re not consciously remembering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically re implementing prior experiences</p>
<p>as a way of predicting what&rsquo;s gonna happen next.</p>
<p>And it can do something called conceptual combination,</p>
<p>which is it can take bits and pieces of the past</p>
<p>and combine it in new ways.</p>
<p>So you can experience and make sense of things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve encountered something similar to them.</p>
<p>And so a brain in a sense is not just,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just contain information.</p>
<p>It is information gaining,</p>
<p>meaning it can create new information</p>
<p>by this generative process.</p>
<p>So in a sense, you could say, well,</p>
<p>that maybe that&rsquo;s a source of free will.</p>
<p>But I think really where free will comes from</p>
<p>or the kind of free will that I think</p>
<p>is worth having a conversation about</p>
<p>involves cultivating experiences for yourself</p>
<p>that change your internal model.</p>
<p>When you were born and you were raised</p>
<p>in a particular context, your brain wired itself</p>
<p>to your surroundings, to your physical surroundings</p>
<p>and also to your social surroundings.</p>
<p>So you were handed an internal model basically.</p>
<p>But when you grow up,</p>
<p>the more control you have over where you are</p>
<p>and what you do, you can cultivate new experiences</p>
<p>for yourself.</p>
<p>And those new experiences can change your internal model.</p>
<p>And you can actually practice those experiences</p>
<p>in a way that makes them automatic,</p>
<p>meaning it makes it easier for the brain,</p>
<p>your brain to make them again.</p>
<p>And I think that that is something like</p>
<p>what you would call free will.</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t responsible for the model that you were handed,</p>
<p>that someone, your caregivers cultivated a model</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not responsible for that model,</p>
<p>but you are responsible for the one you have now.</p>
<p>You can choose, you choose what you expose yourself to.</p>
<p>You choose how you spend your time.</p>
<p>Not everybody has choice over everything,</p>
<p>but everybody has a little bit of choice.</p>
<p>And so I think that is something that I think</p>
<p>is arguably called free will.</p>
<p>Yeah, the ripple effects of the billions of decisions</p>
<p>you make early on in life are so great</p>
<p>that even if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s like all deterministic,</p>
<p>just the amount of possibilities that are created</p>
<p>and then the focusing on those possibilities</p>
<p>into a single trajectory,</p>
<p>that somewhere within that, that&rsquo;s free will.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s all deterministic,</p>
<p>that might as well be just the number of choices</p>
<p>that are possible and the fact that you just make</p>
<p>one trajectory to those set of choices</p>
<p>seems to be like something like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be called free will.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still kind of sad to think like</p>
<p>there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a place</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s magic in there,</p>
<p>where it is all just the computer.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s lots of magic, I would say, so far,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>how all of this is exactly played out at a,</p>
<p>I mean, scientists are working hard</p>
<p>and disagree about some of the details</p>
<p>under the hood of what I just described,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s quite a bit of magic actually.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s also stochastic firing of,</p>
<p>neurons don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not purely digital</p>
<p>in the sense that there is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also analog communication between neurons,</p>
<p>not just digital.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just with firing of axons.</p>
<p>And some of that, there are other ways to communicate.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s noise in the system</p>
<p>and the noise is there for a really good reason.</p>
<p>And that is the more variability there is,</p>
<p>the more potential there is for your brain</p>
<p>to be able to be information bearing.</p>
<p>So basically, there are some animals</p>
<p>that have clusters of cells.</p>
<p>The only job is to inject noise.</p>
<p>You know, into their neural patterns.</p>
<p>So maybe noise is the source of free will.</p>
<p>So you can think about stochasticity or noise</p>
<p>as a source of free will,</p>
<p>or you can think of conceptual combination</p>
<p>as a source of free will.</p>
<p>You can certainly think about cultivating,</p>
<p>you know, you can&rsquo;t reach back into your past</p>
<p>and change your past.</p>
<p>You know, people try by psychotherapy and so on,</p>
<p>but what you can do is change your present,</p>
<p>which becomes your past.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So one way to think about it is that you&rsquo;re continuously,</p>
<p>this is a colleague of mine, a friend of mine said,</p>
<p>so what you&rsquo;re saying is that people</p>
<p>are continually cultivating their past.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s very poetic.</p>
<p>Yes, you are continually cultivating your past</p>
<p>as a means of controlling your future.</p>
<p>So you think, yeah, I guess the construction</p>
<p>of the mental model that you use for prediction</p>
<p>ultimately contains within it your perception of the past,</p>
<p>like the way you interpret the past,</p>
<p>or even just the entirety of your narrative about the past.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re constantly rewriting the story of your past.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one poetic and also just awe inspiring.</p>
<p>What about the other thing you talk about?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned about sensory perception</p>
<p>as a thing that like is just,</p>
<p>you have to infer about the sources of the thing</p>
<p>that you have perceived through your senses.</p>
<p>So let me ask another ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Is anything real at all?</p>
<p>Like, how do we know it&rsquo;s real?</p>
<p>How do we make sense of the fact that just like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this brain sitting alone in the darkness</p>
<p>trying to perceive the world.</p>
<p>How do we know that the world is out there to be perceived?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t think that you should be asking questions</p>
<p>like that without passing a joint.</p>
<p>Right, no, for sure.</p>
<p>I actually did before this, so I apologize.</p>
<p>Okay, no, well, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You apologize for not sharing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>What I would say is that the reason why</p>
<p>we can be pretty sure that there&rsquo;s a there there</p>
<p>is that the structure of the information in the world,</p>
<p>what we call statistical regularities</p>
<p>in sights and sounds and so on,</p>
<p>and the structure of the information</p>
<p>that comes from your body, it&rsquo;s not random stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a structure to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spatial structure and a temporal structure.</p>
<p>And that spatial and temporal structure wires your brain.</p>
<p>So an infant brain is not a miniature adult brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brain that is waiting for wiring instructions</p>
<p>from the world.</p>
<p>And it must receive those wiring instructions</p>
<p>to develop in a typical way.</p>
<p>So, for example, when a newborn is born,</p>
<p>when a newborn is born, when a baby is born,</p>
<p>the baby can&rsquo;t see very well</p>
<p>because the visual system in that baby&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>is not complete.</p>
<p>The retina of your eye, which actually is part of your brain,</p>
<p>has to be stimulated with photons of light.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not, the baby won&rsquo;t develop normally</p>
<p>to be able to see in a neurotypical way.</p>
<p>Same thing is true for hearing.</p>
<p>The same thing is true really for all your senses.</p>
<p>So the point is that the physical world</p>
<p>the physical world, the sense data from the physical world</p>
<p>wires your brain so that you have an internal model</p>
<p>of that world so that your brain can predict well</p>
<p>to keep you alive and well and allow you to thrive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that the brain is waiting</p>
<p>for a very specific kind of set of instructions</p>
<p>from the world.</p>
<p>Like not the specific,</p>
<p>but a very specific kind of instructions.</p>
<p>So scientists call it expectable input.</p>
<p>The brain needs some input in order to develop normally.</p>
<p>And we are genetically, as I say in the book,</p>
<p>we have the kind of nature that requires nurture.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t develop normally without sensory input</p>
<p>from the world and from the body.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting about humans</p>
<p>and some other animals too, but really seriously in humans,</p>
<p>is the input that we need is not just physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also social.</p>
<p>We, in order for an infant, a human infant</p>
<p>to develop normally, that infant needs eye contact, touch.</p>
<p>It needs certain types of smells.</p>
<p>It needs to be cuddled.</p>
<p>It needs, right?</p>
<p>So without social input,</p>
<p>that infant&rsquo;s brain will not wire itself</p>
<p>in a neurotypical way.</p>
<p>And again, I would say there are lots</p>
<p>of cultural patterns of caring for an infant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the infant has to be cared for in one way.</p>
<p>Whatever the social environment is for an infant,</p>
<p>that will be reflected in that infant&rsquo;s internal model.</p>
<p>So we have lots of different cultures,</p>
<p>lots of different ways of rearing children.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an advantage for our species,</p>
<p>although we don&rsquo;t always experience it that way.</p>
<p>That is an advantage for our species.</p>
<p>But if you just feed and water a baby</p>
<p>without all the extra social doodads,</p>
<p>what you get is a profoundly impaired human.</p>
<p>Yeah, but nevertheless, you&rsquo;re kind of saying</p>
<p>that the physical reality has a consistent thing</p>
<p>throughout that keeps feeding these set</p>
<p>of sensory information that our brains are constructed for.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cool thing though,</p>
<p>is that if you change the consistency,</p>
<p>if you change the statistical regularities,</p>
<p>so prediction error, your brain can learn it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expensive for your brain to learn it.</p>
<p>And it takes a while for the brain</p>
<p>to get really automated with it.</p>
<p>But you had a wonderful conversation with David Edelman,</p>
<p>who just published a book about this</p>
<p>and gave lots and lots of really very, very cool examples.</p>
<p>Some of which I actually discussed</p>
<p>in How Emotions Were Made,</p>
<p>but not obviously to the extent that he did in his book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating book,</p>
<p>but it speaks to the point that your internal model</p>
<p>is always under construction.</p>
<p>And therefore, you always can modify your experience.</p>
<p>I wonder what the limits are.</p>
<p>Like if we put it on Mars or if we put it in virtual reality</p>
<p>or if we sit at home during a pandemic</p>
<p>and we spend most of our day on Twitter and TikTok,</p>
<p>like I wonder where the breaking point,</p>
<p>like the limitations of the brain&rsquo;s capacity</p>
<p>to properly continue wiring itself.</p>
<p>Well, I think what I would say is that</p>
<p>there are different ways to specify your question, right?</p>
<p>Like one way to specify it</p>
<p>would be the way that David phrases it,</p>
<p>which is can we create a new sense?</p>
<p>Like can we create a new sensory modality?</p>
<p>How hard would that be?</p>
<p>What are the limits in doing that?</p>
<p>But another way to say it is what happens to a brain</p>
<p>when you remove some of those statistical regularities,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like what happens to an adult brain</p>
<p>when you remove some of the statistical patterns</p>
<p>that were there and they&rsquo;re not there anymore?</p>
<p>Are you talking about in the environment</p>
<p>or in the actual like you remove eyesight, for example?</p>
<p>Well, either way.</p>
<p>I mean, basically one way to limit the inputs to your brain</p>
<p>are to stay home and protect yourself.</p>
<p>Another way is to put someone in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Another way is to stick them in a nursing home.</p>
<p>Well, not all nursing homes, but there are some, right?</p>
<p>Which really are where people are somewhat impoverished</p>
<p>in the interactions and the variety</p>
<p>of sensory stimulation that they get.</p>
<p>Another way is that you lose a sense, right?</p>
<p>But the point is I think that the human brain</p>
<p>really likes variety, to say it in a sort of Cartesian way.</p>
<p>Variety is a good thing for a brain.</p>
<p>And there are risks that you take</p>
<p>when you restrict what you expose yourself to.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, there&rsquo;s all this talk of diversity.</p>
<p>The brain loves it to the fullest definition</p>
<p>and degree of diversity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I would say the only thing,</p>
<p>basically human brains thrive on diversity.</p>
<p>The only place where we seem to have difficulty</p>
<p>with diversity is with each other, right?</p>
<p>But who wants to eat the same food every day?</p>
<p>You never would.</p>
<p>Who wants to wear the same clothes every day?</p>
<p>I mean, my husband, if you ask him to close his eyes,</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t be able to tell you what he&rsquo;s wearing, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll buy seven shirts of exactly the same style</p>
<p>in different colors, but they are in different colors, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s wearing.</p>
<p>How would you then explain my brain,</p>
<p>which is terrified of choice</p>
<p>and therefore wear the same thing every time?</p>
<p>Well, you must be getting your diversity.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you are a fairly sharp dresser,</p>
<p>so there is that, but you&rsquo;re getting some reinforcement</p>
<p>for dressing the way you do.</p>
<p>But no, your brain must get diversity in other places.</p>
<p>But I think we, you know,</p>
<p>so the two most expensive things your brain can do,</p>
<p>metabolically speaking, is move your body and learn.</p>
<p>And learn something new.</p>
<p>So novelty, that is diversity, right,</p>
<p>comes at a cost, a metabolic cost,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a cost, it&rsquo;s an investment that gives returns.</p>
<p>And in general, people vary</p>
<p>in how much they like novelty, unexpected things.</p>
<p>Some people really like it.</p>
<p>Some people really don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s everybody in between.</p>
<p>But in general, we don&rsquo;t eat the same thing every day.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t usually do exactly the same thing</p>
<p>in exactly the same order,</p>
<p>in exactly the same place every day.</p>
<p>The only place we have difficulty</p>
<p>with diversity is in each other.</p>
<p>And then we have considerable problems there,</p>
<p>I would say, as a species.</p>
<p>Let me ask, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s work about questions of reality.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts of the possibility</p>
<p>that the very thing we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>of the brain wiring itself from birth</p>
<p>to a particular set of inputs,</p>
<p>is just a little slice of reality,</p>
<p>that there is something much bigger out there</p>
<p>that we humans, with our cognition, cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>is just not even perceiving.</p>
<p>The thing we&rsquo;re perceiving is just a crappy,</p>
<p>like Windows 95 interface onto a much bigger,</p>
<p>richer set of complex physics</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not even in touch with.</p>
<p>Well, without getting too metaphysical about it,</p>
<p>I think we know for sure.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the crappy version of anything,</p>
<p>but we definitely have a limited,</p>
<p>we have a set of senses that are limited</p>
<p>in very physical ways,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re clearly not perceiving everything</p>
<p>there is to perceive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, without special,</p>
<p>why do we invent scientific tools?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so that we can overcome our senses</p>
<p>and experience things that we couldn&rsquo;t otherwise,</p>
<p>whether they are different parts of the visual spectrum,</p>
<p>the light spectrum,</p>
<p>or things that are too microscopically small for us to see</p>
<p>or too far away for us to see.</p>
<p>So clearly, we&rsquo;re only getting a slice,</p>
<p>and that slice,</p>
<p>the interesting or potentially sad thing about humans</p>
<p>is that we, whatever we experience,</p>
<p>we think there&rsquo;s a natural reason for experiencing it,</p>
<p>and we think it&rsquo;s obvious and natural</p>
<p>and it must be this way,</p>
<p>and that all the other stuff isn&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s clearly not true.</p>
<p>Many of the things that we think of as natural</p>
<p>are anything but,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re certainly real, but we&rsquo;ve created them.</p>
<p>They certainly have very real impacts,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve created those impacts.</p>
<p>And we also know that there are many things</p>
<p>outside of our awareness that have tremendous influence</p>
<p>on what we experience and what we do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, just, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but the extent is how, really the question is,</p>
<p>how fantastical is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, like what, you know, a lot of people ask me,</p>
<p>am I allowed to say this?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m allowed to say this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve eaten shrooms a couple of times,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t gone the full,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to a few researchers in psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting scientifically place.</p>
<p>Like what is the portal you&rsquo;re entering</p>
<p>when you take psychedelics?</p>
<p>Or another way to ask is like dreams.</p>
<p>So let me tell you what I think,</p>
<p>which is based on nothing.</p>
<p>Like this is based on my, right, so I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Your intuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on my, I&rsquo;m guessing now,</p>
<p>based on what I do know, I would say.</p>
<p>But I think that, well, think about what happens.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re running, your brain&rsquo;s running this internal model</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all outside of your awareness.</p>
<p>You see the, you feel the products,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t sense the,</p>
<p>you have no awareness of the mechanics of it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going on all the time.</p>
<p>And so one thing that&rsquo;s going on all the time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re completely unaware of</p>
<p>is that when your brain,</p>
<p>your brain is basically asking itself,</p>
<p>figuratively speaking, not literally, right?</p>
<p>Like how is, the last time I was in this sensory array</p>
<p>with this stuff going on in my body</p>
<p>and this chain of events which just occurred,</p>
<p>what did I do next?</p>
<p>What did I feel next?</p>
<p>What did I see next?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t come up with one answer.</p>
<p>It comes up with a distribution of it, possible answers.</p>
<p>And then there has to be some selection process.</p>
<p>And so you have a network in your brain,</p>
<p>a sub network in your brain, a population of neurons</p>
<p>that helps to choose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m not talking about a homunculus in your brain</p>
<p>or anything silly like that.</p>
<p>This is not the soul.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the center of yourself or anything like that.</p>
<p>But there is a set of neurons</p>
<p>that weighs the probabilities</p>
<p>and helps to select or narrow the field, okay?</p>
<p>And that network is working all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually called the control network,</p>
<p>the executive control network,</p>
<p>or you can call it a frontoparietal</p>
<p>because the regions of the brain that make it up</p>
<p>are in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.</p>
<p>There are also parts that belong</p>
<p>to the subcortical parts of your brain.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The point is that there is this network</p>
<p>and it is working all the time.</p>
<p>Whether or not you feel in control,</p>
<p>whether or not you feel like you&rsquo;re expending effort</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on all the time, except when you sleep.</p>
<p>When you sleep, it&rsquo;s a little bit relaxed.</p>
<p>And so think about what&rsquo;s happening when you sleep.</p>
<p>When you sleep, the external world recedes,</p>
<p>the sense data from,</p>
<p>so basically your model becomes a little bit,</p>
<p>the tethers from the world are loosened.</p>
<p>And this network, which is involved in,</p>
<p>you know, maybe weeding out unrealistic things</p>
<p>is a little bit quiet.</p>
<p>So use your dreams are really your internal model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unconstrained by the immediate world.</p>
<p>Except, so you can do things that you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>in real life, in your dreams, right?</p>
<p>You can fly.</p>
<p>Like I, for example, when I fly on my back in a dream,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much faster than when I fly on my front.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me why, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Or when you&rsquo;re laying on your back in your dream.</p>
<p>No, when I&rsquo;m in my dream and flying in a dream,</p>
<p>I am much faster flyer in the air.</p>
<p>You fly often?</p>
<p>Not often, but I, You talk about it like you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve flown for many years.</p>
<p>Well, you must try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve flown, I&rsquo;ve fallen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re talking about like airplane.</p>
<p>Yeah, I fly in my dreams.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m way faster, right? On your back.</p>
<p>On my back, way faster.</p>
<p>Now you can say, well, you know,</p>
<p>you never flew in your life.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s conceptual combination.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve flown in an airplane</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen birds fly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve watched movies of people flying</p>
<p>and I know Superman probably flies,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he flies faster on his back, but.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve never seen Superman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always flying on his front, right, but yeah.</p>
<p>But anyways, my point is that, you know,</p>
<p>all of this stuff really, all of these experiences</p>
<p>really become part of your internal model.</p>
<p>The thing is that when you&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>your internal model is still being constrained</p>
<p>by your body.</p>
<p>Your brain&rsquo;s always attached to your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always receiving sense data from your body.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mostly never aware of it</p>
<p>unless you run up the stairs</p>
<p>or, you know, maybe you are ill in some way.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re mostly not aware of it,</p>
<p>which is a really good thing.</p>
<p>Because if you were, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d never pay attention to anything</p>
<p>outside your own skin ever again.</p>
<p>Like right now, you seem like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting there very calmly,</p>
<p>but you have a virtual drama, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an opera going on inside your body.</p>
<p>And so I think that one of the things</p>
<p>that happens when people take psilocybin</p>
<p>or take, you know, ketamine, for example,</p>
<p>is that the tethers are completely removed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s helpful to have a guide, right?</p>
<p>Because the guide is giving you sense data</p>
<p>to steer that internal model</p>
<p>so that it doesn&rsquo;t go completely off the rails.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, that wiring to the other brain,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guide, is at least a tiny little tether.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about emotion a little bit, if we could.</p>
<p>Emotion comes up often.</p>
<p>And I have never spoken with anybody</p>
<p>who has a clarity about emotion</p>
<p>from a biological and neuroscience perspective that you do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure I fully know how to,</p>
<p>as a, I mentioned this way too much,</p>
<p>but as somebody who was born in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and romanticizes basically everything,</p>
<p>talks about love nonstop,</p>
<p>you know, emotion is a, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to,</p>
<p>so maybe let&rsquo;s just try to talk about it.</p>
<p>I mean, from a neuroscience perspective,</p>
<p>we talked about it a little bit last time,</p>
<p>your book covers it, how emotions are made,</p>
<p>but what are some misconceptions we writers of poetry,</p>
<p>we romanticizing humans have about emotion</p>
<p>that we should move away from before</p>
<p>to think about emotion from both a scientific</p>
<p>and an engineering perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there is a common view of emotion in the West.</p>
<p>The caricature of that view is that,</p>
<p>you know, we have an inner beast, right?</p>
<p>Your limbic system, your inner lizard,</p>
<p>we have an inner beast</p>
<p>and that comes baked in to the brain at birth.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got circuits for anger, sadness, fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that they all have English names,</p>
<p>these circuits.</p>
<p>But, and they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re triggered by things in the world.</p>
<p>And then they cause you to do and say,</p>
<p>and so when your fear circuit is triggered,</p>
<p>you widen your eyes, you gasp,</p>
<p>your heart rate goes up,</p>
<p>you prepare to flee or to freeze.</p>
<p>And these are modal responses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the only responses that you give,</p>
<p>but on average, they&rsquo;re the prototypical responses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the view.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the view of emotion in the law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the view, you know,</p>
<p>that emotions are these profoundly unhelpful things</p>
<p>that are obligatory kind of like reflexes.</p>
<p>The problem with that view</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t comport to the evidence.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The evidence actually lines up beautifully with each other.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t line up with that view.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re measuring people&rsquo;s faces,</p>
<p>facial movements, or you&rsquo;re measuring their body movements,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re measuring their peripheral physiology,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re measuring their brains</p>
<p>or their voices or whatever.</p>
<p>Pick any output that you wanna measure</p>
<p>and any system you wanna measure,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t really find strong evidence for this.</p>
<p>And I say this as somebody who not only has reviewed</p>
<p>really thousands of articles and run big meta analyses,</p>
<p>which are statistical summaries of published papers,</p>
<p>but also as someone who has sent teams of researchers</p>
<p>to small scale cultures,</p>
<p>you know, remote cultures,</p>
<p>which are very different from urban,</p>
<p>large scale cultures like ours.</p>
<p>And one culture that we visited,</p>
<p>and I say we euphemistically because I myself didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>because I only had two research permits,</p>
<p>and I gave them to my students</p>
<p>because I felt like it was better for them</p>
<p>to have that experience</p>
<p>and more formative for them to have that experience.</p>
<p>But I was in contact with them every day by satellite phone.</p>
<p>And this was to visit the Hadza hunter gatherers in Tanzania</p>
<p>who are not an ancient people, they&rsquo;re a modern culture,</p>
<p>but they live in circumstances, hunting and foraging,</p>
<p>circumstances that are very similar,</p>
<p>in similar conditions to our ancestors,</p>
<p>hunting gathering ancestors,</p>
<p>when expressions of emotion were supposed to have evolved,</p>
<p>at least by one view of, okay.</p>
<p>So, you know, for many years,</p>
<p>I was sort of struggling with this set of observations,</p>
<p>which is that I feel emotion,</p>
<p>and I perceive emotion in other people,</p>
<p>but scientists can&rsquo;t find a single marker,</p>
<p>a single biomarker,</p>
<p>not a single individual measure or pattern of measures</p>
<p>that can predict what kind of emotional state they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>How could that possibly be?</p>
<p>How can you possibly make sense of those two things?</p>
<p>And through a lot of reading</p>
<p>and a lot of an immersing myself in different literatures,</p>
<p>I came to the hypothesis that the brain</p>
<p>is constructing these instances</p>
<p>out of more basic ingredients.</p>
<p>So when I tell you that the brain,</p>
<p>when I suggest to you that what your brain is doing</p>
<p>is making a prediction,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s asking itself, figuratively speaking,</p>
<p>the last time I was in this situation</p>
<p>and this, you know, physical state,</p>
<p>what did I do next?</p>
<p>What did I see next?</p>
<p>What did I hear next?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically asking what in my past</p>
<p>is similar to the present?</p>
<p>Things which are similar to one another</p>
<p>are called a category.</p>
<p>A group of things which are similar</p>
<p>to one another is a category.</p>
<p>And a mental representation of a category is a concept.</p>
<p>So your brain is constructing categories or concepts</p>
<p>on the fly continuously.</p>
<p>So you really want to understand what a brain is doing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, using machine learning like classification models</p>
<p>is not going to help you</p>
<p>because the brain doesn&rsquo;t classify.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing category construction.</p>
<p>And the categories change,</p>
<p>or you could say it&rsquo;s doing concept construction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using past experience to conjure a concept,</p>
<p>which is a prediction.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s using past experiences of emotion,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s constructing an emotion concept.</p>
<p>Your concept will be,</p>
<p>the content of it changes</p>
<p>depending on the situation that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So for example, if your brain uses past experiences of anger</p>
<p>that you have learned,</p>
<p>either because somebody labeled them for you,</p>
<p>taught them to you, you observed them in movies and so on,</p>
<p>in one situation could be very different</p>
<p>from your concept of for anger than another situation.</p>
<p>And this is how anger, instances of anger are,</p>
<p>we call a population of variable instances.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&rsquo;re angry, you scowl.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&rsquo;re angry, you might smile.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&rsquo;re angry, you might cry.</p>
<p>Sometimes your heart rate will go up, it will go down,</p>
<p>it will stay the same.</p>
<p>It depends on what action you&rsquo;re about to take</p>
<p>because the way prediction, and I should say,</p>
<p>the idea that physiology is yoked to action</p>
<p>is a very old idea in the study</p>
<p>of the peripheral nervous system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been known for really decades.</p>
<p>And so if you look at what the brain is doing,</p>
<p>if you just look at the anatomy and you,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the hypothesis that you would come up with.</p>
<p>And I can go into the details.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve published these details in scientific papers</p>
<p>and they also appear somewhat in</p>
<p>How Emotions Were Made, my first book.</p>
<p>They are not in the seven and a half lessons</p>
<p>because that book is really not pitched</p>
<p>at that level of explanation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just giving, it&rsquo;s really just a set of little essays.</p>
<p>But the evidence, but what I&rsquo;m about to say</p>
<p>is actually based on scientific evidence.</p>
<p>When your brain begins to form a prediction,</p>
<p>the first thing it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s making a prediction</p>
<p>of how to change the internal systems of your body,</p>
<p>your heart, your cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>the control of your heart, control of your lungs,</p>
<p>a flush of cortisol, which is not a stress hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hormone that gets glucose</p>
<p>into your bloodstream very fast</p>
<p>because your brain is predicting you need to do this.</p>
<p>Predicting you need to do something</p>
<p>metabolically expensive.</p>
<p>And so either that means either move or learn, okay?</p>
<p>And so your brain is preparing your body,</p>
<p>the internal systems of your body</p>
<p>to execute some actions, to move in some way.</p>
<p>And then it infers based on those motor predictions</p>
<p>and what we call viscera motor predictions,</p>
<p>meaning the changes in the viscera</p>
<p>that your brain is preparing to execute,</p>
<p>your brain makes an inference about what you will sense</p>
<p>based on those motor movements.</p>
<p>So your experience of the world</p>
<p>and your experience of your own body</p>
<p>are a consequence of those predictions, those concepts.</p>
<p>When your brain makes a concept for emotion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s constructing an instance of that emotion.</p>
<p>And that is how emotions are made.</p>
<p>And those concepts load in,</p>
<p>the predictions that are made include contents</p>
<p>inside the body, contents outside the body.</p>
<p>I mean, it includes other humans.</p>
<p>So just this construction of a concept</p>
<p>includes the variables that are much richer</p>
<p>than just some sort of simple notion.</p>
<p>Yeah, so our colloquial notion of a concept</p>
<p>where I say, well, what&rsquo;s a concept of a bird?</p>
<p>And then you list a set of features off to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s understanding,</p>
<p>typically of what a concept is.</p>
<p>But if you go into the literature in cognitive science,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is that the way</p>
<p>that scientists have understood what a concept is</p>
<p>has really changed over the years.</p>
<p>So people used to think about a concept</p>
<p>as philosophers and scientists used to think about a concept</p>
<p>as a dictionary definition for a category.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a set of things which are similar</p>
<p>out in the world.</p>
<p>And your concept for that category</p>
<p>is a dictionary definition of the features,</p>
<p>the necessary insufficient features of those instances.</p>
<p>So for a bird, it would be.</p>
<p>Wings, feathers. Right, a beak.</p>
<p>It flies, whatever, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the classical category.</p>
<p>And scientists discovered, observed</p>
<p>that actually not all instances of birds have feathers</p>
<p>and not all instances of birds fly.</p>
<p>And so the idea was that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a single representation of necessary insufficient features</p>
<p>stored in your brain somewhere.</p>
<p>Instead, what you have is a prototype,</p>
<p>a prototype meaning you still have</p>
<p>a single representation for the category, one,</p>
<p>but the features are like of the most typical instance</p>
<p>of the category or maybe the most frequent instance,</p>
<p>but not all instances of the category</p>
<p>have all the features, right?</p>
<p>They have some graded similarity to the prototype.</p>
<p>And then, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna like incredibly simplify now,</p>
<p>a lot of work to say that then a series of experiments</p>
<p>were done to show that in fact,</p>
<p>what your brain seems to be doing is coming up</p>
<p>with a single exemplar or instance of the category</p>
<p>and reading off the features</p>
<p>when I ask you for the concept.</p>
<p>So if we were in a pet store and I asked you</p>
<p>what are the features of a bird,</p>
<p>tell me the concept of bird,</p>
<p>you would be more likely to give me features of a good pet.</p>
<p>And if we were in a restaurant,</p>
<p>you would be more likely, you know, like a budgie, right?</p>
<p>Or a canary.</p>
<p>If we were in a restaurant,</p>
<p>you would be more likely to give me the features</p>
<p>of a bird that you would eat, like a chicken.</p>
<p>And if we were in a park,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be more likely to give me in this country,</p>
<p>you know, the features of a sparrow or a robin.</p>
<p>Whereas if we were in South America,</p>
<p>you would probably give me the features of a peacock</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s more common</p>
<p>or it is more common there than here</p>
<p>that you would see a peacock in such circumstances.</p>
<p>So the idea was that really what your brain was doing</p>
<p>was conjuring a concept on the fly</p>
<p>that meets the function that the category is being put to.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then people started studying ad hoc concepts,</p>
<p>meaning concepts where the instances don&rsquo;t share</p>
<p>any physical features, but the function of the instances</p>
<p>are the same.</p>
<p>So for example, think about all the things</p>
<p>that can protect you from the rain.</p>
<p>What are all the things that can protect you from the rain?</p>
<p>Umbrella, like this apartment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Your car.</p>
<p>Not giving a damn.</p>
<p>Like a mindset.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>So the idea is that the function of the instances</p>
<p>is the same in a given situation.</p>
<p>Even if they look different, sound different,</p>
<p>smell different, this is called an abstract concept</p>
<p>or a conceptual concept.</p>
<p>Now the really cool thing about conceptual categories</p>
<p>or conceptual category is a category of things</p>
<p>that are held together by a function,</p>
<p>which is called an abstract concept</p>
<p>or a conceptual category,</p>
<p>because the things don&rsquo;t share physical features,</p>
<p>they share functional features.</p>
<p>There are two really cool things about this.</p>
<p>One is that&rsquo;s what Darwin said a species was.</p>
<p>So Darwin is known for discovering natural selection.</p>
<p>But the other thing he really did,</p>
<p>which was really profound, which he&rsquo;s less celebrated for,</p>
<p>is understanding that all biological categories</p>
<p>have inherent variation, inherent variation.</p>
<p>Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species</p>
<p>about before Darwin&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>a species was thought to be a classical category</p>
<p>where all the instances of dogs were the same,</p>
<p>had the exactly same features,</p>
<p>and any variation from that perfect platonic instance</p>
<p>was considered to be error.</p>
<p>And Darwin said, no, it&rsquo;s not error, it&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>
<p>So nature selects on the basis of that variation.</p>
<p>The reason why natural selection is powerful and can exist</p>
<p>is because there is variation in a species.</p>
<p>And in dogs, we talk about that variation</p>
<p>in terms of the size of the dog</p>
<p>and the amount of fur the dog has and the color</p>
<p>and how long is the tail and how long is the snout.</p>
<p>In humans, we talk about that variation</p>
<p>in all kinds of ways, right, including in cultural ways.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>about conceptual categories is that Darwin</p>
<p>is basically saying a species is a conceptual category.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you look at modern debates</p>
<p>about what is a species, you can&rsquo;t find anybody</p>
<p>agreeing on what the criteria are for a species,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t all share the same genome.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t all share, we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a single human genome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a population of genomes, but they&rsquo;re variable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unbounded variation, but they are variable, right?</p>
<p>And the other thing that&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>about conceptual categories is that they are the categories</p>
<p>that we use to make civilization.</p>
<p>So think about money, for example.</p>
<p>What are all the physical things</p>
<p>that make something a currency?</p>
<p>Is there any physical feature that all the currencies</p>
<p>in all the worlds that&rsquo;s ever been used by humans share?</p>
<p>Well, certainly, right, but what is it?</p>
<p>Is it definable?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s getting to the point that you make this function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the function, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we trade it for material goods.</p>
<p>And we have to agree, right?</p>
<p>We all impose on whatever it is, salt, barley,</p>
<p>little shells, big rocks in the ocean that can&rsquo;t move,</p>
<p>Bitcoin, pieces of plastic, mortgages,</p>
<p>which are basically a promise of something in the future,</p>
<p>nothing more, right?</p>
<p>All of these things, we impose value on them.</p>
<p>And we all agree that we can exchange them</p>
<p>for material goods.</p>
<p>Yeah, and yes, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re attributing some of that to Darwin,</p>
<p>that he thought.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m saying that what Darwin.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a brilliant view</p>
<p>of what a species is, is the function.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I&rsquo;m saying is that what Darwin,</p>
<p>Darwin really talked about variation in,</p>
<p>so if you read, for example,</p>
<p>the biologist Ernst Mayr,</p>
<p>who was an evolutionary biologist,</p>
<p>and then when he retired,</p>
<p>became a historian and philosopher of biology.</p>
<p>And his suggestion is that Darwin,</p>
<p>Darwin did talk about variation.</p>
<p>He vanquished what&rsquo;s called essentialism,</p>
<p>the idea that there&rsquo;s a single set of features</p>
<p>that define any species.</p>
<p>And out of that grew really discussions</p>
<p>of some of the functional features that species have,</p>
<p>like they can reproduce, they can have offspring,</p>
<p>the individuals of a species can have offspring.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s not a perfect criterion to use,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a functional criterion, right?</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that in cognitive science,</p>
<p>people came up with the idea,</p>
<p>they discovered the idea of conceptual categories</p>
<p>or ad hoc concepts, these concepts that can change</p>
<p>based on the function they&rsquo;re serving, right?</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s in Darwin,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also in the philosophy of social reality.</p>
<p>The way that philosophers talk about social reality,</p>
<p>just look around you.</p>
<p>I mean, we impose,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re treating a bunch of things as similar,</p>
<p>which are physically different.</p>
<p>And sometimes we take things that are physically the same</p>
<p>and we treat them as separate categories.</p>
<p>But it feels like the number of variables involved</p>
<p>in that kind of categorization is nearly infinite.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so,</p>
<p>because there is a physical constraint, right?</p>
<p>Like you and I could agree that we can fly in real life,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a physical constraint that we can&rsquo;t break, right?</p>
<p>You and I could agree that we could walk through the walls,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We could agree that we could eat glass,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot of constraints, but I just.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could agree that the virus doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have to wear masks.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>But physical reality still holds the Trump card, right?</p>
<p>But still there&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>The Trump card, well, pun unintended.</p>
<p>Pun completely unintended, but there you go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a predicting brain for you.</p>
<p>But there is a tremendous amount of leeway.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that emotions are like money.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re like money, they&rsquo;re like countries,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like kings and queens and presidents.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like everything that we construct</p>
<p>that we impose meaning on.</p>
<p>We take these physical signals and we give them meanings</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t otherwise have by their physical nature.</p>
<p>And because we agree, they have that function.</p>
<p>But the beautiful thing, so maybe unlike money,</p>
<p>I love this similarity is it&rsquo;s not obvious to me</p>
<p>that this kind of emergent agreement</p>
<p>should happen with emotion,</p>
<p>because our experiences are so different</p>
<p>for each of us humans, and yet we kind of converge.</p>
<p>Well, in a culture we converge, but not across cultures.</p>
<p>There are huge, huge differences.</p>
<p>There are huge differences in what concepts exist,</p>
<p>what they look like.</p>
<p>So what I would say is that what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with our young children as their brains become wired</p>
<p>to their physical and their social environment</p>
<p>is that we are curating for them.</p>
<p>We are bootstrapping into their brains</p>
<p>a set of emotion concepts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partly what they&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>And we curate those for infants</p>
<p>just the way we curate for them what is a dog,</p>
<p>what is a cat, what is a truck.</p>
<p>We sometimes explicitly label</p>
<p>and we sometimes just use mental words.</p>
<p>When your kid is throwing Cheerios on the floor</p>
<p>instead of eating them, or your kid is crying</p>
<p>when she won&rsquo;t put herself to sleep or whatever.</p>
<p>We use mental words.</p>
<p>And a word is this, words for infants,</p>
<p>words are these really special things</p>
<p>that they help infants learn abstract categories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge literature showing that children can take</p>
<p>things that don&rsquo;t look infants,</p>
<p>like infants, really young infants,</p>
<p>preverbal infants can take, if you label,</p>
<p>if I say to you, and you&rsquo;re an infant, okay?</p>
<p>So I say, Lexi, this is a bling.</p>
<p>And I put it down and the bling makes a squeaky noise.</p>
<p>And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.</p>
<p>And I put it down and it makes a squeaky noise.</p>
<p>And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.</p>
<p>You, as young as four months old,</p>
<p>will expect this to make a noise, a squeaky noise.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, if it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll be surprised</p>
<p>because it violated your expectation, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building for you an internal model of a bling.</p>
<p>Okay, infants can do this really, really at a young age.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no reason to believe</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t learn emotion categories</p>
<p>and concepts in the same way.</p>
<p>And what happens when you go to a new culture?</p>
<p>When you go to a new culture,</p>
<p>you have to do what&rsquo;s called emotion acculturation.</p>
<p>So my colleague Bacha Mesquita in Belgium</p>
<p>studies emotion acculturation.</p>
<p>She studies how, when people move</p>
<p>from one culture to another,</p>
<p>how do they learn the emotion concepts of that culture?</p>
<p>How do they learn to make sense</p>
<p>of their own internal sensations</p>
<p>and also the movements, the raise of an eyebrow,</p>
<p>the tilt of a head?</p>
<p>How do they learn to make sense of cues from other people</p>
<p>using concepts they don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>but have to make on the fly?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the difference between cultures.</p>
<p>Let me open another door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I wanna open,</p>
<p>but the difference between men and women.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between the emotional lives</p>
<p>of those two categories of biological systems?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>We did a series of studies in the 1990s</p>
<p>where we asked men and women</p>
<p>to tell us about their emotional lives.</p>
<p>And women described themselves</p>
<p>as much more emotional than men.</p>
<p>They believed that they were more emotional than men</p>
<p>and men agreed.</p>
<p>Women are much more emotional than men.</p>
<p>And then we gave them little handheld computers.</p>
<p>These were little Hewlett Packard computers.</p>
<p>They fit in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>They weighed a couple of pounds.</p>
<p>So this was like pre palm pilot even,</p>
<p>like this was 1990s and like early.</p>
<p>And we asked them,</p>
<p>we would ping them like 10 times a day</p>
<p>and just ask them to report how they were feeling,</p>
<p>which is called experience sampling.</p>
<p>So we experienced sampled.</p>
<p>And then at the end,</p>
<p>and then we looked at their reports</p>
<p>and what we found is that men and women</p>
<p>basically didn&rsquo;t differ.</p>
<p>And there were some people who were really,</p>
<p>had many more instances of emotion.</p>
<p>So they were treading water in a tumultuous sea of emotion.</p>
<p>And then there were other people</p>
<p>who were like floating tranquilly in a lake.</p>
<p>It was really not perturbed very often.</p>
<p>And everyone in between,</p>
<p>but there were no difference between men and women.</p>
<p>And the really interesting thing is at the end</p>
<p>of the sampling period, we asked people,</p>
<p>so reflect over the past two weeks and tell it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been now pinging people like again</p>
<p>and again and again, right?</p>
<p>So tell us how emotional do you think you are?</p>
<p>No change from the beginning.</p>
<p>So men and women believe that they are different.</p>
<p>And when they are looking at other people,</p>
<p>they make different inferences about emotion.</p>
<p>If a man is scowling,</p>
<p>like if you and I were together</p>
<p>and so somebody is watching this, okay?</p>
<p>And yeah, hey, who are you saying?</p>
<p>Hey, hi.</p>
<p>Yeah, hi.</p>
<p>By the way, people love it when you look at the camera.</p>
<p>If you and I make exactly the same set of facial movements,</p>
<p>when people look at you, both men and women look at you,</p>
<p>they are more likely to think,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s reacting to the situation.</p>
<p>And when they look at me, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>oh, she&rsquo;s having an emotion.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>And I wrote about this actually</p>
<p>right before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>You know what, maybe I could confess.</p>
<p>Let me try to carefully confess.</p>
<p>But you are really gonna.</p>
<p>Yeah, that when I,</p>
<p>that there is an element when I see Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>that there was something annoying about her to me.</p>
<p>And I, just that feeling,</p>
<p>and then I tried to reduce that to what is that?</p>
<p>Because I think the same attributes</p>
<p>that are annoying about her</p>
<p>when I see in other people wouldn&rsquo;t be annoying.</p>
<p>So I was trying to understand what is it?</p>
<p>Because it certainly does feel like that concept</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve constructed in my mind.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you that I think,</p>
<p>well, let me just say that what you would predict about,</p>
<p>for example, the performance of the two of them</p>
<p>in the debates, and I wrote an op ed</p>
<p>for the New York Times actually before the second debate.</p>
<p>And it played out really pretty much</p>
<p>as I thought that it would based on research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m like a great fortune teller or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I was just applying the research,</p>
<p>which was that when a woman,</p>
<p>a woman&rsquo;s, people make internal attributions, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>They infer that the facial movements and body posture</p>
<p>and vocalizations of a woman reflect her interstate.</p>
<p>But for a man, they&rsquo;re more likely to assume</p>
<p>that they reflect his response to the situation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say anything about him.</p>
<p>It says something about the situation he&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>Now, for the thing that you were describing</p>
<p>about Hillary Clinton, I think a lot of people experienced,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also in line with research, which shows,</p>
<p>and particularly research actually</p>
<p>about teaching evaluations is one place</p>
<p>that you really see it, where the expectation</p>
<p>is that a woman will be nurturant</p>
<p>and that a man, there&rsquo;s just no expectation</p>
<p>for him to be nurturant.</p>
<p>So if he is nurturant, he gets points.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s not, he gets points.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just different points, right?</p>
<p>Whereas for a woman, especially a woman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an authority figure, she&rsquo;s really in a catch 22.</p>
<p>Because if she&rsquo;s serious, she&rsquo;s a bitch.</p>
<p>And if she&rsquo;s empathic, then she&rsquo;s weak.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s brilliant. I mean, one of the bigger questions</p>
<p>to ask here, so that&rsquo;s one example</p>
<p>where our construction of concepts gets in trouble.</p>
<p>So, but remember I said science and philosophy</p>
<p>are like tools for living.</p>
<p>So I learned recently that if you ask me</p>
<p>what is my intuition about what regulates my eating,</p>
<p>I will say carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I love carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I love pasta.</p>
<p>I love bread.</p>
<p>I love, I just love carbohydrates.</p>
<p>But actually research shows, and it&rsquo;s beautiful research.</p>
<p>I love this research because it so violates my own</p>
<p>like deeply, deeply held beliefs about myself</p>
<p>that most animals on this planet who have been studied</p>
<p>and there are many actually eat</p>
<p>to regulate their protein intake.</p>
<p>So you will overeat carbohydrates</p>
<p>if you, in order to get enough protein.</p>
<p>And this research has been done with human,</p>
<p>very beautiful research with humans, with crickets,</p>
<p>with like, you know, bonobos.</p>
<p>I mean, just like all these different animals, not bonobos,</p>
<p>but I think like baboons.</p>
<p>Now that I have no intuition about that.</p>
<p>And I, even now as I regulate my eating,</p>
<p>I still, I just have no intuition.</p>
<p>It just, I can&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>What I feel is only about the carbohydrates.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re regulating around carbohydrates,</p>
<p>not the protein.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in fact, actually what I am doing,</p>
<p>if I am like most animals on the planet,</p>
<p>I am regulating around protein.</p>
<p>So knowing this, what do I do?</p>
<p>I correct my behavior to eat,</p>
<p>to actually deliberately try to focus on the protein.</p>
<p>This is the idea behind bias training, right?</p>
<p>Like if you,</p>
<p>I also did not experience Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>as the warmest candidate.</p>
<p>However, you can use consistent science,</p>
<p>since the consistent scientific findings</p>
<p>to organize your behavior.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that rationality</p>
<p>is the absence of emotion,</p>
<p>because sometimes emotion or any feelings in general,</p>
<p>not the same thing as emotion, that&rsquo;s another topic,</p>
<p>but are a source of information</p>
<p>and their wisdom and helpful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that,</p>
<p>but what I am saying is that</p>
<p>if you have a deeply held belief</p>
<p>and the evidence shows that you&rsquo;re wrong, then you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how confident you feel.</p>
<p>That confidence could be also explained by science, right?</p>
<p>So it would be the same thing as if I,</p>
<p>regardless of whether someone is like Charlie Baker,</p>
<p>regardless of whether somebody is a Republican</p>
<p>or a Democrat,</p>
<p>if that person has a record that you can see</p>
<p>is consistent with what you believe,</p>
<p>then that is information that you can act on.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then try to,</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of what empathy is in open mindedness,</p>
<p>is try to consider that the set of concepts</p>
<p>that your brain has constructed</p>
<p>through which you are now perceiving the world</p>
<p>is not painting the full picture.</p>
<p>I mean, this is now true for basically every,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be men and women,</p>
<p>it could be basically the prism through which we perceive</p>
<p>actually the political discourse, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, so here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>There are people who, scientists who will talk to you</p>
<p>about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy</p>
<p>and I prefer to think of it,</p>
<p>I think the evidence is more consistent</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>which is that your brain is always making predictions</p>
<p>using your own past experience and what you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from books and movies and other people telling you</p>
<p>about their experiences and so on.</p>
<p>And if your brain cannot make a concept</p>
<p>to make sense of those, anticipate what those sense data are</p>
<p>and make sense of them, you will be experientially blind.</p>
<p>So, when I&rsquo;m giving lectures to people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show them like a blobby black and white image</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re experientially blind to the image,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t see anything in it.</p>
<p>And then I show them a photograph</p>
<p>and then I show them the image again, the blobby image</p>
<p>and then they see actually an object in it.</p>
<p>But the image is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re actually adding,</p>
<p>their predictions now are adding, right?</p>
<p>Or anybody who&rsquo;s learned a language,</p>
<p>a second language after their first language</p>
<p>also has this experience of things</p>
<p>that initially sound like sounds</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t quite make sense of,</p>
<p>eventually come to make sense of them.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are really cool examples</p>
<p>of people who were like born blind</p>
<p>because they have cataracts or they have corneal damage</p>
<p>so that no light is reaching the brain.</p>
<p>And then they have an operation</p>
<p>and then light reaches the brain and they can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>For days and weeks and sometimes years,</p>
<p>they are experientially blind to certain things.</p>
<p>So what happens with empathy, right?</p>
<p>Is that your brain is making a prediction.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to make,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t share, if you&rsquo;re not similar,</p>
<p>remember categories are instances</p>
<p>which are similar in some way.</p>
<p>If you are not similar enough to that person,</p>
<p>you will have a hard time making a prediction</p>
<p>about what they feel.</p>
<p>You will be experientially blind to what they feel.</p>
<p>In the United States, children of color</p>
<p>are under prescribed medicine by their physicians.</p>
<p>This is been documented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the physicians are racist necessarily</p>
<p>but they might be experientially blind.</p>
<p>The same thing is true of male physicians</p>
<p>with female patients.</p>
<p>I could tell you some hair raising stories really</p>
<p>that where people die as a consequence</p>
<p>of a physician making the wrong inference,</p>
<p>the wrong prediction because of being experientially blind.</p>
<p>So we are, empathy is not, it&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>We make inferences about each other,</p>
<p>about what each other&rsquo;s feeling and thinking.</p>
<p>In this culture more than,</p>
<p>there are some cultures where people</p>
<p>have what&rsquo;s called opacity of mind</p>
<p>where they will make a prediction</p>
<p>about someone else&rsquo;s actions</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not inferring anything</p>
<p>about the internal state of that person.</p>
<p>But in our culture, we&rsquo;re constantly making inferences.</p>
<p>What is this person thinking?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not doing it necessarily consciously</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just doing it really automatically</p>
<p>using our predictions, what we know.</p>
<p>And if you expose yourself to information</p>
<p>which is very different from somebody else,</p>
<p>I mean, really what we have is we have different cultures</p>
<p>in this country right now that are,</p>
<p>there are a number of reasons for this.</p>
<p>I mean, part of it is, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw</p>
<p>the Social Dilemma, the Netflix.</p>
<p>Heard about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great, it&rsquo;s really great documentary and&hellip;</p>
<p>About what social networks are doing to our society?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But nothing, no phenomenon has a simple single cause.</p>
<p>There are multiple small causes</p>
<p>which all add up to a perfect storm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how most things work.</p>
<p>And so the fact that machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>are serving people up information on social media</p>
<p>that is consistent with what they&rsquo;ve already viewed</p>
<p>and making, is part of the reason that you have these silos</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the only reason why you have these silos.</p>
<p>I think there are other things afoot</p>
<p>that enhance people&rsquo;s inability</p>
<p>to even have a decent conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, okay, so many things you said</p>
<p>are just brilliant, so the experiential blindness</p>
<p>but also from my perspective, like I preach</p>
<p>and I try to practice empathy a lot</p>
<p>and something about the way you&rsquo;ve explained it</p>
<p>makes me almost see it as a kind of exercise</p>
<p>that we should all do, like to train,</p>
<p>like to add experiences to the brain</p>
<p>to expand this capacity to predict more effectively.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So like what I do is kind of like a method acting thing</p>
<p>which is I imagine what the life of a person is like.</p>
<p>Just think, I mean, this is something you see</p>
<p>with Black Lives Matter and police officers.</p>
<p>It feels like they&rsquo;re both, not both,</p>
<p>but I have, because martial arts and so on,</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends who are cops.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have empathy or visualize the experience of the other.</p>
<p>Certainly, currently, unfortunately,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t doing that with police officers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not imagining, they&rsquo;re not empathizing</p>
<p>or putting themselves in the shoes of a police officer</p>
<p>to realize how difficult that job is,</p>
<p>how dangerous it is, how difficult it is to maintain calm</p>
<p>and under so much uncertainty, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s even, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but I think that there&rsquo;s even more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even more to be said there.</p>
<p>I mean, like from a predicting brain standpoint,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even more that can be said there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna go down that path</p>
<p>or you wanna stick on empathy,</p>
<p>but I will also say that one of the things</p>
<p>that I was most gratified by, I still am receiving,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been more than three and a half years</p>
<p>since How Motions Are Made came out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still receiving daily emails from people, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gratifying.</p>
<p>But one of the most gratifying emails I received</p>
<p>was from a police officer in Texas</p>
<p>who told me that he thought that How Motions Are Made</p>
<p>contained information that would be really helpful</p>
<p>to resolving some of these difficulties.</p>
<p>And he hadn&rsquo;t even read my op ed piece</p>
<p>about when is a gun not a gun?</p>
<p>And like using what we know about the science of perception</p>
<p>from a prediction standpoint,</p>
<p>like the brain is a predictor,</p>
<p>to understand a little differently</p>
<p>what might be happening in these circumstances.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real, what&rsquo;s hard about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to talk about because everyone gets mad at you</p>
<p>when you talk about this, like, you know.</p>
<p>And there is a way to understand this</p>
<p>which has profound empathy</p>
<p>for the suffering of people of color</p>
<p>and that definitely is in line with Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>at the same time as understanding</p>
<p>the really difficult situation</p>
<p>that police officers find themselves in.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about this bad apple or that bad apple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about police officers</p>
<p>who are necessarily shooting people in the back</p>
<p>as they run away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the cases of really good,</p>
<p>well meaning cops who have the kind of predicting brain</p>
<p>that everybody else has.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a really difficult situation</p>
<p>that I think both they and the people</p>
<p>who are harmed don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>like the way that these situations are constructed,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a lot to be said there I guess</p>
<p>is what I want to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, is there something we can try to say in a sense,</p>
<p>like what I&rsquo;m, from the perspective of the predictive brain</p>
<p>which is a fascinating perspective to take on this,</p>
<p>you know, all the protests that are going on,</p>
<p>there seems to be a concept of a police officer being built.</p>
<p>No, I think that concept is there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gaining strength, so it&rsquo;s being re, I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Sure, it is there.</p>
<p>But I think, yeah, for sure, I think that that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a shift in the stereotype</p>
<p>of what I would say is a stereotype.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a stereotype of a black man in this country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always in movies and television,</p>
<p>not always, but like largely, that many people watch.</p>
<p>I mean, you think you&rsquo;re watching a 10 o clock drama</p>
<p>and all you&rsquo;re doing is like kicking back and relaxing,</p>
<p>but actually you&rsquo;re having certain predictions reinforced</p>
<p>and others not.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happening now with police is the same thing,</p>
<p>that there are certain stereotypes of a police officer</p>
<p>that are being abandoned and other stereotypes</p>
<p>that are being reinforced by what you see happening.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;ll say is that if you remember,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot to say about this, really,</p>
<p>that regardless of whether it makes people mad or not,</p>
<p>I mean, I just, the science is what it is.</p>
<p>Just remember what I said.</p>
<p>The brain makes predictions about internal changes</p>
<p>in the body first and then it starts to prepare motor action</p>
<p>and then it makes a prediction about what you will see</p>
<p>and hear and feel based on those actions, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also the case that we didn&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>is that sensory sampling,</p>
<p>like your brain&rsquo;s ability to sample what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>is yoked to your heart rate, it&rsquo;s yoked to your heartbeats.</p>
<p>There are certain phases of the heartbeat</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s easier for you to see what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the world than in others.</p>
<p>And so if your heart rate goes through the roof,</p>
<p>you will be less likely, you will be more likely</p>
<p>to just go with your prediction and not correct</p>
<p>based on what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually literally not seeing as well.</p>
<p>Or you will see things that aren&rsquo;t there, basically.</p>
<p>Is there something that we could say by way of advice</p>
<p>for when this episode is released</p>
<p>in the chaos of emotion?</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know about a term</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just flying around on social media.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Well, I actually think it is emotion in the following sense.</p>
<p>And it sounds a little bit like,</p>
<p>it sounds a little bit like artificial</p>
<p>in the way that I&rsquo;m about to say it,</p>
<p>but I really think that this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>One thing we haven&rsquo;t talked about is brains evolved,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t evolve for you to see,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t evolve for you to hear,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t evolve for you to feel,</p>
<p>they evolved to control your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have a brain.</p>
<p>You have a brain so that it can control your body.</p>
<p>And the metaphor,</p>
<p>the scientific term for predictively controlling your body</p>
<p>is allostasis.</p>
<p>Your brain is attempting to anticipate the needs</p>
<p>of your body and meet those needs before they arise</p>
<p>so that you can act as you need to act.</p>
<p>And the metaphor that I use is a body budget.</p>
<p>You know, your brain is running a budget for your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not budgeting money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s budgeting glucose and salt and water.</p>
<p>And instead of having, you know,</p>
<p>one or two bank accounts, it has gazillions.</p>
<p>There are all these systems in your body</p>
<p>that have to be kept in balance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s monitoring very closely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making predictions about like,</p>
<p>when is it good to spend and when is it good to save</p>
<p>and what would be a good investment</p>
<p>and am I gonna get a return on my investment?</p>
<p>Whenever people talk about reward or reward prediction error</p>
<p>or anything to do with reward or punishment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about the body budget.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about your brain&rsquo;s predictions</p>
<p>about whether or not there will be a deposit or withdrawal.</p>
<p>So when your brain is running a deficit</p>
<p>in your body budgets,</p>
<p>you have some kind of metabolic imbalance,</p>
<p>you experience that as discomfort.</p>
<p>You experience that as distress.</p>
<p>When your brain, when things are chaotic,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t predict what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>So I have this absolutely brilliant scientist</p>
<p>working in my lab, his name is Jordan Theriot</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s published this really terrific paper</p>
<p>on a sense of should, like why do we have social rules?</p>
<p>Why do we adhere to social norms?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because if I make myself predictable to you,</p>
<p>then you are predictable to me.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re predictable to me, that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because that is less metabolically expensive for me.</p>
<p>Novelty or unpredictability at the extreme is expensive.</p>
<p>And if it goes on for long enough,</p>
<p>what happens is first of all,</p>
<p>you will feel really jittery and antsy,</p>
<p>which we describe as anxiety.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t necessarily anxiety.</p>
<p>It could be just something is not predictable</p>
<p>and you are experiencing arousal</p>
<p>because the chemicals that help you learn</p>
<p>increase your feeling of arousal basically.</p>
<p>But if it goes on for long enough,</p>
<p>you will become depleted</p>
<p>and you will start to feel really, really,</p>
<p>really distressed.</p>
<p>So what we have is a culture full of people right now</p>
<p>who their body budgets are just decimated</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of uncertainty.</p>
<p>When you talk about it as depression and anxiety,</p>
<p>it makes you think that it&rsquo;s not about your metabolism,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not about your body budgeting,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not about getting enough sleep</p>
<p>or about eating well or about making sure</p>
<p>that you have social connections.</p>
<p>You think that it&rsquo;s something separate from that.</p>
<p>But depression and anxiety are just a way</p>
<p>of being in the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a way of being in the world</p>
<p>when things aren&rsquo;t quite right with your predictions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a deep way of thinking.</p>
<p>Like the brain is maintaining homeostasis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually allostasis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s constantly making predictions</p>
<p>and metabolically speaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very costly to make novel,</p>
<p>like constantly be learning to making adjustments.</p>
<p>And then over time, there&rsquo;s a cost to be paid</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just in a place of chaos</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s constant need for adjusting</p>
<p>and learning and experience novel things.</p>
<p>And so part of the problem here,</p>
<p>there are a couple of things.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s a perfect storm.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single cause.</p>
<p>There are multiple cause,</p>
<p>multiple things that combine together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex system, multiple things.</p>
<p>Part of it is that they&rsquo;re metabolically encumbered</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re distressed.</p>
<p>And in order to try to have empathy</p>
<p>for someone who is very much unlike you,</p>
<p>you have to forage for information.</p>
<p>You have to explore information</p>
<p>that is novel to you and unexpected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>And at a time when people feel,</p>
<p>what do you do when you are running a deficit</p>
<p>in your bank account?</p>
<p>You stop spending.</p>
<p>What does it mean for a brain to stop spending?</p>
<p>A brain stops moving very much,</p>
<p>stops moving the body and it stops learning.</p>
<p>It just goes with its internal model.</p>
<p>Brilliantly put, yeah.</p>
<p>So empathy requires,</p>
<p>to have empathy for someone who is unlike you</p>
<p>requires learning and practice, foraging for information.</p>
<p>I mean, it is something I talk about in the book</p>
<p>in seven and a half lessons about the brain.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard for people to have,</p>
<p>to be curious about views that are unlike their own</p>
<p>when they feel so encumbered.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just tell you, I had this epiphany really.</p>
<p>I was listening to Robert Reich&rsquo;s The System.</p>
<p>He was talking about oligarchy versus democracy.</p>
<p>And so oligarchy is where very wealthy people,</p>
<p>like extremely wealthy people,</p>
<p>shift power so that they become even more wealthy</p>
<p>and even more insulated</p>
<p>and from the pressures of the common person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the kind of system</p>
<p>that leads to the collapse of civilizations</p>
<p>if you believe Jared Diamond.</p>
<p>Just say that.</p>
<p>But anyways, I&rsquo;m listening to this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m listening to him describe in fairly decent detail</p>
<p>how the CEOs of these companies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a shift in what it means to be a CEO</p>
<p>and no longer being a steward of the community and so on,</p>
<p>but like in the 1980s, it sort of shifted</p>
<p>to this other model of being like an oligarch.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s talking about how it used to be the case</p>
<p>that CEOs made like 20 times what their employees made</p>
<p>and now they make about 300 times on average</p>
<p>what their employees made.</p>
<p>So where did that money come from?</p>
<p>It came from the pockets of the employees.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t know about it, right?</p>
<p>No one knows about it.</p>
<p>They just know they can&rsquo;t feed their children,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t pay for healthcare,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t take care of their family</p>
<p>and they worry about what&rsquo;s gonna happen to their,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living like months a month basically.</p>
<p>Any one big bill could completely</p>
<p>put them out on the street.</p>
<p>So there are a huge number of people living like this.</p>
<p>So all they, what they&rsquo;re experiencing,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re experiencing it.</p>
<p>And then someone comes along and gives them a narrative.</p>
<p>Well, somebody else butted in line in front of you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re this way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you experience what you&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>And just for a minute, I was thinking,</p>
<p>I had deep empathy for people who have beliefs</p>
<p>that are really, really, really different from mine.</p>
<p>But I was trying really hard to see it through their eyes.</p>
<p>And did it cost me something metabolically?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>But you had something in the gas tank.</p>
<p>Well, I. In order to allocate that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the question is like,</p>
<p>where did you, what resources did your brain draw on</p>
<p>in order to actually make that effort?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you something, honestly, Lex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that much in the gas tank right now.</p>
<p>Right, so I am surfing the stress that,</p>
<p>stress is just, what is stress?</p>
<p>Stress is your brain is preparing for a big metabolic outlay</p>
<p>and it just keeps preparing and preparing</p>
<p>and preparing and preparing.</p>
<p>You as a professor, you as a human.</p>
<p>Both, right?</p>
<p>For me, this is a moment of existential crisis</p>
<p>as much as anybody else, democracy, all of these things.</p>
<p>So in many of my roles, so I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say</p>
<p>is that I get up every morning and I exercise.</p>
<p>I run, I row, I lift weights, right?</p>
<p>You exercise in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>I saw your like, you know, daily thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hate it actually.</p>
<p>You love it, right?</p>
<p>You get a&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I hate it.</p>
<p>I hate it, but I do it religiously.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a really good investment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an expenditure that is a really good investment.</p>
<p>And so when I was exercising, I was listening to the book</p>
<p>and when I realized the insights that I was sort of like</p>
<p>playing around with, like, is this, does this make sense?</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t immediately plunge into it.</p>
<p>I basically wrote some stuff down, I set it aside</p>
<p>and then I did what I prepared myself to make an expenditure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you do before you exercise.</p>
<p>I always have a protein shake, always have a protein shake</p>
<p>because I need to fuel up</p>
<p>before I make this really big expenditure.</p>
<p>And so I did the same thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a protein drink, but I did the same thing.</p>
<p>And fueling up can mean lots of different things.</p>
<p>It can mean talking to a friend about it.</p>
<p>It can mean, you know, it can mean making sure</p>
<p>you get a good night&rsquo;s sleep before you do it.</p>
<p>It can mean lots of different things,</p>
<p>but I guess I think we have to do these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna re listen to this conversation</p>
<p>several times, this is brilliant.</p>
<p>But I do think about, you know, I&rsquo;ve encountered</p>
<p>so many people that can&rsquo;t possibly imagine</p>
<p>that a good human being can vote for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also encountered people that can&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>that an intelligent person can possibly vote for Democrat.</p>
<p>And I look at both these people,</p>
<p>many of whom are friends, and let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>after this conversation, I can see as they&rsquo;re predicting</p>
<p>brains not willing to invest the resources</p>
<p>to empathize with the other side.</p>
<p>And I think you have to in order to be able to,</p>
<p>like, to see the obvious common humanity in us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the system is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating this division.</p>
<p>We can put it, like you said, it&rsquo;s a perfect storm.</p>
<p>It might be the social media,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bunch of things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s an economic system,</p>
<p>which is disadvantaging large numbers of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a use of social media.</p>
<p>Like if you, you know, if I had to orchestrate</p>
<p>or architect a system that would screw up</p>
<p>a human body budget, it would be the one that we live in.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t sleep enough.</p>
<p>We eat pseudo food, basically.</p>
<p>We are on social media too much,</p>
<p>which is full of ambiguity,</p>
<p>which is really hard for a human nervous system, right?</p>
<p>Really, really hard.</p>
<p>Like ambiguity with no context to predict in.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, really?</p>
<p>And then, you know, there are the economic concerns</p>
<p>that affect large swaths of people in this country.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;m not saying everything</p>
<p>is reducible to metabolism.</p>
<p>Not everything is reducible to metabolism,</p>
<p>but there, if you combine all these things together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to think of it that way.</p>
<p>Then somehow it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>somehow it reduces the entirety of the human experience,</p>
<p>the same kind of obvious logic.</p>
<p>Like we should exercise every day in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>We should empathize every day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, there are these really wonderful,</p>
<p>wonderful programs for teens</p>
<p>and sometimes also for parents of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lost children in wars and in conflicts,</p>
<p>in political conflicts,</p>
<p>where they go to a bucolic setting</p>
<p>and they talk to each other about their experiences.</p>
<p>And miraculous things happen, you know?</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s easy to sort of shrug this stuff off</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to sort of shrug this stuff off</p>
<p>as kind of Pollyanna ish.</p>
<p>You know, like, what&rsquo;s this really gonna do?</p>
<p>But you have to think about,</p>
<p>when my daughter went to college, I gave her advice.</p>
<p>I said, try to be around people</p>
<p>who let you be the kind of person you wanna be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back to free will.</p>
<p>You have a choice, you have a choice.</p>
<p>It might seem like a really hard choice.</p>
<p>It might seem like an unimaginably difficult choice.</p>
<p>You have a choice.</p>
<p>Do you wanna be somebody who is wrapped in fury and agony?</p>
<p>Or do you wanna be somebody who extends a little empathy</p>
<p>to somebody else?</p>
<p>And in the process, maybe learn something.</p>
<p>Curiosity is the thing that protects you.</p>
<p>Curiosity is the thing, it&rsquo;s curative curiosity.</p>
<p>On social media, the thing I recommend to people,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve been approaching social media.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the common approach,</p>
<p>but I basically give love to people</p>
<p>who seem to also give love to others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same similar concept of surrounding yourself</p>
<p>by the people you wanna become.</p>
<p>And I ignore, sometimes block, but just ignore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t add aggression to people</p>
<p>who are just constantly full of aggression</p>
<p>and negativity and toxicity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain desire when somebody says something mean</p>
<p>to say something, to say why,</p>
<p>or try to alleviate the meanness and so on.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re doing essentially</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re now surrounding yourself</p>
<p>by that group of folks that have that negativity.</p>
<p>So even just the conversation.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just so powerful</p>
<p>to put yourself amongst people</p>
<p>whose basic mode of interaction is kindness.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m built,</p>
<p>is that to me is energizing for the gas tank</p>
<p>that then I can pull to when I start reading</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</p>
<p>and start thinking about Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>I can empathize with everybody involved.</p>
<p>I can start to make these difficult thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to understand our little planet Earth.</p>
<p>Well, there is research to back up what you said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s research that&rsquo;s consistent</p>
<p>with your intuition there,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s research that shows</p>
<p>that being kind to other people,</p>
<p>doing something nice for someone else</p>
<p>is like making a deposit to some extent.</p>
<p>Because I think making a deposit</p>
<p>not only in their body budgets,</p>
<p>but also in yours.</p>
<p>Like people feel good when they do good things</p>
<p>for other people.</p>
<p>We are social animals.</p>
<p>We regulate each other&rsquo;s nervous systems</p>
<p>for better and for worse, right?</p>
<p>The best thing for a human nervous system is another human.</p>
<p>And the worst thing for a human nervous system</p>
<p>is another human.</p>
<p>So you decide, do you wanna be somebody</p>
<p>who makes people feel better</p>
<p>or do you wanna be somebody who causes people pain?</p>
<p>And we are more responsible for one another</p>
<p>than we might like or than we might want.</p>
<p>But remember what we said about social reality.</p>
<p>Social reality, there are lots of different cultural norms</p>
<p>about independence or collective nature of people.</p>
<p>But the fact is we have socially dependent nervous systems.</p>
<p>We evolved that way as a species.</p>
<p>And in this country,</p>
<p>we prize individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>And that is a dilemma that we have to grapple with.</p>
<p>And we have to do it in a way</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna be productive about it.</p>
<p>We have to do it in a way</p>
<p>that requires engaging with each other,</p>
<p>and which is what I understand</p>
<p>the founding members of this country intended.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Let me ask a few final silly questions.</p>
<p>So one, talked a bit about love,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fun to ask somebody like you</p>
<p>who can effectively, from at least neuroscience perspective,</p>
<p>disassemble some of these romantic notions.</p>
<p>But what do you make of romantic love?</p>
<p>Why do human beings seem to fall in love?</p>
<p>At least a bunch of 80s hair bands have written about it.</p>
<p>Is that a nice feature to have?</p>
<p>Is that a bug?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m really happy that I fell in love.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>
<p>But I would say.</p>
<p>Is that you the person speaking or the neuroscientist?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s me the person speaking.</p>
<p>But I would say as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>babies are born not able to regulate their own body budgets</p>
<p>because their brains aren&rsquo;t fully wired yet.</p>
<p>When you feed a baby, when you cuddle a baby,</p>
<p>everything you do with a baby</p>
<p>impacts that baby&rsquo;s body budget</p>
<p>and helps to wire that baby&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>to manage eventually her own body budget to some extent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basis biologically of attachment.</p>
<p>Humans evolved as a species to be socially dependent,</p>
<p>meaning you cannot manage your body budget</p>
<p>on your own without a tax</p>
<p>that eventually you pay many years later</p>
<p>in terms of some metabolic illness.</p>
<p>Loneliness, when you break up with someone that you love</p>
<p>or you lose them, you feel like it&rsquo;s gonna kill you,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But loneliness will kill you.</p>
<p>It will kill you approximately,</p>
<p>what is it, seven years earlier?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly the exact number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually in the web notes to seven and a half lessons.</p>
<p>But social isolation and loneliness will kill you earlier</p>
<p>than you would otherwise die.</p>
<p>And the reason why is that you didn&rsquo;t evolve</p>
<p>to manage your nervous system on your own.</p>
<p>And when you do, you pay a little tax</p>
<p>and that tax accrues very slightly over time,</p>
<p>over a long period of time</p>
<p>so that by the time you&rsquo;re in middle age or a little older,</p>
<p>you are more likely to die sooner</p>
<p>from some metabolic illness,</p>
<p>from heart disease, from diabetes, from depression.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>I mean, it takes a long time for that tax to accrue,</p>
<p>but it does.</p>
<p>So yes, I think it&rsquo;s a good thing for people to fall in love.</p>
<p>But I think the funny view of it is that it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>that humans need the social attachment</p>
<p>to, what is it, manage their nervous system</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>And the reason you wanna stay with somebody for a long time</p>
<p>is so you don&rsquo;t have, is the novelty is very costly for.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;re mixing thing.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re, you know, you have to decide whether.</p>
<p>But what I would say is when you lose someone you love,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;ve lost a part of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost someone who was contributing</p>
<p>to your body budget.</p>
<p>We are the caretakers of one another&rsquo;s nervous systems,</p>
<p>like it or not.</p>
<p>And out of that comes very deep feelings of attachment,</p>
<p>some of which are romantic love.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your own mortality?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re two humans sitting here.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>I mean, somebody thinks about your brain a lot.</p>
<p>It seems one of the more terrifying or, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to feel about it,</p>
<p>but it seems to be one of the most definitive aspects</p>
<p>of life is that it ends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated answer, but I think the best I can do</p>
<p>in a short snippet would be to say,</p>
<p>for a very long time, I did not fear my own mortality.</p>
<p>I feared pain and suffering.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I feared.</p>
<p>I feared being harmed or dying in a way</p>
<p>that would be painful.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t fear having my life be over.</p>
<p>Now, as a mother, I think I fear dying</p>
<p>before my daughter is ready to be without me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s really what I fear.</p>
<p>And frankly, honestly, I fear my husband dying before me</p>
<p>much more than I fear my own death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that love and social attachment again.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I know it&rsquo;s just gonna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel like I wish I was dead.</p>
<p>A final question about life.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there isn&rsquo;t one meaning of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like many meanings of life.</p>
<p>And you use different ones on different days.</p>
<p>But for me.</p>
<p>Depending on the day.</p>
<p>But for me, I would say sometimes the meaning of life</p>
<p>is to understand, to make meaning actually.</p>
<p>The meaning of life is to make meaning.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s to leave the world</p>
<p>just slightly a little bit better</p>
<p>than like the Johnny Appleseed view, you know?</p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of life is to clear the path</p>
<p>for my daughter or for my students.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>even in moments where you&rsquo;re looking at the sky</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re by the ocean.</p>
<p>Or sometimes for me it&rsquo;s even like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see a weed poking out of a crack</p>
<p>in a sidewalk, you know?</p>
<p>And you just have this overwhelming sense</p>
<p>of the wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Like the world is, just like the physical world</p>
<p>is so wondrous and you just get very immersed</p>
<p>in the moment, like the sensation of the moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one meaning of life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a population of instances</p>
<p>just like any other category.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Lisa.</p>
<p>The first time we spoke is I think if not the,</p>
<p>then one of, I think it&rsquo;s the first conversation I had</p>
<p>that basically launched this podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually the first conversation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that launched this podcast.</p>
<p>And now we get to finally do it the right way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you,</p>
<p>that you spent time with me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for hopefully the many more books you write.</p>
<p>Certainly can&rsquo;t wait to, I already read this book,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t wait to listen to it</p>
<p>because as you said offline that you&rsquo;re reading it</p>
<p>and I think you have a great voice.</p>
<p>You have a great, I don&rsquo;t know what the nice way to put it,</p>
<p>but maybe NPR voice in the best version of what that is.</p>
<p>So thanks again for talking today.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
