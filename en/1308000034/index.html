    <p>Friberg Friberg, what&rsquo;s up? It seems like you have a piece of shit on the side of your mouth, or is that a birthmark?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oh, no, that&rsquo;s birth. I got you</p>
<p>Did you record that</p>
<p>Look at this guy</p>
<p>He takes his shirt off for one fucking selfie and now everybody who&rsquo;s fat and pale on the show</p>
<p>The other three of us is gonna be ridiculed. I&rsquo;m having steak tonight as te aka tonight</p>
<p>Lifting twice a week now. Oh, come on sacks. Come get some let&rsquo;s fucking go three two</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast with me again the dictator himself</p>
<p>Show off Polly hop a tia</p>
<p>Rainman David Sachs definitely with us. Definitely a great driver. His dad lets him drive in the driveway and of course</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s favorite the queen of quinoa the science conductor himself</p>
<p>David free bird queen the Queen</p>
<p>Lot of activity online. It&rsquo;s been a little bit of chaos since we all got together here. I</p>
<p>Guess we should talk about this Apple story with</p>
<p>Antonio Garcia Martinez</p>
<p>You may have heard that he was hired by Apple to I guess run</p>
<p>Their ad efforts and I have a little bit of information on kind of what he was gonna do there in terms of ads</p>
<p>Which is really interesting</p>
<p>But tell us tell us tell us tell us. Okay. Well, anyway, you know how we&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>Start at the beginning and assume people don&rsquo;t know who Antonio Garcia Martinez Antonio Garcia Martinez was a Facebook developer</p>
<p>He is some really smart guy. He uses a lot of big words and wrote a book called chaos monkeys</p>
<p>which is a great book where he takes a</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>Jack Kerouac kind of you know, a lot of prose and</p>
<p>He wrote this book about his time at Facebook</p>
<p>The problem is he said some things in the book that would be five years later</p>
<p>problematic at the time they were actually considered problematic by some folks and</p>
<p>In the full quote maybe</p>
<p>Less problematic, but he was essentially ousted because of the following problematic quote</p>
<p>The quote is most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak</p>
<p>Cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness and generally full of shit. They have their self regarding</p>
<p>entitlement feminism and</p>
<p>ceaselessly vaunt their independence, but the reality is come the</p>
<p>Epidemic plague or foreign invasion they become precisely the sort of useless baggage you trade for a box of shotgun shells or a jerrycan of</p>
<p>diesel</p>
<p>and they shorten that quote to be that most women are soft and weak and</p>
<p>Full of shit. So in contact in context in this book</p>
<p>He was contrasting the Bay Area women he had dated with the mother of his kids</p>
<p>Who he describes as strong and tall and tough and amazing</p>
<p>but still the quotes a little gnarly and the quote out, you know when it&rsquo;s out of context becomes particularly gnarly and of course</p>
<p>This led to a petition at Apple which then led to him being fired</p>
<p>Which now is going to lead to him probably getting a 10 million dollar settlement</p>
<p>of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of hypocrisy being brought up here because Apple has allegedly been using or</p>
<p>Apple supply chain has slave labor in it from the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities</p>
<p>and obviously</p>
<p>Apple gave dr. Dre</p>
<p>billions of dollars for beats by Dre and</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>Has a even more misogynistic</p>
<p>series of lyrics and was also accused of physically assaulting I</p>
<p>Believe his wife and other people he dated who dr. Dre dr. Dre. Yeah</p>
<p>So anyway</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Okay, there you go next story no, I&rsquo;m happy to jump into this</p>
<p>I think in Jason, I think you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you focus a little bit too much and I saw your your pod with Zach Colius on this</p>
<p>A lot of good takes but I think you&rsquo;re a little too focused on what AGM as I think it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>just call him by his initials what he did as opposed to what the employees at Apple did and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least four things that Apple did or five things that Apple did wrong</p>
<p>I mean number one, I think there was a really good reason not to hire this guy</p>
<p>Which is that he wrote a best-selling tell-all book about the last big tech company he worked at</p>
<p>So why if you&rsquo;re a big tech company, why in the world would you hire him?</p>
<p>So that was stupid decision number one, but they did decide to hire him and once they hire him</p>
<p>They got a team like any other employee and give him a chance to show what he can do</p>
<p>And so that leads to mistake number two, which is these 2,000 employees who signed this petition</p>
<p>Really distorted and took out of context that passage and I know the passage is cringe. Okay, but I think it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>Passage is cringe. Okay</p>
<p>And gnarly and and it could you know, certainly appear sexist</p>
<p>But you have to put it in its context and the the larger con this is a work of literature. This is a best-selling</p>
<p>Book, it&rsquo;s what 150,000 words. They&rsquo;re taking 150 words out of context and the context was like you said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s describing the mother of his children the love of his life and as this sort of Linda Hamilton esque in Terminator type figure or</p>
<p>Charlize Theron in Mad Max and</p>
<p>This passage is not in there to describe all women. It&rsquo;s just basically a literary flourish to contrast</p>
<p>the this woman that he loves</p>
<p>Being such a badass compared to every other woman and and you know when Kara Swisher interviewed AGM five years ago</p>
<p>She brought this passage. She explained it and she said yeah, okay, I get it</p>
<p>So, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly the case that people can understand the context if they choose to and they simply are not</p>
<p>Choosing to understand the context which brings me to mistake number three, which is these 2,000 employees</p>
<p>Lied in their petition by claiming that their safety is threatened by Apple hiring AGM</p>
<p>That is simply untrue. It&rsquo;s physically impossible in the era of zoom when everyone&rsquo;s working from home</p>
<p>But this guy is not a threat to anyone&rsquo;s safety</p>
<p>But they you but they use that claim</p>
<p>They make that claim because they know that if you accuse someone of threatening your safety</p>
<p>It will trigger the machinery of HR to remove that person from the workplace. This is the language of safety ism and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Specific tactic to basically get somebody canceled and removed from the workplace</p>
<p>Okay, and then that leads to the the the next mistake</p>
<p>Mistake number four, which is the bosses of the Apple caved into this pressure. They were total cowards</p>
<p>They never even gave AGM the chance to explain himself. They never asked him. What did you intend by this passage?</p>
<p>What were you trying to do? And by the way, they knew about this book when they say it&rsquo;s even worse</p>
<p>They knew about the book</p>
<p>They had read it and they talked to many people as when a big time when a big tech company</p>
<p>Hires somebody for a major position like this. They call all the records</p>
<p>Uncovered and dealt with of course, they knew about it</p>
<p>And then when the mob complains they fire him summarily without subjecting the decision to proper HR processes</p>
<p>This is HR by mob rule. It&rsquo;s totally unacceptable</p>
<p>No company should be run this way</p>
<p>And then finally that brings us number five is that in explaining?</p>
<p>Their decision and trying to justify their cowardice and giving it to the mob</p>
<p>They said that they fired him because of his behavior</p>
<p>AGM never had a chance to engage in any behavior. He barely started at the job</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t because of his behavior. This is because of the book that he wrote five years ago</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re saying is that if you ever publish a written work at any time in your life</p>
<p>Years and years ago that that can somehow constitute present-day behavior and that other people in the workplace</p>
<p>Can have a problem with that be that this is not behavior and this is why he&rsquo;s gonna have a giant</p>
<p>Defamation suit and settlement because they are making him unemployable in the tech industry</p>
<p>Yeah by claiming that he was fired for some some sexist behavior. He was not what do you think?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll get paid in a settlement. I put it at 10</p>
<p>10 million. Well, I was just thinking he&rsquo;s a half million dollar a year employee to a million and with his RSU</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just put it at a million unemployed for 10 to 20 years because of this or the damages to his reputation</p>
<p>And present value that back. Yeah, so and yeah, so I think 10 million is the number</p>
<p>my curiosity in this was just</p>
<p>Did those 2,000 employees feel the same way about dr. Dre?</p>
<p>Of course, or did they do they feel the same way about some of the movies that they sell in the iTunes Store?</p>
<p>Or do they feel the same way about some of the games that they enable?</p>
<p>In the app store or some of the subscriptions that are sold</p>
<p>Right, do they care do they care that much about what&rsquo;s happening in their Chinese supply chain?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it seems at least on the outside</p>
<p>The answer is no, but it would be interesting to get an explanation of that from the same HR people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the guy should have been fired or not</p>
<p>but I do think that you should have a predictable standard and every company is allowed to do what they want if</p>
<p>The standard at Apple is that we are going to hold you accountable</p>
<p>For everything you&rsquo;ve done in the past irrespective of whether you&rsquo;ve disavowed it or not</p>
<p>So be it that&rsquo;s their right and I think that the employees of that company have a right to do that</p>
<p>I think they said if you start to arbitrarily enforce it</p>
<p>you go down this weird place, which is like</p>
<p>Basically, I think what they&rsquo;re saying is if it&rsquo;s good for business</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to ignore it if it&rsquo;s not obvious that it&rsquo;s good for business will act because it&rsquo;s a low-cost way</p>
<p>of keeping the masses</p>
<p>You know that the medicated</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s even scarier to the 2000 people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you know, maybe they should feel proud that they got their pound of flesh</p>
<p>but they really should figure out how they want to stand on all these other points because to cherry pick puts</p>
<p>Puts the whole company in just a weird posture. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not scalable freeberg</p>
<p>Uh, i&rsquo;m less interested in the hypocrisy and the values debate, which is obvious</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the first order</p>
<p>Point with all this stuff. It&rsquo;s like do the employees have the right values?</p>
<p>Is there hypocrisy by management? Is there hypocrisy by the employees?</p>
<p>What what strikes me though is um a failure of leadership at these organizations</p>
<p>You know you guys think back to brian armstrong&rsquo;s kind of purging of the woke mob and the political discourse</p>
<p>That was happening at coinbase a few months ago</p>
<p>He took a point of strong leadership</p>
<p>To a new level and I think it highlighted when the leader steps up and says this is how we&rsquo;re going to operate</p>
<p>These are how we&rsquo;re going to make decisions and puts his foot down</p>
<p>Uh people will leave and you evolve the culture</p>
<p>And I think it indicates to me that certain companies as they&rsquo;ve gotten really big and really successful</p>
<p>like apple and even alphabet</p>
<p>and various other kind of large tech companies</p>
<p>The leader is no longer lead the employees lead the narrative on culture and the narrative on values</p>
<p>And um, you know, it speaks to two things one is that there perhaps aren&rsquo;t founder</p>
<p>Leaders running those organizations anymore that there are managers</p>
<p>Whose job is critically important whose job is to keep the wheels on and keep the wheels from falling off</p>
<p>So they have more to lose</p>
<p>And they are constantly trying to protect the downside than they are trying to be aggressive about growing to the upside</p>
<p>um, and then I think it&rsquo;s just uh, you know, secondly this kind of um,</p>
<p>You know failure, uh to kind of define</p>
<p>What your values are from a leadership perspective and the void gets filled by the employees the void gets filled by the mob</p>
<p>And so while it&rsquo;s this one kind of, you know, debatable point today and this one kind of hypocritical point today</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to see that this isn&rsquo;t happening at other companies that are founder-led and if it is</p>
<p>The you know, the culture gets jobs would have handled this completely different</p>
<p>Steve jobs would not have let his employees tell him who or he would have stopped</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a discussion about a really clear point of view about who we hire why we hire them</p>
<p>and how we make decisions and not let the</p>
<p>Democratic kind of rule or the you know, um, it&rsquo;s not even democratic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like all employees took a vote</p>
<p>How much of this chamath has to do with the coddling of silicon valley employees for two decades vis-a-vis?</p>
<p>You know you get driven to school on your school bus you sit on you know, you get your lunch prepared for you</p>
<p>We do your dry cleaning every friday you get to come and ask challenging questions to the leaders and this concept of like</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Everybody has a voice at work as opposed to this is a company controlled by shareholders and or a founder and you work for it</p>
<p>And there is a trade of services here vis-a-vis what toby had to say at shopify</p>
<p>Which is this is not a family. This is a sports team. You are here to perform</p>
<p>We are here to perform for our customers the end</p>
<p>So the in fact if you if you had a chance and maybe nick we can post it in the show notes</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>The email that toby luteke wrote to shopify employees was unbelievable that to me is like that&rsquo;s a tour de force</p>
<p>that should be basically like</p>
<p>That should be minted and sold as an nft</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an nft we forgot about those and it was it was it was just an incredible email adjacent to your point and the way</p>
<p>That that started if I I may be getting these facts wrong, but there was an emoji of a noose</p>
<p>inside of a slack channel</p>
<p>Um, and then and then folks got quite upset with it</p>
<p>And so I think toby&rsquo;s response was to basically shut down the whole channel</p>
<p>And say hey guys</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re losing the script about why we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>You know, I think brian armstrong&rsquo;s essay was a version of that</p>
<p>The question is why are we here if I had to guess I think it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve pumped so much money into silicon valley companies</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know where to spend it</p>
<p>And so I actually think that what we&rsquo;ve really done is overhired far too many people into many of these companies</p>
<p>And so they kind of are very smart people</p>
<p>Sitting around twiddling their thumbs. And so obviously they&rsquo;re just going to get distracted meaning</p>
<p>I remember like, you know</p>
<p>At facebook there was barely enough people to keep the lights on for a while</p>
<p>Then I remember by the time I was leaving I was like wow</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too many people here a lot of them and most of them are all really really smart</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me what many of them did</p>
<p>And you know people would look at me and then say oh, you know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really arrogant thing to say and that&rsquo;s not true and everybody&rsquo;s valuable</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Um, you know if you look at google</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought like that company could probably run by 2 000 people</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s 200 000 people. So the 198 other thousand of them need to find something to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the same at apple</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the same at all these big tech companies and that&rsquo;s the leverage that you get from technology. It&rsquo;s naturally</p>
<p>massively deflationary</p>
<p>So but if you keep pumping billions and billions and billions of dollars into these companies</p>
<p>Where the app experience is written by 50 or 100 critical people or managed by 500 or a thousand critical people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>This is the natural byproduct</p>
<p>I think which by the way freeberg said organizations want to grow right like</p>
<p>How many organizations say, you know, we should be smaller. We don&rsquo;t need this many people, you know, you&rsquo;re saying something really important</p>
<p>Not enough founders and boards understand the difference between growing a business and growing an org</p>
<p>Those are two totally different things and the reason is because we&rsquo;ve lost sight of very simple financial metrics in silicon valley</p>
<p>Meaning if you go to any other industry where there is a cost of capital</p>
<p>People understand what return on invested capital means they know how to measure it</p>
<p>Yeah, they know what operating leverage means. They know what margin expansion means. We only have valuation and they seek that out here</p>
<p>We think about exactly as you said valuation and so this idea that</p>
<p>Having a hundred people do the work and see margins lift is antithetical to the silicon valley culture</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oh as margins go up. Let&rsquo;s just keep running the same profitable business, but instead have a 500 people a thousand</p>
<p>What do you think you&rsquo;re an operations machine people would say on a coo basis</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the top three to five in the history of the valley. What do you say coo man?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I mean look chamath is right that in a company that&rsquo;s well-run and well-led where uh people</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have time on their hands to engage in these shenanigans</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I think I think that&rsquo;s absolutely right</p>
<p>I think companies and startups are increasingly have to choose whether they want to be apple or whether they want to be</p>
<p>um coinbase or shop5 for that matter and just this this week at apple</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new petition circling now. There&rsquo;s a petition called by thousands of employees calling for tim cook</p>
<p>To denounce the israelis and endorse the palestinian side of the conflict. Yeah, how&rsquo;s that gonna work?</p>
<p>Well, of course you have a position on abortion. Is there an abortion position at well</p>
<p>But but now that they&rsquo;ve given into the the woke mob, there&rsquo;s no reason for the mob to stop</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be circulating a petition every week and that&rsquo;s kind of the point is</p>
<p>So and actually agm himself had a really good quote about this. He did a great interview with</p>
<p>matt taibbi</p>
<p>And um, he laid out the choice that companies face like this. He said it&rsquo;s interject. This is um,</p>
<p>Antonio martinez saying is interjecting the whole fucking twitter cesspool</p>
<p>With all the dog piles and all the performative signaling and all that crap into a corporate setting</p>
<p>And replicating those dynamics and calling it work. That&rsquo;s basically what happened is what&rsquo;s happening is you you&rsquo;re these employees are performing twitter</p>
<p>at work</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re on on slack and they&rsquo;re pretending like it&rsquo;s really work and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>And I think you know founders are going to have to make a decision</p>
<p>Do you stand up and take a uh, brian armstrong like position or a toby position or do you eventually degenerate?</p>
<p>Into some sort of or a base camp, by the way</p>
<p>Even base camp the most woke virtual signaling founders on twitter</p>
<p>decided to take that&rsquo;s right the most libertarian or</p>
<p>Spartan approach, you know stoic approach of toby to give you uh, toby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Well base camp just to finish the base camp thought so to base camp try to accommodate</p>
<p>This sort of like woke mentality and what they found is that they got pushed so far</p>
<p>It became so distracting. They eventually had to move to the armstrong position and that&rsquo;s kind of my point is once you yeah</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going to move to that. Yeah, that&rsquo;s my point</p>
<p>I mean and if you don&rsquo;t believe what I what I said was like listen if you believe that a organization</p>
<p>That allows political speech and this kind of stuff as a primary function inside the company</p>
<p>Will then go build a competitor to base camp and show that that system works better. Here&rsquo;s toby&rsquo;s quote</p>
<p>To help you make this more clear to team members. Here are some pointers about what shopify is not</p>
<p>Shopify like any for-profit company is not a family. The very idea is preposterous</p>
<p>You are born into a family you never choose it and they can&rsquo;t unfamily you</p>
<p>It should be massively obvious that shopify is not a family</p>
<p>But I see people even leaders casually use the term like shopifam</p>
<p>Which will cause the members of our teams especially junior ones that have never worked anywhere else</p>
<p>To get the wrong impression the dangers of family thinking in quotes are that it becomes incredibly hard to let poor performers</p>
<p>Go shopify is a team italicized not a family</p>
<p>We literally only want the best people in the world</p>
<p>The reason why you join shopify is because I hope all other people you met during the interview process</p>
<p>Were really smart caring and committed. This is magic and it creates a virtuous</p>
<p>Magnetism on talented people because very few people in the world have this in themselves people who don&rsquo;t should not be part of this team</p>
<p>I mean when I was um, when I was that strong</p>
<p>when I was at facebook, we used to convene the senior team and</p>
<p>You know, I was like I want I really want to fire the bottom five or ten percent of the company of you</p>
<p>And we would force stack rank and we did it for about three or four years and then the excuse was it&rsquo;s too big</p>
<p>And there are too many people and the roles are too diverse and you can&rsquo;t rank</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t believe that even to this day. I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious who the real</p>
<p>Thousand x kind of employee contributors are and by the way, they exist in every function. There&rsquo;s thousand x salespeople</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s thousand x, you know product managers. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the thousand x people that work in facilities</p>
<p>They exist in every job function</p>
<p>And companies I don&rsquo;t think do a good enough job of figuring out who they are</p>
<p>And so instead what happens is people that are not even 100x or not even a 10x are really more like a 1 or 1.1 x</p>
<p>Can basically hide in all of that noise</p>
<p>And I think that if you could separate hr into two things</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really three things one is like benefits, which is critical</p>
<p>The second is actually like safety and the ability to whistleblow if there&rsquo;s something really nefarious or bad that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>And then the third that&rsquo;s really valuable I think is organizational design, right?</p>
<p>How do you put people in good jobs?</p>
<p>And how do you allow them to have a huge amount of autonomy to run and build a career?</p>
<p>but all of this other policing stuff to me just seems like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It coddles to the lowest 25. I don&rsquo;t know if and this is my intuition to the lowest 25</p>
<p>Performers of every course, of course it does and just to uh, close this story up and wrap to our next</p>
<p>Uh, and tony agm announced that he is going to take a year wait for it to write for sub stack</p>
<p>So he is going to get paid</p>
<p>10 million dollars. I I would guesstimate in a settlement by apple. He&rsquo;s going to get a half million dollar. I&rsquo;ll take the over</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the over</p>
<p>Only we can bet on this</p>
<p>I set such a good line. We can bet on it. We can bet on it. I&rsquo;ll take the over</p>
<p>Okay, I set the line at 10. Anybody want the under?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take you&rsquo;ll take the uh</p>
<p>Well, go go give it a give a different bet and i&rsquo;ll think you got a different line</p>
<p>You could set a different line set a different line. I think 10 is a good line</p>
<p>Because you gotta think like if they offer him seven or eight million</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be something like that. I don&rsquo;t know what the big what the number is, but we&rsquo;ll never know i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll make a line</p>
<p>15.6. I&rsquo;ll take the under i&rsquo;ll take the under wow</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take the under. Yeah, 15 is way too much way too much david&rsquo;s quiet. I&rsquo;d say under 15. Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a good line</p>
<p>Good thing</p>
<p>Is a good line</p>
<p>Okay, let me do 11.5. What do you take tamar can afford the book against all three of us?</p>
<p>11.5</p>
<p>Tramont takes the over 11.5</p>
<p>Freeberg sacks. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know under</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just tell you why if you look at the last four-year compounding of apple stock</p>
<p>Right, and so if you think about reasonable number of grants as his level of seniority plus the imputed compounding</p>
<p>Plus whatever he would have gone. You should be part of his team</p>
<p>somebody said in this clip because</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument is I I do think you end up getting to probably 20 million</p>
<p>And then you got to include you get a buyout. Yeah, you get a buyout now price at 15 in color</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve also also you could make the argument. They&rsquo;ve rendered him unemployable in the industry. So and then there&rsquo;s four gone</p>
<p>Incomparable in the future then it could be 20 mental suffering. What about suffering? He is going to suffer</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to need to be on meds. My client is suffering. He&rsquo;s in therapy twice a week. He can&rsquo;t get out of bed</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to be able to be in functional relationships</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s too scared to leave the house. He should wait on the substack because he&rsquo;s going to make so much money on substack</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to mitigate his damages</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>Do you guys know what apple&rsquo;s market cap divided by employees is</p>
<p>Apple is apple&rsquo;s market probably seven million an employee</p>
<p>Anyone else?</p>
<p>Wait a second. There&rsquo;s a hundred thousand employees and it&rsquo;s worth two trillion</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s 150 000 employees 2.1 trillion. So it&rsquo;s 14 million an employee</p>
<p>So the other way to think about it is if apple&rsquo;s like going to lose one or two good employees over this</p>
<p>Um, you know, they&rsquo;d uh, they&rsquo;d happily pay up to get uh to get the guy to be quiet</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s worth one employee to pay 14 million dollars</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, well, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not dividing by all the slave labor in china</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll recalc i&rsquo;ll recalc</p>
<p>They actually cause zero</p>
<p>That was bad, sorry</p>
<p>I mean, this is the hypocrisy of apple</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve literally got slave labor in their supply chain. Not that they wanted in their supply chain</p>
<p>How do you know that? How do you know that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go through this because like this is a common narrative</p>
<p>But has anyone actually like gotten to the bottom of well, that&rsquo;s why I said reported. I mean, yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, it is it is known again. Like I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like pushing narratives</p>
<p>Actually, I tweeted something that i&rsquo;m well, I retweeted something that came from I think a pretty valid source</p>
<p>Um that author from the atlantic who I think is pretty legit</p>
<p>Also, I just think just in terms of his quote if he had taken the word woman out of the quote</p>
<p>Uh, most people in the bay area are soft and weak</p>
<p>In a zombie apocalypse. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re recruiting from the bay area. Uh, but related to this story, uh in terms of chamat&rsquo;s point about</p>
<p>you know, uh</p>
<p>1000x performers</p>
<p>America is uh, really doing a bad job at math and gary tan</p>
<p>The venture capitalist retweeted and participated in a tweet thread about immigrants</p>
<p>Um who know that standardized test is probably your best shot at getting somewhere</p>
<p>Uh, your money social science can&rsquo;t take you the rules are well standardized and he tells this story about this</p>
<p>But there was a persuasion article</p>
<p>Um about us failing math and that they&rsquo;re going to be in california</p>
<p>Getting rid of the gifted programs for math because it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>to the kids who are not gifted as a kid who is</p>
<p>was not gifted</p>
<p>uh, and to the</p>
<p>Three kids on the program who weren&rsquo;t gifted programs or at least two of you were</p>
<p>I have no problem with there being a gifted program, but any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s shameful. Yeah, it really is. I mean like we are we are really doing our level best to just completely</p>
<p>Fuck our population. Why I mean, why is this even how could this even be possible? It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Like just like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of like the equivalent</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the moral equivalent of actually saying you know what we&rsquo;re going to eliminate welfare for the bottom</p>
<p>five percent</p>
<p>Like our job as a society is to kind of like find</p>
<p>The broadest set of solutions for the most number of people and solve for both extremes</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re dealing with education you both need to understand that there are folks that need</p>
<p>Some kind of structural support look when I came to canada</p>
<p>I had esl right english as a second language you take that so that you can learn the native language of a country</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t mean that I was stupid. It just meant that I was behind, you know</p>
<p>If I had dyslexia or something else, I would need some kind of support</p>
<p>One of my children had a speech impediment. We had a speech therapist</p>
<p>This is what you do</p>
<p>But on the other side if you have a kid who&rsquo;s an incredibly high performer who has the potential to just completely crush</p>
<p>Hey, like you should be able to give that kid a pathway to achieve and give back</p>
<p>So the idea that you would eliminate anything at the extremes is kind of completely uncompassionate and stupid just totally fucking stupid</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s in the name of having a more equitable math class again. I hate that word. Please don&rsquo;t use that</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t use that word that is that is the least by the way this this I mean this goes back to the point</p>
<p>I made a few episodes ago that you know, you can have progress or you can have equality</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very difficult to have both and you know</p>
<p>If you want to try and make everyone equal and give no one</p>
<p>The opportunity to have more or get more than anyone else because of whatever the circumstance may be whether it&rsquo;s earned. No</p>
<p>No, but this is my point like you know</p>
<p>You limit the ability for everyone to to progress as a group because we&rsquo;re now limiting the ability for folks to take calculus</p>
<p>I know equality look i&rsquo;ll use a video game example equality means we all get to play grand theft auto not that we have</p>
<p>Somebody who actually plays for us and gets to the same answer and just gives you a ticket that says</p>
<p>The same score yeah, so so the so the that&rsquo;s that is what equality means is that we all get to play</p>
<p>And we all get a chance versus equity which is leveling everyone</p>
<p>Equity is leveling everybody and saying here&rsquo;s your result, right?</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s the same as this other person&rsquo;s whatever the misnomer is</p>
<p>But the notion of leveling everyone where no one can be ahead of anyone else by too far</p>
<p>Uh, obviously limits as a group our ability for the top decile to to increment or the top quartile to increment</p>
<p>I gotta think look. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s again use. Yeah, let&rsquo;s again use our friends because instead of ours, but you know</p>
<p>We know a lot of really smart people</p>
<p>Um who have really really smart kids</p>
<p>We also know people in general that are in tough circumstances who also probably have really smart kids</p>
<p>Just purely selfishly for me. I want those kids</p>
<p>Doing the best they can to figure out what the hell they can invent for us in the future</p>
<p>Why would you slow those kids down?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like saying you know, what like how about a black athlete would you would it be preposterous to say?</p>
<p>You know what? You don&rsquo;t have a right to go to the nba and make money for your family</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to slow you down</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s another white kid that&rsquo;s going to go through four years of college</p>
<p>So, you know what you&rsquo;re going to have to go through four years of college and you&rsquo;re going to have to pay for it</p>
<p>Well, actually what I would propose, uh is when I go up to dunk that we just the rim automatically lowers two feet</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so I can dunk and then when you go for a layup, we&rsquo;ll just raise it six inches</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be more equitable for me. That&rsquo;s more equitable. Yes more equity. Let me let me let me add another layer to this</p>
<p>So I I agree with you with you guys that what we should be thinking about is opportunity</p>
<p>We should always be asking what increases opportunity for the most people and that&rsquo;s how we should measure</p>
<p>Political programs and we&rsquo;re not doing that here</p>
<p>We are sort of leveling down but I would say it&rsquo;s even more nefarious than that</p>
<p>Which is I think what&rsquo;s happening is that the education establishment is completely failing</p>
<p>Our kids and our schools and what they&rsquo;re trying to do is destroy the evidence of that failure</p>
<p>Wow, and and so they&rsquo;re hiding they&rsquo;re hiding the results now this persuasion piece</p>
<p>Yes, this persuasion piece lays out the statistics which are pretty grim</p>
<p>Okay, so according to these like global measurements by OECD</p>
<p>Okay math proficiency in the u.s. We rank 37 in the world</p>
<p>Okay, and there&rsquo;s only 37 developed nations in the world according to the developed. So we&rsquo;re last among developed countries</p>
<p>China, which is our main global competitor is number one</p>
<p>Okay, and we achieve these horrible results despite ranking fifth in the world in per pupil spending</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a spending problem. Okay</p>
<p>and as we know</p>
<p>To the extent we do have high performing math students in the u.s. A huge majority of them are actually foreign born</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re actually kind of cheating our numbers a little bit. It&rsquo;s even worse than it appears now</p>
<p>What is the education establishment doing about this? How are they hiding the failure? Well</p>
<p>When school comes back in the fall, they&rsquo;re planning to eliminate accelerated math</p>
<p>Okay, that means that there&rsquo;s no more algebra for eighth graders who are ready to take it on</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more calculus for high schoolers who want to you know</p>
<p>Do like the ap classes and get a jump on stem, you know for college</p>
<p>The entire idea of gifted students is now under attack like we talked about in the name of equity</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a catch-all for every bad idea</p>
<p>And the university california system has now abandoned the sat and act</p>
<p>So they temporarily got rid of those requirements during the pandemic, but now</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve used it as an excuse let&rsquo;s never waste a crisis and now they say they&rsquo;re not bringing back the requirements until at least</p>
<p>2025 and you can bet it&rsquo;s never going to return at all. And so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get rid of measuring how bad we are at math. So we won&rsquo;t have to think about it</p>
<p>they just want to give everyone a gold star and a pat on the back and</p>
<p>Say how you know, this reminds me of sax is when you threw away the um</p>
<p>The digital scale I got you</p>
<p>Ha ha ha right. Yeah, i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not fat because i&rsquo;m not measuring it. Great</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&rsquo;s like we really it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the movie idiocracy</p>
<p>It literally we are doing the movie. Have you guys seen it?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just uh, why don&rsquo;t we just eliminate all admissions programs at every university and just have one global admissions board?</p>
<p>Where every campus is the same what is the difference between mit?</p>
<p>Um and stanford and caltech and the university of arkansas in my opinion there shouldn&rsquo;t be it&rsquo;s more equitable</p>
<p>To just have somebody go close to home because you can save money, you know carbon emissions are lower, right?</p>
<p>You can just take the bus to the local school competition. You can have one centralized place teach you why have anybody basic course?</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>If I said this you you&rsquo;d think that I was a crazy person</p>
<p>except that&rsquo;s basically what we&rsquo;re now telling all of our high school i&rsquo;m also getting rid of michelin stars and i&rsquo;d like yelp to take</p>
<p>off their</p>
<p>Review system because it&rsquo;s not equitable like we should not have michelin stars anymore</p>
<p>Every show every restaurant&rsquo;s the same every restaurant you get three quarters of a star</p>
<p>We should not the health department should not give ranks of letters and they should not be forced to post it because that&rsquo;s inequitable. Absolutely</p>
<p>You know, yeah, also you can game you can game the health test you could literally just follow the rules</p>
<p>let me just ask the um the counterpoint question, which is uh,</p>
<p>Uh standardized testing for example</p>
<p>Benefits people that can afford tutors and special</p>
<p>You know classes to get ahead</p>
<p>And there are more tutors</p>
<p>Yeah, therefore</p>
<p>Well, therefore it&rsquo;s higher income people that can always well</p>
<p>The point is they can always layer on additional tutoring. They can always layer on additional classes</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re therefore there&rsquo;s a finite number of math. It&rsquo;s a finite score friedberg. You can only get 800 on the math</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll be somewhat. Um</p>
<p>Flip-floppy here. I don&rsquo;t believe in standardized tests that much. I never did well particularly in standardized tests</p>
<p>I do think that they can be gamed but that&rsquo;s different from what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re saying is if kids show aptitude</p>
<p>We are explicitly choosing to not give them a chance to develop at their potential</p>
<p>And the problem is we do this in other areas. We do it in athletics</p>
<p>We do it in music. We do it in the arts, but we&rsquo;re not going to do it in stem</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re choosing to do. That is what&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>So choose to get rid of the sat or act whatever you want. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>But if you are the lebron james of physics, jesus christ, like let that kid become the lebron james of physics</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you like I I am I got into uc berkeley because I had great standardized test scores because I had</p>
<p>An aptitude. What was your sat freeberg? Let&rsquo;s do this. Um, I got a</p>
<p>Uh, let&rsquo;s do this an 800 math and I think it was a 720 verbal</p>
<p>Okay, so you got a 15 20 out of 1600 at the time. I got</p>
<p>And I got an 800 on the math</p>
<p>I was obviously sax. Go ahead. I was uh, 750 math. Um 720 verbal</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>70 are you writing this down? This is free. This is pre the inflation. There was a big uh,</p>
<p>I was a I was 15 10 on the sat. Oh, we were</p>
<p>Okay, so I woke up 400 points 500 points behind each of you in in canada</p>
<p>I was just kind of like we didn&rsquo;t even write it but I went and I wrote it just for shits and giggles and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Do well, I didn&rsquo;t do well like you just said you weren&rsquo;t good at standardized tests. So what are you talking about?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the top three percent. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, I know but generally like I wasn&rsquo;t a good test taker. I was in probation in college academic</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;m not a good testing. But look the the reason why these tests got invented was actually to prevent discrimination</p>
<p>Um, I think it was back in like the 50s, right?</p>
<p>You know, I think it was like and at that time it was jews being kept out of the ivy league and</p>
<p>One of the ways that they corrected for that was they made everyone take the same test</p>
<p>And so you could see the scores and it would shine some light</p>
<p>on, you know making sure that people didn&rsquo;t just get in because they were legacies that they got in because</p>
<p>Um, you know, they had good good scores</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been decades of work since then to try and eliminate bias in the test</p>
<p>And so the the claims of bias now in the test really aren&rsquo;t supported now, right to freeberg&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>Obviously that if you take some rich kid who lives in the suburbs who gets a 1400 and you compare that</p>
<p>To a kid in the inner city who doesn&rsquo;t have who grew up poor doesn&rsquo;t have the advantages and that kid gets a 1300</p>
<p>Well, which score is better probably the 1300</p>
<p>And so you can take that into account in my view in the admissions process, but eliminating the scores all together</p>
<p>Why would you want to have less information to make a decision?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason not to get rid of these I would just think more holistically about how you accept students and I mean</p>
<p>Is it more competition?</p>
<p>And having better teachers what we should be focusing on here as opposed to even standardized testing or god forbid canceling programs</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just invest in more competition for schools</p>
<p>well, so in canada, we had this thing where when I was graduating we had</p>
<p>specific different kinds of math contests and computer science contests and other</p>
<p>Things that you could write the putnam</p>
<p>Etc. And uh</p>
<p>Those things were actually really instructive because they were purely verticalized things that could test your aptitude</p>
<p>And the school that I went to university of waterloo would look at a lot of those things and adjust for it because my grades</p>
<p>Were decent</p>
<p>But my some of those one this one specific math test I took was pretty good</p>
<p>I remember and then they would adjust it exactly as david said to what is this kid&rsquo;s background and his circumstances and they called it</p>
<p>a french factor they would just adjust my marks and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I got into waterloo and I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to so</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways where you can be smart about it</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re talking about guys don&rsquo;t lose sight of what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>We are actually going to cut all these kids off at the knees starting in grade eight</p>
<p>So forget about all of this stuff by the time that these kids graduate. They&rsquo;re going to be I honestly they&rsquo;re going to be like</p>
<p>Really dumb the problem. The problem ultimately isn&rsquo;t just measurement. It&rsquo;s the denial of opportunity to learn</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about it&rsquo;s about getting rid of the learning and the classes</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest problem. You have to move to a state with a gifted program</p>
<p>Now if your kid is really smart or opt out of public education, um, which doesn&rsquo;t help anybody</p>
<p>I mean literally schools don&rsquo;t have to teach we we put it we&rsquo;ve now designed a system to summarize</p>
<p>Schools don&rsquo;t have to compete for students</p>
<p>Teachers don&rsquo;t have to compete for jobs or for their employment. And now we&rsquo;re saying students don&rsquo;t have to compete</p>
<p>So if you remove competition</p>
<p>From the human condition, uh, you&rsquo;re just not going to have any performance</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be no progress and as a species. We need progress. We need to solve global warming</p>
<p>we need to solve a lot of issues and don&rsquo;t we want to live longer and better lives like where is the</p>
<p>optimistic nature of the human species competition is at the core of excellence</p>
<p>And to just take it out of everything the whole stack jake out</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the smartest thing you&rsquo;ve ever said way smarter than 1120 sat score. Thank you</p>
<p>Thank you. Are you sure it&rsquo;s only 1120?</p>
<p>How lame is it that we&rsquo;re still talking about our sat score?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 30 years was the average so in brooklyn when you&rsquo;re 320 points above average david. It&rsquo;s a bfd</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s lame is the four of us all remember down to the number what our score is. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s lame</p>
<p>I think I was 11 20 11 50. I gotta I gotta look it up. Um</p>
<p>all right, uh</p>
<p>Do we want to go to the crypto meltdown or talk about inflation or do we should we dovetail those together?</p>
<p>Or do you just want to go straight to ufos?</p>
<p>well, brian biden just uh, they they just uh, a press release just hit the wire and they just cut the</p>
<p>Infrastructure bill from 2.3 trillion to 1.7 trillion. Oh, so we&rsquo;re doing our job</p>
<p>Here at the all-in podcast and uh, I I I had heard from somebody that there just is not the broad-based support</p>
<p>um for</p>
<p>Uh, the capital gains tax, so that&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And it looks like the corporate tax will probably go to 25</p>
<p>Not even up to 28</p>
<p>and interestingly</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this but one of the biggest features of the bill that has the most popularity is that they&rsquo;re closing this loophole around</p>
<p>IP that sits outside the united states</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>That more than the corporate taxes will raise almost a trillion dollars of revenue. I agree with that one</p>
<p>Why should you put your why is apple? I mean you want to talk about hypocrisy putting their ip in ireland</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t pay taxes. Google does the same. It was everybody&rsquo;s doing that. Why does that exist? It&rsquo;s so un-american</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s a subsidiary that has different taxation on it and you know to kind of</p>
<p>that capital and that uh</p>
<p>And that earnings sits outside the us that ip was made in california. It was not made in dublin</p>
<p>No offense to</p>
<p>You know my home country. I remember facebook. We did that. We did this exact thing</p>
<p>We signed over all the ip and then the irs sued facebook and I remember like I was called either to</p>
<p>I was subpoenaed and we went through like a whole multi-year trial</p>
<p>It may still be going on and it was around this issue, which was the irs said hey facebook</p>
<p>How come you you know, you ported this over there?</p>
<p>And I think facebook&rsquo;s answer was yeah, we paid the tax and I think they did</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think they did anything wrong because the laws allowed it</p>
<p>But it effectively helped shield then tens of billions of dollars of future taxes</p>
<p>I I mean, I remember reading about this and i&rsquo;m like, how does this?</p>
<p>Pass the sniff test. Well, it&rsquo;s where the revenue is recognized jk</p>
<p>So you basically can produce the ip here and then transfer it to your subsidiary</p>
<p>When you transfer it to your subsidiary, you can recognize the earnings in that subsidiary and that subsidiary pays taxes in its local jurisdiction</p>
<p>um, the I think the issue facebook had was that they</p>
<p>Transferred the ip and they undervalued what the future value would be from that ip transfer</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the irs sued them</p>
<p>Is this accounting snafu in terms of like what did you value it out at the moment you transferred it?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another idea. Why doesn&rsquo;t why don&rsquo;t they look at as part of this ip licensing?</p>
<p>Where does the consumption of that ip occur?</p>
<p>And where do the employees who maintain that ip live jk? It&rsquo;s a very smart idea</p>
<p>The problem is that&rsquo;s the slippery slope that then gets to local taxation</p>
<p>You know, the thing is we have all these global tax treaties where these large corporate entities can basically play this game</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not subject to local tax</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s going to really start the undoing of the big monopolies because if you start to abandon</p>
<p>These global tax treaties and you&rsquo;re starting to see it</p>
<p>France is trying to do some stuff. The uk is trying to do some stuff states</p>
<p>Individually in the united states are trying to sue these companies or tax them more</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the first way to chip away at these monopolies is to basically say fuck your global tax treaty</p>
<p>You need to pay x amount of dollars to be here and it already exists because of these, you know</p>
<p>Realist, uh, sorry the retail tax nexuses and how e-commerce companies have to pay local tax in the areas</p>
<p>But once it sort of touches a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>industries</p>
<p>and countries</p>
<p>Uh, I think that you&rsquo;re going to have that that&rsquo;s why I think yellen</p>
<p>Janet yelling yesterday said that you know</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in support of trying to have a global minimum tax of 12</p>
<p>Basically trying to get to the end state and tell every country</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all circle the wagons and agree that we&rsquo;ll all just charge everybody 12% and then we won&rsquo;t go all our separate ways</p>
<p>The the problem is that if you have a lot of usage in a country, you know</p>
<p>That country doesn&rsquo;t care what the taxation is in zimbabwe, right or canada</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like if i&rsquo;m the uk or france</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like I look at the top 20 apps in my country and i&rsquo;m like wait a minute</p>
<p>These guys would be paying me 50 billion dollars a year in tax</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get away from the incentive to to not want to tax these companies right now sax</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have a huge thought on the ip issue</p>
<p>Um, it it seems like I know they&rsquo;re the republican proposal on the infrastructure was six to eight hundred billion</p>
<p>Um biden&rsquo;s proposal initially was 2.3. Chamath is right now. They&rsquo;re down to 1.7</p>
<p>I think the the markets have been choking</p>
<p>on the size of all of this tax and spend</p>
<p>And the there&rsquo;s been all these reports of inflation spiking</p>
<p>And so the gross stocks have just been hammered</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re all expecting big interest rate increases to control this future inflation. So</p>
<p>um biden&rsquo;s been horrible for gross stocks so far and it really I guess that what it shows is that you know,</p>
<p>What are gross stocks gross stocks are future investment and it shows the way that the government can crowd out when you have</p>
<p>Excess government spending I guess you can call it an investment if you want</p>
<p>But when you have excess government spending it starts to crowd out</p>
<p>private investment</p>
<p>Because it raises interest rates and that you know decreases the the value of gross stocks and there&rsquo;s less money that flows into that</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem like the market reaction to the infrastructure bill</p>
<p>and to inflation has</p>
<p>Made biden reconsider his approach and maybe he just came out too hot</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think biden&rsquo;s reconsidering. I think it&rsquo;s people like joe manchin. Um, remember it&rsquo;s a mark warner mark warner</p>
<p>Kristen sinema the the moderate there&rsquo;s a three or four moderate democrats in the senate</p>
<p>Who I think are receiving the message chamath put it really well the last pod</p>
<p>Receiving the message chamath put it really well the last pod that the markets are sending a message to washington</p>
<p>I think some of those centrist democrats read the message. I don&rsquo;t think biden&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Aware of and I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s aware of he doesn&rsquo;t seem too aware of anything to me</p>
<p>But I think the moderate democrats are getting a message</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re telling they&rsquo;re telling the white house the package is too big and they they&rsquo;re um, and I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>The other thing that I think people um may be getting their heads around here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s changed since last week</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a growing body if I had to say like, you know, the beautiful thing about the</p>
<p>The markets is that it is an extremely elegant voting mechanism in the short term, right?</p>
<p>I mean buffet says it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term</p>
<p>But if you look at sentiment and how things are voted on in the public markets in real time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly illustrative. So, um</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a body of people now that are voting a very different scenario than inflation</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re voting for now is this idea that by the fall</p>
<p>A lot of this short-term pent-up demand will have worked its way through the system</p>
<p>And instead we&rsquo;ll be back to this realization that we&rsquo;ve had for the last 20 years, which is hey, wait a minute</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t actually want to buy more of these physical goods. They&rsquo;re going to go back to consuming the way they did before</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to reflexively push towards technology companies again, and we&rsquo;re going to have this rebirth of growth</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You would say well, how would you know that that vote is likely and this one incredible thing happened this last week</p>
<p>Which I just want to throw out here</p>
<p>one thing that I look at is this thing called 10-year break-evens, which is basically a thing that the</p>
<p>federal reserve of st. Louis publishes</p>
<p>And what it basically shows is like what people think collectively trillions of dollars</p>
<p>What the 10-year break-even interest rate is going to be and it peaked last week at two</p>
<p>2.54</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fallen 13 basis points</p>
<p>Just in the last week down to 241</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s sustained or whatever</p>
<p>But there is a growing idea that the worst may be behind us and if you layer on top of this now</p>
<p>biden pulling back</p>
<p>right on</p>
<p>Stimulus because he can&rsquo;t get it done</p>
<p>pulling back on cap gains pulling back on corporate taxation</p>
<p>Um and a more measured policy of investment</p>
<p>We we could all be back. So we&rsquo;re basically taking the medicine and getting back to where we were</p>
<p>But we still have massive asset inflation. We&rsquo;re seeing in houses cars and other things</p>
<p>Well, we may have just pulled forward demand meaning, you know, people are like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m flush with money the savings rate in the united states has been you know</p>
<p>Going at an incredible clip people may pull forward all that spending and say I was going to buy a car</p>
<p>18 months from now or I was going to buy a house two years from now</p>
<p>Fuck it. I&rsquo;m going to do it now because prices are going up too fast</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to miss out</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re out of the market now for the next many number of years and this is what i&rsquo;m saying where you see this</p>
<p>Short-term spike of demand and then things get back to normal if that&rsquo;s what we see</p>
<p>Good times are back in growth stocks</p>
<p>All in podcast sentiment levels go high again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve literally I did like two or three early stage deals recently and I had members of my syndicate say like</p>
<p>How does this valuation make sense and I said to them, you know, it actually doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at it with the traditional metrics, but all valuations are higher at all stages</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m going to selectively, you know overpay</p>
<p>Compared to what we were paying a year or two ago</p>
<p>you know if I really love a company but I will sit out a lot of i&rsquo;m sitting out a lot of rounds right now that</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t get my head around the valuation. So</p>
<p>Hopefully some well, there&rsquo;s always a trickle down</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a trickle down from growth stocks in the public markets to venture right because</p>
<p>The the last private investors like the big funds who do the super late stage stuff</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing an arbitrage on what they pay versus what the company&rsquo;s going to list for publicly</p>
<p>So when they see those valuations go down they adjust and then it works its way all the way down the stack</p>
<p>So, you know growth stocks have just been hammered and especially all the recent listings the ipos and</p>
<p>SPACs and everything and and that&rsquo;s going to trickle its way down I think</p>
<p>To venture it&rsquo;s just a matter of time. We have the yeah</p>
<p>And I think we have the lead indicator on that as clubhouse right which will be the canary in the coal mine</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you guys reconcile explain explain what&rsquo;s going on with clubhouse just for those explain what it is</p>
<p>Okay, so clubhouse is a casual audio space you go into a room</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re immediately taken to a live conversation</p>
<p>With people speaking on stage and an audience audience members can be promoted to the stage and start talking</p>
<p>Wait, hold on. It&rsquo;s in an app and it&rsquo;s all audio. So there&rsquo;s an app audio. There&rsquo;s an app you go in and it&rsquo;s all audio</p>
<p>Yes, so it&rsquo;s like amateur night at a strip club, but for words, uh, or more comedy club, whatever you just bring public on stage</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of like champagne room, but a little different</p>
<p>so anyway</p>
<p>And there we go</p>
<p>Apple 2000 signatures from apple to remove all in from the podcast</p>
<p>We just lost three ranks in the apple podcasting app</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s very interesting about this app is that it had a massive number of downloads during the</p>
<p>pandemic because people were home and people were not doing anything at night because they were sheltering in place and</p>
<p>They had in you know</p>
<p>2 million downloads in january 9.5 million in february of this year and then</p>
<p>Came crashing down 2.7 million in march and 922 in april</p>
<p>But at the same time their valuation over 18 months</p>
<p>Went from 100 million in their seed when they had like three or four thousand users</p>
<p>To a billion to four billion in the last round of financing for a company with zero revenue</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s call it a couple of million people using the app</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting is the same venture firm led all three rounds a la</p>
<p>Sequoia&rsquo;s investment in whatsapp where they did all the private funding</p>
<p>So you have no outside capital marking this valuation a four billion dollar valuation four billion dollars</p>
<p>Well, they got a they got an acquisition offer from twitter for four billion and they they turned was that ever confirmed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it was real</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>So but so basically the reason why the four billion private round happened was so that we keep going as an independent company</p>
<p>They could basically take some chips off the table through secondary and kind of go for the bigger outcome</p>
<p>But yeah, they could have just sold to twitter for four billion</p>
<p>So they may end up regretting that</p>
<p>But like is this really a function of a broader?</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Inflation valuation inflation or is this just a function of there was a company that was a social network with hyper growth</p>
<p>And then it turns out that the product had no stickiness and the hyper growth went away</p>
<p>The souffle collapsed the souffle collapse</p>
<p>Can I can I just point out like and and forgive me if any?</p>
<p>Any of you guys are investors in this company or anyone that&rsquo;s listening cares</p>
<p>But like if this thing came out before youtube</p>
<p>People would say you know, this is interesting, but it needs an asynchronous killer</p>
<p>It needs a thing where you can like record a conversation post it online and people can come and watch it and listen to it</p>
<p>When they want it was always so crazy to me that you had to be logged into the app to listen to what was going</p>
<p>on and if you didn&rsquo;t you missed the conversation and there was no way to like</p>
<p>Go watch the recording of the conversation like am I crazy to think that this was just like I think you</p>
<p>I think you I think you nailed it that they don&rsquo;t have async in there and actually i&rsquo;ve got a little bit of disclosure</p>
<p>to make here</p>
<p>What what the beat got wet</p>
<p>Breaking news story. Okay, so I think I understand what clubhouse did wrong async is a huge part of it</p>
<p>But rather than tell you exactly i&rsquo;m going to show you because i&rsquo;ve been incubating a new app what yes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re on test flight right now</p>
<p>And you guys after this pod I can I can demo it for you</p>
<p>And if you guys if you guys want to invest i&rsquo;m going to close around uh this week for it&rsquo;s getting wet</p>
<p>And so if you guys want to what&rsquo;s our valuation? What&rsquo;s the value? What&rsquo;s our insider all in? What&rsquo;s the bestie vow?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the best?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you guys about it offline. How much how much money do you want to raise?</p>
<p>We already we&rsquo;re raising 10 million bucks and we already have commitments and but i&rsquo;m creating room for you guys. Yeah</p>
<p>500k each</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take sounds like 500k each</p>
<p>Where is it? Let&rsquo;s talk about it offline. But um, but the apps on test flight</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll be ready to launch in a few weeks. Can I can I say wait, what&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>Can you tell me? Yeah, no, i&rsquo;ll say it. It&rsquo;s called call in</p>
<p>Call in call in. I thought it was I thought it was going to be called club mouse</p>
<p>Does this have a uh, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Like are we going to do the podcast on it?</p>
<p>We absolutely could do the podcast on it and it would be awesome. Nick would be out of a job</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think he would like that too much</p>
<p>Quality level, but I think it&rsquo;s good for call-ins if we wanted to do a call-in show it would be good for that</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;d be great. It&rsquo;d be great to do exactly</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called call-in is because the ability for you to take callers is obviously</p>
<p>A huge feature but also like we could host after parties for our fans</p>
<p>To like, you know chop up the latest episode and talk about it. Yeah, these fans are getting crazy</p>
<p>Do you guys see the all in stats twitter handle? I don&rsquo;t know the twitter handle off the top of my head</p>
<p>but somebody&rsquo;s these kids are doing um</p>
<p>uh, they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>machine learning or something to</p>
<p>Know what percentage of time we each speak on the pod and how many monologues and they&rsquo;re doing all these statistics. It&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool. Um, I was gonna say, uh</p>
<p>In defense of clubhouse for a second</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know the app per se but I think like why andreason did all of that in my opinion</p>
<p>Is because they&rsquo;re pressing a hot hand which makes a ton of sense from their perspective</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, I think that they&rsquo;re going for the kill shot because I think they&rsquo;re basically set up</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically set up to become sequoia if if they really I mean, I think if you think about like which two firms are really</p>
<p>Crushing on all cylinders right now, obviously sequoia has always been the perennial number one</p>
<p>But if you think about the the heater that andreason is on it&rsquo;s incredible and so from their perspective</p>
<p>The four billion dollar valuation is less important than what is their real capital at risk?</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably 100 or 150 million which</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of having 40 or 50 billion dollars of aum if you consider the value of all their public positions as well</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really reasonable risk to take so I think if you read it that way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking a shot to try to just you know, go if it does become worth 10 billion or 50 billion</p>
<p>Also, if it only gets sold for 500 million they get their money out first. So what does it matter?</p>
<p>What does it matter they&rsquo;re going for the 100 billion dollar outcome?</p>
<p>I mean they&rsquo;ve seen that instagram sold too soon</p>
<p>They saw that snap turned down a three billion dollar offer from facebook and now it&rsquo;s worth 80 billion</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going for the 100 billion dollar youtube 1.6 billion. Yeah, and now it&rsquo;s worth hundreds of billions</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re hoping it&rsquo;s going to be like that</p>
<p>Um, but chamath chamath is right</p>
<p>Look, if they had taken what say 20 percent of a four billion dollar outcome 800 million</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even pay back their fund, right?</p>
<p>But if it ends up being a hundred billion dollar outcome, they make 20 billion</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like a coinbase for them. What do you think they gave to the founders?</p>
<p>Well, who knows keep them in the game because four billion if they owned 80 percent</p>
<p>Yeah, they took out they took chips off the table</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing all those decisions were made before the recent collapse and engagement at clubhouse</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure anybody would be paying four billion for it now</p>
<p>Given everything that&rsquo;s gone wrong, but you know, who knows it&rsquo;s still pretty early</p>
<p>just for people who are curious, there is a twitter handle all in underscore stats and</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all in stats.com. I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;re not affiliated with these maniacs, but um</p>
<p>We we love the stands and we&rsquo;re going to do something in person in september</p>
<p>Congratulations to the stands for losing their minds. I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good</p>
<p>Uh way for them to capture a bunch of attention on the twitter. All right</p>
<p>crypto is getting absolutely hammered, uh, and I it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the chinese have once again said</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re basically saber rattling about cryptocurrency. They&rsquo;re obviously going to do their own. Um,</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>I think you have to talk about china in a</p>
<p>in a slightly broader lens than just what&rsquo;s happening in crypto because like this is the same week where</p>
<p>They basically they&rsquo;ve they forced, you know, zhang yiming to resign from</p>
<p>Byte dance. I mean, you know last last week it was or last month</p>
<p>It was the ceo pin duo duo and jack ma&rsquo;s mia. They&rsquo;re going for the jugular</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re what why are they taking out all their top ceos?</p>
<p>This would be like putting ilan and jeff bezos on the bench. What is it? They just don&rsquo;t want any heroes</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I guess maybe the speculative part in me would say</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re showing them who&rsquo;s really in charge of these companies</p>
<p>I mean it would be crazy to your point if the government of the united states</p>
<p>Forced sundar pichai and tim cook and mark zuckerberg and elon musk to resign. It&rsquo;s like hey, sorry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, sorry, you need to leave right now and put somebody else in and deactivate their badges</p>
<p>Yeah, we just we just relentlessly criticize them, right? But but yeah, we just demonize them</p>
<p>We just try to cancel them</p>
<p>but look</p>
<p>But they deserve that level of scrutiny because the amount of power they have but but yeah that we don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Put them in jail or house arrest or drive them out of their companies and that is a big advantage for the us economy</p>
<p>The treasury department here in the united states is doing a little saber rattling. They want to know</p>
<p>Anytime there is a ten thousand dollar transaction in any kind of digital token</p>
<p>And uh, they&rsquo;re talking about a cbdc</p>
<p>To do their own cryptocurrency. So they&rsquo;re putting out a white paper for feedback this summer</p>
<p>um, and uh</p>
<p>We are now seeing a pullback on bitcoin from you know, uh, mid 60s to uh, you know now into the 36 37</p>
<p>Thousand per bitcoin. Do you think this is the end of the beginning beginning of the end?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the beginning david rubinstein was on cnbc</p>
<p>Today and david rubinstein for those you guys don&rsquo;t know is um was a co-founder of carlisle group</p>
<p>You know more blue chip and blue blooded you cannot get</p>
<p>And very connected in washington and you know, he said it best where he said, you know effectively</p>
<p>People want this and the government will</p>
<p>Uh have no choice except to support it because you can&rsquo;t take something like this with this much institutional</p>
<p>and retail demand away</p>
<p>so we have to go to the place where</p>
<p>Now crypto needs to be like everything else and maybe the crypto stands get upset with that because they don&rsquo;t like it that</p>
<p>You know a bunch of their parents are all of a sudden going to be buying tokens and stuff</p>
<p>But they got to get over it. Um, then this stuff should be, you know transacted in the same way</p>
<p>You transact anything else you buy it you sell it you get a tax return you pay your taxes and you move on</p>
<p>this reminds me of the transition that we all went through with I don&rsquo;t know if you remember kazaa and napster and</p>
<p>Bit torrent like everybody all the we a lot of our contemporaries in their 30s, you know, whatever 10 20 years ago</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like you can&rsquo;t stop it. You can&rsquo;t stop it and it got stopped</p>
<p>you know like you made it illegal and you prosecuted people and then you came up with solutions that were regulated like spotify or</p>
<p>You know netflix and you gave the consumers what they wanted. So</p>
<p>David, do you think this is a similar path right now that we&rsquo;re going through which is</p>
<p>The crypto zealots and the and the and the stands are gonna</p>
<p>basically have to</p>
<p>Get used to as chamat saying their parents buying it and crypto not being this underground thing</p>
<p>But being regulated in in a major way in the united states and is that a good or bad thing?</p>
<p>I I think the thing that that&rsquo;s happening quietly behind the scenes is that major wall street players</p>
<p>institutions endowments and so forth</p>
<p>Over the past year have decided that bitcoin and crypto is a legitimate asset class and they&rsquo;ve been allocating to it</p>
<p>Huge huge pools of capital balance sheet capital have been allocating into it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s gonna change. This is probably a pretty good buying opportunity. We&rsquo;ve seen these</p>
<p>crashes and bitcoin many many times over the years</p>
<p>It plummets down and then it goes back up and it eventually goes back up reaches a new peak</p>
<p>So this is probably a pretty good entry point for the next rally</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know when that&rsquo;s going to be but the whole point of bitcoin is that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s censorship resistant</p>
<p>And china can do its best to try and stamp it out, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be successful at that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re so wrong about that</p>
<p>That is the most naive take worst take you&rsquo;ve ever had. How&rsquo;s china going to stop bitcoin?</p>
<p>Uh, how do they stop vpns? They put people in jail. How do they stop religion?</p>
<p>They put people in jail</p>
<p>They may make it incredibly hard for chinese citizens to get a hold of bitcoin</p>
<p>I agree with that, but they&rsquo;re not going to be able to stop bitcoin</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to stop bitcoin in the west, but they will stop it in china</p>
<p>They 100 will stop and you know how many servers are in china</p>
<p>I mean go talk to the people who were in tiananmen square about what miners will have to move out the miners</p>
<p>Miners are done. And then if it&rsquo;ll be an underground thing, it&rsquo;ll be like having a vpn</p>
<p>Which is five years in jail for selling vpns</p>
<p>What do you think about the irs requirement that you have to report any bitcoin transaction over ten thousand dollars?</p>
<p>Do you think that that and americans can be prosecuted for not reporting, right? So I don&rsquo;t know how much that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Fine, so what do it? So let&rsquo;s get over it</p>
<p>20 of the transactions that might have been this is this is the silk road fallacy that you know that the only</p>
<p>Legitimate use for crypto or I said 20. I didn&rsquo;t say okay fine</p>
<p>But so maybe that makes that that small fraction of illegitimate or illicit use cases</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p>No, sex. I think the point is um that they&rsquo;re trying to chase down. It&rsquo;s not about illegal use cases</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about not reporting a taxable gain on your bitcoin before you use that money to buy something</p>
<p>So sure, of course about tax evasion, but look</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not going to stop bitcoin usage. Um, you know</p>
<p>Smart people who&rsquo;ve been trading bitcoin been paying taxes on it for years</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really an issue</p>
<p>If you were in china and you had created your wealth in china or many many other countries all over the world and there were</p>
<p>currency restrictions and controls and the government was asserting more and more power and were putting</p>
<p>Business leaders under house arrest and and seeking to put them under their thumb</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be trying to convert as much of your net worth into bitcoin as possible</p>
<p>So that all you have to do is if you ever had to flee the country</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have to have dollars in your suitcase or gold bricks or diamonds</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d simply have to have a password in your brain</p>
<p>That you could access at any computer terminal when you got out of the country</p>
<p>And so that I think that sort of digital gold</p>
<p>Is a phenomenal use case of bitcoin and the more oppressive</p>
<p>All these countries become the more they increase the value of that use case</p>
<p>What do you think is the black swan event in crypto in bitcoin in particular?</p>
<p>Taxation in the united states a 10</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an additional taxation like you do on</p>
<p>Cigarettes, that would be for me the united states putting a tax on it. That makes it less competitive with our our national</p>
<p>Coming cryptocurrency the cbdc that the united states will launch in the next two or three years</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say if you want to use any of these other currencies</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 10 tax on them. We want you using ours the legitimate one</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a very negative black swan</p>
<p>That obviously has never occurred. Um, but if anyone ever manages to counterfeit a bitcoin</p>
<p>Or this is the double spend problem, right?</p>
<p>If you could ever if you could ever double spend or or figure out a way to create bitcoins</p>
<p>Or counterfeit them whatever that weren&rsquo;t in the blockchain if the number of bitcoins ever grew beyond the 21 million</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just built into the way that the whole thing works if that ever happened bitcoin is instantly worthless</p>
<p>That would be the black swan on the negative side</p>
<p>If it didn&rsquo;t happen in the first 11 years, what do you think the like on a percentage basis that it happens in the 20th?</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s too expensive now and it&rsquo;s too it&rsquo;s too visible like the the way that it would have happened</p>
<p>It would have happened in the first two or three years or the argument could be maybe opposite that now it&rsquo;s so valuable</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s worth investing to figure out a target. Yeah. Yeah, and and and it&rsquo;s and and rather than have it be about a diminishing probability</p>
<p>It could be an increasing probability over time</p>
<p>Which is that the pathways to get there start to get resolved whereas in the past you didn&rsquo;t have enough time to resolve those pathways</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m speaking highly theoretical here. But like certainly</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t take into account that it&rsquo;s open source and that everybody can see it. So</p>
<p>You would think that everybody would discover the vulnerability at the same time right in an open source project</p>
<p>Well, no, I think the I think the issue practically speaking in this would be</p>
<p>Is that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for a lot of potential for a lot of potential</p>
<p>Well, no, I think the I think the issue practically speaking in this would be that you would see there&rsquo;s resources getting organized meaning</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d see silicon being bought in volume by some centralized player</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d have to see water and power come together as well</p>
<p>and this is where I think it&rsquo;s just not realistic where</p>
<p>Today that I think the horse has left the barn because if you try to basically capture</p>
<p>Enough hash rate to kind of like overpower this network</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like the scene in austin powers where he&rsquo;s screaming in front of a</p>
<p>A steamroller, but the steamroller is moving at like one foot a minute, right?</p>
<p>You see it coming. It&rsquo;s just like you just see it coming</p>
<p>Well, would you have a black swan friedberg? You asked a lot of questions. So do you have one?</p>
<p>I think about it a lot. I don&rsquo;t really I mean, it&rsquo;s a black swan. It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a black swan</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t really see it coming but like</p>
<p>You know the the thing about bitcoin</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Which has always given me pause</p>
<p>Is the fact that</p>
<p>The only way it works is if everyone believes that more people are going to believe in it tomorrow than believe in it today</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the only way it appreciates</p>
<p>yeah, but the</p>
<p>for for a variety of reasons, it&rsquo;s also the only way that it works because</p>
<p>Um, if it starts to depreciate it becomes almost like this unwinding</p>
<p>Circumstance and there are moments where it unwinds, but then people kind of say well, you know what more people are going to get on this</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the chinese argument. There&rsquo;s the argentinian argument. There&rsquo;s all the reasons why people will try and store wealth in this system</p>
<p>And that becomes a rationale for continuing to bet on it</p>
<p>And my observation is so many people that are active in bitcoin</p>
<p>Compare bitcoin to the price of the dollar which to me seems like it doesn&rsquo;t make sense relative to the intention of bitcoin</p>
<p>Which is to not be part of the monetary system that uses the dollar as kind of a de facto, you know</p>
<p>system of value</p>
<p>And so why have the comparison to the dollar as the objective for bitcoin?</p>
<p>Why is the objective not transactions use cases number of people that are active on the network, etc, etc</p>
<p>And nobody buying it is buying it as a substitute for dollars. They&rsquo;re buying it as a lottery ticket</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>And so then it becomes this rationale that it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s an investment that you put money in</p>
<p>in the form of dollars or your local currency</p>
<p>With the intention that you will be able to get more of your local currency out at some point in the future</p>
<p>And the only way that works is if you expect someone else will buy it from you at a higher price in the future</p>
<p>Therefore it&rsquo;s all about propagating the uh, you know the marketing around the bitcoin</p>
<p>Whereas if your objective was really about making this become a replacement currency system or replacement monetary</p>
<p>system you would ultimately</p>
<p>Care less about you know, what&rsquo;s the dollar value per coin and you would care more about how many people are using it</p>
<p>You know how active let me build on that question</p>
<p>so sax or chamath if</p>
<p>the cbdc</p>
<p>And american&rsquo;s currency, you know starts to move towards a bitcoin blockchain like experience</p>
<p>What would america start to look like if 10 or 20 percent of your dollars?</p>
<p>Instead of being held in a bank. We&rsquo;re on a blockchain with an american a government a government-backed blockchain</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. It&rsquo;s still that people are it&rsquo;s centralized and not only is it centralized but also</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still prone to debasement, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so look human beings have used everything from gold coins to seashells as money</p>
<p>We can make anything money that&rsquo;s easy to transact if we all agree on it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense in which bitcoin is the bubble that becomes true if everyone believes in it provided</p>
<p>Provided the number of bitcoins stay at 21 million and that the technology</p>
<p>Enforces the scarcity the problem we have with the u.s</p>
<p>Dollar is the government can just print as many of them as they want. Yeah, you change the denominator problem. Yeah, and</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a positive black swan as well for positive for bitcoin</p>
<p>Which is stanley druckenmiller thinks in the next 15 years the u.s dollar would no longer be the world&rsquo;s reserve currency</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s going to replace it the positive black swan would be that bitcoin becomes</p>
<p>If not the a world reserve currency an unofficial world reserve currency</p>
<p>Why because people trust it?</p>
<p>They trust the decentralization more than they trust any government</p>
<p>And that would that would be a big is that in?</p>
<p>Is the united states and china are they going to let bitcoin become the world&rsquo;s reserve currency?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a choice that they have you sure so yeah</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing they can do</p>
<p>What about the law and guns and jail and tax?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s nothing that they could there was nothing that they could do to stop it before there&rsquo;s nothing that they can do to</p>
<p>Stop it now</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t get the new york times in china and you can&rsquo;t practice religion there</p>
<p>So they have a pretty easy system. They put you in jail. They want to stop bitcoin. They could just put you in jail</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>Finding out that you have bitcoin and just well because they have a hundred percent</p>
<p>Uh view into the internet there they have how on because they have routers</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they capture all the uyghurs is they know their location?</p>
<p>Because they have mobile phones and when they use signal or any other encrypted technology they catch them</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how they catch all the dissidents there is they they have them and they also have apple&rsquo;s entire</p>
<p>Data center is controlled by the chinese government</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ledger somewhere that says this specific wallet address equals david sacks and there&rsquo;s not going to be one anytime</p>
<p>soon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll have these centralized wallet authorities that actually, you know have a lot of account information</p>
<p>But the reality is the sophisticated actors, you know</p>
<p>Use tumblers they they they wash sort of like their</p>
<p>Their paths in a way where it&rsquo;s very difficult to figure out who these people are now</p>
<p>If you if you don&rsquo;t if you use a site that doesn&rsquo;t have kyc that&rsquo;s always going to be the case and you know</p>
<p>People with huge amounts of bitcoin are sophisticated enough to know how to stay anonymous if they want to</p>
<p>For everybody else who doesn&rsquo;t care because for them it&rsquo;s sort of an investment asset class and an you know a hedge</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re not going to care either and the point is when enough people own it</p>
<p>Governments aren&rsquo;t in a position to track record of them. Just waking up one day and pulling the plug on anything is zero</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how people do things</p>
<p>You have to have like centralized policy and support</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see it one way or the other of all the things that china and the united states will face over the next</p>
<p>30 or 40 years</p>
<p>This is like 50th on the list</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think?</p>
<p>Any closing thoughts?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;ve said it. Um</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean look I think I think if you&rsquo;re going to stay in a place like the united states</p>
<p>You need to comply with tax law. You&rsquo;re absolutely going to report your bitcoin holdings if it&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>But if the reason you&rsquo;re buying bitcoin is because you&rsquo;re fleeing a country</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re worried about fleeing a country. You&rsquo;re obviously not going to report it and that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the advantage of it</p>
<p>Is that it&rsquo;s a portable?</p>
<p>money supply</p>
<p>That again, you can just um, you don&rsquo;t have to carry anything with you</p>
<p>You just put a password in your brain wallet. Tell me about ufos before we leave</p>
<p>I mean, can you believe this thing? This is the craziest thing. I I so there was a yeah</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 60 minutes episode that just happened deputy assistant</p>
<p>Secretary of defense for intelligence literally said the crafts we&rsquo;re seeing are and then in quotes far beyond</p>
<p>Anything that we&rsquo;re capable of there&rsquo;s nothing we could build</p>
<p>That would be strong enough to endure the amount of force and acceleration imagine a technology that can do 700 g-forces flight 13 miles</p>
<p>per hour evade radar</p>
<p>And has every no obvious signs of propulsion and yet can clearly defy the effects of earth&rsquo;s gravity</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s precisely what we&rsquo;re seeing from the director of advanced aerospace threat identification program</p>
<p>I mean, is this real like how is what what do we do? What?</p>
<p>Our government says there are crafts that outstrip our arsenal by at least 100 years to 1000 years at the moment and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Meh, what do you think friedberg? You&rsquo;re the scientist here. There&rsquo;s a if you read the original</p>
<p>uh treatment written by arthur clark for the movie 2001 a space odyssey</p>
<p>Which was written before the movie and then the book was written after the movie</p>
<p>He makes a really compelling point</p>
<p>and the point he makes is that</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>civilizations achieve</p>
<p>a sophisticated enough level of technology</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no longer a need to physically transport yourself from star to star and transport yourself around the universe think about this for a second</p>
<p>Take what we have from virtual reality today and fast forward 200 years</p>
<p>And then take what we have in terms of you know</p>
<p>The ability to print and create anything we want on demand and fast forward two or three hundred years</p>
<p>Those two conditions alone</p>
<p>Might give us the ability to strap on something to our brain</p>
<p>And literally and remember our brain is simply sensing what our body is given</p>
<p>And if you can control what your brain is sensing through some strap-on device or whatever</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need to physically be in the place where that happens</p>
<p>So if we can remotely sense what&rsquo;s going on somewhere else in the universe or some other part of our planet</p>
<p>And we can remotely pick up those signals and view them or experience them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to physically be there and then secondly all this sorry all this via strap-on, okay</p>
<p>Yeah, and then secondly, I shouldn&rsquo;t use it. I shouldn&rsquo;t use the term and then secondly if you could print it</p>
<p>Yeah, but think about if you guys ever watch the tv show star trek next generation</p>
<p>Which I would guess maybe one of the replicator</p>
<p>Or the replicator or the holodeck and you could walk in number three on my list of star trek</p>
<p>Yeah, seriously if you walk in and you could literally recreate the physical space that you want to be in to accomplish anything</p>
<p>The holodeck and then you could print anything</p>
<p>Why would you use all the energy and all of this work to transport physical matter?</p>
<p>From one part of the universe to the other when all matter is transmutable</p>
<p>And the only thing that differentiates things is the photons coming off that matter, which is just to sense it</p>
<p>So if you can sense things remotely</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re physically here, why go through the trouble why go through the trouble?</p>
<p>And so the argument the same reason that we go to hawaii and not just watch a movie</p>
<p>No, because we don&rsquo;t have enough of the sensing capabilities today to truly recreate being in hawaii</p>
<p>But imagine if we did and and we are very much on the path to doing that and in two 300 years</p>
<p>We have the ability to physically recreate what it&rsquo;s like for our body to be in hawaii in every form smell taste color</p>
<p>Everything about being there physically and our body experiences it. Why the hell would you fly to hawaii?</p>
<p>You could meet people you could socialize</p>
<p>So in a world short in a world where that technology exists, which could by the way be neural link, right?</p>
<p>Where you can, you know, put these signals directly into the brain, etc</p>
<p>Moving physical matter from one part of the universe to the other makes zero sense</p>
<p>All matter is transmutable. You can convert one atom to another using a technology locally</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the premise of 2001 is that you&rsquo;ve got these local communication pods that just transmit information from different parts of the universe</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to physically transport yourself</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the the macro kind of argument against this notion that ufos or aliens are in a physical spacecraft visiting</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so old school technology that it makes no sense</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, you know, oh my gosh</p>
<p>All these people are coming over to the united states on horses from europe, you know</p>
<p>Like it just like why would they do that? Why would they use a horse?</p>
<p>Uh, so so I think that&rsquo;s the argument against</p>
<p>Ufos being aliens and spacecraft now, is there a really cool technology that has this advanced capability and they&rsquo;re these crafts</p>
<p>That are in our sky and someone has that technology maybe</p>
<p>Um, but i&rsquo;m not sure about this</p>
<p>General pieces, I mean you blew my mind with that. So yeah sax, uh, I you obviously don&rsquo;t care so</p>
<p>I have no way for this to increase the irr of my fund or to get me another home</p>
<p>On planet earth. Why would I want to go?</p>
<p>I just somehow feel like if they&rsquo;re really ufos it&rsquo;d be like an even bigger story like we&rsquo;d all know it</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not going to be some like weird fringe conspiracy thing. Here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>I do not care about emotions of humans. I can tell you why I care about the emotions of others every single</p>
<p>Photograph that&rsquo;s been taken in the last year is</p>
<p>Absolutely recognizably better than the one taken 10 years ago</p>
<p>And every single photo or video of these aliens looks like it was shot in a on a camera from 1950</p>
<p>On film that was left in somebody&rsquo;s basement</p>
<p>And meanwhile pick meanwhile pixar movies can recreate literally the ocean</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re recording this on zoom. Why can&rsquo;t a jet get me a clear shot?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one clear shot of this show me the alien in 4k high def and then i&rsquo;ll believe it</p>
<p>You ever see a spacex launch where it has a camera by the engine and we can see the engine like why can&rsquo;t we get?</p>
<p>a shot of the</p>
<p>Until then I will be traveling between my homes living my best life. I am living my best life not in san francisco</p>
<p>We will get chesa budin recalled I will tell you sax</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to harp on the chesa point anymore because I don&rsquo;t hear anyone making the case on the other side anymore</p>
<p>Dustin moskowitz</p>
<p>Yes, what from asana, yes, nick pull up the tweet so, you know, I&rsquo;ve been basically because look there we fired him up</p>
<p>Here we go. No, let me get this</p>
<p>Insert corner here</p>
<p>Run</p>
<p>Run rage function now</p>
<p>No, look we&rsquo;re taking all this heat from these stupid reporters are talking about our donations</p>
<p>You know like asking what are we up to look?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very public about what we&rsquo;re up to but this is a terrible tweet from dustin there</p>
<p>There have been these tech billionaires dustin moskowitz reed hastings and mike krieger</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been donating money</p>
<p>To what to chesa budin and gascona. That&rsquo;s disappointing</p>
<p>Yeah, horrible. So I asked I just said why are you donating money this insanity and dustin&rsquo;s still defending it?</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Said i&rsquo;m gonna mute you now because you know, you didn&rsquo;t want to you didn&rsquo;t want to wait just in fairness</p>
<p>Let me pull this up</p>
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s quote is I live in the city and i&rsquo;m not going anywhere crime happens to me, too</p>
<p>Trust me. We write extensively about why are of our grants here? You know, here&rsquo;s the thing. I think dustin reed hastings</p>
<p>um and</p>
<p>Their spouses are very involved in criminal justice reform</p>
<p>and what we have to do is give somebody like dustin or reed hastings the benefit of the doubt here and say</p>
<p>We understand your donations</p>
<p>were meaningful to you and you wanted to</p>
<p>um, maybe lower the incarceration of black people in jail for</p>
<p>Crimes that were not violent and we agree</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s no this conversation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not giving them the benefit of the doubt. Let me explain why okay</p>
<p>So reed so this is a good example. This reed hastings thing is a good example</p>
<p>By the way, just today it was announced that he donated three million to gavin newsom</p>
<p>um in any event, so</p>
<p>You know, he keep he look he&rsquo;s on that side of the spectrum, by the way</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little backstory there. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember when there was pressure</p>
<p>Uh on the facebook board to kick peter teal off back in 2016</p>
<p>It was reed. That was from reed. That was from reed hastings. Okay, so the guy is very close-minded</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s his wife is actually handling this</p>
<p>He was the board member who pushed to get peter off because he couldn&rsquo;t handle the fact</p>
<p>That there might be another board member who had disagree with him politically</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very close-minded point of view, but let&rsquo;s take let&rsquo;s take this example of crime in la. Okay, so we had this</p>
<p>election</p>
<p>Where george gascon who was a failure as da in san francisco?</p>
<p>He goes down to la and runs against the the veteran da down there. Jackie. Lacey who</p>
<p>It happens to be a black woman a veteran season da</p>
<p>Competent nobody had a problem with her. I think she&rsquo;s a democrat. Okay. It&rsquo;s not like this is a right-wing person</p>
<p>And so george gascon basically fails his way out of san francisco goes down to la and he basically</p>
<p>Um dislodges her from that seat with 15 million dollars an unprecedented amount spent a da election</p>
<p>Where did that money come from 5 million came from source 5 million came for reed hastings</p>
<p>5 million came from blm now</p>
<p>You know in any other context the idea that you&rsquo;re going to fire</p>
<p>a talented competent seasoned veteran black woman and replace her with</p>
<p>An incompetent white male that would be seen as institutional racism, but nobody complained about it at all</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s outrageous. Yeah, what is there? What is the most charitable was behind that? What is the most charitable?</p>
<p>View of why they&rsquo;re supporting</p>
<p>Gascogne and chesa well, there&rsquo;s this decarcerationist agenda. And so yes, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re right that they see</p>
<p>Mass incarceration is a problem, but the problem is it is but the solution is not mass decarceration</p>
<p>That we need something in between and the problem with gascogne and chesa boudin</p>
<p>They just want to let everybody out. They don&rsquo;t want to they also don&rsquo;t want to add anybody</p>
<p>So I think if their agenda is to lower the number adding people is against that</p>
<p>There are people who need to go to jail murderers need to go to jail people dying every day</p>
<p>in san francisco</p>
<p>uh by at the hands of repeat offenders</p>
<p>Who chesa boudin has made the decision to let them out of jail, even though they should be in jail</p>
<p>These are dangerous violent felons</p>
<p>the problem with this is I think chamath I would like to get your feedback on it is you know you</p>
<p>When a person gives these kind of donations and they make it their public persona</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t go well</p>
<p>How does one?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know disentangle or</p>
<p>Reconcile they made a bet</p>
<p>That had a bad outcome because this is obviously a bad outcome. You don&rsquo;t want the city to</p>
<p>devolve into chaos</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly care about san francisco and I think I think the two</p>
<p>The two of you guys can talk about it on. No, i&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get rid of my place in the city on colin, but I I could I couldn&rsquo;t care less about how that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I got nothing to say</p>
<p>Okay, I want to add this one thing. Look I so I care because I live there</p>
<p>But but this trend this is not just san francisco this whole idea of these radical</p>
<p>Decarcerationists, they are running for da in every major city. This is going to be a national trend</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to cause a lot of</p>
<p>Carnage a lot of death and destruction until the people realize</p>
<p>And there will inevitably be a backlash to this and hopefully just not too many people</p>
<p>Fair enough. I I don&rsquo;t want to be too flippant. My point is it&rsquo;s a really important debate</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen in every city</p>
<p>But folks need to get engaged in those cities and do something about it</p>
<p>If you want to hear the argument of why this is happening</p>
<p>You can go watch the ted talk on youtube of adam foss f-o-s-s. He was the original like</p>
<p>Proponent of the da&rsquo;s coming in to drive the decarceration</p>
<p>decarceration movements</p>
<p>Um, and you know, I just think it&rsquo;s important to be informed of the other perspective</p>
<p>Uh in evaluating where folks are coming from that are that are proponents for this movement</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;m trying to be charitable towards their position dustin and reed if you want to come on the pod and be a bestie guestie</p>
<p>I guess maybe doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t respond to me and said listen</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the counterfactual is if we had a more aggressive da that was his arguments</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the counterfactual. So I of course so I posted a list of people of innocent victims who&rsquo;ve died</p>
<p>Okay, because directly because</p>
<p>Of a decision that chase abudin made that&rsquo;s your counterfactual</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s your counterfactual</p>
<p>All right. Listen, it&rsquo;s been an amazing episode and uh,</p>
<p>No plugs, no ads. No nothing if you like the show great</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like it, how the hell did you make it to the minute 75?</p>
<p>for the queen of quinoa</p>

<p>Run over I just can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make it it&rsquo;s hard to make good investments it&rsquo;s hard to build a company</p>
<p>Because if it was easy, everybody would be doing it all the time</p>
<p>This one man for yourself, it&rsquo;s all about you you can figure it out</p>
<p>with the rugged individualism, that&rsquo;s just not realistic like</p>

<p>Okay, melt a stick of butter in the microwave stick of butter in the microwave drink it and then basically take it</p>
<p>1500 light it on fire</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make it it&rsquo;s hard to make good investments it&rsquo;s hard to build a company</p>
<p>Because if it was easy, everybody would be doing it all the time</p>
<p>This one man for yourself, it&rsquo;s all about you you can figure it out</p>
<p>with the rugged individualism, that&rsquo;s just not realistic like</p>
