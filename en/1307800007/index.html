    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>In the last episode, we began to look at some of the specific words used by the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans, many of which are still found in various forms in modern English.</p>
<p>In this episode, I want to continue looking at some of the original Indo-European words.</p>
<p>Many of the words in this episode relate to the society and culture of the Indo-Europeans,</p>
<p>so these words will begin to reveal more about who these people were.</p>
<p>Remember that as linguists began to reconstruct these words, they were not really sure who</p>
<p>these people were.</p>
<p>They had some guesses and made certain assumptions, but they didn&rsquo;t really know when or where</p>
<p>these people lived.</p>
<p>So the language helps to narrow the range of possibilities.</p>
<p>In the last episode, I pointed out a few clues, like the existence of honeybees and beech</p>
<p>trees, and we&rsquo;ll look at all of these clues in an upcoming episode of the podcast.</p>
<p>But for now, let&rsquo;s look at some more words which the Indo-Europeans used to learn a bit</p>
<p>more about these ancient people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some of the kinship and family terms.</p>
<p>The Indo-European language contained the original version of the words father and mother.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the word father quite a few times in this podcast.</p>
<p>Remember that the word in Latin was pater, and the word in Old English was vater.</p>
<p>Both words originated in the original Indo-European language, as did the word for mother.</p>
<p>We also find the original version of the words brother and sister, which were pronounced</p>
<p>something like brater and sweser.</p>
<p>So these words haven&rsquo;t changed very much in Modern English.</p>
<p>And speaking of brother and sister, we also find the root of the word sibling.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European root produced the Old English word sib, meaning kinsman in a</p>
<p>more generic sense.</p>
<p>And the Old English word sib later produced sibling in Modern English, meaning a brother</p>
<p>or sister specifically.</p>
<p>Sib is also the original suffix of the word gossip, which was godsib originally, meaning</p>
<p>the offspring of one&rsquo;s godmother or godfather.</p>
<p>A godsib was someone who was like an immediate family member, but wasn&rsquo;t actually related,</p>
<p>and thus someone with whom you might share secrets about others.</p>
<p>Thus the word gossip.</p>
<p>The same Indo-European root word also produced the word self, and even the sui in suicide.</p>
<p>We also find the original version of the word nephew, but in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language the term was nepat, and it meant any male descendant other than a son.</p>
<p>So it was a very general term which included a grandson, a stepson, as well as a sibling</p>
<p>son in the sense that it&rsquo;s used today.</p>
<p>And it continued to be used in this general sense in both Old English and Middle English</p>
<p>before the English word nepha died out.</p>
<p>As has happened with so many Modern English words, the Modern English word nephew comes</p>
<p>from the same original Indo-European word, but it comes in through French and ultimately</p>
<p>through Latin.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word nepat evolved into nepatem in Latin, where it was also used</p>
<p>in the same general sense of a male descendant other than a son.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s from this same Latin word used in this general sense that we get the Modern</p>
<p>English word nepatism.</p>
<p>But the word found its way into French and eventually into English after the Norman invasion</p>
<p>in a male and female form.</p>
<p>The male form eventually becoming anglicized as nephew, and the female form came from French</p>
<p>as niece in almost the same form which we have today.</p>
<p>But again, both niece and nephew were used in a more general sense in Middle English.</p>
<p>Niece could refer to a granddaughter, and nephew could refer to a grandson.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1600s that the terms became restricted to their current meanings as a</p>
<p>sibling&rsquo;s daughter or son.</p>
<p>But also note one other somewhat subtle point.</p>
<p>The words niece and nephew come from an original Indo-European word meaning a male descendant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reconstructed Indo-European word for a female descendant in this same sense.</p>
<p>And in fact, linguists have noted this fact about the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>There are lots of roots for male kin terms, but much fewer for female terms.</p>
<p>In the same sense that there was a word which meant male descendants other than a son, there</p>
<p>was also a word which meant adult male relatives or ancestors other than a father.</p>
<p>This word could refer to a grandfather, or an uncle, or other adult male relative.</p>
<p>This word has been reconstructed as something like awo.</p>
<p>This original word found its way into both the Germanic languages and Latin, and very</p>
<p>early on, its meaning came to be limited to a parent&rsquo;s brother in both language families.</p>
<p>The Old English version of the word has died out, but the Latin version was borrowed into</p>
<p>English from French after the Norman invasion as uncle, which eventually became the word</p>
<p>uncle.</p>
<p>But again, the term aunt or aunt doesn&rsquo;t have any known Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>So we have this phenomenon where terms related to male kin survive in nearly all Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>But similar terms for the wife or wife&rsquo;s family are rare, and they&rsquo;re variable in</p>
<p>Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>This has led linguists and language historians to conclude that Indo-European speakers inherited</p>
<p>their possessions, their rights, and their duties from their father&rsquo;s bloodline.</p>
<p>In these kinship terms, when viewed in the way they were originally used, they suggest</p>
<p>that brides lived with their husband&rsquo;s family after marriage.</p>
<p>So in short, the original Indo-Europeans were probably a patriarchal society, where male</p>
<p>authority and male bloodlines controlled.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s look at some religious terms.</p>
<p>As you may recall from an earlier episode, the Indo-Europeans had a word for God, which</p>
<p>was a combination of sky and father.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, it was dauspita.</p>
<p>In Latin, it was Jupiter, which later became Jupiter.</p>
<p>In Greek, it was zeuspater, which was later shortened to just Zeus.</p>
<p>So all of these terms were connected and originally meant sky-father in the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Historians have concluded from the use of sky-father that the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>believed in a male sky-god.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s turn our attention to the political structure of these people.</p>
<p>What kind of political structure did they have?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a reconstructed Indo-European word, which means tribal or clan chieftain.</p>
<p>So historians have concluded from this that they were organized into small groups or clans</p>
<p>rather than large, more organized kingdoms.</p>
<p>In an upcoming episode, we&rsquo;re going to put all these pieces together and try to determine</p>
<p>exactly who these original Indo-Europeans were.</p>
<p>And based on this evidence, given the time and location where these people would have</p>
<p>lived, the archaeological evidence provides more information about these people.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, the evidence reveals that these people adopted a herding economy based</p>
<p>around cattle, sheep, and goats around 5200 BC.</p>
<p>And the burial evidence indicates the first appearance of tribal chiefs or village chiefs</p>
<p>a short time later based upon burial customs and artifacts which have been uncovered at</p>
<p>burial sites.</p>
<p>So we start to see a convergence of linguistic evidence and archaeological evidence as we</p>
<p>put these pieces together.</p>
<p>But again, more on all of this in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>Now the burial evidence also reveals that a few burials were more lavish than those</p>
<p>of the typical tribal chief.</p>
<p>This suggests a more prominent leader existed as well.</p>
<p>And as we look at the words of the original Indo-Europeans, we find a word which has been</p>
<p>reconstructed as reik, which meant to lead or set things straight.</p>
<p>This word also apparently referred to another kind of powerful leader or officer other than</p>
<p>a tribal chief.</p>
<p>And we know this in part because the same original Indo-European word, reik, can be</p>
<p>found in lots of words in modern English as well as other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the root of words like regulate and regulator, which reflect the original meaning</p>
<p>of the word in the sense of setting things right or one who sets things right.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s the root of the word right as well.</p>
<p>We also find it in the word correct, where it&rsquo;s reflected in the rekt part, and again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used in the sense of setting things right.</p>
<p>So we have regulate, right, and correct.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting is the appearance of this same root in many words for kings</p>
<p>and other prominent leaders in modern English and other Indo-European languages as well.</p>
<p>So for example, in Latin, we have the word rex, which meant king in Latin.</p>
<p>And we see that word occasionally in English.</p>
<p>We even see it in the word t-rex for a dinosaur, meaning literally king of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the word rix, which meant king in Celtic, and raj, which was king</p>
<p>in the Old Indic language in India.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the word regal and royal in modern English, both of those terms coming</p>
<p>from French and ultimately from Latin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the root of the word reich in German, as in the Third Reich.</p>
<p>So the connection of this root word, meaning to regulate or set things right, with the</p>
<p>many words we have for kings or royalty, suggest that there was a prominent leader whose job</p>
<p>was to regulate certain matters or set things right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention to certain terms that the Indo-Europeans had to reflect relationships,</p>
<p>specifically relationships between people.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s break down the Indo-European society a bit more, down to this personal level, to</p>
<p>see how Indo-Europeans interacted with each other.</p>
<p>In modern English, we have the words donate and give.</p>
<p>And in modern usage, we consider these words synonyms.</p>
<p>In other words, they mean basically the same thing.</p>
<p>Both of these words, give and donate, come from separate Indo-European root words.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root for donate produced words meaning to give in most dialects, but</p>
<p>it also produced a word meaning to take in the ancient Hittite language.</p>
<p>And the Indo-European root for give produced words meaning to give or donate in most dialects,</p>
<p>but it led to a word for take in Irish.</p>
<p>And there are other examples of this give-take phenomenon in other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>The same root words produced words meaning give in many dialects, but take in other dialects.</p>
<p>This suggests that the Indo-European people believed in reciprocal gift-giving.</p>
<p>The presentation of a gift required a counter-gift.</p>
<p>In other words, the acts of giving and receiving were part of a single process of exchange.</p>
<p>So the root word for this process passes on as give in some languages and take in other</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon occurs with the guest-host relationship.</p>
<p>In modern English, the words guest and host are two distinct roles.</p>
<p>The host owns or possesses a certain piece of property, and the guest is the person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>invited or welcomed by the host as a visitor.</p>
<p>But interestingly, both of these words, guest and host, derive from the same Indo-European</p>
<p>root word, which was ghosti.</p>
<p>Ghosti eventually produced the modern English word guest, and the G became silent in another</p>
<p>variation of the word and became host.</p>
<p>The fact that guest and host came from the same word suggests a specific set of cultural</p>
<p>rules in which guest-host relationships were intertwined.</p>
<p>There were mutual obligations of hospitality.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see in an upcoming episode, the original Indo-Europeans were a nomadic people</p>
<p>with a culture built around cattle raising as well as sheep, goat, and horse domestication.</p>
<p>They were always on the move, looking for new pastures and lands.</p>
<p>As a result, these tribes often came into contact with each other and passed through</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s territories.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s host might be tomorrow&rsquo;s guest.</p>
<p>So this word originally had a reciprocal or dual meaning.</p>
<p>But the guest was also a stranger, which meant that there was always a degree of uncertainty</p>
<p>and possible hostility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the original Indo-European word ghosti is also the root of the word hostile</p>
<p>in modern English.</p>
<p>And we also get the word ghost from this original word, a ghost being a form of a house guest.</p>
<p>And we also get the word hospital from this same root word.</p>
<p>And interestingly, the Latin noun hospice also meant both host and guest, so it was</p>
<p>a direct descendant of the original Indo-European word, and it carried the same dual meaning</p>
<p>that the original Indo-Europeans had.</p>
<p>According to the Romans, every hospice, meaning host or guest, should be friendly or hospitalis.</p>
<p>The term eventually became hospitum to mean a place where people were welcomed by a friendly</p>
<p>host in exchange for payment of a specific price.</p>
<p>This is the root of hospice, hospitality, and hotel.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, pilgrims from Europe began to travel to the Holy Land, and a military</p>
<p>order of monks established a place in Jerusalem to welcome and treat sick and injured pilgrims.</p>
<p>This order was called the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And this was the root of the use of the word hospital as a term to refer to a place for</p>
<p>treating sick people.</p>
<p>So from this single Indo-European word, we get guest, host, ghost, hostile, hospice,</p>
<p>hospitality, hotel, and hospital.</p>
<p>So if this word is the root of hostile because a guest or host could be unfriendly, what</p>
<p>about actual conflict between people or groups?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that the words for war in the original Indo-European languages</p>
<p>are not cognate with each other.</p>
<p>In other words, the word came into the respective languages later, and doesn&rsquo;t appear to be</p>
<p>in the original Indo-European vocabulary.</p>
<p>This indicates that the term is associated with long-term armed conflict between two</p>
<p>or more political units, or city-states, or nation-states.</p>
<p>But it did not exist during the Indo-European era.</p>
<p>Historians now know that raiding did occur between the various Indo-European clans or</p>
<p>tribes, and that it was actually quite common, even a ritual or rite of passage for certain</p>
<p>young men.</p>
<p>But this was not the same as war in the sense that we would later know it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn our attention to numbers, because all of our basic numbers come from the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 100, which we&rsquo;ve talked about quite a</p>
<p>bit in this podcast series.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s really interesting about these numbers is they suggest that the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans tended to count by tens, basically the same as we do today with the metric system.</p>
<p>So for example, the word hundred literally meant a sum of ten tens.</p>
<p>All modern English numbers are based on repeating increments of ten.</p>
<p>Ten tens in a hundred, ten hundreds in a thousand, etc.</p>
<p>And of course, even when we count basic numbers, we do so in tens.</p>
<p>So after twenty, we go to twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, all the way to twenty-nine,</p>
<p>and then start with a new set of ten, with thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, all the way</p>
<p>to thirty-nine, and so on.</p>
<p>The point here is that we still count in tens.</p>
<p>And when we look at the language of the original Indo-Europeans, we see that the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>also counted in tens.</p>
<p>And this may seem obvious today, but it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that not all ancient</p>
<p>cultures counted by tens.</p>
<p>Even today, we count by twelves for certain things.</p>
<p>A dozen eggs, twelve inches and a foot, twelve months and a year.</p>
<p>Each day is divided into two twelve-hour increments.</p>
<p>Even 360 degrees in a circle is based on increments of twelve.</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonians used a base system of sixty in counting, so we may get the tendency</p>
<p>to count certain measurements in increments of twelve, either directly or indirectly from</p>
<p>the Babylonians.</p>
<p>And I say may because, frankly, I haven&rsquo;t researched it thoroughly, and I can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that definitively.</p>
<p>But Indo-European cultures, like the ancient Greeks and Romans, used a base system of ten</p>
<p>just as we do today.</p>
<p>So some of our tendency to measure certain things in increments of ten come from these</p>
<p>Indo-European sources.</p>
<p>But the point here is how a small and seemingly unimportant fact, like the numbers used by</p>
<p>these ancient people, can have a significant impact on the way we do things and the way</p>
<p>we think about things today.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans also had words for colors.</p>
<p>And some of these words are the roots of the words we have today.</p>
<p>In modern English, we have the words black and white.</p>
<p>These colors may seem like polar opposites, but the original Indo-European word for black</p>
<p>is also the root of the word for white in many Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>Once again, just like with guest and host, we have one of those Indo-European root words</p>
<p>that produces two seemingly contradictory words.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word bell meant burn, flash, or shine.</p>
<p>As a result, it&rsquo;s the root of the word black, which refers to something burnt or blackened.</p>
<p>But that same original Indo-European word is also the root of the Latin word blancus,</p>
<p>which meant white, as in something bright which is in the process of burning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still found in many Latin-derived words for white, like the French word blanc</p>
<p>and the Spanish word blanco.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why those Latin-derived words for white resemble the English word for black.</p>
<p>Black, blanc, blanco.</p>
<p>But in English, black means black.</p>
<p>But French blanc and Spanish blanco both mean white.</p>
<p>The point here is that the French and Spanish versions of the words come from the same original</p>
<p>Indo-European root word, but they change to reflect the brightness produced by a fire</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s burning.</p>
<p>But English didn&rsquo;t borrow the same word for white.</p>
<p>The English word white comes from the Old English word huit, which comes from Old Germanic.</p>
<p>The Old English word derives from a different Indo-European root word, which was quintos,</p>
<p>but that word also meant bright in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So it was just a different word that the Indo-Europeans had, not the same root that we have for the</p>
<p>word black.</p>
<p>You might also note the similarity of the word white with the modern English word what.</p>
<p>Remember in the Gremslaw episode, I talked about the origin of the word what.</p>
<p>It was originally kwot in the original Indo-European language, and it became k in Spanish and</p>
<p>kuh in French.</p>
<p>In Old English, the k sound shifted to an h sound under Gremslaw, and it became what.</p>
<p>The h sound at the beginning was dropped over time, and we ended up with the modern English</p>
<p>word what.</p>
<p>The same thing happened with white.</p>
<p>It began as quintos in the original Indo-European language, and the k sound had shifted to an</p>
<p>h sound under Gremslaw in the Germanic languages, and it became quintos, and again the h sound</p>
<p>dropped off at the beginning, and the first two letters, h and w, were shifted to wh to</p>
<p>reflect that the w sound was the primary consonant at the beginning.</p>
<p>So white, what, when, all of these words went through the same general process, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why all of those words begin with a wh spelling, even though the h is basically silent today.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans also had a root word for the modern English word red, and this root</p>
<p>word is found throughout the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>The English word red is cognate with the French word rouge and the Spanish word rojo.</p>
<p>It also appears in the modern English word rust, which comes from Old English.</p>
<p>Again all of those words came from the same original Indo-European root word, meaning</p>
<p>red.</p>
<p>The Indo-Europeans also had a word which was pronounced something like speck, which meant</p>
<p>to look, and that word is the ultimate ancestor of the modern English words spectate and spectator</p>
<p>and lots of other words as we&rsquo;ll see in a second.</p>
<p>But I should note that the word look is an Old English word of unknown origin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not related to this ancient Indo-European word, even though it has essentially the same</p>
<p>meaning in modern English.</p>
<p>Like the modern English word look, the ancient Indo-European word speck could mean the act</p>
<p>of looking at something or it could mean how something looked, as in he looks at the sunset</p>
<p>or he looks very sick.</p>
<p>The word speck could also be used both ways.</p>
<p>Speck is also the root of the Latin word specara, which is actually the source of the</p>
<p>words spectate and spectator, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the source of words like spectacle, speculate, inspect, aspect, suspect, and conspicuous,</p>
<p>all having to do with the way something looks or an aspect of something which can be observed</p>
<p>or discerned.</p>
<p>That same Indo-European word speck also produced the words spy and espionage when the French</p>
<p>borrowed the terms from the Franks, who were another Germanic tribe who, despite their</p>
<p>Germanic origins, are ultimately responsible for the founding of the modern French state.</p>
<p>The word speck evolved into early Greek as well.</p>
<p>Remember the Greek language is also an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>But the Greeks reversed the P and the K in the original Indo-European root word speck</p>
<p>and they came up with the Greek word skopian, which eventually finds its way into English</p>
<p>as scope, as in telescope, microscope, and periscope, again all having to do with the</p>
<p>process of looking at something.</p>
<p>The Greek version also found its way into English as the word skeptic, as in to see</p>
<p>through something or look at something critically.</p>
<p>And it may be harder to see it, but the Greek version of the word also finds its way into</p>
<p>certain early religious terms, like episcopalian and bishop.</p>
<p>In these words, the term is being used in its sense as an overseer.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to a word which the Indo-Europeans had for man.</p>
<p>In fact, the Indo-Europeans had two words for man.</p>
<p>They had the word man and they had a separate word, wero, which meant man as well.</p>
<p>Both of these words came into Old English.</p>
<p>From the Indo-European root word man, Old English also had the word man, but it was</p>
<p>used in a much more general sense at the time, meaning a person, as in mankind, like all</p>
<p>men are created equal.</p>
<p>It could be used in reference to both males and females, men and women, collectively.</p>
<p>But the other Indo-European root word, wero, specifically meant males.</p>
<p>In other words, it had basically the same meaning as the modern English word man.</p>
<p>It strictly referred to males, adult males really.</p>
<p>So in Old English, man meant person, and wero meant man.</p>
<p>And Old English also had the word weef, which meant woman.</p>
<p>Now we rarely see the use of the word wero as man in modern English, but there are a</p>
<p>couple of examples.</p>
<p>The best example is probably werewolf, which literally means man-wolf.</p>
<p>We also see it in a word from the period of the Germanic tribes, before the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>became the English.</p>
<p>The term was wergeld, which literally meant man-money.</p>
<p>Amongst the Germanic tribes, if a member of one family killed a member of another family,</p>
<p>the dispute could be resolved with the payment of money, from the murderer&rsquo;s family to</p>
<p>the victim&rsquo;s family to compensate for the killing.</p>
<p>There were very specific rules to determine the rate of compensation.</p>
<p>This was the wergeld, so we see the use of wer as man in that word.</p>
<p>That same Indo-European root word, which produced the Old English word wer, is also the source</p>
<p>of the word world, which basically meant the home of man.</p>
<p>During the Middle English period, wero, meaning man, started to disappear, and the word man</p>
<p>began to be used in its place to mean an adult male.</p>
<p>But man also continued to be used in a more generic sense to refer to people.</p>
<p>This dual usage still exists in modern English, and it creates problems where we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be sexist, so we often have to modify the word man when it&rsquo;s used in its original</p>
<p>sense as persons or humans.</p>
<p>So we take a word like mankind, and we have to make a new word to accompany it, like womankind.</p>
<p>Or we have to change a word like chairman, which initially used the word man in its generic</p>
<p>Old English sense, and we now have to create a more gender-neutral term like chairperson.</p>
<p>So this is the challenge we have in a modern society using words that have changed their</p>
<p>meaning over time.</p>
<p>I mentioned that Old English used wer to refer to a man, and weef to refer to a woman.</p>
<p>Of course we still have weef in modern English as the word wife, but again the sense has</p>
<p>changed from a generic term for an adult woman in its original usage, to its modern usage</p>
<p>as the word wife, meaning a term for a married woman.</p>
<p>We still see the initial generic use of the term in a few older words which still linger</p>
<p>into modern English, like midwife, and even the phrase old wives tale, where the sense</p>
<p>is just a woman, not necessarily a married woman.</p>
<p>Some people believe weef also goes back to Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>But outside of the Germanic languages, the only possible cognates appear to be in the</p>
<p>Ticarian language discovered in China, and even then the reconstructed roots don&rsquo;t directly</p>
<p>relate to women or females.</p>
<p>So the Indo-European roots of weef are uncertain at best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably best to just say that its roots are unknown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other final aspect of Indo-European vocabulary that I want to point out.</p>
<p>The linguistic evidence suggests that the original Indo-European speaking people practiced</p>
<p>epic poetry, a form that used stock phrases, some of which show up in poetry preserved</p>
<p>to the present day in works like the Iliad and other ancient texts.</p>
<p>These include terms like driving cattle, and the phrase undying fame, as well as the stock</p>
<p>phrase immortal gods.</p>
<p>These stock phrases can be traced back to the original Indo-European language, and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been used ever since in epic poetry and other writings and texts throughout the Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>So that concludes my look at specific Indo-European words, many of which have come down to us</p>
<p>in modern English.</p>
<p>But just as importantly, these words helped to paint a picture of who these original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were and how they lived.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to put all of these pieces together very shortly to try to determine</p>
<p>exactly when and where they lived.</p>
<p>And based on archaeological evidence and other historical records, we&rsquo;ll try to identify</p>
<p>exactly who these people were.</p>
<p>But before we do that, I want to turn away from the vocabulary or words which these Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>used, and I want to spend a few minutes on how they used those words, specifically their</p>
<p>grammar.</p>
<p>Now, this may seem a bit boring, but it&rsquo;s actually very important as it helps to introduce</p>
<p>some concepts which are essential to understanding Old English.</p>
<p>So in the next episode, which may be a short episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at the original</p>
<p>Indo-European grammar.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll put all of the pieces of evidence together to determine exactly who these Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
