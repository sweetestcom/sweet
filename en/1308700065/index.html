    <p>Our card this week is Sherry Black, the Nine of Hearts from Utah.</p>
<p>This is part two of her story.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet, go back and listen to the previous episode because in that I told</p>
<p>you about the start of the investigation into a horrifying murder that rocked the community</p>
<p>of South Salt Lake in Utah.</p>
<p>When we left off, it had been more than a year since the murder.</p>
<p>And even though the police had the killer&rsquo;s DNA, they had no suspects or motive.</p>
<p>But Sherry&rsquo;s daughter, Heidi Miller, had just come across some information that she</p>
<p>hoped could change the trajectory of the entire investigation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>A friend had given Heidi a copy of a book called The Murder Room by Michael Capuzzo,</p>
<p>which details the creation of the V-Doc Society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned them on this show before.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an exclusive group of active and former investigators and forensic experts</p>
<p>who review unsolved homicides.</p>
<p>Once she learned more about the V-Doc Society, Heidi called the lead detective at South Salt</p>
<p>Lake to suggest bringing them on board.</p>
<p>And she was excited to hear that the department had already taken steps in that direction.</p>
<p>Now, usually V-Doc didn&rsquo;t look at cases that were less than two years old, but this time</p>
<p>they made an exception.</p>
<p>According to Nate Carlisle&rsquo;s reporting for the Salt Lake Tribune, in March of 2012, a</p>
<p>small group of V-Doc Society members came out to Utah and spent a few days poring over</p>
<p>the evidence in Sherry&rsquo;s case with the police.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s criminologist Patrick Zerpoli, one of the former members who went out there.</p>
<p>I think the most important piece of all of this is that you have to understand, A, how</p>
<p>the offender gets there, and B, how does the offender know that she&rsquo;s alone?</p>
<p>How do you know that someone&rsquo;s not coming out of the house with a shotgun when they</p>
<p>hear her screaming?</p>
<p>So that tells you a lot, A, about the offender themselves, and then kind of tells you from</p>
<p>the beginning where your investigation needs to go.</p>
<p>Another big thing is, why is she a victim?</p>
<p>Why is, how did they come to say that on that day, at that time, Sherry Black is a victim?</p>
<p>Based on the evidence they reviewed, V-Doc members thought that the perpetrator was probably</p>
<p>a younger man, under 30, maybe even a juvenile, and it was likely that he lived near B&amp;W Billiards</p>
<p>and Books, possibly within a few blocks.</p>
<p>V-Doc offering its expertise meant the world to Heidi.</p>
<p>The group couldn&rsquo;t share many details with the Blacks about Sherry&rsquo;s case, although</p>
<p>they did assure her that they thought it was solvable, and they gave South Salt Lake PD</p>
<p>a list of to-dos that they thought would further the investigation.</p>
<p>But months passed, then years, and it wasn&rsquo;t getting solved.</p>
<p>In all fairness, South Salt Lake PD looked into dozens of potential leads and suspects</p>
<p>over the years.</p>
<p>People who lived in the area, students at a nearby high school, sex offenders, parolees,</p>
<p>other local killers, and even a man whose name will definitely be familiar to many of</p>
<p>you, Israel Keyes.</p>
<p>After the FBI determined Israel had traveled to Utah several times, the agency asked law</p>
<p>enforcement throughout the state to review their unsolved homicides and see if he could</p>
<p>be their guy.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t in Utah when Sherry was killed, and his DNA didn&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, none of those other suspects panned out either.</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s family grew more and more frustrated with South Salt Lake&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Heidi again.</p>
<p>I think they didn&rsquo;t have all the resources or tools or knowledge that they needed on</p>
<p>a case that they hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>Heidi also felt like the case had just kind of stalled out.</p>
<p>It seemed like the police were just waiting for a DNA hit in CODIS to just ball in their</p>
<p>laps rather than actively looking for the killer or meticulously working their way</p>
<p>through the to-dos left behind by the VDOC society.</p>
<p>Patrick said that he had gotten the same vibes, and he thought the early investigation was</p>
<p>lacking to some extent because of that languid mentality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that, you know, weren&rsquo;t done initially that could have been done or</p>
<p>should have been done initially.</p>
<p>I think in this case here a little bit, it kind of went down that road because once they</p>
<p>got a full DNA sample that we&rsquo;re just going to wait for the phone call from the FBI saying</p>
<p>we matched the DNA.</p>
<p>So the Unified PD, a larger department with more resources, started helping South Salt</p>
<p>Lake PD in 2015.</p>
<p>That was when Detective Ben Pender took on a larger role.</p>
<p>We took measures to try and get the case taken from South Salt Lake and given to Unified.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s worth noting that cases don&rsquo;t typically get transferred from one police</p>
<p>department to another.</p>
<p>And I doubt that it would have happened if Heidi Black wasn&rsquo;t now Heidi Miller.</p>
<p>You see, even though she came from a humble upbringing, Heidi married into a prominent</p>
<p>influential family.</p>
<p>Her husband was the CEO of the company that owned the Utah Jazz at the time, and a lot</p>
<p>of other businesses in and around Salt Lake.</p>
<p>So people knew who they were.</p>
<p>It gave them more power than an average family in this situation normally has.</p>
<p>They leveraged the weight of the family name to have the case change hands and to keep</p>
<p>investigators focused on it, even as time passed.</p>
<p>So Detective Pender met with Sherry&rsquo;s family regularly to share developments.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t long before he had a big one for them.</p>
<p>In August of 2015, an exhibit at an annual training conference caught his eye.</p>
<p>Parabon Nanolabs had recently unveiled a new forensic tool that could take someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>DNA sample and generate a composite sketch of them, from their skin, eye, and hair color,</p>
<p>all the way to their face shape.</p>
<p>Predictions came with varying confidence levels, since you can&rsquo;t know exactly what a person</p>
<p>looks like just from their DNA.</p>
<p>I mean, also, anyone can change their appearance, especially someone who knows that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wanted for murder.</p>
<p>And there were understandable concerns that the technology could lead to racial profiling.</p>
<p>But some of the composites that they had done were incredibly accurate.</p>
<p>And Detective Pender figured they had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Police already knew Sherry&rsquo;s killer was multiracial, but Parabon&rsquo;s test could break his ancestry</p>
<p>down even more and give them some insight onto what he might look like.</p>
<p>So a few months later, investigators sent Parabon a DNA sample from the crime scene.</p>
<p>The lab did their thing, and in February of 2016, police got results.</p>
<p>The tests showed that the killer&rsquo;s roots were approximately 46% West African, 34% Northern</p>
<p>European, and 5% South African.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure where the other few percentage points go.</p>
<p>Since no one knew how old he was, the company made three composites, what he might look</p>
<p>like at 25, 38, and 52 years old.</p>
<p>Parabon was nearly certain that the suspect had light brown or brown skin and black hair,</p>
<p>and they were 100% sure that he didn&rsquo;t have blue or green eyes.</p>
<p>So okay, great.</p>
<p>Anyone who matches that?</p>
<p>To find out, unified investigators re-canvassed the neighborhood, revisited old suspects,</p>
<p>interviewed and re-interviewed family, and followed up on tips as they came in, including</p>
<p>suggestions from the VDOC Society.</p>
<p>Some leads seemed promising, but ultimately, none of them led anywhere.</p>
<p>Detective Pender was stumped.</p>
<p>It was one of his first cases that he&rsquo;d worked in which there was no identifiable motive</p>
<p>to speak of.</p>
<p>He thought there had to be something that they were missing, some sort of connection</p>
<p>between Sherry and the killer that they just couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So according to Deseret News reporter Pat Reavey, in November 2017, on the seventh anniversary</p>
<p>of the murder, investigators released the Parabon composite to the public.</p>
<p>Police cautioned the public that the images were just approximations of what the killer</p>
<p>could look like, not photos of the actual suspect.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people realized that because they were immediately flooded</p>
<p>with tips.</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s family had also announced that they were increasing the reward money to $250,000,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure contributed to the influx of callers.</p>
<p>They followed up on every tip that they got, but when the dust cleared, they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>any closer to finding their killer.</p>
<p>So in 2018, Detective Pender reconnected with Parabon for a new DNA-related investigative</p>
<p>avenue, genetic genealogy.</p>
<p>That was the same year that Parabon started offering that service, spurred on by its popularity</p>
<p>after it was used to capture the Golden State killer.</p>
<p>So Detective Pender thought that it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>Parabon&rsquo;s researchers gave him a list of 300 to 500 names, all of whom were distant</p>
<p>relatives of the suspect.</p>
<p>I would reach out to them and see if they would be willing to transfer their private</p>
<p>genealogy over to GEDmatch and upload it to the public so we could use it for this case.</p>
<p>Most everyone turned him down, but he did have some success, especially after he started</p>
<p>traveling the country target testing people, which basically meant that genealogists would</p>
<p>identify relatives of the suspect and he would show up at their doors asking for DNA samples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried if I called that they would talk to family or friends and be encouraged</p>
<p>not to cooperate.</p>
<p>So I just took gambles.</p>
<p>This method paid off.</p>
<p>Almost everyone that he approached agreed to give a DNA sample.</p>
<p>Now, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily narrowing down the search pool because they&rsquo;d cross one</p>
<p>name off the list only to add five more.</p>
<p>But in the fall of 2020, nearly 10 years after Sherry was killed, he got a call that changed</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>A new profile uploaded to GEDmatch strongly linked the suspect&rsquo;s DNA to a woman in California.</p>
<p>After doing some research, the genealogist thought she was a closer relation to the suspect</p>
<p>than anyone they had come across.</p>
<p>So Detective Pender hopped on a plane and headed out to see her as soon as he could.</p>
<p>On the way, he did some research of his own and learned that she lived with her adult</p>
<p>son.</p>
<p>But based on everything they knew so far, he didn&rsquo;t think the son was the culprit,</p>
<p>and the son&rsquo;s own kids were too young.</p>
<p>When he showed up, the woman and her son both agreed to give DNA samples.</p>
<p>But even as they talked, he couldn&rsquo;t tell how they were related to the suspect.</p>
<p>No obvious connections jumped out until Detective Pender asked the son a question.</p>
<p>Hey, any chance you have an older child out there?</p>
<p>And it turned out that about 30 years ago, the son&rsquo;s high school girlfriend had gotten</p>
<p>pregnant.</p>
<p>She ended up moving to Salt Lake City, and he never met the boy that she gave birth to.</p>
<p>But he did have a baby photo of him with the child&rsquo;s name written on it, Antonio Spencer.</p>
<p>This was the strongest lead police had ever gotten.</p>
<p>After I left, I got on the phone with the genealogist, told her what I came up with,</p>
<p>and we were just going crazy.</p>
<p>But right away, they hit a snag.</p>
<p>Even though they found Antonio&rsquo;s mother easily enough, there was no sign of Antonio.</p>
<p>But through more research, they discovered that the boy had been adopted when he was</p>
<p>a child after the state removed him from his mother&rsquo;s care.</p>
<p>His name had been changed to Adam Antonio Spencer Durboro.</p>
<p>And by the time they tracked him down, he was 29 years old and living in Orem, Utah,</p>
<p>about 35 minutes away from South Salt Lake.</p>
<p>In his hotel room that night, Detective Pender conducted a marathon research session.</p>
<p>He wanted to learn everything he could about Adam, and what he found was disturbing.</p>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s adopted father, Joseph Paul Durboro, had served time in prison for sexually abusing</p>
<p>children and distributing child sexual abuse material, which included photos of one of</p>
<p>his adopted daughters.</p>
<p>The Durboros had 10 foster-slash-adopted kids in their care at the time of Joseph&rsquo;s 2002</p>
<p>including Adam.</p>
<p>And get this, KSL reported that none of the children were removed from the home because</p>
<p>social workers didn&rsquo;t think that Joseph&rsquo;s wife knew about her husband&rsquo;s misdeeds.</p>
<p>In high school, Adam was in a program for what Detective Pender referred to as, quote</p>
<p>unquote, troubled youth.</p>
<p>And Pender saw that Adam had some pretty serious stuff on his juvenile criminal record.</p>
<p>When he was 14, he was arrested for attempted rape and aggravated assault for an incident</p>
<p>involving a girl under 14.</p>
<p>He ultimately pled guilty to attempted kidnapping.</p>
<p>And then when he was 16, he was convicted of aggravated assault after threatening someone</p>
<p>with a piece of broken glass.</p>
<p>Now those are felonies, and even as a juvenile, Adam was ordered to provide a DNA sample.</p>
<p>But frustratingly, it didn&rsquo;t happen, although it&rsquo;s not clear why.</p>
<p>Despite a concerning juvenile record, Adam didn&rsquo;t have much of an adult criminal record.</p>
<p>Two shoplifting convictions, one from about a month before Sherry&rsquo;s murder and one a</p>
<p>couple of months after.</p>
<p>So his fingerprints were on file.</p>
<p>But remember, the poor quality prints collected from Sherry&rsquo;s crime scene hadn&rsquo;t yielded</p>
<p>any matches.</p>
<p>Pender also saw from the court records that Adam&rsquo;s biological mother had picked him</p>
<p>up after his first shoplifting arrest, and her apartment was a little over a mile from</p>
<p>B&amp;W.</p>
<p>So he could have been familiar with it.</p>
<p>And then there was his Facebook account, where he went by the name Jace Ranting.</p>
<p>Detective Pender thought some of Adam&rsquo;s older photos bore an uncanny resemblance to</p>
<p>Parabon&rsquo;s 25-year-old suspect composite.</p>
<p>And some of his posts were alarming.</p>
<p>For instance, on the second anniversary of Sherry&rsquo;s murder, he posted a meme, this cartoon</p>
<p>drawing of a guy sitting in a bloody bathroom holding a saw.</p>
<p>And the caption was, quote, don&rsquo;t upset me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running out of places to hide the bodies, end quote.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, Detective Pender didn&rsquo;t want to get his hopes up too high.</p>
<p>But this guy was looking better every second.</p>
<p>And when he got back to Utah, he and other investigators immediately started tailing</p>
<p>Adam, who was working at Walmart and living with a roommate.</p>
<p>They waited for a good time to grab his DNA.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday, October 7th, they got their chance when they saw him use and then throw</p>
<p>out a drinking straw.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, Detective Pender took the straw and the other items they collected</p>
<p>over to the crime lab for testing.</p>
<p>One of the forensic scientists who&rsquo;s been working the case, she indicated she was going</p>
<p>to stick around, at least kind of just get started on it.</p>
<p>And they said, probably two to four days, we&rsquo;ll have an answer.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long.</p>
<p>A text from the forensic scientist woke him up at around 2 a.m.</p>
<p>She told him it was a match.</p>
<p>Their decade-long search was finally over.</p>
<p>But their work was far from finished.</p>
<p>And my work was put on pause.</p>
<p>You see, I started working on this story in January of 2019.</p>
<p>I met Heidi through her foundation, which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out that she and her daughters were crime junkies.</p>
<p>They were familiar with the show that I had just put out about the Burger Chef murders</p>
<p>called Red Ball.</p>
<p>And Heidi hoped that I&rsquo;d consider her mom&rsquo;s case for a second season.</p>
<p>Within a month, I was out in Utah meeting with her and Detective Pender, the whole Miller</p>
<p>family in fact.</p>
<p>We thought that the 10-year anniversary would be a great time to put everything out into</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>But then they had their man.</p>
<p>When I got word of an arrest, I just put everything on pause.</p>
<p>I mean, the goal of the show was to help bring attention to the case in hopes of solving</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But now it was solved.</p>
<p>So my only new goal was to not f*** that up.</p>
<p>I sat on everything I had and watched the case unfold with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, October 10th, police arrested Adam at Walmart, where he was about</p>
<p>to start a shift.</p>
<p>On the way to the police station, Adam told Detective Pender that he was pretty sure that</p>
<p>he knew what this was about.</p>
<p>And if he was right, he wanted a lawyer.</p>
<p>They had enough evidence to arrest Adam without a confession, but this was their chance to</p>
<p>get Sherry&rsquo;s family the answers that they had been wanting for years.</p>
<p>So just for clarification, police do have to stop questioning a suspect once they ask</p>
<p>for a lawyer, but they are allowed to keep talking to them, even though it can be tricky</p>
<p>legal territory.</p>
<p>So Detective Pender decided to take another gamble.</p>
<p>At the station, he told Adam that he understood he wanted a lawyer, so he&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>ask him a single question.</p>
<p>He just wanted to fill him in.</p>
<p>Pender said they knew he killed Sherry Black, but what they all didn&rsquo;t understand was why.</p>
<p>He told Adam that he learned a lot about him recently, and he was sorry about everything</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d been through.</p>
<p>It seemed like he had done a good job of turning his life around.</p>
<p>I mean, after all, it had been years since he had even a minor mishap with the law.</p>
<p>With that being said, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine how difficult it had been for Adam to carry</p>
<p>this secret for a decade.</p>
<p>The way he saw it, Adam had two choices.</p>
<p>Come clean, give himself and Sherry&rsquo;s family some small peace of mind, or just keep holding</p>
<p>everything in.</p>
<p>I talked to him for about five to seven minutes, and then I stopped.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask any questions.</p>
<p>I just stopped talking.</p>
<p>We sat there for a couple of minutes in silence.</p>
<p>Then Adam started to speak.</p>
<p>We got a copy of the video recorded interview through a records request.</p>
<p>When you guys stopped me today, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t done anything else in my life, but</p>
<p>I definitely felt some relief, which sounds odd.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s for so much readers, why not just come forward, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just been one of those things where it&rsquo;s like, I have so many people in my life</p>
<p>now that I just didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so selfish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long 10 years.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say this is blood and wire, but honestly, it&rsquo;s just something that you need to know.</p>
<p>I went into that store, and I had no intention at all to do anything.</p>
<p>It was a bookstore.</p>
<p>I love books.</p>
<p>It was just, I don&rsquo;t know, I just, I was just looking through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one else in the store, and it had been a rough week, I remember that.</p>
<p>He told detectives his mom had been worried he was headed down a bad path.</p>
<p>He had been living with proctor parents, what Detective Pender described as kind of like</p>
<p>foster parents for troubled youth, but they didn&rsquo;t think he was making progress either.</p>
<p>That November, they had gone on vacation without him.</p>
<p>I just, I was so angry.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know, I just lashed out.</p>
<p>It just happened.</p>
<p>She was there, and I just, it&rsquo;s a mistake that I wish every day that I had never, ever made.</p>
<p>I was young.</p>
<p>I was stupid.</p>
<p>I was so angry.</p>
<p>I was so confused.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t personal.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t planned.</p>
<p>It was spontaneous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I did it, not just that I didn&rsquo;t incorporate it, but I am sorry that I did it.</p>
<p>I wish I could take it back.</p>
<p>Detective Pender told him he really wanted to continue their discussion, if Adam wanted</p>
<p>to change his mind and formally agree to waive his Miranda rights.</p>
<p>If not, they would have to terminate the interview.</p>
<p>Adam decided he wanted to keep talking.</p>
<p>Well, I had an MRE at the bookstore, Adam.</p>
<p>Adam said that he was in the area that day because he had a therapy appointment.</p>
<p>He was staying with another family while his proctor parents were away, so he took a bus</p>
<p>from their house, got off somewhere, and just started walking around.</p>
<p>And then he spotted the sign for B&amp;W Billiards and Books.</p>
<p>He had been in the area before, just passing through, but never realized that there was</p>
<p>a bookstore there.</p>
<p>He said he had some time before therapy, so he went in to look around.</p>
<p>Sherry was at the cash register.</p>
<p>He asked if she had a particular book series, something in like the fantasy or sci-fi genre,</p>
<p>and she told him she didn&rsquo;t sell those kinds of books.</p>
<p>But he decided to browse anyway, but nothing caught his interest.</p>
<p>He told the detectives that he wandered into a little side room off the shop, the stock</p>
<p>room, and Sherry came back to see if he was all right.</p>
<p>I was just stewing, just, you know, just kind of silently fuming, I guess.</p>
<p>She was concerned.</p>
<p>She walked over, asked if everything was fine.</p>
<p>He said that he told her he didn&rsquo;t need any help.</p>
<p>She smiled at him and turned to walk back into the main area of the store.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Adam saw the shears.</p>
<p>There was a pair of scissors nearby, and I picked it up, picked them up, and I hit her.</p>
<p>I just hit her on the back of the head.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, just so angry and just so, she, she staggered, so I hit her several times.</p>
<p>Adam told the detectives that certain details of that morning were crystal clear, but not others.</p>
<p>Like, he said he didn&rsquo;t recall stabbing her in certain parts of her body.</p>
<p>I only remember just, just aggressively just hitting her in the back of the head.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So when you say you&rsquo;re aggressively hitting her, I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about the number</p>
<p>of times.</p>
<p>It was, it was repetitive.</p>
<p>It was fast.</p>
<p>And I was just whittling on her as hard as, as hard as I could, I know.</p>
<p>Adam told the detectives that he remembered punching her in the chest, hitting her over</p>
<p>the back of the head with the glass bottle and using the scissors to try and quote, cut</p>
<p>her throat open.</p>
<p>He said that she was face down on the ground and he flipped her over.</p>
<p>By then she was dead.</p>
<p>He told them he didn&rsquo;t really know why he pulled down her pants or why he lifted up</p>
<p>her shirt, but he said he had never seen anyone naked before and that maybe he&rsquo;d been curious.</p>
<p>And then he went on to explain some of what he did to her post-mortem.</p>
<p>Now remember, still, even 10 years later, the fact that she had been stabbed with scissors</p>
<p>was not public knowledge, neither was the sexual assault.</p>
<p>So police knew that he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>At some point, Adam says that he saw he was bleeding from his right hand.</p>
<p>I ran out of that store.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised nobody saw me.</p>
<p>I was just running.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if I had blood on my face or anything, but I just ran.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stop until I got to my therapist&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize what I had done until I was in the bathroom just struggling.</p>
<p>There were some things that either he didn&rsquo;t remember or he wouldn&rsquo;t admit to, like the</p>
<p>belt, for instance.</p>
<p>He had seen the news reports about police finding it at the scene, but he said he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember taking off his belt or even owning a belt like that.</p>
<p>He said that he wasn&rsquo;t sure of the date that he killed her, although he knew it happened</p>
<p>in November 2010, probably on a Tuesday, and he also wouldn&rsquo;t admit to biting her breast.</p>
<p>Adam said that he never told anyone what he had done, though occasionally he would check</p>
<p>for updates in the news, but usually he just tried to pretend that the whole thing never</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>When he heard about the DNA testing with Parabon in 2017, he figured it was only a matter of</p>
<p>time before he was caught.</p>
<p>But he said that he had made so many positive changes since that awful day, and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to lose everything he had, so he just kept hoping for one more day of freedom.</p>
<p>But there was still something that detectives didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>After his interview, Adam wrote a letter of apology to the family.</p>
<p>Then he was sent to jail to await trial on aggravated murder and aggravated burglary</p>
<p>charges.</p>
<p>I think they originally believed that he had stolen something from the bookstore.</p>
<p>After his confession, police made the phone call that they had been waiting to make for</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>The sheriff contacted the family and asked them to come to the office that we needed</p>
<p>to have a meeting with him.</p>
<p>I just said, we&rsquo;ve got him and he&rsquo;s in jail.</p>
<p>It was an emotional meeting for everyone involved, but there were still plenty of unanswered</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>Detective Pender told us that he was never able to verify if Adam actually did have a</p>
<p>therapy appointment that day.</p>
<p>His details on the location of the office were hazy and police couldn&rsquo;t find any records</p>
<p>to back it up.</p>
<p>And of course, the biggest question was, did Adam kill anyone else?</p>
<p>Police asked him and he said no.</p>
<p>Just based on his history and stuff and what I found after his arrest, you know, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely he was involved in anything else, but obviously I&rsquo;m not a positive.</p>
<p>Police did look into whether he was connected to at least two other unsolved homicides,</p>
<p>but his DNA didn&rsquo;t match the perpetrator&rsquo;s in either case.</p>
<p>Adam ended up pleading not guilty to Sherry&rsquo;s murder and was appointed a public defender.</p>
<p>Now his case was on hold for a while because of COVID-19 and it seemed like they might</p>
<p>be heading toward a trial, but to everyone&rsquo;s relief, Adam changed his mind and eventually</p>
<p>pled guilty to the murder charge in October, 2021.</p>
<p>Now the judge had some discretion when it came to Adam&rsquo;s sentence.</p>
<p>He could either send him to prison for 25 years to life, or he could send him to prison</p>
<p>with life without parole.</p>
<p>During a series of utterly gut-wrenching victim statements at Adam&rsquo;s sentencing in February</p>
<p>of 2022, Sherry&rsquo;s loved ones asked the judge to make sure he never got out.</p>
<p>One by one, they talked about how the murder had affected them.</p>
<p>Heidi said she didn&rsquo;t just lose her mother that day, but her dad too, because of his</p>
<p>overwhelming grief.</p>
<p>Michael told the judge that instead of having his beloved wife, he had the horrific memory</p>
<p>of how he found her in the stockroom.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one of Sherry&rsquo;s granddaughters, Courtney.</p>
<p>She helped anyone she could, any way she could.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the real irony of all of this.</p>
<p>She would have been an advocate for this perpetrator if only he&rsquo;d chosen a different path.</p>
<p>Instead, he preyed upon her.</p>
<p>He brutally took out all of his anger and frustration and hatred and rage on her, like</p>
<p>she was nothing, and she was not nothing.</p>
<p>Now there was some sympathy for Adam, initially, at least.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Pender again.</p>
<p>I mean, not that what he did was okay, but, you know, I had some empathy for him that</p>
<p>he had a rest life.</p>
<p>But once I started monitoring his jail calls, you know, it was just all about video games</p>
<p>and books.</p>
<p>And as long as he could make phone calls and talk to his friends and get some food to eat,</p>
<p>he seemed just fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a matter of even what he said, it&rsquo;s what he didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>He never once said, you know, I really feel bad for what I did.</p>
<p>Even the judge said that he felt bad for both sides of the courtroom.</p>
<p>The egregious nature of the crime called for life without parole.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Heidi told reporters that they could finally begin to heal.</p>
<p>And part of that healing process, long before Sherry&rsquo;s case was solved, was the formation</p>
<p>of the Sherry Black Foundation.</p>
<p>The foundation&rsquo;s goal is to create safer communities by using their resources to remove</p>
<p>barriers in the criminal justice system in order to advance investigations.</p>
<p>In a statement after Adam&rsquo;s sentencing, Heidi and her husband Greg said that they would</p>
<p>continue to work through the Sherry Black Foundation to educate law enforcement on investigative</p>
<p>techniques and support advanced DNA testing to help bring resolution to victims&rsquo; families.</p>
<p>And their work with the foundation is one of the reasons Heidi and her family still</p>
<p>wanted us to tell her mother&rsquo;s story, even after it was solved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to link out to their foundation in the show notes so you can learn more.</p>
<p>But there is another big reason that they wanted us to tell the story, and that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>of genealogy.</p>
<p>Sherry is one of genetic genealogy&rsquo;s many success stories.</p>
<p>And while studies have shown that about half of America is in favor of this method, it</p>
<p>also has raised significant privacy concerns.</p>
<p>But like decks of cold case cards, it&rsquo;s meant to be another tool in law enforcement&rsquo;s belt.</p>
<p>Not the only tool.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of misconceptions out there about it.</p>
<p>According to New York Post reporter Eric Spitznagel, only two commercial DNA databases can generally</p>
<p>be accessed by law enforcement.</p>
<p>And the best-known one, GEDmatch, requires users to opt in if they want their DNA profile</p>
<p>compared with kits submitted by police.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that, so I hope that&rsquo;s a big takeaway from this episode.</p>
<p>There are so many family members out there like Heidi waiting for answers that other</p>
<p>members of the true crime community can actually help solve by opting in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking you to do.</p>
<p>You can check our blog post for more information, including instructions on how to opt in if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested, and if you&rsquo;ve already taken a genealogy test from any company listed</p>
<p>on the instruction page.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t yet taken a test, the foundation that Heidi founded, the Sherry</p>
<p>Black Foundation, has been working with a company called Family Tree to offer promo</p>
<p>codes for their Family Finder kit.</p>
<p>You can visit FamilyTreeDNA.com and use promo code THEDEC, all caps in one word, to redeem.</p>
<p>You can upload your results to GEDmatch and opt in for yours to be used by law enforcement.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also another way you can join me in supporting the Sherry Black Foundation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 27th, at University of Utah&rsquo;s Kingsbury Hall, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a live panel discussion on Sherry&rsquo;s case called The Bookstore Murder, A Journey for Justice,</p>
<p>The Sherry Black Story.</p>
<p>I will be on that panel, and all proceeds from the event will go to the Sherry Black</p>
<p>Foundation.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ll see you there.</p>
<p>For more information and to purchase your ticket, head over to kingsburyhall.utah.edu.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll put that link in the show notes.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Sherry Black Foundation, check out our blog post for this episode at</p>
<p>thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>You can also visit sherryblackfoundation.org to learn more.</p>
<p>And lastly, you can find information about GEDmatch, Family Tree Ancestry, and the event</p>
<p>in Salt Lake City in the show notes and the blog post.</p>
<p>The Deck is an audio Chuck production with theme music by Ryan Lewis.</p>
