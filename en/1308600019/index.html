    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to continue our discussion</p>
<p>about hormones, and we&rsquo;re going to focus</p>
<p>on how particular hormones influence our energy levels</p>
<p>and our immune system.</p>
<p>Now, last episode, I mentioned at the end</p>
<p>that we were concluding our month on hormones,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve decided to include this additional episode,</p>
<p>so this would be the fifth episode</p>
<p>in the sequence of episodes about hormones,</p>
<p>because there are two hormones which are vitally important</p>
<p>for a huge number of biological functions</p>
<p>that we will talk about today,</p>
<p>but that are particularly important for energy levels</p>
<p>and your immune system.</p>
<p>This is something that I get asked about a lot.</p>
<p>So rather than skip to the next general topic,</p>
<p>today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the hormones cortisol</p>
<p>and epinephrine, also called adrenaline.</p>
<p>You do not have to have heard the previous episodes</p>
<p>on hormones in order to understand and digest the material</p>
<p>from today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>If I mention anything related to previous episodes,</p>
<p>I promise to give a little bit of quick background</p>
<p>to get everyone up to speed.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology of cortisol.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology of epinephrine.</p>
<p>As always, we&rsquo;ll talk mechanism,</p>
<p>and there are going to be a lot of tools.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who struggles with stress</p>
<p>and energy levels and balancing stress and energy levels,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is going to be vital for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who has challenges with sleep</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somebody who has challenges</p>
<p>getting your energy level up throughout the day</p>
<p>and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is also for you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about the immune system</p>
<p>and how to enhance the function of your immune system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to get into some fun topics</p>
<p>related to learning and memory</p>
<p>and how you can leverage cortisol</p>
<p>and epinephrine in particular in order to learn faster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about so-called nootropics,</p>
<p>smart drugs, and how they work,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s several of them</p>
<p>that tap into the epinephrine system</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t often discussed and that you have access to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about how caffeine</p>
<p>can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology of comfort foods</p>
<p>and why they work so well and what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And in understanding that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to better understand your food choices</p>
<p>as they relate to short-term and long-term energy.</p>
<p>So we have a lot to cover.</p>
<p>Everything will be timestamped.</p>
<p>I want to just remind people that we caption every episode</p>
<p>in English and in Spanish.</p>
<p>The captions take a day or two to pop up on YouTube.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not seeing those within the first couple days,</p>
<p>please be patient with us in order to get captions</p>
<p>that actually read similarly to what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>We go through a captioning service.</p>
<p>And so we have them done by experts</p>
<p>and that takes a little bit of additional time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have any questions as the episode evolves,</p>
<p>please write them down.</p>
<p>Please put them in the comment section.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to the channel if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s get started talking about</p>
<p>how to increase your energy</p>
<p>and improve and increase your immunity</p>
<p>by leveraging the biology of cortisol and adrenaline.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the biology of increasing energy</p>
<p>and your immune system,</p>
<p>I want to cover three topics</p>
<p>that I promised I would mention from previous episodes.</p>
<p>The first one relates to intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>The second one relates to why your stomach grumbles.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention the biology of that last time.</p>
<p>And the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>which is powerful for increasing metabolism,</p>
<p>fat burning and tissue repair, et cetera,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t involve a sauna</p>
<p>or wrapping yourself in plastic bags and going for a jog.</p>
<p>So first, intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Last episode, I talked a lot about growth hormone</p>
<p>and thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>And I mentioned things like sauna and exercise and sleep</p>
<p>and how they can increase levels of growth hormone</p>
<p>within the healthy ranges.</p>
<p>And why increasing growth hormone can be very beneficial</p>
<p>because it can burn off body fat,</p>
<p>it can improve muscle and general tissue health,</p>
<p>cartilage, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we tend to lose,</p>
<p>or our levels of growth hormone are reduced as we age.</p>
<p>Many people ask me, well, what about fasting?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s been promised on the internet</p>
<p>that intermittent fasting leads to these big increases</p>
<p>in growth hormone.</p>
<p>The reason I didn&rsquo;t mention it</p>
<p>is that I couldn&rsquo;t find a study</p>
<p>that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts,</p>
<p>lots of degrees behind people&rsquo;s names,</p>
<p>sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields</p>
<p>talking about this, but very few studies.</p>
<p>And then I found what I would consider the study.</p>
<p>We will link to this study.</p>
<p>Turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels</p>
<p>and the way that it does it is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous podcast</p>
<p>about hunger and timing of meals and timing of hunger,</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>you release a hormone in your body called ghrelin,</p>
<p>sometimes actually called ghrelin.</p>
<p>Thanks for all of you ghrelinistas or ghrelinistas</p>
<p>that corrected my pronunciation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both, ghrelin or ghrelin, either one works.</p>
<p>Ghrelin makes you hungry.</p>
<p>When blood glucose, your blood sugar is low,</p>
<p>ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.</p>
<p>And it turns out that ghrelin, this hunger hormone,</p>
<p>actually binds to the receptor in the brain</p>
<p>that normally binds</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called growth hormone releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, the hunger hormone</p>
<p>can act like growth hormone releasing hormone</p>
<p>and thereby stimulate growth hormone.</p>
<p>Now, the levels of growth hormone</p>
<p>that fasting promotes through this ghrelin system</p>
<p>are pretty substantial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a doubling of growth hormone levels</p>
<p>in the waking state.</p>
<p>So we know that you can release growth hormone in sleep.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting, it turns out,</p>
<p>can increase growth hormone by binding ghrelin</p>
<p>to the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor,</p>
<p>and it does it also during the daytime.</p>
<p>So yes, indeed, fasting can increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>not to the supra levels</p>
<p>that taking growth hormone would increase it</p>
<p>or that a sauna could increase it,</p>
<p>but it does seem to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>Later in today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about different patterns</p>
<p>of fasting and eating that can control epinephrine.</p>
<p>And so we will return to specifics about how long a fast.</p>
<p>Do you need to fast for two or three days or 23 hours?</p>
<p>Fortunately, for people like me who love to eat,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk specific fasting protocols</p>
<p>later in the episode.</p>
<p>We also said we were going to talk about tummy grumble.</p>
<p>When your stomach growls,</p>
<p>it is not because of fluid sifting around in there.</p>
<p>A lot of people think, oh, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fluid sifting around.</p>
<p>Turns out that your stomach has smooth muscle</p>
<p>that lines its sides.</p>
<p>And when you eat something or you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>every once in a while,</p>
<p>your stomach cinches off at the two ends,</p>
<p>like a bag with a hose on either end,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s essentially what your digestive system is.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s nothing in there,</p>
<p>what happens is the muscles</p>
<p>that line the sides of your stomach,</p>
<p>they kind of extend around the stomach in these cables.</p>
<p>Those are always there.</p>
<p>And if you have food in your stomach,</p>
<p>what they do is they churn your stomach.</p>
<p>They literally turn the muscles of your stomach</p>
<p>like a tumbler to help break up the food</p>
<p>that presumably you didn&rsquo;t chew well enough</p>
<p>because you were eating too fast.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have any food in your stomach,</p>
<p>that churning continues and that contraction of the muscle</p>
<p>and the turning, literally turning over of your muscles,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t flip over completely,</p>
<p>but the turning over the muscles,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what causes the stomach growling.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to be the person in the meeting</p>
<p>or sitting there in a quiet theater</p>
<p>whose stomach is growling, chew your food better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simple solution.</p>
<p>And last episode, I talked a lot about how sauna,</p>
<p>controlled safe hyperthermia,</p>
<p>can cause huge increases in growth hormone release,</p>
<p>anywhere from 300 to 500,</p>
<p>even 1,600% increases in growth hormone release,</p>
<p>really staggeringly high increases.</p>
<p>I point out that many people don&rsquo;t have saunas</p>
<p>in their yard or in their homes,</p>
<p>and they would go through some other measures</p>
<p>to increase safely their body heat,</p>
<p>creating a steam room in their bathroom</p>
<p>or jogging with extra sweats on, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Many of you asked about hot baths.</p>
<p>Hot baths will increase growth hormone, excuse me.</p>
<p>However, the temperatures that you need</p>
<p>in order to increase growth hormone</p>
<p>are high enough that you run the risk of burn.</p>
<p>And so I really can&rsquo;t make any recommendations</p>
<p>about hot baths, but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath,</p>
<p>you are going to get some growth hormone release.</p>
<p>However, the sauna has this advantage</p>
<p>of you being able to enter 175 degree</p>
<p>or 200 degree environment,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not pregnant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a young child, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can do that safely.</p>
<p>And getting big increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>the hot bath will lead to lesser increases</p>
<p>in growth hormone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about temperature regulation</p>
<p>in a future episode, but as always,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever going to start playing with hyperthermia</p>
<p>or hypothermia, cold baths, ice baths, hot showers,</p>
<p>hot baths that are beyond the kind of norm</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s comfortable, you have to be extremely careful</p>
<p>and please consult a doctor.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that most people</p>
<p>would like to have a lot of energy during the day,</p>
<p>if you work during the day,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d like their energy to taper off at night.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t enjoy being sick.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to get sick.</p>
<p>In other words, you want to have energy</p>
<p>and you want your immune system to function well,</p>
<p>to ward off infections of various kinds,</p>
<p>bacterial infections, viral infections, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the two hormones</p>
<p>that dominate those processes of having enough energy</p>
<p>and having a healthy immune system</p>
<p>are cortisol and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline.</p>
<p>In the body, we tend to call adrenaline adrenaline,</p>
<p>and in the brain, we tend to call adrenaline epinephrine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry for that, I didn&rsquo;t create this naming system.</p>
<p>And the story behind it is uninteresting</p>
<p>and not worth our time.</p>
<p>I will use the words adrenaline and epinephrine</p>
<p>interchangeably today.</p>
<p>Cortisol is cortisol.</p>
<p>And I just want to cover a little bit</p>
<p>about what cortisol and epinephrine are,</p>
<p>where they are released in the body and brain.</p>
<p>Because if you can understand that,</p>
<p>you will understand better how to control them.</p>
<p>First of all, cortisol is a steroid hormone,</p>
<p>much like estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>in that it is derived from cholesterol.</p>
<p>Now that could be cholesterol that you eat.</p>
<p>It could be cholesterol that&rsquo;s produced by the liver.</p>
<p>As many of you probably know,</p>
<p>the relationship between dietary cholesterol,</p>
<p>the fats that you eat,</p>
<p>and blood cholesterol and liver cholesterol</p>
<p>is a very controversial one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a barbed wire topic.</p>
<p>There are people that claim that dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>has zero impact on circulating cholesterol</p>
<p>coming from the liver.</p>
<p>There are people who argue the exact opposite,</p>
<p>both with good data in hand, I would say.</p>
<p>There are some problems for the idea</p>
<p>that all your cholesterol levels</p>
<p>are determined by dietary intake,</p>
<p>namely that anorexics often have very high levels</p>
<p>of cholesterol that their liver produces,</p>
<p>even though they are eating very little</p>
<p>and sometimes not eating at all.</p>
<p>So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s the substrate from which a lot of things</p>
<p>like testosterone and estrogen are made.</p>
<p>Please also understand that cholesterol</p>
<p>can be made into estrogen or testosterone or cortisol,</p>
<p>and that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner</p>
<p>to estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>What this means is no matter how much cholesterol</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating or you produce,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s low or it&rsquo;s high,</p>
<p>if you are stressed, more of that cholesterol</p>
<p>is going to be devoted toward creating cortisol,</p>
<p>which is indeed a stress hormone.</p>
<p>However, the word stress shouldn&rsquo;t stress you out</p>
<p>because you need cortisol.</p>
<p>Cortisol is vital.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your cortisol levels to be too low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important for immune system function,</p>
<p>for memory, for not getting depressed.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t want your cortisol levels to be too high,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want them to be elevated</p>
<p>even to normal levels at the wrong time of day.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to control the timing</p>
<p>and level of your cortisol.</p>
<p>Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit.</p>
<p>We think of it as this stress hormone,</p>
<p>this thing that makes us anxious, fight or flight.</p>
<p>You know, we used to get chased by lions</p>
<p>and tigers and bears, and now we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this ancient hangover.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all wrong.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that epinephrine</p>
<p>is your best friend when it comes to your immunity,</p>
<p>when it comes to protecting you from infection.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about why.</p>
<p>And epinephrine, adrenaline, is your best friend</p>
<p>when it comes to remembering things</p>
<p>and learning and activating neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about that as well.</p>
<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s a question of how much and how long</p>
<p>and the specific timing of release</p>
<p>of cortisol and epinephrine,</p>
<p>as opposed to cortisol and adrenaline being good or bad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re terrific when they&rsquo;re regulated.</p>
<p>They are terrible when they&rsquo;re misregulated.</p>
<p>And we will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.</p>
<p>Cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>Your brain makes what we call releasing hormones.</p>
<p>And in this case, there&rsquo;s corticotropin releasing hormone.</p>
<p>CRH is made by neurons in your brain.</p>
<p>It causes the pituitary, this gland that sits</p>
<p>about an inch in front of the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>and the base of your brain,</p>
<p>to release ACTH.</p>
<p>ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,</p>
<p>which sit above your kidneys and your lower back,</p>
<p>to release cortisol, a so-called stress hormone.</p>
<p>But I would like you to think about cortisol</p>
<p>not as a stress hormone, but as a hormone of energy.</p>
<p>It produces a situation in the brain and body</p>
<p>whereby you want to move</p>
<p>and whereby you don&rsquo;t want to rest</p>
<p>and whereby you don&rsquo;t want to eat, at least at first.</p>
<p>Epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>When you sense a stressor with your mind</p>
<p>or your body senses a stressor, excuse me,</p>
<p>from a wound or something of that sort,</p>
<p>a signal is sent to neurons</p>
<p>that are in the middle of your body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the sympathetic chain ganglia.</p>
<p>The name doesn&rsquo;t necessarily matter.</p>
<p>They release norepinephrine very quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a sprinkler system</p>
<p>that just hoses your body with epinephrine.</p>
<p>That will increase heart rate,</p>
<p>will increase breathing rate.</p>
<p>In some cases, it will constrict your blood vessels.</p>
<p>It will also increase the size of vessels and arteries</p>
<p>that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.</p>
<p>This is why your extremities get cold when you&rsquo;re stressed</p>
<p>and your heart is beating faster.</p>
<p>More of that energy is being devoted toward your core.</p>
<p>You also release adrenaline from your adrenals in, again,</p>
<p>riding atop your kidneys.</p>
<p>Those are a second system</p>
<p>whereby your system gets flooded with adrenaline in pulses.</p>
<p>So you can get one pulse, you can get 10 pulses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how to regulate the number of pulses.</p>
<p>And you release it from an area of your brain</p>
<p>called locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>and that creates alertness in your brain.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the stress response</p>
<p>and all the details of that,</p>
<p>including some protocols of how to regulate stress,</p>
<p>please see our episode about stress.</p>
<p>I go into a lot of detail there.</p>
<p>I will touch on some of the same themes today,</p>
<p>but I really want to cover energy and the immune system.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re very much interested in stress per se</p>
<p>and stress regulation, please see the episode on stress.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have cortisol and we have epinephrine,</p>
<p>and their net effect is to increase energy.</p>
<p>So first of all, I want to give you a tool</p>
<p>that will help you regulate cortisol</p>
<p>and can also help stave off</p>
<p>certain patterns of mental illness.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it&rsquo;s not going to cure mental illness</p>
<p>on its own, but it can support healthy state of mind</p>
<p>and can help reduce unhealthy states of mind,</p>
<p>including depression.</p>
<p>So the first tool is to make sure</p>
<p>that your highest levels of cortisol</p>
<p>are first thing in the morning when you wake up.</p>
<p>One way or another, every 24 hours,</p>
<p>you will get an increase in cortisol.</p>
<p>That is non-negotiable, that is written into your genome.</p>
<p>That increase in cortisol is there to wake you up</p>
<p>and to make you alert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to stimulate movement from being asleep,</p>
<p>presumably horizontal, to getting up</p>
<p>and starting to move about your day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said it before, but I will say it again,</p>
<p>the best way to stimulate that increase in cortisol</p>
<p>at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking,</p>
<p>within 30 minutes or so after waking,</p>
<p>get outside, view some sunlight.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s overcast, get outside, view some sunlight,</p>
<p>no sunglasses, never look at any light so bright</p>
<p>that it could damage your eyes,</p>
<p>but do that for two to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s very bright, two minutes,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not so bright, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Do that because in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity to time that cortisol release</p>
<p>to the early part of the day, which will improve,</p>
<p>this has been backed by peer-reviewed studies,</p>
<p>it will improve your focus,</p>
<p>it will improve your energy levels,</p>
<p>and it will improve your learning throughout the day.</p>
<p>It will also prevent a late shift in cortisol increase.</p>
<p>And late shifted cortisol,</p>
<p>meaning cortisol that increases around eight or 9 p.m.,</p>
<p>is a signature feature of many depressive disorders,</p>
<p>including major depression, anxiety,</p>
<p>and that of course correlates</p>
<p>with things like insomnia, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a key tool,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how many of you are already doing that,</p>
<p>but it is vital to do.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned sunlight even on cloudy days,</p>
<p>and there are specific reasons for that.</p>
<p>So I want to just briefly cover the data,</p>
<p>because in the episodes on sleep,</p>
<p>I talked about brightness of light</p>
<p>in regulating cortisol and sleep,</p>
<p>and I talked about how to measure lux, brightness,</p>
<p>but I was not specific enough, I realized,</p>
<p>based on the questions that I&rsquo;ve received</p>
<p>since that episode.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Going outside and getting some sunlight</p>
<p>requires that I also tell you how long</p>
<p>and under what conditions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said, looking through a window is not as good,</p>
<p>it takes 50 times longer to get as much light,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Many, many questions have told me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not being specific enough.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you the data,</p>
<p>and from the data, you will understand</p>
<p>exactly how long you need to do this each day.</p>
<p>On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,</p>
<p>provided that the sun is not yet overhead,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somewhere low in the sky,</p>
<p>could have just crossed the horizon,</p>
<p>or if you wake up a little bit later,</p>
<p>it could be somewhat low in the sky.</p>
<p>Basically, the intensity of light, the brightness,</p>
<p>is somewhere around 100,000 lux.</p>
<p>Lux is just a measurement of brightness.</p>
<p>If you want to download the app Light Meter,</p>
<p>that is a free app that will allow you to do that,</p>
<p>you can hold your finger down on the little button there,</p>
<p>and you can move it around,</p>
<p>and it will continuously give you a lux readout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, it&rsquo;s not exact,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty good, and it is zero cost.</p>
<p>I have no relationship to Light Meter, the company.</p>
<p>On a cloudy day, it&rsquo;s about 10,000 lux, okay?</p>
<p>So tenfold reduction.</p>
<p>But bright artificial light, very bright artificial light,</p>
<p>is somewhere around 1,000 lux.</p>
<p>And ordinary room light is somewhere around 100 to 200 lux.</p>
<p>And it has to do with how much light scatter there is.</p>
<p>So even if you have a very bright bulb</p>
<p>sitting right next to you, that&rsquo;s not going to do the job.</p>
<p>Your phone will not do the job, not early in the day.</p>
<p>To get the cortisol released at the appropriate time,</p>
<p>you need to get outside.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just set a couple general parameters.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s bright outside and no cloud cover,</p>
<p>the light can be indirect.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be staring into the sun.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t damage your eyes.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t regenerate those neurons yet</p>
<p>and restore vision that&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>But if you have to blink, that means it&rsquo;s too bright.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to blink, of course.</p>
<p>Please do if you need to.</p>
<p>Get outside for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Or five minutes should suffice,</p>
<p>but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a cloudy day, dense overcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to need about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s light cloud, broken cloud cover,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to be somewhere</p>
<p>between 10 and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t get outside or you&rsquo;re on an airplane</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bright overhead artificial lights</p>
<p>or ordinary room lights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take you about six hours of light.</p>
<p>And by time you reach the middle</p>
<p>of your sort of wakeful period, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to shift your clock</p>
<p>and your cortisol will start drifting later and later.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s vital to get this light</p>
<p>on a regular basis to get that cortisol released</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>That sets you up for optimal levels of energy.</p>
<p>It sets you up for great sleep,</p>
<p>but today&rsquo;s not really about sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about energy.</p>
<p>That cortisol pulse and the stress</p>
<p>that you might feel early in the day</p>
<p>from having a little bit extra energy,</p>
<p>that is the energy that you want in order to move about</p>
<p>and learn and do various things.</p>
<p>That is a healthy level of energy.</p>
<p>So please try and get that sunlight</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s within your protocols to do that</p>
<p>and try and get sufficient sunlight</p>
<p>first thing in the morning, again, within the first hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to make sure</p>
<p>that you time your cortisol appropriately.</p>
<p>Now, throughout the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience different things.</p>
<p>Most of you are not spending your entire day</p>
<p>trying to optimize your health.</p>
<p>Some of you might be, but most of you have jobs</p>
<p>and you have families and you have commitments.</p>
<p>Life enters the picture and provides you stressors.</p>
<p>And those stressors, whatever they may happen to be,</p>
<p>a difficult coworker,</p>
<p>some disappointment about something,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t get the raise you expected</p>
<p>or you didn&rsquo;t get the vacation that you expected,</p>
<p>those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.</p>
<p>This is important to understand.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the luxury of just having</p>
<p>this morning cortisol and then having it taper off.</p>
<p>You want that major cortisol early in the day,</p>
<p>but then you can expect, you should expect,</p>
<p>increases in cortisol and adrenaline throughout the day</p>
<p>based on events that are unpleasant to you.</p>
<p>So for me, the events that are most unpleasant to me</p>
<p>are things like traffic,</p>
<p>emails that ask me to fill out a form</p>
<p>for which I can&rsquo;t find the link.</p>
<p>These kinds of things stress me out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human being.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lose my cool over them,</p>
<p>but I can feel my level of alertness</p>
<p>and kind of frustration increase.</p>
<p>The normal kind of things that go with stress</p>
<p>tense up a little bit.</p>
<p>The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine</p>
<p>need to be brief.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have them so often or lasting so long</p>
<p>that you are in a state of chronic cortisol elevation</p>
<p>or chronic epinephrine elevation.</p>
<p>This system of stress was designed</p>
<p>to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things,</p>
<p>get you frustrated and provide the opportunity</p>
<p>to change behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they were designed to do.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself getting stressed</p>
<p>and staying stressed,</p>
<p>there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode</p>
<p>that relate to things like the double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>the so-called physiological sigh.</p>
<p>You can incorporate an NSDR,</p>
<p>a non-sleep deep rest protocol, et cetera.</p>
<p>But understand that the energy</p>
<p>that you experience during stress,</p>
<p>that sudden increase in alertness and attention</p>
<p>that comes from seeing something difficult,</p>
<p>that is a healthy hormonal system</p>
<p>and neural system that&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And the reason it works is that cortisol,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s released into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>it actually can bind to receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>It can bind receptors in the amygdala,</p>
<p>fear centers and threat detection centers,</p>
<p>but also areas of the brain that are involved</p>
<p>in learning and memory and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And this is why I say that neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change itself</p>
<p>in response to experience</p>
<p>is first stimulated by attention and focus</p>
<p>and often a low-level state of agitation.</p>
<p>So understand that,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be quite so troubled</p>
<p>about the little stress increases</p>
<p>that you experience throughout the day.</p>
<p>Now, there are ways to leverage stress,</p>
<p>epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you</p>
<p>and to do it in a deliberate way.</p>
<p>There are also ways to do that</p>
<p>that increase your level of stress threshold,</p>
<p>meaning they make it less likely</p>
<p>that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about the science of those practices,</p>
<p>because I get asked about these practices a lot.</p>
<p>Things like Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>which is also called TUMO breathing,</p>
<p>things like ice baths,</p>
<p>things like high-intensity interval training.</p>
<p>All of those things have utility.</p>
<p>The question is how you use them and how often you use them.</p>
<p>Those tools, just like stress from a life event,</p>
<p>can either enhance your immunity or deplete it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Those same practices of ice baths, TUMO breathing,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training or training of any kind</p>
<p>can deplete your immune system or it can improve them.</p>
<p>Excuse me, they can improve it,</p>
<p>meaning they can improve your immune system.</p>
<p>The key is how often you use them and when.</p>
<p>And so I want to review that now</p>
<p>in light of the scientific literature,</p>
<p>because in doing that,</p>
<p>you can build practices into your daily</p>
<p>or maybe every other day routine</p>
<p>that can really help buffer you</p>
<p>against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine,</p>
<p>meaning cortisol increases that are much too great</p>
<p>or that last much too long.</p>
<p>Epinephrine increases that are much too great</p>
<p>or that last much too long.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ll talk about all the negatives</p>
<p>that go along with having too much cortisol,</p>
<p>too much epinephrine for too long,</p>
<p>but you hear about those a lot.</p>
<p>You hear about Cushing syndrome.</p>
<p>You hear about abdominal fat accumulation.</p>
<p>You hear about sleep disturbances.</p>
<p>I want to arm you with the tools first,</p>
<p>and then we can talk about the dark side</p>
<p>and all the things that hopefully</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to avoid entirely</p>
<p>or that you can get yourself out of</p>
<p>once you have the tools in hand.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say somebody tells you something very troubling,</p>
<p>or you look at your phone and you see a text message</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really upsetting to you.</p>
<p>That will cause an immediate increase</p>
<p>in epinephrine, adrenaline, in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And chances are it&rsquo;s going to increase</p>
<p>your levels of cortisol as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower.</p>
<p>Even if you love the cold or if you hate the cold,</p>
<p>that will cause an equivalent increase</p>
<p>in epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact levels,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably about the same.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you go out for high-intensity interval training.</p>
<p>You decide you&rsquo;re going to run some sprints.</p>
<p>You do some repeats,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to do some weightlifting in the gym,</p>
<p>and you love lifting weights in the gym.</p>
<p>Maybe you like the powerlifting thing,</p>
<p>or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga,</p>
<p>or something that you really enjoy or you hate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to increase</p>
<p>your epinephrine and cortisol levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no way around this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you decide to sit down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do some deep breathing.</p>
<p>We all hear about the benefits of deep breathing.</p>
<p>So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get big increases</p>
<p>in epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>The data from multiple studies support this.</p>
<p>All of those are stressors, in air quotes.</p>
<p>Now, there is a way</p>
<p>that you can cognitively reframe what those are.</p>
<p>You can tell yourself,</p>
<p>I love high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>or I love weight training,</p>
<p>or I personally love exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about the cold.</p>
<p>I do some cold exposure stuff now and again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about how to do that</p>
<p>in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>But getting into the cold doesn&rsquo;t feel good to me.</p>
<p>I tell myself it&rsquo;s good for me,</p>
<p>and I enjoy it at some point,</p>
<p>usually when I&rsquo;m getting out.</p>
<p>All of those increase epinephrine,</p>
<p>and guess what?</p>
<p>They increase your levels of energy and alertness.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who struggles</p>
<p>with energy and alertness,</p>
<p>it can be beneficial,</p>
<p>provided you get clearance from your doctor,</p>
<p>to have some sort of protocol built into your day</p>
<p>where you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>and your levels of cortisol.</p>
<p>And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately.</p>
<p>So how would you do that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s quite easy to turn the shower cold</p>
<p>and get into that.</p>
<p>That will wake you up,</p>
<p>and it literally wakes you up</p>
<p>because of increases in epinephrine.</p>
<p>You can do deep breathing of the sort</p>
<p>where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times,</p>
<p>maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exhale,</p>
<p>and then repeat, so-called Wim Hof or Tummo type breathing.</p>
<p>Lots of adrenaline is released into your system</p>
<p>when you do that.</p>
<p>You will have more energy afterwards.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>that the body doesn&rsquo;t distinguish</p>
<p>between a troubling text message, ice,</p>
<p>Tummo breathing, or high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>or any other kind of exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all stress.</p>
<p>Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself,</p>
<p>I like this, I enjoy it,</p>
<p>is not going to change the way</p>
<p>that that molecule impacts your body and brain.</p>
<p>I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you</p>
<p>that all you have to do is say, oh, this is good for me.</p>
<p>No, what it does to tell yourself that it&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>or that you enjoy it is that it liberates other molecules</p>
<p>like dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>that help buffer the epinephrine response.</p>
<p>Now, the way that it does that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about previous episode,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just mention that dopamine</p>
<p>is the precursor to epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, adrenaline, is made from dopamine, okay?</p>
<p>Cortisol is made from cholesterol.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is made from dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why if you tell yourself</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re enjoying something,</p>
<p>and because dopamine is so subjective,</p>
<p>that you can, in some ways,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not completely lying to yourself,</p>
<p>you can get more epinephrine,</p>
<p>you get more mileage or more ability</p>
<p>to push through something,</p>
<p>and you can sort of reframe it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not really cognitive reframing.</p>
<p>The cognitive part is the trigger,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a chemical substance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually occurring there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dopamine giving you more epinephrine,</p>
<p>a bigger amplitude epinephrine release,</p>
<p>and it gives you some sense of control.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a protocol that anyone can use</p>
<p>if you want to increase levels of energy,</p>
<p>if you suffer from low energy during the daytime,</p>
<p>or whenever it is that you&rsquo;d like to be alert.</p>
<p>Pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently,</p>
<p>maybe every day,</p>
<p>but maybe every third day or every fourth day.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s an ice bath or a cold bath.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a cold shower.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the cyclic inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>breathing protocol I described.</p>
<p>If that wasn&rsquo;t clear, and people always ask for a demo,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do the whole thing right now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m willing to do a few rounds of this,</p>
<p>or a few cycles, I should say.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s inhale.</p>
<p>I would do that more deeply,</p>
<p>more like you do that 25, 30 times repeatedly.</p>
<p>You will start to feel warm.</p>
<p>People in the yoga community,</p>
<p>they say you&rsquo;re generating heat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not generating heat, releasing adrenaline.</p>
<p>Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale 25 or 30 times.</p>
<p>You will feel agitated and stressed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re releasing adrenaline in your body,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re releasing norepinephrine</p>
<p>in your brain, and you&rsquo;ll be more alert.</p>
<p>Then you can follow that 25 or 30 breath cycles</p>
<p>with an exhale hold,</p>
<p>and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Always, always, always do this on dry land,</p>
<p>never while driving, operating heavy machinery,</p>
<p>all the standard safety protocols, never near water, please.</p>
<p>People have passed out and died doing this</p>
<p>with breath holds in water.</p>
<p>There are several deaths associated with it.</p>
<p>On land, it&rsquo;s probably safer.</p>
<p>Clear it with your doctor, but 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold.</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold.</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold.</p>
<p>And then if you like, you can do an inhale and hold,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s within your margins of safety.</p>
<p>So if all these protocols,</p>
<p>all these activities are just equivalent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just stress, then how do we make them good for us?</p>
<p>How do we actually benefit from them?</p>
<p>Now, of course, the cold itself</p>
<p>can have some health-promoting effects.</p>
<p>It can increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>or other forms of exercise,</p>
<p>of course, has cardiovascular effects</p>
<p>that can be good for us, as does weight training, et cetera.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain and body</p>
<p>to teach ourselves how to regulate the stress response.</p>
<p>So in addition to the benefits of the actual practices,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about is building a system</p>
<p>so that when you experience increases</p>
<p>in epinephrine and cortisol from life events,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to better buffer those.</p>
<p>And we are also talking about ways</p>
<p>that you can increase energy overall,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what today&rsquo;s episode is all about,</p>
<p>energy and the immune system.</p>
<p>And indeed, we will talk about</p>
<p>how you can actually leverage specific protocols</p>
<p>to increase your immune system on demand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great scientific data to support</p>
<p>that one can do that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a biological mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important if you want to do those things,</p>
<p>increase energy and your immune system on demand,</p>
<p>learn to buffer stress on demand in real time.</p>
<p>And it means taking these protocols,</p>
<p>these practices, whether or not it&rsquo;s cold water</p>
<p>or ice bath or exercise or any of those,</p>
<p>and making one small but very powerful adjustment</p>
<p>in how you perform them.</p>
<p>But in order to make that adjustment,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just tell you the adjustment.</p>
<p>I have to tell you the mechanism</p>
<p>so that you know if you&rsquo;re doing it correctly or not.</p>
<p>This is really a case where if you can understand</p>
<p>a little bit of mechanism,</p>
<p>you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.</p>
<p>So if you take away nothing else from this episode,</p>
<p>except what I&rsquo;m about to tell you,</p>
<p>please take away the information I&rsquo;m about to tell you.</p>
<p>Cortisol, as I mentioned, is released from the adrenals</p>
<p>and it can bind to receptors.</p>
<p>It can have action both in the body and in the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, it can bind the so-called</p>
<p>threat detection center in the brain,</p>
<p>or one of them, which is the amygdala,</p>
<p>also called the fear center.</p>
<p>It can do that because cortisol</p>
<p>can cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>It can be released in the body</p>
<p>and cross this biological barrier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fence that keeps things out of the brain,</p>
<p>but cortisol has passing rights.</p>
<p>It can go through.</p>
<p>Epinephrine cannot.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is polarized.</p>
<p>The shape of it is such that it can&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>through the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>both from the adrenals in your body</p>
<p>and released from this brainstem area,</p>
<p>the locus coeruleus in your brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful thing because what it means</p>
<p>is that the body can enter states of readiness</p>
<p>and alertness while the mind remains calm.</p>
<p>That is biologically possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a psychological trick.</p>
<p>And there are ways that one can do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m presuming at this point</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting your morning light</p>
<p>to time your cortisol increase.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming that you want more energy</p>
<p>or that you want to increase your immune system&rsquo;s function</p>
<p>and its ability to combat infections of various kinds.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m suggesting is that you pick from the palette</p>
<p>of exercises that are out there</p>
<p>or tools that are out there to increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do that.</p>
<p>You can do that, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>through cold water, through exercise.</p>
<p>You can even do that by having confrontations</p>
<p>with other people.</p>
<p>At a biological level, it is identical.</p>
<p>So if you like to go online and place the kind of comments</p>
<p>that will read the kinds of things</p>
<p>or look at the kinds of things that agitate you,</p>
<p>you can, if you like, look at that as an opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see people taking care of themselves</p>
<p>and each other in much less destructive ways, frankly.</p>
<p>But the prerequisite here is getting an increase</p>
<p>in adrenaline released from the body.</p>
<p>Now, the simplest way to describe how to do that</p>
<p>would be in the context of cold water</p>
<p>or a breathing protocol,</p>
<p>because then I don&rsquo;t have to deal</p>
<p>with the unknown life circumstances that get you triggered,</p>
<p>or I could tell you what gets me triggered,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s presume cold water.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you decide you&rsquo;re going to take a cold shower.</p>
<p>You get into the cold shower, and if it&rsquo;s cold enough,</p>
<p>that will be stressful.</p>
<p>You will experience an increase in epinephrine.</p>
<p>It will increase your alertness.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re using this as a practice,</p>
<p>as a tool to build, you could call it resilience,</p>
<p>but the ability to stay calm in the mind</p>
<p>while being stressed in the body,</p>
<p>epinephrine&rsquo;s in the body.</p>
<p>And you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself.</p>
<p>Now, you can do that by telling yourself it&rsquo;s good for you,</p>
<p>by emphasizing your exhales,</p>
<p>anything that you can do to try and stay calm</p>
<p>despite the fact that you are</p>
<p>in a heightened state of alertness.</p>
<p>You do this with exercise, you could do this with music,</p>
<p>pretty much anything that will give you</p>
<p>a really heightened state of alertness</p>
<p>offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to do at a mechanistic level</p>
<p>is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals,</p>
<p>but not have adrenaline epinephrine released</p>
<p>from the brainstem to the same degree.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not just trying to buffer this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to say, oh, this is good for me.</p>
<p>This is good for me, I&rsquo;m going to grind this out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to grind it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to move through this calmly</p>
<p>while maintaining alertness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to zone out necessarily,</p>
<p>although maybe that helps.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to distract yourself.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to do is shift cognitively</p>
<p>your relationship to the somatic,</p>
<p>to the body stress response.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure some of you out there are shouting,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly like whatever, whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>I agree, this is in many ways</p>
<p>a self-directed kind of stress inoculation,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not talking about this as stress inoculation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about this as a way</p>
<p>to increase energy and focus.</p>
<p>And the reason is that epinephrine,</p>
<p>when released in the body,</p>
<p>has a profound effect on the immune system.</p>
<p>And when released in the brain has a profound effect</p>
<p>on the ability to learn and remember information</p>
<p>and to be alert.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re talking about splitting the location,</p>
<p>separating the location from which</p>
<p>you have epinephrine adrenaline released, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you are doing this practice simply to wake up.</p>
<p>Okay, cold shower, we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>Exercise, we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>The ability to stay calm in mind</p>
<p>while having heightened levels of adrenaline</p>
<p>and presumably cortisol as well in the body,</p>
<p>but the cortisol is going to circulate everywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about cortisol more in a moment.</p>
<p>You could do that through some self-soothing, calming way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be highly individual.</p>
<p>You do it by telling yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.</p>
<p>But what you need to understand</p>
<p>is that in the immediate period following that practice,</p>
<p>your system, your entire brain and body are different.</p>
<p>Your body is actually primed to resist infection</p>
<p>when you have high levels of epinephrine in it</p>
<p>for short periods of time.</p>
<p>So the scientific study that explored</p>
<p>how increasing adrenaline in the body</p>
<p>can improve immune resistance</p>
<p>is grounded in a well-known phenomenon</p>
<p>that increases in stress actually protect you</p>
<p>against infection in the short term.</p>
<p>So I want to look at the classic data first,</p>
<p>describe what was done,</p>
<p>and then I want to talk about the more recent study</p>
<p>which is immediately actionable.</p>
<p>There are classic set of studies</p>
<p>that are really based mainly on the work</p>
<p>of somebody named Bruce McEwen</p>
<p>who is at the Rockefeller University in New York.</p>
<p>Bruce passed away a few years ago,</p>
<p>but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work</p>
<p>under his belt when he did.</p>
<p>The work that I&rsquo;m going to talk about next</p>
<p>has been done in humans and has been done in animals</p>
<p>and has really explored how inducing stress</p>
<p>can enhance the function of the immune system</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>And when I mean short term, I mean about one to four days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go through all the details of the study,</p>
<p>but essentially what they were doing</p>
<p>was exposing subjects to some sort of infection,</p>
<p>either bacterial or viral infection, and inducing stress.</p>
<p>Sounds like a double whammy, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that maybe getting a little electric shock</p>
<p>or cold water exposure</p>
<p>or something to increase your levels of stress</p>
<p>and adrenaline would just make</p>
<p>the effects of the infection worse,</p>
<p>but no, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Brief bouts of stress,</p>
<p>which now you should be thinking about</p>
<p>in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release,</p>
<p>were actually able to increase immune system function.</p>
<p>Now, that shouldn&rsquo;t surprise you</p>
<p>if you understand a little bit</p>
<p>about how epinephrine works in the body and in the brain.</p>
<p>It essentially is the signal</p>
<p>by which the nervous system can inform immune organs,</p>
<p>things like the spleen and other organs</p>
<p>that make killer cells of various kinds,</p>
<p>B cells and T cells,</p>
<p>to go and combat infections, bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>How else would your immune system know</p>
<p>that there was an infection?</p>
<p>Your immune system can recognize foreign invaders,</p>
<p>but the nervous system provides the signal,</p>
<p>the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells,</p>
<p>that tells them there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>and to go seek out the problem, so to speak.</p>
<p>So the duration here is really important</p>
<p>because if stress stayed too high for too long,</p>
<p>then yes, indeed, stress can hinder the immune response,</p>
<p>but for a period of about one to four days,</p>
<p>it actually can protect you</p>
<p>by way of increasing the immune response.</p>
<p>Now, I can say with certainty</p>
<p>that that effect is governed by epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline released from the adrenals</p>
<p>and not from the brain</p>
<p>because they actually explored</p>
<p>whether or not the effect exists</p>
<p>in the presence of what&rsquo;s called an adrenalectomy</p>
<p>or removing the adrenals.</p>
<p>So I should just say,</p>
<p>without the adrenals, you don&rsquo;t get the effect.</p>
<p>So we know that that effect</p>
<p>comes from adrenaline in the body.</p>
<p>What does that mean for you?</p>
<p>That means if you want to increase your immune system</p>
<p>in the short term,</p>
<p>you want to increase your epinephrine in the short term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why short bouts of very intense exercise,</p>
<p>probably no more than an hour per day,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re doing everything else right,</p>
<p>sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,</p>
<p>maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise</p>
<p>or exposure to cold water</p>
<p>or the cyclic breathing that I talked about before,</p>
<p>because they increase epinephrine,</p>
<p>they will bolster the immune system.</p>
<p>And we all hear these reports every once in a while,</p>
<p>seems to be the thing that every once in a while,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be an article about how coffee</p>
<p>can improve your immune system or something like that.</p>
<p>Indeed, caffeine can increase epinephrine</p>
<p>and dopamine to some extent,</p>
<p>but most people are drinking it chronically.</p>
<p>So its effects are probably due to increases in epinephrine</p>
<p>and probably whether or not something like coffee</p>
<p>or other forms of caffeine can improve</p>
<p>or degrade your immune system</p>
<p>will probably depend on whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using it in a way that it increases your adrenaline</p>
<p>as a spike that happens rarely,</p>
<p>once every two or three months,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have an infection coming on.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, what these data probably mean</p>
<p>is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea</p>
<p>or some hot coffee even,</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t get dehydrated from it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also drinking some water</p>
<p>can probably improve your immune system function</p>
<p>by way of increasing adrenaline release.</p>
<p>But so can the breathing, so can cold exposure,</p>
<p>so can exercise.</p>
<p>The mechanism here is what&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>And I keep saying that because what it means</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t actually have to know</p>
<p>the specific protocol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to say do this particular protocol.</p>
<p>You have to figure out,</p>
<p>and it should be easy to figure out</p>
<p>what short-term adrenaline increasing behavior</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to do on a regular basis every day</p>
<p>or two or three times a week.</p>
<p>Now you could say, well, I&rsquo;m not sick.</p>
<p>Should I be doing these things often?</p>
<p>I would say two or three times a week at a minimum</p>
<p>if your goal is to keep your immune system tuned up</p>
<p>and you are in the presence of a lot of children,</p>
<p>for instance, which carry a lot of bugs</p>
<p>because their immune system isn&rsquo;t developed,</p>
<p>or you work in a healthcare setting,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re simply somebody who&rsquo;s prone to get sick.</p>
<p>I can just say anecdotally,</p>
<p>I guess someone now calls this anic data,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t like that phrase</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anecdotal data to ever be misunderstood</p>
<p>as anything but anecdotal data.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I can say that I&rsquo;ve had instances</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve felt a throat tickle coming on</p>
<p>or some sinus infection.</p>
<p>I will do the cyclic breathing that I described before,</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,</p>
<p>and then big inhale, hold.</p>
<p>And most times I didn&rsquo;t get full-blown sick,</p>
<p>but I also take other precautionary measures</p>
<p>to get sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whether or not it was causal</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s just correlated, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a human study</p>
<p>that I definitely want to point out to you</p>
<p>because it was published more recently</p>
<p>than the McEwen work.</p>
<p>It was published in the Proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences for the USA</p>
<p>because there are Proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>for many other countries as well.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>A Voluntary Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the system that causes fight or flight,</p>
<p>and AKA stress, and causes release of adrenaline.</p>
<p>An attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.</p>
<p>This is Cox, K-O-X et al., P-N-A-S,</p>
<p>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2014.</p>
<p>And they incorporate the ever-famous Wim Hof breathing.</p>
<p>Wim Hof breathing is much like the breathing protocol</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve described several times now in this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also called Tummo breathing.</p>
<p>Other people from other cultures and communities</p>
<p>have called it other things.</p>
<p>The naming really isn&rsquo;t important,</p>
<p>although I do think Wim is a pioneer</p>
<p>in trying to bring these practices</p>
<p>to the general public more broadly,</p>
<p>and was involved in this study.</p>
<p>The study was done in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It was communicated by Dr. Thomas Horvath at Yale.</p>
<p>I mention all that.</p>
<p>Horvath is a terrific scientist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with his work over many years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>They injected people with E. coli,</p>
<p>and they had groups that either did</p>
<p>the sorts of breathing I&rsquo;ve been describing,</p>
<p>that increased adrenaline release,</p>
<p>although I should say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need that breathing</p>
<p>to get adrenaline release.</p>
<p>You could do it with cold exposure.</p>
<p>You could do it with other things,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training as well.</p>
<p>And what they found was that the response to the E. coli</p>
<p>was quite different in the people that had a protocol,</p>
<p>in this case, breathing, to increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>So this is a remarkable study</p>
<p>because what they found was that the fever,</p>
<p>the vomiting, all the negative effects of E. coli,</p>
<p>many of them, and in some cases, all of them,</p>
<p>were greatly attenuated</p>
<p>by way of engaging the adrenaline system,</p>
<p>in this case, using breathing.</p>
<p>They looked at inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>things like IL-6,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve mentioned many times on this podcast,</p>
<p>the sort of classic inflammatory cytokine were reduced.</p>
<p>Things like IL-10, which are anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>were increased.</p>
<p>There were some inflammatory cytokines that were increased.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point here?</p>
<p>The point is you can control your immune system</p>
<p>by finding a way that you can increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>And this runs counter to what we always hear,</p>
<p>which is don&rsquo;t get too stressed or you will get sick.</p>
<p>Learn to control adrenaline.</p>
<p>Turn it on and turn it off.</p>
<p>Learn to control cortisol.</p>
<p>Turn it on with light in the morning,</p>
<p>try and turn it off.</p>
<p>And then when it spikes because of life events,</p>
<p>learn to turn it off.</p>
<p>Learning to turn on and off adrenaline, aka epinephrine,</p>
<p>and learning to turn on and off cortisol</p>
<p>affords you the ability to turn on energy</p>
<p>and focus in your immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important point from today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>And understanding that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what protocol you use.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and running up a hill five or six times.</p>
<p>That will improve your immune system function</p>
<p>if you get adrenaline in your system.</p>
<p>You can use an ice bath.</p>
<p>You can use a cold bath.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You can get into an argument,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do that.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is that you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to then shut off that response.</p>
<p>And there are ways to do that we will talk about,</p>
<p>but I want to talk about some of the other benefits</p>
<p>of epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>that occur because of their actions on the brain,</p>
<p>because these are many and they are powerful</p>
<p>and they relate to energy, but also the ability to learn.</p>
<p>If I haven&rsquo;t already convinced you</p>
<p>that seeing light early in the day</p>
<p>is good for timing your cortisol,</p>
<p>I should also mention that another hormone</p>
<p>that I discussed last episode, which is thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s critical for setting your level of metabolism,</p>
<p>is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms</p>
<p>and cortisol itself.</p>
<p>The short takeaway on this is that</p>
<p>if you get your cortisol release early in the day,</p>
<p>it will increase your energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>It will also time your thyroid release properly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s yet another reason why you would want</p>
<p>to get that light exposure early in the day.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s a non-negotiable practice.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m on a plane, I&rsquo;ll try and get it any way I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not shining flashlights in my eyes yet,</p>
<p>but I really try hard to get that light exposure</p>
<p>from sunlight early in the day without fail.</p>
<p>And the thyroid increase has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that your circadian clock itself is regulated by cortisol</p>
<p>and the circadian clock times the release</p>
<p>of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go too far off in that direction,</p>
<p>but there are a number of studies,</p>
<p>Calsbeek et al, K-A-L-S-B-E-E-K et al,</p>
<p>2012, if you want to look it up on PubMed,</p>
<p>is a great one that describes how cortisol secretion</p>
<p>begins to rise during sleep and peaks shortly after waking</p>
<p>or immediately before.</p>
<p>And that times a set of neurons in the circadian clock</p>
<p>that then trigger the release of the releasing</p>
<p>and stimulating hormones for thyroid.</p>
<p>So a really important mechanism.</p>
<p>And thyroid will also tend to correlate with energy,</p>
<p>but mostly metabolism.</p>
<p>Very important to have thyroid in check.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>and learning and memory.</p>
<p>Everyone has a story about being so stressed</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t remember something.</p>
<p>You know, sit down to an exam.</p>
<p>I actually had this happen once,</p>
<p>sat down to an exam and just blanked, just blanked.</p>
<p>It only happened once.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>but I just completely blanked.</p>
<p>And it was very hard for me to pull myself</p>
<p>out of that ditch.</p>
<p>I did manage to do it, but it was a scary experience.</p>
<p>So I think most people think about stress</p>
<p>and an inability to perform.</p>
<p>However, most of the time increases in epinephrine,</p>
<p>provided they are not through the roof,</p>
<p>lead to improved performance.</p>
<p>Now this has been shown over and over again</p>
<p>on memory tests, on learning new information,</p>
<p>on physical performance,</p>
<p>that when blood levels of epinephrine are low,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t perform very well.</p>
<p>When blood levels of epinephrine are very high,</p>
<p>up to about 1,500 to 1,700 picograms per mil,</p>
<p>if anyone&rsquo;s out there who&rsquo;s actually measuring this stuff,</p>
<p>but I doubt you are, performance goes way up.</p>
<p>Performance gets better when you are alert</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re a little bit stressed.</p>
<p>Absolutely shown again and again and again.</p>
<p>If you get too stressed, it&rsquo;s the mental side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the epinephrine in the brain that causes people</p>
<p>to either focus on their somatic response too much,</p>
<p>like they feel like they&rsquo;re sweating</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re focused on their bodily response</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not focused on what it is they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>or say or perform, et cetera, or learn.</p>
<p>But epinephrine is a nootropic,</p>
<p>it is a smart drug that we all make internally.</p>
<p>And cortisol is as well.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the twist.</p>
<p>That does not mean that you want epinephrine high</p>
<p>during the exam necessarily.</p>
<p>Memory and learning and performance are actually favored,</p>
<p>they are enhanced by epinephrine increases</p>
<p>immediately after learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s rarely discussed,</p>
<p>the timing is vital.</p>
<p>So if you learn some information, you have a conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>the increase in epinephrine that occurs just afterward</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s going to consolidate the information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to ensure that the proper circuits</p>
<p>and mechanisms in the brain for neuroplasticity</p>
<p>are engaged during sleep later that night or the next night,</p>
<p>which is when the real rewiring occurs.</p>
<p>And you might say, that&rsquo;s crazy, why would that happen?</p>
<p>Well, we have to remember,</p>
<p>none of these mechanisms evolved</p>
<p>for us to do what we want</p>
<p>and learn what we want necessarily,</p>
<p>although they will allow us to do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve experienced this before.</p>
<p>We might&rsquo;ve gotten up, gone outside, get in our car,</p>
<p>drive to work or to somebody&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking about much at all,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you see an accident on the road.</p>
<p>Your alertness is primed</p>
<p>if it happens to be a particularly gory accident,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of sensory information there,</p>
<p>all of a sudden adrenaline, epinephrine</p>
<p>is released into your brain and body.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Not only will you not forget that event,</p>
<p>but you will remember everything that led up to that event,</p>
<p>which has an adaptive function</p>
<p>because your brain and body&rsquo;s primary concern is safety.</p>
<p>This is the neurobiological explanation</p>
<p>for Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs is safety first.</p>
<p>And so you have heightened awareness and alertness</p>
<p>for everything that preceded</p>
<p>that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.</p>
<p>So the way to think about this is</p>
<p>if you need to learn something better,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking Adderall</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking a lot of coffee beforehand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually driving the process in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re increasing epinephrine for learning, sure,</p>
<p>but past a certain point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually degrading learning and performance.</p>
<p>The time to do that is toward the end</p>
<p>or immediately after the learning</p>
<p>because this mechanism is not simply devoted</p>
<p>to negative events like a car crash or a trauma,</p>
<p>it works to make sure that the hippocampus</p>
<p>that encodes memories</p>
<p>as part of the memory encoding mechanisms</p>
<p>is primed that it&rsquo;s told</p>
<p>what you just experienced is important,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need that information later.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve talked many times before</p>
<p>about using non-sleep deep rest, NSDR,</p>
<p>or ensuring good night&rsquo;s sleep after learning,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;re also talking about</p>
<p>is as the learning event tapers off,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re exiting that,</p>
<p>to make sure that your epinephrine levels</p>
<p>are not tapering off as well.</p>
<p>And this may be one of the reasons</p>
<p>why the 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>the so-called ultradian cycle for learning,</p>
<p>works because it takes a few minutes</p>
<p>to get into rhythm of learning.</p>
<p>You can maintain that alertness for about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that these podcasts</p>
<p>are typically about 90 minutes long.</p>
<p>And as you exit that 90 minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start to feel fatigued.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to continue</p>
<p>to secrete epinephrine at the same level.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not telling you that at the end of this podcast,</p>
<p>you should give yourself a foot shock</p>
<p>or that you should jump into an ice bath.</p>
<p>Although I will say if you were to increase</p>
<p>your epinephrine at the end of this episode</p>
<p>by breathing or by way of cold shower,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet based on numerous published studies</p>
<p>that the memory for the information would be enhanced</p>
<p>because of this retroactive effect</p>
<p>of epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>Put simply, you can remember things better</p>
<p>if you increase your alertness,</p>
<p>aka your level of epinephrine and cortisol after,</p>
<p>immediately after something that you want to learn.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>that the optimal strategy therefore would be</p>
<p>a 90 minute session of focus or learning,</p>
<p>then immediately after cold shower or Tumo type breathing</p>
<p>or ice bath or something of that sort,</p>
<p>maybe a hard run or hit training</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t get access to the other things,</p>
<p>and then shower up and do a non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>and then get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Those would be the optimal tools</p>
<p>and the organization of tools for enhanced learning.</p>
<p>And of course you could use caffeine</p>
<p>to prime the whole process by drinking the caffeine</p>
<p>towards the tail of the learning episode,</p>
<p>which is counterintuitive, at least to me.</p>
<p>I should mention, since many of you use caffeine</p>
<p>and I use caffeine, I do drink coffee.</p>
<p>I love mushroom coffee.</p>
<p>I love mate.</p>
<p>I drink caffeine in various forms.</p>
<p>That there was a study that came out recently</p>
<p>that is relevant to our discussion about energy</p>
<p>and alertness and learning.</p>
<p>And the study came out just recently in March, 2021.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Maghalas et al.</p>
<p>So M-A-G-A-L-H-A-E-S.</p>
<p>And it was published in Molecular Psychiatry,</p>
<p>which is a fine journal, a peer review journal.</p>
<p>And the title pretty much gives it away.</p>
<p>Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern</p>
<p>of brain functional connectivity.</p>
<p>Chronically drinking coffee changes brain connectivity.</p>
<p>And it does it in a number of ways,</p>
<p>but the key takeaways from this study</p>
<p>as it relates to sort of what the circuits do,</p>
<p>as opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits,</p>
<p>which is kind of meaningless in this conversation,</p>
<p>is that people who drank coffee habitually every day</p>
<p>had changes in their brain circuitry</p>
<p>such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety,</p>
<p>even when they don&rsquo;t ingest caffeine.</p>
<p>So a lot of times we think,</p>
<p>oh, caffeine increases your levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>And indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically,</p>
<p>but not just to caffeine.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just raise your baseline of anxiety</p>
<p>because of what&rsquo;s circulating in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>It actually increases connectivity</p>
<p>between the brain areas that relate to anxiety.</p>
<p>Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing,</p>
<p>depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>For people that are prone to chronic panic attacks</p>
<p>or anxiety attacks, that&rsquo;s not going to be good.</p>
<p>Some people might use caffeine in healthy ways.</p>
<p>I believe I do in order to just increase</p>
<p>overall levels of alertness.</p>
<p>Although now, not only am I going to start</p>
<p>delaying my caffeine intake till two hours after I wake up</p>
<p>for reasons I&rsquo;ve talked about in previous episodes,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also going to start drinking it later</p>
<p>in learning and focus sessions as a way to enhance</p>
<p>plasticity around those learning and focus sessions,</p>
<p>not before.</p>
<p>So interesting study, feel free to, it&rsquo;s free online.</p>
<p>You can access the full paper online.</p>
<p>We will put a link as well.</p>
<p>I want to mention this issue of nootropic,</p>
<p>so-called smart drugs,</p>
<p>which is not a topic that I particularly enjoy</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the name.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea of a nootropic</p>
<p>because what is a smart drug?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different kinds of smart.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s creativity, there&rsquo;s task switching,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s strategy building, there&rsquo;s strategy implementation.</p>
<p>And most of the nootropics that are out there</p>
<p>are just cocktails of a bunch of different things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t tailored to the individual at all.</p>
<p>They all seem to have some caffeine</p>
<p>or some cholinergic stimulation, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an important way to frame this</p>
<p>in light of today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Nootropics generally fall into two categories.</p>
<p>One category are nootropics that increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>So these are compounds that people take</p>
<p>that increase blood glucose</p>
<p>and increasing blood glucose will improve performance</p>
<p>and can enhance learning in some situations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting people take these things,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s just a list of a few of those.</p>
<p>Some of them are legal, some of them are gray market,</p>
<p>some of them are illegal.</p>
<p>Paracetams, oxiracetams, the aniracetams, all the tams,</p>
<p>okay, elevate blood glucose, that&rsquo;s how they work.</p>
<p>The neural effects that you hear are secondary or tertiary</p>
<p>to the fact that they just increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>We know that because if you block the blood glucose effect,</p>
<p>you block the nootropic effect, okay?</p>
<p>Others include, and definitely don&rsquo;t take these, please,</p>
<p>amphetamine, cocaine, those will increase learning</p>
<p>in the short term in particular dosages,</p>
<p>but because they increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>And then of course, things like painful stimuli or stress</p>
<p>will improve learning by way of increasing blood glucose.</p>
<p>Now, stress and epinephrine that&rsquo;s associated with it,</p>
<p>not only improve performance during the learning bout,</p>
<p>but as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>having epinephrine come up afterward</p>
<p>will increase the retention of that information</p>
<p>in the long-term.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s a whole category</p>
<p>of nootropics that don&rsquo;t impact blood glucose</p>
<p>that work by increasing the cholinergic system activity.</p>
<p>And these are things like choline, lecithin,</p>
<p>fosostigmine, it&rsquo;s a prescription drug,</p>
<p>fosodilosterine.</p>
<p>So there are ways to increase energy</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require increasing blood glucose.</p>
<p>And this is vitally important.</p>
<p>The reason we&rsquo;re talking about epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>for increasing energy and immune system function</p>
<p>is because they are largely independent of blood glucose.</p>
<p>Of course, they interact with that system,</p>
<p>but we heard so much growing up, you need to eat for energy,</p>
<p>but the energy that we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>is actually a much more powerful one</p>
<p>than the one that you derive from food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we could call it neural energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neurotransmitters that create alertness and focus</p>
<p>and the willingness and the ability to move</p>
<p>and the willingness and ability for immune system</p>
<p>to move in response to intruders.</p>
<p>So I think we all too often think about food as energy,</p>
<p>which is great because it is,</p>
<p>but there are other sources of energy that are neural</p>
<p>and they relate to these hormone systems,</p>
<p>cortisol and epinephrine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re focused on today.</p>
<p>So up until now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about increasing energy</p>
<p>and increasing the immune system</p>
<p>by way of cortisol and epinephrine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be totally remiss if I didn&rsquo;t cover</p>
<p>how cortisol and epinephrine,</p>
<p>if chronically elevated or if elevated too high,</p>
<p>can have a lot of detrimental effects.</p>
<p>These are the things we normally hear about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe some of those things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them,</p>
<p>ways that you can adjust the cortisol levels,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>ways that you can adjust epinephrine levels,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>so that they have less of a negative impact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to list off all the ways that stress</p>
<p>is terrible and chronic stress is terrible.</p>
<p>I think you know.</p>
<p>Insomnia, your immune system over time will get battered</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be able to fight infection off as well.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be stressed for too long.</p>
<p>You can start laying down the sort of classic pattern</p>
<p>of cortisol-induced body fat.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a whole literature</p>
<p>related to comfort foods</p>
<p>and why we want to consume comfort foods</p>
<p>under conditions of chronic stress.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite interesting actually,</p>
<p>because it reveals something</p>
<p>about the biology of chronic stress</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s informative for how to prevent it</p>
<p>or to down-regulate chronic stress once it&rsquo;s occurred.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk for a second about comfort foods.</p>
<p>And the work that I&rsquo;m going to refer to</p>
<p>is work that was done by a very impressive scientist</p>
<p>by the name of Mary Dahlman.</p>
<p>Her work goes back decades.</p>
<p>She was at University of California, San Francisco.</p>
<p>And she asked this question</p>
<p>that on the face of it seems kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but for which there was no mechanism known</p>
<p>until Mary and her lab personnel came along.</p>
<p>And the question was, why do we seek high-fat</p>
<p>and or high-sugar foods when we are stressed for a while?</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>And the reason is that the so-called glucocorticoids,</p>
<p>of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid,</p>
<p>is caused, as we&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>by releasing hormones from the brain,</p>
<p>NACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.</p>
<p>But normally high levels of glucocorticoids</p>
<p>shut off the releasing hormones in the brain</p>
<p>and in the pituitary.</p>
<p>They shut down in a so-called negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>So just like if testosterone or estrogen get too high,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s read out or that is seen, so to speak,</p>
<p>by neurons in the pituitary and brain,</p>
<p>and then we shut down our production</p>
<p>of estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>If cortisol levels get too high,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s too much cortisol</p>
<p>floating around in our bloodstream,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a negative feedback loop</p>
<p>and the brain and pituitary shut down CRH and ACTH,</p>
<p>which would otherwise stimulate more cortisol.</p>
<p>So cortisol levels go down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a beautiful negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>Chronic stress, however,</p>
<p>stress that lasts more than four to seven days,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a way to think about what chronic stress</p>
<p>really is in an actionable way,</p>
<p>causes changes in the feedback loop</p>
<p>between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary</p>
<p>such that now the brain and the pituitary</p>
<p>respond to high levels of glucocorticoids, cortisol,</p>
<p>by releasing more of them,</p>
<p>it becomes a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation</p>
<p>and transcription and translation.</p>
<p>And so you really don&rsquo;t want chronic stress</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a cascade of stress equals more stress</p>
<p>equals more stress.</p>
<p>So this is why it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to learn to turn off the stress response.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it elevated for too long.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one study that Dahlman and her colleagues did</p>
<p>where they stimulate chronic stress</p>
<p>by increasing corticosterone cortisol.</p>
<p>And they found that subjects</p>
<p>would increase their consumption of sugar and fat.</p>
<p>In fact, they would even eat lard.</p>
<p>It would just, it sounds disgusting,</p>
<p>but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar.</p>
<p>And that led to all sorts of things like type two diabetes,</p>
<p>led to dysfunction in the adrenal output, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so the real key is to learn</p>
<p>to shut off the stress response.</p>
<p>Because the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>is that Dahlman and colleagues</p>
<p>and some studies that followed up on their work</p>
<p>found that if the system was kicked into motion</p>
<p>for too long,</p>
<p>then there was a tremendous shift overall towards anxiety</p>
<p>because it turns out that body fat itself</p>
<p>receives neural innervation.</p>
<p>It received, neurons actually talk to body fat.</p>
<p>So now you have body fat releasing certain hormones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the adrenals releasing cortisol.</p>
<p>And all of that is feeding back to the brain</p>
<p>to make you want more sugar and fatty foods.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the so-called comfort foods work.</p>
<p>And you should watch yourself</p>
<p>next time you experience stress.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a short-term bout of stress,</p>
<p>typically it blocks hunger.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a longer bout of stress,</p>
<p>typically it triggers hunger</p>
<p>in particular for these so-called comfort foods,</p>
<p>sugary and fatty foods.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting how short-term stress</p>
<p>can actually block hunger.</p>
<p>It does that by activating or interacting with a system</p>
<p>called the Bombicin system.</p>
<p>Bombicin is a peptide hormone.</p>
<p>It was actually, I think it was named</p>
<p>after some sort of reptile or amphibian, excuse me,</p>
<p>some sort of toad.</p>
<p>I think it was initially sequenced from the toad</p>
<p>before it was later discovered in humans.</p>
<p>And I think the toad&rsquo;s Latin name is Bombina bombina</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>And so they decided to call this thing Bombicin,</p>
<p>but it reduces eating and stress liberates Bombicin</p>
<p>and makes you want to eat less.</p>
<p>But chronic stress causes all these positive feedback</p>
<p>changes, which are not positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re positive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling them positive because they amplify</p>
<p>the stress response over and over,</p>
<p>not because they are good for you.</p>
<p>So short-term stress, great.</p>
<p>Long-term stress, really, really bad.</p>
<p>Other bad effects of stress that we can talk about.</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t list off too many more of these</p>
<p>because you know so many of them, you hear about them.</p>
<p>You really want to know how to control them, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>is that yes, indeed, stress can make you go gray.</p>
<p>The rates at which people go gray, meaning gray hair,</p>
<p>some cases gray body hair as well,</p>
<p>depend on some genetic factors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, there are a couple of ways</p>
<p>that we can go gray.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a stem cell,</p>
<p>what they call niche in every follicle.</p>
<p>So you have stem cells in the follicle</p>
<p>that can produce more and more of the given hair cell.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re actually peroxide groups.</p>
<p>You know, we hear about bleaching hair with peroxide,</p>
<p>at least in the 80s, that was a thing.</p>
<p>But you can use hydrogen peroxide to bleach things</p>
<p>and you can produce your own peroxide in the hair follicle</p>
<p>that will cause the hairs to go gray.</p>
<p>In addition, pigmentation of hair,</p>
<p>just like pigmentation of skin, is controlled by melanocytes.</p>
<p>Our old friends, the melanocytes.</p>
<p>And I say old friends because on previous episodes,</p>
<p>I talked about why sunlight and getting ample sunlight</p>
<p>can increase levels of certain things</p>
<p>like melanocytes stimulating hormone, which reduce hunger.</p>
<p>It can improve testosterone and estrogen levels</p>
<p>and all the reasons for that.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that activation</p>
<p>of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is really just another name for the system</p>
<p>that liberates adrenaline from the adrenals</p>
<p>and epinephrine in the brain,</p>
<p>drives depletion of melanocytes in hair stem cells.</p>
<p>So indeed there&rsquo;s a rate of aging</p>
<p>that we will undergo based on our genetics,</p>
<p>but stress will make us go gray.</p>
<p>And the paper that you should look to</p>
<p>if you want to read more about this came out very recently.</p>
<p>This is Zhang et al, Z-H-A-N-G et al,</p>
<p>Nature, fabulous journal,</p>
<p>definitely one of the apex journals, 2020.</p>
<p>So this paper showed that the activation of stress</p>
<p>in various forms will deplete these melanocyte stem cells.</p>
<p>You do not have to worry about an ice bath</p>
<p>or hard exercise or breathing,</p>
<p>increasing your levels of stress</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s going to make you go gray.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking again about chronic stress.</p>
<p>And if you want to offset the stress effects</p>
<p>on graying of hair,</p>
<p>you can do that by either having a practice</p>
<p>that helps you regulate stress on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>So something like non-sleep deep rest or meditation.</p>
<p>If you can get access to massages or vacations,</p>
<p>those are great, but having a practice</p>
<p>to keep stress clamped so that it&rsquo;s not chronically elevated,</p>
<p>that will be great as well.</p>
<p>This is another case where sunlight,</p>
<p>we know stimulates melanocytes,</p>
<p>not just in skin, but in hair.</p>
<p>And so getting ample sunlight,</p>
<p>having a practice to regulate stress</p>
<p>will offset the stress-induced graying of hairs</p>
<p>by way of stress-induced depletion of melanocytes.</p>
<p>And if melanocyte sounds a lot like melanin, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because anything involved with pigmentation</p>
<p>in the brain and body generally has melano</p>
<p>in the front of the word in some way or another.</p>
<p>So if chronic stress is so bad</p>
<p>because of its effects on epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>being elevated for too long,</p>
<p>then the question becomes, of course,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s chronic stress?</p>
<p>How do I know the difference</p>
<p>between chronic and acute stress</p>
<p>and how do I keep chronic stress at bay</p>
<p>because of all these negative effects?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even list out the number of other ones,</p>
<p>the effects on depression,</p>
<p>which certainly has a correlate with elevated cortisol.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone associated with,</p>
<p>low thyroid hormone is associated with depression,</p>
<p>mistimed thyroid.</p>
<p>Once again, getting your light and your feeding</p>
<p>and your exercise and your sleep</p>
<p>on a consistent schedule or consistent-ish</p>
<p>is going to be the most powerful thing you can do</p>
<p>in order to buffer yourself against negative effects</p>
<p>on mental health and physical health for that matter.</p>
<p>There are things that one can take,</p>
<p>supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.</p>
<p>Some of you out there may have</p>
<p>or may know people that have Cushing&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is chronically elevated cortisol.</p>
<p>There are prescription drugs that we will talk about</p>
<p>that can be used.</p>
<p>But most people are dealing with a situation</p>
<p>where life gets stressful, then less stressful,</p>
<p>stressful, then less stressful.</p>
<p>I would say based on the data from McEwen and others,</p>
<p>Bob Sapolsky&rsquo;s lab over many years,</p>
<p>I would say any stress that lasts more than a day</p>
<p>or two days or three days</p>
<p>is starting to become chronic stress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no strict cutoff</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not measuring everybody&rsquo;s cortisol</p>
<p>from moment to moment.</p>
<p>My lab has done experiments</p>
<p>where we measure stress in people over time.</p>
<p>People vary tremendously in their ability</p>
<p>to have a really hard day and then fall deeply asleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the ultimate reset</p>
<p>is the ability to sleep well,</p>
<p>more or less undisturbed each night,</p>
<p>although one or two wake-ups during the night</p>
<p>probably not going to be too detrimental</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re not too long</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not viewing light</p>
<p>during those wake-ups or your phone.</p>
<p>But the things that you can take</p>
<p>if you feel like you&rsquo;re chronically stressed</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re veering toward</p>
<p>some of the negative effects of stress are many.</p>
<p>There are some simple things that people can do</p>
<p>in terms of supplementation.</p>
<p>All supplements, of course,</p>
<p>have to be checked out for their safety margins for you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to differ from person to person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for making sure they&rsquo;re safe for you</p>
<p>if you decide to use them.</p>
<p>One of the most common ones is ashwagandha</p>
<p>and it has a powerful anxiolytic, anti-anxiety effect.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to go to examine.com</p>
<p>and for zero cost,</p>
<p>you can see their so-called human effect matrix.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha has many uses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been used to enhance power output in athletes.</p>
<p>It has been shown to modestly increase testosterone.</p>
<p>It has been shown to modestly adjust things</p>
<p>like low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,</p>
<p>the so-called bad cholesterol, in quotes.</p>
<p>It has a profound effect on anxiety.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown in nine studies,</p>
<p>nine peer-reviewed independent studies,</p>
<p>I mean, funded by organizations</p>
<p>that have no vested interest in the answer.</p>
<p>It has a very strong effect on cortisol itself.</p>
<p>How strong?</p>
<p>The decrease in cortisol noted in humans</p>
<p>is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction in otherwise healthy</p>
<p>but stressed humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Six studies, and it mentions this is significantly larger</p>
<p>than many other supplements.</p>
<p>Now, some people will say that taking ashwagandha</p>
<p>chronically may not be good.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard about that,</p>
<p>or you can point to specific studies</p>
<p>that indicate exactly why it&rsquo;s not good,</p>
<p>please put it in the comment section or let me know.</p>
<p>In the comment section on YouTube would be best.</p>
<p>The studies that I&rsquo;m referring to did explore both genders.</p>
<p>The number of subjects was reasonably high, 64 or more.</p>
<p>One to six months studies,</p>
<p>so these were long-term studies, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d like to see that, not just an acute study.</p>
<p>So males and females, lots of different ages,</p>
<p>overweight and non-overweight.</p>
<p>They did blood draws of cortisol,</p>
<p>which is going to end as well as saliva tests.</p>
<p>Saliva is actually the best way to measure free cortisol.</p>
<p>You can also measure it from earwax, it turns out,</p>
<p>which sounds pretty gross and kind of is,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, that&rsquo;s where cortisol will accumulate</p>
<p>in earwax and in saliva, the free cortisol.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s six very quality studies,</p>
<p>independently supported that all points</p>
<p>to these very significant, you know,</p>
<p>14.5 to 27.9% reductions in otherwise healthy adults.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who is dealing with chronic stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a stressful period in your life,</p>
<p>and you want to stave off the negative effects of stress,</p>
<p>well then, ashwagandha may,</p>
<p>I want to highlight may, be right for you.</p>
<p>It also does tend to lower total cortisol,</p>
<p>which is interesting,</p>
<p>can lower depression to a somewhat minimal degree.</p>
<p>And can lower, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>things like low-density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>So that, I think ashwagandha comes through</p>
<p>as kind of the heavy hitter in this department.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting also is the other effects</p>
<p>of ashwagandha that are downstream</p>
<p>of reducing chronic stress and cortisol,</p>
<p>because cortisol has so many effects.</p>
<p>There are receptors for cortisol</p>
<p>all over the body and brain.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll just list these off quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to list off each study</p>
<p>or talk about how many subjects in detail.</p>
<p>Again, you can go to examine.com if you want</p>
<p>and just put in ashwagandha.</p>
<p>C-reactive protein, which is a marker</p>
<p>of all sorts of negative health effects,</p>
<p>cardiovascular health, even macular degeneration,</p>
<p>is notably reduced.</p>
<p>Heart palpitations, notably reduced.</p>
<p>Serum T3 and T4, our old friends,</p>
<p>the thyroid hormones from a previous episode, are increased.</p>
<p>Symptoms of OCD, decreased.</p>
<p>Both the obsessions and the compulsions, right?</p>
<p>Obsessions are of the mind, compulsions are of behavior.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things that are downstream</p>
<p>of reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>Lowered heart rate, lowered rates of insomnia,</p>
<p>slightly improved memory.</p>
<p>Why that would be, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because cortisol in the short term can increase memory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s from increased sleep.</p>
<p>Decreased pain, increased quality,</p>
<p>decreased reaction times, things of that sort.</p>
<p>So the list goes on and on,</p>
<p>but all of those things stem downstream</p>
<p>of decreased cortisol.</p>
<p>So if one were to decide to take ashwagandha</p>
<p>in order to reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>given that you want cortisol early in the day</p>
<p>to have energy throughout the day,</p>
<p>the time to take it is probably later in the day</p>
<p>or in the evening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of it preventing sleep</p>
<p>or causing insomnia of any kind.</p>
<p>That certainly wasn&rsquo;t listed as one of the major effects</p>
<p>on examine.com.</p>
<p>I will take ashwagandha from time to time</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m chronically stressed</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m not sleeping as well as I ought to.</p>
<p>You might think that with all my knowledge</p>
<p>about sleep and sleep protocols</p>
<p>that I would sleep perfectly every night,</p>
<p>but unfortunately I have a dog</p>
<p>that has a canine form of sundowners of dementia.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s up much of the night these days.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m getting a solid night</p>
<p>of sleep lately.</p>
<p>And so I will supplement with ashwagandha</p>
<p>and typically I&rsquo;ll take it before sleep</p>
<p>and maybe also with my last meal of the day,</p>
<p>which is at least two hours before I go to sleep.</p>
<p>Again, you have to decide if it&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>The dosages can vary tremendously.</p>
<p>I would just go by what&rsquo;s on the bottle</p>
<p>from a reputable brand.</p>
<p>I would also check out examine.com</p>
<p>because it mentions a range of dosages</p>
<p>that people have used</p>
<p>and in various studies to different effects.</p>
<p>Now there is something out there</p>
<p>that some of you may actually be taking or ingesting</p>
<p>that can increase cortisol</p>
<p>and not so incidentally can decrease estrogen</p>
<p>and testosterone because remember cortisol</p>
<p>is made from the cholesterol molecule.</p>
<p>So is estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>So are estrogen and testosterone, excuse me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s competitive.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re either making more cortisol</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re making more of the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, licorice,</p>
<p>which I always thought of as a candy,</p>
<p>but licorice contains a substance that I can&rsquo;t pronounce.</p>
<p>G-L-Y-C-Y-R-R-H-I-Z-I-N glycyrrhizin,</p>
<p>which is of the glabra species of plant.</p>
<p>Actually, because of its chemistry,</p>
<p>this 18 beta hydroxycyrrhidic acid,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to know all that,</p>
<p>licorice, black licorice,</p>
<p>contains a substance that increases cortisol.</p>
<p>And its increase is not huge, but it is significant.</p>
<p>This has been looked at in females age 18 to 29,</p>
<p>males and females age 18 to 29,</p>
<p>people age 30, these are separate studies</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m listing off the different ages,</p>
<p>ages 30 to 64.</p>
<p>Turns out that you can see pretty substantial increases</p>
<p>in serum cortisol and decreases in testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>So that was complete news to me.</p>
<p>Also increases in blood pressure</p>
<p>that are pretty substantial,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be downstream of cortisol.</p>
<p>Increasing cortisol has increased blood pressure</p>
<p>in order to engage the stress response.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the stress response.</p>
<p>Increased hormones of other kinds</p>
<p>that are associated with stress.</p>
<p>So who knew?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, maybe you knew previously,</p>
<p>if you did, forgive me,</p>
<p>but licorice and some of the compounds in black licorice</p>
<p>can actually increase stress,</p>
<p>probably not the thing to be ingesting</p>
<p>during periods of chronic stress.</p>
<p>Whether or not anyone has had positive effects</p>
<p>of using it to increase cortisol in other contexts,</p>
<p>let me know.</p>
<p>But very interesting that the chemistry of licorice</p>
<p>increases stress hormones.</p>
<p>And therefore you would probably want to,</p>
<p>almost certainly we want to avoid it</p>
<p>in conditions of chronic stress.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re trying to optimize testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen, licorice seems like a bad idea.</p>
<p>I suppose one instance where you might want to use licorice</p>
<p>would be if you&rsquo;re traveling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to wake up at a particular location</p>
<p>because licorice has these effects on cortisol</p>
<p>and cortisol is associated with the waking phenomenon</p>
<p>and alertness and energy, you could use it in that regard.</p>
<p>However, I would be careful to time it</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not getting two cortisol increases</p>
<p>throughout the day, two peaks.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to want to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing all the other things correct for jet lag</p>
<p>and adjusting to jet lag.</p>
<p>And if you want to know what those things are,</p>
<p>including timing your feeding, using temperature,</p>
<p>using exercise, using light to adjust to jet lag more quickly</p>
<p>please see the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work</p>
<p>where I cover all those protocols in detail.</p>
<p>The other compound that I think deserves attention</p>
<p>is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s found in chamomile.</p>
<p>Apigenin, I&rsquo;ve talked about previously,</p>
<p>it has various effects.</p>
<p>One is it is a mild anti-estrogen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been shown in various studies.</p>
<p>And it does have a bit of an anxiolytic effect</p>
<p>of reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.</p>
<p>Again, you have to decide</p>
<p>or figure out if that&rsquo;s safe for you or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you take it.</p>
<p>The major source of action is to calm the nervous system.</p>
<p>And it does that primarily by adjusting things</p>
<p>like GABA and chloride channels,</p>
<p>but also has a mild effect in reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>So ashwagandha and apigenin together</p>
<p>I would consider the most potent commercial compounds</p>
<p>that are in supplement non-prescription form</p>
<p>that one could use if they were interested</p>
<p>in reducing chronic stress, especially late in the day</p>
<p>by way of reducing cortisol late in the day.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re probably getting the impression</p>
<p>that cortisol and epinephrine</p>
<p>are a bit of a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>You want them elevated, but not for too long or too much.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them up for days and days and days,</p>
<p>but you do want to have a practice</p>
<p>in order to increase them in the short term.</p>
<p>So we should talk about protocols</p>
<p>that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine</p>
<p>that is headed towards optimal.</p>
<p>Optimization is always going to be a series</p>
<p>of regular practices that you do every day.</p>
<p>So sleeping at certain times, light at specific times,</p>
<p>food at specific times, certain foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s highly individual, but there are some universals.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve covered a number of those in the discussion today.</p>
<p>Meal timing, meal schedules has a profound effect</p>
<p>on energy levels.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the energy I&rsquo;m referring to is not glucose energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not burning carbs while running or ketones.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is neural energy,</p>
<p>epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>Fasting and timing one&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re on a kind of standard three meal a day</p>
<p>with a couple of snacks in between diet</p>
<p>or a nutrition regimen, you are fasting</p>
<p>whenever you&rsquo;re asleep or you&rsquo;re not ingesting any calories.</p>
<p>So unless you&rsquo;re hooked up to an IV of glucose,</p>
<p>you are fasting while you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>There are several different kinds of fasting</p>
<p>that can relate to epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>I will do an entire episode on optimizing food intake</p>
<p>for performance in the sports context.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I&rsquo;d like to just talk about fasting</p>
<p>as a source of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Anytime when our blood glucose is low,</p>
<p>cortisol and epinephrine are going to go up.</p>
<p>If we fast for too long, that is stress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around that.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have other beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Running a marathon is stress,</p>
<p>but it can also have positive effects if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>So stress has been demonized as a term,</p>
<p>but we want to think about stress mechanistically</p>
<p>as epinephrine and cortisol.</p>
<p>And then if we do that,</p>
<p>we can think about how to regulate its timing.</p>
<p>So anytime we haven&rsquo;t eaten for four to six hours,</p>
<p>levels of epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>are going to go up pretty substantially.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an exception to that,</p>
<p>which is if you are used to eating on the clock</p>
<p>every two hours or every hour,</p>
<p>being half hour late or being even 10 minutes late</p>
<p>on that schedule will induce stress.</p>
<p>Most of that&rsquo;s psychological stress,</p>
<p>but also the release of things like ghrelin</p>
<p>that are going to make you hungry</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on that eating clock.</p>
<p>So one thing that many people do to great benefit</p>
<p>is they follow a so-called circadian eating schedule.</p>
<p>They eat only when the sun is up,</p>
<p>they stop when the sun is down, more or less.</p>
<p>The other way to think about this</p>
<p>is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep</p>
<p>and they eat more or less upon waking,</p>
<p>assuming that they&rsquo;re waking up more or less</p>
<p>around the time that the sun rises,</p>
<p>maybe plus or minus two hours.</p>
<p>Okay, so sort of typical schedule.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say you decide to do what I do,</p>
<p>which is I skip breakfast.</p>
<p>I drink water,</p>
<p>I delay my caffeine for 90 minutes to two hours,</p>
<p>and then I drink my caffeine.</p>
<p>And then my first meal is typically around lunchtime,</p>
<p>1130 or 12.</p>
<p>And yes, occasionally I throw back some almonds</p>
<p>or walnuts or something earlier in the day.</p>
<p>I do do that from time to time if I get hungry enough</p>
<p>or if I just happen to see them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of a drive-by eater.</p>
<p>If I see blueberries or nuts or something,</p>
<p>I just kind of pick them up and put them in my mouth.</p>
<p>I try not to do that off other people&rsquo;s plates,</p>
<p>but I just have that habit of doing that from time to time.</p>
<p>But typically I don&rsquo;t eat until about noon.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a cortisol increase,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my sunlight in the morning,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m getting a big pulse in energy early in the day.</p>
<p>And yes, there&rsquo;s a little bit of agitation.</p>
<p>I am hungry sometimes early in the day, sometimes no,</p>
<p>but my ghrelin system is used to kicking in</p>
<p>right around noon.</p>
<p>At the point where I eat,</p>
<p>as long as I don&rsquo;t eat carbohydrate,</p>
<p>in my case, I know that my epinephrine levels</p>
<p>are going to stay pretty high.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s usually meat and salad</p>
<p>or something of that sort or fish and salad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like eating fish because of the taste,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m essentially low carb or keto-ish throughout the day.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m probably in a slightly elevated state</p>
<p>of epinephrine and cortisol throughout the day.</p>
<p>Some of you are fasting even longer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pushing out till 4 p.m. or 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re even fasting around the clock.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re fasting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing epinephrine and cortisol release.</p>
<p>You can do all the meditation in the world</p>
<p>to keep your mind calm,</p>
<p>but you are closer to that edge of stress</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re closer to that edge of peak stress.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s just important to understand.</p>
<p>The description about comfort foods and cortisol</p>
<p>was one of kind of an extreme case</p>
<p>where cortisol systems kick over to a positive feedback loop</p>
<p>but we all eat to suppress cortisol and epinephrine.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>cortisol and epinephrine create an agitation</p>
<p>so we go seek food.</p>
<p>When we ingest food,</p>
<p>typically if it includes carbohydrate,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a blunting of cortisol,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a blunting of epinephrine in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had too much coffee to drink</p>
<p>and you go and have a couple of pieces of bread,</p>
<p>you will feel the,</p>
<p>we might describe it as the caffeine</p>
<p>getting soaked up out of your system,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re elevating blood glucose,</p>
<p>which is more or less saturating</p>
<p>the effect of caffeine in your system.</p>
<p>Not completely, but it&rsquo;s going to have that effect.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re very stressed and you sit down to eat something,</p>
<p>it will calm you down.</p>
<p>Yes, because some of the blood that goes to your stomach,</p>
<p>but more so because of these effects</p>
<p>in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.</p>
<p>So the important point here is that</p>
<p>if you want to be alert,</p>
<p>you can do that by way of not eating.</p>
<p>Of course, please ingest fluids.</p>
<p>I know some people water fast out there.</p>
<p>I am yet to see good science on water fasting</p>
<p>and why that can stimulate stem cells.</p>
<p>Or people love the idea</p>
<p>after the Nobel prize was given for autophagy</p>
<p>and this idea that our cells clean up debris</p>
<p>and senescent cells.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But the idea that water fasting is going to promote that,</p>
<p>I find rather amusing.</p>
<p>Please send me the data</p>
<p>if you know of some great study in a decent journal,</p>
<p>but pretty much this is something I hear about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think water fasting is a good idea,</p>
<p>nor should you be drinking so much water</p>
<p>that you kill yourself.</p>
<p>You can actually drink enough water that you die.</p>
<p>So I think ingesting water in healthy amounts</p>
<p>is a good thing, stay hydrated.</p>
<p>But if you want to be alert, stay hydrated.</p>
<p>Caffeine may or may not be in your regimen,</p>
<p>but fasting will make sure</p>
<p>that your levels of energy are up</p>
<p>and you will be primed very well for doing a protocol</p>
<p>of the sort that we talked about earlier in this episode</p>
<p>of breathing or cold exposure or exercise</p>
<p>to get that increase in the immune system function.</p>
<p>And if you do that after learning,</p>
<p>after trying to learn something,</p>
<p>it will increase learning</p>
<p>for that particular set of information,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s motor or language</p>
<p>or whatever it happens to be, mathematics, programming.</p>
<p>So fasting is a tool for many reasons.</p>
<p>It can increase growth hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>But today I&rsquo;m talking about fasting as a tool</p>
<p>to bias your system toward more epinephrine</p>
<p>and adrenaline release and toward more cortisol release,</p>
<p>but still low enough that it&rsquo;s not chronic stress,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not causing negative health effects.</p>
<p>But please know that if life is very, very stressful,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re experiencing lots of stressors</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re chronically fasting,</p>
<p>you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood</p>
<p>of being chronically stressed in the ways that are negative,</p>
<p>negative effects on the reproductive axis,</p>
<p>lower testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>negative effects on your hair will turn gray.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reasons for that.</p>
<p>Your sleep will suffer, your immune system will suffer.</p>
<p>So I think while it&rsquo;s nuanced,</p>
<p>our discussion today about epinephrine and cortisol,</p>
<p>increasing energy and immunity are designed</p>
<p>to help you understand</p>
<p>when you should be doing certain things,</p>
<p>when you should throttle back,</p>
<p>when you might want to kick up your adrenaline a bit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re suffering from low energy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just kind of feeling down</p>
<p>and a little bit under activated,</p>
<p>well then the practices of ice baths</p>
<p>and intense breathing, et cetera, could be very beneficial.</p>
<p>So might fasting.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re feeling exhausted and burnt out,</p>
<p>so drained and stressed,</p>
<p>well then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure</p>
<p>or doing a lot of intense exercise</p>
<p>is driving you further and further into chronic stress.</p>
<p>So because I don&rsquo;t have a saliva test or a blood test</p>
<p>or God forbid an earwax test to measure your cortisol</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re engaging in this discussion together,</p>
<p>you have to gauge for yourself</p>
<p>whether or not you are in a state of under activated</p>
<p>and need more epinephrine and cortisol,</p>
<p>or whether or not you are over activated</p>
<p>in terms of cortisol and epinephrine</p>
<p>and you need ways to buffer those, ashwagandha.</p>
<p>Maybe it should be a warm mellow bath, not an ice bath.</p>
<p>So one has to learn how to regulate these hormones</p>
<p>with behavior, with nutrition, perhaps with supplementation.</p>
<p>And then of course there are prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And I always leave these to the end</p>
<p>because A, I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not prescribing anything, I&rsquo;m a professor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m professing a number of things that you can decide</p>
<p>for yourselves what to do with or not.</p>
<p>But of course there are prescription drugs</p>
<p>that can increase cortisol or decrease cortisol</p>
<p>in cases like Cushing syndrome,</p>
<p>which if you have that diagnosed,</p>
<p>you should talk to a physician.</p>
<p>You should talk ideally to a endocrinologist,</p>
<p>but to a physician of some sort, board certified physician.</p>
<p>There are drugs that can be used to treat injury</p>
<p>like corticosterones that you can inject</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation and injury, but they are cortisol.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to bias you</p>
<p>towards more stress in other domains.</p>
<p>Remember, cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to be more prone to psychological stress.</p>
<p>I also want to mention again</p>
<p>that I think there&rsquo;s great benefit to having a practice</p>
<p>that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe every third day or every other day</p>
<p>of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body</p>
<p>while learning to stay calm in the mind</p>
<p>so that you learn to separate the brain-body experience.</p>
<p>You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is</p>
<p>to unify the brain and body,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all out of touch with our brain and bodies.</p>
<p>I particularly dislike claims like that</p>
<p>or statements like that because there&rsquo;s great power,</p>
<p>as we learned today, in having your body activated</p>
<p>by some sort of stimulus, cold water,</p>
<p>or even psychological stress,</p>
<p>but learning to stay calm in your mind.</p>
<p>I should just remind you that most of the negative effects</p>
<p>on your life and on the lives of others are due to people,</p>
<p>perhaps you, I hope not,</p>
<p>being unable to regulate their mind</p>
<p>when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body,</p>
<p>either because they read something in a text</p>
<p>or a comment section.</p>
<p>Of course, that never happens to me,</p>
<p>but it may happen to you.</p>
<p>Of course, it happens to me,</p>
<p>but the idea is to stay calm in your mind</p>
<p>so that then you can regulate your action, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that there are these practices</p>
<p>that one can develop over time</p>
<p>that are really straightforward and zero cost, right?</p>
<p>You could find any number of ways</p>
<p>to increase your adrenaline and stay calm,</p>
<p>and we tend to focus on things like exercise</p>
<p>as the way that we get our energy up,</p>
<p>but today, again, I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about deliberately increasing adrenaline</p>
<p>while staying calm mentally</p>
<p>because that has great utility</p>
<p>when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events,</p>
<p>through things that we didn&rsquo;t seek out.</p>
<p>So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol</p>
<p>is about inducing them deliberately</p>
<p>when you want to push back on infection,</p>
<p>potential infection from bacteria or viruses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about pulling back on adrenaline and cortisol,</p>
<p>maybe through the use of supplementation,</p>
<p>but certainly through proper use of light and sleep</p>
<p>and mental tools that we talked about as well</p>
<p>when they are chronically elevated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about training your system</p>
<p>not just to be unified at brain and body,</p>
<p>which sounds great until you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about having a deliberate dissociation</p>
<p>between the adrenaline response from the adrenals</p>
<p>and the adrenaline response from the brainstem.</p>
<p>So once again, we&rsquo;ve covered a ton of material.</p>
<p>I hope right now you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>okay, am I in a state of chronic stress?</p>
<p>Am I under activated?</p>
<p>Or could I afford to increase my levels</p>
<p>of adrenaline and cortisol to improve my relationship</p>
<p>to my immune system and to energy, neural energy?</p>
<p>If you like the information</p>
<p>that you heard today and you want to remember it,</p>
<p>well then, at the end of this episode,</p>
<p>perhaps you go do something</p>
<p>to increase your level of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And now you know what some of those things are</p>
<p>because it will help you retain the information.</p>
<p>Or you could apply that to anything else</p>
<p>that you learn or experience, of course.</p>
<p>And I hope that you&rsquo;ll think about some of the ways</p>
<p>in which cortisol and adrenaline are not good or bad,</p>
<p>that stress isn&rsquo;t good or bad,</p>
<p>but short-term stress is healthy.</p>
<p>Alertness and energy is healthy,</p>
<p>even if it puts you at the edge of agitation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an opportunity to learn</p>
<p>how to control these hormones better.</p>
<p>And I hope that if you&rsquo;re in a state of chronic stress,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll do things to start tamping down</p>
<p>some of that stress and that you realize</p>
<p>that your nervous system and your hormone system are linked,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re linked in ways that you can control,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to be slaves to our hormones</p>
<p>and certainly not the hormones that cause us stress.</p>
<p>We can learn to control those,</p>
<p>both to the benefit of our body and benefit of mind.</p>
