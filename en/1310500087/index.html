    <p>The following is a conversation with Richard Dawkins,</p>
<p>an evolutionary biologist and author of The Selfish Gene,</p>
<p>The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, The Magic of Reality,</p>
<p>and The Greatest Show of Earth and his latest All Growing God.</p>
<p>He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology</p>
<p>and science in general, including, funny enough, the introduction of the word</p>
<p>meme in his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, which, in the context of a gene centered view of evolution,</p>
<p>is an exceptionally powerful idea. He&rsquo;s outspoken, bold, and often fearless in the</p>
<p>defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending love your way. Stay strong. We&rsquo;re in this together. We&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer,</p>
<p>security in all digital transactions is very important. Let me mention the PCI</p>
<p>data security standard that Cash App is compliant with. I&rsquo;m a big fan of standards for safety and</p>
<p>security. PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed</p>
<p>that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.</p>
<p>Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems in</p>
<p>general. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX</p>
<p>PODCAST, you get ten dollars and Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people</p>
<p>around the world. And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Richard Dawkins.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there in the universe?</p>
<p>Well, if we accept that there&rsquo;s intelligent life here and we accept that the number of planets in</p>
<p>the universe is gigantic, I mean, 10 to the 22 stars has been estimated, it seems to me highly</p>
<p>likely that there is not only life in the universe elsewhere, but also intelligent life. If you deny</p>
<p>that, then you&rsquo;re committed to the view that the things that happened on this planet are</p>
<p>staggeringly improbable, I mean, ludicrously off the charts improbable. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>improbable. Certainly the origin of life itself, there are really two steps, the origin of life,</p>
<p>which is probably fairly improbable, and then the subsequent evolution to intelligent life,</p>
<p>which is also fairly improbable. So the juxtaposition of those two, you could say,</p>
<p>is pretty improbable, but not 10 to the 22 improbable. It&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re coming on to it, how we would recognize intelligence from outer space if we</p>
<p>encountered it. The most likely way we would come across them would be by radio. It&rsquo;s highly</p>
<p>unlikely they&rsquo;d ever visit us. But it&rsquo;s not that unlikely that we would pick up radio signals,</p>
<p>and then we would have to have some means of deciding that it was intelligent.</p>
<p>People involved in the SETI program discuss how they would do it, and things like prime numbers</p>
<p>would be an obvious way for them to broadcast, to say, we are intelligent, we are here.</p>
<p>I suspect it probably would be obvious, actually.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting, prime numbers, so the mathematical patterns, it&rsquo;s an open question</p>
<p>whether mathematics is the same for us as it would be for aliens. I suppose we could assume</p>
<p>that ultimately, if we&rsquo;re governed by the same laws of physics, then we should be governed by</p>
<p>the same laws of mathematics.</p>
<p>I think so. I suspect that they will have Pythagoras theorem, etc. I don&rsquo;t think their</p>
<p>mathematics will be that different.</p>
<p>Do you think evolution would also be a force on the alien planets as well?</p>
<p>I stuck my neck out and said that if ever that we do discover life elsewhere, it will be Darwinian</p>
<p>life, in the sense that it will work by some kind of natural selection, the nonrandom survival of</p>
<p>randomly generated codes. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the genetic, it would have to have some kind of</p>
<p>genetics, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be DNA genetics, probably wouldn&rsquo;t be actually.</p>
<p>But I think it would have to be Darwinian, yes.</p>
<p>So some kind of selection process.</p>
<p>Yes, in the general sense, it would be Darwinian.</p>
<p>So let me ask kind of an artificial intelligence engineering question. So you&rsquo;ve been an</p>
<p>outspoken critic of, I guess, what could be called intelligent design, which is an attempt</p>
<p>to describe the creation of a human mind and body by some religious folks, religious folks</p>
<p>used to describe. So broadly speaking, evolution is, as far as I know, again, you can correct me,</p>
<p>is the only scientific theory we have for the development of intelligent life. Like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>alternative theory, as far as I understand.</p>
<p>None has ever been suggested, and I suspect it never will be.</p>
<p>Well, of course, whenever somebody says that, a hundred years later.</p>
<p>I know. It&rsquo;s a risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risk. But what a bet. I mean, I&rsquo;m pretty confident.</p>
<p>But it would look, sorry, yes, it would probably look very similar, but it&rsquo;s almost like Einstein</p>
<p>general relativity versus Newtonian physics. It&rsquo;ll be maybe an alteration of the theory or</p>
<p>something like that, but it won&rsquo;t be fundamentally different. But okay.</p>
<p>So now for the past 70 years, even before the AI community has been trying to engineer</p>
<p>intelligence, in a sense, to do what intelligent design says, you know, was done here on earth.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition? Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to build intelligence, to build computers that</p>
<p>are intelligent, or do we need to do something like the evolutionary process? Like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no shortcuts here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question. I&rsquo;m committed to the belief that is ultimately possible</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s nothing nonphysical in our brains. I think our brains work by</p>
<p>the laws of physics. And so it must, in principle, it&rsquo;d be possible to replicate that.</p>
<p>In practice, though, it might be very difficult. And as you suggest, it may be the only way</p>
<p>to do it is by something like an evolutionary process. I&rsquo;d be surprised. I suspect that</p>
<p>it will come, but it&rsquo;s certainly been slower in coming than some of the early pioneers</p>
<p>thought it would be.</p>
<p>Yeah. But in your sense, is the evolutionary process efficient? So you can see it as exceptionally</p>
<p>wasteful in one perspective, but at the same time, maybe that is the only path.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a paradox, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, on the one side, it is deplorably wasteful. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fundamentally based on waste. On the other hand, it does produce magnificent results.</p>
<p>I mean, the design of a soaring bird, an albatross, a vulture, an eagle, is superb. An engineer</p>
<p>would be proud to have done it. On the other hand, an engineer would not be proud to have</p>
<p>done some of the other things that evolution has served up. Some of the sort of botched</p>
<p>jobs that you can easily understand because of their historical origins, but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look well designed.</p>
<p>Do you have examples of bad design?</p>
<p>My favorite example is the recurrent laryngeal nerve. I&rsquo;ve used this many times. This is</p>
<p>a nerve. It&rsquo;s one of the cranial nerves, which goes from the brain, and the end organ is</p>
<p>that it supplies is the voice box, the larynx. But it doesn&rsquo;t go straight to the larynx.</p>
<p>It goes right down into the chest and then loops around an artery in the chest and then</p>
<p>comes straight back up again to the larynx. And I&rsquo;ve assisted in the dissection of a</p>
<p>giraffe&rsquo;s neck, which happened to have died in a zoo. And we saw the recurrent laryngeal</p>
<p>nerve whizzing straight past the larynx, within an inch of the larynx, down into the chest,</p>
<p>and then back up again, which is a detour of many feet. Very, very inefficient.</p>
<p>The reason is historical. The ancestors are fish ancestors, the ancestors of all mammals</p>
<p>and fish. The most direct pathway of that, of the equivalent of that nerve, there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a larynx in those days, but it innervated part of the gills. The most direct pathway</p>
<p>was behind that artery. And then when the mammal, when the tetrapods, when the land</p>
<p>vertebrae started evolving, and then the neck started to stretch, the marginal cost of changing</p>
<p>the embryological design to jump that nerve over the artery was too great. Or rather,</p>
<p>each step of the way was a very small cost, but the cost of actually jumping it over would have</p>
<p>been very large. As the neck lengthened, it was a negligible change to just increase the length of</p>
<p>the detour a tiny bit, a tiny bit, a tiny bit, each millimeter at a time, didn&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>
<p>But finally, when you get to a giraffe, it&rsquo;s a huge detour and no doubt is very inefficient.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s bad design. Any engineer would reject that piece of design. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And there are quite a number of examples, as you&rsquo;d expect. It&rsquo;s not surprising that we find</p>
<p>examples of that sort. In a way, what&rsquo;s surprising is there aren&rsquo;t more of them. In a way, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>surprising is that the design of living things is so good. So natural selection manages to achieve</p>
<p>excellent results, partly by tinkering, partly by coming along and cleaning up initial mistakes and,</p>
<p>as it were, making the best of a bad job. That&rsquo;s really interesting. I mean, it is surprising and</p>
<p>beautiful and it&rsquo;s a mystery from an engineering perspective that so many things are well designed.</p>
<p>I suppose the thing we&rsquo;re forgetting is how many generations have to die for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the inefficiency of it. Yes, that&rsquo;s the horrible wastefulness of it.</p>
<p>So yeah, we marvel at the final product, but yeah, the process is painful.</p>
<p>Elon Musk describes human beings as potentially what he calls the biological bootloader for</p>
<p>artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence is used as the term. It&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like super intelligence. Do you see superhuman level intelligence as potentially the next step</p>
<p>in the evolutionary process? Yes, I think that if superhuman intelligence is to be found,</p>
<p>it will be artificial. I don&rsquo;t have any hope that we ourselves, our brains will go on</p>
<p>getting larger in ordinary biological evolution. I think that&rsquo;s probably come to an end. It is</p>
<p>the dominant trend or one of the dominant trends in our fossil history for the last two or three</p>
<p>million years. Brain size? Brain size, yes. So it&rsquo;s been swelling rather dramatically over the last</p>
<p>two or three million years. That is unlikely to continue. The only way that happens is because</p>
<p>natural selection favors those individuals with the biggest brains and that&rsquo;s not happening anymore.</p>
<p>Right. So in general, in humans, the selection pressures are not, I mean, are they active in</p>
<p>any form? Well, in order for them to be active, it would be necessary that the most, let&rsquo;s call it</p>
<p>intelligence. Not that intelligence is simply correlated with brain size, but let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>intelligence. In order for that to evolve, it&rsquo;s necessary that the most intelligent beings have</p>
<p>the most, individuals have the most children. And so intelligence may buy you money, it may buy you</p>
<p>worldly success, it may buy you a nice house and a nice car and things like that if you have a</p>
<p>successful career. It may buy you the admiration of your fellow people, but it doesn&rsquo;t increase the</p>
<p>number of offspring that you have. It doesn&rsquo;t increase your genetic legacy to the next generation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, artificial intelligence, I mean, computers and technology generally, is</p>
<p>is evolving by a non genetic means, by leaps and bounds, of course. And so what do you think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar, there&rsquo;s a company called Neuralink, but there&rsquo;s a general effort of</p>
<p>brain computer interfaces, which is to try to build a connection between the computer and the brain</p>
<p>to send signals both directions. And the long term dream there is to do exactly that, which is expand,</p>
<p>I guess, expand the size of the brain, expand the capabilities of the brain. Do you see this as</p>
<p>interesting? Do you see this as a promising possible technology? Or is the interface between</p>
<p>the computer and the brain, like the brain is this wet, messy thing that&rsquo;s just impossible to</p>
<p>interface with? Well, of course, it&rsquo;s interesting, whether it&rsquo;s promising, I&rsquo;m really not qualified</p>
<p>to say. What I do find puzzling is that the brain being as small as it is compared to a computer and</p>
<p>the individual components being as slow as they are compared to our electronic components,</p>
<p>it is astonishing what it can do. I mean, imagine building a computer that fits into the size of a</p>
<p>human skull. And with the equivalent of transistors or integrated circuits, which work as slowly as</p>
<p>neurons do. It&rsquo;s something mysterious about that, something, something must be going on that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand. So I have just talked to Roger Penrose, I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re familiar with his</p>
<p>work. And he also describes this kind of mystery in the mind, in the brain, that as he sees a</p>
<p>materialist, so there&rsquo;s no sort of mystical thing going on. But there&rsquo;s so much about the material</p>
<p>of the brain that we don&rsquo;t understand. That might be quantum mechanical in nature and so on. So</p>
<p>there the idea is about consciousness. Do you have any, have you ever thought about, do you ever</p>
<p>think about ideas of consciousness or a little bit more about the mystery of intelligence and</p>
<p>consciousness that seems to pop up just like you&rsquo;re saying from our brain? I agree with Roger</p>
<p>Penrose that there is a mystery there. I mean, he&rsquo;s one of the world&rsquo;s greatest physicists. I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t possibly argue with his&hellip; But nobody knows anything about consciousness. And in fact,</p>
<p>if we talk about religion and so on, the mystery of consciousness is so awe inspiring and we know</p>
<p>so little about it that the leap to sort of religious or mystical explanations is too easy</p>
<p>to make. I think that it&rsquo;s just an act of cowardice to leap to religious explanations and</p>
<p>Roger doesn&rsquo;t do that, of course. But I accept that there may be something that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about it. So correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but in your book, Selfish Gene, the gene centered view of</p>
<p>evolution allows us to think of the physical organisms as just the medium through which the</p>
<p>software of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate. So maybe can we start just with the</p>
<p>basics? What in this context does the word meme mean? It would mean the cultural equivalent of a</p>
<p>gene, cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene in the</p>
<p>transmission of culture and the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense. And it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>useful word if there&rsquo;s something Darwinian going on. Obviously, culture is transmitted,</p>
<p>but is there anything Darwinian going on? And if there is, that means there has to be something</p>
<p>like a gene, which becomes more numerous or less numerous in the population.</p>
<p>So it can replicate?</p>
<p>It can replicate. Well, it clearly does replicate. There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>The question is, does it replicate in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion? Could you</p>
<p>say that certain ideas propagate because they&rsquo;re successful in the meme pool? In a sort of trivial</p>
<p>sense, you can. Would you wish to say, though, that in the same way as an animal body is modified,</p>
<p>adapted to serve as a machine for propagating genes, is it also a machine for propagating memes?</p>
<p>Could you actually say that something about the way a human is, is modified, adapted,</p>
<p>is modified, adapted for the function of meme propagation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a fascinating possibility, if that&rsquo;s true. That it&rsquo;s not just about the genes which</p>
<p>seem somehow more comprehensible as these things of biology. The idea that culture or maybe ideas,</p>
<p>you can really broadly define it, operates under these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Even morphology, even anatomy does evolve by memetic means. I mean, things like hairstyles,</p>
<p>styles of makeup, circumcision, these things are actual changes in the body form which are</p>
<p>nongenetic and which get passed on from generation to generation or sideways like a virus in a</p>
<p>quasi genetic way.</p>
<p>But the moment you start drifting away from the physical, it becomes interesting because</p>
<p>the space of ideas, ideologies, political systems.</p>
<p>Of course, yes.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your sense? Are memes a metaphor more or are they really,</p>
<p>is there something fundamental, almost physical presence of memes?</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re a bit more than a metaphor. And I mentioned the physical</p>
<p>bodily characteristics which are a bit trivial in a way, but when things like the propagation</p>
<p>of religious ideas, both longitudinally down generations and transversely as in a sort of</p>
<p>epidemiology of ideas, when a charismatic preacher converts people, that resembles viral</p>
<p>transmission. Whereas the longitudinal transmission from grandparent to parent to child,</p>
<p>et cetera, is more like conventional genetic transmission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful, especially in the modern day idea. Do you think about this</p>
<p>implication in social networks where the propagation of ideas, the viral propagation of ideas,</p>
<p>and has the new use of the word meme to describe?</p>
<p>Well, the internet, of course, provides extremely rapid method of transmission.</p>
<p>Before, when I first coined the word, the internet didn&rsquo;t exist. And so I was thinking</p>
<p>that in terms of books, newspapers, broader radio, television, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now an idea can just leap around the world in all directions instantly. And so the internet</p>
<p>provides a step change in the facility of propagation of memes.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel? Isn&rsquo;t it fascinating that sort of ideas, it&rsquo;s like you have Galapagos</p>
<p>Islands or something, it&rsquo;s the 70s, and the internet allowed all these species to just</p>
<p>like globalize. And in a matter of seconds, you can spread the message to millions of</p>
<p>people. And these ideas, these memes can breed, can evolve, can mutate. And there&rsquo;s a selection,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like different, I guess, groups that have all like, there&rsquo;s a dynamics that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating here. Do you think, yes, basically, do you think your work in this direction,</p>
<p>while fundamentally was focused on life on Earth, do you think it should continue, like</p>
<p>to be taken further?</p>
<p>Well, I do think it would probably be a good idea to think in a Darwinian way about this</p>
<p>sort of thing. We conventionally think of the transmission of ideas from an evolutionary</p>
<p>context as being limited to, in our ancestors, people living in villages, living in small</p>
<p>bands where everybody knew each other, and ideas could propagate within the village,</p>
<p>and they might hop to a neighboring village, occasionally, and maybe even to a neighboring</p>
<p>continent eventually. And that was a slow process. Nowadays, villages are international.</p>
<p>I mean, you have people, it&rsquo;s been called echo chambers, where people are in a sort</p>
<p>of internet village, where the other members of the village may be geographically distributed</p>
<p>all over the world, but they just happen to be interested in the same things, use the</p>
<p>same terminology, the same jargon, have the same enthusiasm. So, people like the Flat</p>
<p>Earth Society, they don&rsquo;t all live in one place, they find each other, and they talk</p>
<p>the same language to each other, they talk the same nonsense to each other. And they,</p>
<p>so this is a kind of distributed version of the primitive idea of people living in villages</p>
<p>and propagating their ideas in a local way.</p>
<p>Is there Darwinist parallel here? So, is there evolutionary purpose of villages, or is that</p>
<p>just a&hellip;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use a word like evolutionary purpose in that case, but villages will be something</p>
<p>that just emerged, that&rsquo;s the way people happen to live.</p>
<p>And in just the same kind of way, the Flat Earth Society, societies of ideas emerge in</p>
<p>the same kind of way in this digital space.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say about the, I guess, from a perspective of Darwin,</p>
<p>could we fully interpret the dynamics of social interaction in these social networks? Or is</p>
<p>there some much more complicated thing need to be developed? Like, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Well, a Darwinian selection idea would involve investigating which ideas spread and which</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t. So, some ideas don&rsquo;t have the ability to spread. I mean, the Flat Earth, Flat Earthism</p>
<p>is, there are a few people believe in it, but it&rsquo;s not going to spread because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obvious nonsense. But other ideas, even if they are wrong, can spread because they are</p>
<p>attractive in some sense.</p>
<p>So the spreading and the selection in the Darwinian context is, it just has to be attractive</p>
<p>in some sense. Like we don&rsquo;t have to define, like it doesn&rsquo;t have to be attractive in the</p>
<p>way that animals attract each other. It could be attractive in some other way.</p>
<p>Yes. All that matters is, all that is needed is that it should spread. And it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be true to spread. In truth, there&rsquo;s one criterion which might help an idea to spread.</p>
<p>But there are other criteria which might help it to spread. As you say, attraction in animals</p>
<p>is not necessarily valuable for survival. The famous peacock&rsquo;s tail doesn&rsquo;t help the</p>
<p>peacock to survive. It helps it to pass on its genes. Similarly, an idea which is actually</p>
<p>rubbish, but which people don&rsquo;t know is rubbish and think is very attractive will spread in</p>
<p>the same way as a peacock&rsquo;s gene spread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small sidestep. I remember reading somewhere, I think recently, that in some</p>
<p>species of birds, sort of the idea that beauty may have its own purpose and the idea that</p>
<p>some birds, I&rsquo;m being ineloquent here, but there&rsquo;s some aspects of their feathers and</p>
<p>so on that serve no evolutionary purpose whatsoever. There&rsquo;s somebody making an argument that there</p>
<p>are some things about beauty that animals do that may be its own purpose. Does that</p>
<p>ring a bell for you? Does that sound ridiculous?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a rather distorted bell. Darwin, when he coined the phrase sexual selection,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t feel the need to suggest that what was attractive to females, usually is males</p>
<p>attracting females, that what females found attractive had to be useful. He said it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be useful. It was enough that females found it attractive. And so it could be completely</p>
<p>useless, probably was completely useless in the conventional sense, but was not at all</p>
<p>useless in the sense of passing on, Darwin didn&rsquo;t call them genes, but in the sense of</p>
<p>reproducing. Others, starting with Wallace, the co discoverer of natural selection, didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that idea and they wanted sexually selected characteristics like peacock&rsquo;s tails to be</p>
<p>in some sense useful. It&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock&rsquo;s tail as being useful,</p>
<p>but in the sense of survival, but others have run with that idea and have brought it up</p>
<p>to date. And so there are two schools of thought on sexual selection, which are still active</p>
<p>and about equally supported now. Those who follow Darwin in thinking that it&rsquo;s just enough</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s attractive and those who follow Wallace and say that it has to be in some</p>
<p>sense useful.</p>
<p>Do you fall into one category or the other?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m open minded. I think they both could be correct in different cases. I mean, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>both been made sophisticated in a mathematical sense, more so than when Darwin and Wallace</p>
<p>first started talking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, I romanticize things, so I prefer the former, where the beauty in itself is</p>
<p>a powerful attraction, is a powerful force in evolution. On religion, do you think there</p>
<p>will ever be a time in our future where almost nobody believes in God, or God is not a part</p>
<p>of the moral fabric of our society?</p>
<p>Yes, I do. I think it may happen after a very long time. It may take a long time for that</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>So do you think ultimately for everybody on Earth, religion, other forms of doctrines,</p>
<p>ideas could do better job than what religion does?</p>
<p>Yes. I mean, following in truth, reason.</p>
<p>Well, truth is a funny, funny word. And reason too. There&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s a difficult idea</p>
<p>now with truth on the internet, right, and fake news and so on. I suppose when you say</p>
<p>reason, you mean the very basic sort of inarguable conclusions of science versus which political</p>
<p>system is better.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. I mean, truth about the real world, which is ascertainable by, not just by the</p>
<p>more rigorous methods of science, but by just ordinary sensory observation.</p>
<p>So do you think there will ever be a time when we move past it? Like, I guess another</p>
<p>way to ask it, are we hopelessly, fundamentally tied to religion in the way our society functions?</p>
<p>Well, clearly all individuals are not hopelessly tied to it because many individuals don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe. You could mean something like society needs religion in order to function properly,</p>
<p>something like that. And some people have suggested that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition on that?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve read books on it and they&rsquo;re persuasive. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re that persuasive though.</p>
<p>I mean, some people suggested that society needs a sort of figurehead, which can be a</p>
<p>non existent figurehead in order to function properly. I think there&rsquo;s something rather</p>
<p>patronising about the idea that, well, you and I are intelligent enough not to believe</p>
<p>in God, but the plebs need it sort of thing. And I think that&rsquo;s patronising. And I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to think that that was not the right way to proceed.</p>
<p>But at the individual level, do you think there&rsquo;s some value of spirituality? Sort of,</p>
<p>if I think sort of as a scientist, the amount of things we actually know about our universe</p>
<p>is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of what we could possibly know. So just from everything,</p>
<p>even the certainty we have about the laws of physics, it seems to be that there&rsquo;s yet</p>
<p>a huge amount to discover. And therefore we&rsquo;re sitting where 99.99% of things are just still</p>
<p>shrouded in mystery. Do you think there&rsquo;s a role in a kind of spiritual view of that,</p>
<p>sort of a humbled spiritual view?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s right to be humble. I think it&rsquo;s right to admit that there&rsquo;s a lot we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, a lot we don&rsquo;t understand, a lot that we still need to work on. We&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>it. What I don&rsquo;t think is that it helps to invoke supernatural explanations. If our current</p>
<p>scientific explanations aren&rsquo;t adequate to do the job, then we need better ones. We need</p>
<p>to work more. And of course, the history of science shows just that, that as science goes</p>
<p>on, problems get solved one after another, and the science advances as science gets better.</p>
<p>But to invoke a non scientific, non physical explanation is simply to lie down in a cowardly</p>
<p>way and say, we can&rsquo;t solve it, so we&rsquo;re going to invoke magic. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s do that. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say we need better science. We need more science. It may be that the science will never do it.</p>
<p>It may be that we will never actually understand everything. And that&rsquo;s okay, but let&rsquo;s keep</p>
<p>working on it.</p>
<p>A challenging question there is, do you think science can lead us astray in terms of the</p>
<p>humbleness? So there&rsquo;s some aspect of science, maybe it&rsquo;s the aspect of scientists and not</p>
<p>science, but of sort of a mix of ego and confidence that can lead us astray in terms of discovering</p>
<p>the, you know, some of the big open questions about the universe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right. I mean, there are, there are arrogant people in any walk of life and</p>
<p>scientists are no exception to that. And so there are arrogant scientists who think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>solved everything. Of course we haven&rsquo;t. So humility is a proper stance for a scientist.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a proper working stance because it encourages further work. But in a way to</p>
<p>resort to a supernatural explanation is a kind of arrogance because it&rsquo;s saying, well,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand it scientifically. Therefore the non scientific religious supernatural</p>
<p>explanation must be the right one. That&rsquo;s arrogant. What is, what is humble is to say</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know and we need to work further on it.</p>
<p>So maybe if I could psychoanalyze you for a second, you have at times been just slightly</p>
<p>frustrated with people who have supernat, you know, have a supernatural. Has that changed</p>
<p>over the years? Have you become like, how do people that kind of have a seek supernatural</p>
<p>explanations, how do you see those people as human beings as it&rsquo;s like, do you see them</p>
<p>as dishonest? Do you see them as, um, sort of, uh, ignorant? Do you see them as, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, is it like, how do you think of certainly not, not, not dishonest. And, and I mean,</p>
<p>obviously many of them are perfectly nice people. So I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t sort of despise</p>
<p>them in that sense. Um, I think it&rsquo;s often a misunderstanding that, that, um, people</p>
<p>will jump from the admission that we don&rsquo;t understand something. They will jump straight</p>
<p>to what they think of as an alternative explanation, which is the supernatural one, which is not</p>
<p>an alternative. It&rsquo;s a non explanation. Um, instead of jumping to the conclusion that</p>
<p>science needs more work, that we need to actually get, do some better, better science. So, um,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, I mean, personal antipathy towards such people. I just think they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>misguided.</p>
<p>So what about this really interesting space that I have trouble with? So religion I have</p>
<p>a better grasp on, but, um, there&rsquo;s a large communities, like you said, Flat Earth community,</p>
<p>uh, that I&rsquo;ve recently, because I&rsquo;ve made a few jokes about it. I saw that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there&rsquo;s people that take it quite seriously. So there&rsquo;s this bigger</p>
<p>world of conspiracy theorists, which is a kind of, I mean, there&rsquo;s elements of it that</p>
<p>are religious as well, but I think they&rsquo;re also scientific. So the, the basic credo of</p>
<p>a conspiracy theorist is to question everything, which is also the credo of a good scientist,</p>
<p>I would say. So what do you make of this?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s probably too easy to say that by labeling something conspiracy,</p>
<p>you therefore dismiss it. I mean, occasionally conspiracies are right. And so we shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand. We should examine them on their own merits. Flat</p>
<p>Earthism is obvious nonsense. We don&rsquo;t have to examine that much further. Um, but, um,</p>
<p>I mean, there may be other conspiracy theories which are actually right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, you know, grew up in the Soviet Union. So I, I just, you know, uh, the space race</p>
<p>was very influential for me on both sides of the coin. Uh, you know, there&rsquo;s a conspiracy</p>
<p>theory that we never went to the moon. Right. And it&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s like, I cannot understand</p>
<p>it and it&rsquo;s very difficult to rigorously scientifically show one way or the other. It&rsquo;s just, you</p>
<p>have to use some of the human intuition about who would have to lie, who would have to work</p>
<p>together. And it&rsquo;s clear that very unlikely, uh, good behind that is my general intuition</p>
<p>that most people in this world are good. You know, in order to really put together some</p>
<p>conspiracy theories, there has to be a large number of people working together and essentially</p>
<p>being dishonest.</p>
<p>Yes, which is improbable. The sheer number who would have to be in on this conspiracy</p>
<p>and the sheer detail, the attention to detail they&rsquo;d have had to have had and so on. I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>also worry about the motive and why would anyone want to suggest that it didn&rsquo;t happen?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the, why is it so hard to believe? I mean, the, the physics of it,</p>
<p>the mathematics of it, the, the idea of computing orbits and, and, and trajectories and things,</p>
<p>it, it all works mathematically. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you believe it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a psychology question because there&rsquo;s something really pleasant about, um, you know,</p>
<p>pointing out that the emperor has no clothes when everybody like, uh, you know, thinking</p>
<p>outside the box and coming up with the true answer where everybody else is diluted. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something, I mean, I have that for science, right? You want to prove the entire scientific</p>
<p>community wrong. That&rsquo;s the whole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s right. And, and of course, historically, lone geniuses have come</p>
<p>out right sometimes, but often people with who think they&rsquo;re a lone genius much more</p>
<p>often turn out not to. Um, so you have to judge each case on its merits. The mere fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a maverick, the mere fact that you, you&rsquo;re going against the current tide</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you right. You&rsquo;ve got to show you&rsquo;re right by looking at the evidence.</p>
<p>So because you focus so much on, on religion and disassembled a lot of ideas there and</p>
<p>I just, I was wondering if, if you have ideas about conspiracy theory groups, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a prevalent, even reaching into, uh, presidential politics and so on. It seems</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a very large communities that believe different kinds of conspiracy theories. Is</p>
<p>there some connection there to your thinking on religion? And it is curious. It&rsquo;s a matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious difficult thing. Uh, I don&rsquo;t understand why people believe things that</p>
<p>are clearly nonsense, like, well, flat earth and also the conspiracy about not landing</p>
<p>on the moon or, um, that, um, the, that the United States engineered 9 11 that, that kind</p>
<p>of thing. Um, so it&rsquo;s not clearly nonsense. It&rsquo;s extremely unlikely. Okay. It&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>unlikely that religion is a bit different because it&rsquo;s passed down from generation to</p>
<p>generation. So many of the people who are religious, uh, got it from their parents who</p>
<p>got it from their parents who got it from their parents and childhood indoctrination</p>
<p>is a very powerful force. But these things like the nine 11 conspiracy theory, the, um,</p>
<p>Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory, the man on the moon conspiracy theory, these are</p>
<p>not childhood indoctrination. These are, um, presumably dreamed up by somebody who then</p>
<p>tells somebody else who then wants to believe it. And I don&rsquo;t know why people are so eager</p>
<p>to fall in line with some, just some person that they happen to read or meet who spins</p>
<p>some yarn. I can kind of understand why they believe what their parents and teachers told</p>
<p>them when they were very tiny and not capable of critical thinking for themselves. So I</p>
<p>sort of get why the great religions of the world like Catholicism and Islam go on persisting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of childhood indoctrination, but that&rsquo;s not true of flat earthism and sure</p>
<p>enough flat earthism is a very minority cult way larger than I ever realized. Well, yes,</p>
<p>I know, but so that&rsquo;s a really clean idea and you&rsquo;ve articulated that in your new book</p>
<p>and then, and I&rsquo;ll go on God and in God, the illusion is the early indoctrination. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really interesting that you can get away with a lot of out there ideas in terms of religious</p>
<p>texts. If, um, the age at which you convey those ideas at first is a young age. So indoctrination</p>
<p>is sort of an essential element of propagation of religion. So let me ask on the morality</p>
<p>side in the books that I mentioned, God, delusion, and I&rsquo;ll go on God. You described that human</p>
<p>beings don&rsquo;t need religion to be moral. So from an engineering perspective, we want to</p>
<p>engineer morality into AI systems. So in general, where do you think morals come from in humans?</p>
<p>A very complicated and interesting question. It&rsquo;s clear to me that the moral standards,</p>
<p>the moral values of our civilization changes as the decades go by, certainly as the centuries</p>
<p>go by, even as the decades go by. And we in the 21st century are quite clearly labeled</p>
<p>21st century people in terms of our moral values. There&rsquo;s a spread. I mean, some of</p>
<p>us are a little bit more ruthless, some of us more conservative, some of us more liberal</p>
<p>and so on. But we all subscribe to pretty much the same views when you compare us with</p>
<p>say 18th century, 17th century people, even 19th century, 20th century people. So we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>much less racist, we&rsquo;re much less sexist and so on than we used to be. Some people are</p>
<p>still racist and some are still sexist, but the spread has shifted. The Gaussian distribution</p>
<p>has moved and moves steadily as the centuries go by. And that is the most powerful influence</p>
<p>I can see on our moral values. And that doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with religion. I mean,</p>
<p>the religion, sorry, the morals of the Old Testament are Bronze Age models. They&rsquo;re deplorable</p>
<p>and they are to be understood in terms of the people in the desert who made them up</p>
<p>at the time. And so human sacrifice, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, petty revenge,</p>
<p>killing people for breaking the Sabbath, all that kind of thing, inconceivable now.</p>
<p>So at some point religious texts may have in part reflected that Gaussian distribution</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they did. I&rsquo;m sure they always reflect that, yes.</p>
<p>And then now, but the sort of almost like the meme, as you describe it, of ideas moves</p>
<p>much faster than religious texts do, than new religions.</p>
<p>Yes. So basing your morals on religious texts, which were written millennia ago, is not a</p>
<p>great way to proceed. I think that&rsquo;s pretty clear. So not only should we not get our morals</p>
<p>from such texts, but we don&rsquo;t. We quite clearly don&rsquo;t. If we did, then we&rsquo;d be discriminating</p>
<p>against women and we&rsquo;d be racist, we&rsquo;d be killing homosexuals and so on. So we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and we shouldn&rsquo;t. Now, of course, it&rsquo;s possible to use your 21st century standards of morality</p>
<p>and you can look at the Bible and you can cherry pick particular verses which conform</p>
<p>to our modern morality, and you&rsquo;ll find that Jesus says some pretty nice things, which</p>
<p>is great. But you&rsquo;re using your 21st century morality to decide which verses to pick, which</p>
<p>verses to reject. And so why not cut out the middleman of the Bible and go straight to</p>
<p>the 21st century morality, which is where that comes from. It&rsquo;s a much more complicated</p>
<p>question. Why is it that morality, moral values change as the centuries go by? They undoubtedly</p>
<p>do. And it&rsquo;s a very interesting question to ask why. It&rsquo;s another example of cultural</p>
<p>evolution, just as technology progresses, so moral values progress for probably very</p>
<p>different reasons.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting if the direction in which that progress is happening has some evolutionary</p>
<p>value or if it&rsquo;s merely a drift that can go into any direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s any direction and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s evolutionarily valuable. What it</p>
<p>is is progressive in the sense that each step is a step in the same direction as the previous</p>
<p>step. So it becomes more gentle, more decent by modern standards, more liberal, less violent.</p>
<p>But more decent, I think you&rsquo;re using terms and interpreting everything in the context</p>
<p>of the 21st century because Genghis Khan would probably say that this is not more decent</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re now, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of weak members of society that we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>murdering.</p>
<p>Yes. I was careful to say by the standards of the 21st century, by our standards, if</p>
<p>we with hindsight look back at history, what we see is a trend in the direction towards</p>
<p>us, towards our present, our present value system.</p>
<p>For us, we see progress, but it&rsquo;s an open question whether that won&rsquo;t, you know, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see necessarily why we can never return to Genghis Khan times.</p>
<p>We could. I suspect we won&rsquo;t. But if you look at the history of moral values over the centuries,</p>
<p>it is in a progressive, I use the word progressive not in a value judgment sense, in the sense</p>
<p>of a transitive sense. Each step is the same, is the same direction as the previous step.</p>
<p>So things like we don&rsquo;t derive entertainment from torturing cats. We don&rsquo;t derive entertainment</p>
<p>from like the Romans did in the Colosseum from that state.</p>
<p>Or rather we suppress the desire to get, I mean, to have play. It&rsquo;s probably in us somewhere.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of parts of our brain, one that probably, you know, limbic system</p>
<p>that wants certain pleasures. And that&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t, I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have said that,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re at liberty to think that you like, well, no, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a Dan Carlin</p>
<p>of hardcore history. There&rsquo;s a really nice explanation of how we&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching</p>
<p>the torture of people, the fighting of people, just to torture the suffering of people throughout</p>
<p>history as entertainment until quite recently. And now everything we do with sports, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of channeling that feeling into something else. I mean, there, there is some dark aspects</p>
<p>of human nature that are underneath everything. And I do hope this like higher level software</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built will keep us at bay. I&rsquo;m also Jewish and have history with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the Holocaust. And I clearly remember that some of the darker aspects of human nature</p>
<p>creeped up there.</p>
<p>They do. There have been, there have been steps backwards admittedly, and the Holocaust</p>
<p>is an obvious one. But if you take a broad view of history, it&rsquo;s the same direction.</p>
<p>So Pamela McCordick in Machines Who Think has written that AI began with an ancient</p>
<p>wish to forge the gods. Do you see, it&rsquo;s a poetic description I suppose, but do you see</p>
<p>a connection between our civilizations, historic desire to create gods, to create religions</p>
<p>and our modern desire to create technology and intelligent technology?</p>
<p>I suppose there&rsquo;s a link between an ancient desire to explain away mystery and science,</p>
<p>but intelligence, artificial intelligence, creating gods, creating new gods. And I forget,</p>
<p>I read somewhere a somewhat facetious paper which said that we have a new god is called</p>
<p>Google and we pray to it and we worship it and we ask its advice like an Oracle and so</p>
<p>on. That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see that, you see that as a fun statement, a facetious statement. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that as a kind of truth of us creating things that are more powerful than ourselves</p>
<p>and natural.</p>
<p>It has a kind of poetic resonance to it, which I get, but I wouldn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered</p>
<p>to make the point myself, put it that way.</p>
<p>All right. So you don&rsquo;t think AI will become our new god, a new religion, a new gods like</p>
<p>Google?</p>
<p>Well, yes. I mean, I can see that the future of intelligent machines or indeed intelligent</p>
<p>aliens from outer space might yield beings that we would regard as gods in the sense</p>
<p>that they are so superior to us that we might as well worship them. That&rsquo;s highly plausible,</p>
<p>I think. But I see a very fundamental distinction between a god who is simply defined as something</p>
<p>very, very powerful and intelligent on the one hand and a god who doesn&rsquo;t need explaining</p>
<p>by a progressive step by step process like evolution or like engineering design. So suppose</p>
<p>we did meet an alien from outer space who was marvelously, magnificently more intelligent</p>
<p>than us and we would sort of worship it for that reason. Nevertheless, it would not be</p>
<p>a god in the very important sense that it did not just happen to be there like god is</p>
<p>supposed to. It must have come about by a gradual step by step incremental progressive</p>
<p>process, presumably like Darwinian evolution. There&rsquo;s all the difference in the world between</p>
<p>those two. Intelligence, design comes into the universe late as a product of a progressive</p>
<p>evolutionary process or progressive engineering design process.</p>
<p>So most of the work is done through this slow moving progress.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. But there&rsquo;s still this desire to get answers to the why question that if</p>
<p>the world is a simulation, if we&rsquo;re living in a simulation, that there&rsquo;s a programmer</p>
<p>like creature that we can ask questions of.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s pursue the idea that we&rsquo;re living in a simulation, which is not totally ridiculous,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Then you still need to explain the programmer. The programmer had to come into existence</p>
<p>by some&hellip; Even if we&rsquo;re in a simulation, the programmer must have evolved. Or if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in a sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Or she.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s in a meta simulation, then the meta program must have evolved by a gradual process.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t escape that. Fundamentally, you&rsquo;ve got to come back to a gradual incremental</p>
<p>process of explanation to start with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortcuts in this world.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>But maybe to linger on that point about the simulation, do you think it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing? Basically, you talk to&hellip; Bored the heck out of everybody asking this question,</p>
<p>but whether you live in a simulation, do you think&hellip; First, do you think we live in a</p>
<p>simulation? Second, do you think it&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly an interesting thought experiment. I first met it in a science fiction novel</p>
<p>by Daniel Galloy called Counterfeit World, in which it&rsquo;s all about&hellip; I mean, our heroes</p>
<p>are running a gigantic computer which simulates the world, and something goes wrong, and so</p>
<p>one of them has to go down into the simulated world in order to fix it. And then the denouement</p>
<p>of the thing, the climax to the novel, is that they discover that they themselves are</p>
<p>in another simulation at a higher level. So I was intrigued by this, and I love others</p>
<p>of Daniel Galloy&rsquo;s science fiction novels. Then it was revived seriously by Nick Bostrom&hellip;</p>
<p>Bostrom talking to him in an hour.</p>
<p>And he goes further, not just treat it as a science fiction speculation, he actually</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s positively likely. I mean, he thinks it&rsquo;s very likely, actually.</p>
<p>He makes a probabilistic argument, which you can use to come up with very interesting conclusions</p>
<p>about the nature of this universe.</p>
<p>I mean, he thinks that we&rsquo;re in a simulation done by, so to speak, our descendants of the</p>
<p>future. But it&rsquo;s still a product of evolution. It&rsquo;s still ultimately going to be a product</p>
<p>of evolution, even though the super intelligent people of the future have created our world,</p>
<p>and you and I are just a simulation, and this table is a simulation and so on. I don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>in my heart of hearts believe it, but I like his argument.</p>
<p>Well, so the interesting thing is that I agree with you, but the interesting thing to me,</p>
<p>if I were to say, if we&rsquo;re living in a simulation, that in that simulation, to make it work,</p>
<p>you still have to do everything gradually, just like you said. That even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>programmed, I don&rsquo;t think there could be miracles.</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, the programmer, the higher, the upper ones have to have evolved gradually.</p>
<p>However, the simulation they create could be instantaneous. I mean, they could be switched</p>
<p>on and we come into the world with fabricated memories.</p>
<p>True, but what I&rsquo;m trying to convey, so you&rsquo;re saying the broader statement, but I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective, both the programmer has to be slowly evolved and the</p>
<p>simulation because it&rsquo;s like, from an engineering perspective.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it takes a long time to write a program.</p>
<p>No, like just, I don&rsquo;t think you can create the universe in a snap. I think you have to</p>
<p>grow it.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, that&rsquo;s a good point. That&rsquo;s an arguable point. By the way, I have thought</p>
<p>about using the Nick Bostrom idea to solve the riddle of how you were talking. We were</p>
<p>talking earlier about why the human brain can achieve so much. I thought of this when</p>
<p>my then 100 year old mother was marveling at what I could do with a smartphone and I</p>
<p>could call, look up anything in the encyclopedia, I could play her music that she liked and</p>
<p>so on. She said, but it&rsquo;s all in that tiny little phone. No, it&rsquo;s out there. It&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the cloud. And maybe most of what we do is in a cloud. So maybe if we are a simulation,</p>
<p>even all the power that we think is in our skull, it actually may be like the power that</p>
<p>we think is in the iPhone. But is that actually out there in an interface to something else?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what, including Roger Penrose with panpsychism, that consciousness is somehow</p>
<p>a fundamental part of physics, that it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually all reside inside. But Roger</p>
<p>thinks it does reside in the skull, whereas I&rsquo;m suggesting that it doesn&rsquo;t, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a cloud.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a fascinating notion. On a small tangent, are you familiar with the work of</p>
<p>Donald Hoffman, I guess? Maybe not saying his name correctly, but just forget the name,</p>
<p>the idea that there&rsquo;s a difference between reality and perception. So like we biological</p>
<p>organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to be able to</p>
<p>survive and so on. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamental</p>
<p>reality, the physical reality underneath.</p>
<p>Well, I do think that although it reflects the fundamental reality, I do believe there</p>
<p>is a fundamental reality, I do think that our perception is constructive in the sense</p>
<p>that we construct in our minds a model of what we&rsquo;re seeing. And so this is really the</p>
<p>view of people who work on visual illusions, like Richard Gregory, who point out that things</p>
<p>like a Necker cube, which flip from a two dimensional picture of a cube on a sheet of</p>
<p>paper, we see it as a three dimensional cube, and it flips from one orientation to another</p>
<p>at regular intervals. What&rsquo;s going on is that the brain is constructing a cube, but the</p>
<p>sense data are compatible with two alternative cubes. And so rather than stick with one of</p>
<p>them, it alternates between them. I think that&rsquo;s just a model for what we do all the</p>
<p>time when we see a table, when we see a person, when we see anything, we&rsquo;re using the sense</p>
<p>data to construct or make use of a perhaps previously constructed model. I noticed this</p>
<p>when I meet somebody who actually is, say, a friend of mine, but until I kind of realized</p>
<p>that it is him, he looks different. And then when I finally clock that it&rsquo;s him, his features</p>
<p>switch like a Necker cube into the familiar form. As it were, I&rsquo;ve taken his face out</p>
<p>of the filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used the sense data to invoke it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter out</p>
<p>most of the sense data and make sense of it. That&rsquo;s just a magical thing that we do. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written several, many amazing books, but let me ask, what books, technical or fiction</p>
<p>or philosophical, had a big impact on your own life? What books would you recommend people</p>
<p>consider reading in their own intellectual journey?</p>
<p>Darwin, of course. The original. I&rsquo;m actually ashamed to say I&rsquo;ve never read Darwin. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>astonishingly prescient because considering he was writing in the middle of the 19th century,</p>
<p>Michael Gieselin said he&rsquo;s working 100 years ahead of his time. Everything except genetics</p>
<p>is amazingly right and amazingly far ahead of his time. And of course, you need to read</p>
<p>the updatings that have happened since his time as well. I mean, he would be astonished</p>
<p>by, well, let alone Watson and Crick, of course, but he&rsquo;d be astonished by Mendelian genetics</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be fascinating to see what he thought about DNA, what he would think about DNA.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, it would. Because in many ways, it clears up what appeared in his time to</p>
<p>be a riddle. The digital nature of genetics clears up what was a problem, what was a big</p>
<p>problem. Gosh, there&rsquo;s so much that I could think of. I can&rsquo;t really&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there something outside sort of more fiction? When you think young, was there books that</p>
<p>just kind of outside of kind of the realm of science or religion that just kind of sparked</p>
<p>your journey?</p>
<p>Yes. Well, actually, I suppose I could say that I&rsquo;ve learned some science from science</p>
<p>fiction. I mentioned Daniel Galloy, and that&rsquo;s one example, but another of his novels called</p>
<p>Dark Universe, which is not terribly well known, but it&rsquo;s a very, very nice science</p>
<p>fiction story. It&rsquo;s about a world of perpetual darkness. And we&rsquo;re not told at the beginning</p>
<p>of the book why these people are in darkness. They stumble around in some kind of underground</p>
<p>world of caverns and passages, using echolocation like bats and whales to get around. And they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>adapted, presumably by Darwinian means, to survive in perpetual total darkness. But what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting is that their mythology, their religion has echoes of Christianity, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on light. And so there&rsquo;s been a fall from a paradise world that once existed where</p>
<p>light reigns supreme. And because of the sin of mankind, light banished them. So they no</p>
<p>longer are in light&rsquo;s presence, but light survives in the form of mythology and in the</p>
<p>form of sayings like, there&rsquo;s a great light almighty. Oh, for light&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And I hear what you mean rather than I see what you mean.</p>
<p>So some of the same religious elements are present in this other totally kind of absurd</p>
<p>different form.</p>
<p>Yes. And so it&rsquo;s a wonderful, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it satire, because it&rsquo;s too good natured</p>
<p>for that. I mean, a wonderful parable about Christianity and the doctrine, the theological</p>
<p>doctrine of the fall. So I find that kind of science fiction immensely stimulating.</p>
<p>Fred Hoyle&rsquo;s The Black Cloud. Oh, by the way, anything by Arthur C. Clarke I find very wonderful</p>
<p>too. Fred Hoyle&rsquo;s The Black Cloud, his first science fiction novel, where he, well, I learned</p>
<p>a lot of science from that. It suffers from an obnoxious hero, unfortunately, but apart</p>
<p>from that, you learn a lot of science from it. Another of his novels, A for Andromeda,</p>
<p>which by the way, the theme of that is taken up by Carl Sagan&rsquo;s science fiction novel,</p>
<p>another wonderful writer, Carl Sagan, Contact, where the idea is, again, we will not be visited</p>
<p>from outer space by physical bodies. We will be visited possibly, we might be visited by</p>
<p>radio, but the radio signals could manipulate us and actually have a concrete influence</p>
<p>on the world if they make us or persuade us to build a computer, which runs their software.</p>
<p>So that they can then transmit their software by radio, and then the computer takes over</p>
<p>the world. And this is the same theme in both Hoyle&rsquo;s book and Sagan&rsquo;s book, I presume.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether Sagan knew about Hoyle&rsquo;s book, probably did. But it&rsquo;s a clever idea</p>
<p>that we will never be invaded by physical bodies. The War of the Worlds of H.G. Wells</p>
<p>will never happen. But we could be invaded by radio signals, code, coded information,</p>
<p>which is sort of like DNA. And we are, I call them, we are survival machines of our DNA.</p>
<p>So it has great resonance for me, because I think of us, I think of bodies, physical</p>
<p>bodies, biological bodies, as being manipulated by coded information, DNA, which has come</p>
<p>down through generations.</p>
<p>And in the space of memes, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be physical, it can be transmitted through</p>
<p>the space of information. That&rsquo;s a fascinating possibility, that from outer space we can</p>
<p>be infiltrated by other memes, by other ideas, and thereby controlled in that way. Let me</p>
<p>ask the last, the silliest, or maybe the most important question. What is the meaning of</p>
<p>life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, the meaning of life is the propagation of DNA, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what I feel. That&rsquo;s not the meaning of my life. So the meaning of my life is something</p>
<p>which is probably different from yours and different from other people&rsquo;s, but we each</p>
<p>make our own meaning. So we set up goals, we want to achieve, we want to write a book,</p>
<p>we want to do whatever it is we do, write a quartet, we want to win a football match.</p>
<p>And these are short term goals, well, maybe even quite long term goals, which are set</p>
<p>up by our brains, which have goal seeking machinery built into them. But what we feel,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t feel motivated by the desire to pass on our DNA, mostly. We have other goals which</p>
<p>can be very moving, very important. They could even be called as called spiritual in some</p>
<p>cases. We want to understand the riddle of the universe, we want to understand consciousness,</p>
<p>we want to understand how the brain works. These are all noble goals. Some of them can</p>
<p>be noble goals anyway. And they are a far cry from the fundamental biological goal,</p>
<p>which is the propagation of DNA. But the machinery that enables us to set up these higher level</p>
<p>goals is originally programmed into us by natural selection of DNA.</p>
<p>The propagation of DNA. But what do you make of this unfortunate fact that we are mortal?</p>
<p>Do you ponder your mortality? Does it make you sad?</p>
<p>I ponder it. It would, it makes me sad that I shall have to leave and not see what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen next. If there&rsquo;s something frightening about mortality, apart from sort of missing,</p>
<p>as I said, something more deeply, darkly frightening, it&rsquo;s the idea of eternity. But eternity is</p>
<p>only frightening if you&rsquo;re there. Eternity before we were born, billions of years before</p>
<p>we were born, and we were effectively dead before we were born. As I think it was Mark</p>
<p>Twain said, I was dead for billions of years before I was born and never suffered the smallest</p>
<p>inconvenience. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to be after we leave. So I think of it as really,</p>
<p>mortality is a frightening prospect. And so the best way to spend it is under a general</p>
<p>anesthetic, which is what it&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>Beautifully put. Richard, it is a huge honor to meet you, to talk to you. Thank you so</p>
<p>much for your time.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Dawkins. And thank you to our</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Richard Dawkins.</p>
<p>We are going to die. And that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to</p>
<p>die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here</p>
<p>in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains</p>
<p>of Arabia. Certainly, those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists</p>
<p>greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our</p>
<p>DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds,</p>
<p>it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few who won the lottery</p>
<p>of birth against all odds. How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state</p>
<p>from which the vast majority have never stirred.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
