    <p>What did your doctor give you to make you lose all this weight?</p>
<p>What is your celebrity doctor giving you?</p>
<p>Tell the truth.</p>
<p>Did you get that new shot?</p>
<p>People on Twitter are like,</p>
<p>your Twitter account&rsquo;s sounding a lot more like J-Cow.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I think we&rsquo;re on the same diet.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>In three, two&hellip;</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of The All In Pod.</p>
<p>With us today, of course, the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>And from his castle in Italy, the cackling dictator,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, nice gardenias.</p>
<p>And back from his big, big battle, his brawl,</p>
<p>unblocked and undefeated, the rain man himself, David Sacks.</p>
<p>And judging by the comments, I&rsquo;d say dominant.</p>
<p>Oh, you read the comments?</p>
<p>Just another sign of your obsession with how you&rsquo;re perceived.</p>
<p>I never read comments.</p>
<p>Rule number one, don&rsquo;t read the comments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing it again.</p>
<p>It shows because you&rsquo;re not listening to the comments.</p>
<p>So it makes sense.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>And you got your whole troll army?</p>
<p>How many people have you hired on your social media team</p>
<p>to troll me from anonymous accounts on Twitter now to prove your points?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re paranoid too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be paranoid.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be paranoid.</p>
<p>Anyway, look, we&rsquo;ve patched things up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s patched up.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t break the peace.</p>
<p>We have detente.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So Freeberg is busy writing tweet storms now about the drought in California,</p>
<p>which seems to be just going to be a really bad year, basically.</p>
<p>So Freeberg, walk us through it.</p>
<p>How bad is California&rsquo;s drought going to be this year?</p>
<p>So the drought is already very bad.</p>
<p>I put out a lot of tweets at two in the morning last night.</p>
<p>I think I drank way too much caffeine yesterday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the mountains.</p>
<p>And like the only way I can avoid having headaches is like drinking caffeine all day.</p>
<p>And it was a mistake.</p>
<p>It kept me up all night.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re so excited about this</p>
<p>that you just can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>Nick, you can beat this out.</p>
<p>Nick, you got to edit this shit out.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Keep that.</p>
<p>Keep that.</p>
<p>So, you know, the big tweet storm I put out at two in the morning last night kind of highlighted</p>
<p>that there was a paper published in 2018-2019 that showed how, you know, North America,</p>
<p>particularly the western half of North America is in this, you know, mega drought that we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen in, you know, 500 plus years.</p>
<p>And since that paper was published, you know, in 2019, conditions have only worsened.</p>
<p>We talked about this a few pods ago.</p>
<p>But like the snowpack level in California reached 0% throughout the entire state by</p>
<p>June 1st.</p>
<p>That has never happened before.</p>
<p>Temperatures in British Columbia, as you guys know, reached over 120 degrees for several</p>
<p>days in a row last week, which has never been seen in history in British Columbia.</p>
<p>You know, there was a paper published today that estimates that over a billion</p>
<p>animals and life forms were wiped out in the coastal region of British Columbia because</p>
<p>of this heat wave.</p>
<p>And the temperatures in California are obviously excessive as well, not as bad as they were</p>
<p>last year.</p>
<p>But what matters most is that the moisture conditions in our forest land is lower than</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever seen at this time of year in history.</p>
<p>And so this all sets us up and the other kind of big consequence, the high temperatures</p>
<p>is causing an increased demand for air conditioners.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big variable in power demand on all grids.</p>
<p>And the low snowpack means that we&rsquo;re not getting hydroelectric power.</p>
<p>Hydroelectric power is down by 70% in the state of California over where we were in</p>
<p>2019.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no snow that&rsquo;s melting causing the rivers to flow.</p>
<p>And about 11 to 15% of our state&rsquo;s electricity comes from hydroelectric power.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have more power demand, we have less power available.</p>
<p>We have extremely dry forests.</p>
<p>And so this is setting us up for a number of possible disasters this year.</p>
<p>And so rather than just trying to sound the alarm bells, what I&rsquo;m pointing out is that</p>
<p>there may be some things that we should be thinking about doing to try and get ahead</p>
<p>of some of the consequences of these, these big risks, like, you know, having enough masks</p>
<p>for people to breathe outside, so we don&rsquo;t have to shut down schools and shut down outdoor</p>
<p>work and all the things that might happen.</p>
<p>Having community centers that have power available, the state is scrambling to find excess power</p>
<p>on the grid right now.</p>
<p>But, you know, it just highlights that there&rsquo;s a moment here that is almost like where we</p>
<p>were going into COVID.</p>
<p>It may not happen, but the probability is high enough that something bad may happen</p>
<p>that we should probably start to get prepared for it.</p>
<p>You know, we should probably be talking about the things we&rsquo;re doing to get prepared for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about, we should be talking about the things we&rsquo;re going to do to make</p>
<p>sure that communities are safe and people are safe and businesses can keep operating.</p>
<p>Because if the state of California has 150 AQI, which is the air quality index, workers</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t work outside.</p>
<p>And all the outdoor work, which employs 3 million Californians has to shut down.</p>
<p>And you know, you kind of start to add these things up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what are we going to do as this happens, not if this happens, and we should</p>
<p>kind of be planning for it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see much happening in terms of planning and preparation and talking about</p>
<p>the opportunity.</p>
<p>History rhymes, because if you remember, and this is all going into a recall election in</p>
<p>the fall, this was a different but kind of equivalent setup where you guys remember,</p>
<p>we were having all these blackouts and brownouts when Gray Davis was recalled.</p>
<p>And then Schwarzenegger just swooped up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And, you know, people thought, oh, there&rsquo;s no chance.</p>
<p>And people were just frustrated because the quality of life took a measurable step backwards</p>
<p>in the intervening six or nine months before the recall election.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;ll be really interesting to see how Gavin Newsom manages all of this, because</p>
<p>if he can&rsquo;t get the state&rsquo;s act together, and you have all of these issues at hand,</p>
<p>and a credible candidate emerges, you could have some really interesting political fireworks</p>
<p>in September.</p>
<p>A big part of this, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, Friedberg, is that we live in essentially</p>
<p>like a lot of desert area here in California, and we just haven&rsquo;t invested in the desalinization</p>
<p>plants.</p>
<p>We have one that&rsquo;s come on since 2005.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s another one in SoCal that was mothballed, and they during the last drought</p>
<p>wanted to open it up again.</p>
<p>But we now have one in Carlsbad, the Clawed Bud, Lewis Carlsbad desalinization plant that</p>
<p>is now I think that cost us a billion bucks.</p>
<p>But Israel, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, is now they charge three times as much for water</p>
<p>than we do.</p>
<p>So people take water seriously, and they actually monitor their water usage.</p>
<p>And they have desalinization, and they have more water than they need per capita.</p>
<p>Well, desal doesn&rsquo;t really solve a number of these problems that I&rsquo;m highlighting, you</p>
<p>know, the probability of the forest land on the west coast, not just in California, but</p>
<p>all up and down the west coast catching on fire is very high.</p>
<p>No number of desal plants is going to put out those fires.</p>
<p>When that happens, the air quality is going to get really bad.</p>
<p>You know, like we saw last year, I don&rsquo;t know, you guys remember, I escaped to Lake</p>
<p>Michigan last summer, when the smoke hit.</p>
<p>Yeah, we remember the threads.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was, it was insane.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t desal plants don&rsquo;t solve the air quality problem where people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work outside, your kids can&rsquo;t go to school, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Desal plants don&rsquo;t solve the problem of hydroelectric plants, which require snowpack to melt to</p>
<p>get rivers to run to turn those turbines to generate electricity for the state.</p>
<p>Nuclear would solve that, though.</p>
<p>Nuclear would solve that, certainly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the point is, we&rsquo;re kind of reaching this apex of, are we going to</p>
<p>do climate change adaptation?</p>
<p>Are we going to have, you know, kind of long term systemic solutions that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start to put in place for these risks that we face?</p>
<p>And more importantly, from an acute perspective in the near term, what are the actions we</p>
<p>should be taking to protect communities and get ahead of this problem?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a scramble after the crisis, which is what we typically do with these sorts of</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not investing in infrastructure, if we put in some nuclear power plants, if we</p>
<p>did more de sal, and we did more forest management, or put more fire breaks into, you know, all</p>
<p>this, I&rsquo;m talking about a simple solutions, like, have those three things would be massive,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Well, those are long term solutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like for this summer, this summer, is it we need we need we need community</p>
<p>know, but we need to prepare for what is going to happen this summer.</p>
<p>So when communities get run out, what are we going to do, you know, do we have community</p>
<p>centers set up where people can get water and power?</p>
<p>Do we have masks available so that outdoor workers can keep working in the state?</p>
<p>You know, all of these things that we could be doing to get in front of the inevitable</p>
<p>consequences of these risks, I think are things that we should be actively</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in California, you should order your air purifiers.</p>
<p>Now, we ordered six more of the Conway ones that we used last year that were amazing.</p>
<p>Get and do it.</p>
<p>We have the N95 masks, we ordered them already.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to put in a power generator, which I know not everybody is able to do.</p>
<p>But you can buy a portable one for as little as three or 400 bucks, I think now.</p>
<p>So portable generator in case you lose power, stock up on everything else,</p>
<p>we need those solutions.</p>
<p>Like I think there&rsquo;s going to be a big kind of power generator push, right?</p>
<p>Like distributed power has always been something that&rsquo;s the whole point of solar,</p>
<p>you get the solar on your roof, you get your own power.</p>
<p>But how are you going to keep your AC running when it&rsquo;s 120 degrees outside if you have no</p>
<p>power?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s kind of a very scary circumstance of heat waves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that we should have a real plan around.</p>
<p>And if I were the governor, or if I were kind of California leadership,</p>
<p>or leadership up and down the West Coast, you know, the Western governors,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be running a daily press conference starting now, saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just get in front of this problem and talk about what are the risks we&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>what are the problems we&rsquo;re seeing, and what we&rsquo;re doing about it,</p>
<p>just so people feel reassured.</p>
<p>Because, you know, scrambling after a crisis doesn&rsquo;t make anyone feel better.</p>
<p>You know, showing that we&rsquo;re prepared, and we&rsquo;re taking action to get in front of this crisis,</p>
<p>which is not 100% certain, but it&rsquo;s a greater than 0% probability,</p>
<p>is something that could helpfully kind of reassure and start to put the pieces in place</p>
<p>for the near term.</p>
<p>By the way, just just for those that don&rsquo;t really appreciate how interconnected everything is the</p>
<p>basics, the science basics on drought, as I learned about them, were really, really incredible.</p>
<p>So you think, okay, well, how is all this stuff connected, it turns out that, you know,</p>
<p>as we have warmer and warmer temperatures, I didn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>Friedberg, you probably do this, but it accelerates soil evaporation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this really terrible feedback loop that starts, which is you have drier soil,</p>
<p>which means you have less vegetation.</p>
<p>And then as a result, you have less what&rsquo;s called evapotranspiration,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s less regional precipitation.</p>
<p>And then this whole thing just starts to spin and spin and spin,</p>
<p>you have warmer temperatures that results in less snowpack, the snowpack, the snowpack melts</p>
<p>earlier. And we have a situation now in the United States, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>I saw a graph, which is one of soil moisture.</p>
<p>And it shows basically the western half of the United States is in the first percentile</p>
<p>of soil moisture, looking back over many, many decades.</p>
<p>So well, then all of that vegetation dries up, and then it becomes fodder for more fires.</p>
<p>No, Jason, we&rsquo;re even worse than this, we&rsquo;re in a position where,</p>
<p>you know, we are threatening our own food supply.</p>
<p>And just just to just to put a finer point on this, it&rsquo;s not just the western half of</p>
<p>the United States, that&rsquo;s now suffering from this, it&rsquo;s Brazil, it&rsquo;s the Mediterranean</p>
<p>and southern Europe, and it&rsquo;s large parts of Africa, you add up all those number of people,</p>
<p>there are many countries there that are actually self sufficient, which will then no longer be</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have to import food, that food quality is, you know, questionable at best in some cases.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in a really tough position here.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t this all solvable with technology?</p>
<p>I mean, if we just tax people a little more for the water usage, if we really invested</p>
<p>in the desal plants, if we really invested in nuclear, we could actually flip this whole thing</p>
<p>the same way it&rsquo;s spiraling in the wrong direction, it could spiral in the right direction.</p>
<p>Two things on the water side, I&rsquo;ve been looking at water investing for a while,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a real problem, which is, you know, when I when I looked at this,</p>
<p>my team found some incredibly interesting opportunities, largely,</p>
<p>it evolves around owning water rights, right, and then basically selling them back to the state.</p>
<p>And when states get in difficult situations, the problem is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s politically intolerable for, let&rsquo;s just say somebody like me,</p>
<p>to own those kinds of water.</p>
<p>To be a water baron.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s no bueno. The idea then that I had was like, well,</p>
<p>maybe what we should be doing is buying these things and sticking them in a foundation so</p>
<p>that we can guarantee water for people in certain states. Maybe that flies, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s job. And but then they&rsquo;re not doing their job.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re incompetent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unfortunately not, not as skilled as you&rsquo;d want them to be on this stuff.</p>
<p>Saks, how would you spin this out of this death spiral and into abundance? Is there a way?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the first thing to realize here is that this is not a black swan event. I mean,</p>
<p>this is entirely foreseeable. Drought conditions have existed in California for a long time.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>200 years. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and even maybe going back millions of years. I mean, geologists have found evidence that,</p>
<p>you know, millions of years ago, you would have millions of acres of California burning every</p>
<p>year. And so drought conditions have existed for a long time. Has climate change amplified</p>
<p>that and made it worse? Yes. But this is entirely foreseeable. We know we&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with these conditions. And in fact, back on his first day in office in 2019,</p>
<p>Newsom held his very first press conference about this issue on emergency preparedness for fires.</p>
<p>But the problem is, there has been no follow through. And so, you know, to go back to Chamath&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point about the political ramifications here, you could have a Gray Davis-like situation with</p>
<p>the recall where all of a sudden Newsom goes from being the favorite to potentially losing</p>
<p>because of fire season. But by the way, I mean, the whole reason why the recall election is</p>
<p>happening in September now instead of October, November is because Newsom is precisely worried</p>
<p>about the Gray Davis scenario. And this recall is supposed to happen in the October, November</p>
<p>timeframe. They&rsquo;ve moved it up to September because Newsom thinks there&rsquo;s a higher chance of fading</p>
<p>the worst of fire season by doing the election sooner. The problem for him is that fire season</p>
<p>now starts in August. And so, we could be in the middle of fire season when this recall election</p>
<p>happens. And this thing could boomerang on him. But back to the point about, you know,</p>
<p>Newsom held this press conference back in January of 2019. And the problem is,</p>
<p>there hasn&rsquo;t been any real follow through on forest management. So, you know, Newsom was</p>
<p>recently caught in a lie saying that, you know, they had basically treated 90,000 acres,</p>
<p>this is what this article I put in the chat said, in reality, that only really treated about 11,000</p>
<p>acres, even 90,000 would be inadequate, right? They&rsquo;re not doing enough. And the way, you know,</p>
<p>I talked to a very prominent person who knows California politics well and knows all the</p>
<p>players. And what he said is, look, the fundamental problem is that Gavin is not operational,</p>
<p>right? He&rsquo;s fantastic at fundraising. He says all the right things at press conferences.</p>
<p>Right here, right here.</p>
<p>But not everything is about running for re-election. And the problem is, he has not</p>
<p>managed to this outcome. And so, now we&rsquo;re in the situation where, to Freedberg&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be scrambling after the fact. Now, what is Newsom&rsquo;s excuse going to be? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be, you know, climate change. It&rsquo;s going to be global warming. It&rsquo;s kind of the all-purpose</p>
<p>dog ate my homework excuse for anything that goes wrong is that he can just blame it on climate</p>
<p>change. But the reality is, we knew about climate change. Climate change is something we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to live with. Even if we stop it in its tracks from this point forward, we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be able to reverse the effects it&rsquo;s already had. And so, we need leaders who will step up and</p>
<p>get much more aggressive about preventing this problem. I think, and by the way, my tweet,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention climate change at all. I got, you know, I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s even the point.</p>
<p>The point is, we are facing acute conditions on the, in the western half of the United States</p>
<p>right now, that lead to a number of significant and severe consequences. Those acute conditions,</p>
<p>you know, you could blame them on climate change or say that they&rsquo;re part of climate change,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t change the reality. They are here today, and we have to deal with them. And I think</p>
<p>yeah, we have a we have a couple of things that are that are going to happen here in short order</p>
<p>that I think can make this thing accelerated a little. So there&rsquo;s a an organization, a department</p>
<p>in the United States government that&rsquo;s not very well known called the US Bureau of Reclamation,</p>
<p>USBR. And they are the ones that will make formal assessments of water levels. And there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>important assessment that&rsquo;s going to happen in Lake Mead at the end of this year. And the reason</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s critical is that if the US Bureau of Reclamation measures Lake Mead under a certain</p>
<p>threshold, they can declare a tier one shortage. And what that means, just practically speaking,</p>
<p>cutting through all the, you know, jargon is that initially, the state of Arizona will be denied</p>
<p>around 600,000 acre feet of water next year. What does that mean? That&rsquo;s about 15% of the demand for</p>
<p>that state. And so you&rsquo;re going to start, you know, to deal with these sort of like rolling,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re even going to call these water out scenarios where it&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>watering your lawn, that&rsquo;s not going to be possible, it&rsquo;s going to be a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>things. Now, there is a solution. And this is where California can come to the rescue for most of the</p>
<p>Western United States if they really want to, or at least for the rest of California, which is</p>
<p>there is an enormous untapped groundwater aquifer in Southern California, which is the size of Lake</p>
<p>Mead. It&rsquo;s an incredibly unique thing. It&rsquo;s actually owned by a public company.</p>
<p>And the whole goal was, okay, well, let&rsquo;s just build a pipeline, right from the aquifer to</p>
<p>deliver drinking water to folks that, you know, are lacking water. And this has been a multi year,</p>
<p>you know, bordering on multi decades slog because of California politicians,</p>
<p>because water has become highly politicized, no one wants to pay the full cost for a commodity</p>
<p>that they frankly view as a right, but then they don&rsquo;t want to step in to do the work</p>
<p>to actually make it reasonable and viable. So this whole thing is just again, as David,</p>
<p>as you said, the dog ate my homework. And now we&rsquo;re really playing with some very complicated</p>
<p>things that are really out of the control and intellectual capacity of the frankly state</p>
<p>governments, which is the interconnectedness of weather, temperature, water or soil or food</p>
<p>supply. It&rsquo;s a I think what&rsquo;s so frustrating, this is this is so easily solvable. And we are not</p>
<p>doing the blocking and tackling the free throws the basic things. If you look at just monitoring</p>
<p>our water usage, I invested in two companies, one of them didn&rsquo;t work out. But both of them were to</p>
<p>monitor water usage. And what we learned was at a campus like Stanford, they have like four water</p>
<p>meters, like they&rsquo;re not going down to the building level, in some cases, there&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>four buildings on one water meter. And you can very easily at each sink at each, you know,</p>
<p>showerhead, you can put a device that costs 25 bucks installed, it just wraps around the the</p>
<p>water, the the pipe, and it could tell you how it&rsquo;s flowing. And we lose 20 30% of our water to</p>
<p>leaks. Nobody is monitoring their usage, because there is no cost to it to match point. And then</p>
<p>you look at these crazy, insane, almond and other agriculture in the middle of California.</p>
<p>They are using flood irrigation, which I&rsquo;m sure Friedberg can give us an education at versus what</p>
<p>you know, the drip irrigation that they use and other reclaiming methods in Israel and other</p>
<p>places. So we look at water as like, to Tramont&rsquo;s point, some crazy, God given right that we can</p>
<p>just splash it everywhere, we can take 20 minute showers. And then we allow how crazy is this,</p>
<p>we allow the bottling of water in California, we allow these companies to bottle water and then</p>
<p>sell it. And we don&rsquo;t even monitor our usage. We have well, we are so entitled, it is gross,</p>
<p>nuisance biggest donors. Who&rsquo;s that family that grows all the almonds or whatever?</p>
<p>Whoever they are, the Resnick&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the Resnick&rsquo;s single biggest, them and the teachers union signals.</p>
<p>Oh, Linda Resnick and those palm people with the palm stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s total political corruption, right? I mean, they get</p>
<p>Chinatown. It&rsquo;s literally the movie Chinatown.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think so to this point about why aren&rsquo;t politicians solving the problems? I mean,</p>
<p>to make a meta point, there&rsquo;s a great tweet from Thomas soul or the person who manages</p>
<p>the Thomas soul account, where he said, no one will really understand politics until they</p>
<p>understand that politicians are not trying to solve our problems. They&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>their own problems, which are getting elected and reelected. That&rsquo;s number one, number two.</p>
<p>Stay in office. That is their only goal.</p>
<p>Whatever is number three is far behind. And that&rsquo;s basically the situation we have is,</p>
<p>I think Newsom actually is a little bit like Trump, not in his personal style, but in that</p>
<p>he thinks he can talk his way out of problems. And he&rsquo;s not going to focus on solving a problem</p>
<p>when he can just spin his way out of it. By the way, I just think you guys should know</p>
<p>the you know, because a lot of people talk about residential water use, that is also kind of an</p>
<p>acute and local problem, where depending on your water supply, how much water you have available</p>
<p>to your community. But in terms of aggregate water use, the vast majority of water in California is</p>
<p>used in agriculture. It&rsquo;s about 10x what is used for residential applications. So California</p>
<p>agriculture, by the way, it&rsquo;s not a bad thing. It&rsquo;s a huge part of our economy, that water has</p>
<p>generally been fully available in aquifers, people bought that land with rights, they paid a premium</p>
<p>for those rights to those aquifers. This is a very complicated problem in California. And that,</p>
<p>you know, supports a large part of the California economy. So you know, you can&rsquo;t just kind of blow</p>
<p>them away. But 90% of water use in California is associated with ag. And it&rsquo;s not just a generally</p>
<p>we need to save water problem. It&rsquo;s very specific to a region and a community and their particular</p>
<p>water source on whether and how much you need to save versus do you have abundant supplies and so</p>
<p>on. And so it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated, but yeah, but we should be focused on abundance,</p>
<p>Freeberg. If you look at the new nuclear power plants that you know, Bill Gates has invested in,</p>
<p>and then you look at desalinization, which is an energy issue, we can desalinize for roughly two</p>
<p>or three times the cost that we&rsquo;re getting more water for now. So just put a nuclear power plant</p>
<p>next to a desalinization plant, and you&rsquo;re done. Great. That&rsquo;s a 20 year project. And you got</p>
<p>why? Why is it a 20 year project? China does it in two, you got to be more bold in this country.</p>
<p>It is completely ridiculous that we accept that everything has to take 20 years. We need this now.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the leadership that says, fuck it, let&rsquo;s do it immediately. Let&rsquo;s set a goal of two years</p>
<p>to build 10 of these. And let&rsquo;s spend the fucking money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it solves our acute problems. It solves long term problems associated with climate</p>
<p>change and energy. We can&rsquo;t do both. Let&rsquo;s do both. Sure, we should do everything. But right now,</p>
<p>you know, the conditions indicate that there are some specific things that we can and should be</p>
<p>doing to kind of support the state in terms of what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next year or two.</p>
<p>And yes, we should also be funding long term projects that create water security and energy</p>
<p>security for everyone in the United States. But Saks, to your point, and by the way, if you guys</p>
<p>ever want to read an interesting book about how the grid operates, there&rsquo;s a book called The Grid.</p>
<p>And it talks about how the electrical power grid system was built in the United States and how</p>
<p>inefficient it is and all the problems. There are a lot of structural problems that need to be solved,</p>
<p>not just, you know, dropping in cheap power. Saks, who is the good operational candidate</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen that&rsquo;s running for governor of California in this recall? Is there someone that</p>
<p>stands out in your mind? Because I don&rsquo;t seem to hear anyone talking about, hey, there&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>alternative to Gavin Newsom at this point. Yeah, I mean, we don&rsquo;t a clear alternative has not</p>
<p>emerged yet. You know, I guess the and part of the problem is that because there was no</p>
<p>Republican primary, you haven&rsquo;t sort of consolidated the opposition to a leading</p>
<p>candidate. There are a couple of, I guess, interesting candidates on the Republican side,</p>
<p>I need to spend more time getting to, you know, know them. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never met them or talked</p>
<p>to them. But the two who are, I think, mentioned quite a bit are this guy, Faulkner, who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mayor of San Diego, who is sort of a socially liberal Republican. And then there&rsquo;s a state</p>
<p>assemblyman named Kevin Kiley, who I think says a lot of interesting things. And he just announced</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s running. There&rsquo;s another guy as well, John Cox, but he got trounced by Newsom in the last</p>
<p>election, I think it&rsquo;s time to let somebody else take a shot against him. And then of course,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got Caitlyn Jenner, but I think people are still trying to figure out if her campaign</p>
<p>is real or how real it is. So yeah, look, we the opposition has not consolidated against Newsom,</p>
<p>the way it did with Schwarzenegger, you know, back in 2001,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m voting, I&rsquo;m voting Republican, just to create a counterbalance. I don&rsquo;t care who it is. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a Republican, I&rsquo;m an independent, but I&rsquo;m voting across the board, I&rsquo;m just going to go</p>
<p>to Republican for every position in California. And I&rsquo;m going to just run my finger down the</p>
<p>Republican line and check every single one. How does it feel to be a radical Trump supporter?</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m not for Trump, but Chamath, talk to us about nuclear and what we can do to get to</p>
<p>reverse what these hippie, dippy, well intentioned, no nukes concert, set us back 50 years. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>be honest, a lot of the climate change problems we have today, we would not have if we had invested</p>
<p>in nuclear. Yeah, I sent her around. Well, I sent her on an image, Nick, maybe you can stick it in</p>
<p>the show notes or something so that people can see but if you if you look at if you graph the</p>
<p>construction of nuclear reactors from the 1960s 1960s to today, essentially what and you color</p>
<p>code them by country, what essentially you see is a transition from the able from the frankly,</p>
<p>from countries that basically were just right at the leading the pack, and it was really the United</p>
<p>States, building, building, building, and then two things really happened. There was Three Mile</p>
<p>Island, and then there was Chernobyl. And there was an incredible overreaction to not really</p>
<p>understanding either the cause and or the remediation to two events. Now, could you</p>
<p>imagine if there were two airlines that crashed, and we stopped flying? How, basically, we would</p>
<p>have, you know, retarded the progress of the world. And now you impose it on something like nuclear</p>
<p>energy, which is consistently proven to provide an enormous, the abundant, cheap, and clean form</p>
<p>of sustainable energy. And it actually solves a bunch of the problems we talked about before. So</p>
<p>for example, if you look at the power consumption for desalination, it&rsquo;s off the charts, quite</p>
<p>honestly, okay, that&rsquo;s why people say that it can&rsquo;t be done credibly. If you look at even just</p>
<p>like the amount of energy that&rsquo;s required to clean water and to, you know, sanitize water and make it</p>
<p>drinkable. The the standards that are defined by the government are incredibly stringent, but the</p>
<p>implication of it operationally is an enormous amount of power that goes into it. But Jason,</p>
<p>you are right, which is that if we have small forms of sustainable, abundant energy that can</p>
<p>be basically hyper localized and located where we can do these jobs, the jobs to be done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s transformational. Now, why doesn&rsquo;t it happen? It doesn&rsquo;t happen because the same folks who</p>
<p>really want to sound the alarm bells on climate change, which is the progressive left, are not</p>
<p>really willing, they&rsquo;re intellectually lazy when it comes to nuclear, they don&rsquo;t do the work.</p>
<p>They make a brand sort of broad based prognostication about how we need to do something</p>
<p>about climate, then they will point to solar and wind without really understanding the contamination</p>
<p>of the earth that we do in order to mine the rare earths and the actual metal and mineral inputs</p>
<p>that are required for solar. It&rsquo;s yes, nuts. But it sounds better, right? It sounds better.</p>
<p>It sounds better. Oh, we&rsquo;re using air and the sun and water.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if I could show you what tailings are, and like the dirty after effects of mining</p>
<p>copper and nickel out of the ground, which is what we need for batteries, and how countries</p>
<p>like Indonesia are literally dumping it into the ocean, dumping it faster that they can get their</p>
<p>hands on it so that they can sell copper and nickel and cobalt to us so that we can make</p>
<p>batteries, you would actually say to yourself, if you knew all these facts, you&rsquo;d actually say to</p>
<p>yourself, you know what, maybe nuclear isn&rsquo;t so bad. And maybe I overreacted to do you want to</p>
<p>understand this, you just have to look at the laziest group of individuals in society, the</p>
<p>French, they want to take the laziest route and do the least amount of work and have the most amount</p>
<p>of leisure. Sorry to our French listeners. 70% of the energy in France is from nuclear nuclear</p>
<p>figured this out. They said, How do we take more time off and not work and have unlimited</p>
<p>electric 70% nuclear? They&rsquo;re smart. Well, the French are actually smart, because after</p>
<p>Fukushima, because after Fukushima, what happened is if you had, you know, sort of like woke</p>
<p>politicians, Germany, a bunch of Germany, they completely unwound their entire nuclear agenda,</p>
<p>shut it down, which, which was insanity, insanity. And so now here they are, they&rsquo;re writing laws</p>
<p>faster than they can make them up. They&rsquo;re basically pivoting entire industries to try to</p>
<p>now adopt batteries and storage without any real understanding about the downstream implications</p>
<p>to the earth that they are going to create the net consequences. If they had just stayed the</p>
<p>course on nuclear, they would be in a much better place. And to Francis credit, they were like,</p>
<p>what the fuck are you people overreacting about? Again, just think about this, guys,</p>
<p>the pragmatism is delightful stopped flying. After two airline crashes, where would the world be?</p>
<p>Where would the world be? I mean, be pragmatists here? What do we want to deal with high energy</p>
<p>prices, and brownouts and all kinds of problems and rolling blackouts? Or do we want to put this</p>
<p>issue behind us? If we just go on a Manhattan project, literally to make new nuclear, we would</p>
<p>be this issue would be behind us. And we could focus on something else like education. It&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>dumb. The very scary thing about nuclear is despite all of the progress, it will get bogged</p>
<p>down in litigation and bureaucracy. These are the last two things that should be in front of science</p>
<p>and physics, especially when it comes to energy independence. I just think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy. Anyway, out any way we can get people to what&rsquo;s the best way to convince the American</p>
<p>public to embrace nuclear and force our politicians to do it. Open your mind and think for yourself.</p>
<p>Right, please. Well,</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen had a good term. He said we&rsquo;re living in a V talker see as in the word veto.</p>
<p>I think it was an interesting interview with Antonio Garcia Martinez on his blog. Anyway,</p>
<p>yeah, they were talking about the inability of the US to build anything anymore,</p>
<p>especially when you compare us to some place like China. And whether you want to call it</p>
<p>nimbyism or vetocracy, there are just too many people and groups who have the right to say no</p>
<p>to anything and block anything important from happening. But we got to we got to stop letting</p>
<p>our politicians off the hook by making excuses, you know, just because there&rsquo;s climate change</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that the politicians can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>I mean, welcome to the downstream consequences of a successful democracy. Right? Like a democracy</p>
<p>over time doesn&rsquo;t reduce the number of laws it has. Every year politicians need to do their job</p>
<p>and they create new laws. As new laws accumulate, like the things get clogged up, right? Like,</p>
<p>when have you seen a law that gets passed by a local government, a state government or federal</p>
<p>government that makes it easier to do something? I get that. But where where does it say in the</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States that being part of a democracy also means shutting your brain off</p>
<p>and becoming a dumb cynic? Yeah, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not part of what being part of a democracy is.</p>
<p>I by the way, I want to I want to talk about that for one second. There was this thing</p>
<p>that I sent you guys in the chat. And Nick, hopefully you post post that in the show notes</p>
<p>as well. But there was a study that was done about cynicism. And it went back and it did like</p>
<p>a qualitative assessment of more than 200,000 people, and their attitudes and their measured</p>
<p>IQ, their measured literacy, their measured numeracy, and their measured earnings. And</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what they found. cynicism is associated with lower IQ, lower literacy, lower numeracy</p>
<p>and lower earnings. The idea of cynical individuals being more competent, appears to be</p>
<p>a widespread, yet largely illusory lie. So I think, I think this makes sense. I mean, I was shocked by</p>
<p>that study, because I actually generally think cynical people must be smarter, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking more rationally. And maybe I&rsquo;m being emotional. It turns out they&rsquo;re fucking stupid.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing. There&rsquo;s cynicism. And then there&rsquo;s people who are cantankerous and</p>
<p>not content. And I think people sometimes conflate those two things. If you look at the constant,</p>
<p>constant, pervasive cynicism is not a feature of democracy. It means that you just stop thinking</p>
<p>for yourself as a protective mechanism, right? But but the people we know, who have changed the</p>
<p>world and who they seem to be, they&rsquo;re not cynical. They&rsquo;re not cynical. They&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>delusional and optimistic, or as they wouldn&rsquo;t have started a company to make electric cars,</p>
<p>you know, or, you know, whatever piece of software or climate.com, or synthetic biology,</p>
<p>you have to be a radical optimist. I mean, we&rsquo;re literally trying to attack our incredible</p>
<p>capitalists who are actually solving these problems, while our politicians can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their shit together and make diesel plants and nuclear plants. The private market seems</p>
<p>like the only solution sacks. Well, there&rsquo;s an old saying that pessimists get to be right,</p>
<p>and optimists get to be rich. And, yeah. If you think about it, you know, pessimists don&rsquo;t create</p>
<p>companies, right? They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re no rocks, they become journalists. They become shit posters on</p>
<p>Twitter. They become critics. Yeah. Anton Ego, right? Sax, what do you think about this idea</p>
<p>that, you know, if we get into the throes of it, for water, the folks that own water rights,</p>
<p>I think that this is going to be like an eminent domain issue where the government is at some</p>
<p>point just going to say, sorry, need it back. It&rsquo;s mine. Yeah, during an emergency, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure. But I mean, I hate to, I hate to use the words, I agree with Jay cow, but</p>
<p>but you know, look, there&rsquo;s not a shortage of water in the world, right? I mean, the world</p>
<p>is mostly water. So it is a function of building desalination plants, if that&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>There has to be a solution for that problem. And Freeberg&rsquo;s right that maybe it does take</p>
<p>a decade or two to put in place all that infrastructure. But then why didn&rsquo;t we start</p>
<p>10 years ago? You see, we should be starting a program where we convince the American public</p>
<p>that abundance would lead to them having more freedom, and our country being stronger,</p>
<p>electrical abundance with nuclear water abundance with desalinization, and agricultural abundance</p>
<p>with those previous two, because if you had unlimited nuclear energy, and you had a limited</p>
<p>clean water, the price of agriculture will go down, and we&rsquo;d have more free food for everybody</p>
<p>or lower cost food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;ll tell you a theory I have on this. And it&rsquo;s basically an anti science theory,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, culturally, we&rsquo;ve kind of developed this anti innovation,</p>
<p>anti science mentality, broadly speaking, across kind of modern culture in the United States.</p>
<p>If you remember coming out of World War Two, and I think it has its roots in the Cold War.</p>
<p>You know, out of when World War Two ended, you know, we were all in it together,</p>
<p>you know, this country, everyone bought the same stuff. We all had Rice Krispies every day,</p>
<p>we all kind of, you know, we&rsquo;re excited about our homes that look like everyone else&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>on the block. And technology was empowering all of this, right? There was a space race on</p>
<p>there were plastics that were suddenly allowing us to make all sorts of amazing things.</p>
<p>There were chemicals that were creating new drugs for humans, and new applications for</p>
<p>agriculture that was making an abundance of food, and increasing lifespans and so on.</p>
<p>But then what happened in the late 60s and 70s, is we realized we got ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was cancer from DDT, there was, you know, Three Mile Island, there was</p>
<p>a number of pollutants that got into the environment that permanently damaged the</p>
<p>environment from chemical companies. And we started to wake up and say, like, wait a second,</p>
<p>all of this technology that we thought was so great, and was giving us this extraordinary</p>
<p>abundance, it turns out is really risky and can cause massive unknown consequences.</p>
<p>And if you watch, I think I talked about this on our podcast once, but one of my favorite videos</p>
<p>to watch, there&rsquo;s a video on YouTube from the Disney Channel History Institute. And they show</p>
<p>the history of Tomorrowland at Disneyland. When Tomorrowland opened in 1955, every ride was all</p>
<p>about adventuring into space and like traveling into the human body. And they even had a ride</p>
<p>from Monsanto where you would go into the micro world and look at plastics and stuff. And it was</p>
<p>all about this amazing abundance in technology. And the guy, the narrator on the video says,</p>
<p>beginning in the late 60s, early 70s, we changed all the rides. And the rides all became about the</p>
<p>fear of technology. It was all about aliens attacking Earth. It was all about Captain EO</p>
<p>was like, you know, the world became robotic and got taken over by unnatural things.</p>
<p>Even Star Tours was about a robot that went awry. And the robot doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s doing. So,</p>
<p>it drove us off course and we had to survive the robot. And so, everything became, you know,</p>
<p>subconscious or subliminally a little bit, this negative technology sentiment. And I think that</p>
<p>that still persists, you know, there is an asymmetry people take for granted the abundance</p>
<p>over time, because you get used to it. But you feel the acute pain of the loss when technology</p>
<p>goes awry. And then that becomes the social conscience. And I think we&rsquo;re still grappling</p>
<p>with that. And I don&rsquo;t know how you reverse it. Because you know what, are we not experiencing</p>
<p>this right now, everybody with COVID, where there&rsquo;s one group of people who are like, Oh, my</p>
<p>God, the science we were able to deploy in COVID and get through this so quickly is so promising</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s going to be better. net net after the pandemic, even with all the suffering,</p>
<p>you could make an argument that that suffering is going to lead to more prosperity. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another group of people who are like the delta variant, let&rsquo;s get our masks back on. And people</p>
<p>want to take the cynical route as an individual, I don&rsquo;t want harm done to me or my kids or my</p>
<p>environment. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the I think the general kind of conscience, right? And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about the abundance, because I&rsquo;ve basically taken it for granted. And so now I find myself as</p>
<p>an individual saying, you know what, we shouldn&rsquo;t do nuclear because look at what happened in</p>
<p>Fukushima, forgetting the fact that you&rsquo;ve been living off of free electricity, practically for</p>
<p>decades, or whatever the you know, the case might be water and free water and all these things. And</p>
<p>I think that the abundance that technology delivers to humans, because humans are only</p>
<p>programmed to recognize change, they&rsquo;re not programmed to recognize absolutes. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of good socio psychological and evolutionary. Give us an example of that. Give us an example.</p>
<p>Like if you know, if you go to the store every day, and you&rsquo;re used to just getting a $1 can</p>
<p>of Coke, you don&rsquo;t say oh my god, I feel it&rsquo;s an amazing world I live in, I get a $1 can of Coke,</p>
<p>you never praise that $1 can of Coke. Now, if you went to the store, and the can of Coke went up to</p>
<p>$2, you&rsquo;d be like, what the heck, why does Coke cost so much? And so, you know,</p>
<p>we habituate to the great things in our life, the price of Coke dropped to 50 cents,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, that feels good. And then you get used to the price of Coke being 50 cents. And</p>
<p>a few weeks later, if it goes up, you&rsquo;re upset, but you&rsquo;re not as happy on the other way. So</p>
<p>human emotion is kind of asymmetrically, you know, defined by these negative consequences.</p>
<p>And I think over time, you accumulate these negative consequences as your core psyche,</p>
<p>and you have an aversion to doing, you know, innovative things as a whole, not all people,</p>
<p>but as a whole, that&rsquo;s how we operate. And it&rsquo;s why technology kind of gets lambasted over over</p>
<p>time. This is the most frustrating thing to me, Chamath is that we have so many amazing</p>
<p>things happening in technology. And nobody will 10x or 100x on them from the government perspective</p>
<p>of the public. I had a company called zero mass on my podcast, which I think is now called source</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re aware of this company, maybe you could talk a little bit about the impact hydro panels</p>
<p>would make if we just embrace this technology. Well, I mean, source source is an incredible,</p>
<p>incredible company. Basically, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a guy who runs a Cody Friesen, who when he was at</p>
<p>MIT, basically developed a essentially a material membrane that can absorb the ambient water that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the atmosphere, and basically allow you to collect it and to separate it into its components</p>
<p>and to basically create potable salinized or potable drinkable water in a panel that looks</p>
<p>like a solar panel. So you put these solar arrays everywhere. And out of the back, you put a little</p>
<p>pipe and it collects the humidity in the ambient air and, and it spits out water. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible thing. And he&rsquo;s able to go and rewire schools. And, and the thing is, he can go anywhere</p>
<p>because again, he doesn&rsquo;t need anything, right? You literally put it on your roof. It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And it makes you if you I think he told me at the time when I interviewed him two or three years ago.</p>
<p>He said you could put two of these on your roof and get like four cases of bottled water a day,</p>
<p>no matter where you were on the planet. And by the way, he&rsquo;s moving to a place which is really cool.</p>
<p>He told me this. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m allowed to say but I&rsquo;ll say it anyways. Are you saying this</p>
<p>might be beeped? No, where he&rsquo;s gonna be candidate? No, he&rsquo;ll have an eventual app,</p>
<p>where you can kind of direct the hydro panel to make the kind of water that you like. So if you</p>
<p>love alkaline, or if you love dial it in water, or if you love smart water, or you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>vault, right? Specifically because it&rsquo;s the most expensive. I love I love smart water.</p>
<p>I have a very gratuitous reason why I remember when I met jobs, he drank smart water and</p>
<p>is good enough for him is good enough for me. I just get a copy people. I get you got to copy</p>
<p>the good ones. And I was just like, this is a personal anecdote. This is when I knew Chamath</p>
<p>made it. We used to play poker in his garage in his little 3000 square foot Palo Alto house.</p>
<p>Burlington Berlin in Berlin, whatever he had this little tiny house. And we&rsquo;re in the garage. And</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, Look, I&rsquo;m putting up a flat panel. I&rsquo;m gonna like paint the wall. We had a little</p>
<p>you had a little easel and you&rsquo;d write on chalk how much you know,</p>
<p>then Chamath like I got a new house. He&rsquo;s got his new house. We come over. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Jake, how you want some water? I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I&rsquo;d love a glass. He&rsquo;s like, Hey,</p>
<p>how you want a beverage? But yeah, it&rsquo;s like a glass of water. And he goes, Oh,</p>
<p>and he walks over to a rack. And in the rack, like, you know, those things you push wine on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a rack for water. And there is Voss in the glass bottles. There is Evian and glass</p>
<p>bottles old and you&rsquo;re not like the Evian that you get at the regular supermarket.</p>
<p>Like somebody sourced the Evian bottles that restaurants have. And then he had the smart</p>
<p>one. I mean, there&rsquo;s 60 and I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s one on a glass of water, but okay, I&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>the Evian in the glass bottle. It was delightful. Saks, I got three different bounce passes I can</p>
<p>give you just where you want it. Do you want cancel culture? Do you want Chesa Boudin? Or</p>
<p>COVID?</p>
<p>What do you want? Or COVID? I can give you any of these.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to pass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about any of those sound good to me. I mean,</p>
<p>the, it might be time for a chase update because we haven&rsquo;t done that in a while.</p>
<p>The killer DA?</p>
<p>The killer DA. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I just want to say, I found the journalist, you know, the journalist Saks,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t say her name. And she is setting up her LLC and the $60,000 we raised from the GoFundMe is</p>
<p>going to go to her to cover the DA&rsquo;s office for the next six to 12 months in a newsletter website.</p>
<p>Right. And just to be clear, because I think people kind of misinterpreted what you were</p>
<p>trying to do there with the GoFundMe, J-Cal.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is not for opposition research. This is not no, this is not digging up dirt. This is</p>
<p>reporting on on public policy on what should be public facts with respect to</p>
<p>what the DA&rsquo;s office is doing, how Chesa is performing in his job.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting, though, how the left journalists when I hired investigative journalists</p>
<p>to cover criminal justice, accused me of hiring an oppo researcher,</p>
<p>and these are investigative journalists. And I told them explicitly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hiring an investigative journalist to cover crime in San Francisco. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>oppo research here. And they insisted on saying I wanted to get into Chesa&rsquo;s personal life.</p>
<p>And I explicitly said that&rsquo;s not what this is for.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s face it, there aren&rsquo;t too many journalists anymore who are investigative who</p>
<p>are actually in the business of turning up new facts about elected officials. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>too busy pushing a narrative. They&rsquo;re engaged in agenda journalism. And actually, we saw a</p>
<p>really good example just to tie into what&rsquo;s happened, what happened over the past week,</p>
<p>is you had this story in the San Francisco Chronicle, which is basically pure propaganda</p>
<p>from you could see that the passing from Chesa to this reporter of this, this farcical claim</p>
<p>that crime is falling in San Francisco. I mean, this claim is so preposterous. This is the same</p>
<p>week, we saw viral videos of 10 robbers bursting out of Neiman Marcus, you know, with with every</p>
<p>handbag. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, plus, you had the virus Gary. Yeah, you had the viral</p>
<p>video of the the guy going into CVS. And just, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t even shoplifting was</p>
<p>sugars video of the person who broke into his house, stole his kids iPads and everything while</p>
<p>they were in the house, right? And cyan banister who had another home invasion just tweeted home</p>
<p>invasions are now not prosecutable crimes in San Francisco. Well, no, what they&rsquo;re doing is what</p>
<p>cyan reported about her case is and by the way, her case is in the public eye. Okay, so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>brazen for the DA to be doing this. But what they did is they dropped the home invasion charges.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just treating it as basically a theft of, you know, a few hundred dollars,</p>
<p>you know, that does not capture the violation of breaking into someone&rsquo;s house and how dangerous</p>
<p>that is. But originally, I thought, okay, why is the DA&rsquo;s office doing this? Originally,</p>
<p>I thought, well, maybe it&rsquo;s just because, you know, Chase doesn&rsquo;t want to incarcerate anybody,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more than that. You see, if they drop the charges, down to petty larceny,</p>
<p>then he can include it in a different stat. You see, home burglaries are up by some gargantuan</p>
<p>amount, like 50% year over year, they want to be able to claim crime is falling. And so now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re juking the stats by reducing the charges from the more serious crime to the less serious</p>
<p>crime. And then what they do is shaping the stats, they&rsquo;re juking the stats, you ever watched the</p>
<p>the show, The Wire, that&rsquo;s where this expression comes from, is, you know, first, the politicians</p>
<p>get held held accountable to the statistics, then they realize that then they start manipulating the</p>
<p>facts. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s basically so dirty. It&rsquo;s so dirty. But But the next step in the process</p>
<p>is they then feed these juke stats to these compliant reporters. I mean, the fact that</p>
<p>they keep repeating these statistics as going down, when people are stopping reporting crimes,</p>
<p>because they will prosecute them, right, and they mischaracterize them. And then they never say</p>
<p>85% of the commuters coming into San Francisco are no longer coming into San Francisco. And</p>
<p>target announced, like Walgreens, that they are either closing stores or reducing the hours</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t deal with the crime. And they&rsquo;re saying explicitly, this is the highest</p>
<p>crime we&rsquo;ve ever seen in any of our stores. And then this crazy communist, are they communists</p>
<p>on the left here? CVS, Walgreens and target are all closing stores are reducing store hours,</p>
<p>because they understand the hit to their bottom line. But you have this mantra.</p>
<p>It is it is communist like where it&rsquo;s like the commandments written on the barn in Animal Farm,</p>
<p>where it is propaganda that&rsquo;s so at odds with reality. It&rsquo;s just absurd. Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s farcical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s farcical. But then how do they enforce it? What they say is anybody who questions this</p>
<p>narrative is a bad person is in fact, a racist, a racist and a Klansman. So this is the other</p>
<p>thing that happened over the past week is that you had this is crazy. But basically,</p>
<p>Michelle Tandler, who is a moderate and as nice a person as you could ever find</p>
<p>concerned citizen concerned citizen, San Francisco born and raised,</p>
<p>yes, who tweeted that all of her friends are thinking about leaving the city. And then in</p>
<p>response to that, you had this this senior policy advisor to chase a booty and who works for the</p>
<p>DA&rsquo;s office named Kate Chatfield attacker basically implying her views were, you know,</p>
<p>were KKK values for for having the audacity to warn that people are worried about crime in San</p>
<p>Francisco. So she gets attacked. By the way, this this Chatfield person, the top of her profile is</p>
<p>the clenched fist of the communist revolution. So this is his office. But But look, it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>trolling. And it&rsquo;s not even just slander. It&rsquo;s, I think, an abuse of power for someone in the</p>
<p>DA&rsquo;s office to go after and attack a concerned citizen like this. Okay. But this is how the</p>
<p>enforce Can you read the tweet that she did? Do you have that there? Because she basically is</p>
<p>the people who have experienced home invasions are concerned for the safety of their families.</p>
<p>And what this woman did Michelle, I believe is her name. She just said, like people are scared</p>
<p>for their families. And then Kate Chatfield reference birth of a nation and compared her to</p>
<p>Oh, our wives are not safe. Because of black people. And that&rsquo;s a KKK.</p>
<p>Yeah, the original name of birth of a nation, I think was the Klansman.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s like a KKK piece of propaganda. Wow. But it&rsquo;s really outrageous.</p>
<p>She just blocked me. Kate Chatfield blocked me. Wow. This is a public policy advisor who&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>hiding her account. Well, what I mean, a public official should not do that. I mean, they should</p>
<p>and so this set you off. Let&rsquo;s be let&rsquo;s be honest. Well, I know Michelle Chandler. She</p>
<p>worked at Yammer, you know, and I didn&rsquo;t I thought it was out of bounds for not just a public official,</p>
<p>but someone in the DA&rsquo;s office. Who did you do? Well, I just went into revenge mode. Let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>honest. You got a little bit. You were a little bit tweaked. I donated another $50,000 to the</p>
<p>recall chasing campaign. And you dedicated it to Kate. Yeah, I said this is for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, because look, this is threatening. Every American should have the right to criticize</p>
<p>their government without having its law enforcement arm come down on them. And so here you have a</p>
<p>legitimate concern expressed by a private citizen and the DA&rsquo;s office is coming down on them. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not acceptable. I think I need to break some news here. I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about this publicly,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so outraged now that I think I should let this out. So while I after the week in the</p>
<p>weeks after I started that campaign, to hire an investigative journalist for chess&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>this is breaking news. I haven&rsquo;t talked about this publicly, but I&rsquo;m going to break it now.</p>
<p>Do you know who contacted me? The DA&rsquo;s office? You know what they contacted me about?</p>
<p>They were investigating a startup that I had invested in. I won&rsquo;t say which one. And they</p>
<p>wanted to interview me about my involvement with that startup because that startup had some</p>
<p>complaint from a downstream investor who felt that they were committing some type of fraud or</p>
<p>problem. coincidence. Are you serious? I&rsquo;m serious. This is literally becoming Chinatown.</p>
<p>They literally tried to intimidate me. And I didn&rsquo;t want to bring it up. And I talked to</p>
<p>the person on the phone, the person from the DA&rsquo;s office who was investigating this. And he&rsquo;s I was</p>
<p>like, Do I need an attorney for this? Why are you calling me? Because he said, Well, you know,</p>
<p>we just want to talk to you about this. And I was like, Yeah, no, we have a bunch of questions. And</p>
<p>I just said, You know what, subpoena me, I&rsquo;m not, you know, file something, and I&rsquo;ll come in with my</p>
<p>attorney to talk to you. But I&rsquo;m not going to talk with you on background. No. So they literally</p>
<p>tried to intimidate me. You know what, and I kind of let them because I didn&rsquo;t want to make it public.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m making a public now. You should make it public. Because public now. Well, because this</p>
<p>is two weeks after I said, let&rsquo;s hire the journalist. It&rsquo;s intimidation tactics. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intimidation. I will not be intimidated, Chesa. All right. But what you can see here is okay,</p>
<p>look, I mean, I was intimidated. I&rsquo;m not gonna have me intimidated again.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, like I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong here. I put 50k I put 50 or 100k</p>
<p>into a company that didn&rsquo;t work out. And now some other investors complaining, and they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>tie it back to me somehow. But Jason, you of course, you&rsquo;re gonna be intimidated. The chief</p>
<p>law enforcement officer of San Francisco is basically trying to make you the target of an</p>
<p>investigation because of what you said publicly. Of course, that is intimidation.</p>
<p>Guys, isn&rsquo;t it possible that they&rsquo;re just interviewing you about a fraud claim?</p>
<p>I gotta tell you something. A police officer drove past my house last night. Yeah.</p>
<p>Freeberg. Wait, it&rsquo;s the first and only time I&rsquo;ve ever been contacted by a law</p>
<p>enforcement officer over an investment. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just a coincidence. Stop committing fraud.</p>
<p>350 investments. Listen, Chesa has not had time. He&rsquo;s almost two years in office now. And he has</p>
<p>not had time to successfully prosecute one murder trial. Not one. But his office has time to run</p>
<p>down whatever they&rsquo;re trying to run down with Jake out. They don&rsquo;t have time to prosecute the</p>
<p>home invader who broke into cyan banisters home or Brian&rsquo;s or Brian&rsquo;s they don&rsquo;t have time to do</p>
<p>that, but they somehow have time to contact Jake out. He tweeted the video. Let me explain what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here. There&rsquo;s two things going on. I think one of which is becoming very well understood,</p>
<p>but the other one is not. The first one is the Gothamization of San Francisco. We understand that</p>
<p>crime is out of control, cynicism and resignation. People are just kind of given into it. It feels</p>
<p>like San Francisco has become Gotham City. These viral videos of the robbers brazenly committing</p>
<p>daylight theft. There is no UPS drivers in the street. There is beating a UPS driver</p>
<p>because there is no consequence. Okay. But there&rsquo;s a second thing happening,</p>
<p>which is the Orwellianization of San Francisco government and San Francisco politics.</p>
<p>You not only have the crime, you&rsquo;ve got the brazen lies about the crime. You&rsquo;ve got this insistence</p>
<p>on this animal farm commandment that crime is falling. And if you question it, you are a bad</p>
<p>class and you&rsquo;re a Klansman. And then they get there, the, you know, the cake, the cake,</p>
<p>Chad feels to push this out. And then they get academics to back this up. Okay. There are now</p>
<p>they get their friends in the media and in the academy to give these spurious claims credence.</p>
<p>And then the final step is that the rich virtue signalers pay these people off. They pay the</p>
<p>protection money. Who&rsquo;s paying off the Dustin Moskovitz is the Mike Kriegers, the Reed Hastings,</p>
<p>and, you know, even actually the biggest contributor to chaser right now is a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s under SEC indictment for the ripple scandal. Oh no. Yeah. Chris, Chris. Yes, exactly. So people</p>
<p>who need to curry favor either because they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;ve got their own problems or they just like</p>
<p>to virtue signal. Chris Larson is Chess&rsquo;s biggest Orwellian campaign. Oh, wow. That is dark. Brian</p>
<p>sugar, release the video. And that person&rsquo;s not going to be prosecuted. I mean, that is the crazy</p>
<p>part. You get somebody on camera and they won&rsquo;t prosecute them. And people forget these are</p>
<p>organized gangs that are doing this. This has been proven. This is not a poverty issue. These are not</p>
<p>poor people who are stealing bread for their families or trying to make their rent. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>organized gangs, right? Did you see 47? Did you see the getaway cars to the Neiman Marcus? Yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all like the Mercedes driving great beautiful cars with their license plates off.</p>
<p>This is like mob behavior. And if you give criminals, trust me, I grew up in a criminal</p>
<p>environment in Brooklyn. If you give criminals a window, they will figure it out. You give them an</p>
<p>opportunity. If you give them something to hack, they will hack it. Period. And you basically have</p>
<p>green lighted them. Okay, listen, it&rsquo;s enough of us complaining about this. I am going to stop</p>
<p>complaining about this. And I&rsquo;m moving either to Texas, I&rsquo;m moving to Texas or to Florida. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>making the announcement now. Hold on. Is that for sure? Jk? Listen, I you know, I&rsquo;m in a partnership</p>
<p>and my partner doesn&rsquo;t want to be here anymore. And I&rsquo;m half and half. So I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here anymore. I mean, I think California is my position right now is California is going to be</p>
<p>on a decade long slide. And I&rsquo;m working for 10 more years, I decided I&rsquo;m 50. I decided I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to go to 60. I&rsquo;m going to try to invest in 100 to 200 companies a year for 10 years, and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done. So why would I spend 10 years in a place that is on a death spiral? Can this be reversed</p>
<p>in our in the next decade? How does it feel to be completely red pilled? I&rsquo;m purple pill. I want</p>
<p>to live in a I want to live in a reasonable place. And it seems to me that Austin and Miami are</p>
<p>purple, you know, and they&rsquo;re not coming. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a right wing place. All right. And</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to live in a communist place. I want to live in an American place. I want to live in a</p>
<p>place where Americans can talk about issues without being villainized period. That&rsquo;s how I feel about</p>
<p>this pod. You&rsquo;re not being villainized. Just give me a break. All right. Just be you. People really</p>
<p>want to know if you went to dinner with Tucker, can you just make that statement that you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you just made it was a joke. Why can&rsquo;t you admit it or not? Listen, I have 15 minutes we got to go</p>
<p>COVID Delta people are panicking. But the numbers keep going straight down.</p>
<p>Pfizer says Israel says maybe Pfizer is 65% instead of 94% 65% seems pretty great. We at any</p>
<p>risk? Well, okay, let me jump into this because I&rsquo;ve been affected personally by it. So yeah, on</p>
<p>the last pod I did I get to give the stat which was that at that point that the best data we had</p>
<p>even a week ago was that the the Pfizer vaccine was holding up pretty well against the Delta</p>
<p>variant. It had reduced the effectiveness from about 95 to 88%. That&rsquo;s sort of the numbers.</p>
<p>I think on Monday, Israel released a new study showing that the effectiveness of</p>
<p>Pfizer against Delta had been reduced to 64%. Now, that&rsquo;s against, you know, getting symptoms</p>
<p>and testing positive. It was still 93% against serious cases requiring hospitalization. But that</p>
<p>93% is down from, you know, 99% plus. So there has been reduced effectiveness by Delta. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it is a little bit concerning. And as if to underscore this point, someone very close to me,</p>
<p>who was double vaxxed with Pfizer just tested positive. He did test positive. Yes.</p>
<p>So he woke up yesterday morning with, with cold symptoms. He had sore throat, runny nose,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s fine. And a slight fever, which then graduated into a headache. He went and got tested.</p>
<p>And he tested positive for COVID. So I think he&rsquo;s fine city was he and when this happened,</p>
<p>la. Okay, let me ask a question to freeberg. Is it not the best possible situation? I know this</p>
<p>sounds like a stupid question, but I am the lowest IQ guy on the pod. Is it not the best situation to</p>
<p>have the Pfizer or whatever have this amazing, then to get a mild case of COVID and then be</p>
<p>doubly protected? Is that in some way an ideal situation if there is no long haul COVID?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really clear if that&rsquo;s going to make a difference. You know, again, like remember,</p>
<p>acquired immunity is on a spectrum, right? So a virus can get in your nose starts replicating.</p>
<p>And if you got a ton of antibodies that immediately get to your nose, it&rsquo;ll shut</p>
<p>down that virus before you experience anything. If that virus gets in your nose and starts</p>
<p>replicating, and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ve got a kind of, you know, your antibodies to that specific virus,</p>
<p>you know, aren&rsquo;t as concentrated, it&rsquo;s going to take your body a little bit longer to fight off</p>
<p>that virus. But you&rsquo;re still well ahead of the game as a way to think about it. And so, you know,</p>
<p>to some extent, what we&rsquo;re seeing most likely is this delta variant, having a greater escape</p>
<p>velocity from people that have been vaccinated, then you know, the alpha variant or any of the</p>
<p>other variants we&rsquo;ve seen. And so as a result, you know, people are getting to date, luckily,</p>
<p>knock on wood, mostly mild and moderate symptoms, and only a minority of people that are exposed</p>
<p>are getting, you know, that condition, but it&rsquo;s being tracked really closely. I mean, like,</p>
<p>like Zack said, in Israel, they have now said that, you know, if you&rsquo;re vaccinated with Pfizer,</p>
<p>double vax with Pfizer, you&rsquo;re now 64%, you know, effective. And you&rsquo;re, you know, that that means</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re exposed to COVID, there&rsquo;s a chance you can actually get these symptoms. But the</p>
<p>hospitalization rate, and the fatality rate is still way, way low, because you have built up</p>
<p>enough immunity, you&rsquo;ve built up enough antibodies to have a good, strong defense to keep things from</p>
<p>getting out of control. And so knock on wood right now, we&rsquo;re still looking good in terms of fatality</p>
<p>and hospitalizations. But there&rsquo;s certainly a mouth, you know, what do you think of this situation?</p>
<p>Are markets kind of worrying about this? Because I&rsquo;m kind of wondering, like, as, as, as market</p>
<p>participants see this stuff, are they trading it in a way that&rsquo;s like fearful? And does this lead</p>
<p>to some market conditions in the next couple days and weeks? I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>good chance that some politicians are going to try to use this for another shutdown in the fall.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. And I think the teachers unions, the NEA and the AFT are already</p>
<p>putting all sorts of demands on going back to school. I don&rsquo;t think this date so first of all,</p>
<p>I think we have to be intellectually honest that this is a bad data point.</p>
<p>This is really the first bad data point that we&rsquo;ve gotten until now all the data has been good.</p>
<p>The protection from the vaccines lasts longer, it had been completely holding up against the</p>
<p>variants. But this data point from Israel is not a great data point. I want to see more of them.</p>
<p>More data. But I don&rsquo;t think that this by itself didn&rsquo;t Israel only get to like 5560%</p>
<p>vaccinated. Oh, no, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re way higher than they&rsquo;re way higher than that. Yeah,</p>
<p>half of the infections they&rsquo;re seeing in Israel are children that were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>And then the other half are the other half are adults. And so if you look at the adult</p>
<p>infection rate, it looks like it&rsquo;s something around 15% of, you know, these cases, I forgot</p>
<p>the number, but there&rsquo;s some statistic that shows that it&rsquo;s not the majority being vaccinated,</p>
<p>there are unvaccinated people that are, look, we&rsquo;re gonna probably, we&rsquo;re gonna probably need</p>
<p>a booster, and we&rsquo;re probably going to be on a cocktail. But beyond that, I think we need to</p>
<p>make a moral decision that we are all getting back to life as normal. Yeah, 100%. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>there. There will be boosters for sure. Right? Like this fall? Yeah, exactly. And I think</p>
<p>the question about this, this data is does it warrant a change in policy? And I would say not</p>
<p>yet. You know, 100% not yet. I mean, we the whole policy idea was ICUs being filled. And if you look</p>
<p>at the stats in the United States, at the deaths, we are now at a seven day average of under 200.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 150 deaths per day. Some is again, I&rsquo;ll ask you freebrew, how many of those are with</p>
<p>COVID versus from COVID? Yeah, it&rsquo;s unclear. But like Israel hasn&rsquo;t had a single death in two</p>
<p>weeks from COVID. Right? So what are we talking about here? Despite this increase in numbers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a right, right. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not what the media likes to portray,</p>
<p>which is variants punching through, right? I mean, it&rsquo;s not like Delta variant is just</p>
<p>sweeping through Israel. Okay, there is a slight increase in cases. And we&rsquo;re definitely seeing</p>
<p>elevated cases here in the US. I mean, Delta variants can become the main the dominant</p>
<p>strain if it isn&rsquo;t already. Look, it&rsquo;s mostly sweeping through areas that have not been</p>
<p>vaccinated. But there are now cases, I&rsquo;d say mostly mild cases of people who have been</p>
<p>vaccinated. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s all the more reason why if you&rsquo;re an adult, you should get</p>
<p>vaccinated. We really do need all adults barring some sort of, you know, highly specific immune</p>
<p>condition that were you need to be on some sort of different treatment. But almost all adults in</p>
<p>the US really should get vaccinated. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re going to have keep having these variants</p>
<p>sweep through. I&rsquo;ll tell you, I had a really good conversation with an infectious disease</p>
<p>doctor yesterday, who&rsquo;s a research specialist and well known in this space. And he pointed out that</p>
<p>the evolutionary cycle of this virus is a function of how many people are not vaccinated.</p>
<p>Because the more bodies the virus has to hop, the faster the more evolution it can do,</p>
<p>the more it evolves, right? Yes. And so, you know, certain virologists and epidemiologists</p>
<p>will model this where they will highlight kind of the evolutionary rate of the virus as a function</p>
<p>of unvaccinated people getting infected every day. And so the more people that we get vaccinated,</p>
<p>the longer the timeline it takes for the virus to evolve and get to a breakthrough variant.</p>
<p>And so we need to accelerate and continue to push people to get vaccinated worldwide</p>
<p>to reduce the available pool for evolutionary success of the virus.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s to put it in maybe layman&rsquo;s terms, all these unvaccinated people are basically like a</p>
<p>giant Petri dish for the virus to keep mutating. And we do need, I think, like a Marshall Plan</p>
<p>to help all these other countries get vaccinated. I mean, I think we have enough vaccines in the US,</p>
<p>but what have we done to help all these other countries? It directly benefits us</p>
<p>if we reduce the size of that Petri dish. This Delta variant came from India. Why?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a billion plus people there who, you know, for the virus to mutate on. I mean,</p>
<p>obviously, with a Petri dish that big, you&rsquo;re going to get a variant. Now there&rsquo;s a new variant</p>
<p>coming out of Peru, which looks potentially scary. Now, these are not full breakthrough</p>
<p>variants yet. But to Friberg&rsquo;s point, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>You guys want to guess the bottom two states in the country? I mean, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>Mississippi and Alabama, Alabama. Exactly. Can you imagine Mississippi and Alabama,</p>
<p>33%? Come on, get your act together. It&rsquo;s going to whip through those places and you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>going to die. You&rsquo;re going to kill your grandparents. Is that an evangelical movement</p>
<p>issue? It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, well, we talked about this the last pod. There&rsquo;s two groups in America</p>
<p>who are most Republican men. Oh, no, let&rsquo;s be more specific. It&rsquo;s evangelicals and African</p>
<p>Americans. Those are the two groups who are most you keep saying evangel, you keep saying</p>
<p>evangel, what is it? How do you pronounce it? Evangelical evangelicals. It&rsquo;s actually male</p>
<p>Republicans. Why can&rsquo;t you? No, that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re not being specific enough. Yeah, guys. I gotta,</p>
<p>I gotta, I gotta run. Love you. Freeberg. Love you guys. We love you. See you later.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>This is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at Queens.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like sexual tension, but they just need to release it somehow.</p>
<p>Let your beat be. Let your beat be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
