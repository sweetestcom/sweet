<p>about synthetic cannabis that&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of interesting shit you know</p>
<p>about that man</p>
<p>they have that</p>
<p>no no no it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>synthetic cannabis it&rsquo;s like you know how they had that</p>
<p>uh when the</p>
<p>whole balco scandal came out what</p>
<p>it was was a steroid that they had made that was just</p>
<p>slightly different</p>
<p>from regular steroids</p>
<p>and was undetectable in tests because the regular</p>
<p>steroids are</p>
<p>what they were looking for in the test they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t looking for this stuff</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with this there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>synthetic cannabis that you could</p>
<p>smoke it as the same</p>
<p>effects and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t show up in tests</p>
<p>what does it look like it looks like weed</p>
<p>it actually looks like we</p>
<p>yeah looks like so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>plant yeah yeah</p>
<p>and they just wow</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>grown it and i mean it makes</p>
<p>sense i mean they&rsquo;ve figured out a way to</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know about this</p>
<p>botanists have figured out a way a long time ago to</p>
<p>put thc into</p>
<p>other things they</p>
<p>like there was an</p>
<p>article online</p>
<p>where there</p>
<p>was this guy was trying to put thc in tomatoes</p>
<p>get tomatoes to grow tac</p>
<p>like they can fuck with plants</p>
<p>and have them you know you know different</p>
<p>plants produce more vitamin c</p>
<p>and different</p>
<p>plants do certain things and</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to make</p>
<p>these i guess they have figured out how to whit them</p>
<p>away how to make weed</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t show up in drug tests</p>
<p>pretty crazy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>so if you work for ups or something like that and they</p>
<p>drug test you you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke weed you can</p>
<p>smoke the fuck out of this</p>
<p>stuff how long has this been out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been out for a while man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make it illegal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big deal now they&rsquo;re trying to make it illegal</p>
<p>oh shit dirty bitches</p>
<p>so you could sell it anywhere</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>stuff that they&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>on in high times magazines</p>
<p>where they know</p>
<p>that bullshit that</p>
<p>stuff&rsquo;s not real at all</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s up with that shit</p>
<p>is whack that is the weakest shit ever that fake weed</p>
<p>that they sell</p>
<p>that is so dumb</p>
<p>but they say that that&rsquo;s like a big part of</p>
<p>their advertising revenue</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s just because they&rsquo;re fucking lazy</p>
<p>you know you telling me that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so afraid of weed they can&rsquo;t advertise</p>
<p>their products in your</p>
<p>magazine come on</p>
<p>but yet you can sell fake weed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just ripping people off that&rsquo;s all that is that</p>
<p>stuff doesn&rsquo;t get anyone high</p>
<p>but this other</p>
<p>stuff does this other</p>
<p>stuff is real shit</p>
<p>where do you get it</p>
<p>eddie is here talk about ufos already</p>
<p>michael shivelo the guy from</p>
<p>k1 and you know</p>
<p>dream you know the</p>
<p>australian dude</p>
<p>that we hung out with in australia yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big ufo guy and he was down at the roswell museum</p>
<p>and he actually saw ufo and took fucking</p>
<p>photos of it and shit</p>
<p>fuck yeah that&rsquo;s pretty crazy yeah</p>
<p>it means who the fuck knows man</p>
<p>do you have any ufo questions</p>
<p>go ahead and shoot</p>
<p>did i finish the entire</p>
<p>plate of food you post on twitter i finished most of it</p>
<p>i fuck up some food folks</p>
<p>especially after shows</p>
<p>after shows i could fuck up some food</p>
<p>you know as the ufc too</p>
<p>you burn off a lot of energy just talking</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like you would</p>
<p>but you do like a red man did he actually say something</p>
<p>for lapo saturday</p>
<p>this is red red bands what does that mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>did i watch that</p>
<p>train wreck prison wives on the discovery channel</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s a show about</p>
<p>chicks whose husbands are in prison</p>
<p>oh i might have to teevo that yeah</p>
<p>what channel help teevo that discovery channel</p>
<p>might be good</p>
<p>oh the history channel documentary i know what i saw</p>
<p>yeah i saw that one too that was kind of interesting</p>
<p>that was the best documentary i&rsquo;ve ever seen on ufos</p>
<p>definitely i know what i saw i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>it was one of</p>
<p>those rare documentaries that</p>
<p>about ufos that didn&rsquo;t have like that</p>
<p>the other side</p>
<p>you know they didn&rsquo;t have a guy</p>
<p>going well you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all just mythology and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>their minds and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>crazy and why are they landing</p>
<p>in idaho all the time why not in big cities</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any of</p>
<p>those guys cause it was so ridiculous</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>high ranking military officers coming forward</p>
<p>you know that one case in england on a us base</p>
<p>where that eighty witnesses</p>
<p>and three of the guys went up to it and touched it</p>
<p>and wrote down notes on it</p>
<p>and they all came up and the ministry of defense</p>
<p>totally they said</p>
<p>this is not</p>
<p>a concern of national defense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their comment</p>
<p>so that is that</p>
<p>alone right there is pretty crazy</p>
<p>and those arizona</p>
<p>those arizona</p>
<p>lights i mean people saying there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how many witnesses but</p>
<p>the arizona</p>
<p>lights pretty</p>
<p>crazy i know a dude who</p>
<p>lived in arizona saw that</p>
<p>he said he saw the fucking the big pyramid</p>
<p>thing flying through the air</p>
<p>and they saying it&rsquo;s like bigger than</p>
<p>aircraft carriers</p>
<p>football field</p>
<p>yeah he said it was gigantic</p>
<p>he said it was a gigantic big pyramid shaped</p>
<p>thing flying through the sky</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>you know my take on ufos is</p>
<p>if they really were</p>
<p>aliens that</p>
<p>could come here from another planet</p>
<p>do you think that they</p>
<p>would be so</p>
<p>silly that they would</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t disguise themselves</p>
<p>i think a lot of the shit we see all the time</p>
<p>could be ufos</p>
<p>i told you about that crazy dude</p>
<p>that told me that</p>
<p>you show me</p>
<p>pictures of clouds</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a dude that i know is a comedian is a very nice guy</p>
<p>and the other day</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking to him at the improv</p>
<p>and homeboy says what do you think</p>
<p>about ufos and i said well you know hey man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen one but i don&rsquo;t discount</p>
<p>the idea it made certainly possible obviously we have</p>
<p>spaceships and</p>
<p>for someone from</p>
<p>other planets if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more intelligent than us for sure they</p>
<p>could have spaceships</p>
<p>so he starts pulling on his iphone and the dude</p>
<p>has like dozens of</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>clouds on his phone</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like what was that what do you</p>
<p>think about this look at this</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>and i go it&rsquo;s cloud and</p>
<p>he goes yeah but it&rsquo;s an unusually shaped</p>
<p>cloud look at it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh no he&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy this dude</p>
<p>takes pictures of</p>
<p>clouds all different</p>
<p>clouds and he&rsquo;s convinced that these</p>
<p>clouds are ufos</p>
<p>yeah but on one</p>
<p>point on one hand you got to think like</p>
<p>if you really are so</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>visit from other planets</p>
<p>why would you you know</p>
<p>for sure we&rsquo;re working on cloaking</p>
<p>devices right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>this japanese jacket that&rsquo;s been invented that</p>
<p>basically takes an</p>
<p>image of what&rsquo;s behind you and broadcasts it on the</p>
<p>front of the jacket it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically like predator type shit you remember from the</p>
<p>movie the predator yeah and</p>
<p>they really have this already i mean it&rsquo;s not perfected</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t travel to</p>
<p>other planets yet either you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so if someone</p>
<p>from another planet is so much more highly intelligent</p>
<p>than we are that they can actually</p>
<p>travel here from</p>
<p>other galaxies or</p>
<p>other solar</p>
<p>systems for sure</p>
<p>they figured</p>
<p>something like this out</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re seeing the sky</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very possible you know that what you&rsquo;re seeing is</p>
<p>if there are ufos you</p>
<p>would see an</p>
<p>image of the</p>
<p>sky behind the ufo being projected on the ufo</p>
<p>so you wouldn&rsquo;t see shit</p>
<p>you know that said you if you</p>
<p>could take into account how many ufos are reported</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>ridiculous amount of ufos reported</p>
<p>and if you take into account how many</p>
<p>people see and don&rsquo;t report they don&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>cause they wanna look foolish</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn</p>
<p>ufos i think a lot of what people are saying</p>
<p>military jets that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand like when i was in</p>
<p>we did fear factor down near edwards air force base</p>
<p>and they had stealth bombers that flew up and dude</p>
<p>you see a stealth bomber you think that&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>spaceship yeah the french government did a test</p>
<p>it was a serious</p>
<p>review of all</p>
<p>the there&rsquo;s like 50 000 or something like something</p>
<p>50 000 since a certain year there&rsquo;s probably way more</p>
<p>but they they came to the conclusion that</p>
<p>ninety five percent</p>
<p>of the reported cases can be explained</p>
<p>away without like military all this high ranking</p>
<p>military this top</p>
<p>secret military planes and</p>
<p>different lights</p>
<p>but they said five percent</p>
<p>most likely</p>
<p>are aircraft from</p>
<p>other worlds</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why they can say aircraft from</p>
<p>other worlds because i don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>think we have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more likely perfect inventory of what</p>
<p>exists in this know what they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s probably what that is more likely</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some extraterrestrial craft</p>
<p>than i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 5 of it just</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not from</p>
<p>our government or the russian government</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean even it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>another planet we don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is in the</p>
<p>ocean well you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>a lot of ufos get</p>
<p>sighted yeah</p>
<p>called you coming out of the</p>
<p>yeah there was a whole</p>
<p>history channel documentary</p>
<p>about that and people go well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous that&rsquo;s nonsense that&rsquo;s silly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s silly that you can send a fucking picture</p>
<p>that you could</p>
<p>take this fucking</p>
<p>thing and send</p>
<p>a video across the sky into somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone in australia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way more silly</p>
<p>than some people from another planet have</p>
<p>visited here or</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something living in the ocean</p>
<p>especially when you have guys</p>
<p>like x pentagon</p>
<p>high ranking officials</p>
<p>like philip corso</p>
<p>who before he died he</p>
<p>wrote a book and he explained his job in the government</p>
<p>and the pentagon</p>
<p>was taking crash ufo</p>
<p>stuff taking it to</p>
<p>hughes aircraft and lockheed and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>aerospace companies</p>
<p>to reverse engineering he&rsquo;s saying he was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many interviews on youtube with philip corsel</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dead now he was on dateline and they try to like</p>
<p>ridicule but</p>
<p>you know how do you</p>
<p>j alan hynek</p>
<p>is another excellent example that j</p>
<p>alan hynek was</p>
<p>the guy who was in charge of project blue book</p>
<p>and he was told</p>
<p>to buy the government when they had this</p>
<p>thing to explain away</p>
<p>everything swamp gas</p>
<p>you know mass</p>
<p>hysteria anything they</p>
<p>could do to explain away</p>
<p>ufo cases but as he became more involved</p>
<p>in project blue</p>
<p>book and as he investigated more and more</p>
<p>sightings and you</p>
<p>know and dealt with more and more evidence he became</p>
<p>absolutely convinced</p>
<p>that ufos were real</p>
<p>so jay allen hynek who</p>
<p>is you know</p>
<p>like a guy actually working</p>
<p>to discredit</p>
<p>ufos eventually</p>
<p>came out and started</p>
<p>supporting the</p>
<p>whole ufo movement so</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>ridiculous to</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;ve been visited</p>
<p>i mean we go to the congo</p>
<p>all the time and stare at chimpanzees</p>
<p>i mean if you</p>
<p>were from another planet and you had the ability to</p>
<p>travel here</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>check out people people are fucking</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably fascinating</p>
<p>i mean what</p>
<p>would be more we</p>
<p>study lower forms of animals we always have and</p>
<p>we have been doing this</p>
<p>since the beginning of time i mean people</p>
<p>people have always been interested in botany</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve always been interested in</p>
<p>studying different</p>
<p>monkeys and different</p>
<p>weird animals and other</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole thing with darwin it</p>
<p>took an account of all</p>
<p>these different animals that he came across</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always done shit like that</p>
<p>and i think if we were</p>
<p>much higher intelligent</p>
<p>than human beings</p>
<p>we would want to do that with people we</p>
<p>would want to</p>
<p>check out and see what the fuck people are up to</p>
<p>see if people are evolving see what the bottleneck is</p>
<p>as far as like social and cultural</p>
<p>evolution and</p>
<p>see what the bottleneck is as far as technological</p>
<p>evolution and whether or not</p>
<p>our technology is</p>
<p>surpassing our our ability</p>
<p>as a human being</p>
<p>like to to make rational decisions and i</p>
<p>think it probably is right now</p>
<p>you know they just</p>
<p>fired up the</p>
<p>large hadron collider yesterday you know</p>
<p>yesterday was like the first test</p>
<p>nos pohatu is watching</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>i think that looks like a lot</p>
<p>i think that looks like i&rsquo;ll do to reno i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it looks like oh</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know poha is</p>
<p>a portuguese</p>
<p>this brazilian guys say poha all the time it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it sort of means like fuck or balls it means like a</p>
<p>bunch of different things they say it all the time</p>
<p>balls means balls i think it means jizz oh</p>
<p>jizz yeah yeah not balls i</p>
<p>heard a bunch of different translations but to me</p>
<p>nos pohatu is the fighting vampire you know what i mean</p>
<p>draku linho</p>
<p>draculino is a famous baja gracie black belt</p>
<p>and draculine</p>
<p>i guess he looks like dracula or something</p>
<p>so i call him nos pohatu he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>brazilian vampire that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>am i not gonna commentate yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna commentate</p>
<p>this shit&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna leave in half an hour</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re chilling here in the</p>
<p>hotel room getting</p>
<p>ready to go</p>
<p>down there and commentate yeah my commentary</p>
<p>what do i think</p>
<p>about scientology i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome if you&rsquo;re gay and you want to</p>
<p>cover it up they&rsquo;re real good at that shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nonsense</p>
<p>all religions</p>
<p>are nonsense you don&rsquo;t you know just as much as i know</p>
<p>as far as like what happens when you die no one knows</p>
<p>i think you know what i</p>
<p>think religion</p>
<p>is awesome if</p>
<p>you do it right if you do it</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like you do the</p>
<p>right thing and help your neighbors</p>
<p>like my grandma was hardcore catholic</p>
<p>and i wouldn&rsquo;t try to convince</p>
<p>her like if she was</p>
<p>still alive to get out of that she was doing</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to church</p>
<p>every day praying</p>
<p>and that praying</p>
<p>is like meditating she was</p>
<p>meditating so</p>
<p>i think just like</p>
<p>like having a healthy</p>
<p>heart you could</p>
<p>some people can do kettlebell some people</p>
<p>could run on a treadmill some people run</p>
<p>stairs some people do martial arts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for a healthy</p>
<p>heart it all works</p>
<p>and i think religion whether you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>jesus or the allah</p>
<p>or the buddha</p>
<p>or meditation or yoga</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter as long as you get</p>
<p>your frequency at the</p>
<p>right spot with the universe</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you do the</p>
<p>jesus thing</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>i think that i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right yeah i</p>
<p>think whatever gets you in that</p>
<p>right frequency</p>
<p>you could worship your iphone</p>
<p>you actually believe that and you can</p>
<p>meditate to your iphone</p>
<p>i think the universe don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like how are you</p>
<p>gonna get to our</p>
<p>frequency that</p>
<p>all that matter</p>
<p>the real problem is people the real problem is the same</p>
<p>you know what it is it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing when whenever when someone</p>
<p>believes in something even if they believe in something</p>
<p>completely irrational</p>
<p>they want everyone else to believe in it too people</p>
<p>love everyone else to be on</p>
<p>their team that&rsquo;s why like it</p>
<p>you ever talk to people that use windows</p>
<p>and they find out they use mac</p>
<p>and they like what the fuck man use mac max for faggots</p>
<p>and they get</p>
<p>crazy like they want you to use windows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people want you to be</p>
<p>muslim they want you to be a</p>
<p>psychologist</p>
<p>they want you to be a catholic</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the real problem is that people</p>
<p>want you to to to</p>
<p>subscribe to</p>
<p>their ideology</p>
<p>but the idea</p>
<p>behind it you know being a better person and you know</p>
<p>and treating everybody as if they&rsquo;re yourself</p>
<p>and you know that all that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the way to go</p>
<p>i mean it really is</p>
<p>but the fucking handing out the</p>
<p>basket and fucking kids and all that</p>
<p>other shit that you know</p>
<p>fucking kids i have to admit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m against that</p>
<p>i saw that deliver us from evil that</p>
<p>he recommended</p>
<p>come on he recommended this documentary and you guys</p>
<p>should check</p>

<p>thing yeah well i couldn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>thing i watched</p>

<p>where it turns</p>
<p>out that guy&rsquo;s done like hundreds of kids yeah</p>
<p>yeah i couldn&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>i wanted to kill him</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s really a really sick sick</p>

<p>molesting hundreds of kids</p>
<p>and you know they</p>
<p>covered it up they kept moving them they</p>
<p>moved them all over the country</p>
<p>and really it&rsquo;s incredible and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>right now that gigantic</p>
<p>scandal that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>right now with the pope</p>
<p>i mean the pope</p>
<p>had knowledge of all this fucking shit that was</p>
<p>going on there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many pedophiles i bet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all pedophiles</p>
<p>bet they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>pedophiles because it was just all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because it was if it was just</p>
<p>if it was half of them</p>
<p>or a quarter of them</p>
<p>they would be busting each</p>
<p>other out they</p>
<p>would there</p>
<p>would be people coming forward</p>
<p>saying we gotta stop the shit they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>covering each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s asses</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about it there</p>
<p>they chose a job</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t get any pussy</p>
<p>well the whole</p>
<p>idea you know what i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta</p>
<p>drive you insane and anybody</p>
<p>who accepts a job</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t get laid</p>
<p>you gotta be fucked up already</p>
<p>you already got</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>my theory is that</p>
<p>when these guys grow up gay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>grown up in a religious home</p>
<p>then and then once</p>
<p>they find out they&rsquo;re gay they realize oh shit maybe</p>
<p>satan is inside of me</p>
<p>i got this gay feelings oh my god</p>
<p>i gotta fight</p>
<p>satan so they become</p>
<p>ultra religious</p>
<p>ultra catholic</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>prove to god that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fight the gay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>devote their life to god they become a priest</p>
<p>and then bam</p>
<p>they hold it together for the first</p>
<p>and then they lose</p>
<p>have you ever seen that</p>

<p>you can find it on joewrogan net</p>
<p>season three of tim and eric</p>
<p>because they keep having recurring</p>
<p>sketches and they just get funnier and funnier the more</p>
<p>the more developed</p>
<p>that here&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>for you what does damian maya and his jiu jitsu</p>
<p>bring to the</p>
<p>table that latest didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>versus silva</p>
<p>cause damian maya is</p>
<p>fighting anderson</p>
<p>silva next month in abu</p>
<p>dhabi next week dude</p>
<p>i think abu dhabi</p>
<p>next week i</p>
<p>think damian maya is a better</p>
<p>guard puller than</p>
<p>tyler&rsquo;s latest</p>
<p>thomas would pull</p>
<p>guard but he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t clinch up first so</p>
<p>you know silva</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t is not</p>
<p>gonna just fall in</p>
<p>you got to really</p>
<p>shoot deep with an underhook</p>
<p>and you got to make the guy sprawl</p>
<p>and if he doesn&rsquo;t sprawl</p>
<p>you know because you didn&rsquo;t take a deep shot</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna pull him into your</p>
<p>guard and damon maya likes to</p>
<p>shoot deep and pull guard i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;ll be the difference there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna stand with</p>
<p>anderson silva</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>based on not just</p>
<p>based on anderson</p>
<p>silva&rsquo;s career and what he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>but based on his last fight</p>
<p>where he tried to</p>
<p>stand for a little bit with</p>
<p>nate markor</p>
<p>and he he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pull guard immediately</p>
<p>trust me he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna fuck around any more with that shit</p>
<p>i hope that&rsquo;s true but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>stand with nate either</p>
<p>well he stood with them for one punch</p>
<p>and that was just one</p>
<p>punch too long and he&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think that him he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>training with vanderley and vanderley</p>
<p>is you know a</p>
<p>known brawler</p>
<p>you know do you think that</p>
<p>that style of</p>
<p>getting in there and just mixing it up and getting ugly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good</p>
<p>style for a</p>
<p>guy who&rsquo;s not very technically proficient striking</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just so good on the ground why</p>
<p>give your opponent</p>
<p>any kind of chance</p>
<p>standing especially anderson</p>
<p>silva were you</p>
<p>gonna try to mix it</p>
<p>up a little bit with him that&rsquo;s a big fucking mistake</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna pull</p>
<p>guard immediately trust me</p>
<p>or try to take him down cause</p>
<p>you know anderson</p>
<p>silva isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>some ncaa national</p>
<p>champion or anything so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure damon demai is really</p>
<p>gonna take a shot for real and</p>
<p>for real try to take him down but</p>
<p>if he has any trouble</p>
<p>he will pull guard</p>
<p>no problem i guarantee that</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve definitely seen anderson been</p>
<p>taken down before</p>
<p>you know it got</p>
<p>taken down many times by</p>
<p>travis looter</p>
<p>no travis looter probably had the most</p>
<p>success but you</p>
<p>gotta think</p>
<p>about that fight</p>
<p>travis luder</p>
<p>fought anderson</p>
<p>11 weeks after anderson had knee surgery on both knees</p>
<p>so that probably wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the best representation of</p>
<p>his wrestling</p>
<p>then dan henderson took him down as well</p>
<p>and when dan</p>
<p>henderson took him down he wasn&rsquo;t able to do anything</p>
<p>to him he just kind of like held him down on the ground</p>
<p>punched him</p>
<p>a few times but really couldn&rsquo;t get anything</p>
<p>going you know</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the big question is</p>
<p>is anderson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jiu jitsu good enough to stifle</p>
<p>damian maya because damian</p>
<p>maya had a hard time with dan miller in his last fight</p>
<p>really couldn&rsquo;t get anything</p>
<p>going with them i mean he ground a</p>
<p>pound of them and</p>
<p>you know he beat him by decision but</p>
<p>never came close to finishing with a</p>
<p>submission no</p>
<p>and i think dan miller</p>
<p>is a real good real</p>
<p>tough guy but i</p>
<p>think anderson&rsquo;s jujitsu is at</p>
<p>least as good as miller&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean on paper at</p>
<p>least he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black belt and miller&rsquo;s a bramble</p>
<p>but miller has</p>
<p>wrestled his</p>
<p>whole life there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big difference that&rsquo;s a different kind of animal</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re grappling with</p>
<p>a real legit</p>
<p>wrestler and</p>
<p>anderson silva</p>
<p>has long limbs</p>
<p>i like going with guys that have long arms it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>rubber guards</p>
<p>a lot easier</p>
<p>with taller guys</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder for them to pull</p>
<p>out of anything they have long arms</p>
<p>like the small</p>
<p>145 short five foot five</p>
<p>stocky wrestler types</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get any rubber</p>
<p>guard on because they pop their arms</p>
<p>out so easily they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>small so i think</p>
<p>i think dave and maya is</p>
<p>going to have more success</p>
<p>with his jujutsu</p>
<p>with anderson</p>
<p>silva if he gets him to the ground</p>
<p>then he did with miller because miller again</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s only a</p>
<p>brown belt but damn he</p>
<p>wrestled his</p>
<p>whole life that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different kind of</p>
<p>animal right there he&rsquo;s a chimpanzee</p>
<p>the other thing</p>
<p>about anderson</p>
<p>is that anderson has had</p>
<p>elbow problems for years</p>
<p>he had bone</p>
<p>chunks floating around his</p>
<p>elbow that made</p>
<p>training really difficult</p>
<p>he would have to</p>
<p>ice his elbows</p>
<p>after training</p>
<p>sometimes he couldn&rsquo;t do any weight lifting</p>
<p>any strength conditioning because his</p>
<p>elbows hurt</p>
<p>he finally got all that shit fixed</p>
<p>he got the elbow</p>
<p>chunks the the</p>
<p>pieces of bone</p>
<p>taken out so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see an anderson</p>
<p>silva that&rsquo;s in a better</p>
<p>condition than we&rsquo;ve seen him in a long long time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had a problem</p>
<p>throwing his</p>
<p>right hand because of it</p>
<p>which is really hard to believe</p>
<p>when you see his fights</p>
<p>big country nelson</p>
<p>went tonight by fat mission</p>
<p>how dare you</p>
<p>let me tell you something man fat</p>
<p>a big guy like roy nelson</p>
<p>he that weight centralized in his stomach</p>
<p>he knows how to hold you with that shit</p>
<p>that that can</p>
<p>keep you in a certain position he&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>at keeping his weight on you</p>
<p>we have a dude that we</p>
<p>train with brent</p>
<p>brandt gets you in side control man that</p>
<p>motherfucker is really hard to get off you and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built similar to big country not as fat</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got a big gut</p>
<p>and you know and he&rsquo;s talented as well he&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>jiu jitsu guy</p>
<p>and when he gets on</p>
<p>top of you and you know he gets a good position on you</p>
<p>is really hard to</p>
<p>shake him off you you</p>
<p>plants that weight down on you</p>
<p>and holds you in place and</p>
<p>big country if i had to</p>
<p>guess what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen tonight with strew</p>
<p>you know i would say that</p>
<p>big country if you get some down the ground strew&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be in a lot of trouble</p>
<p>yeah yeah but struve has</p>
<p>a lot of potential he might be a</p>
<p>he might be the</p>
<p>underdog in this</p>
<p>fight he probably</p>
<p>should be based on his</p>
<p>experience and he&rsquo;s really young and</p>
<p>and country&rsquo;s been grappling</p>
<p>for a long time he&rsquo;s really good on the ground people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really seen that he likes to</p>
<p>stand and beg but</p>
<p>country nelson&rsquo;s really good on the ground he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>i mean he meets</p>
<p>frank mir was it like 11</p>
<p>to nothing in a</p>
<p>submission match yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a great half</p>
<p>guard game too</p>
<p>we just haven&rsquo;t really seen it</p>
<p>but struve in the long run</p>
<p>has so much potential</p>
<p>i mean that guy that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 26</p>
<p>8 or something like that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s super tall</p>
<p>and he loves</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you</p>
<p>never see that you</p>
<p>never see tall guys like that</p>
<p>who are athletic and coordinated love</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i mean you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>sammy shield</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like jiu jitsu</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>other tall guy but</p>
<p>you know ran</p>
<p>a kendall grove</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another tall guy who likes</p>
<p>jiu jitsu but he</p>
<p>it was true if he</p>
<p>continues to evolve</p>
<p>and remains a student of the game</p>
<p>and everything of course</p>
<p>striking and</p>
<p>wrestling as well but</p>
<p>in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s moving and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked several times about</p>
<p>jujutsu and strategy and philosophies and stuff</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>right track he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know if he can beat country at this</p>
<p>point in his career</p>
<p>maybe maybe not</p>
<p>but get that guy another five six</p>
<p>seven years</p>
<p>if he continues to evolve</p>
<p>he can be a serious threat with that</p>
<p>with that height his guard</p>
<p>could be insane</p>
<p>yeah no kidding oh</p>
<p>he decided to be a</p>
<p>ninja off his back</p>
<p>fuck he&rsquo;s only 22</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>about that kid he&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>young he&rsquo;s got a massive massive amount of time</p>
<p>ahead of him</p>
<p>you know and a lot of potential and he&rsquo;s got crazy hard</p>
<p>remember in germany when he got cut wide open</p>
<p>was bleeding all over the</p>
<p>place and who did he</p>
<p>fight in that</p>
<p>fight fuck i remember</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>he got in trouble and got cut real bad and he</p>
<p>still pulled it out and</p>
<p>wound up submitting the dude so it was</p>
<p>pretty badass</p>
<p>do another you</p>
<p>stream tonight</p>
<p>maybe maybe we will if we get back to the</p>
<p>hotel it&rsquo;ll be late here and i don&rsquo;t go to bed</p>
<p>until late on the west</p>
<p>coast so it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>early for me</p>
<p>so yeah we could do that we could</p>
<p>come after the</p>
<p>after party</p>
<p>and do it uh</p>
<p>do it non sober</p>
<p>this is a sober version of the you</p>
<p>stream because i</p>
<p>gotta go do the broadcasting</p>
<p>right now go me or can flow</p>
<p>who the fuck knows son</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>gotta do it</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting having go me over here</p>
<p>i would have liked to see him over here years ago but</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still young</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a lot to prove</p>
<p>you know and i think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s training real hard he looked really in real good</p>
<p>shape and he&rsquo;s saying all the right</p>
<p>things that he wants to really make another run</p>
<p>and get another run at pj penn</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s obviously got to get through</p>
<p>kenny to do that so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be real interesting he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>solid wrestler</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>power puncher you know he hits hard</p>
<p>so i think kenny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to try to use his legs</p>
<p>kenny&rsquo;s got real good leg kicks</p>
<p>real good movement</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>try to use his footwork</p>
<p>work him with leg</p>
<p>kicks and then if it goes to the ground he&rsquo;ll try to</p>
<p>submit him and cut him up with</p>
<p>elbows the thing</p>
<p>about goemi</p>
<p>is goemi has not fought anybody</p>
<p>ever with the</p>
<p>elbow rules you know</p>
<p>elbows are different man</p>
<p>especially the cage</p>
<p>you know cage and elbows</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those are two totally different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never experienced before so it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>gonna be interesting</p>

<p>just struggling</p>
<p>on the road and you know like what it&rsquo;s like to be</p>
<p>an really an amateur</p>
<p>comedian trying to</p>
<p>you know go out there and get people to</p>
<p>laugh for money</p>
<p>and you know and how fucking</p>
<p>crazy it is and</p>
<p>how unsure it is and how</p>
<p>you really have no idea if it&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>gonna work out and you feel</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely insecure</p>
<p>you know you feel like there&rsquo;s no way this is ever</p>
<p>gonna really turn out to be a career</p>
<p>and how nutty some of the fucking gigs i&rsquo;ve done were</p>
<p>why wasn&rsquo;t you at</p>
<p>weigh ins yesterday i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>answer that just because it&rsquo;s so retardedly written</p>
<p>but if somebody else asks it i&rsquo;ll answer it</p>
<p>i was at the</p>
<p>weigh ins because i didn&rsquo;t get in the</p>
<p>time i got my flight didn&rsquo;t land till four o&rsquo;clock so</p>
<p>they had goldberg doodle the weigh</p>
<p>ins and then</p>
<p>i had my show last night</p>
<p>because we were in new york</p>
<p>and then i flew back from new york</p>
<p>sunday i had</p>
<p>monday to stay</p>
<p>home with my family and then tuesday</p>
<p>flew out again</p>
<p>so unless i&rsquo;d stayed here in charlotte</p>
<p>there was no way really i was</p>
<p>gonna be able to</p>
<p>get to the weigh ins but</p>
<p>you know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>this is too much</p>
<p>traveling i need to</p>
<p>be home at least a couple days a week</p>
<p>otherwise i got nutty when you have</p>
<p>babies man you</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t wait to go home and see him you know</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s hardy&rsquo;s arm hardy&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>hardy doesn&rsquo;t have any problems there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with him i can&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>you know his shoulder his arms you know</p>
<p>i think george st pierre</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t quite have the arm bar right</p>
<p>but the kimura there was at one point in time in the</p>
<p>kimorra i thought it was just gonna rip off</p>
<p>i mean it looked it looked pretty bad</p>
<p>oh bring back some chicks from the after party at least</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do that anymore i made</p>
<p>babies and i made it made a wife and all that shit</p>
<p>my doing a show</p>
<p>aziz and zari i don&rsquo;t know him but i think</p>
<p>yeah i think he&rsquo;s on that show</p>
<p>the kevin bean show that i&rsquo;m doing this weekend</p>
<p>april foolishness</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s either friday or saturday night</p>
<p>one of those i&rsquo;m not sure which i&rsquo;ll tell you right now</p>
<p>oh i think it&rsquo;s shower</p>
<p>yeah saturday</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at the gibson amphitheatre and universal</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s way sold out</p>
<p>those guys always sell out their shows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good lineup too a lot of funny comedians</p>
<p>i did it last year with pat naswal did it raven mano</p>
<p>ray romano patton oswald jeff ross</p>
<p>a bunch of good guys i know jeff&rsquo;s on it</p>
<p>again this year i think jay moore&rsquo;s on it</p>
<p>again this year too</p>
<p>is ariani hot or what</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hot if you&rsquo;re not gay</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gay she&rsquo;s probably not hot</p>
<p>the buffer 360 tonight i think he said he would</p>
<p>never do that again i think he said the buffer 360</p>
<p>is gonna retire he&rsquo;s gonna put that shit in the books</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over son</p>
<p>what do i think</p>
<p>about crop circles i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re incredible</p>
<p>geometric patterns</p>
<p>whether not</p>
<p>humans made them</p>
<p>the fuck knows you know i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>argue that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible for people to make them that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you know three times the size of a football</p>
<p>field and they appear overnight and they&rsquo;re in perfect</p>
<p>geometric you know patterns and circles and</p>
<p>everything i don&rsquo;t know you know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very intriguing</p>
<p>you know at the very</p>
<p>least some of</p>
<p>them are fascinating because they&rsquo;re so fucking huge</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>if really i mean if people really are</p>
<p>making these things</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re flattening them out and just leaving them there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wow there&rsquo;s such incredible geometric art you</p>
<p>would think that they</p>
<p>would want to take credit for that</p>
<p>you know if it&rsquo;s just a hoax</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a hoax that they&rsquo;ve kept up for this long</p>
<p>like how sneaky are they</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the benefit of that what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reward i don&rsquo;t know i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have an opinion one way or</p>
<p>another though i am</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s also possible that</p>
<p>it could be some sort of an</p>
<p>experiment that they do to impose geometric patterns in</p>
<p>these fields it</p>
<p>might be something that they do you know</p>
<p>from the sky or something</p>
<p>like that and who the fuck knows how they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>if you talk to some people that</p>
<p>say that these patterns</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re made</p>
<p>that the nodes of these</p>
<p>plants have been</p>
<p>blown out like they&rsquo;ve had energy</p>
<p>pulse through them like microwaves like expanded</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t you know i don&rsquo;t know though</p>
<p>i really personally have not done enough</p>
<p>research and</p>
<p>really paid attention to both sides of the argument</p>
<p>i know one side</p>
<p>of the argument is that it&rsquo;s bullshit and the</p>
<p>other side of the argument is that it&rsquo;s aliens</p>
<p>you know both of them seem pretty</p>
<p>ridiculous so i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not exactly sure</p>
<p>what i think</p>
<p>about that shit</p>
<p>so what i think</p>
<p>about the luke stewart andre galval</p>
<p>fight i thought that fight was really interesting i was</p>
<p>blown away by that luke stewart guy</p>
<p>that guy has incredible</p>
<p>sweeps man he&rsquo;s relentless</p>
<p>i thought he won</p>
<p>the fight i thought he beat him with</p>
<p>stand up and i thought his</p>
<p>ground game</p>
<p>and negated gal vals ground game</p>
<p>and he swept him a bunch of times and</p>
<p>i thought he edged them</p>
<p>you know i thought it was a real close</p>
<p>fight but i thought stewart edged them</p>
<p>but man he blew me away luke stewart is a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m really looking forward to his next</p>
<p>fight that was really really impressive</p>
<p>ufc one fifteen cincinnati</p>
<p>they say that might be possible if</p>
<p>if the the vancouver</p>
<p>thing falls</p>
<p>through i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s falling through or not</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t heard it directly from the</p>
<p>horse&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>so when i hear it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll find out</p>
<p>any more documentaries like the</p>
<p>union coming out yeah i did a documentary on dmt</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called dmt the</p>
<p>spirit molecule and it</p>
<p>should be done</p>
<p>in may and probably out in</p>
<p>for release sometime around the summer</p>
<p>i know they&rsquo;re taking it to film festivals and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bringing it all over the</p>
<p>place but it&rsquo;s a documentary mostly about</p>
<p>different people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>experiences on dmt and i am the narrator</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the deal do i know who bob lazar is</p>
<p>yeah bomb bizarres i got</p>
<p>claims to have worked for area 51 and</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s kind of been discredited with a lot of</p>
<p>things especially like his education i</p>
<p>guess he kind of like</p>
<p>told some lies</p>
<p>about where he went to</p>
<p>school and what his degrees are in but</p>
<p>very very intelligent guy and he obviously knew a lot</p>
<p>about that area</p>
<p>about area 51 whether</p>
<p>or not he really did have any contact with ufos or with</p>
<p>alien spacecraft or any of that</p>
<p>stuff i mean</p>
<p>it could be</p>
<p>total 100 horseshit or it</p>
<p>could be true i mean it&rsquo;s really hard to tell</p>
<p>but when a guy lies</p>
<p>about his education</p>
<p>lies about certain aspects of his</p>
<p>background you</p>
<p>gotta assume that he&rsquo;s probably lied</p>
<p>about other</p>
<p>things as well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>know again i don&rsquo;t really have an opinion either way</p>
<p>interesting don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch him talk though he&rsquo;s very confident</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s very confident</p>
<p>which could mean either a he&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s confident</p>
<p>or b he&rsquo;s telling the truth</p>
<p>all right i got to get the fuck out</p>
<p>of here because the car is picking me up in two minutes</p>
<p>i just wanted to</p>
<p>to bust out</p>
<p>a nice quick one</p>
<p>right here for you guys and say what&rsquo;s up so</p>
<p>thank you everybody for</p>
<p>tuning in and we&rsquo;ll do one</p>
<p>probably this weekend</p>

<p>house and we&rsquo;ll do like a full long ass one</p>
<p>maybe friday</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it my friends</p>
