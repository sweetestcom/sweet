<p>all right Steve let&rsquo;s Dive Right In all</p>
<p>right why don&rsquo;t uh answer some questions</p>
<p>very good let&rsquo;s kick it off with um</p>
<p>uh with our social media crowd which is</p>
<p>enormous in this case YouTube John from</p>
<p>YouTube I recently discovered blood in</p>
<p>my mucus what is wrong how can I fix</p>
<p>this now he didn&rsquo;t discuss where I</p>
<p>assume it&rsquo;s from his whatever nose or</p>
<p>something what&rsquo;s wrong with John</p>
<p>a lot of times I mean when you have a</p>
<p>sinus congestion there&rsquo;s irritation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be some blood I it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not too much of a concern of course I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not trying to diagnose you but I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it too much unless</p>
<p>um it continues and um you know when it</p>
<p>if you if you have some type of</p>
<p>infection in the sinus it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>times there is blood but let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t and you have a nosebleed</p>
<p>um that can be a vitamin C deficiency</p>
<p>possibly or even a vitamin D deficiency</p>
<p>so those are the two things I would look</p>
<p>from a nutritional standpoint of course</p>
<p>um if it&rsquo;s not then check with your</p>
<p>doctor and figure out what what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>very good okay back to social media</p>
<p>again from YouTube Lee nutta from</p>
<p>YouTube I have been struggling with</p>
<p>weakness for years and am easily</p>
<p>agitated I just find it hard to calm</p>
<p>down I also have a brain fog and thyroid</p>
<p>fibroid that sort of Rhymes help</p>
<p>um how can we help uh well if we take</p>
<p>most of those symptoms</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of just going through my mind</p>
<p>like what could that be that most of the</p>
<p>symptoms relate to a B1 deficiency uh</p>
<p>agitation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so I think if you took um</p>
<p>some thymine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>from nutritional yeast or just I mean I</p>
<p>think you would actually and try to find</p>
<p>the natural version of course the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast make sure it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fortified with the synthetics and I</p>
<p>think if you did that you would feel a</p>
<p>lot better within probably about three</p>
<p>to four minutes</p>
<p>um but uh B1</p>
<p>will help you with brain fog but of</p>
<p>course you have to understand maybe why</p>
<p>you became deficient in B1 and that has</p>
<p>to do with these things called</p>
<p>carbohydrates sugar pasta things like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um when you consume more sugar or carbs</p>
<p>the requirement for B goes way up and</p>
<p>many people if they&rsquo;re doing that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take the B and they end up with</p>
<p>all the side effects of this</p>
<p>this material that creates blood sugar</p>
<p>issues and a lot of deficiencies so B1</p>
<p>is a really powerful simple remedy that</p>
<p>I would I would jump on boy and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you just from personal uh</p>
<p>experience all the symptoms she</p>
<p>described it&rsquo;s just me eating like crap</p>
<p>you know when I eat tons of sugar and</p>
<p>carburets I&rsquo;m just carbohydrates I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just out of it uh mentally I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>there I had the T-shirt I totally</p>
<p>understand oh that&rsquo;s terrible so go girl</p>
<p>okay next up Aphrodite I like that from</p>
<p>Facebook YouTube Excuse me and she wants</p>
<p>to know if keto is safe for someone with</p>
<p>the awful condition MS</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essential it&rsquo;s essential because</p>
<p>keto is going to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>especially of the brain you want that</p>
<p>brain to run off ketones not glucose and</p>
<p>so you want to convert over the field</p>
<p>fuel to low carbs to get your body</p>
<p>burning ketones which is going to feed</p>
<p>the brain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know make sure you take a lot more</p>
<p>vitamin D3</p>
<p>but boy if you have MS</p>
<p>um you need to be on keto desperately</p>
<p>and start doing fasting</p>
<p>some prolonged fasting because you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually regrow brain cells and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll do much much better</p>
<p>all right very good now I&rsquo;m sure the</p>
<p>audience is coming out with pitchforks</p>
<p>and torches because I haven&rsquo;t introduced</p>
<p>the first question yet so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give them what they want there you go</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>okay so the first question is the most</p>
<p>common vitamin deficiency in numb hands</p>
<p>is fill in the blank drum roll folks</p>
<p>okay get on that which you always do and</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we kick it over to the um</p>
<p>the green room and I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>selfishly start with Cameron he&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>the highlands in Northern Scotland and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna he knows I&rsquo;ve shared with him</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to Scotland with my</p>
<p>daughter in a few months and he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to give me advice on how to avoid haggis</p>
<p>at all possible costs so uh anyway let</p>
<p>me get him on here and Cameron you sir</p>
<p>are on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg thanks for having me on</p>
<p>so my question today is on eye floaters</p>
<p>in last week&rsquo;s life he said there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>blood vessels in the eye and no</p>
<p>lymphatic system so with the signs of</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s a closed system if that were</p>
<p>the case how can autophagy work and how</p>
<p>can MSM work or is that particular</p>
<p>product just a suppressant yeah so when</p>
<p>I meant no blood vessels in the eye I</p>
<p>met no blood vessels in the lens of the</p>
<p>eye</p>
<p>which is uh they have a lot of blood</p>
<p>vessels in the eye but uh in the lens of</p>
<p>the eye so it gets its nutrition</p>
<p>um osmotically from the fluid around</p>
<p>that lens</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s a very special environment</p>
<p>with its own immune system you can</p>
<p>actually do grafting and there won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to be any rejection from the immune</p>
<p>system which is interesting so it has</p>
<p>this special immune its own immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>um now as far as autophagy to the eye</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s a lot of autophagy going on</p>
<p>but to the lens</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there must also be a lot of autophagy</p>
<p>going on because it has to withstand</p>
<p>tremendous trauma uh throughout your</p>
<p>life uh and just I mean just think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>out think about how much um</p>
<p>oxygen it&rsquo;s exposed to oxidation and</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>um but what happens over time is you get</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re diabetic you get</p>
<p>this uh glycation this uh protein that</p>
<p>starts to create problems and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>the number one problem with the lens is</p>
<p>that glycation from diabetes which is</p>
<p>developing into this um opaque um</p>
<p>material cataracts</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you said like the MSM drops</p>
<p>right you were talking about yeah</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>um that is going to allow</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some it can acts as a very very</p>
<p>powerful</p>
<p>antioxidant and um it can hopefully if</p>
<p>it depending on how advanced it is can</p>
<p>help minimize the damage in there and</p>
<p>maybe reverse some of it but it really</p>
<p>depends on how long it&rsquo;s gone but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been quite a few people that are</p>
<p>successful with those drops it&rsquo;s worth a</p>
<p>shot</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>MSM is very soluble so it can penetrate</p>
<p>certain things and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>have hardly any side effects so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth a shot</p>
<p>um and what do you have to lose I mean</p>
<p>just a few dollars from that but uh</p>
<p>because when you have um these problems</p>
<p>with the with the vision like what are</p>
<p>you gonna do there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>solutions other than uh</p>
<p>cortisol drive or steroid drops which</p>
<p>then really come with a lot of side</p>
<p>effects so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t know if I released that</p>
<p>video or not but I I should be releasing</p>
<p>the video on the on the lens of the eye</p>
<p>very soon so you can get even more</p>
<p>information on that topic but but really</p>
<p>good questions awesome thank you very</p>
<p>much that&rsquo;s great thank you Cameron of</p>
<p>course I&rsquo;ll probably run into one of</p>
<p>your many castles up there so won&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>be oh there&rsquo;s one there&rsquo;s one more thing</p>
<p>I want to mention um Steve about the eye</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um you know I&rsquo;ve had a lot of</p>
<p>eye injuries for some reason like my</p>
<p>daughter once when she was really young</p>
<p>had a had an envelope and he was holding</p>
<p>it and hit me from the side and actually</p>
<p>sliced my cornea</p>
<p>ouch so I had a lot of issues with the</p>
<p>eye and so what um</p>
<p>what I found that is was really helpful</p>
<p>for any type of eye injuries if you have</p>
<p>an eye injury you can do a search on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the oculotrophin PMG</p>
<p>oculotrophone PMG from Standard Process</p>
<p>you take one of those</p>
<p>um I swear within like probably a half</p>
<p>hour all of a sudden your eye just seems</p>
<p>to do better it&rsquo;s it has certain factors</p>
<p>that support the eye it&rsquo;s probably one</p>
<p>of the best products for eyes that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever seen but it&rsquo;s mainly for injury to</p>
<p>the eye and um and you just take</p>
<p>probably one before bed</p>
<p>um and uh I always keep some of my</p>
<p>my sea of my warehouse of nutrients and</p>
<p>stuff because uh boy if you need it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that really comes in handy</p>
<p>well there you go Cameron thanks so much</p>
<p>for joining us we sure appreciate it and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh no answers to the question</p>
<p>oh no I&rsquo;m wrong it was immediate answer</p>
<p>to the question and the question asked</p>
<p>uh the most common vitamin deficiency in</p>
<p>numb hands is and our audience claims at</p>
<p>least 55 percent of them say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vitamin B12 15 say vitamin B1 15 say</p>
<p>vitamin D and the final 15 say vitamin</p>
<p>B6 any winners</p>
<p>yes B12</p>
<p>I mean B12 is one of those key things</p>
<p>involving</p>
<p>making what&rsquo;s called myelin sheath which</p>
<p>is the coating around the nerve of the</p>
<p>spinal column especially the spinal</p>
<p>column and um</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re deficient in B12 apparently</p>
<p>it affects a certain part of the spinal</p>
<p>column in your neck in your upper back</p>
<p>and it can start to create structural</p>
<p>problems to the point where you can even</p>
<p>see see it on MRI</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to end up giving you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called paresthesia which is an</p>
<p>altered sensation in the hands and the</p>
<p>feet and that can be numbness tingling</p>
<p>pins and needles burning even coldness</p>
<p>many people with cold feet for example</p>
<p>are really just deficient in B12 from</p>
<p>two two ways one is the</p>
<p>the problem actually coming from your</p>
<p>neck going down into your feet not even</p>
<p>in your lower back necessarily as well</p>
<p>as creating anemia a certain type of</p>
<p>anemia which can also make you cold</p>
<p>and um why are people</p>
<p>um deficient in B12</p>
<p>well as they get older they lose the</p>
<p>stomach acid that&rsquo;s a big one another</p>
<p>one is the genetic mutation that is very</p>
<p>common it&rsquo;s probably like 30 percent of</p>
<p>the population has this certain Gene</p>
<p>problem that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow them to absorb folate and</p>
<p>b12 that makes folate work</p>
<p>so they need a product called</p>
<p>methylcobolamine and methylfolate with a</p>
<p>little B6 in there and boy they can feel</p>
<p>so much better if they do that so just</p>
<p>want to bring your awareness up if you</p>
<p>start to get any type of paresthesia in</p>
<p>your hands or your feet</p>
<p>or um even like sometimes neck pain</p>
<p>without an injury it could cut it could</p>
<p>it could be that problem</p>
<p>and um and then if you&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>that connection boy you could go through</p>
<p>a lot of unnecessary procedures and</p>
<p>expensive treatments without any results</p>
<p>at all but</p>
<p>B12 is really important in the myelin</p>
<p>sheath among many other problems that</p>
<p>you might might experience all right</p>
<p>very good or ever watchful uh producer</p>
<p>Terry says that this next question is a</p>
<p>perfect segue from what you just said</p>
<p>and the question is from Paul on</p>
<p>Facebook I get cold when I eat my hands</p>
<p>and feet stay cold and I get cold very</p>
<p>easily any suggestions I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related but there you have it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good that&rsquo;s an interesting one</p>
<p>when you eat</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s probably your body telling you</p>
<p>need to fast longer I don&rsquo;t know but um</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>it probably has something to do with</p>
<p>circulation and digestion and I would um</p>
<p>when I did Dark field microscopy which</p>
<p>is uh you&rsquo;re looking at blood</p>
<p>um I do know there&rsquo;s a condition that</p>
<p>you have this with people that um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t digest proteins that well that can</p>
<p>actually create problems in the blood so</p>
<p>one really good remedy would be betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride simple remedy to help you</p>
<p>digest protein and that might just heat</p>
<p>you up because it allows you to digest</p>
<p>proteins much better</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s always good to play around with</p>
<p>the amount of protein someone consumes</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know it really varies depending on</p>
<p>age metabolism that type of thing some</p>
<p>people do better with a little less</p>
<p>protein some people do better with more</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I know if I have too much protein</p>
<p>I feel a little sluggish I feel sluggish</p>
<p>but I I seem to do really well</p>
<p>at about honest about six to seven</p>
<p>ounces of protein per meal not not more</p>
<p>than that I just do really well if I go</p>
<p>too much I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t feel quite</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s good to play around with</p>
<p>the amounts and see what your body needs</p>
<p>interesting okay well uh and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>just interested there&rsquo;s people all over</p>
<p>the world interested and so let&rsquo;s give a</p>
<p>shout out to everybody all of our</p>

<p>across these United States boy a growing</p>
<p>list that is so great that you know we</p>
<p>may have some differences around the</p>
<p>world but I tell you what the way our</p>
<p>health and and emotions and all that are</p>
<p>just absolutely on on tap with each</p>
<p>other so it&rsquo;s wonderful that everyone</p>
<p>can learn to share these great facts and</p>
<p>findings from Dr Berg and live better</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m among them thank you folks for that</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see um PJ from Facebook what</p>
<p>are your thoughts on B12 injections does</p>
<p>that make any difference doc</p>
<p>yeah you know it&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>when you take an injection of B12 um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bypassing the normal</p>
<p>you know way to absorb it and and for</p>
<p>some people they don&rsquo;t necessarily have</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s called the intrinsic factor or</p>
<p>they have stomach problems and they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t absorb it I think sublingual would</p>
<p>be a good option but</p>
<p>I talked to a guy</p>
<p>his name was Dr</p>
<p>not Royal Lee but Leo Roy before he died</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an old-timer that used to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>medical doctor who used to give those</p>
<p>B12 injections and he said</p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;ve never done it there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of problems with it</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what he told me and uh this</p>
<p>was like probably like</p>
<p>it must have been 25 years ago and he</p>
<p>said yeah you don&rsquo;t want to take your</p>
<p>B12 like that it makes you feel really</p>
<p>good but then you kind of go downhill</p>
<p>after that so it kind of stuck with me I</p>
<p>never found out exactly all the details</p>
<p>to it but um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not crazy about um</p>
<p>the vitamin injections and stuff like</p>
<p>that especially they&rsquo;re probably going</p>
<p>to be synthetic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I know the problem with absorption</p>
<p>so why can&rsquo;t we just do</p>
<p>um higher amounts and um do it that way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>um people are taking higher amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin D3 or even B12 to penetrate that</p>
<p>barrier but um</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not crazy about the</p>
<p>injections all right very good let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to uh back to social media and Mike from</p>
<p>YouTube Dr Berg would you recommend</p>
<p>ashwagandha for erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>unfortunately that affects a lot of boys</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it is a good remedy for</p>
<p>erectile dysfunction it is a good remedy</p>
<p>for sure</p>
<p>um you also want to add zinc zinc is</p>
<p>another good remedy</p>
<p>um and also make sure that your sugar</p>
<p>levels are good you&rsquo;re on the carb no</p>
<p>carb diet make sure your sleeping is</p>
<p>good I recently did a video on this</p>
<p>topic and</p>
<p>um because I&rsquo;m always updating things</p>
<p>and I found some great information but</p>
<p>ashwagandha is a really good one because</p>
<p>because it actually helps you reduce</p>
<p>cortisol which will literally create a</p>
<p>problem with your testosterone and other</p>
<p>hormones so ashwagon is a really good</p>
<p>adaptogen</p>
<p>I like it um</p>
<p>and a lot of people are going through</p>
<p>stress Believe It or Not Steve so</p>
<p>anything you do to improve that is a</p>
<p>good thing no kidding let&rsquo;s see I</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one question I wanted and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost it all I know is oh here he is</p>
<p>Rocky Rocky from Facebook has lost 50</p>
<p>pounds on keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but now he stopped and he wants to go</p>
<p>down another 30. what should he do on</p>
<p>this plateau</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to without information</p>
<p>about him but I think I would go through</p>
<p>the standard things right make sure your</p>
<p>carbs are as low as possible</p>
<p>make sure that you um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the exact macros make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the healthy version of Keto</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re sleeping really look at</p>
<p>the stress sometimes especially if you</p>
<p>have a slow metabolism and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>a lot of fat Okay</p>
<p>um well your body&rsquo;s going to go after</p>
<p>that before your own fat so maybe you</p>
<p>lower the fat a little bit at least</p>
<p>initially and then the last thing to do</p>
<p>which is really important is fast longer</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not doing omad one meal a day</p>
<p>go to one mat one meal a day and for</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>they need to eat one meal every other</p>
<p>day and that&rsquo;s what they need</p>
<p>simply because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>insulin resistance is so bad that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take something a lot more</p>
<p>powerful to create the change that they</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>now is there any time you just remain</p>
<p>insulin resistant for your life</p>
<p>regardless of your sort of new Behavior</p>
<p>can most people get past that no they</p>
<p>can they can you can always improve</p>
<p>insulin resistance</p>
<p>um but the the time it takes to recover</p>
<p>is a lot of times greater than what you</p>
<p>think I mean it could take months to</p>
<p>even a few years on some people why</p>
<p>because they spent their whole life</p>
<p>eating high carbs like myself and it</p>
<p>really just messes with the uh with the</p>
<p>receptors and then it&rsquo;s funny because</p>
<p>some people think in their mind</p>
<p>okay when am I going to be corrected so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing great everything&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>their blood sugar is normal their</p>
<p>insulin&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>right and then they think</p>
<p>now that it&rsquo;s corrected they can go back</p>
<p>to carbs I&rsquo;m like I think you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>the point</p>
<p>um because what caused it is the higher</p>
<p>amount of carbs so</p>
<p>it is a lifelong thing you have to do it</p>
<p>over a period of time and then stick</p>
<p>with it find something that you can do</p>
<p>long term but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like um I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>best analogy but</p>
<p>um I fixed my carburetor why do I have</p>
<p>to keep um</p>
<p>feeding at the right kind of gasoline</p>
<p>well because the car runs on certain</p>
<p>maybe non-ethanol gasoline you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good comparison so uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>how about another question doc they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>itching for it here you go</p>
<p>all right true or false the primary</p>
<p>reason for low mineral levels in plants</p>
<p>is a lack of minerals in the soil</p>
<p>all right dig into that including my</p>
<p>friend Billy Miller who&rsquo;s out there I</p>
<p>want to give him a shout out so Billy</p>
<p>see if he can answer the question along</p>
<p>with the thousands of other people that</p>
<p>participate weekly on the Dr Berg show</p>
<p>okay why don&rsquo;t we speaking of</p>
<p>participation we have the lovely Marina</p>
<p>from the UK and uh she has a question</p>
<p>for you right now</p>
<p>hello Dr Burke I&rsquo;m honored to be chosen</p>
<p>I think I think your mic is I can&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>oh no I can there we go okay can you can</p>
<p>you hear me now yes</p>
<p>and firstly I wanna I wanna thank you</p>
<p>for having me</p>
<p>um today I would like to ask you a</p>
<p>question about a ketogenic diet on</p>
<p>autistic</p>
<p>person lately I watched one of your</p>
<p>videos explaining how good is that to do</p>
<p>for autistic children but well my my</p>
<p>child is not a no longer child he&rsquo;s 19</p>
<p>years old but he&rsquo;s non-verbal</p>
<p>so uh I I watched that my video and I</p>
<p>have some questions please in regards to</p>
<p>ketogenic diet because</p>
<p>um you are mentioning that these</p>
<p>children need to stay away from complete</p>
<p>gluten and also casein now in his case</p>
<p>um he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s very much his lover and I</p>
<p>was wondering if there will be any</p>
<p>alternative to to help him to deal with</p>
<p>the keto diet and I also purchased some</p>
<p>supplements I would like to mention if</p>
<p>you allow me which is a bhakti cleanse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vitamin K2 B1</p>
<p>tootcom</p>
<p>popcorn de toxodine cod liver oil</p>
<p>ip6 and inosito</p>
<p>and I was con I was considering to do</p>
<p>ceramine treatments but that&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>unavailable in UK so please if you can</p>
<p>briefly</p>
<p>advise me please well thank you for that</p>
<p>one question and I&rsquo;m just being</p>
<p>sarcastic right okay so um I think your</p>
<p>son can do case scene unless he has</p>
<p>analogy</p>
<p>um the best thing you probably can get</p>
<p>better than in the US is um the raw milk</p>
<p>cheeses raw milk cheeses um give you the</p>
<p>probiotics give you the protein and they</p>
<p>give you the calcium that you need</p>
<p>um so if you could find the Ramones</p>
<p>raw milk cheeses oh my God that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>cheese yeah</p>
<p>okay so thank you thank you for this</p>
<p>and then um I think those other</p>
<p>supplements sound sound great</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t see a problem with them but</p>
<p>uh now as far as the gluten goes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some of the</p>
<p>ancient Wheats which I don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>into that don&rsquo;t even know they have</p>
<p>gluten it doesn&rsquo;t seem to create a a</p>
<p>problem with gluten but gluten is the</p>
<p>only protein</p>
<p>that is not digested in humans so we</p>
<p>have a problem with that but the cool</p>
<p>thing about keto is you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about it because you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be consuming grains so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting</p>
<p>um but I think</p>
<p>um your your your child I&rsquo;ll just say</p>
<p>your older child I think they can do</p>
<p>extremely healthy and keto boy if I</p>
<p>would have started at his age it would</p>
<p>have been a I would have been in much</p>
<p>better shape but um</p>
<p>that do the healthy version and then of</p>
<p>course we do have a a great Russian</p>
<p>Channel I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re probably already</p>
<p>watching that too with all the different</p>
<p>videos we have con translated to Russian</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re probably already looking at</p>
<p>that right now but um</p>
<p>yeah so um</p>
<p>I do I do regular</p>
<p>uh cheese I try to find the raw milk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy but um it&rsquo;s so much better</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well listen thank you</p>
<p>so much Marina we&rsquo;d love to hear back</p>
<p>from you on how everything goes with</p>
<p>your family and thank you very much</p>
<p>thanks thank you so much appreciate you</p>
<p>joining us uh and I&rsquo;ll tell you who else</p>
<p>is always uh watching carefully and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our audience because they</p>
<p>answered that last question in like</p>
<p>milliseconds it&rsquo;s unbelievable and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a consensus there the question</p>
<p>was the primary it was a true false or</p>
<p>the primary reason for low minerals in</p>
<p>plants is a lack of minerals in soil is</p>
<p>what you ask and 98 of a respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true and there&rsquo;s two percent</p>
<p>holdouts say nope it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>yeah the two percent are correct what</p>
<p>this is this is new information for a</p>
<p>lot of people but um there is a study</p>
<p>and I did a video on it of This research</p>
<p>who went around all around the world</p>
<p>measuring soils and he found that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a mineral deficiency in the</p>
<p>soil at all</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s going on right because it is</p>
<p>true we have lower trace minerals we</p>
<p>have lower minerals in the plants</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing in this</p>
<p>equation what is the missing link and it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>the biology the microbial life the</p>
<p>Diversified of microbes and the bacteria</p>
<p>to fungal ratios in our soils that is</p>
<p>the problem uh there&rsquo;s some recent</p>
<p>information by Professor James White</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>fascinating guy I just I talked to him a</p>
<p>few days ago and I want to be doing some</p>
<p>experiments that he mentioned but uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a great</p>
<p>majority of the plants nutrition</p>
<p>minerals comes from eating microbes</p>
<p>yeah they actually eat the microbes the</p>
<p>bacteria and then they extract the</p>
<p>nutrients and they spit the micro up to</p>
<p>go back and get more minerals so they</p>
<p>have this exchange so the um apparently</p>
<p>you know plants will try to get it</p>
<p>whatever nutrition it can but it can</p>
<p>also get it passively to some degree</p>
<p>from the minerals being there but the</p>
<p>the microbe is what mobilizes with their</p>
<p>acids and enzymes these minerals and</p>
<p>they bring them back into the plant and</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t understand that fact you</p>
<p>are going to be susceptible to being</p>
<p>okay with oh let&rsquo;s sterilize the soil</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s use glyphosate which is considered</p>
<p>an antibiotic they patent it as</p>
<p>antibiotic you kill off the microbes you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take care of the microbes and now</p>
<p>that poor Plant is dependent on</p>
<p>you know fertilizers and um inputs that</p>
<p>you have to add all these minerals</p>
<p>constantly or or it&rsquo;s not going to get</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>so this is huge important information in</p>
<p>um also why when you buy food at the</p>
<p>grocery store and you&rsquo;re like it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t taste like anything well because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably grown on soils that are</p>
<p>not very rich in microbes</p>
<p>um so when you have your own soil and</p>
<p>you grow it boy it&rsquo;s such a difference</p>
<p>so this micro connection is a very</p>
<p>important thing and um</p>
<p>and this is another reason why you could</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p>you know you can do a lot better when</p>
<p>you start eating more fermented like</p>
<p>sauerkraut and things like that because</p>
<p>you have this enhanced microbial</p>
<p>um I mean even like uh sauerkraut has</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of vitamin C</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s vitamin K2</p>
<p>because of those microbes</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>another reason why you should have try</p>
<p>to find</p>
<p>a lot of your food from the farmer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>market or Farmers that really care about</p>
<p>growing and we are going to be having a</p>
<p>a new YouTube channel on how to grow</p>
<p>your own food like really healthy right</p>
<p>not even in your backyard in your house</p>
<p>wow okay not hydroponic not hydroponic</p>
<p>either but we&rsquo;re going to show you how</p>
<p>to do that</p>
<p>um very soon I&rsquo;m very excited about that</p>
<p>but um that way you can for pennies grow</p>
<p>your own food and at least your salad</p>
<p>and your greens and make it really</p>
<p>healthy so stay tuned for that boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exciting but audience the poor</p>
<p>audience 98 of you came up short but I</p>
<p>gotta admit I was with you I was already</p>
<p>gloating thinking I was smart with the</p>
<p>nutrients and all that but anyway we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned a lot together</p>
<p>uh two percent of you are very smart and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give the audience another chance</p>
<p>to redeem themselves with the next</p>
<p>question here it is</p>
<p>okay in what way does selenium okay help</p>
<p>your thyroid</p>
<p>all right folks</p>
<p>keep your thyroid healthy and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>by the way we just always love this no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s left out uh more people said hey</p>
<p>how about us so let&rsquo;s do another shout</p>
<p>out to Cuba Albania Argentina uh Bahrain</p>
<p>Slovenia and Zimbabwe so welcome all</p>
<p>your other folks on there from the</p>
<p>African continent and uh we&rsquo;re glad that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching and learning okay Marge</p>
<p>from Facebook is there anything I can do</p>
<p>for a hemifacial spasm you ever heard of</p>
<p>that dog</p>
<p>yeah and I just wanna I know probably</p>
<p>some people let me just get back to that</p>
<p>last question real fast just because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one little extra point I know</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to say oh I disagree</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true there&rsquo;s certain soils</p>
<p>are missing certain individual nutrients</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;s absolutely true but</p>
<p>the majority of the minerals generally</p>
<p>speaking are in there um now</p>
<p>there could be a situation you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>depleting the heck out of everything and</p>
<p>then you just end up with rocks well the</p>
<p>minerals are on the rocks</p>
<p>and that comes the rocks turn into</p>
<p>eventually the soil from the help of the</p>
<p>microbe we need the microbe to make this</p>
<p>whole process happen we need the fungus</p>
<p>to help break down trees and plants and</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>anyone that disagrees with that uh</p>
<p>just kind of take the theme of this</p>
<p>these microbial entities that are really</p>
<p>so important and it&rsquo;s really missing in</p>
<p>our in our food supply as well as in the</p>
<p>soil supply</p>
<p>now as far as the muscles and the</p>
<p>twitching and the spasm of the face</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>factors to look at you have</p>
<p>some of the electrolytes like magnesium</p>
<p>and even calcium work together and even</p>
<p>potassium and the pH to allow those</p>
<p>minerals to be conducted</p>
<p>through the nervous system and be</p>
<p>conducted through the muscles so to have</p>
<p>everything interact and and not and</p>
<p>avoid these little maybe</p>
<p>um spasms or Twitches or</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>those little um or tetany all these</p>
<p>things that can happen in in the in your</p>
<p>whole body</p>
<p>um many times it&rsquo;s a Calcium deficiency</p>
<p>but many times it&rsquo;s also a pH problem uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not um</p>
<p>you need to acidify the body and because</p>
<p>you can get rid of it by taking like</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar that seems to help</p>
<p>those twitches and muscle spasms that</p>
<p>can occur anywhere in your body in the</p>
<p>calf and your legs</p>
<p>in your face</p>
<p>um and so it&rsquo;s kind of like when you get</p>
<p>like a little spasm in your face you</p>
<p>either need more calcium magnesium or</p>
<p>you or you need to drop your pH to make</p>
<p>it more acidic</p>
<p>okay very good well next up we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>back to the green room and we have</p>
<p>Abraham from Modesto and he was so well</p>
<p>behaved last time we brought him on</p>
<p>again and he has some great news about</p>
<p>your gallbladder formula go ahead</p>
<p>Abraham you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burke</p>
<p>hello Dr Burke hi</p>
<p>yes uh we call bladder for me it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>working great for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been helping me with my Digestive</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made my stool regular so</p>
<p>the question I do have is how long will</p>
<p>it take not having a gallbladder to lose</p>
<p>or burn fat</p>
<p>well um a lot of the fat that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be burning is not really</p>
<p>necessarily going to be coming from</p>
<p>that missing gallbladder that you or the</p>
<p>bile that&rsquo;s not gonna that&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>what breaks down</p>
<p>um the actual fat around your body it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mainly from your digestive fat that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help extract certain things</p>
<p>with the help of the pancreas</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s other enzymes in your body</p>
<p>um that are going to do the breaking</p>
<p>down of fat and what controls that</p>
<p>mechanism</p>
<p>is not bile it is going to be um</p>
<p>insulin having insulin being low enough</p>
<p>to have this um</p>
<p>fat enzyme start act being activated in</p>
<p>the presence of just a little too much</p>
<p>insulin these enzymes are kind of like</p>
<p>oh inactive</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>enzymes do all the work in the body and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re controlled by pH by</p>
<p>hormones by just the right environment</p>
<p>so what does all that mean in simple</p>
<p>terms</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to burn burn fat</p>
<p>as long as you keep your carbs low and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t eat too frequently</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um the bile that&rsquo;s going to be more for</p>
<p>digestion</p>
<p>okay thank you that&rsquo;s great a man of few</p>
<p>words but says so much that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>thanks again for coming back and and</p>
<p>again we really love people</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>um coming back and letting us know the</p>
<p>good news or sometimes you know more</p>
<p>struggles because Dr Berg&rsquo;s here to help</p>
<p>everyone in that regard all right let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um quiz question number three which asks</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your chance to redeem yourself</p>
<p>audience in what way does selenium help</p>
<p>your thyroid and</p>
<p>um sixty percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>selenium promotes or protects iodine</p>
<p>production 30 say it balances the</p>
<p>operation of thyroid uh and 10 say it</p>
<p>helps with metabolism very lofty</p>
<p>thoughts and answers or do we have any</p>
<p>uh we brought them back into good favor</p>
<p>selenium is involved as a helper for a</p>
<p>lot of different enzymes those things</p>
<p>that that make things work in the body</p>
<p>but specifically for the thyroid it</p>
<p>helps in the this conversion from um T4</p>
<p>to T3 from the inactive thyroid to the</p>
<p>active thyroid so let&rsquo;s say your thyroid</p>
<p>is sluggish is it that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>producing enough thyroid hormone or is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not converting the the</p>
<p>active form in which case you need more</p>
<p>selenium so for example in Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>which really comprises over 80 or 90</p>
<p>percent of all</p>
<p>um hypothyroid</p>
<p>problems with the autoimmune the the</p>
<p>real one of the biggest problems is that</p>
<p>conversion factor more than anything so</p>
<p>this is why selenium is even more</p>
<p>important than iodine too much iodine</p>
<p>can be a problem so selenium is um a</p>
<p>trace mineral you don&rsquo;t need it in large</p>
<p>amounts I mean really I think the rdas</p>
<p>are between 50 and 70 micrograms okay</p>
<p>not milligrams micrograms just tiny</p>
<p>amounts and um</p>
<p>I will be releasing a video on</p>
<p>why selenium</p>
<p>is highest in the Brazil nut out of all</p>
<p>the nuts like that&rsquo;s pretty odd why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be in other types of nuts or</p>
<p>plants and stuff like that but it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the Brazil nut it&rsquo;s another things too</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>yeah you need that conversion that</p>
<p>activation from the inactive to the</p>
<p>active for sure for it to work</p>
<p>okay now Jermaine from Facebook says I</p>
<p>love love love that you&rsquo;re addressing</p>
<p>the issue of growing your own food I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>planning my superfood garden now can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait to watch your new YouTube channel</p>
<p>me too doc the idea of scattering dirt</p>
<p>around my wife&rsquo;s living room it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>such a fun no I we really want to do it</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really cool and by the</p>
<p>way we tried I got a little cherry</p>
<p>tomatoes out on the balcony and I&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>third floor condo and by gosh it works</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like magic they grow and I eat them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how Healthy Mind ours but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible so we&rsquo;re all excited</p>
<p>about that Dr Burke thanks so much for</p>
<p>uh yeah that&rsquo;s going to be I have two um</p>
<p>you know I like I might mention I went</p>
<p>all of all over Europe to visit</p>
<p>different farms and I&rsquo;ve been really</p>
<p>interested in farming I have my own farm</p>
<p>and I found</p>
<p>um two really top Farmers that um I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working closely with and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna help me with this YouTube channel</p>
<p>they grow some of the best plan plant a</p>
<p>salad type things and microgreens and</p>
<p>everything on actual soil not hydroponic</p>
<p>which makes a world of difference</p>
<p>because unfortunately when you buy salad</p>
<p>at the grocery store many times it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>especially in the winter it&rsquo;s grown</p>
<p>hydroponically</p>
<p>and so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um well I probably should stop right</p>
<p>there because that&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>question of the next topic but the point</p>
<p>is these two farmers are going to help</p>
<p>me with this new YouTube channel and</p>
<p>make it really simple so boy you could</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not be really dependent on anyone but</p>
<p>yourself as far as your food and start</p>
<p>growing some</p>
<p>seriously healthy nutrient dense and uh</p>
<p>my my hat on that is going to be doing</p>
<p>all the testing</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;ll be some really fascinating</p>
<p>research I&rsquo;m going to do and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to share all that with everyone so they</p>
<p>can benefit from the but this where do</p>
<p>you see what we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>where do you see some of the the videos</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re planning them right now it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually I think it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>mind-blowing wow and with Worldwide</p>
<p>inflation and so on that&rsquo;s an exciting</p>
<p>premise you know to have really healthy</p>
<p>food for less so I think you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get more people coming on to that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh here&rsquo;s an interesting question uh</p>
<p>uh hemang from YouTube is there a</p>
<p>significant difference in a 23 hour fast</p>
<p>versus a 36 hour fast and what are your</p>
<p>thoughts about using Truvia and</p>
<p>erythritol</p>
<p>yeah if I&rsquo;m trivia</p>
<p>um I I would have to look at the</p>
<p>ingredients closer I think it&rsquo;s okay but</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t sometimes I think they use monk</p>
<p>fruit and erythritol if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>just make sure they don&rsquo;t add any</p>
<p>maltodextrin in there that&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>problem with some of these sweeteners</p>
<p>um but as far as the difference between</p>
<p>a 24 and a 36 hour fast yeah it</p>
<p>definitely if you start adding some more</p>
<p>hours in there you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll get a</p>
<p>little more bang for your buck</p>
<p>especially for your brain and especially</p>
<p>for the immune system uh the longer you</p>
<p>go boy the magic starts happening now</p>
<p>with about a seven day fast how often</p>
<p>should you do that</p>
<p>every week no</p>
<p>um these longer fast</p>
<p>um now if you have cancer yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>necessity you have to do it but I think</p>
<p>um once a year to do a seven day fast</p>
<p>would be perfect I wouldn&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>need to do them more frequently unless</p>
<p>you have some health condition that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to fix um I like the</p>
<p>period like three day fast I like the</p>
<p>periodic 40 uh two day fast and</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>just make sure that you&rsquo;re um you watch</p>
<p>my videos on that because when people</p>
<p>start reintroducing food there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to do it</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t want to just eat a lot of</p>
<p>food right after a long uh prolonged</p>
<p>fast that can create a lot of problems I</p>
<p>made those mistakes so I learned from my</p>
<p>mistakes all right very good next up</p>
<p>from the Green Room is harshita now</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from India and I love Indian food</p>
<p>so I personally hold the entire</p>
<p>continent responsible for at least 10</p>
<p>pounds of my overgrowth it&rsquo;s just well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m sure the uh the Indian food</p>
<p>in America is exactly same the same as</p>
<p>in India I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m certain just like</p>
<p>sweet and sour chicken is traditional</p>
<p>Chinese so anyway go ahead and just</p>
<p>start the exact same thing thanks a lot</p>
<p>for a little extra pudginess on my</p>
<p>behalf Hershey to go ahead with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hello Dr Burke first of all thank you so</p>
<p>much for everything you&rsquo;re doing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been following you since last six months</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and it has helped</p>
<p>me a lot great so doc I have Sjogren&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fibromyalgia</p>
<p>hypothyroid asthma</p>
<p>sibo and candida</p>
<p>and I am a lacto of a vegetarian</p>
<p>I have been doing the 20 hour</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking pretty much all your</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>um after watching your videos</p>
<p>and I have a lot of opportunity</p>
<p>tightness</p>
<p>upper</p>
<p>tummy tightness and pain</p>
<p>trapezius pain</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s um upper tummy pain oh okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of tightness yeah yeah</p>
<p>okay and I&rsquo;m very low on energy</p>
<p>constantly yeah</p>
<p>yeah okay so</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know how to do keto</p>
<p>um on low carbs I&rsquo;m not doing any sugar</p>
<p>not doing any gluten but I cannot really</p>
<p>do keto with sibo and candida because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>all right well can you give me an</p>
<p>example of what your last meal was</p>
<p>yes I had eggs and quinoa okay</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple things you need</p>
<p>to to do</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s the problem if you have sibo</p>
<p>this means that there&rsquo;s the bacteria in</p>
<p>the wrong place it&rsquo;s in the small</p>
<p>intestine and so when you do quinoa</p>
<p>or even big salads or nuts or beans or</p>
<p>any of these things</p>
<p>wow you&rsquo;re going to have upper tummy</p>
<p>crampiness why because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting fermentation in the wrong</p>
<p>place and now we have a very difficult</p>
<p>time to even get rid of candida which is</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>which is in the fungus family that tends</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>reg it&rsquo;s regulated by</p>
<p>that correct microbiome which you have a</p>
<p>disembalance</p>
<p>I mean I even tell people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re gonna you this may</p>
<p>not work for your lifestyle but uh being</p>
<p>a carnivore for a couple months might</p>
<p>kind of shock you but that may be the</p>
<p>answer because</p>
<p>how are you going to get rid of the</p>
<p>microbes other than an antibiotic which</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to do how are you going to</p>
<p>get rid of those microbes um</p>
<p>that that ferment with fiber okay how</p>
<p>are you going to go on a no fiber diet</p>
<p>and um without doing carnivore it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible</p>
<p>um but you are doing eggs so that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um so can you do fish</p>
<p>I can if I have to I would do fish and</p>
<p>eggs and um and just see if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel better and then probably take some</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride to help you</p>
<p>acidify that stomach but what happens is</p>
<p>that even if you take a probiotic if you</p>
<p>took sauerkraut what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is that might create more bloating if</p>
<p>you truly have sibo</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to um do that</p>
<p>fasting and do do basically some protein</p>
<p>foods make sure they&rsquo;re like the fish or</p>
<p>seafood or maybe some eggs and uh maybe</p>
<p>even some organ meats and and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>way to do it healthily until that gets</p>
<p>cleared out for a couple months and then</p>
<p>you can start slowly adding in some</p>
<p>Fiber once the microbes are in the gut</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you need them but it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing the other thing with</p>
<p>this fibromyalgia which I&rsquo;ll be doing a</p>
<p>video on a lot of times fibromyalgia</p>
<p>chronic fatigue syndrome fatigue is</p>
<p>coming from an Epstein-Barr virus which</p>
<p>is in the family of the herpes viruses</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s coming out of remission</p>
<p>because you are under some stress that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t seem to kind of fully resolve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really big factor which people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>this virus like 95 of the population has</p>
<p>it it comes out it kicks you when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>down and it can put you in a state of uh</p>
<p>kind of funkiness brain fog and fatigue</p>
<p>and I Don&rsquo;t Care What vitamin you take</p>
<p>what diet you do it&rsquo;s not going to work</p>
<p>unless that stress is really confronted</p>
<p>and handled to the point where</p>
<p>um you know you fully resolve it so for</p>
<p>example if you&rsquo;re I don&rsquo;t know if your</p>
<p>neighbor is a terrorist okay and uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re under a lot of stress because of</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to have to move I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so these are just things that you&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck between Rockets exactly you</p>
<p>have to handle it so go ahead sorry</p>
<p>uh my stress the stress is well managed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking olive leaf extract</p>
<p>for fibromyalgia I&rsquo;m also taking</p>
<p>um a lot of digestive formula of yours</p>
<p>forbidden hydrochloride and ACV</p>
<p>so um and I&rsquo;m playing sequel for energy</p>
<p>oregano oil black garlic gallbladder</p>
<p>formula cod liver oil</p>
<p>electrolytes wheat grass juice powder</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking it all</p>
<p>yeah I think the problem is is the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just um you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>avoid fiber you&rsquo;re going to avoid</p>
<p>any and all</p>
<p>um things that can ferment</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re gonna have to do more</p>
<p>carnivore uh for a couple months I think</p>
<p>that will be</p>
<p>the key to your success</p>
<p>uh test it out let&rsquo;s see if my theory is</p>
<p>right come back uh in a couple weeks and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to be a solution</p>
<p>for you arshita thanks so much for</p>
<p>coming along with us we really</p>
<p>appreciate it and look forward to you</p>
<p>coming back on here and let us know</p>
<p>about all your great progress okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hit it with another question Dr Berg a</p>
<p>true falser</p>
<p>all right so true or false adult</p>
<p>broccoli has more nutrients than the</p>
<p>baby AKA sprouted broccoli</p>
<p>All Right audience rip through that one</p>
<p>and why don&rsquo;t we go back to social media</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even pronounce that but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to try it anyway not from Facebook</p>
<p>can you share your thoughts on in m in</p>
<p>nicotinamide uh oh good mononucleotide</p>
<p>seems like a vital factor in promoting</p>
<p>longevity</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to as I&rsquo;m trying to explain</p>
<p>this I&rsquo;m trying to keep it really simple</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s involved in the</p>
<p>mitochondria it&rsquo;s a pathway involved in</p>
<p>there to help you make energy and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>product that a lot of people take for</p>
<p>energy and it&rsquo;s just the reason they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk too much about it even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great product and it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>anti-aging is that</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want people to say oh he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s recommending another pill I</p>
<p>have to take but I like I like it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it helps to um especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting older</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s we kind of run out of it and it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s directly involved in producing</p>
<p>energy now</p>
<p>some people say you know wow I feel like</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>I just had some caffeine but without the</p>
<p>Jitters you know and this type of thing</p>
<p>but it also helps people sleep too</p>
<p>believe it or not so it takes energy to</p>
<p>sleep so some people take it right</p>
<p>before bed and they sleep better but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s mainly um in the in the</p>
<p>family of like an anti-aging supplement</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s several different</p>
<p>um forms of that and you can</p>
<p>experiment with it um but it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>definitely we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll I think help your</p>
<p>energy and help with longevity and your</p>
<p>sleep and just quality of the the</p>
<p>mitochondria support</p>
<p>um but I try to say this without without</p>
<p>giving you additional Mis big words</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a little complex when</p>
<p>you start getting into that topic okay</p>
<p>very good let&rsquo;s clean up the Green Room</p>
<p>last but not least is Scott right here</p>
<p>from uh the United States from Loveland</p>
<p>Colorado a nice nice place and Scott if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unmuted you are on with Dr Burr</p>
<p>go ahead with your question please sweet</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg I want to start off</p>
<p>by saying thank you for helping me lose</p>
<p>uh 40 pounds on keto on the weekdays and</p>
<p>helping with my tachycardia uh my</p>
<p>question today is uh how many</p>
<p>supplements is too many supplements for</p>
<p>background I&rsquo;ve been having around 12 15</p>
<p>vitamin pills I&rsquo;m currently working on</p>
<p>omad doing meals such as five Eggs three</p>
<p>cups of rice cauliflower with olive oil</p>
<p>some tablespoons of MCT oil but want to</p>
<p>make sure I&rsquo;m getting enough vitamins</p>
<p>and minerals when doing a longer fast</p>
<p>for say 48 72 hours plus or when I want</p>
<p>to go to the workout at the gym that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not starving myself but getting what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>needed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to try to keep it really</p>
<p>short good luck with myself but</p>
<p>um the one of the you know some people</p>
<p>say well you don&rsquo;t need any supplements</p>
<p>well this is where you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>the food to give you the supplements</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the difficult part that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the reasons why I want to create um a</p>
<p>channel to kind of even grow your own</p>
<p>food so you can get more nutrients and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not dependent on taking a lot of</p>
<p>these supplements</p>
<p>um the way they teach you</p>
<p>um in school of how to recommend</p>
<p>supplements in the natural uh</p>
<p>alternative</p>
<p>field when you go to these postgraduate</p>
<p>seminars and things is that</p>
<p>oh just take the list of symptoms that a</p>
<p>person has and match the different</p>
<p>remedy to the symptom I don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that that&rsquo;s not true about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re treating symptoms again</p>
<p>but at least there&rsquo;s less side effects</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true so there are a million</p>
<p>different supplements for fatigue or</p>
<p>inflammation or blood sugar problems</p>
<p>right so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>my whole thing is like um</p>
<p>what really is that one thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating the majority of the problem and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s support that let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s just take</p>
<p>an average person I think that one thing</p>
<p>for a lot of people but not everyone is</p>
<p>the insulin resistance</p>
<p>so what what&rsquo;s going to replace support</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>way more important than supplements are</p>
<p>the diet the basic diet get unhealthy</p>
<p>keto and get on intermittent fasting</p>
<p>okay so now there are some basic things</p>
<p>when you do that you need a little more</p>
<p>electrolytes B vitamins trace minerals</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>this is the key things uh can you get</p>
<p>enough Sun nowadays no not in the winter</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to take vitamin D</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t get that from food</p>
<p>um but then we have other factors that</p>
<p>so many people have a lot of</p>
<p>inflammation in the body because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been eating at the grocery store a lot</p>
<p>of omega-6 oils since soy oils and corn</p>
<p>oil and stuff like that so they need</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids uh so we have that</p>
<p>factor and then um</p>
<p>and then one day Dr Burks talks about uh</p>
<p>the DNA and you get your DNA tested</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh I have problems</p>
<p>with these genes that I can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>absorb B12 or choline oh I need those</p>
<p>now so unfortunately yes um I think um</p>
<p>an average person is going to need a</p>
<p>good handful of supplements but the goal</p>
<p>over</p>
<p>long term is to</p>
<p>be able to eat food that gives you these</p>
<p>supplements and um</p>
<p>but then again I have a very difficult</p>
<p>time finding</p>
<p>um people to work with that are going to</p>
<p>stay clean long enough to do that in you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s a lot of factors involved I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m just trying to help people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>maximize their health and eat the right</p>
<p>things but not everyone for some strange</p>
<p>reason will be perfect</p>
<p>um I won&rsquo;t mention any name Steve but uh</p>
<p>um sometimes it&rsquo;s you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of doing it right you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>need more supplements</p>
<p>um if your history has been really bad</p>
<p>with Foods you&rsquo;re going to need more</p>
<p>supplements and depending on your</p>
<p>genetics you might a little bit more but</p>
<p>ideally it shouldn&rsquo;t be hundreds of</p>
<p>pills it should be maybe a small amount</p>
<p>on a regular basis and then over time</p>
<p>you just kind of start to wean off that</p>
<p>sorry I recrofit photo to show what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here and I do want to say I</p>
<p>recognize hey wow I recognize</p>
<p>electrolyte there it is back there and</p>
<p>also your d3k2 is featured there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple other poisonous products I only</p>
<p>say that because they&rsquo;re not yours look</p>
<p>at that</p>
<p>yeah I I hear you and it&rsquo;s um sometimes</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ll have to do more videos on</p>
<p>that because I think there&rsquo;s a lot to</p>
<p>talk about that how do you wean down to</p>
<p>the stuff you really need and not take</p>
<p>extra stuff uh honestly if you saw my</p>
<p>house</p>
<p>um I would put that to shame because I</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>pretty much everything everything you</p>
<p>could possibly I have like a warehouse</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding and I have</p>
<p>um just a lot of stuff because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always experimenting I&rsquo;m trying this and</p>
<p>that so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff I don&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>people like well that didn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna even mention it I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>recommend something that actually even</p>
<p>made me worse or something like that but</p>
<p>I I think it&rsquo;s a you just kind of gave</p>
<p>me a good idea for another video I think</p>
<p>an important one because</p>
<p>yeah we don&rsquo;t want to get caught up into</p>
<p>the treating of the symptoms but looks</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve taken some good stuff there</p>
<p>is indeed thank you so much Scott we</p>
<p>appreciate it uh we&rsquo;re kind of running</p>
<p>out of time here so let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>last quiz question uh true false adult</p>
<p>adult broccoli has more nutrients than</p>
<p>baby uh AKA sprouted broccoli and the</p>
<p>audience has an opinion as usual 95</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s false and five percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;m worried about the five</p>
<p>percent</p>
<p>you should be worried about five percent</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely uh</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s the broccoli Sprouts that have</p>
<p>more nutrition especially in the area of</p>
<p>the phytonutrients because this little</p>
<p>baby plant that&rsquo;s developing needs extra</p>
<p>things to get it to survive so that seed</p>
<p>releases some</p>
<p>amazing things to to help it do that and</p>
<p>as the plant gets older</p>
<p>those phytonutrients go lower and lower</p>
<p>and lower I&rsquo;m talking like by a factor</p>
<p>of 50 to 100 times more sulforaphane</p>
<p>which is a</p>
<p>you know Hopkins tried to get the</p>
<p>universe the patents on that because</p>
<p>they found that it&rsquo;s great as an</p>
<p>anti-cancer</p>
<p>but um and also it&rsquo;ll actually put H</p>
<p>pylori in remission believe it or not</p>
<p>and it does a lot of other things so</p>
<p>um the broccoli sprouts and the micro</p>
<p>greens</p>
<p>Michael do you know what I like</p>
<p>microgreens even better than Sprouts is</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>well if they&rsquo;re grown on soil because</p>
<p>you get the benefit of the microbes and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important we&rsquo;re Sprouts you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really use soil so</p>
<p>um you get an extra boost of microbes</p>
<p>with those microgreens</p>
<p>um no I&rsquo;m not most of them though are</p>
<p>made hydroponically which I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that but uh</p>
<p>anyway we&rsquo;ll talk more about that in the</p>
<p>upcoming</p>
<p>new channel that I&rsquo;m going to create on</p>
<p>growing which I have a lot to talk about</p>
<p>okay very good and if I&rsquo;m my doctor a</p>
<p>burke I want to remind everybody to</p>
<p>download the great Dr Burke app it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free it&rsquo;s available on both the Apple</p>
<p>and Android devices so get that and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have a bunch of knowledge in the</p>
<p>palm of your hand also Dr Berg I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s any new word on how</p>
<p>people all around the world can get your</p>
<p>great products but I know you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on that and trying to make them</p>
<p>available uh in different places other</p>
<p>than the contiguous U.S</p>
<p>yeah so we will be doing that we&rsquo;ll also</p>
<p>be teaching people uh giving him tips on</p>
<p>uh I think a shift to Growing your own</p>
<p>food is going to be smart</p>
<p>um because then you can control it and I</p>
<p>have some</p>
<p>incredible information from these</p>
<p>Farmers especially on how you can do it</p>
<p>in a real simple way I&rsquo;m really into</p>
<p>Simplicity right inside on your</p>
<p>windowsill and you could you could have</p>
<p>uh growing things and then make your</p>
<p>putting your salad in there and you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be awesome because uh you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to grow it and have your kids be</p>
<p>involved and it&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun and I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s going to be the wave of the</p>
<p>future</p>
<p>um I also experimented with aeroponic</p>
<p>and hydroponic I have a lot of units</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to recommend that</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m not excited about that I</p>
<p>mean in a pinch it&rsquo;s better than nothing</p>
<p>but you know going back to real just</p>
<p>soil that&rsquo;s always the best but we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>talk about how to also grow your own</p>
<p>soil keep it simple so you can have your</p>
<p>garden too but I I can imagine all</p>
<p>winter long you should be</p>
<p>on your windowsills just be growing your</p>
<p>own your salads and uh</p>
<p>um or micro greens especially and that</p>
<p>would be like a really healthy thing to</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>and on that note Steve</p>
<p>um again I just want to thank everyone</p>
<p>for your wonderful comments and great um</p>
<p>discussions on the YouTube channel and</p>
<p>your attention watching this this far I</p>
<p>appreciate that</p>
<p>um stay tuned for some more content next</p>
<p>week and as well as uh we&rsquo;ll catch back</p>
<p>up next Friday morning at uh same time</p>
<p>11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning a.m Eastern</p>
<p>Standard Time</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
