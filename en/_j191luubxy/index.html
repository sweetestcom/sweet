Burke at eight six</p><p>six five six one four two nine two and</p><p>now dr. Eric Burke</p><p>hey guys I&rsquo;m back again it&rsquo;s Friday</p><p>morning at 9:00 I&rsquo;m here to answer your</p><p>questions if you want to know the number</p><p>if you want to call in its eight six six</p><p>five six one four two nine two so we</p><p>should be on Facebook</p><p>we&rsquo;re also on YouTube and so call in and</p><p>if you have a burning question let&rsquo;s go</p><p>ahead and answer it</p><p>okay so Alejandro from Michigan you are</p><p>first up do you have a question about</p><p>Quito hey dr. Berg hi could taking my</p><p>phone call sure what do you recommend</p><p>for people experiencing heart</p><p>palpitations on keto or intermittent</p><p>intermittent fasting I increased my</p><p>magnesium sodium and potassium a bit but</p><p>palpitations are so present I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>if I should increase them even more or</p><p>if there are other vitamins or minerals</p><p>that I should be taking in addition to</p><p>these and as far as the palpitations I</p><p>feel them even more when I slouch</p><p>forward or when I lay down perhaps you</p><p>can even do a video on this as well</p><p>because uh seems like a lot of people</p><p>who are on keto experienced them as well</p><p>so I don&rsquo;t know what do you recommend</p><p>it&rsquo;s a really good question are you</p><p>doing in a minute fasting yeah okay and</p><p>how many cups of vegetables are you</p><p>consuming I mean I usually have like a</p><p>salad that consists of just spinach and</p><p>um like an avocado</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really count I just have like a</p><p>big salad okay do you before you started</p><p>doing the keto did you do the All</p><p>American diet where you&rsquo;re you know</p><p>eating you know carbs and sugar yeah</p><p>okay yeah have you just started the kita</p><p>um a little over a month ago okay cool</p><p>so let&rsquo;s just talk about that when you</p><p>do a keto what happens is that you&rsquo;re</p><p>really correcting something called</p><p>insulin resistance and you&rsquo;re actually</p><p>switching your body from sugar burning</p><p>to fat-burning over here and have some</p><p>little thuds in my nose and then you</p><p>have a situation where you&rsquo;re utilizing</p><p>different nutrients more B vitamins and</p><p>definitely more</p><p>minerals and potassium things like that</p><p>so usually palpitations atrial</p><p>fibrillation heart arrhythmias</p><p>that&rsquo;s all electrical issues to the</p><p>heart and that those electrical issues</p><p>are controlled by minerals typically and</p><p>you&rsquo;re probably because you&rsquo;re switching</p><p>over you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re demanding more</p><p>potassium that&rsquo;s the first one that pops</p><p>up I would start counting the serving</p><p>sizes of vegetables that you could or</p><p>the cups of vegetables that you have and</p><p>start having more and more and more I</p><p>would also have something called the</p><p>electrolyte powder which gives you a lot</p><p>of potassium and magnesium and these are</p><p>the minerals and electrolytes that go</p><p>right in like a rocket ship and do that</p><p>until they go away but here&rsquo;s that</p><p>here&rsquo;s the tricky part when you measures</p><p>these electrolytes especially like</p><p>potassium for example and you do a blood</p><p>test it usually comes out normal because</p><p>only 2% of your body protects body&rsquo;s</p><p>potassium is inside the blood 98% of</p><p>it&rsquo;s inside the cell so you would have</p><p>to really do what&rsquo;s called an</p><p>intracellular potassium test which you</p><p>have to know about and request that and</p><p>you know you might have to get a scrape</p><p>of inside of your mouth and send it off</p><p>to a lab yourself because a lot of times</p><p>doctors don&rsquo;t look at that that will</p><p>really tell you the true findings of</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on with your potassium but</p><p>just from what I know I think adding</p><p>more potassium would help from</p><p>electrolyte mix until they chill out and</p><p>then adding more vegetables now let&rsquo;s</p><p>say for example you do all that and it</p><p>still doesn&rsquo;t work there&rsquo;s another</p><p>source of palpitations and that would be</p><p>the gallbladder and especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>laying on your maybe you let&rsquo;s say your</p><p>gall bladders congest or something you</p><p>lay on one side or the other you lay</p><p>down it can the way the diaphragm is</p><p>oriented to your gall bladder could</p><p>cause a little bit of a congestion and</p><p>that pressure backs up into the liver</p><p>which is right connected to your heart</p><p>so there&rsquo;s some congestion with or</p><p>bloating it can press in the heart and</p><p>create some heart issues just from that</p><p>angle too</p><p>so I do know there is a connection</p><p>between the gallbladder and the</p><p>palpitations so so you might need to</p><p>adjust what you&rsquo;re eating and maybe have</p><p>some more some help with digestion to</p><p>see if it&rsquo;s digestive related or just an</p><p>electrolyte issue but I think I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>do a video on that because I think</p><p>there&rsquo;s a little I can probably do a</p><p>whole like seminar on that but I think I</p><p>you know that&rsquo;s just some tips that you</p><p>can focus on right now</p><p>thanks hey crystal you are on the air</p><p>from Wake Forest now North Carolina go</p><p>ahead you had a question</p><p>hello how are you hi great thanks but my</p><p>question is in regards to your serving</p><p>sizes or your serving size or cups or</p><p>the vegetables or salad</p><p>so when you say 7 cups is that is that</p><p>the same across the board whether it&rsquo;s</p><p>just salad or whatever type of vegetable</p><p>or is it is it specifically salad good</p><p>question and I probably didn&rsquo;t emphasize</p><p>this enough in some of the videos but a</p><p>serving size of vegetable is really one</p><p>cup a serving size of salad is really</p><p>two cups yeah because it&rsquo;s a fluffier I</p><p>mean I have a hard time getting people</p><p>to consume even seven cups of salad so</p><p>if I were to really tell them actually</p><p>you need seven serving size which is 14</p><p>cups they probably freak out so I&rsquo;m not</p><p>going to even say that so I want to just</p><p>go let&rsquo;s go to step one you know just</p><p>get a big salad and your diet you know</p><p>ideally two maybe more but yeah so a</p><p>serving size of vegetables is one cup a</p><p>serving size of salad is two cups and I</p><p>think you know cuz it&rsquo;s just the density</p><p>I think if you start also if you wanted</p><p>to if you consume just vegetables you</p><p>probably wouldn&rsquo;t need as much a salad</p><p>so to see five cups of vegetables that</p><p>would be like ten well no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p><p>actually five cups would be equivalent</p><p>to probably the same as ten cups of</p><p>salad so you can kind of</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t like vegetables just</p><p>consume more dense vegetables and you</p><p>could probably get away with you know</p><p>having the least amount salad is it&rsquo;s</p><p>easy to consume so that&rsquo;s one thing and</p><p>then you can do the Cal State of course</p><p>now the other thing you want to add as</p><p>well is some of the fermented vegetables</p><p>like sauerkraut for example if you did</p><p>one cup of sauerkraut you get a lot of</p><p>benefits from the nutrients that are</p><p>made from the microbes and that&rsquo;s</p><p>probiotics</p><p>that&rsquo;s lactic acid and it&rsquo;s also vitamin</p><p>C I recently did analysis on my</p><p>wheatgrass juice and I was literally</p><p>shocked to find out I have some serious</p><p>amounts of b12 in that wheatgrass juice</p><p>which first of all the normal RDAs for</p><p>b12 are roughly around I think it&rsquo;s like</p><p>two point five micrograms this had like</p><p>five points something micrograms and I&rsquo;m</p><p>like how can this be</p><p>because there is no b12 a wheatgrass</p><p>it&rsquo;s produced by the friendly bacteria</p><p>that was living on that wheatgrass when</p><p>it was processed so we get the benefit</p><p>of these microbes making vitamins which</p><p>is awesome so the my beach well now I</p><p>could say my my wheatgrass has be 12 but</p><p>yeah the fermented vegetables are really</p><p>important okay Paris you&rsquo;re from</p><p>California you had a question about the</p><p>keto diet and I guess not you know some</p><p>nausea tell me about that I&rsquo;m feeling</p><p>nauseated and I crave like a lemon and I</p><p>need a lots of lemon and you know apple</p><p>cider</p><p>I think potassium electrolyte you know</p><p>all those things but recently I feel</p><p>like who knows you did I&rsquo;m having to eat</p><p>because I know that&rsquo;s going to happen</p><p>after eating so I don&rsquo;t know what should</p><p>I do and sometimes I crave like little</p><p>bread</p><p>first first of all do you still have a</p><p>belly do you have any belly fat no no</p><p>okay good</p><p>do you have a kiss do you have any type</p><p>of a history of eating a lot of sugary</p><p>carbohydrates in the past yes okay how</p><p>long have you been on the keto seven</p><p>month seven months okay do you do you do</p><p>intermittent fasting yes okay how many</p><p>meals are you doing sometimes one</p><p>sometimes two okay okay good so I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna I&rsquo;m gonna click it so I can just</p><p>talk and then you can hear me but you</p><p>can&rsquo;t say anything if you crave a lemon</p><p>that&rsquo;s usually a choline deficiency</p><p>choline is needed to strip off that off</p><p>the liver I&rsquo;m not saying you have a</p><p>fatty liver but it&rsquo;s one possibility and</p><p>that can be causing the congestion in</p><p>the gallbladder so nausea is really a</p><p>gallbladder issue that could be backed</p><p>up from the liver being fatty and that&rsquo;s</p><p>probably why you&rsquo;re craving the lemon</p><p>because lemon is kind of like it&rsquo;s a</p><p>very sour thing that that basically will</p><p>cause a nice effect on stripping off fat</p><p>off the liver it&rsquo;s kind of a lip</p><p>atrophic and it has choline in it which</p><p>actually leave it out if you just bought</p><p>choline and a powder and you mix it in a</p><p>drink you probably would benefit even</p><p>more than consuming lemons because that</p><p>that has direct effect on stripping off</p><p>off the liver especially if you crave it</p><p>if people crave sour things that usually</p><p>are choline deficient and choline is a</p><p>great fat dissolving thing for a fatty</p><p>liver and I&rsquo;ve seen like fast results</p><p>with that it&rsquo;s stripping off out the</p><p>liver now the other thing is that when</p><p>you start doing the keto and you&rsquo;re if</p><p>you did it for seven months and you&rsquo;re</p><p>losing a lot of weight all the fats that</p><p>the body has to come through the liver</p><p>and come out of the gallbladder so there</p><p>could be some congestion with that or</p><p>you didn&rsquo;t need for fat in the diet is</p><p>probably going down because you&rsquo;re you</p><p>in your own fat in which case I would</p><p>adjust the amount of fat that you</p><p>consume to the point where that all the</p><p>nausea goes away because that&rsquo;s really</p><p>probably what&rsquo;s behind it so you&rsquo;re you</p><p>probably need one meal and then it&rsquo;ll</p><p>just a little bit of that and I think</p><p>you&rsquo;ll be fine but I do understand that</p><p>nausea because it really really has to</p><p>do with here you are you&rsquo;re switched</p><p>over you&rsquo;re eating like one or two meals</p><p>a day you&rsquo;re processing a lot of fats</p><p>you&rsquo;re running on fats and you have to</p><p>have a really good gallbladder to</p><p>process all this thing so it&rsquo;s kind of a</p><p>new thing or else you kind of backs up</p><p>and you feel kind of funky so you want</p><p>to increase your vegetables increase the</p><p>acidifier episode of vinegar choline</p><p>kale shakes less fat and maybe do some</p><p>acupressure to the gallbladder maybe</p><p>even the gall better formula I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s going to handle it and then if</p><p>that still doesn&rsquo;t handle it go get an</p><p>ultrasound of the liver to see if there</p><p>is a fatty liver and the skin they can</p><p>scan right over the gallbladder see</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on and I would kind of</p><p>investigate that all right</p><p>great question you gave me another idea</p><p>for a video all right hey Laura you&rsquo;re</p><p>from New York you had a question about</p><p>bladder infections yes I do I first of</p><p>all I want to thank you for sharing with</p><p>so many people you have such a gift um</p><p>I&rsquo;m 62 I&rsquo;m 62 years old and I have</p><p>repeatedly have bladder infections and</p><p>I&rsquo;m very clean and it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>complicated by the fact that I find that</p><p>citrus aggravates this rather than what</p><p>most people think makes it better and I</p><p>don&rsquo;t really know what to do okay do you</p><p>have you been doing keto intermittent</p><p>fasting no I don&rsquo;t I have to say I&rsquo;ve</p><p>kind of just started with your program</p><p>and I&rsquo;m taking the you know the a lot of</p><p>your pills</p><p>taking the adrenals and I&rsquo;m started with</p><p>that okay and the wheatgrass I also take</p><p>okay great now here&rsquo;s the next question</p><p>do you know for a fact that you have a</p><p>bladder infection because you tested it</p><p>and you have high white blood cells</p><p>or are you just having some of the</p><p>symptoms no I&rsquo;m actually I&rsquo;m having a</p><p>urine culture that&rsquo;s telling me I have</p><p>an infection and I need the antibiotic</p><p>and then I take it and I get retested</p><p>and it&rsquo;s I never get a totally clear</p><p>result but the infection is basically</p><p>gone and I take probiotics and I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know what else to do</p><p>have you have you had a lot of UTIs in</p><p>the past yes I had them when I was very</p><p>young and then I stopped and now I&rsquo;m</p><p>getting them much more frequently and I</p><p>was even hospitalized once for it</p><p>because they couldn&rsquo;t get the infection</p><p>under control okay but that was a you</p><p>know a couple of years ago but now I</p><p>just get them maybe three or four times</p><p>a year okay all right so let me just</p><p>cover that I did a video on that you</p><p>should check it out there&rsquo;s a remedy</p><p>there I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s gonna be the</p><p>long-term solution for you might be a</p><p>short-term solution you want to kind of</p><p>look at the whole picture I dunno</p><p>once you start doing the keto and</p><p>especially in a minute fasting together</p><p>and do it like I I instruct people I</p><p>really think your bladder infections are</p><p>going to go way down and of course I</p><p>forgot to give it a disclaimer to</p><p>everyone every all the information I&rsquo;m</p><p>telling you is not meant to diagnose you</p><p>were give you any treatments for medical</p><p>diseases so this is just for your</p><p>entertainment okay</p><p>okay coming right back to the bladder</p><p>question I think what happens when you</p><p>start running your body on ketones and</p><p>off the sugar which the bacteria live on</p><p>and love the chance of getting</p><p>infections or the rate of get infections</p><p>go way way way way down because these</p><p>bacteria especially in the bladder love</p><p>sugar they love it so right there that&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna actually reduce everything and the</p><p>pH is going to change within your urine</p><p>to the point where you&rsquo;re going to make</p><p>an environment in your bladder that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to be very very hard for those</p><p>microbes to live I think every single</p><p>day you should be consuming a good</p><p>amount of fermented vegetable sauerkraut</p><p>that would be really important you mean</p><p>need to be doing the outside</p><p>and then get right on the Aikido and the</p><p>internment fasting and that&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>eventually clear things up to the point</p><p>where it&rsquo;s stable and you don&rsquo;t keep</p><p>getting him over and over and over again</p><p>okay so go ahead and do that and let us</p><p>know how you do okay good question</p><p>though hey David you had a question from</p><p>Texas blood work you had some blood work</p><p>done yes I&rsquo;m trying to find out whether</p><p>or not it&rsquo;s normal when you&rsquo;re losing a</p><p>lot of weight from lab work to lab work</p><p>for your numbers to go up cholesterol</p><p>goes up in triglycerides go up and I had</p><p>one other question that I want to ask a</p><p>quick about your new style of kal steak</p><p>so those are a bunch of questions okay</p><p>good</p><p>let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s ask about the new style</p><p>of Koscheck are you talking about the</p><p>one that you&rsquo;re making in the blender or</p><p>the one that you had mentioned with your</p><p>last Skype interview that you&rsquo;re</p><p>starting to add coconut oil</p><p>what good great yeah so let&rsquo;s talk about</p><p>that one first so the coconut oil</p><p>actually adds some fat to your Cal shake</p><p>just like you would add oil olive oil to</p><p>a salad when you add fat there&rsquo;s certain</p><p>things in the salad and this is people</p><p>don&rsquo;t realize that people think that the</p><p>vitamins the nutrients in salad and</p><p>vegetables are purely water-soluble a</p><p>lot of Amar but some aren&rsquo;t especially</p><p>the carotenoids those are all like pre</p><p>vitamin E those are fat soluble so if</p><p>you add a little coconut oil you&rsquo;ll</p><p>start extracting more carotenoids now</p><p>there&rsquo;s over 600 different carotenoids</p><p>lutein lutein is one of them and there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of other ones which are really</p><p>necessary for the vision and the brain</p><p>not to mention the prostate and a lot of</p><p>other things so you can extract more of</p><p>these nutrients out of your vegetables</p><p>and kale if you add a little coconut oil</p><p>just like a teaspoon and you&rsquo;ll be fine</p><p>so that&rsquo;s just something new that I</p><p>started doing and I&rsquo;m seeing the</p><p>benefits and I highly recommend it now</p><p>the other question is with your</p><p>bloodwork yes you are going to see</p><p>cholesterol going up simply because</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually losing fat from your fat</p><p>cells and if you look at what is in a</p><p>fat cell</p><p>triglycerides and cholesterol that&rsquo;s</p><p>what&rsquo;s in your fat cell so how is it</p><p>going to come out it has to come out</p><p>through the tube it&rsquo;s going to come out</p><p>through the liver it&rsquo;s going to come out</p><p>to the blood and it&rsquo;s going to come out</p><p>to your digestive system and so yes it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to increase because you&rsquo;re</p><p>mobilizing your fat but then it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to come down as long as you&rsquo;re not</p><p>eating the sugar and you do this over a</p><p>period of a time you&rsquo;re gonna see it</p><p>it&rsquo;s gonna come up and it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>come down so you really want to watch</p><p>those four videos that I have on</p><p>cholesterol and LDL to really understand</p><p>the picture because I spent a long time</p><p>to try to consolidate even one of the</p><p>videos I think was video four I spent</p><p>like at least twelve hours preparing for</p><p>that one video to consolidate the</p><p>information so you can get it in easy</p><p>chunks because in order to explain</p><p>something you have to understand it very</p><p>well and be able to give the simple</p><p>version of it and that&rsquo;s what I did so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would do and let&rsquo;s say for</p><p>example you do that over a longer period</p><p>of time and it&rsquo;s still not coming down</p><p>there&rsquo;s a rare chance that you might</p><p>have a genetic cholesterol issue and if</p><p>that&rsquo;s the case then you need to modify</p><p>it a little bit but still I have people</p><p>with genetic issues that eventually</p><p>bring it down by doing keto nm and a</p><p>fasting so new triglycerides are</p><p>probably the most important thing to</p><p>judge everything by because that&rsquo;s like</p><p>once you run through that and you do a</p><p>little carb those should come down</p><p>alright another good question dear hey</p><p>Bill you&rsquo;re from Vermont go ahead a</p><p>question my question is hypothetically</p><p>if you had high ocular pressure how</p><p>would you take that</p><p>you mean the how would I take the AC</p><p>carmine yeah oh right right okay so let</p><p>me answer that question there&rsquo;s a</p><p>product there&rsquo;s a company called</p><p>standard process and I personally I&rsquo;m</p><p>not using it now because I don&rsquo;t have my</p><p>clinic that&rsquo;s usually a product that</p><p>would get if you had a clinic and you&rsquo;re</p><p>working with patients one in one it&rsquo;s</p><p>not really an online thing however you</p><p>can find a lot of their products online</p><p>it&rsquo;s a great company have been do their</p><p>the farm where they grow their all their</p><p>food six times it&rsquo;s right in Palmyra</p><p>Wisconsin about an hour hour away from</p><p>where I grew up so I really love that</p><p>company and they have a product called</p><p>AC carbamide which is carbamide is kind</p><p>of a filtered version of urea and they</p><p>urea is a very permeable substance and</p><p>it&rsquo;s used in a lot of skin creams and</p><p>and even supplements but that one I</p><p>would take three times a day to help</p><p>increase the fluid that&rsquo;s being</p><p>exchanged out of the eye so a seeker of</p><p>mine is there you&rsquo;re not going to find a</p><p>lot of research simply because you can&rsquo;t</p><p>make claims with a lot of nutritional</p><p>products so there&rsquo;s no one out there</p><p>that&rsquo;s going to start talking about what</p><p>it really does simply because if you&rsquo;re</p><p>selling it and you&rsquo;re making a claim</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna get in trouble so I know I</p><p>can make a claim because I&rsquo;m not selling</p><p>it you can go get it somewhere so that&rsquo;s</p><p>really why you&rsquo;re not seeing a lot of</p><p>stuff out there but the whole thing with</p><p>me is I like try it out see if it works</p><p>for you that way I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna cure you you know but I&rsquo;ve seen</p><p>some good results with a lot of other</p><p>people in addition to the same start</p><p>time start doing you know the eating</p><p>plan that you need to do to ultimately</p><p>correct it because the a seeker of mind</p><p>is really a kind of a temporary fix</p><p>until you can really clean up the deeper</p><p>issues but if you just look up the data</p><p>in Glu coma you&rsquo;re not gonna find any</p><p>lot of great stuff medically either I</p><p>mean there&rsquo;s really they don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>lot of solutions they don&rsquo;t know what</p><p>the cause is so that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>run into to so it&rsquo;s a big old mystery</p><p>but if you just go with the natural way</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna find some great great</p><p>changes especially with AC carbamide and</p><p>not see any side effects that i i&rsquo;ve</p><p>ever seen but it&rsquo;s good for the kidney</p><p>as well thanks Bill hey Debbie you had a</p><p>question about insulin you&rsquo;re from New</p><p>Jersey go ahead</p><p>I have an adrenal body type so I am</p><p>overweight and I hold belly fat and I am</p><p>a type 2 diabetic that&rsquo;s insulin</p><p>resistant last year when I was had my</p><p>blood work done my a1c was 12 so what</p><p>they did was they put me on long-acting</p><p>insulin and after watching all of your</p><p>videos and everything I decided to go</p><p>keto at the beginning of September I</p><p>understand everything that I have to do</p><p>and my blood Sugar&rsquo;s reacted beautifully</p><p>at first they dropped down 87 to 120 it</p><p>was amazing and then I got a little</p><p>nervous that they were so low so I</p><p>dropped my insulin because I figured</p><p>that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to work but</p><p>once I did that everything spiked back</p><p>up and now no matter what I do it stays</p><p>between 130 and 180 no matter how I eat</p><p>so my first I and carbs I&rsquo;m so sensitive</p><p>I can&rsquo;t even have like a section of an</p><p>orange it&rsquo;ll just spike so my first</p><p>question is how do you possibly lose</p><p>weight when long-acting insulin is in</p><p>your body because my understanding is if</p><p>insulins presents fat can burn and the</p><p>second one is if I&rsquo;m doing the keto and</p><p>the and the intermittent fasting</p><p>I guess keto bombs are out unless you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating them with your meal mm-hmm very</p><p>good questions the question I have for</p><p>you how long have you been a diabetic</p><p>technically I mean well I was probably</p><p>diagnosed about 20 years ago so I if</p><p>they started with metformin and then</p><p>they added II and and what my numbers</p><p>were like in the six is the seventh and</p><p>then all of a sudden it just everything</p><p>got out of control jump to a twelve</p><p>that&rsquo;s why they put me on insulin okay</p><p>so there&rsquo;s one test that I would get</p><p>tabbing and it&rsquo;s called a fasting</p><p>insulin test have you ever taken that</p><p>before I think so it&rsquo;s where you go in</p><p>and they took a five or six hour test</p><p>right yeah yeah okay it&rsquo;s def is</p><p>different than the fasting blood sugar</p><p>it&rsquo;s a fasting insulin test right it</p><p>would be very interesting to see what&rsquo;s</p><p>happening to your insulin ones fasting</p><p>because here they&rsquo;re giving you your</p><p>type - right which type - typically has</p><p>too much insulin right that&rsquo;s what it is</p><p>so now now they put you on insulin so</p><p>why would they put you on the insulin</p><p>obviously it&rsquo;s probably too low so you</p><p>could be going over to a type</p><p>and not even knowing you know and that&rsquo;s</p><p>just my that&rsquo;s my thought on that so I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna put you on hold you can still hear</p><p>me but I I I can&rsquo;t hear you but let me</p><p>just talk about this because this is</p><p>important you started September I guess</p><p>that would be of this like this month</p><p>beginning this month so it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna take some time it&rsquo;s going to take</p><p>a good amount of time if you&rsquo;re a</p><p>diabetic for 20 years and you&rsquo;re on</p><p>insulin</p><p>you&rsquo;re at a stage where it&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>awhile I would stick to it and I would</p><p>approach this as a pilot program where</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna go really slow on the you</p><p>know get with your doctor and make you</p><p>know work with them to adjust the dosage</p><p>but you the dosage needs to be adjusted</p><p>so low that so gradually over time so</p><p>your body can start to heal and and fix</p><p>it because really ultimately what we</p><p>want to do is fix the insulin resistance</p><p>so now the need for insulin goes down so</p><p>you can take less and less insulin the</p><p>fact that you went in this program and</p><p>you had great change means you need to</p><p>go in this program but it&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>awhile to heal this situation so of</p><p>course I have a lot of videos and</p><p>insulin resistance you&rsquo;re going to have</p><p>to be probably adding supplements and</p><p>getting the eating and doing the</p><p>intermittent fasting Nikaido bombs must</p><p>be consumed with a meal if you have a</p><p>hard time with that that just tells us</p><p>that you&rsquo;re really insulin resistance</p><p>because you can&rsquo;t go from one meal to</p><p>the next but yeah the goal is to get you</p><p>off of the insulin that&rsquo;s our first goal</p><p>okay and that could take months it could</p><p>take six months it could take a little</p><p>longer but I think you&rsquo;re on the right</p><p>track keep building up the insula the</p><p>potassium Reserve which again takes a</p><p>while it takes a while you just can&rsquo;t do</p><p>it overnight and I think you&rsquo;re just</p><p>you&rsquo;re up against the duration of how</p><p>long you had this and you&rsquo;re just gonna</p><p>have to ride it out and give it more</p><p>time before your body even is gonna</p><p>adjust back and come back to where he</p><p>needs to be and then also add the</p><p>exercise in there as well alright thanks</p><p>alright so now we have someone from</p><p>Pennsylvania I think it&rsquo;s okay so let&rsquo;s</p><p>go to Stephanie from North Carolina</p><p>hi and I got really sick like just body</p><p>aches soreness around the neck for about</p><p>a week and a half I don&rsquo;t know I felt</p><p>like it was due to like low potassium so</p><p>I started increasing my carbs and it</p><p>went away so could you tell me if the</p><p>diet had anything to do with well</p><p>typically the swelling usually is either</p><p>higher levels of estrogen okay that</p><p>could be doing it or it could be that</p><p>believe it or not the gallbladder in the</p><p>liver are there to help you convert t4</p><p>to t3 and that can actually back you up</p><p>to the other thing is minerals you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to require more minerals when you</p><p>do the keto and like iodine and trace</p><p>minerals so I probably would have jumped</p><p>to start to do more sea minerals like</p><p>seek help I think that would be the best</p><p>thing to consume and make sure that the</p><p>food that you&rsquo;re eating is more organic</p><p>there&rsquo;s been some data out there that</p><p>says oh yeah if you go a low-carb your</p><p>thyroid is going to suffer but that&rsquo;s</p><p>mainly if you go low-calorie if you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting all the nutrients you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>be a lot better</p><p>I just had an adjusted a Skype on some</p><p>lady recently actually last week that</p><p>Oliver thyroid issues and she had pretty</p><p>bad thyroid issues cleared up when she</p><p>did the fire the keto and</p><p>so I would just compare what you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing with the Kido and just align it</p><p>with what I&rsquo;m talking about in the</p><p>videos and see what is different but I</p><p>don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not really advising go back to</p><p>the carbs but those are some things that</p><p>I would look at all right Stephanie</p><p>thanks</p><p>hey sandy you&rsquo;re Tennessee you&rsquo;re from</p><p>Tennessee and you&rsquo;d a question about</p><p>skin and dakedo I did oh great</p><p>so what&rsquo;s your question okay I started</p><p>the intermittent fasting and the keto</p><p>diet at first part of May and I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done really well with it I&rsquo;ve lost 45</p><p>pounds so I&rsquo;m happy about that but along</p><p>the way I I can&rsquo;t tell you right at the</p><p>moment exactly when it happened but it</p><p>was sudden my skin just started going</p><p>crazy and it was so sudden that it was</p><p>shocking and you know loose and sagging</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t know what happened so what&rsquo;s</p><p>your age I&rsquo;m 71 okay and is is some of</p><p>the set are you</p><p>well when you are you finding that</p><p>you&rsquo;re losing the weight and then</p><p>wherever you&rsquo;re losing weight you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting more loose skin than usual no</p><p>okay no I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m explaining it</p><p>well it could happen very suddenly I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know how to tell you</p><p>you know otherwise I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m happy and I&rsquo;m</p><p>building muscle I actually have built a</p><p>lot of muscle so it&rsquo;s just the problem</p><p>with the sagging skin and you know</p><p>having lost so much weight I can I can</p><p>understand that under normal</p><p>circumstances right but because there</p><p>was so sudden I I don&rsquo;t get it</p><p>okay so can you tell me was there</p><p>anything else that occurred just before</p><p>the sudden change in skin stress gosh</p><p>did you say stress yeah yeah yeah a lot</p><p>of stress in the last year mom okay so</p><p>I&rsquo;m just gonna put you on I&rsquo;m gonna hide</p><p>your voice and so I can talk about that</p><p>there&rsquo;s always some trigger that if</p><p>something occurs suddenly suddenly</p><p>there&rsquo;s always something behind it and</p><p>stress is one big one because it&rsquo;ll</p><p>spike cortisol especially if you&rsquo;re over</p><p>the age of 55 and menopausal I mean you</p><p>start jacking up the adrenal and all the</p><p>sudden you have this this destructive</p><p>nature of cortisol it breaks down</p><p>proteins and it turns into sugar so what</p><p>I would do do whatever you can to</p><p>eliminate that stress and start to focus</p><p>on reducing cortisol so I have the</p><p>videos on that and that include maybe an</p><p>extra hour of sleep maybe walking maybe</p><p>a change of environment maybe</p><p>supplements to support the adrenal</p><p>itself those are the things that you&rsquo;re</p><p>really ultimately need to do to get that</p><p>skin back the other thing with losing</p><p>weight some people have a have a</p><p>combination of not just fat but they</p><p>have a lot of atrophy and so when they</p><p>lose weight it looks even somewhat worse</p><p>because you&rsquo;re getting rid of some of</p><p>the stuff but then it now it&rsquo;s showing</p><p>up even more with atrophy and the thing</p><p>that they have to realize that atrophy</p><p>is a pretty serious condition almost</p><p>equivalent to osteoporosis it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>little thing you&rsquo;re actually losing</p><p>muscle fibers okay they&rsquo;re gone so you</p><p>have a you have strands of connective</p><p>tissue in there you have a lot of</p><p>information so you can heal it but the</p><p>expectations sometimes are person&rsquo;s</p><p>frustrated because they&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going away fast enough so I would or</p><p>someone without Jaffee and they&rsquo;re on a</p><p>great exercise program and they&rsquo;re</p><p>recovering on their eating right they&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to give it like up to</p><p>probably quite a few months if not some</p><p>years to fully get that back to really</p><p>get it back 100% but it&rsquo;s just don&rsquo;t get</p><p>frustrated if it takes longer than</p><p>like because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a more</p><p>advanced situation that you just have to</p><p>realize it&rsquo;s not a little thing okay all</p><p>right hey Chris you&rsquo;re from New York you</p><p>had a question about your kita related</p><p>to workouts yes yes doctor</p><p>so I actually just started keto about</p><p>two and a half weeks ago and I&rsquo;m</p><p>absolutely amazed with the results that</p><p>I get I&rsquo;m an athlete I deal primarily in</p><p>powerlifting sport and I wanted to try</p><p>Kido to see how it affects my diet and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen no real negative ramifications</p><p>from my training my question for you</p><p>actually applies to I guess some of the</p><p>days where we feel like we need a little</p><p>bit of a kick so I consume good quality</p><p>pre workouts and BCAAs so I was</p><p>wondering since I started incorporating</p><p>the intermittent fasting I do a 24</p><p>window is there any possibility of some</p><p>sort of negative ramifications from</p><p>consuming a pre-workout or you know</p><p>consuming BCAAs during the workout</p><p>because I just ordered your wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder and electrolyte powder and</p><p>I would seeing some people saying that</p><p>those are really good alternatives as</p><p>opposed to drinking pre-workout and BCAA</p><p>so I was wondering what your take on it</p><p>so really good question Chris so let me</p><p>answer that branch amino acids</p><p>unfortunately are glycemic okay so</p><p>they&rsquo;re they don&rsquo;t turn into ketones</p><p>they turn into glucose I think a little</p><p>bit might be okay but here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>that what you might want to try there&rsquo;s</p><p>fewer during the week rest juice it&rsquo;s</p><p>almost like a type of healthy coffee</p><p>because it will perk you up</p><p>combined with electrolytes I think that</p><p>will probably solve it the other thing</p><p>that I would look at is d-ribose</p><p>d-ribose is a believe it no no it&rsquo;s a</p><p>low glycemic type of sugar molecule that</p><p>is really good for recovery of muscle</p><p>skeletal and cardiovascular and</p><p>cardio muscle so here you are if you&rsquo;re</p><p>taking branched amino acids to give your</p><p>muscles a chance to recover I would go</p><p>another out and take d-ribose you could</p><p>take the you can take some of those</p><p>branched amino acids at the meal and I</p><p>dunno what you&rsquo;re saying though because</p><p>your if you go from Kyoto and you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing doing some serious power lifting</p><p>your muscles it&rsquo;s going to take a while</p><p>for you really to adapt to the point</p><p>where your energy doesn&rsquo;t drop down when</p><p>you work out one thing I&rsquo;m glad that</p><p>you&rsquo;re not taking any type of like</p><p>caffeine type stimulants because that&rsquo;ll</p><p>bring you up but it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>artificially covering what&rsquo;s going on so</p><p>that&rsquo;s good but it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s a</p><p>transition period where you&rsquo;re into a</p><p>ketone amputation where you&rsquo;re basically</p><p>can easily and quickly shift over a tap</p><p>into the store glycogen Reserve and then</p><p>go right back into the fat burning so</p><p>that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re doing when</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing powerlifting and that&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna probably take some more months to</p><p>get to achieve that but I would do more</p><p>potassium and those minerals with the</p><p>combination wheatgrass right before the</p><p>workout that&rsquo;ll kick it up really a</p><p>notch and maybe even throw it into a Cal</p><p>shake just like just kale and just a</p><p>little bit of berries try those things</p><p>out instead of the branched amino acids</p><p>because if you look that up they will</p><p>spike insulin a little bit that&rsquo;s the</p><p>problem that we&rsquo;re trying to avoid</p><p>alright thanks Chris</p><p>hey Teresa you&rsquo;re from Long Beach and</p><p>you want to have a question about a</p><p>fatty liver yes hi dr. Burke Harry my</p><p>good thanks liver disease and some</p><p>people tell me oh that&rsquo;s nothing really</p><p>to worry about I&rsquo;ll be okay but you know</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really need to do anything</p><p>different but from what I read on the</p><p>videos and I see I there are things that</p><p>I need to do and and other than just</p><p>changing my diet and stuff but I was</p><p>wanting to know is there any way you</p><p>could make a video of some sort for like</p><p>the 70 health plan for like</p><p>breakfast lunch and dinners for fatty</p><p>liver disease or what is it that I need</p><p>you did you did you see I&rsquo;m not good</p><p>with okay so did you see any of my</p><p>videos yet the fatty liver I did see</p><p>some and I drink some of the apple cider</p><p>the other day yeah and um but it took me</p><p>all day to finish the whole water okay</p><p>yeah so we get it done all right well</p><p>let me just kind of give you some data</p><p>on that</p><p>yeah well here&rsquo;s the thing it is an</p><p>important thing to get rid of and you</p><p>can get rid of if I deliver but you&rsquo;re</p><p>not going to be able to get rid of it</p><p>without doing vegetables that&rsquo;s the</p><p>problem I don&rsquo;t want to I don&rsquo;t</p><p>recommend doing fruit it&rsquo;s too high in</p><p>sugar but you&rsquo;re gonna have to find some</p><p>way of injecting these vegetables in</p><p>your body either eating them or with a</p><p>syringe I&rsquo;m just kidding but I think</p><p>that I would highly recommend maybe</p><p>camouflaging the vegetables into a shake</p><p>and I would do a kale shake and if you</p><p>had to add more berries to it and some</p><p>type of maybe he&rsquo;s on the toll or</p><p>something to sweeten it or maybe even</p><p>chocolate and drink that start small and</p><p>then gradually increase it that&rsquo;s really</p><p>what you&rsquo;re gonna have to do if you want</p><p>to fit a liver I mean to go away the</p><p>other thing that you should probably</p><p>order online is something called choline</p><p>get it in a powder mix that in my</p><p>electrolyte drink that way it&rsquo;ll cover</p><p>the taste you drink that too that is</p><p>another B vitamin that will help strip</p><p>off that off the liver in addition to</p><p>the ketogenic diet and in a minute</p><p>fasting the other thing that&rsquo;s really</p><p>really important for you is to</p><p>intermittent fasting so you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>have to bite the bullet to the point</p><p>where you&rsquo;re eating two meals a day</p><p>maybe even one but just go to to a bit</p><p>work up to two and you&rsquo;re gonna see if</p><p>Betty little them improve improve</p><p>improve over time but the problem over</p><p>time is you&rsquo;re going to lose function</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t fix it and you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>have other issues not just with weight</p><p>gain but with higher level of insulin</p><p>resistance and pre-diabetes if you have</p><p>a fatty liver all right</p><p>so bite the bullet I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to eat the vegetables okay</p><p>Franklin you&rsquo;re from Iowa go ahead</p><p>you&rsquo;ve got a question about keto six</p><p>months ever since I discovered your web</p><p>page and your youtube because my rushes</p><p>in the skin and all that then I started</p><p>keto and right now in six months I am in</p><p>intermittent for three months already</p><p>with all the good fats and all no carbs</p><p>no sugar no fruits just sometimes</p><p>bulletproof coffee but very recently</p><p>three weeks ago I had to go to a jeweler</p><p>to remove my appendix I&rsquo;m not gonna</p><p>start blaming here and nobody but my</p><p>follow-up appointment was discovered</p><p>that it was in the appendix it was like</p><p>a bladder so but then I went immediately</p><p>to your YouTube and I searched dr. Berg</p><p>and gallbladder I got all the</p><p>information that you have there and</p><p>specifically the one that went to my</p><p>heart is things you need to know before</p><p>you remove your gallbladder and I agree</p><p>100% with you you did not scare anyone</p><p>but I take it very very very hard hard</p><p>to my heart what you said and it&rsquo;s an</p><p>incredible information I haven&rsquo;t been</p><p>able to eat any raw vegetables for three</p><p>weeks now because of the operation and</p><p>no fats so I&rsquo;m missing my eggs and my</p><p>bacon essentially marriage is that all</p><p>ox bile which I&rsquo;ve been honored to I</p><p>guess order more but yesterday for the</p><p>first time I made use with beet and</p><p>cucumber celery pear and apple why not I</p><p>got so bloated so bloated with that</p><p>juice and I make sure that he didn&rsquo;t get</p><p>any v or in</p><p>Jews so even with the ox bile I&rsquo;m still</p><p>not I&rsquo;m taking our enzymes not able to</p><p>perhaps do well with the gallbladder</p><p>yesterday had they would croissants so I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know yet whether I have stones or</p><p>not I still have to see the doctor do</p><p>you think that I it would be good for me</p><p>to stop eating I think I think bacon and</p><p>eggs which I&rsquo;m missing already</p><p>tremendously okay well so here&rsquo;s the</p><p>data on that you if you take a look at</p><p>what really destroys the gall bladder is</p><p>not the saturated fats because saturated</p><p>fats trigger bile it&rsquo;s the addition of</p><p>the carbs with the saturated fats that</p><p>mess you up it&rsquo;s the addition of the</p><p>sugar with the carbs that mess you up</p><p>even the drink you said when you add the</p><p>pear and the apple that&rsquo;s going to mess</p><p>you up right there because it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>spike insulin so you spike insulin and</p><p>you start to create cholesterol and then</p><p>the cholesterol can build up into stones</p><p>so as long as you keep your sugars zero</p><p>and your carbs low and you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>vegetable carbs without the fruit you</p><p>can get away with the saturated fats now</p><p>of course I&rsquo;m not saying go drink a big</p><p>cup of grease bacon grease in fact if</p><p>you take bacon and you fry it up and you</p><p>take the grease out and you damp it out</p><p>it&rsquo;s just not actually as much fat on</p><p>bacon as you think it&rsquo;s all in the pan</p><p>there&rsquo;s like tons of you&rsquo;re not drinking</p><p>that fat it&rsquo;s just like you there&rsquo;s</p><p>probably more fat and a hamburger than</p><p>it is in bacon because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re frying it off so it&rsquo;s not as much</p><p>it&rsquo;s high in fat as you think cuz I</p><p>analyzed the numbers on it because I was</p><p>like trying to get my fats higher and</p><p>they&rsquo;re like there&rsquo;s not enough fat in</p><p>this bacon and you&rsquo;re not going to eat</p><p>it raw of course so anyway that&rsquo;s one</p><p>thing and the eggs that&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem</p><p>either because the yolk has lecithin</p><p>which counters the fact it&rsquo;s the carbs</p><p>with the proteins or fats that are</p><p>messing you up so that&rsquo;s what I would</p><p>look at the other thing is that you want</p><p>to have I would do probably every single</p><p>day a kale shake put lemon in it maybe</p><p>some wheatgrass juice powder and then</p><p>drink that and then at the end of each</p><p>meal that&rsquo;s when you take the Gaul</p><p>better formula because that has in it</p><p>not just the bile salts that has in it</p><p>but taine honey chloride which helps the</p><p>stomach it has enzymes pancreatic</p><p>enzymes it has things the thin the bile</p><p>that has stone root to dissolve a stone</p><p>so those are all things that I would</p><p>look at the problem with people doing</p><p>keto and ending up with a worse gall</p><p>bladder issue is that they&rsquo;re doing all</p><p>this fat without any vegetables maybe</p><p>they have to adjust the amount of like</p><p>and the fat I&rsquo;m talking about is the</p><p>oils or maybe in coconut oil so adjust</p><p>those but when you&rsquo;re actually having</p><p>like the bacon the egg that&rsquo;s not going</p><p>to be the problem okay maybe too much</p><p>cheese can do it but get the data from</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on your gallbladder see if</p><p>their stones see what&rsquo;s going on see if</p><p>it&rsquo;s slug sluggish if there&rsquo;s still a</p><p>problem then have them do a functional</p><p>gallbladder test where they can measure</p><p>the the function of the gallbladder not</p><p>just statically if there&rsquo;s a stone in</p><p>there or something like that</p><p>all right good question hey Sally you&rsquo;re</p><p>from West Virginia you had a question</p><p>I&rsquo;m fairly new a couple of months on</p><p>here I lost 20 pounds right right now</p><p>bed fast because of the back problem but</p><p>I&rsquo;m having a problem I&rsquo;m not real</p><p>computer suave so I&rsquo;m having trouble</p><p>finding where to go to get your products</p><p>and I wanted to know what I need to get</p><p>to help me out</p><p>I lost my gallbladder several years ago</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t know if that makes a</p><p>difference in my diet or not but I need</p><p>to know what to get and where to start</p><p>out with your products to help me out</p><p>okay I&rsquo;m kind of at a standstill right</p><p>now</p><p>okay great let me I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that</p><p>but let&rsquo;s help you out so first of all</p><p>we need to find out where the gall</p><p>bladder went to get it back so that we</p><p>can sew it back and put it back there no</p><p>I&rsquo;m just kidding</p><p>you can&rsquo;t do that it&rsquo;s gone one thing</p><p>that you&rsquo;re I would start with is the</p><p>digest formula and the gall bladder</p><p>formula get those two and just take the</p><p>gall bladder right after the meal and</p><p>the digest before the meal I think that</p><p>would be a good start for you I would</p><p>also get the book off the website to go</p><p>to dr. Byrd calm you can call the office</p><p>as well and get that information the web</p><p>my numbers all over the place you can</p><p>find it just do a search or you know</p><p>you&rsquo;re looking down below on this</p><p>YouTube or Facebook that it&rsquo;s down there</p><p>as well but here&rsquo;s the thing if you get</p><p>the book it comes with a companion guide</p><p>I would if I were you start with the</p><p>companion guide it&rsquo;s a real short little</p><p>booklet that you can read in an hour</p><p>that gives you the basics of what you</p><p>need so that way you can focus on the</p><p>basics the simple part of it and then if</p><p>you can go to my website I have a little</p><p>mini course you can take it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>complimentary course it&rsquo;s all the way to</p><p>the right of the website under extra it</p><p>says Quito you can just watch that a</p><p>series of quick videos watch that get</p><p>the basics that&rsquo;s what you really need</p><p>right now and then from there you can go</p><p>from there but I think you probably</p><p>benefit calling the office talked to my</p><p>health coach that&rsquo;s trained and just</p><p>sort out maybe what you would need based</p><p>on your specific problems because</p><p>everyone needs a little bit of different</p><p>things so that&rsquo;s what I would do to call</p><p>the office thanks Ali hey Aaron you&rsquo;re</p><p>from Ohio go ahead you had a question</p><p>yes dr. Burke thank you yes I was</p><p>calling because I happen to notice</p><p>lately it seems more so than typical</p><p>that I my hair falling out I notice it</p><p>inside there on the inside of my bald</p><p>cap a good example last night I was just</p><p>sitting in the chair getting ready for</p><p>bed and kind of like brushing through my</p><p>hair for whatever reason and I noticed a</p><p>couple two three five strands of hair</p><p>just kind of like on my hand like what</p><p>the heck is this you know and I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>on keto now for about going on six</p><p>months I lost 35 pounds with it and I&rsquo;ve</p><p>kind of tweaked my die here and there</p><p>trying different foods to keep it fresh</p><p>and I&rsquo;m more recently because I&rsquo;ve had</p><p>trouble keeping my ketone numbers higher</p><p>throughout the day because I test my</p><p>ketone and blood levels blood sugar</p><p>levels with a one of those Chester&rsquo;s you</p><p>know the I forget what the name of it is</p><p>and so I kind of keep a real good track</p><p>and an eye on where where I&rsquo;m at</p><p>throughout the day and every morning and</p><p>I noticed that my ketone levels are</p><p>fairly low when I wake up and I&rsquo;m very</p><p>good about keeping my carbs low and</p><p>moderate okey now more recently I was</p><p>eating a lot of protein but now I&rsquo;ve</p><p>gotten it I&rsquo;ve scaled that back I</p><p>noticed that was causing me to have a</p><p>little bit of higher blood sugars in the</p><p>mornings but I&rsquo;ve been consuming a lot</p><p>more fat particularly coconut oil MCT</p><p>oil grass-fed butter and in teas and</p><p>could that have anything to do with this</p><p>or you have any suggest I mean yeah I&rsquo;ve</p><p>broken off of caffeine because I heard</p><p>curtin cortisol and you know different</p><p>things can de-stress you know can</p><p>trigger things like that so I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ve</p><p>taken that out of the diet out of the</p><p>picture what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your blood</p><p>sugar is running in on a good day I&rsquo;ve</p><p>got it down in the 80s a good example</p><p>this morning it was 90</p><p>sorry 91 first thing waking up and in a</p><p>point zero or a point three ketone okay</p><p>seem to get much lower I mean the keep</p><p>my blood Sugar&rsquo;s are always generally in</p><p>the 90s after after a meal they might go</p><p>up to 125 I see sometimes yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s normal okay good so let&rsquo;s talk</p><p>about that Aaron I think first of all</p><p>realize that the longer you do the</p><p>ketone diet you&rsquo;re ketones and your</p><p>urine are gonna go down down down down</p><p>so that&rsquo;s not a bad thing it just means</p><p>that you&rsquo;re burning ketones they&rsquo;re not</p><p>being eliminated through the urine so I</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t based your success on that in</p><p>fact you want to get to the point where</p><p>you have no more ketones in urine</p><p>because they&rsquo;re all burned up you&rsquo;re</p><p>very efficient the main thing is look at</p><p>these other factors in your stomach</p><p>going down do you feel better but see</p><p>the fact that the hairs you&rsquo;re losing</p><p>hair tells me that you&rsquo;re missing some</p><p>nutrient I would go with the trace</p><p>minerals get a plant base first but the</p><p>trace minerals are the no-brainer</p><p>because that&rsquo;s usually what&rsquo;s missing in</p><p>the diet and as you switch over to keto</p><p>you were</p><p>fire more of certain nutrients and</p><p>therefore that could be reason why</p><p>you&rsquo;re losing hair there is a hair</p><p>formula I have that it doesn&rsquo;t just have</p><p>trace minerals it has a bunch of other</p><p>things so that could help you probably a</p><p>little more than just getting that trace</p><p>minerals because it has things for if</p><p>you have high straw testosterone or</p><p>maybe you need certain B vitamins and</p><p>biotin or college and it&rsquo;s more of a</p><p>comprehensive thing so I think I would</p><p>probably go with that rap but I would</p><p>also make sure that instead of going up</p><p>with the fad go up with your go with</p><p>them some fad but go up with more</p><p>vegetables okay so keep those high and</p><p>keep the protein at a moderate amount</p><p>but I think the biggest thing is that</p><p>you&rsquo;re missing some nutrient right now</p><p>and the hair is a good indication of</p><p>that it&rsquo;s probably gonna be trace</p><p>minerals</p><p>thanks Aaron okay Clara you are calling</p><p>from New York you had a question</p><p>now I&rsquo;ve been on a keto diet and also</p><p>intermittent fasting for a month and a</p><p>half and I already lost 19 pounds</p><p>Wow like my thing is them like the</p><p>vegetables they just take too much time</p><p>to eat and I&rsquo;ve been trying to do I mean</p><p>you know like seven cups to ten cups but</p><p>I&rsquo;m but what I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m juicing them</p><p>so I blend them and then I add</p><p>nutritional yeast and then your</p><p>electrolyte card powder works wonders I</p><p>put half in it because it&rsquo;s too sweet</p><p>for me now my question is um but I I</p><p>mean and then also - I&rsquo;ve been fasting</p><p>like between 16 to 22 hours and so can</p><p>the green juice disturbed effect if I</p><p>take it like yeah drink it in the</p><p>morning I think I think honestly I if</p><p>you make sure you don&rsquo;t add any other</p><p>things in it like Apple instead or</p><p>carrot I think it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to do</p><p>that</p><p>okay because you&rsquo;re already fasted for</p><p>22 hours though if you add that in there</p><p>I think I would recommend that and I</p><p>think it would be good because that way</p><p>you&rsquo;re getting your grains will it break</p><p>the fast only maybe a little bit and</p><p>it&rsquo;ll a lot if you add any type of sweet</p><p>things in there so to think I think the</p><p>way you&rsquo;re doing is fine some people</p><p>also ask what about the wheatgrass juice</p><p>powder first of all the carbs on that or</p><p>the sugar carbs are so low that and you</p><p>in the scoop that you&rsquo;re consuming it&rsquo;s</p><p>like such a minor point it&rsquo;s not gonna</p><p>even faze anything but when you&rsquo;re</p><p>actually doing what you&rsquo;re doing weird I</p><p>think you said you&rsquo;re putting the fiber</p><p>in there too it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a little bit more</p><p>but I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a a minor</p><p>point so but I do understand a lot of</p><p>people don&rsquo;t like to eat vegetables so I</p><p>do the kale shake every other day in the</p><p>morning so it seems to not break my fast</p><p>and I&rsquo;m doing fine of course I&rsquo;m not</p><p>adding anything else in there alright</p><p>good question hey Margie you&rsquo;re from</p><p>Pennsylvania go ahead you to question hi</p><p>um dr. Berg I take magnesium and on the</p><p>bottle it says it&rsquo;s 350 milligrams which</p><p>is a half a teaspoon daily and I also do</p><p>the apple cider vinegar it&rsquo;s not enough</p><p>for how many times a day I guess I want</p><p>to know should I do those two things</p><p>well</p><p>how many you said you&rsquo;re doing how many</p><p>scoops of magnesium yes I have it on the</p><p>Bible it says a half a teaspoon daily</p><p>which is 350 milligrams and is that are</p><p>you taking magnesium citrate or calcium</p><p>magnesium okay and are you doing are you</p><p>doing any type of vegetables like what&rsquo;s</p><p>the quantity cups of vegetables are you</p><p>doing it per day I do vegetables but not</p><p>daily and I&rsquo;m also on intermittent diet</p><p>but I have a loss any I&rsquo;ve been on</p><p>intermittent diets for about six months</p><p>but I haven&rsquo;t really lost anyway okay</p><p>well one thing you probably do is call</p><p>the office to get to find out why you&rsquo;re</p><p>not losing weight but if you want if you</p><p>prefer your magnesium question</p><p>you need about 460 to 490 milligrams a</p><p>day so you could I recommend getting</p><p>some of that from vegetables if you want</p><p>to add some more that&rsquo;s fine I like the</p><p>fact that you&rsquo;re doing magnesium citrate</p><p>that&rsquo;s a really smart thing because the</p><p>sit rates also have a lot of other</p><p>benefits for preventing kidney stones</p><p>and gout but the other mineral that you</p><p>want to focus on is potassium because</p><p>potassium you need let me think about</p><p>you need forty seven hundred milligrams</p><p>magnesium you need four hundred and</p><p>sixty milligrams so you need a little</p><p>bit of magnesium you know a lot of</p><p>potassium so the question is why are you</p><p>doing magnesium and not potassium that&rsquo;s</p><p>the big question so that&rsquo;s what I would</p><p>recommend thanks Margie hey Heather you</p><p>had a question from California dr. Burke</p><p>how are you ready from early morning</p><p>California yeah I have I started gaining</p><p>weight at 13 years of age and I think</p><p>righted my hormone set I think I</p><p>realized I&rsquo;ve like genetics of insulin</p><p>resistance and I had been dieting up and</p><p>on anyway I found the ketogenic diet</p><p>three years ago and I&rsquo;ve been doing it</p><p>for three years I lost 80 pounds and it</p><p>literally has changed my life I think</p><p>God for it well but I and I love you in</p><p>and Karen&rsquo;s videos on food I&rsquo;m and I</p><p>have a question with regards to your</p><p>bread recipe you&rsquo;re the arrowroot powder</p><p>or every flower that you use when I</p><p>looked it up because I am one of those</p><p>MyFitnessPal kind of girls just for my</p><p>own just I guess because it&rsquo;s about my</p><p>control freak personality but it had a</p><p>hundred grams of carbohydrates for that</p><p>portion that you guys use in it and that</p><p>just seems extremely high Denise I&rsquo;m</p><p>wondering what you guys have thought</p><p>process on it and then if there&rsquo;s any</p><p>alternative because I really do try to</p><p>keep my carbohydrates under you know the</p><p>no I wouldn&rsquo;t say traditional but 20 to</p><p>25 yeah</p><p>a day yeah so that&rsquo;s a really good</p><p>question that comes up that would be for</p><p>the entire loaf of bread okay it&rsquo;s not</p><p>for a certain size so hundred grit but</p><p>broken down even if even if you broke it</p><p>down I mean that still seems I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know for me it seems a bit high yeah I</p><p>just didn&rsquo;t know if there was like an</p><p>alternative or something yeah so I</p><p>recommended so so here&rsquo;s the thing with</p><p>the bread the to make bread tastes good</p><p>oh my gosh it has been quite the</p><p>chemistry experiment and without that</p><p>one ingredient it&rsquo;s like I mean you&rsquo;d</p><p>probably made the bread and taste what</p><p>it tastes like it&rsquo;s like the most</p><p>incredible bread it&rsquo;s like even better</p><p>than regular bread it&rsquo;s just credit</p><p>amazing so if you&rsquo;re just doing a little</p><p>piece once a day you&rsquo;re gonna be well</p><p>even below the minimum carb you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to be probably doing maybe 10 carbs from</p><p>that a day because you&rsquo;re allowed 20 to</p><p>even 50 grams so that&rsquo;s really why we&rsquo;re</p><p>recommending for certain people</p><p>occasionally that just have to have</p><p>bread we don&rsquo;t have it often and I have</p><p>not found another ingredient that</p><p>matches that one to really put it in</p><p>together</p><p>we&rsquo;re still looking we&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>experiment but it&rsquo;s a very good point</p><p>and it&rsquo;s one of those things that if</p><p>you&rsquo;re a carb sensitive we don&rsquo;t want</p><p>you making that bread but for those</p><p>people that are in ketosis and they can</p><p>afford a little bit more carbs that</p><p>would be the thing to do because the</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty healthy bread but again 100</p><p>carbs that&rsquo;s way too much that would eat</p><p>if he had the whole loaf but if you had</p><p>a very small amount it probably would</p><p>not affect you too much as long as you</p><p>added a lot of butter to it okay great</p><p>question Heather thanks hey Anne you had</p><p>a question from North Carolina go ahead</p><p>hi good morning good morning</p><p>I kind of answered my question I think</p><p>was a previous caller but I have your</p><p>weak best supplement your electrolyte</p><p>supplement and I was wondering if it&rsquo;s</p><p>okay to take those</p><p>you&rsquo;re in your fat got it good question</p><p>yeah in fact yeah there&rsquo;s not going to</p><p>be a problem at all you can take the</p><p>potassium in the wheatgrass during the</p><p>fast on an empty stomach is not going to</p><p>have any amount of significant carbs or</p><p>sugars to raise your insulin at all and</p><p>it probably will give you a boost of</p><p>energy because especially the the</p><p>combination is pretty powerful and also</p><p>the wheatgrass you&rsquo;re getting so much</p><p>nutrition I just did a a test and I</p><p>found there&rsquo;s I actually b12 in there so</p><p>that&rsquo;s going to actually help you I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna do another test on the wheatgrass</p><p>and a comparison with other brands just</p><p>to show people I&rsquo;m gonna do this on the</p><p>phytonutrients the carotenoids the</p><p>flavonoids and the chlorophyll so I can</p><p>show people the massive amount of</p><p>additional photo nutrients that you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting compared to other things</p><p>especially good wheatgrass powder versus</p><p>a wheatgrass juice powder so I&rsquo;ll share</p><p>that with everyone once I get it but</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s not going to spike at all</p><p>alright thank you so much for calling in</p><p>hey guys we guess has some great</p><p>questions I really appreciate it we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna resume next week on Friday watch</p><p>my videos in the morning because we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna release it every morning two</p><p>videos in one so thank you and have a</p><p>great</p><p>[Music]</p><p>you</p></section><footer
