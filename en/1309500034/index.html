<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>hi my name is bailey sarian</p>
<p>and on mondays i sit down and talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you on mondays</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about a very</p>
<p>awful story oh my gosh wow it&rsquo;s dramatic warning</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue and strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion</p>
<p>is advised so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start with evan</p>
<p>heathlin she grew up in oak ridge tennessee</p>
<p>it was said that she was</p>
<p>sweet and loving and</p>
<p>you know when you talk to</p>
<p>aaron she just</p>
<p>made you feel like you were the most important person</p>
<p>in the room she</p>
<p>was an animal</p>
<p>lover she had a</p>
<p>talent for taming</p>
<p>horses that</p>
<p>no one else came</p>
<p>close to and aaron&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first horse was</p>
<p>named autumn</p>
<p>and her whole</p>
<p>world just seemed to revolve around</p>
<p>horses it was in a barn</p>
<p>where she met a guy</p>
<p>named jonathan corwin</p>
<p>who would become her future husband</p>
<p>but when they</p>
<p>first met aaron</p>
<p>she was only in</p>
<p>fifth grade</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing just because the</p>
<p>thought of them getting</p>
<p>married or something in</p>
<p>fifth grade</p>
<p>just made me giggle a little bit but john was one year</p>
<p>older than aaron</p>
<p>and they became</p>
<p>very close friends</p>
<p>and they remained</p>
<p>close friends and then when they turned 16 17</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when john</p>
<p>went to her parents and</p>
<p>asked for permission to date her</p>
<p>which they approved and the two of them</p>
<p>started dating on</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s 16th birthday</p>
<p>as their relationship blossomed and they fell in love</p>
<p>aaron would</p>
<p>often write john like little love poems</p>
<p>and from the outside looking in</p>
<p>it just seemed</p>
<p>like they were this perfect all american couple</p>
<p>just swept up in their</p>
<p>fairy tale romance you know</p>
<p>john would go on to join the marines and shortly</p>
<p>after that the</p>
<p>young couple got</p>
<p>married in november of</p>
<p>2012 aaron&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she was a little</p>
<p>worried that like</p>
<p>aaron would have</p>
<p>trouble adjusting to life as the wife</p>
<p>of a marine</p>
<p>because she knew that they</p>
<p>would have to move around a lot and</p>
<p>aaron was known</p>
<p>to be a little bit on the shy side</p>
<p>so making friends you know</p>
<p>having to make friends constantly</p>
<p>might be a bit of a challenge</p>
<p>for her but for the most part they seem to be very</p>
<p>happy and in love</p>
<p>who really knows though</p>
<p>right after all</p>
<p>these stories i&rsquo;m like who</p>
<p>you you can be the perfect person perfect</p>
<p>marriage and there&rsquo;s no such</p>
<p>thing no such</p>
<p>thing anyways</p>
<p>september twenty thirteen</p>
<p>the couple john and</p>
<p>aaron they moved to</p>
<p>the marine base in</p>
<p>twenty nine palms</p>
<p>california it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like out in the middle of the desert so hot when they</p>
<p>moved in they became</p>
<p>friends pretty</p>
<p>quickly with the family who live downstairs from them</p>
<p>their name was connor</p>
<p>and aisling</p>
<p>and then they had like a little baby chew</p>
<p>and then they also had</p>
<p>another neighbor</p>
<p>and their name was chris and nicole lee plus</p>
<p>their six year old</p>
<p>daughter liberty</p>
<p>and they lived like</p>
<p>right next door</p>
<p>so family under them family next door</p>
<p>so while the husbands were doing</p>
<p>their thing</p>
<p>base a lot of the times the wives</p>
<p>the three neighbors</p>
<p>aaron aisling and nicole</p>
<p>they would all like hang out together they</p>
<p>would have lunch they</p>
<p>chat and when the husbands were home they</p>
<p>would barbecue</p>
<p>have little</p>
<p>movie nights you know it was</p>
<p>just nice to have some friends in this new location at</p>
<p>first life on the base seemed to be going</p>
<p>fine and dandy</p>
<p>but soon just the normal struggles of</p>
<p>married life</p>
<p>made their appearance and</p>
<p>aaron and john&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>money was a big issue</p>
<p>and the two of them</p>
<p>would often</p>
<p>argue over it accusing</p>
<p>one another of overspending your overspent you</p>
<p>why did you buy that why are you buying you know just</p>
<p>you never have enough money</p>
<p>right and there&rsquo;s just always something to</p>
<p>fight about over it so they&rsquo;re bickering a lot soon</p>
<p>after aaron</p>
<p>found out that she was pregnant and</p>
<p>once like that became the new</p>
<p>focus the money issues were just put on the back burner</p>
<p>and they were just excited to</p>
<p>start a family of</p>
<p>their own so</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s excited she wanted to be a mom</p>
<p>and she of course went to facebook and</p>
<p>posted on facebook that she was pregnant she was like</p>
<p>sharing it with her friends and family back at home</p>
<p>you know everyone&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>excited for her and</p>
<p>aaron couldn&rsquo;t wait to be a mom so several weeks go by</p>
<p>after posting</p>
<p>the announcement on facebook</p>
<p>and sadly aaron</p>
<p>ended up miscarrying the baby</p>
<p>she was absolutely</p>
<p>devastated heartbroken just</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t imagine what that feels like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so sad in the us</p>
<p>about 10 to 15</p>
<p>out of every 100</p>
<p>pregnancies</p>
<p>end in a miscarriage</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t make it easier knowing that</p>
<p>knowing the statistics really and despite</p>
<p>there being</p>
<p>others who have shared the</p>
<p>experience like many</p>
<p>women who go through the</p>
<p>trauma of losing a baby before</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s born aaron</p>
<p>felt very much</p>
<p>alone and she</p>
<p>started to kind of withdraw from her marriage</p>
<p>and just her social circle she was</p>
<p>growing emotionally distant</p>
<p>her husband said</p>
<p>that he really didn&rsquo;t know how to comfort her at all</p>
<p>he tried to but</p>
<p>he just didn&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>and unfortunately it just really</p>
<p>started to drive a</p>
<p>pretty big wedge between the two of them</p>
<p>but there was someone else</p>
<p>who was there for</p>
<p>aaron during</p>
<p>these difficult times</p>
<p>it was her friend</p>
<p>and neighbor</p>
<p>chris lee so</p>
<p>aaron at this time was 19 years old so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still really</p>
<p>young and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>struggling with the loss of her pregnancy</p>
<p>and her husband</p>
<p>again doesn&rsquo;t really know how to comfort her</p>
<p>aaron would</p>
<p>strike up a conversation with 25 year old</p>
<p>christopher lee</p>
<p>again the neighbor</p>
<p>and chris was one of</p>
<p>those guys who just really</p>
<p>loved to make people laugh</p>
<p>but he had his</p>
<p>own sadness that he seemed to be battling with</p>
<p>and him and</p>
<p>aaron seemed to like really connect</p>
<p>with that like chris was dealing with his own</p>
<p>depression because recently</p>
<p>he had been denied deployment normally this</p>
<p>would have the opposite effect</p>
<p>but for chris it was considered a heroic</p>
<p>honor to go</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just something he so</p>
<p>greatly wanted to do</p>
<p>so when he was denied</p>
<p>it was devastating to him and he was very very</p>
<p>upset so chris had told</p>
<p>aaron that he</p>
<p>would play russian roulette</p>
<p>every morning</p>
<p>to decide like if he was</p>
<p>gonna go on</p>
<p>with his day or not if you don&rsquo;t know russian roulette</p>
<p>is a game game</p>
<p>where you have a loaded gun</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s partially loaded usually like one of the</p>
<p>things is loaded</p>
<p>and then you pull the</p>
<p>trigger to see if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go off or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the kind of behavior that you</p>
<p>should definitely</p>
<p>reach out for</p>
<p>medical help</p>
<p>not necessarily</p>
<p>tell your neighbor in a casual conversation</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>aaron felt bad for him</p>
<p>you know she was very</p>
<p>drawn to people who were</p>
<p>broken or hurting so</p>
<p>helping care for chris it gave her a</p>
<p>sense of purpose</p>
<p>being there for him</p>
<p>also just talking with chris really distracted her from</p>
<p>you know with the pain</p>
<p>from like losing her baby so they both just kind of</p>
<p>found comfort and purpose in</p>
<p>their friendship it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never good when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a bad</p>
<p>place and you seek out companionship</p>
<p>other than the person that you are</p>
<p>in a relationship with like it that usually</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t end well you know</p>
<p>and i mean here we are on this</p>
<p>monday upload so therefore i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty sure this won&rsquo;t end well</p>
<p>great chris and</p>
<p>aaron had already</p>
<p>spent a good amount of time together within</p>
<p>their friend</p>
<p>group but with</p>
<p>their new bond they</p>
<p>started hanging out more</p>
<p>and more when like</p>
<p>their spouses</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>mm mm mm hmm</p>
<p>aaron she also</p>
<p>spent like a lot of her free time volunteering at</p>
<p>place called</p>
<p>white rock horse rescue</p>
<p>where chris and his wife nicole</p>
<p>also sponsored</p>
<p>horses at so</p>
<p>aaron would</p>
<p>spend a lot of her time there and chris</p>
<p>would end up</p>
<p>going over there as well</p>
<p>spending you know</p>
<p>a little bit of</p>
<p>extra time with</p>
<p>aaron at the barn</p>
<p>without his wife around</p>
<p>they were becoming very</p>
<p>close and aaron felt like</p>
<p>she finally had somebody like to really talk to and</p>
<p>someone to really express how she was feeling inside</p>
<p>and and chris felt the same way then on</p>
<p>sunday night in february of 2014</p>
<p>chris and his wife nicole went over to</p>
<p>aaron and john&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>watch a new episode of the walking dead together now</p>
<p>aaron she wasn&rsquo;t really into the show so much because</p>
<p>she felt like it was a little too violent for her</p>
<p>so she hung out for a bit and then she like</p>
<p>headed off to her bedroom to play some</p>
<p>video games instead</p>
<p>so chris sees</p>
<p>aaron take off</p>
<p>and instead of hanging out with his wife and john</p>
<p>watching the show</p>
<p>he gets up and he heads to the bedroom to hang out with</p>
<p>aaron and play</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>so chris he</p>
<p>loved the walking dead so it was a little</p>
<p>weird that he decided to not</p>
<p>watch it but i</p>
<p>guess like it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>weird enough</p>
<p>to catch his</p>
<p>wife&rsquo;s attention because she didn&rsquo;t follow him</p>
<p>not that she</p>
<p>should but you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so john and nicole</p>
<p>are in the living room</p>
<p>watching the walking dead</p>
<p>and chris and</p>
<p>aaron are hanging out sitting on the</p>
<p>floor playing</p>
<p>video games in</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>i guess all of a</p>
<p>sudden just out of nowhere</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>pauses the video game and aaron</p>
<p>like kind of glances over at chris and i</p>
<p>guess it must have been kind of like a sexy glance</p>
<p>because then they</p>
<p>started just like</p>
<p>making out yeah they just</p>
<p>started making out</p>
<p>in the bedroom mind you</p>
<p>very bold move to do when your husband and wife are</p>
<p>right in the other room</p>
<p>watching tv but okay sure</p>
<p>do that kiss</p>
<p>great they did</p>
<p>and this kiss</p>
<p>would end up like leading them</p>
<p>to becoming involved in their own</p>
<p>love affair</p>
<p>so the love</p>
<p>affair between the two became pretty hot and</p>
<p>heavy pretty</p>
<p>quickly they were</p>
<p>sneaking around a lot and it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>until they started having more</p>
<p>serious conversations</p>
<p>about leaving</p>
<p>their partners</p>
<p>so they can be together instead</p>
<p>and to top it off chris</p>
<p>he would constantly tell</p>
<p>aaron like how</p>
<p>great she was with his</p>
<p>baby who was six years old</p>
<p>her name was</p>
<p>liberty and</p>
<p>aaron would</p>
<p>occasionally</p>
<p>babysit her</p>
<p>and he was like oh my gosh like</p>
<p>liberty loves you like</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re gonna be a</p>
<p>great stepmom</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s saying this to</p>
<p>aaron and aaron&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>oh my god yeah i know i can&rsquo;t wait like she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>super hyped</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i just feel</p>
<p>like involving your kid like that&rsquo;s pretty messed up</p>
<p>but okay chris is all</p>
<p>wrapped up in his affair with</p>
<p>aaron right</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>checking out from his</p>
<p>marriage nicole</p>
<p>chris&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>she starts to notice how distant her husband was</p>
<p>becoming and like</p>
<p>she knew something something was just not right</p>
<p>you know so what does she do</p>
<p>checks his phone of course</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a huge invasion of privacy</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>if her man is cheating</p>
<p>she wants to know</p>
<p>so nicole just waits for her perfect moment to</p>
<p>grab chris&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>check it read his text messages and stuff</p>
<p>and when she does she sees text messages between chris</p>
<p>and aaron mm</p>
<p>hmm and when she saw a text message that said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so gorgeous i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m falling for you</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t good i&rsquo;m sure that hurt</p>
<p>right in the stomach ugh</p>
<p>makes you sick you know</p>
<p>so nicole&rsquo;s like shit man</p>
<p>i knew something was up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the neighbor though like i</p>
<p>trusted this girl</p>
<p>with baby singing</p>
<p>our kids we&rsquo;ve been hanging out we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>i thought we were friends so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s pissed for good reason so</p>
<p>first she finds chris and then she just goes off</p>
<p>as she should you know</p>
<p>and the two just get into a</p>
<p>verbal argument for</p>
<p>hours and then</p>
<p>because it takes two to tango</p>
<p>nicole marches</p>
<p>right over to john and aaron&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place next door</p>
<p>and tells john</p>
<p>about the affair his wife was having with chris oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>super messy lots of</p>
<p>drama going on</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just a lot of bickering</p>
<p>fighting amongst everybody</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a long</p>
<p>night with everybody yelling</p>
<p>at one another accomplishing not much of anything but</p>
<p>just let it out girl</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just all fighting</p>
<p>together great</p>
<p>and eventually</p>
<p>aaron she just is</p>
<p>over it and she&rsquo;s like you know what i&rsquo;m done i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need this anymore like i just need to get out of here</p>
<p>everyone is in her</p>
<p>house and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just yelling at one another and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>aaron just decides you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna leave and</p>
<p>and aaron goes to</p>
<p>leave when nicole stops her</p>
<p>shoves her finger in</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s face and</p>
<p>screams at her</p>
<p>if you ever have anything else to do with my husband</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll kill you myself</p>
<p>nicole went off</p>
<p>for good reason</p>
<p>again you know</p>
<p>that was her friend someone she</p>
<p>trusted how dare you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming here that</p>
<p>john was pissed off as well but he stayed pretty quiet</p>
<p>about his feelings and thoughts on the</p>
<p>whole situation</p>
<p>like with the public even</p>
<p>later on you barely hear from him he was just a very</p>
<p>quiet guy i mean i feel like we</p>
<p>should be that way you know</p>
<p>so good for</p>
<p>him can&rsquo;t be mad at it but what i&rsquo;m getting at is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what his reaction was to</p>
<p>finding out</p>
<p>that his wife is having an affair with the neighbor</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m assuming he&rsquo;s upset</p>
<p>so after this huge blow up</p>
<p>aaron and chris they decide you know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best if we just call it quits it was fun</p>
<p>while it lasted</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>we need to stop and just</p>
<p>focus on our marriages</p>
<p>whatever well</p>
<p>they call it quits and a couple of weeks go by</p>
<p>just a couple of weeks</p>
<p>and of course the</p>
<p>two cannot resist one another but they both knew that</p>
<p>their love affair was</p>
<p>gonna have an</p>
<p>expiration date</p>
<p>because chris&rsquo;s service in the marines was</p>
<p>scheduled to end on july fourth 2014</p>
<p>when his service was over the plan was for him</p>
<p>his wife nicole and</p>
<p>their baby to move back to alaska</p>
<p>and that was approaching</p>
<p>pretty quickly it was</p>
<p>literally a few weeks away something happens</p>
<p>right before the</p>
<p>their big move back to alaska</p>
<p>aaron finds out that she&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>but this time</p>
<p>instead of being</p>
<p>super jazzed and</p>
<p>going to facebook and like posting about it</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to feel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed she felt</p>
<p>this way because she wasn&rsquo;t sure who the father was</p>
<p>her husband john or her</p>
<p>lover chris i</p>
<p>think she knew it was chris&rsquo;s because she</p>
<p>would tell chris that she was pregnant</p>
<p>but she couldn&rsquo;t say for sure</p>
<p>ooh you&rsquo;re in a pickle</p>
<p>you fucked up</p>
<p>you fucked up</p>
<p>this is a side note but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have an affair the</p>
<p>least you can do is wear a condom</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that hard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that hard if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do it at</p>
<p>least be smart</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be making</p>
<p>stupid choices</p>
<p>and then make another</p>
<p>stupid choice</p>
<p>by not no no</p>
<p>absolutely not</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>stupid you gotta be</p>
<p>smart about it wrap it up</p>
<p>thank you for coming to my</p>
<p>ted talk on june</p>
<p>twenty eighth</p>
<p>twenty fourteen</p>
<p>chris was supposed to go coyote</p>
<p>hunting with his</p>
<p>buddy out in</p>
<p>joshua tree national park</p>
<p>he told his friend</p>
<p>that he wanted to go hunt for coyotes</p>
<p>but also there was a</p>
<p>bunch of abandoned mine</p>
<p>shafts out there</p>
<p>and he thought it</p>
<p>would be super</p>
<p>exciting to go and explode</p>
<p>a propane tank in one of the mine shafts</p>
<p>you know just for the hell of it</p>
<p>so chris is</p>
<p>super jazzed</p>
<p>about this he&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>excited to go</p>
<p>but his friend</p>
<p>that was supposed to go with him called him up last</p>
<p>minute and had a bail</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s all bombed he&rsquo;s like damn it</p>
<p>whatever i&rsquo;ll just go by myself and blow stuff up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what chris is saying</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what he does he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna go by himself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s a super strange coincidence here</p>
<p>but aaron was also</p>
<p>planning to go over to joshua tree that day</p>
<p>she told her husband john that she was</p>
<p>going out to joshua tree</p>
<p>to kind of like</p>
<p>scope out some</p>
<p>places to take her mom</p>
<p>when she came out to visit them</p>
<p>so she tells john goodbye she&rsquo;s heading out for the day</p>
<p>she leans over she gives him a kiss she says i love you</p>
<p>he says love you back</p>
<p>and then she heads out to</p>
<p>joshua tree</p>
<p>mind you joshua tree it&rsquo;s not that far from 29 palms</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>close it&rsquo;s like just one big desert</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure what</p>
<p>aaron was looking for out there but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where she was</p>
<p>going so those are the stories that chris and aaron</p>
<p>told people</p>
<p>right chris is</p>
<p>going out to hunt coyotes by himself and aaron was</p>
<p>going to look for</p>
<p>places to take her mom however</p>
<p>turns out the relationship between the two of them</p>
<p>was far from over</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>days before they both headed out to the desert</p>
<p>chris told aaron</p>
<p>that he had a surprise for her and</p>
<p>asked her to meet up with him</p>
<p>in joshua tree</p>
<p>aaron who again is pregnant with</p>
<p>her lovers baby</p>
<p>maybe we don&rsquo;t know she was</p>
<p>excited because she thought that</p>
<p>chris was asking her to meet out there because he was</p>
<p>going to propose to her</p>
<p>or maybe like</p>
<p>break the news</p>
<p>that he was finally ending it between his wife</p>
<p>and would be with aaron now</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>could live happily ever</p>
<p>after you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s believed</p>
<p>that this is why</p>
<p>aaron was going out there</p>
<p>to joshua tree</p>
<p>not to spot out</p>
<p>places to visit her mom</p>
<p>she was going there to</p>
<p>meet up with chris</p>
<p>back at home john</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>he was texting her throughout the day but</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t getting any response from</p>
<p>aaron and by the time</p>
<p>night rolls around</p>
<p>aaron is still not home</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not answering her calls</p>
<p>her texts nothing</p>
<p>super strange very unlike her sometime goes by and</p>
<p>aaron is still not home</p>
<p>so john he files</p>
<p>a missing persons report with the police</p>
<p>they come out and they ask him questions</p>
<p>and at first they assumed that</p>
<p>maybe she got lost</p>
<p>so the joshua tree national park</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really big it&rsquo;s flat</p>
<p>so it is possible she</p>
<p>could have gone for a hike</p>
<p>or something and if she didn&rsquo;t plan</p>
<p>correctly it</p>
<p>could be highly possible that she</p>
<p>was out wandering the desert suffering from dehydration</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally not much around so</p>
<p>that is definitely a possibility</p>
<p>and if that is really the case then</p>
<p>aaron would not last long okay</p>
<p>so police they go out to joshua tree</p>
<p>and they end up finding her car abandoned</p>
<p>but it was nowhere near</p>
<p>the entrance of the park</p>
<p>where she said she was</p>
<p>gonna be at</p>
<p>so police they</p>
<p>start investigating all the people in</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s life to see what they could find</p>
<p>as with most husbands john was immediately</p>
<p>on top of their interest list</p>
<p>but after talking to people around the base</p>
<p>john was ruled out very</p>
<p>quickly as a possible suspect</p>
<p>because there were many people</p>
<p>who saw john at the base pretty much the whole day</p>
<p>so there was no way</p>
<p>john could have been involved with the disappearance of</p>
<p>aaron then the cops</p>
<p>start talking to friends and neighbors and they learn</p>
<p>not only of chris and</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s not so</p>
<p>secret affair</p>
<p>but also that aaron</p>
<p>may have been pregnant</p>
<p>they also got word</p>
<p>about this special surprise chris had</p>
<p>planned out in the desert</p>
<p>so naturally police</p>
<p>have to go find chris</p>
<p>and figure out what the hell is</p>
<p>going on so police</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to look far he is a neighbor</p>
<p>right so they go to chris and they ask</p>
<p>um hey do you know what happened to aaron</p>
<p>and chris tells investigators that</p>
<p>he and aaron were just acquaintances and nothing more</p>
<p>he only knew</p>
<p>aaron because they both volunteered at the</p>
<p>horse ranch place and</p>
<p>that was it</p>
<p>now at this</p>
<p>point police already knew</p>
<p>about the affair</p>
<p>so red flags are just a fly in</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s lying what&rsquo;s he hiding</p>
<p>three days go by and then chris was brought</p>
<p>in to the police department to be formally questioned</p>
<p>this is where chris</p>
<p>finally admits to</p>
<p>investigators that he was having an affair with aaron</p>
<p>but he swore</p>
<p>up and down that it was only on an emotional</p>
<p>level and they</p>
<p>never went past kissing</p>
<p>investigators were like so you guys aren&rsquo;t having you</p>
<p>know sex and chris</p>
<p>just said no</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve only kissed</p>
<p>which was a bold face lie</p>
<p>the questioning between chris and police goes on for</p>
<p>about three hours</p>
<p>and then police decide to change</p>
<p>tactics and</p>
<p>start a more</p>
<p>aggressive type</p>
<p>of questioning</p>
<p>not even questioning it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they just like tell you lies</p>
<p>to get you to confess you know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal but they</p>
<p>freaking do that and they trap you but it works so</p>
<p>anyways what i&rsquo;m getting at is</p>
<p>police are telling chris that</p>
<p>they knew he met with</p>
<p>aaron that morning she went missing</p>
<p>and they call</p>
<p>him out on being one of the last people to see</p>
<p>aaron alive</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t a lie</p>
<p>but it was kind</p>
<p>of exaggerated because they didn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>that so they&rsquo;re saying this in hopes that chris kind of</p>
<p>starts talking but</p>
<p>chris doesn&rsquo;t give in to</p>
<p>those questions and he tells police that</p>
<p>he did not see her that saturday morning</p>
<p>and then cops they push back harder</p>
<p>telling him that he knew she was pregnant with his</p>
<p>child chris once</p>
<p>again just holds his ground</p>
<p>deny deny deny</p>
<p>and says she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pregnant with my baby there&rsquo;s no way like you&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>lying over and over to police</p>
<p>and they know that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lying but chris isn&rsquo;t budging at this point they</p>
<p>strongly believe that</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s case isn&rsquo;t a missing</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s case but it&rsquo;s now a homicide investigation</p>
<p>and chris is at the top</p>
<p>of their possible</p>
<p>suspects list</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s all sorts of suspicious</p>
<p>like come on</p>
<p>but at this</p>
<p>point they really don&rsquo;t have any evidence proving</p>
<p>that he did anything so they can&rsquo;t arrest him yet</p>
<p>yet to be honest i&rsquo;m not sure why chris&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>nicole wasn&rsquo;t high on the possible suspect list</p>
<p>because she did threaten to kill aaron</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s okay because</p>
<p>maybe she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>involved police are believing that chris is</p>
<p>their man though because he has a motive</p>
<p>a possible baby with his mistress</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s pregnancy</p>
<p>getting out</p>
<p>and like ruining whatever was left of his already rocky</p>
<p>marriage right</p>
<p>they knew he had a</p>
<p>rifle that he was taking with him to go coyote hunting</p>
<p>and the fact that he was</p>
<p>going out to joshua tree</p>
<p>alone the same day</p>
<p>aaron went missing</p>
<p>he may have</p>
<p>had plenty of time to do whatever it was he was doing</p>
<p>if you know what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying plus the fact that police knew chris was</p>
<p>lying to them</p>
<p>about the affair</p>
<p>honestly all signs are</p>
<p>pointing to you chris</p>
<p>sorry you know</p>
<p>they just needed to actually get him to confess though</p>
<p>or some kind of evidence</p>
<p>proving that this was true now</p>
<p>investigators are</p>
<p>worried that chris</p>
<p>might try and make a run for it</p>
<p>you know cause he hasn&rsquo;t been arrested</p>
<p>yet so they&rsquo;re looking for any reason to make an arrest</p>
<p>so when investigators</p>
<p>find out that chris owned a potato gun</p>
<p>they were excited</p>
<p>oh yes a potato gun yep</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered an explosive</p>
<p>and illegal in the</p>
<p>state of california</p>
<p>so after you know they got this information they</p>
<p>went to find chris because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be arrested</p>
<p>so police go out locate chris and they arrest him but</p>
<p>chris isn&rsquo;t in jail long</p>
<p>so chris lawyers up</p>
<p>and he makes bail pretty quickly</p>
<p>but because</p>
<p>of this it gives police the ability to tell him not to</p>
<p>leave town so he can&rsquo;t go to alaska like he was</p>
<p>planning you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they fear</p>
<p>so meanwhile the police are searching</p>
<p>every square inch of joshua tree looking for aaron</p>
<p>they end up</p>
<p>covering like</p>
<p>1200 square miles</p>
<p>and they even have six different law enforcement</p>
<p>agencies and hundreds of volunteers</p>
<p>covering the ground helping look for her</p>
<p>so the searching goes</p>
<p>on for weeks and police can&rsquo;t seem to find a single</p>
<p>trace of aaron</p>
<p>now keep it in mind it&rsquo;s summer</p>
<p>joshua tree is in the desert of california</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hot as</p>
<p>balls out there i&rsquo;m talking like</p>
<p>120 degrees you know</p>
<p>so these poor</p>
<p>search parties</p>
<p>they are sweaty exhausted</p>
<p>and trying their best to just not get dehydrated</p>
<p>anyways so after two</p>
<p>months of looking</p>
<p>authorities they make the very difficult decision</p>
<p>that saturday august sixteenth</p>
<p>twenty fourteen</p>
<p>would be their</p>
<p>final day of</p>
<p>searching for aaron</p>
<p>just nothing just no sign</p>
<p>as luck would have it</p>
<p>the woman running the rescue</p>
<p>horse ranch</p>
<p>where aaron and chris volunteered at</p>
<p>she came across some</p>
<p>photos some very unusual</p>
<p>photos that chris</p>
<p>had taken i</p>
<p>guess like a week before</p>
<p>aaron disappeared</p>
<p>chris had gone around and taken some</p>
<p>photos of some abandoned mines</p>
<p>now this was concerning</p>
<p>and this woman she turned in the</p>
<p>photos to police who then</p>
<p>brought it to a</p>
<p>local cave and mine</p>
<p>expert who was able</p>
<p>to determine</p>
<p>where exactly</p>
<p>these photos were</p>
<p>taken okay a</p>
<p>break you know</p>
<p>so the search and rescue team they head</p>
<p>to these abandoned mine</p>
<p>shafts in a remote</p>
<p>area of the high desert near joshua tree national park</p>
<p>and just right outside of the 29</p>
<p>palms marine corp base where</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s husband was stationed the crew goes to one mine</p>
<p>shaft where they</p>
<p>lower a camera down into the mine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where they find</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>laying hidden</p>
<p>140 feet at</p>
<p>the bottom of this abandoned mineshaft yeah</p>
<p>jeez so the investigation at the</p>
<p>crime scene was</p>
<p>able to give some insight into what happened to erin</p>
<p>they see that</p>
<p>wrapped around her neck was a homemade</p>
<p>grot a fancy word for like a weapon that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>handheld and made of chain rope</p>
<p>wire or fishing line</p>
<p>and is used to strangle a person</p>
<p>yeah that is a fancy word</p>
<p>she was strangled okay</p>
<p>so this leads investigators to conclude that</p>
<p>aaron was strangled to</p>
<p>death before she was</p>
<p>dropped down into this mine shaft</p>
<p>at the bottom of the mine</p>
<p>shaft they find other</p>
<p>pieces of evidence</p>
<p>police found</p>
<p>rifle shots around the body</p>
<p>and a propane tank</p>
<p>tied to her</p>
<p>now this was suggesting</p>
<p>to police that the killer attempted to burn her body</p>
<p>by shooting the propane tank</p>
<p>but luckily this person had a bad shot</p>
<p>i guess because it wasn&rsquo;t successful</p>
<p>they also found</p>
<p>a little like homemade</p>
<p>torch made up of a marine corp shirt</p>
<p>wrapped around a</p>
<p>stick which</p>
<p>it was sent to be tested for dna and</p>
<p>ta da guess what</p>
<p>chris&rsquo;s dna</p>
<p>all over it but if that wasn&rsquo;t enough there was one</p>
<p>other piece of evidence at the bottom of that mine</p>
<p>shaft that confirmed chris&rsquo;s involvement</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>sprite bottle with a cap</p>
<p>still on it</p>
<p>and they sent it away to be tested for dna</p>
<p>and it came back with two different</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s dna on it</p>
<p>aaron and chriss</p>
<p>mm hmm this was like</p>
<p>the hardcore evidence that cops needed to finally</p>
<p>arrest chris and charge him with</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>and a special charge of</p>
<p>lying in wait</p>
<p>which i had</p>
<p>never heard of but when they go to arrest him</p>
<p>chris is nowhere to be found nene</p>
<p>he was gone</p>
<p>vanished you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>stick around</p>
<p>of course not</p>
<p>oh get this though</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s body was sent off to the corners</p>
<p>and when the report came back</p>
<p>it was confirmed that</p>
<p>aaron was actually</p>
<p>not pregnant</p>
<p>now nobody really knows like</p>
<p>the wind the what the</p>
<p>where the how of all of it but many thought that</p>
<p>maybe aaron was</p>
<p>lying to chris</p>
<p>in hopes that he</p>
<p>would stay in</p>
<p>the relationship or just stay with her in general</p>
<p>am i saying this is the case</p>
<p>no but it was mentioned</p>
<p>does this mean she deserved any of this no</p>
<p>absolutely not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just unfortunate to think that</p>
<p>maybe this lie</p>
<p>might have accelerated the</p>
<p>whole situation you know</p>
<p>like that sucks</p>
<p>and maybe she actually thought she was pregnant though</p>
<p>so after some</p>
<p>searching police are able to locate chris</p>
<p>chris his wife nicole</p>
<p>and their daughter</p>
<p>liberty had indeed</p>
<p>moved to alaska as they originally</p>
<p>planned now chris was told to stay put</p>
<p>he obviously didn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass bye</p>
<p>you know fuck that guy anyway</p>
<p>they head up to alaska and they are able</p>
<p>to arrest chris</p>
<p>and when they</p>
<p>search his car the cops discover</p>
<p>more evidence confirming that they indeed have the</p>
<p>right guy when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching chris&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone and computer</p>
<p>they find google</p>
<p>searches on how to dispose of a body</p>
<p>and in his car they</p>
<p>found the grote</p>
<p>i hope i&rsquo;m probably not saying that groot</p>
<p>i like the one that was</p>
<p>found wrapped around</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s neck</p>
<p>again just really</p>
<p>sealing the deal that chris was indeed</p>
<p>involved no ifs ants</p>
<p>or buts hmm no</p>
<p>this is a side note but i couldn&rsquo;t help but</p>
<p>think this is</p>
<p>whole time have you ever noticed</p>
<p>that the new</p>
<p>age killers name is usually chris</p>
<p>and there always seems to be a nicole</p>
<p>close by can you</p>
<p>think of some</p>
<p>other cases</p>
<p>where that may be the case</p>
<p>because i most certainly can</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just kidding but like i noticed that because</p>
<p>chris and nicole</p>
<p>remember like chris watts and his</p>
<p>lover nicole</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know just i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it means anything but i couldn&rsquo;t help but notice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all anyways</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s arrested</p>
<p>sitting in jail waiting for</p>
<p>trial trial</p>
<p>begins and the prosecution shows</p>
<p>their evidence</p>
<p>supporting their belief that chris lured</p>
<p>aaron into the desert</p>
<p>and killed her</p>
<p>to hide the affair that was</p>
<p>still going on between them</p>
<p>but not only that the fact that</p>
<p>aaron was pregnant as well</p>
<p>one of the witnesses they put on the</p>
<p>stand was the owner of the rescue</p>
<p>horse ranch</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>woman who turned in the</p>
<p>pictures that helped them find aaron</p>
<p>yeah so she went on record saying that she</p>
<p>spoke to nicole</p>
<p>chris&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>right after</p>
<p>aaron went missing</p>
<p>and that nicole seemed</p>
<p>super uptight</p>
<p>i guess whatever that means nicole</p>
<p>ended up telling the</p>
<p>this woman that</p>
<p>she had wished</p>
<p>aaron was dead and she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t care if</p>
<p>aaron was dead not a good look nicole you know</p>
<p>and then nicole said something super</p>
<p>suspicious she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no body there&rsquo;s no case</p>
<p>we knew nicole</p>
<p>was pissed but was she pissed</p>
<p>off enough to actually follow through with that threat</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you know like i</p>
<p>think a lot of times when you&rsquo;re really angry</p>
<p>you say something like oh my god i</p>
<p>would i&rsquo;m gonna kill him i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna kill her whatever like</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re mad but you don&rsquo;t actually mean it</p>
<p>and then in cases like this</p>
<p>would you imagine if you said that and then</p>
<p>that person</p>
<p>actually died and you&rsquo;re like oh shit like you know</p>
<p>so maybe that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>but no anyways</p>
<p>so the ranch owner also told the court</p>
<p>about how chris and she were having some</p>
<p>small talk i wish i</p>
<p>could talk i can&rsquo;t even talk</p>
<p>where chris went on</p>
<p>to tell her that he had done some exploring around and</p>
<p>found a certain mine</p>
<p>shaft that nobody would find</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s telling this to the owner of the horse</p>
<p>and then he was all</p>
<p>super casual and</p>
<p>asked her like hey</p>
<p>can i borrow your</p>
<p>propane tank i want to use it to play some games</p>
<p>for some reason the owner</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t think anything of</p>
<p>it and she she gave him a propane tank is that a thing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try that</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t try that</p>
<p>sounds very dangerous</p>
<p>fires we don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>the prosecution</p>
<p>also brings in a criminalist</p>
<p>who testifies that the firing pin markings on a 22</p>
<p>caliber bullet</p>
<p>casing which was</p>
<p>found near the same mine</p>
<p>where aaron&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>found it matched</p>
<p>the rifle that chris had left back at the</p>
<p>ranch it&rsquo;s really not looking over you chris</p>
<p>but then on november 4th</p>
<p>2016 the trial takes</p>
<p>an unexpected turn</p>
<p>while chris is on the</p>
<p>stand the prosecutor</p>
<p>asked chris</p>
<p>if he was the person who strangled</p>
<p>aaron and it was like a bomb went off in the</p>
<p>courtroom ca</p>
<p>boomy you know chris replied with</p>
<p>three little words that just turn this</p>
<p>whole case upside down</p>
<p>those three words you ask well</p>
<p>it was a confession</p>
<p>well he said yes i am</p>
<p>those were the</p>
<p>three words yes i am</p>
<p>the one who strangled her</p>
<p>so great but this</p>
<p>threw everybody off like why is he all of a</p>
<p>sudden confessing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the game plan with this move you&rsquo;re doing sir so</p>
<p>chris goes on to tell the</p>
<p>court that he indeed</p>
<p>strangled aaron in a fit of rage</p>
<p>but now that he had time to calm down and really</p>
<p>think about his actions</p>
<p>he wanted to come</p>
<p>clean and do the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>i just want to be the good guy</p>
<p>he told the</p>
<p>court that at</p>
<p>first he was afraid to tell the</p>
<p>truth but also in the back of his mind he was</p>
<p>thinking that he</p>
<p>could possibly get away with it</p>
<p>he admitted to</p>
<p>still being very</p>
<p>angry at the time so he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to find her</p>
<p>but then he</p>
<p>went on to say that he&rsquo;s no longer afraid to tell the</p>
<p>truth and that he</p>
<p>wanted to let everyone know what he did</p>
<p>and would accept the punishment that they gave him</p>
<p>which sounds like okay</p>
<p>great you know</p>
<p>but hold on</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s got a little plan up his sleeve</p>
<p>so chris calmly tells the superior</p>
<p>court what went down the</p>
<p>night aaron died chris said that he took</p>
<p>aaron out to the desert near</p>
<p>joshua tree national park for a surprise</p>
<p>instead of a romantic</p>
<p>surprise proposal like</p>
<p>aaron thought was happening</p>
<p>they ended up outside of mine</p>
<p>where they start to</p>
<p>argue chris explains that he told aaron</p>
<p>that he was moving to alaska</p>
<p>and that their relationship was</p>
<p>over aaron was</p>
<p>super upset</p>
<p>she was like i</p>
<p>still love you i</p>
<p>wanna be with you i</p>
<p>could go to alaska with you i just want</p>
<p>to be a part of you and your</p>
<p>child&rsquo;s life begging him to stay and chris</p>
<p>says that this makes some very mad for some reason</p>
<p>and yells at her like</p>
<p>leave my daughter out of this this is my daughter</p>
<p>just like getting</p>
<p>super angry that</p>
<p>she mentioned his</p>
<p>daughter and for some reason</p>
<p>her mentioning</p>
<p>caring about his</p>
<p>daughter just really</p>
<p>triggered something deep in him so chris is</p>
<p>super pissed and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming at aaron</p>
<p>and then out of nowhere out of the blue he</p>
<p>asked aaron</p>
<p>if she had been molesting his</p>
<p>daughter wait</p>
<p>what really</p>
<p>he thinks she</p>
<p>was molesting his kid this is what he&rsquo;s telling the</p>
<p>court mind you but then it gets worse</p>
<p>he says that aaron</p>
<p>admits to it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;mma take a little</p>
<p>pause here and say that in my personal opinion</p>
<p>i believe that chris was</p>
<p>lying because he wanted to give</p>
<p>a valid reason as to why he got so</p>
<p>angry and strangled</p>
<p>slash murdered her i am sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking the same</p>
<p>thing but i just wanted to make that clear so</p>
<p>chris is telling the</p>
<p>court that aaron was actually molesting her</p>
<p>and everyone was just supposed to believe it</p>
<p>i guess there no</p>
<p>proof he just said</p>
<p>says it chris goes on to tell the</p>
<p>court that one</p>
<p>night after nicole had given</p>
<p>their baby a bath</p>
<p>she noticed that the little girls</p>
<p>lower area was red and</p>
<p>irritated earlier that day</p>
<p>aaron had been babysitting</p>
<p>the the kid so chris said that</p>
<p>the more he thought</p>
<p>about the situation</p>
<p>the more like the gears were turning in his head</p>
<p>so at the mine he confronted her and was like did you</p>
<p>touch my daughter did you molest my daughter</p>
<p>and chris said that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>aaron confessed to molesting his daughter</p>
<p>and he was just</p>
<p>shocked he was so</p>
<p>shocked he was just</p>
<p>shocked and</p>
<p>angry and in</p>
<p>that moment he made the decision to kill her he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still trying</p>
<p>he is still</p>
<p>trying to get out of this</p>
<p>chris told the</p>
<p>court that he was controlled by the anger</p>
<p>and he then</p>
<p>went on to say that it was something he</p>
<p>never wanted to</p>
<p>experience again</p>
<p>chris told the</p>
<p>court he then approached</p>
<p>erin from behind and he strangled her for at</p>
<p>least five minutes</p>
<p>and when he released his hold she fell to the ground</p>
<p>and then after 30 seconds of</p>
<p>searching for any signs of life chris was confident</p>
<p>that she was</p>
<p>dead he then</p>
<p>dragged her body to the mine</p>
<p>shaft and pushed aaron</p>
<p>into it head first</p>
<p>so during chris&rsquo;s testimony</p>
<p>his attorney</p>
<p>briefly questioned</p>
<p>him with the sole purpose of emphasizing that</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s death was not premeditated</p>
<p>but the district attorney was</p>
<p>focusing on chris&rsquo;s lies he told to investigators</p>
<p>and not admitting responsibility</p>
<p>until he was in</p>
<p>court and in</p>
<p>front of an audience</p>
<p>so the da accused chris</p>
<p>of wanting the attention and making</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>about him he also accuses chris of</p>
<p>spinning a story</p>
<p>about this molestation of his daughter</p>
<p>as a way to get sympathy</p>
<p>from the jury which</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hoping it</p>
<p>would give him like a lesser charge</p>
<p>maybe involuntary manslaughter</p>
<p>but nene chris</p>
<p>no one believed you the jury saw</p>
<p>right through your dumbass</p>
<p>and it only took them</p>
<p>about 15 minutes to come back with the verdict</p>
<p>he was convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>and on tuesday november 29th 2016</p>
<p>he was sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>without parole</p>
<p>bye bye at chris&rsquo;s sentencing hearing</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s mother she read a</p>
<p>statement to the court</p>
<p>about how she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why</p>
<p>anyone would</p>
<p>think murderer was okay</p>
<p>she said if chris wanted to get rid of his problems all</p>
<p>he had to do was move to alaska and change his number</p>
<p>like why did you have to kill her</p>
<p>john remember the husband</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s husband he gave little</p>
<p>statements and interviews and stuff</p>
<p>there was one interview he gave</p>
<p>where he said that he hated like the actions that chris</p>
<p>chose but he had to forgive him</p>
<p>because if he</p>
<p>still held onto that hatred it was just</p>
<p>gonna pull him down</p>
<p>which is like really big of them</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so quiet i hope he&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that had to be</p>
<p>freaking hard</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t given many interviews or made any</p>
<p>statements and he&rsquo;s just all around a pretty</p>
<p>quiet guy and that&rsquo;s probably for the better</p>
<p>hope he&rsquo;s doing all</p>
<p>right during all of this nicole</p>
<p>chris&rsquo;s wife she stayed out of the public eye</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t there for chris&rsquo;s sentencing</p>
<p>at chris&rsquo;s sentencing he did address the court</p>
<p>he confessed to killing his</p>
<p>girlfriend to save humanity</p>
<p>god but he did apologize to</p>
<p>aaron&rsquo;s friends and family for the hurt and pain</p>
<p>that he had</p>
<p>caused them</p>
<p>saying that he didn&rsquo;t want to kill</p>
<p>aaron and he didn&rsquo;t plan on it but</p>
<p>weirdly even after confessing and</p>
<p>being found guilty he</p>
<p>still continue to</p>
<p>stick with the same</p>
<p>story he still has been saying</p>
<p>that this is what happened christopher lee is now 31</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s incarcerated at the</p>
<p>california institution for men</p>
<p>a state prison located in chino</p>
<p>san bernardino county</p>
<p>as per his sentencing the ex marine</p>
<p>will spend the rest of his natural life behind bars</p>
<p>good honestly like this is</p>
<p>tragic i feel like you hear stories like this</p>
<p>whole time in</p>
<p>2020 dateline all that</p>
<p>stuff where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>somebody cheats</p>
<p>things get messy</p>
<p>and somebody gets murdered but with this one that chris</p>
<p>he was very dramatic</p>
<p>okay the fact that he put her in a mine</p>
<p>shaft the propane tank</p>
<p>like come on</p>
<p>something loose in his head so i&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>he got caught because that&rsquo;s terrifying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care what you have to say if someone</p>
<p>cheats or whatever they don&rsquo;t deserve to die so</p>
<p>if i see comments like that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna shut down tell you to shut the fuck up</p>
<p>roundhouse kick you to the face because look</p>
<p>yes she had an affair whatever</p>
<p>but no one deserves to die over an affair so i just</p>
<p>it never fails</p>
<p>i always see comments like that like no she deserved it</p>
<p>no she didn&rsquo;t i wish this had like a happier ending</p>
<p>right this whole case is just</p>
<p>super horrible not only does this guy</p>
<p>kill his girlfriend</p>
<p>girlfriend with his baby</p>
<p>but he then accuses her of being a</p>
<p>child molester</p>
<p>knowing that she can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand up for herself how</p>
<p>dare you that&rsquo;s very jody</p>
<p>areas of you</p>
<p>freaking terrible</p>
<p>human i hope you rot</p>
<p>goodbye you won&rsquo;t be missed</p>
<p>chris anyways i</p>
<p>would love to hear your guys</p>
<p>thoughts down below</p>
<p>i mean what can we say really anywho</p>
<p>i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>let me know</p>
<p>down in the comment section who you want me to talk</p>
<p>about next time</p>
