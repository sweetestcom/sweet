    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking all about hormones,</p>
<p>these incredible chemicals that can impact our mood,</p>
<p>our behavior, our feelings of optimism or pessimism.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about hormones</p>
<p>is that hormones impact all those things,</p>
<p>but all those things,</p>
<p>how we feel and what we do and what we think</p>
<p>also can impact our hormones.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really fascinating area of biology</p>
<p>that impacts every single one of us every day,</p>
<p>both in wakefulness and in sleep</p>
<p>and throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to be talking about hormone optimization,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re mainly going to be focusing</p>
<p>on estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.</p>
<p>Last episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we talked about sexual development.</p>
<p>That is how the chromosomes, the gonads and hormones</p>
<p>impact what we call sexual development,</p>
<p>leading all the way up to puberty.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re mainly going to talk about processes</p>
<p>that happen from puberty onward,</p>
<p>although we might talk a little bit</p>
<p>about development as well.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about basic biology,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to weave in a lot of practical tools</p>
<p>along the way for how to optimize</p>
<p>these incredibly powerful things that we call hormones.</p>
<p>Before we dive into our discussion</p>
<p>about hormone optimization,</p>
<p>I want to raise what I think is a very important point</p>
<p>that at least I hadn&rsquo;t heard of until recently,</p>
<p>which is the concept of salutogenesis.</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis,</p>
<p>the idea that there are all these scary diseases</p>
<p>like dementia and heart disease and stroke</p>
<p>and all these things that await us</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t take good care of ourselves</p>
<p>and that might await us even if we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pathogenic model.</p>
<p>Salutogenesis is something I learned about</p>
<p>from one of my Stanford Medicine colleagues,</p>
<p>which is a different orientation</p>
<p>toward health and well-being</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re taking on particular behaviors,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking on a particular stance</p>
<p>towards nutrition and exercise, supplementation, et cetera,</p>
<p>in order to promote well-being</p>
<p>above where you would be</p>
<p>if you were not doing those behaviors.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about these two things,</p>
<p>salutogenesis and the pathogenic model</p>
<p>are really two sides of the same coin,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just give an example</p>
<p>of how this might affect you in a real way.</p>
<p>If you like exercise because it feels good, great,</p>
<p>but many people exercise or eat well for that matter</p>
<p>in order to avoid heart disease or to avoid dementia,</p>
<p>to avoid negative changes in body composition.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s powerful and certainly is the case</p>
<p>that exercise will help you move away from all those things,</p>
<p>the salutogenesis model differs in that</p>
<p>it involves a mindset and an orientation</p>
<p>towards doing those things in order to feel good,</p>
<p>in order to enhance your level of energy,</p>
<p>in order to improve endocrine function</p>
<p>and metabolic function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really part of the pathogenic model,</p>
<p>and yet salutogenesis is really more of a mindset</p>
<p>toward why you would do these particular behaviors.</p>
<p>And really the most powerful mindset</p>
<p>is going to be one where you are thinking</p>
<p>about the pathogenic model,</p>
<p>doing things so that you don&rsquo;t end up sick, et cetera,</p>
<p>and to move away from sickness,</p>
<p>as well as the salutogenic model</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>in order to move towards health and well-being.</p>
<p>We think of health and wellness nowadays</p>
<p>or the wellness community or wellness practices.</p>
<p>And in many ways,</p>
<p>that is the essence of the salutogenic model.</p>
<p>But I found it very interesting to know</p>
<p>that within the field of allopathic medicine,</p>
<p>these two models exist,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t hear about the salutogenic model</p>
<p>quite as often.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just something to keep in mind,</p>
<p>especially because of some of the mindset effects</p>
<p>that were discussed in previous episodes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into these in detail again right now,</p>
<p>but if you might recall from the episode on food and mood,</p>
<p>we talked about some of these incredible studies</p>
<p>that were done by Aaliyah Crum&rsquo;s group at Stanford</p>
<p>and others,</p>
<p>showing that if you tell people</p>
<p>that the behavior that they&rsquo;re about to do,</p>
<p>in this case, it was people cleaning up hotel rooms</p>
<p>because that was their job.</p>
<p>If you tell them that it&rsquo;s good for them,</p>
<p>then you see much greater positive health effects</p>
<p>than if they aren&rsquo;t aware of that information,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s good for them.</p>
<p>So we should really be thinking about</p>
<p>not just moving away from disease and negative things,</p>
<p>but also why certain things are good for us</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s well-established now</p>
<p>from really good scientific studies</p>
<p>that keeping in mind the positive effects of things</p>
<p>can really have an outsized effect on wellbeing</p>
<p>right down to the level of our physiology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about hormone optimization.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about hormone optimization</p>
<p>in reference to estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>and their derivatives.</p>
<p>Now, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives</p>
<p>are what we call sex steroids.</p>
<p>Now, the sex steroids immediately call to mind sex</p>
<p>for obvious reasons and steroids,</p>
<p>meaning anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>But I just want to emphasize that estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>are present in everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their ratios that determine their effects.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how you can optimize the ratios</p>
<p>depending on your particular life goals</p>
<p>because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>in every individual has profound influence</p>
<p>on feelings of wellbeing, feelings of optimism,</p>
<p>feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety,</p>
<p>on reproduction, on sexual behavior,</p>
<p>independent of reproduction.</p>
<p>They are profoundly powerful molecules</p>
<p>and we all make these molecules to some degree or another,</p>
<p>but there are also important behavioral tools,</p>
<p>supplementation tools, as well as prescription drugs</p>
<p>that can impact the ratios of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in really powerful ways.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to cover all of that.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that when you hear sex steroids</p>
<p>or steroid hormones,</p>
<p>most people think about anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>And of course, anabolic steroids</p>
<p>are derivatives of testosterone or testosterone itself.</p>
<p>And they are heavily used and abused in the sports community</p>
<p>as well as outside the sports community.</p>
<p>But there of course are many steroids</p>
<p>that are not anabolic steroids</p>
<p>that are also abused in sports.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re not talking about drugs in sports,</p>
<p>but I think that it carries such a heavy weight</p>
<p>when people hear the word steroids,</p>
<p>they think about anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>So while today&rsquo;s discussion will certainly be relevant</p>
<p>to physical performance,</p>
<p>in fact, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how specific types of exercise,</p>
<p>particular patterns of cold exposure,</p>
<p>as well as particular patterns, believe it or not,</p>
<p>of breathing can impact sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>both estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>The discussion isn&rsquo;t really geared</p>
<p>towards performance enhancement in sport,</p>
<p>although we will do an entire episode,</p>
<p>perhaps even an entire month</p>
<p>related to performance enhancement in physical enterprises.</p>
<p>So one of the first things to understand</p>
<p>if you want to optimize your hormones</p>
<p>is where they come from.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different glands in the body</p>
<p>that produce hormones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the pineal gland.</p>
<p>Some hormones are made in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Hormones are made by the gonads,</p>
<p>the ovaries or the testes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of different glands</p>
<p>that make these different hormones.</p>
<p>But when we&rsquo;re talking about the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>the major sources are ovaries for estrogen</p>
<p>and the testes for testosterone,</p>
<p>although the adrenals can also make testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, there are also some enzymes.</p>
<p>Enzymes are things that can change chemical composition.</p>
<p>And the enzymes that we&rsquo;re going to talk about today</p>
<p>are the aromatases mainly.</p>
<p>The aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen.</p>
<p>So in a male, for instance,</p>
<p>that has very high testosterone,</p>
<p>some of that is going to be converted into estrogen</p>
<p>by aromatase.</p>
<p>And aromatase is made by body fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also made in the testes themselves.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but the testes actually have the capacity</p>
<p>to manufacture estrogen and aromatase,</p>
<p>albeit at low levels.</p>
<p>But this turns out to be important</p>
<p>for optimizing hormone levels in males at later points.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll discuss that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that there&rsquo;s a huge range</p>
<p>in terms of the levels of hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone, and estrogen between individuals.</p>
<p>And it actually occurs within individuals</p>
<p>across the lifespan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to throw out specific numbers</p>
<p>of X picograms per deciliter, et cetera, today,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to vary a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on whether or not you&rsquo;re measuring</p>
<p>in picograms or nanograms and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you want to examine your hormones,</p>
<p>you should do that in conjunction with a medical doctor.</p>
<p>Ideally, an endocrinologist can help you</p>
<p>sort out that information.</p>
<p>But the important thing to know</p>
<p>is that prepubescent females</p>
<p>make very little estrogen.</p>
<p>And when we talk about estrogen,</p>
<p>we mainly talk about estradiol,</p>
<p>which is the most active form of estrogen</p>
<p>in both males and females.</p>
<p>So prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen.</p>
<p>During puberty, levels of estrogen, aka estradiol,</p>
<p>basically skyrocket.</p>
<p>And then across the lifespan,</p>
<p>estrogen is going to vary</p>
<p>depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>But as one heads into menopause,</p>
<p>which typically takes place nowadays</p>
<p>somewhere between age 45 and 60,</p>
<p>levels of estrogen are going to drop</p>
<p>and then post-menopause levels of estrogen are very low.</p>
<p>As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan.</p>
<p>Testosterone is going to be relatively low</p>
<p>pre-puberty in males.</p>
<p>During puberty, it&rsquo;s going to skyrocket.</p>
<p>And then the current numbers are that it drops off</p>
<p>at about a rate of 1% per year.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;re going to talk about some data</p>
<p>that show that there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>tremendous variation in testosterone levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of examples of men in their 90s,</p>
<p>who still have testosterone levels</p>
<p>that mimic pubertal levels, which is remarkable</p>
<p>and speaks to the huge variation</p>
<p>in testosterone levels across individuals.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about other sources of these hormones.</p>
<p>And then it will make clear what avenues</p>
<p>you might want to take in order to optimize these hormones.</p>
<p>The other glands and tissues in the body</p>
<p>that make these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals.</p>
<p>So the adrenals ride up top the kidneys.</p>
<p>And the release of these steroid hormones from the adrenals,</p>
<p>in particular testosterone</p>
<p>and some of its related derivatives,</p>
<p>are mainly activated by competition.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about competition,</p>
<p>because it turns out that competition</p>
<p>is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And the sex steroid hormones powerfully influence</p>
<p>competition.</p>
<p>So most people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but most males of a given mammalian species</p>
<p>never get to reproduce.</p>
<p>In fact, they never even get to have sex at all.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t often think about that,</p>
<p>but testosterone plays a powerful role</p>
<p>in determining which members of a given species</p>
<p>will get to reproduce,</p>
<p>which ones of that species</p>
<p>will actually get access to females.</p>
<p>And so here I&rsquo;m not talking about humans specifically,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s well-known in species like elephant seals,</p>
<p>in species like antlered animals and rams, for instance,</p>
<p>that the higher levels of testosterone</p>
<p>correlate with access to females.</p>
<p>Now, one interpretation of this</p>
<p>is that the females are detecting</p>
<p>which males have high testosterone and selecting them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more receptive to them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about receptivity for mating</p>
<p>in a moment.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually more so</p>
<p>that the males that have higher testosterone</p>
<p>forage further and will fight harder for the females.</p>
<p>And this is really interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very good evidence now</p>
<p>that testosterone can reduce anxiety,</p>
<p>promote novelty seeking,</p>
<p>and promote competitive interactions.</p>
<p>And so before you leap too far with this in your mind</p>
<p>and think about all these human behaviors,</p>
<p>just stay with me</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a little bit of biology here</p>
<p>that makes it all make sense.</p>
<p>And it turns out to be pretty simple.</p>
<p>We have a brain region called the amygdala.</p>
<p>In Latin, that just means almond.</p>
<p>But the amygdala is most famous for its role in fear.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about fear and the amygdala.</p>
<p>But the amygdala is really involved in threat detection.</p>
<p>It sets our thresholds for anxiety</p>
<p>and what we consider scary or too much.</p>
<p>Testosterone secreted from the gonads</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the body</p>
<p>binds to the amygdala</p>
<p>and changes the threshold for stress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve said before on previous versions of this podcast</p>
<p>and on other podcasts</p>
<p>that testosterone has this incredible effect</p>
<p>of making effort feel good.</p>
<p>But what I was really referring to</p>
<p>is the fact that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety</p>
<p>in particular in males of a given species.</p>
<p>Now, this is important</p>
<p>because we often think of testosterone</p>
<p>as creating whatever, masculinization</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s virilization</p>
<p>or all these terms are thrown around.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s it really doing</p>
<p>when it comes to mate choice and competition?</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s reducing the threshold for anxiety.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>it selects individuals of a given species to push further,</p>
<p>being willing to suffer more,</p>
<p>although it also reduces pain.</p>
<p>So maybe they also suffer less</p>
<p>in pursuit of reproduction in females.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s well-known in humans</p>
<p>that both males and females</p>
<p>who have elevated levels of testosterone</p>
<p>will engage in more novelty seeking.</p>
<p>And I do want to point out</p>
<p>that even individuals without testes have testosterone</p>
<p>and peaks in testosterone have similar effects</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>someone has ovaries or testes.</p>
<p>Testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging,</p>
<p>more novelty seeking,</p>
<p>increases in libido and increases in desire to mate.</p>
<p>So it is the case that increases in testosterone</p>
<p>promote competitive and foraging type behaviors</p>
<p>in humans and in non-human mammals.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that competition itself</p>
<p>can increase androgens such as testosterone.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>Competitive environments themselves</p>
<p>can increase testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, some people have come to the conclusion</p>
<p>that if you win, your testosterone goes up.</p>
<p>And if you lose, your testosterone goes down.</p>
<p>And to some extent that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a direct effect on the gonads.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>We talked about dopamine</p>
<p>in the episode on motivation and drive.</p>
<p>And dopamine and testosterone</p>
<p>have a remarkable interplay in the body.</p>
<p>Dopamine is actually released in the brain</p>
<p>in ways that has the pituitary,</p>
<p>this gland that sits over the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>release certain hormones that then go on</p>
<p>to promote the release of more testosterone.</p>
<p>And indeed winning promotes more dopamine</p>
<p>and later more testosterone.</p>
<p>However, in the short term,</p>
<p>just competing increases testosterone</p>
<p>independent of whether or not you win or lose.</p>
<p>So the short version of this</p>
<p>is that competition increases testosterone.</p>
<p>And this may be an ancient mechanism</p>
<p>whereby the androgens such as testosterone</p>
<p>are feeding back to encourage</p>
<p>more competitive type behaviors.</p>
<p>Because every species,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about reproduction</p>
<p>or other resource allocation,</p>
<p>is involved in competition.</p>
<p>Not every individual of a species</p>
<p>gets access to the same number of mates</p>
<p>or the same quality of mates.</p>
<p>And this is true in both directions</p>
<p>for males and females and everything in between.</p>
<p>So I just want to emphasize once more</p>
<p>in case I went through it too quickly,</p>
<p>that increases in testosterone in females</p>
<p>are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior</p>
<p>or seeking out reproductive behavior.</p>
<p>They increase libido.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a particular phase of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>where testosterone peaks just before ovulation</p>
<p>that on average leads female humans</p>
<p>to seek out sex more than they would otherwise</p>
<p>during their cycle.</p>
<p>And this is all by self-report,</p>
<p>but this is also while measuring things like testosterone,</p>
<p>estrogen ratios, and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting that a single molecule,</p>
<p>regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background,</p>
<p>is increasing seeking of mates across individuals,</p>
<p>increasing desire to compete</p>
<p>or willingness to compete</p>
<p>and lowering the threshold for stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to point out</p>
<p>that while increases in testosterone</p>
<p>promote seeking of mates and reproduction</p>
<p>in both males and females,</p>
<p>in females, it&rsquo;s actually increases in estrogen</p>
<p>that promote receptivity to mating.</p>
<p>So testosterone is driving the seeking of sex</p>
<p>and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sex</p>
<p>from females, so-called receptivity,</p>
<p>consensual receptivity.</p>
<p>In males, it&rsquo;s interesting to point out</p>
<p>that testosterone is promoting seeking of sex,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also estrogen in males</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important for libido.</p>
<p>If estrogen levels are brought too low,</p>
<p>then men will completely lose their libido.</p>
<p>This is often not discussed or overlooked</p>
<p>in the discussion about testosterone therapy</p>
<p>and performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>People think that hyperandrogenized individuals,</p>
<p>meaning people that have very high levels of androgen</p>
<p>will have very high levels of libido,</p>
<p>and they will provided estrogen is available</p>
<p>in sufficient ratios to match that testosterone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not simply the case</p>
<p>that high levels of testosterone</p>
<p>produce a lot of sex and mating behavior</p>
<p>and low levels of estrogen are good across the board.</p>
<p>You actually need both in both males and females.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in females,</p>
<p>the testosterone levels are always going to be lower</p>
<p>than the estrogen levels,</p>
<p>and in males, the estrogen levels</p>
<p>are always going to be lower than testosterone levels.</p>
<p>So testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>And the real question then is,</p>
<p>does sex itself promote testosterone?</p>
<p>And the answer is somewhat complicated,</p>
<p>but the short version is yes.</p>
<p>And as you recall, sex has multiple stages.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the physical act of sex,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the seeking of sex,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s orgasm and ejaculation.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between these</p>
<p>because whether or not sex itself increases testosterone</p>
<p>depends on whether or not the male ejaculates.</p>
<p>And this is very important to understand</p>
<p>because on a previous episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned how dopamine increases with sexual activity.</p>
<p>Remember, dopamine and testosterone</p>
<p>tend to increase linearly with one another.</p>
<p>But then after ejaculation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a release of prolactin,</p>
<p>and prolactin actually sets the refractory period in males</p>
<p>during which he can&rsquo;t have sex again.</p>
<p>And the duration of the refractory period</p>
<p>will vary tremendously depending on how much</p>
<p>and how long that prolactin release occurs.</p>
<p>I also described in a previous episode</p>
<p>how some people take vitamin B6,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting anyone do this,</p>
<p>but take vitamin B6 in order to reduce prolactin levels</p>
<p>and thereby reduce the duration of the refractory period.</p>
<p>But getting at this question</p>
<p>about testosterone and sexual behavior,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to distinguish</p>
<p>between these different phases of reproduction</p>
<p>or reproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>So there are studies showing</p>
<p>that sexual behavior itself can increase testosterone.</p>
<p>There was a study published in 2011</p>
<p>from Escasa et al, E-S-C-A-S-A.</p>
<p>This is the stuff of textbooks, this is on PubMed.</p>
<p>These are quality studies showing that men who observe sex,</p>
<p>so I guess this would be observing pornography,</p>
<p>will have slight increases in testosterone</p>
<p>during the observation.</p>
<p>These people actually were willing</p>
<p>to have blood draws taken while watching pornography.</p>
<p>They had increases in testosterone</p>
<p>that were very modest of about 10%.</p>
<p>Whereas when people participated in sex,</p>
<p>they actually did this study where people had blood draws</p>
<p>and they had real sex with their partners,</p>
<p>and they had 70% increases in testosterone.</p>
<p>So there are increases in testosterone</p>
<p>that are quite significant during the physical act of sex</p>
<p>and far less so during observing sex.</p>
<p>Now, the question that I often get,</p>
<p>in fact, it&rsquo;s one of the questions I get most often</p>
<p>in the comments on YouTube, I don&rsquo;t know why that is,</p>
<p>is whether or not ejaculation adjusts testosterone levels.</p>
<p>And it turns out there are two studies that I could find</p>
<p>that were quality studies on PubMed that address this,</p>
<p>that sex and ejaculation itself</p>
<p>does not reduce testosterone levels,</p>
<p>although it will increase prolactin levels</p>
<p>for the reasons I described a moment ago.</p>
<p>However, abstinence or sex without ejaculation</p>
<p>for a week or more will increase testosterone levels</p>
<p>up to 400%.</p>
<p>So the answer is actually complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not straightforward.</p>
<p>What it means is that sex itself increases testosterone.</p>
<p>However, abstinence also increases testosterone even further.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a nuanced answer.</p>
<p>And I hope this is satisfactory, no pun intended,</p>
<p>to those of you that have been asking me</p>
<p>what is the relationship between sex and ejaculation</p>
<p>and testosterone and dopamine?</p>
<p>It is nuanced.</p>
<p>And you have to understand that nuance</p>
<p>if you want to understand how certain behaviors</p>
<p>impact hormones and how hormones impact those behaviors.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, in females,</p>
<p>testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out sex.</p>
<p>And sex itself also increases testosterone,</p>
<p>but it also increases prolactin.</p>
<p>So in both men and women,</p>
<p>sex increases prolactin post-sex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way that the system works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that testosterone and dopamine increase</p>
<p>in the seeking out and the behavior of sex.</p>
<p>And then after sex, prolactin levels go up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of a quiescence.</p>
<p>The whole nervous system is promoted towards calm.</p>
<p>And this may actually have something to do with pair bonding</p>
<p>and the encouragement of individuals</p>
<p>to spend more time together,</p>
<p>to exchange different smells and hormones</p>
<p>and maybe even pheromones.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about pheromones in a moment.</p>
<p>A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about the hormone DHEA,</p>
<p>which is mainly made by the adrenals.</p>
<p>DHEA has been promoted as kind of a catch-all</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in males and females.</p>
<p>And indeed, DHEA will increase</p>
<p>both testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>This is something to be mindful of</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking about taking DHEA</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking DHEA already.</p>
<p>DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And the extent to which it increases one or the other</p>
<p>will depend on whether or not you&rsquo;re starting off</p>
<p>with more estrogen than testosterone</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re starting off</p>
<p>with more testosterone than estrogen</p>
<p>and whether or not you have a lot of aromatase.</p>
<p>So for individuals that have a lot of aromatase</p>
<p>being made by the testes or by body fat,</p>
<p>if you take DHEA, there&rsquo;s a good chance</p>
<p>that a fair portion of that</p>
<p>is going to be shuttled towards estrogen production</p>
<p>and not towards testosterone production.</p>
<p>Whereas in individuals that have low levels of testosterone</p>
<p>to begin with, high levels of estrogen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance that the DHEA</p>
<p>is going to promote mainly estrogen production.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what I could find</p>
<p>from the research studies that I examined.</p>
<p>So the way to think about DHEA,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a kind of global promoter of the sex steroid hormones</p>
<p>and its specific effects are going to depend a little bit</p>
<p>on where you started</p>
<p>and whether or not you have ovaries or testes.</p>
<p>So just as there are behaviors</p>
<p>that can increase testosterone,</p>
<p>there are behaviors that can decrease testosterone.</p>
<p>And one of the most well-characterized ones in humans</p>
<p>is becoming a parent.</p>
<p>So expecting fathers have an almost 50% decrease</p>
<p>in testosterone levels, both free and bound testosterone.</p>
<p>As well, their cortisol levels, a stress hormone,</p>
<p>drop by almost threefold, which is incredible.</p>
<p>And their estradiol levels double.</p>
<p>So their estrogen levels double.</p>
<p>So expecting fathers, many people have known,</p>
<p>put on additional body weight.</p>
<p>Everyone always thought that it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>in parallel with their pregnant wife.</p>
<p>But it turns out that these effects of reduced testosterone,</p>
<p>increased estradiol and reduced cortisol</p>
<p>can all be explained by an increase in prolactin.</p>
<p>So not just in humans, but in other species as well,</p>
<p>when the male and female of that species are expecting young,</p>
<p>they lay down more body fat.</p>
<p>The assumption is that this is to prepare</p>
<p>for long nights of no sleep,</p>
<p>which occurs in many species, not just in humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting that this hormone prolactin</p>
<p>can start suppressing whole categories of hormones,</p>
<p>sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>and can start increasing whole categories of other ones.</p>
<p>So we hear about the dad bod.</p>
<p>There are a lot of explanations for the dad bod</p>
<p>that extend well beyond this podcast episode.</p>
<p>But it is a well-known phenomenon</p>
<p>that testosterone is going to drop,</p>
<p>prolactin is going to increase,</p>
<p>estradiol is going to increase in males and females</p>
<p>that are expecting children.</p>
<p>Now, how long that lasts is very interesting.</p>
<p>It actually has to do with how much contact</p>
<p>and how much contact with the smells of the baby,</p>
<p>of the offspring the father happens to have.</p>
<p>So how available or unavailable he is</p>
<p>will actually impact his level of hormones.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m definitely not promoting the idea</p>
<p>that fathers or mothers take time away</p>
<p>from their offspring</p>
<p>in order to keep their testosterone levels high</p>
<p>or to restore them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting to point out</p>
<p>that these evolutionary mechanisms push us toward</p>
<p>or bias us toward particular categories of behaviors</p>
<p>by influencing our hormones,</p>
<p>which then feed back and promote more</p>
<p>of that particular behavior.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>peaks in testosterone in males and females</p>
<p>cause individuals to seek sex, not promote parenting.</p>
<p>Whereas reductions in testosterone,</p>
<p>increases in prolactin and decreases in cortisol</p>
<p>move individuals of both sexes toward parenting behavior</p>
<p>and less toward reproductive behavior.</p>
<p>The other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone</p>
<p>in both males and females</p>
<p>and markedly reduces the desire for seeking sex</p>
<p>and sex itself is illness.</p>
<p>And many of you might say,</p>
<p>well, duh, when people don&rsquo;t feel sick,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel like seeking out mates,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel like having sex.</p>
<p>But have you ever wondered why that actually is?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that it can be explained</p>
<p>by the release of what are called inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>So cytokines are related to the immune system,</p>
<p>they travel in the lymph and in the blood</p>
<p>and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>And under conditions of illness,</p>
<p>we make a lot of different cytokines.</p>
<p>Some of them are anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>but some of them are pro-inflammatory.</p>
<p>And the best known example of a pro-inflammatory cytokine</p>
<p>is IL-6.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s known that IL-6 when injected into individuals</p>
<p>will decrease the desire for sex</p>
<p>and eventually will reduce levels of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen independent of feeling lousy.</p>
<p>So the reason why people don&rsquo;t want sex when they&rsquo;re sick</p>
<p>is because levels of IL-6 are increased.</p>
<p>Now, this is important because as we start to think about</p>
<p>the different ways to modulate the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>so-called optimize the hormones,</p>
<p>keeping levels of IL-6 low is going to be important</p>
<p>for them to exert their effects.</p>
<p>Now, IL-6 doesn&rsquo;t just travel to the gonads</p>
<p>and shut down the gonads,</p>
<p>it actually has ways to interact</p>
<p>with some of the receptors that the steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone bind to</p>
<p>and impact those receptors</p>
<p>so that the sex steroid hormones can&rsquo;t have their effect.</p>
<p>In short and put simply,</p>
<p>inflammatory cytokines like IL-6</p>
<p>are bad for sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to modulate IL-6</p>
<p>in the direction that you would want</p>
<p>and how to increase another cytokine called IL-10,</p>
<p>which is anti-inflammatory in ways that can help promote</p>
<p>or at least support the sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>So as we move forward,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to now start to consider</p>
<p>what sorts of behavioral practices,</p>
<p>as well as other things,</p>
<p>can modulate the sex steroid hormones</p>
<p>in the directions that you want them to go.</p>
<p>But before we do that,</p>
<p>and in order to step the stage for that,</p>
<p>you should be asking yourself,</p>
<p>how is it or why is it at a mechanistic level</p>
<p>that behaviors can modulate hormones at all?</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of strange that just the mere act</p>
<p>of being a parent or parenting</p>
<p>can change testosterone levels so dramatically</p>
<p>or estradiol levels so dramatically.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Is it the sweat of the baby?</p>
<p>Is it their saliva?</p>
<p>Is it the sight of the baby?</p>
<p>Is it holding the baby?</p>
<p>Or is it all those things?</p>
<p>It turns out that many of those effects</p>
<p>are because of smell,</p>
<p>or in some cases, even possibly pheromones.</p>
<p>Now I talked about hormones.</p>
<p>Hormones, again, are a chemical,</p>
<p>travels in the body,</p>
<p>impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>A pheromone is a chemical</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released by one member of a species</p>
<p>that goes and impacts members elsewhere,</p>
<p>but of the same species or even of other species.</p>
<p>Now pheromone effects are absolutely well-established</p>
<p>in lots of animal species,</p>
<p>but they are very controversial in humans.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to talk</p>
<p>about some of the well-established ones in animals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned one or two of these before</p>
<p>on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t mentioned several of them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about the evidence</p>
<p>for pheromones in humans that are well-established.</p>
<p>So the main ones in animals that are discussed</p>
<p>are called the Liebhut effect,</p>
<p>the Witten effect, the Bruce effect,</p>
<p>and the Vandenberg effect,</p>
<p>named after the people that discovered them.</p>
<p>The Liebhut effect is when you house females</p>
<p>of a given species together with no males,</p>
<p>they start displaying longer,</p>
<p>what are called estrous cycles.</p>
<p>In many species, they don&rsquo;t have menstrual cycles,</p>
<p>which are 28 days.</p>
<p>They have estrous cycles,</p>
<p>which tend to be four days or some variant thereof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>because what it means is that the presence</p>
<p>of the male itself is changing the ovulation cycle.</p>
<p>Now, many people out there,</p>
<p>imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there,</p>
<p>will say, of course, I notice I ovulate differently</p>
<p>or my cycle changes when I&rsquo;m in the presence</p>
<p>of my partner or I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But the pheromone effect that mirrors</p>
<p>this Liebhut effect in humans</p>
<p>has still not really been identified.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what the exact chemical is,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals.</p>
<p>The other one is the Bruce effect.</p>
<p>And this is a very dramatic effect</p>
<p>whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus</p>
<p>if the dad of those animals,</p>
<p>the father that sired the litter,</p>
<p>because these are animals, they&rsquo;re litters,</p>
<p>is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity</p>
<p>for about 48 hours.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is the way that this happens</p>
<p>is a pheromone that comes from male urine</p>
<p>activates the gonadotropin-releasing hormone system</p>
<p>and causes a reintroduction of the estrous cycle</p>
<p>and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people have taken the Bruce effect</p>
<p>kind of to its extreme and asked whether or not</p>
<p>in humans miscarriages are caused by detecting</p>
<p>the pheromones or odors of novel males,</p>
<p>meaning the non-dad male.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still an open question.</p>
<p>Nobody knows if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>So I want to emphasize that.</p>
<p>The other one is the Vandenberg effect.</p>
<p>And this is one I alluded to</p>
<p>in a previous episode of the podcast,</p>
<p>which is that puberty in females can be accelerated</p>
<p>by placing a novel sexually competent male</p>
<p>in with a young female who has not undergone puberty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a version of this, which I haven&rsquo;t described,</p>
<p>which is delay of puberty,</p>
<p>where you take juvenile female animals</p>
<p>that have not undergone puberty</p>
<p>and you put them with more mature females</p>
<p>of the same species.</p>
<p>And that introduction of more females will cause a delay,</p>
<p>a significant delay in the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>So these are all pheromone effects.</p>
<p>And we know they&rsquo;re pheromone effects</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not conscious.</p>
<p>They also don&rsquo;t require actual contact</p>
<p>with the other members of a given species.</p>
<p>These are all effects that can be mediated</p>
<p>by the urine from a given species</p>
<p>or by the sweat of a given species.</p>
<p>And speaking of sweat,</p>
<p>the one pheromone effect that I&rsquo;m very aware of</p>
<p>from the published literature</p>
<p>is a paper that was published in 1998</p>
<p>by Stern and McClintock,</p>
<p>which was getting at this question</p>
<p>of synchronization of menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>Now, the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles</p>
<p>is pretty controversial.</p>
<p>For a long time, people said,</p>
<p>oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized phenomenon.</p>
<p>People living in dormitories,</p>
<p>their menstrual cycles would synchronize.</p>
<p>People living in environments together,</p>
<p>their menstrual cycles would synchronize.</p>
<p>And then some studies came out</p>
<p>that kind of undercut those data</p>
<p>and said, no, this actually doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And it was kind of controversial.</p>
<p>But there is a very clear effect</p>
<p>that was described by Stern and McClintock.</p>
<p>What they did actually was they took females,</p>
<p>they charted their cycles,</p>
<p>and then they had other females wear pads in their armpits</p>
<p>and they collected sweat from those females.</p>
<p>And then they took the sweat from those pads</p>
<p>in those females&rsquo; armpits,</p>
<p>and they introduced them to women</p>
<p>who had never had contact with the people who had sweated.</p>
<p>They only had contact with their sweat.</p>
<p>In fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose.</p>
<p>But if that sounds gross, they dilute it in alcohol</p>
<p>so much so that they can&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>detect the odor of the sweat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually very important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the smell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the pheromone chemical itself.</p>
<p>And it turns out the pheromone chemical itself</p>
<p>can modulate the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>although it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>synchronize it with the sweater.</p>
<p>What it does is it changes the duration</p>
<p>and the pattern of ovulation</p>
<p>relative to so-called follicular phase.</p>
<p>Long and short of this is that</p>
<p>the sweat and pheromones of females</p>
<p>can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns</p>
<p>of other adult females.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of whether or not they synchronize.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re kind of rolling your eyes now and saying,</p>
<p>well, of course they do, and this is really detailed,</p>
<p>this is how the science is done.</p>
<p>And the reason why people are so skeptical</p>
<p>about the presence of pheromone effects in humans</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no well-identified pheromone organ.</p>
<p>You know, we have an area of our nose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for smelling, that&rsquo;s well-established.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been observed in MRIs many, many times,</p>
<p>in cadavers many, many times,</p>
<p>in pretty much all individuals.</p>
<p>But the vomeronasal organ,</p>
<p>which is the pheromone-detecting organ,</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really been found in humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called Jacobson&rsquo;s organ,</p>
<p>which is thought to be the organ in the nose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually on the top of the roof of the mouth.</p>
<p>And in the kind of back of the nose,</p>
<p>this is for a few wine tasters,</p>
<p>I never can pronounce this,</p>
<p>what are they called, sommelier, sommelier, whatevers,</p>
<p>the people that are excellent at drinking</p>
<p>and detecting the essences of wine</p>
<p>that you have to go through all these tests</p>
<p>in order to get certified as one of them.</p>
<p>Somebody tell me.</p>
<p>They are using probably a similar mechanism</p>
<p>of mixing taste and smell.</p>
<p>And Jacobson&rsquo;s organ, if it exists,</p>
<p>the vomeronasal equivalent in humans</p>
<p>is thought to be a combination of smell and taste.</p>
<p>Now, it gets even weirder and cooler</p>
<p>when you think about a given study</p>
<p>that was done in humans</p>
<p>where if you take hundreds of t-shirts from boyfriends,</p>
<p>keep them separate, you take those t-shirts,</p>
<p>you wash them many times separately,</p>
<p>and then you offer them to the girlfriends,</p>
<p>the longtime partners of those guys,</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ll find is that the girlfriend</p>
<p>can pick out her boyfriend&rsquo;s t-shirt</p>
<p>among hundreds of other t-shirts,</p>
<p>not because it smells different,</p>
<p>but because something about it seems different.</p>
<p>It might smell different to her</p>
<p>in some way that&rsquo;s kind of imperceptible even to her.</p>
<p>And the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt,</p>
<p>her partner&rsquo;s t-shirt,</p>
<p>is way above statistical significant thresholds,</p>
<p>so much so that you almost have to say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about these effects</p>
<p>that are real pheromone effects.</p>
<p>Although people still argue</p>
<p>that there are no pheromone effects in humans,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all through olfaction.</p>
<p>I think these are interesting and important to understand</p>
<p>because it means that a lot of things</p>
<p>coming through our nose,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s pheromones or smells,</p>
<p>are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories</p>
<p>and kind of recognition of mates and other people,</p>
<p>including our children, not just our mates.</p>
<p>And of course, perfume manufacturers</p>
<p>have really picked up on the idea of pheromones</p>
<p>and have entire laboratories set up</p>
<p>to build chemical compounds into perfumes</p>
<p>that are designed to attract other mates.</p>
<p>This is a well-established and well-documented phenomenon.</p>
<p>And the last point I&rsquo;ll make about pheromones</p>
<p>is that this combination of taste and smell</p>
<p>is such a real thing in the animal world</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something called the Fleming response.</p>
<p>During the mating season for different animals,</p>
<p>you can actually even see this in horses,</p>
<p>but for animals that are seasonal maters,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do something called the Fleming response</p>
<p>where they actually open their lips and their mouth</p>
<p>and they expose their gums</p>
<p>so that they can capture pheromones</p>
<p>that are floating in the wind and the environment.</p>
<p>They actually are looking for mates using their mouth</p>
<p>and kind of sniffing around.</p>
<p>If you own a dog and you watch the way</p>
<p>that the dog will sniff around,</p>
<p>selecting where they want to urinate, males and females,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often, they&rsquo;re bringing molecules into their nose.</p>
<p>I know it sounds kind of gross, sniffing urine,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of pheromones in urine of animals.</p>
<p>A lot of pheromones are traveling in the wind.</p>
<p>Again, whether or not this is happening in humans,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but then you think about the perfume thing,</p>
<p>and here people are putting these scents on themselves</p>
<p>that contain putative pheromones, human pheromones,</p>
<p>and walking around hoping that their scents</p>
<p>are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior</p>
<p>from other individuals of the same human species.</p>
<p>So we are among the animals in this behavior,</p>
<p>independent of whether or not</p>
<p>you believe pheromone effects exist.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get back to behaviors</p>
<p>that can help optimize hormone levels.</p>
<p>One of the main behaviors that&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>to be associated with poor levels of estrogen</p>
<p>relative to age-match controls for people with ovaries,</p>
<p>or lower levels of testosterone</p>
<p>compared to age-match controls for people with testes,</p>
<p>is apnea.</p>
<p>Apnea has everything to do with under-breathing</p>
<p>and the buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body.</p>
<p>There are other effects of apnea as well.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s a consistent literature</p>
<p>in this whole story about aging and reductions in hormones</p>
<p>and general health and reductions in hormones, it&rsquo;s apnea.</p>
<p>I went deep into the literature on advanced menopause,</p>
<p>or when menopausal symptoms are exacerbated.</p>
<p>And I went into the literature on andropause,</p>
<p>or early onset andropause,</p>
<p>so levels of testosterone that are far lower</p>
<p>than they should be for a given age.</p>
<p>And in every case, you could find multiple papers</p>
<p>that showed that apnea, or poor efficiency of breathing</p>
<p>and buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body,</p>
<p>was a problem.</p>
<p>Mostly sleep apnea, although apnea in general</p>
<p>was shown to be an issue negatively impacting hormones.</p>
<p>Now, the directionality of this effect isn&rsquo;t entirely clear.</p>
<p>It could be that reductions in estrogen cause apnea.</p>
<p>And actually, there&rsquo;s some reason to believe</p>
<p>that might be the case.</p>
<p>I found at least one paper</p>
<p>showing that there are estrogen receptors</p>
<p>on some of the neurons that actually innervate the lungs</p>
<p>and allow for the perception</p>
<p>of how full or empty the lungs are.</p>
<p>In other words, reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing</p>
<p>by changing our sensitivity to our own lungs.</p>
<p>Now, that was true for males and females.</p>
<p>Remember, estrogen in both males and females.</p>
<p>But as well, I found papers</p>
<p>in which testosterone reductions were associated with apnea</p>
<p>and testosterone receptors are also found</p>
<p>on a lot of cells in the so-called viscera,</p>
<p>including the lungs.</p>
<p>So again, the directionality of the effect isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that there are very clear ways</p>
<p>in which patterns of breathing,</p>
<p>especially patterns of breathing in sleep,</p>
<p>can modulate hormones</p>
<p>in ways that are immediately actionable</p>
<p>and can serve to optimize both estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you have ovaries or testes.</p>
<p>So what is apnea?</p>
<p>Apnea is under-breathing</p>
<p>or mainly cessation of breathing during sleep.</p>
<p>So people are holding their breath</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll suddenly wake up.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve talked about the physiological sigh</p>
<p>on previous episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>of this pattern of double inhales followed by exhales</p>
<p>that one can do consciously to reduce stress and anxiety</p>
<p>and offload carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>That pattern of breathing</p>
<p>is actually what kicks in spontaneously</p>
<p>anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep.</p>
<p>Although in many people who have apnea,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t engage the physiological sigh.</p>
<p>People who are dramatically overweight</p>
<p>also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of buildup</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide in the body.</p>
<p>And that can lead to excessive sleepiness during the day,</p>
<p>inability to access the deeper phases of sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s well-established</p>
<p>that going into deep sleep</p>
<p>and getting the proper patterns</p>
<p>of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep</p>
<p>are important for hormone optimization.</p>
<p>I talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep</p>
<p>in the first month of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So please check out those episodes</p>
<p>if you have sleep issues or you want to work on your sleep.</p>
<p>Also check out Matt Walker&rsquo;s terrific book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;While We Sleep,&rsquo;</p>
<p>and that will help you find various protocols</p>
<p>to help you optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>But the issue of breathing itself</p>
<p>can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours</p>
<p>in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,</p>
<p>reduce incidence of sleep apnea,</p>
<p>and apparently from some emerging literature,</p>
<p>can also help to optimize various hormones</p>
<p>even just by breathing in particular ways while awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a lot of literature showing</p>
<p>that breathing through the nose, not through the mouth,</p>
<p>is powerful for improving lots of things.</p>
<p>First of all, it improves cosmetic features</p>
<p>of the jaw and face.</p>
<p>This was first well-established by my colleagues</p>
<p>at Stanford in a book called,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jaws, The Story of a Hidden Epidemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,</p>
<p>who are both faculty at Stanford,</p>
<p>as a forward by Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>the great Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>And it also has a heavy endorsement up front</p>
<p>by Jared Diamond, the author of,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guns, Germs, and Steel,&rsquo; the Pulitzer winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a lot of heavy hitters on this book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jaws.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a book that a lot of people know about,</p>
<p>unfortunately, but it really describes</p>
<p>the benefits of nasal breathing</p>
<p>and the terrible things that happen</p>
<p>when people, in particular children, but adults also,</p>
<p>are heavy mouth breathers.</p>
<p>So mouth breathers have changes in the cosmetics</p>
<p>of their face and jaw that are really bad</p>
<p>in terms of attractiveness.</p>
<p>And this was done in twin studies.</p>
<p>You can look in the book and see some of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really dramatic how being a mouth breather</p>
<p>tends to make the chin drop back behind the upper mandible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lengthening in the face, a drooping of the eyes.</p>
<p>It can be quite dramatic or modest</p>
<p>depending on how much mouth breathing.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes we have to breathe with our mouths,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a lot of data and studies described</p>
<p>in this book, &ldquo;&lsquo;Jaws,&rsquo; that describe how nose breathing</p>
<p>in wakefulness and in sleep promotes all sorts</p>
<p>of positive things related to not just cosmetics,</p>
<p>but also the improvement of gas exchange</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body.</p>
<p>And as well, it can modify levels</p>
<p>of different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators</p>
<p>in ways that positively can impact hormones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So believe it or not, being a nasal breather</p>
<p>and avoiding being a mouth breather</p>
<p>can actually positively impact hormones.</p>
<p>And in particular, the hormones, testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Although the way that it does that</p>
<p>is by making you a better sleeper,</p>
<p>which allows you to produce more testosterone</p>
<p>and the appropriate amounts of testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>But it does that in part through indirect mechanisms</p>
<p>because deep sleep supports the gonads,</p>
<p>the ovaries and the testicles,</p>
<p>and their turnover of cells and the production of cells.</p>
<p>Remember in the ovary, particular cells</p>
<p>and the egg follicles themselves make estrogen.</p>
<p>And in the testicle that the Sertoli cells</p>
<p>and the Leydig cells are important for the formation</p>
<p>of sperm and for testosterone respectively.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>This means we have to be breathing properly.</p>
<p>It almost sounds kind of, you know, like kind of new agey,</p>
<p>like, oh, you have to breathe properly,</p>
<p>get your hormones right.</p>
<p>But no, you have to breathe properly</p>
<p>to get your breathing and sleep right</p>
<p>so that your sleep can actually be deep enough</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not entering apnea states.</p>
<p>And then that will support gonad function.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t be putting this out</p>
<p>as one of the main behavioral tools up front</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that the effects of apnea</p>
<p>on these hormones are dramatic and terrible.</p>
<p>And the positive effects of getting breathing right</p>
<p>on these hormones, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are dramatic and wonderful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about a few of those studies briefly</p>
<p>so I can underscore the value of proper breathing</p>
<p>in order to optimize hormones.</p>
<p>So I was able to find at least four quality studies</p>
<p>showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep or eliminated,</p>
<p>there are significant increases in testosterone in males</p>
<p>and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios in females.</p>
<p>And the way that it works is very interesting.</p>
<p>Apparently it works by reductions in cortisol.</p>
<p>Now, cortisol is a stress hormone</p>
<p>that is released early in the day as we wake up</p>
<p>and serves healthy roles in protecting us</p>
<p>against infection, reducing inflammation, et cetera.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want cortisol to be too high</p>
<p>and you certainly don&rsquo;t want it elevated too long</p>
<p>throughout the day and night.</p>
<p>And so we all know,</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;ve been told a lot in the last decade or so,</p>
<p>that getting proper sleep is important</p>
<p>for all these aspects of health.</p>
<p>Getting proper sleep can really offset</p>
<p>all the reductions in testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and reductions in fertility that occur</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t get enough sleep.</p>
<p>But seldom is it discussed how sleep actually adjusts</p>
<p>things like testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And it does it by modifying cortisol.</p>
<p>So the molecule cholesterol can be converted</p>
<p>into testosterone or estrogen,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a competition</p>
<p>whereby the cholesterol will turn into cortisol</p>
<p>and not testosterone,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;ll turn into cortisol and not estrogen</p>
<p>if stress levels are too high.</p>
<p>So the simple version of this</p>
<p>is getting your breathing right during the waking hours,</p>
<p>meaning primarily, unless you&rsquo;re working out really hard</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s some other reason</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re maybe eating or speaking</p>
<p>that you need to be breathing through your mouth,</p>
<p>you should be a nose breather.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really good evidence for that now.</p>
<p>And in sleep, you also want to be a nose breather</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to increase the amount of oxygen</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bringing into your system</p>
<p>and the amount of carbon dioxide that you&rsquo;re offloading.</p>
<p>There are other positive effects of it as well,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically reducing apnea.</p>
<p>Breath holding in sleep</p>
<p>leads to buildup of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and leads to increases in cortisol,</p>
<p>which then decrease testosterone</p>
<p>and decrease estrogen in negative ways across all sexes.</p>
<p>Okay, so the simple version of this</p>
<p>is get your breathing right.</p>
<p>So how do you do that?</p>
<p>How do you get your breathing right?</p>
<p>Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to need the CPAP machine.</p>
<p>This is a machine that you actually put on your face</p>
<p>and it helps you breathe properly in sleep.</p>
<p>Many people, however,</p>
<p>are starting to do this thing of taping their mouth shut.</p>
<p>Now, this sounds a little bit extreme</p>
<p>and you certainly don&rsquo;t want to do this</p>
<p>in any way that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>James Nestor talked about this in his book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art,&rdquo;</p>
<p>that simply taping shut the mouth with some tape</p>
<p>that will allow you to open your mouth</p>
<p>if you really need to during sleep</p>
<p>can allow people to shift over</p>
<p>from being mouth breathers and snorers to nose breathers.</p>
<p>In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal breathing</p>
<p>is to dilate the nasal passages</p>
<p>because a lot of people have a hard time</p>
<p>breathing through their nose.</p>
<p>And one way to do this</p>
<p>is to just breathe through your nose more.</p>
<p>And one way to do that is that when you exercise,</p>
<p>in particular, cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>most of the time, provided you&rsquo;re not in maximum effort,</p>
<p>you should be nasal breathing.</p>
<p>Now, for a lot of people,</p>
<p>nasal breathing during exercise is hard at first,</p>
<p>but as you do it,</p>
<p>because the sinuses have a capacity to dilate over time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get better at it.</p>
<p>The sinuses, if you haven&rsquo;t ever held a skull,</p>
<p>because of my job as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve held a lot of skulls,</p>
<p>taken a lot of brains out of a lot of skulls,</p>
<p>teach neuroanatomy and have done that for,</p>
<p>goodness, God knows how many species I&rsquo;ve done that for,</p>
<p>including human.</p>
<p>But what the sinuses are is they&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve got are you&rsquo;ve got these little portals</p>
<p>in the bone that run up here and down here</p>
<p>behind the nose and into the jaw.</p>
<p>If you ever had a cold and your sinuses are stuffed up,</p>
<p>you feel like you have congestion here and here</p>
<p>and around your ears and in your cheeks and in your face.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the sinuses are actually portals</p>
<p>where the bones are fused together,</p>
<p>kind of interdigitated like this.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re lined, of course, with mucus membranes.</p>
<p>And as you start to nasal breathe more,</p>
<p>the nasal passages will start to dilate more.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re not going to get giant nostrils.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s going to end up happening</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to have an easier time breathing</p>
<p>through your nose just from waking.</p>
<p>So my advice would be breathe through your nose</p>
<p>while exercising, unless you&rsquo;re in maximum effort.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, what you&rsquo;ll find is you actually</p>
<p>can create more output than you would</p>
<p>if you were breathing through your mouth.</p>
<p>And of course, there are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re swimming, follow that breath protocol.</p>
<p>For fighters and martial artists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s reason to do the kind of exhale breathing</p>
<p>through the mouth, the shh kind of thing.</p>
<p>There are reasons to do that sort of thing</p>
<p>for particular sports, but for most people</p>
<p>who are kind of recreational athletes or exercisers,</p>
<p>learn to be a nasal breather.</p>
<p>Has positive cosmetic effects.</p>
<p>It reduces apnea.</p>
<p>It offloads more carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>It increases lung capacity.</p>
<p>It dilates the sinuses.</p>
<p>And it prevents apnea in sleep.</p>
<p>So unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,</p>
<p>becoming a nasal breather can have all sorts</p>
<p>of positive effects by reducing cortisol,</p>
<p>reducing apnea, and indirectly,</p>
<p>raising testosterone and estrogen in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>So this might seem kind of foundational and indirect,</p>
<p>but when you go into the scientific literature,</p>
<p>it comes through as one of the most powerful things</p>
<p>that you can do that is zero cost.</p>
<p>It takes a little effort, but it&rsquo;s zero cost.</p>
<p>And it has all these positive effects across the board,</p>
<p>both cosmetic and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first piece of behavioral advice.</p>
<p>The second piece of behavioral advice relates</p>
<p>to the viewing of light.</p>
<p>And many of you have heard me talk about this before,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to belabor the point</p>
<p>that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s from artificial light</p>
<p>or ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>But we have to return to this if you want to understand</p>
<p>how light can impact hormones,</p>
<p>because hormones, light, and dopamine</p>
<p>have a very close-knit relationship,</p>
<p>so much so that your light-viewing behavior</p>
<p>can actually have a direct effect</p>
<p>on hormone levels and fertility.</p>
<p>It can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido.</p>
<p>It can have a direct effect on hormone levels</p>
<p>and your ability to heal quickly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about shining light</p>
<p>on particular injuries.</p>
<p>That may or may not have positive effects.</p>
<p>You know, we can argue about that on a subsequent episode.</p>
<p>It may, but what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>is viewing light with your eyes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that now,</p>
<p>because the scientific literature on this are robust</p>
<p>and they extend back several decades,</p>
<p>and yet I think most people don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>how powerful this relationship is</p>
<p>between light, dopamine, hormones,</p>
<p>and all the great things that the sex steroid hormones do</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re available in your body in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>In order to understand the powerful effects</p>
<p>that light can have on the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>we need to understand seasonal breeding animals.</p>
<p>Now, humans are not seasonal breeders,</p>
<p>but if you understand the biology</p>
<p>of how light impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll set yourself up for a deep understanding</p>
<p>of what you should do with your light-viewing behavior.</p>
<p>So several species of animals,</p>
<p>many species of animals, in fact,</p>
<p>like rabbits and fox and various mustelids</p>
<p>like ferrets and ermines,</p>
<p>change their pellage color across the seasons.</p>
<p>This might be kind of a duh,</p>
<p>but fox in winter are often white or light gray,</p>
<p>and those same animals will be brown or darker colored</p>
<p>in the summertime and spring months.</p>
<p>Now, those same animals breed in the spring</p>
<p>and they shut down breeding.</p>
<p>They actually shut down ovulation.</p>
<p>They often shut down testosterone production</p>
<p>in the winter months.</p>
<p>So right now, I&rsquo;m just correlating color of fur</p>
<p>with tendency to breed.</p>
<p>Tendency to breed, as we know,</p>
<p>is going to be related to the levels of sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen, and testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, why would these two things be linked?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them.</p>
<p>So dopamine has a precursor.</p>
<p>That precursor is tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is an amino acid, comes from food.</p>
<p>And when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for more</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>all the hormones that come</p>
<p>from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis</p>
<p>and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release</p>
<p>from the ovary and testes.</p>
<p>Dopamine basically increases all of that.</p>
<p>The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,</p>
<p>but the precursor to a lot</p>
<p>of the melanin-producing elements of cells</p>
<p>that give pigmentation, including for the hair,</p>
<p>is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme.</p>
<p>So yes, the same amino acid-based pathway</p>
<p>and many of the same enzymes</p>
<p>that are devoted to dopamine</p>
<p>and dopamine-increasing the sex steroid hormones</p>
<p>are devoted to giving pigmentation to the hair and skin.</p>
<p>And this is why in the summer months,</p>
<p>when days are longer, animals are breeding more.</p>
<p>And this is also why in the winter months,</p>
<p>when days are shorter, animals are breeding less.</p>
<p>This is also why in humans, many people, not all,</p>
<p>feel an elevation in mood in the spring and summer months</p>
<p>because of the amount of sunlight they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>is increased relative to the winter months.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be saying,</p>
<p>I love the fall, I love the winter.</p>
<p>Sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems</p>
<p>has a strong genetic component.</p>
<p>So you go to some areas of the world,</p>
<p>I have relatives who are Scandinavian,</p>
<p>and in some areas of Scandinavia,</p>
<p>people know that there&rsquo;s a kind of seasonal affective</p>
<p>disorder, there&rsquo;s kind of a seasonal depression,</p>
<p>and people get sadder and more quiet.</p>
<p>And in the winter, there&rsquo;s actually less going out,</p>
<p>and therefore there&rsquo;s less sexual behavior,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less partying and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But other people will say, no, during the winter months,</p>
<p>I feel great and I love the holidays around winter, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of variation.</p>
<p>But in general, the pathway is the following.</p>
<p>Increased viewing of sunlight,</p>
<p>and it has to be to the eyes, it&rsquo;s not to the skin,</p>
<p>increased viewing of sunlight,</p>
<p>increases dopamine levels in the brain,</p>
<p>increased dopamine levels in animals and humans,</p>
<p>increases the amount of these melanocytes</p>
<p>and the activity of these melanin producing cells,</p>
<p>which give pigmentation to the skin and hair,</p>
<p>and indirectly increase the amount of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen and thereby reproductive behavior,</p>
<p>feelings of wellbeing, social interactions,</p>
<p>reductions, anxiety, et cetera.</p>
<p>All of which should make sense</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;ve talked about already</p>
<p>in terms of the biology and the impact</p>
<p>of these steroid hormones</p>
<p>on various aspects of the mind and body.</p>
<p>So how does this translate to a protocol?</p>
<p>This translates to the protocol of,</p>
<p>if you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>you need to get your light viewing behavior correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about optimizing your sleep,</p>
<p>which is also important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes</p>
<p>so you have sufficient levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So the simple protocols for that I&rsquo;ve reviewed before,</p>
<p>but it means getting anywhere from two to 10 minutes</p>
<p>of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses</p>
<p>unless you have to do that for safety reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get sunlight for whatever reason,</p>
<p>you want to use bright artificial light.</p>
<p>But that is absolutely critical</p>
<p>for timing the cortisol release properly,</p>
<p>limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day,</p>
<p>getting increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that are going to promote the production</p>
<p>of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels.</p>
<p>The other aspect of light viewing behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely important</p>
<p>is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re viewing bright light in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>you are suppressing dopamine release.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re suppressing dopamine release,</p>
<p>you are suppressing testosterone levels.</p>
<p>So much so that I would wager that a major effect</p>
<p>of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because usually when people</p>
<p>are not getting enough sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting too much light in their eyes</p>
<p>in the middle of the night as well.</p>
<p>A study on this has not been completed yet,</p>
<p>but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron,</p>
<p>both cell press journals, excellent journals,</p>
<p>showing that viewing bright light with the eyes</p>
<p>in the middle of the circadian night</p>
<p>has a detrimental effect on dopamine</p>
<p>and therefore has a detrimental effect</p>
<p>on things like testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t even begin to talk about supplements</p>
<p>and other ways to optimize testosterone,</p>
<p>diet and its effects on testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera,</p>
<p>until you get your breathing right,</p>
<p>until you get things like</p>
<p>your light viewing behavior right.</p>
<p>So bright light early in the day</p>
<p>and throughout the day is great.</p>
<p>View as much bright light, ideally sunlight, as you can,</p>
<p>as much as you safely can.</p>
<p>You obviously don&rsquo;t want to burn your retinas</p>
<p>or damage your retinas,</p>
<p>so never look at any light that&rsquo;s so bright</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s painful to look at.</p>
<p>But getting a lot of light in your eyes</p>
<p>is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake rhythms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And avoiding bright light in the middle of the night</p>
<p>is not just about not disrupting your sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And now that you understand a bit</p>
<p>of how the sex steroid hormones work</p>
<p>and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety</p>
<p>and all these other effects,</p>
<p>this should be straightforward to do</p>
<p>or hopefully it&rsquo;s inspired you</p>
<p>to get your light viewing behavior</p>
<p>and your breathing behavior correct.</p>
<p>In fact, in thinking about tools,</p>
<p>for many people that are suffering</p>
<p>from low levels of estrogen if they want higher levels</p>
<p>or low levels of testosterone if they want higher levels,</p>
<p>just getting the breathing and light viewing behavior,</p>
<p>which will indirectly support sleep behavior,</p>
<p>can be a huge and positive effect</p>
<p>on levels of sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>I can already anticipate that in hearing this,</p>
<p>you might wonder whether or not viewing light</p>
<p>is going to, for instance, increase your testosterone a lot</p>
<p>when in fact you want your estrogen increased</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to increase your estrogen a lot</p>
<p>when you want your testosterone increased.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;m describing here</p>
<p>is for people regardless of chromosomal</p>
<p>or gonadal background.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to basically offer all this information</p>
<p>in one swoop.</p>
<p>But basically, if you&rsquo;re somebody who naturally has ovaries</p>
<p>and has higher levels of estrogen than testosterone,</p>
<p>then viewing bright light early in the day</p>
<p>because of dopamine&rsquo;s effects</p>
<p>is going to promote more estrogen</p>
<p>and subtle increases in testosterone.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re somebody who starts off</p>
<p>with more testosterone and lower estrogen,</p>
<p>so somebody presumably who has testes</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re supplementing with testosterone</p>
<p>through other sources for whatever reason,</p>
<p>bright light viewing is going to increase testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen in parallel,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still going to maintain</p>
<p>the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>In short, you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to increase the wrong hormone.</p>
<p>This is all about optimizing the ratios of hormones</p>
<p>that you already have.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about breathing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about light.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a third element</p>
<p>that there seems to be some excitement about lately</p>
<p>for other reasons,</p>
<p>but that can actually have some pretty profound influences</p>
<p>on hormone levels, and that&rsquo;s heat and cold.</p>
<p>So as always, rather than just offer a tool,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you the underlying science</p>
<p>as it relates to naturally occurring phenomenon,</p>
<p>because in understanding that</p>
<p>and understanding the mechanism,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a far better position</p>
<p>to understand the tools and mechanisms</p>
<p>and how you might want to adjust them for your own life.</p>
<p>So now you understand the relationship</p>
<p>between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels,</p>
<p>and everyone should realize</p>
<p>that temperature and day length are linked,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure as I say that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably thinking, oh, of course.</p>
<p>In summer, when there&rsquo;s more sunlight,</p>
<p>days are longer, nights are shorter,</p>
<p>in general, it tends to be warmer out,</p>
<p>and in winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter,</p>
<p>it tends to be colder out.</p>
<p>And in the winter months,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower in many animals</p>
<p>and in humans, and in the summer months,</p>
<p>because of the role of dopamine</p>
<p>in promoting the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>when days are longer and it&rsquo;s warmer,</p>
<p>humans tend to make more estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>relative to the other months of the year.</p>
<p>Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated</p>
<p>as opposed to in seasonally breathing animals</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re really dramatic, okay?</p>
<p>But the point is that temperature and day length</p>
<p>and sunlight, those are all intimately related</p>
<p>because of the systems that we evolved in, right?</p>
<p>So before we had artificial light and artificial heating</p>
<p>and artificial cooling,</p>
<p>our biology evolved under systems where temperature,</p>
<p>day length, and the hormones</p>
<p>were correlated with one another.</p>
<p>So nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in using cold as a way to stimulate testosterone.</p>
<p>This is mainly because in the sports community,</p>
<p>in particular, in the bodybuilding community,</p>
<p>they are always seeking ways to maximize testosterone,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone, keep estrogen to its minimum required</p>
<p>to still have libido and still have skin elasticity,</p>
<p>but also walk around with Saran wrap skin.</p>
<p>Then all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there</p>
<p>has led to a recent movement where,</p>
<p>believe it or not, I heard this</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t believe I went and checked,</p>
<p>although I didn&rsquo;t buy them,</p>
<p>that on Amazon, you can actually find people have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re literally underwear that have ice packs,</p>
<p>or I think they&rsquo;re ice pack underwear,</p>
<p>so that people are making themselves cold</p>
<p>at the level of the gonads</p>
<p>in order to try and increase testosterone and libido.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty crazy, but believe it or not,</p>
<p>that and things like ice baths and cold showers</p>
<p>can have positive effects on the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>both testosterone, mainly in males,</p>
<p>and estrogen, mainly in females.</p>
<p>And you might say, wait,</p>
<p>I thought cold makes the reproductive axis</p>
<p>kind of shut down a bit</p>
<p>or reduces testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>but it turns out it&rsquo;s not actually the cold</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s having these effects in people.</p>
<p>Things like the ice bath, cold showers, cold water swims,</p>
<p>these ice underwear, whatever they are,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t believe that these actually exist, but they do exist.</p>
<p>What happens is there&rsquo;s a rebound</p>
<p>in vasodilation after cooling.</p>
<p>So cooling causes vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>and then after the cooling, there&rsquo;s a rebound vasodilation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s more infusion of blood into the gonads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an effect that&rsquo;s neural.</p>
<p>So let me explain how this works,</p>
<p>because there are only a few studies on this,</p>
<p>none of which looking at the frozen underwear,</p>
<p>but that have looked at cold exposure</p>
<p>and levels of androgens and estrogens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>So you have to remember that the gonad,</p>
<p>the ovaries and the testes are heavily vascularized.</p>
<p>Remember, even at the level of the brain,</p>
<p>GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>comes from neurons that, believe it or not,</p>
<p>start off in your nose early in development,</p>
<p>migrate into the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making that up.</p>
<p>They started off in your nose</p>
<p>and migrated into the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Those neurons extend processes,</p>
<p>we call them axons, into the pituitary</p>
<p>and release GnRH into the pituitary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of vascularization within the pituitary.</p>
<p>So now those hormones, or GnRH,</p>
<p>can stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone, which then are released</p>
<p>and travel into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Then those hormones reach the ovary or testes,</p>
<p>and they have to get into the ovary and testes.</p>
<p>And the way they do that is through the vascular system.</p>
<p>And people forget, but the vascular system</p>
<p>and how constricted or dilated vessels are</p>
<p>is controlled by neurons, right?</p>
<p>This is, we discussed this during the discussion</p>
<p>about stress in the stress episode.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s well-known to neuroscientists</p>
<p>that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool them.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of examples of this</p>
<p>in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>but most people aren&rsquo;t aware of it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not digging around</p>
<p>in the methods section of these papers.</p>
<p>But when we want to shut down neurons,</p>
<p>we can do things like inject drugs</p>
<p>that will do that, like lidocaine,</p>
<p>the stuff that makes you numb at the dentist,</p>
<p>or you can use different inhibitors.</p>
<p>But one of the best ways to do it experimentally</p>
<p>is to just cool neurons.</p>
<p>When you make neurons cold,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a temperature dependence</p>
<p>of when neurons can be active and when they can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the neurons shut down.</p>
<p>So the most plausible explanation for why cold exposure,</p>
<p>either through one to 10-minute ice bath or cold shower,</p>
<p>or the ice underpants thing,</p>
<p>would increase testosterone or increase estrogen</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re cooling the neurons</p>
<p>that control vasoconstriction and vasodilation</p>
<p>and shutting down the entry of blood,</p>
<p>or at least reducing it, and hormones into the gonad.</p>
<p>And then when the gonad</p>
<p>and the surrounding area heats up again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a rebound hypervasodilation</p>
<p>that delivers excessive levels of,</p>
<p>not excessive, but increased levels of GnRH</p>
<p>and other hormones and carriers</p>
<p>and carrier proteins and so forth</p>
<p>that would then stimulate the gonad</p>
<p>to release more testosterone,</p>
<p>or would stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most plausible explanation I can come up with.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies</p>
<p>looking at direct effects of temperature on the gonad.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a difficult study</p>
<p>to carry out in any case,</p>
<p>because unless it were done in vitro in a dish,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to eliminate all the other things</p>
<p>like vasoconstriction, vasodilation.</p>
<p>Put simply, we don&rsquo;t know whether or not cold and heat</p>
<p>directly affect the production of testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>We only know that cold and heat can modulate those</p>
<p>probably through indirect mechanisms</p>
<p>like controlling the amount of blood flow</p>
<p>by way of shutting down or activating the neurons.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of lore</p>
<p>around heating up the gonads too much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a whole set of pseudoscience webpages</p>
<p>out there saying, well, if you want a girl,</p>
<p>you should conceive the child at this room temperature.</p>
<p>And if you want a boy,</p>
<p>you should conceive the child at this room temperature.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s really any firm scientific evidence</p>
<p>for that, for either one.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some interesting literature</p>
<p>about temperature dependence of production of hormones.</p>
<p>And I think that it probably relates to these mechanisms</p>
<p>of vasodilation and neural control over vasodilation.</p>
<p>And of course, excessively high heat is not good</p>
<p>for the testes, for sperm production, or for sperm health.</p>
<p>Sperm have all sorts of proteins in the cap,</p>
<p>things like pentraxins and other things</p>
<p>that cause them to swim faster</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re expressed properly and in the right locations.</p>
<p>And heat actually alters the location</p>
<p>and the function a lot of those proteins.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very heat sensitive.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why excessive heat</p>
<p>is truly not good for fertility,</p>
<p>which may be independent of heat&rsquo;s roles</p>
<p>in promoting estrogen or testosterone.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we&rsquo;ve talked about breathing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about light and temperature,</p>
<p>we talked about parenthood, we talked about competition,</p>
<p>and we talked about some pheromone effects.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about particular forms of exercise</p>
<p>and how they modulate the steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to talk about various supplements,</p>
<p>both in reference to testosterone</p>
<p>and in reference to estrogen.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about how exercise in its various forms,</p>
<p>weight training, endurance work, weight training to failure,</p>
<p>or less intense weight training,</p>
<p>can impact testosterone levels.</p>
<p>But I want to remind you that we&rsquo;re talking about testosterone</p>
<p>both in males and females.</p>
<p>And based on what you know from earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>testosterone can have numerous positive effects</p>
<p>in both males and females,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re in optimal range.</p>
<p>So if you look on the web, people will say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, testosterone is increased by weight training.</p>
<p>You want to do big, heavy compound movement,</p>
<p>squats and deadlifts and chins and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But what about the scientific studies?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the actual basis for this?</p>
<p>Because if you just take a step back and look at this</p>
<p>from the perspective of a scientist, you&rsquo;d say, okay,</p>
<p>what is a squat?</p>
<p>A squat is loading up a bunch of weights on a bar</p>
<p>and then sitting down essentially</p>
<p>and standing up over and over again.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a deadlift?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lifting heavy weights from the ground.</p>
<p>Why would that increase testosterone?</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s often not discussed in the weight training</p>
<p>or even the exercise science community.</p>
<p>What would actually stimulate the release of testosterone</p>
<p>from the adrenals and or testes?</p>
<p>And which one is it, adrenals or testes or both?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s often not discussed, but as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>this is the kinds of things we think about</p>
<p>because we think always that genes don&rsquo;t create behavior.</p>
<p>Immune systems don&rsquo;t know when to be activated.</p>
<p>Lungs don&rsquo;t know when to inhale or exhale.</p>
<p>Hearts don&rsquo;t know when to beat</p>
<p>except for the information that it gets from neurons.</p>
<p>The nervous system controls all of that.</p>
<p>And so really the answer has to be in the neural system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to these particular types</p>
<p>of weight-bearing exercises.</p>
<p>So when you go into this literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to find real mechanism.</p>
<p>You see a lot of effects.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear things like androgen receptor content,</p>
<p>meaning testosterone and its derivatives,</p>
<p>receptor content following heavy resistance exercise.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll find some examples that for instance,</p>
<p>you know, they do muscle biopsies.</p>
<p>They can actually see receptor increases</p>
<p>looking at either high volume or low volume,</p>
<p>really intense exercise.</p>
<p>And you can find a lot of that,</p>
<p>but not a lot of mechanism</p>
<p>about how the nervous system would do this.</p>
<p>And the reason you&rsquo;d want to know how it can do it</p>
<p>is that you could potentially build better protocols</p>
<p>or figure out exactly what about these movements</p>
<p>is triggering increases in androgen receptors</p>
<p>and testosterone.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting is when you start digging</p>
<p>into the more mechanistic studies,</p>
<p>what you find is that heavy weight training,</p>
<p>so this is weight training where the sets are done</p>
<p>with anywhere from, you know, kind of one to eight rep range.</p>
<p>So this translates differently</p>
<p>depending on ratio of muscle fiber type and so forth,</p>
<p>but where basically people are working at anywhere</p>
<p>from like 70% to 95% of their maximum,</p>
<p>or sometimes even going right down</p>
<p>to their one repetition maximum,</p>
<p>really kind of, you know, max effort.</p>
<p>What you find is that using the nervous system</p>
<p>in a way in which they&rsquo;re moving heavy loads.</p>
<p>So that I would translate to recruitment</p>
<p>of high threshold motor units for you muscle physiologists.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a rule in muscle physiology</p>
<p>about the neuron recruitment for moving muscles</p>
<p>where you basically use the minimum number of motor units</p>
<p>of neurons to activate muscle as you possibly can.</p>
<p>As loads increase, you have to recruit more and more neurons.</p>
<p>You always hear about recruiting muscle fibers,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s recruiting more neurons</p>
<p>to recruit more muscle fibers.</p>
<p>And what you find is that heavy weight training,</p>
<p>but not weight training to failure</p>
<p>where completion of a repetition is impossible</p>
<p>leads to the greatest increases in testosterone.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m sure there are a bunch of exercise jockeys</p>
<p>out there that are going to, you know,</p>
<p>come at me with a bunch of things where,</p>
<p>oh yeah, but high volume and this</p>
<p>and training to failure and that, sure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to kind of put things side by side,</p>
<p>adjust for exogenous testosterone treatment</p>
<p>and all the rest, which was done in these studies,</p>
<p>what you find in general is that weight training</p>
<p>with heavy loads, so anywhere from one rep maximum</p>
<p>to somewhere in the, you know,</p>
<p>six to eight repetition range in males or females</p>
<p>increases testosterone significantly.</p>
<p>And it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours.</p>
<p>And the studies that I found,</p>
<p>which seem to hold the most rigor or weight</p>
<p>based on where they&rsquo;re published</p>
<p>as opposed to being published in the journal,</p>
<p>never heard of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re published in good quality</p>
<p>exercise physiology journals.</p>
<p>For instance, the paper by Ratames, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al,</p>
<p>which was published in 2005,</p>
<p>which talks about modulations in androgen receptor content</p>
<p>after heavy resistance exercise,</p>
<p>looks at going to failure, not to failure.</p>
<p>The work of Sciardo et al, published in 2006,</p>
<p>differential effects of strength training</p>
<p>leading to failure versus not failure</p>
<p>on hormonal responses, strength and power gains.</p>
<p>You know, there are a lot of studies here</p>
<p>and I will certainly put the links to these in the caption.</p>
<p>Many of these actually include Duncan French</p>
<p>who runs the UFC training center,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of meeting</p>
<p>and discussing some of this with before,</p>
<p>as well as other authors, of course.</p>
<p>But they all point to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about the engagement of the neurons</p>
<p>that recruit high threshold motor units in muscle</p>
<p>when moving heavy loads, but not to failure,</p>
<p>that has to provide some sort of feedback signal</p>
<p>either to the gonad to produce more testosterone</p>
<p>or is increasing the activity of receptors in the body.</p>
<p>Now, why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, this is the puzzle, right?</p>
<p>How is it that a particular movement,</p>
<p>just like how is it that interacting with your child</p>
<p>is increasing or decreasing testosterone?</p>
<p>This is the kind of fundamental question</p>
<p>at the mechanistic level.</p>
<p>And we answered the question for child rearing,</p>
<p>has probably something to do with smell and pheromones,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure there are other cues as well,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s clearly a influence of hard work</p>
<p>at the neural level and then at the muscular level</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also clearly an effect of working too hard</p>
<p>and presumably increasing cortisol too much,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m speculating there,</p>
<p>in terms of reducing testosterone.</p>
<p>And so the reason we&rsquo;re getting nitty gritty about this</p>
<p>is because ultimately we&rsquo;d really like to understand</p>
<p>what are the optimal protocols?</p>
<p>You know, out there in the literature,</p>
<p>you hear move heavy objects to increase testosterone.</p>
<p>Some of that will be converted</p>
<p>to the more powerful androgen, DHT,</p>
<p>by 5-alpha reductase, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we really don&rsquo;t understand yet</p>
<p>how these particular behaviors increase testosterone</p>
<p>and whether or not it&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>by modulating the receptors</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s modulating testosterone release directly,</p>
<p>presumably testosterone release directly</p>
<p>and sensitivity of the receptors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what most of the muscle physiology studies</p>
<p>that I was able to find point to.</p>
<p>But this basically boils down</p>
<p>to a particular set of protocols</p>
<p>where if you want to increase testosterone</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>that weight training with heavy loads,</p>
<p>but not to failure seems to be the best supported,</p>
<p>at least scientifically supported solution to that.</p>
<p>Now, it may not raise your testosterone levels</p>
<p>as high as you want,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely taking things in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Now, many of you might be endurance athletes</p>
<p>or also enjoy exercise besides heavy weight-bearing exercise</p>
<p>and there are several studies exploring</p>
<p>whether or not endurance activity</p>
<p>can increase or decrease androgen levels</p>
<p>and whether or not you combine endurance activity</p>
<p>and weight training,</p>
<p>whether or not that has any effect</p>
<p>if you do the endurance activity first or second.</p>
<p>And the takeaway from all of this</p>
<p>was that endurance activity, if performed first,</p>
<p>leads to decreases in testosterone</p>
<p>during the weight training session</p>
<p>as compared to the same weight training session done first</p>
<p>followed by endurance activity.</p>
<p>In other words, if you want to optimize testosterone levels,</p>
<p>it seems to be the case that weight training first</p>
<p>and doing cardio type endurance activity afterward</p>
<p>is the right order of business.</p>
<p>Now, when these are done on separate days,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have an effect.</p>
<p>They showed no statistical interaction,</p>
<p>but it seems that if you&rsquo;re going to do these</p>
<p>in the same workout episode</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s move heavy loads first</p>
<p>then do cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of data looking specifically</p>
<p>at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone</p>
<p>and its derivatives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>sprinting, et cetera,</p>
<p>which somewhat mimics the neural activity</p>
<p>that occurs while moving heavy weight loads</p>
<p>is going to increase testosterone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ample evidence for that in the literature.</p>
<p>And that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes</p>
<p>is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone,</p>
<p>presumably by increases in cortisol.</p>
<p>But of course, the intensity of the exercise</p>
<p>is going to be important too.</p>
<p>No one ever, I don&rsquo;t think anyone really believes</p>
<p>that hiking for the three hours</p>
<p>is going to reduce your testosterone.</p>
<p>Whereas I think if one were to go out</p>
<p>and run hard for three hours,</p>
<p>that you can imagine there&rsquo;d be reductions in testosterone</p>
<p>by way of increases in cortisol.</p>
<p>And so while this area certainly needs more research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty clear that limiting the endurance exercise</p>
<p>to 75 minutes or less, not making it too intense</p>
<p>is one way to keep cortisol from going through the roof.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve talked on previous episodes</p>
<p>and there are a lot of others who have talked out there</p>
<p>about how to clamp cortisol,</p>
<p>how to keep cortisol more reduced.</p>
<p>This is also one of the reasons why you can imagine</p>
<p>that various individuals, either for competition</p>
<p>or just for their own purposes,</p>
<p>rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone,</p>
<p>not just for weight training, but for endurance exercise.</p>
<p>So this is one of the reasons why every once in a while,</p>
<p>professional cyclists will get popped</p>
<p>for performance-enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;ll get caught.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re increasing red blood cells</p>
<p>through EPO and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re also taking testosterone,</p>
<p>not because they want to be large</p>
<p>or have massively hypertrophied muscles,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re injecting testosterone,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to worry about cortisol-induced reductions</p>
<p>in testosterone.</p>
<p>They can just clamp or keep their testosterone levels high.</p>
<p>Not something I&rsquo;m recommending,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just justifying the rationale</p>
<p>for why an endurance athlete would want to do that at all.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s switch over to talking about estrogen.</p>
<p>So there are many people</p>
<p>who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels.</p>
<p>And one of the places where this shows up a lot,</p>
<p>and I get a lot of questions about, is menopause.</p>
<p>So menopause, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen</p>
<p>that is circulating in one&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>mainly because the ovary is now depleted</p>
<p>of some estrogen production of its own.</p>
<p>The eggs are not being produced.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been depleted, et cetera.</p>
<p>So menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s multifaceted,</p>
<p>probably deserves an entire episode on its own,</p>
<p>but things like hot flashes, things like mood swings,</p>
<p>things like headaches, in particular migraine headaches,</p>
<p>there can be a lot of brain fog.</p>
<p>It can be very, very disruptive for people.</p>
<p>Now you sometimes hear about andropause,</p>
<p>which is thought to be the kind of analog to menopause,</p>
<p>but menopause has certain characteristics</p>
<p>that make it a very robust phenomenon for most women.</p>
<p>Whereas for men, andropause is going to sometimes happen,</p>
<p>sometimes won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In fact, without going into the details</p>
<p>of the graphs and the data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that some men maintain levels of circulating androgens</p>
<p>that are quite high, even as similar as they were</p>
<p>in puberty and their teen years and 20s,</p>
<p>well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re optimizing a lot of other things</p>
<p>and probably genetics plays a role as well.</p>
<p>Whereas some males won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but within the female population</p>
<p>or population of individuals that have ovaries,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very stereotyped and characteristic reduction</p>
<p>in estrogen levels as the number of eggs becomes depleted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we think of as menopause.</p>
<p>So what are the various things that one can do for menopause?</p>
<p>Well, one of the most common ones</p>
<p>is that physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen.</p>
<p>So this is hormone therapy</p>
<p>where somebody takes either oral estrogen</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll use a patch or a pellet,</p>
<p>some way to secrete estradiol into the system.</p>
<p>And that has varying success depending on the individual.</p>
<p>Some people respond very well to it.</p>
<p>Other people really have challenges with it.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of side effects associated with it</p>
<p>for some people, not others.</p>
<p>In addition, there&rsquo;s a concern always</p>
<p>about supplementing estrogen</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a breast cancer background in the family</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s concern about breast cancer for any reason,</p>
<p>because a lot of those cancers are estrogen dependent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole</p>
<p>and drugs that block either aromatase</p>
<p>or block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly</p>
<p>were initially developed.</p>
<p>You see them a lot on the internet,</p>
<p>again, for all the sports folks</p>
<p>who are trying to increase testosterone, reduce estrogen.</p>
<p>But remember, those drugs were initially developed</p>
<p>as ways to prevent estrogen binding</p>
<p>to the estrogen receptor as cancer treatments.</p>
<p>So I want to be very clear, and I&rsquo;ve said this many times,</p>
<p>we always put in the caption of each episode, of course,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not a physician, I&rsquo;m not an MD.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>I profess things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to translate the scientific literature</p>
<p>and point to what might be some useful avenues</p>
<p>for exploration, but this is just for information purposes.</p>
<p>You should definitely talk to your doctor</p>
<p>about anything that I&rsquo;m talking about now</p>
<p>or in any episode for that matter.</p>
<p>So if you look at the literature on menopause</p>
<p>outside of just standard estrogen therapy,</p>
<p>there are some very interesting compounds out there</p>
<p>that have been used and that are supported</p>
<p>by quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll refer you once again</p>
<p>to this amazing website, examine.com,</p>
<p>where you can put in essentially any condition</p>
<p>or any supplement, and it will point you</p>
<p>to the human effect matrix, not animal studies,</p>
<p>but human studies that have explored these things.</p>
<p>Now, there are a huge variety of them here,</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t go into all of them,</p>
<p>but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds</p>
<p>that have been shown to be powerful</p>
<p>in the context of menopause, as well as other conditions</p>
<p>where estrogen is lower than one would like,</p>
<p>include a description and some of the literature,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get into this in a moment</p>
<p>of something like black cohosh.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the correct pronunciation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally the word black and then C-O-H-O-S-H.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>There are 13 peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that have reached prominence</p>
<p>in the kind of commercial landscape</p>
<p>where this substance, black cohosh,</p>
<p>has been promoted as a way to increase estrogen.</p>
<p>Turns out that the effects are consistent,</p>
<p>but are fairly minor,</p>
<p>fairly minor increases in estrogen.</p>
<p>So it does seem to be a real effect.</p>
<p>It is significant over the placebo effect,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a significant placebo effect</p>
<p>in some of these studies as well.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting when you look at these studies</p>
<p>is that many of them were carried out</p>
<p>over a period of six-plus months.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re double-blind studies, et cetera,</p>
<p>and almost all of them led to modest increases in estrogen</p>
<p>and modest decreases in menopause-related symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, a few additional details about these studies.</p>
<p>They were generally carried out on women age 45 to 64.</p>
<p>In some cases, they looked specifically at women</p>
<p>that were clinically obese or overweight,</p>
<p>although not always.</p>
<p>The subject size pools are pretty big,</p>
<p>anywhere from 50 to 87.</p>
<p>These are decent size, 132 subjects, et cetera.</p>
<p>So these look to be like quality studies,</p>
<p>and they basically point to the fact</p>
<p>that black cohosh can have a modest effect</p>
<p>in improving menopause symptoms.</p>
<p>The other one is Panax ginseng.</p>
<p>So P-N-A-A-X ginseng has been shown</p>
<p>to decrease some symptoms associated with menopause,</p>
<p>mostly related to libido,</p>
<p>although the other effects were unreliable.</p>
<p>Other things like maca,</p>
<p>which is known to increase dopamine, actually,</p>
<p>had minor effects.</p>
<p>Things like, the names here are a little hard to pronounce,</p>
<p>so forgive me, things like Valeriana officinalis</p>
<p>has shown that there can be some improvement</p>
<p>in the hot flash symptoms</p>
<p>and some of the insomnia associated with that.</p>
<p>So that might be worth exploring.</p>
<p>Again, discuss with your doctor.</p>
<p>But these were both 100 subject</p>
<p>plus age 45 to 64 individuals,</p>
<p>double-blind, placebo-controlled studies</p>
<p>that showed significant but modest effects.</p>
<p>There was one substance in the gallery</p>
<p>of the compounds that was looked at</p>
<p>that turns out to be particularly interesting,</p>
<p>and this one is also particularly difficult to pronounce,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pruraria mirifica.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to spell this out for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A,</p>
<p>pruraria mirifica,</p>
<p>M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A.</p>
<p>And there are four studies on this compound</p>
<p>that show, in every case, it to be very potent,</p>
<p>in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,</p>
<p>estrogen replacement therapy,</p>
<p>in reducing the symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p>So this was pretty striking</p>
<p>because when you go through these studies</p>
<p>and you look, again, they seem to be pretty well-controlled,</p>
<p>as far as I could tell,</p>
<p>and they explored a pretty wide subject pool,</p>
<p>and it seems that every single one of these studies,</p>
<p>when looking side-by-side at pruraria mirifica,</p>
<p>which is also called,</p>
<p>now this is really hard to pronounce, kuau kurukau,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the name that they use in various countries,</p>
<p>that it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy.</p>
<p>So I mention this because a lot of people contacted me</p>
<p>and said, what about the insomnia in menopause?</p>
<p>What about the headaches in menopause?</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you run out</p>
<p>and immediately start taking any of these compounds.</p>
<p>Please talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Any hormone-related compound is a serious consideration</p>
<p>because of the relationship to breast cancers.</p>
<p>But just in general, these compounds are,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone are exceedingly powerful</p>
<p>in terms of controlling our mental and physical states.</p>
<p>And so you want to approach them with caution.</p>
<p>But I thought that that one in particular was interesting</p>
<p>and for which there are quite a few PubMed-documented,</p>
<p>peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s talk about the role of specific compounds,</p>
<p>some of which, many of which</p>
<p>can be taken in supplementation form</p>
<p>or extracted from diet and nutrition</p>
<p>in order to optimize sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>And again, I just want to emphasize</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not suggesting anyone take anything</p>
<p>or stop taking anything.</p>
<p>This is purely for informational purposes,</p>
<p>but some of the data on these</p>
<p>is quite striking and impressive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that certain collections of nutrients</p>
<p>are useful for promoting testosterone and estrogen production</p>
<p>in their proper ratios.</p>
<p>And those things are what I would call</p>
<p>the sort of usual suspects.</p>
<p>Vitamin D, which is important</p>
<p>for so many biological functions,</p>
<p>including endocrine functions, zinc, magnesium, et cetera.</p>
<p>And if you want to look into this more deeply</p>
<p>and you want to understand exactly</p>
<p>what the negative effects are</p>
<p>of not having sufficient zinc, magnesium,</p>
<p>and what those levels might actually be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a paper that&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>You can go on PubMed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pronounce this last name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, it looks to me like Wrzosek,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s W-R-Z-O-S-E-K.</p>
<p>I hope I didn&rsquo;t butcher that too badly.</p>
<p>Wrzosek et al., 2020 in Endocrinology and Metabolism Review.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a recent paper in a good peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>It talks mainly about how</p>
<p>the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis</p>
<p>and the sex steroid hormones are negatively impacted</p>
<p>by deficiencies in magnesium,</p>
<p>deficiencies in vitamin D, and deficiencies in zinc.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&rsquo;t point to the levels</p>
<p>that one should take in order to optimize.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t say take X amount of zinc</p>
<p>or X amount of magnesium or X amount of vitamin D.</p>
<p>For that information, because it&rsquo;s so context-dependent</p>
<p>and individual-dependent,</p>
<p>I highly recommend you go to examine.com.</p>
<p>You can put in zinc or magnesium or vitamin D,</p>
<p>and they will give you ranges of dosages</p>
<p>that are supported by specific studies.</p>
<p>Again, that information is completely free to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very useful in figuring that out.</p>
<p>I personally have supplemented with zinc, magnesium,</p>
<p>and vitamin D for years,</p>
<p>but many other people do that as well.</p>
<p>And the question is always how much,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a proponent of getting blood work done,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you know whether or not</p>
<p>your androgen levels,</p>
<p>as well as things like vitamin D levels, et cetera,</p>
<p>are sufficiently high.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from these studies,</p>
<p>looking at what deficiencies cause</p>
<p>in terms of deficits in testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>really point in the direction of,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re getting adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3,</p>
<p>unless you want these steroid hormone levels</p>
<p>to be reduced for whatever reason.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s been shown time and time again</p>
<p>to have very negative effects on sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone mainly in men,</p>
<p>estrogen mainly in women, is opioids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole issue, of course,</p>
<p>of the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deserving of an entire episode</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to talk about that</p>
<p>with experts in addiction</p>
<p>and people that treat pain and so forth.</p>
<p>But the opioids dramatically reduce levels</p>
<p>of testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors</p>
<p>on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.</p>
<p>These neurons within the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that communicate to the pituitary.</p>
<p>And in fact, people that take large amounts of opioids</p>
<p>or even take low levels of opioids</p>
<p>for long periods of time</p>
<p>will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown over and over again.</p>
<p>Gynecomastia or male breast development in males,</p>
<p>disruptions to the ovary in females.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a quite terrible situation.</p>
<p>So excessive opioids are very problematic</p>
<p>for sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone will have any trouble</p>
<p>finding any literature on that.</p>
<p>You can just go into PubMed.</p>
<p>You can put opioids, testosterone or opioids, estrogen.</p>
<p>But the major effect is actually way up in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>to shut down the production of GnRH,</p>
<p>the very hormone that stimulates</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen release.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an entire industry devoted to supplements</p>
<p>and various things that people can take</p>
<p>to increase testosterone.</p>
<p>Some of which have scientific data to support them.</p>
<p>Some of which do not.</p>
<p>And some of which have anecdotal support</p>
<p>and some of which do not.</p>
<p>And this ranges so broadly.</p>
<p>I mean, things like the material off deer antlers,</p>
<p>which is high in supposedly IGF-1,</p>
<p>which is in the growth hormone pathway,</p>
<p>all the way to actual consumption of bull testes.</p>
<p>You can go on Amazon right now.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t suggest that you do this.</p>
<p>And you can actually buy ground up testes from cows.</p>
<p>And you can consume those.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of that&rsquo;s going to be broken down in the gut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting you do that.</p>
<p>But just to point out, this is a huge and vast literature.</p>
<p>And it actually dates back hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Even though testosterone wasn&rsquo;t discovered</p>
<p>that long ago as a specific hormone molecule</p>
<p>and characterized and then re-synthesized,</p>
<p>it has a huge industry</p>
<p>because of the powerful effects that it has.</p>
<p>Likewise with estrogen,</p>
<p>the development of the birth control pill</p>
<p>was only made possible</p>
<p>by understanding the structure of estrogen and estradiol.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk all about birth control</p>
<p>and how it works</p>
<p>and its influence on various other pathways</p>
<p>in a future episode.</p>
<p>But there are these supplement compounds</p>
<p>that are supported by the scientific literature</p>
<p>in terms of their ability to adjust androgens,</p>
<p>things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>One of the ones that has really good evidence for it</p>
<p>is creatine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that something about creatine,</p>
<p>although the mechanism isn&rsquo;t exactly clear,</p>
<p>either increases 5-alpha reductase</p>
<p>or makes the testosterone molecule more susceptible</p>
<p>to certain enzymatic reactions</p>
<p>that leads to increases in DHT.</p>
<p>DHT, dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>as I mentioned in the previous episode,</p>
<p>has this dramatic role</p>
<p>in creating a kind of masculinization</p>
<p>of the brain prenatally.</p>
<p>It also defines the primary sex characteristic</p>
<p>of the growth of the penis, et cetera.</p>
<p>And beyond infancy and early childhood and later in life,</p>
<p>it has powerful effects in creating balding,</p>
<p>in beard growth, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor</p>
<p>than does testosterone.</p>
<p>So creatine can increase DHT,</p>
<p>which means that if you take creatine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very DHT susceptible,</p>
<p>then you might experience some hair loss.</p>
<p>This has been heavily debated.</p>
<p>Does creatine cause baldness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on how much 5-alpha reductase you have</p>
<p>and how prone to hair loss you are.</p>
<p>Some people can take creatine without any problem</p>
<p>in terms of hair loss.</p>
<p>Some people cannot.</p>
<p>They start losing their hair to levels</p>
<p>that at least for them aren&rsquo;t comfortable.</p>
<p>There are a few other things that can increase testosterone</p>
<p>and it has to do with the way that testosterone exists</p>
<p>in its free and its bound form.</p>
<p>So testosterone, the molecule is kind of total testosterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually what&rsquo;s measured.</p>
<p>This is the kind of levels</p>
<p>that are typically thrown around</p>
<p>of anywhere from 300 to 900 being the kind of natural range</p>
<p>and then super physiological getting up</p>
<p>into 1200, 1600 range.</p>
<p>But testosterone isn&rsquo;t just roaming around free in the blood.</p>
<p>At least most of it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most of it is bound to either sex hormone binding globulin,</p>
<p>SHBG, or to albumin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re needed as transporters to get testosterone</p>
<p>into cells so that testosterone can have its effects</p>
<p>on gene expression as well as other pathways</p>
<p>within the cells.</p>
<p>So people talk about that the level of free testosterone</p>
<p>is really what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>and that you want to optimize free testosterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a tricky statement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s not really reflective</p>
<p>of a thorough understanding</p>
<p>of how these binding globulins work.</p>
<p>Remember these binding globulins aren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>to soak up all your testosterone</p>
<p>just to make it hard for you to free up testosterone</p>
<p>and make gains in the gym or whatever it is</p>
<p>or have increases in libido.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to actually transport testosterone</p>
<p>to specific tissues, to shuttle them to specific tissues</p>
<p>and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not all unbound at once.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always interesting to look in the literature</p>
<p>and see how everyone wants to free up their testosterone</p>
<p>so that it can work.</p>
<p>But sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>can bind up too much testosterone</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s having negative effects on libido</p>
<p>or on muscle growth and fat loss and things of that sort.</p>
<p>This is true in males and females</p>
<p>or it can be doing exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do</p>
<p>which is shuttling testosterone</p>
<p>to the proper tissues and organs</p>
<p>where it has all these effects, including the brain.</p>
<p>So there are supplements in particular Tonga Ali</p>
<p>which has this other name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve called Tonga Ali.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s called and these,</p>
<p>forgive me that it&rsquo;s hard to pronounce</p>
<p>but uricoma longifolia jack.</p>
<p>They always seem to have these names</p>
<p>that kind of allude to androgenic features.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know why longifolia jack.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of obvious</p>
<p>why that sounds sort of androgenic.</p>
<p>This has been shown in several studies</p>
<p>and you can find these on examine.com</p>
<p>or you can go to PubMed if you like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at these.</p>
<p>That it does seem to have some pro-fertility,</p>
<p>pro-free testosterone and subtle aphrodisiac effects.</p>
<p>It does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen.</p>
<p>So the reports of this are people take this</p>
<p>anywhere from 400 to 800 milligrams a day.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And there is some decent scientific literature</p>
<p>to support the fact that it liberates</p>
<p>some of the bound testosterone</p>
<p>and allows more free testosterone to be available.</p>
<p>Some of the reported quote unquote side effects</p>
<p>are things like excessive alertness and insomnia</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s taken too late in the day and so forth.</p>
<p>But I encourage you to explore that further</p>
<p>if increasing free testosterone</p>
<p>is something that you&rsquo;re interested in doing.</p>
<p>Examine.com includes a lot of other things</p>
<p>that can increase testosterone.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s been purported</p>
<p>to free up testosterone in the blood</p>
<p>are things like nettles, stinging nettles.</p>
<p>Although I should point out</p>
<p>that the literature points to stinging nettle</p>
<p>also having some fairly potent effects</p>
<p>on the prostate and on the liver.</p>
<p>And so it might be a tricky molecule</p>
<p>and maybe not an attractive one for people to take.</p>
<p>So we talked about creatine.</p>
<p>We talked about Tonga Ali.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that boron, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I think boron comes from,</p>
<p>I think these were like meteors that landed on earth</p>
<p>that now they extract boron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these crazy stories that when you look at it,</p>
<p>you go, how could that possibly be?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>That boron, there&rsquo;s some scientific support</p>
<p>for it freeing up more testosterone.</p>
<p>And again, freeing up testosterone</p>
<p>may be exactly what you want.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that we should demonize</p>
<p>these carrier proteins like albumin and SHBG.</p>
<p>In fact, albumin is very important for testosterone</p>
<p>to be able to make it into the brain</p>
<p>to have some of the proandrogenic effects</p>
<p>on the cognitive effects of testosterone.</p>
<p>Because in both males and females,</p>
<p>testosterone can shift these behaviors</p>
<p>like mate-seeking, reductions in anxiety and so forth</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>only by making it into the brain.</p>
<p>And there is this thing called the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>which is fascinating and deserving of entire episode also.</p>
<p>And getting molecules across the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>which are lipophilic and can pass through cell membranes,</p>
<p>requires carriers.</p>
<p>And those carriers often are bound to or include albumin.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the goal to free up all your testosterone,</p>
<p>but getting free testosterone into a range</p>
<p>that works for your particular goals and needs</p>
<p>is an attractive one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re discussing these particular tools.</p>
<p>The amounts of boron that people take,</p>
<p>and you can find this again on PubMed or examine,</p>
<p>but people take a couple grams of it a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any specific side effects,</p>
<p>but you always, always, always want to examine</p>
<p>for the particular side effects.</p>
<p>And people with different backgrounds and conditions,</p>
<p>as we talked about for menopause and estrogen,</p>
<p>have to be careful</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re starting to modulate hormones,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to modulate not just the tissues</p>
<p>that thrive on binding of those hormones,</p>
<p>but remember, the reason why there&rsquo;s so much breast cancer,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a reason why there&rsquo;s so much testicular cancer</p>
<p>is that any tissue that undergoes rapid reproduction</p>
<p>of particular cells.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of reproduction of cells</p>
<p>and shedding of uterine lining</p>
<p>and the reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary.</p>
<p>And in the testes, there&rsquo;s the production</p>
<p>of Lydig and Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this kind of ongoing production of sperm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why those tissues are particularly vulnerable</p>
<p>to the development of cancers.</p>
<p>And many of those cancers are androgen sensitive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why one of the major treatments</p>
<p>for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer</p>
<p>is to give anti-androgenic drugs, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a shutdown,</p>
<p>all things related to being androgenized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about trying to prevent testosterone</p>
<p>from encouraging growth of tumors.</p>
<p>So I want to really emphasize the caution there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy when thinking about optimizing estrogen</p>
<p>and testosterone to just think, oh, more is better.</p>
<p>More is definitely not better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just because they can aromatize</p>
<p>or convert into other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because cancers or any tissue</p>
<p>that has a lot of turnover of cells</p>
<p>is going to thrive on androgen,</p>
<p>anything that promotes growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to thrive on estrogen.</p>
<p>Remember, brain tissue doesn&rsquo;t turn over that much.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t really much production of new neurons.</p>
<p>Brain cancers happen, but they&rsquo;re kind of rare.</p>
<p>And when they do happen, they tend to be glial cells,</p>
<p>which have a lot of proliferation.</p>
<p>Glial cells can proliferate.</p>
<p>Adult neurons don&rsquo;t create more themselves.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t create more neurons in general,</p>
<p>except in a few places in the brain and body.</p>
<p>So any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers</p>
<p>and those tissues thrive on androgens and estrogens</p>
<p>to create more tumors.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re modulating hormones,</p>
<p>especially androgens and estrogens.</p>
<p>And in my scouring of the literature</p>
<p>and looking at kind of what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and what people are talking about,</p>
<p>and I also mean in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>one of the things that is new to me anyway,</p>
<p>probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there,</p>
<p>but, or the people that spend a lot of time</p>
<p>on YouTube videos talking about androgens,</p>
<p>are these, forgive me for butchering the name.</p>
<p>Again, are these ectosteroids.</p>
<p>So ectosteroids are molecules</p>
<p>that come from things like spinach, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that have a lot of similarity to the cholesterol molecule.</p>
<p>The one that&rsquo;s being discussed a lot out there right now</p>
<p>is something called turkosterone.</p>
<p>I wish I knew why it was called turkosterone.</p>
<p>Someone tell me why it&rsquo;s called turkosterone.</p>
<p>Does it have anything to do with turkeys?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s called turkosterone.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will know.</p>
<p>In any case, these ectosteroids</p>
<p>are similar enough to cholesterol.</p>
<p>Remember, cholesterol is the precursor</p>
<p>to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen.</p>
<p>And it appears that some of these ectosteroids</p>
<p>do have bioavailability,</p>
<p>or their metabolites are bioavailable.</p>
<p>And this was something that for many years,</p>
<p>people talked about whether or not insect hormones</p>
<p>or hormones from other species</p>
<p>could actually be used by humans,</p>
<p>or whether or not it would have any effect at all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty clear based on a study</p>
<p>that I was able to find.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper that came out in 2019.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comparative study in the Archives of Toxicology.</p>
<p>This is Eisenmann et al, I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al,</p>
<p>that talks about the ectosteroids</p>
<p>and was given in conjunction with strength training</p>
<p>or no strength training.</p>
<p>This is a 10-week intervention.</p>
<p>And their conclusion is that these ectosteroids</p>
<p>had a fairly significant, above placebo controls,</p>
<p>increases in muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy effects,</p>
<p>all the sorts of things that one would expect</p>
<p>with increases in androgen.</p>
<p>Their conclusion of this study is not my conclusion,</p>
<p>although I may or may not agree with them.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about my opinions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I want to be clear.</p>
<p>These are their words, not mine.</p>
<p>But they say that, in their words,</p>
<p>our results strongly suggest the inclusion of ectosteroids</p>
<p>in the list of prohibitive substances.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying these things are so powerful</p>
<p>that they should be on the list of banned substances,</p>
<p>which might be upsetting to some,</p>
<p>or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares?</p>
<p>The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sport</p>
<p>is a very interesting issue.</p>
<p>In fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t reveal names here, of course,</p>
<p>but what I learned recently was very surprising to me,</p>
<p>which is that many athletes in pro sports</p>
<p>are taking testosterone,</p>
<p>and they are able to do that legally,</p>
<p>not just because it&rsquo;s available by prescription,</p>
<p>but they are allowed to do that</p>
<p>under the rules of their sport,</p>
<p>in the fine print that no one, including me, had ever seen,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve had an injury.</p>
<p>So if athletes are injured,</p>
<p>then it opens up the door for certain forms</p>
<p>of testosterone augmentation</p>
<p>and other types of augmentations</p>
<p>that are not available to them if they&rsquo;re not injured,</p>
<p>which always makes me wonder now</p>
<p>when I see them getting injured,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s an attempt to get some of the support,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s absolutely no question</p>
<p>that estrogens and testosterones</p>
<p>modulate gene expression, modulate strength,</p>
<p>modulate the way the brain works,</p>
<p>modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety, et cetera.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re talking about supplementation,</p>
<p>the effects of supplementation,</p>
<p>I would say in some individuals can be quite dramatic,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re always, always, always,</p>
<p>except in extreme cases, going to be far subtler,</p>
<p>excuse me, far more subtle, to use the proper English,</p>
<p>far more subtle than would be, for instance,</p>
<p>just in injecting testosterone</p>
<p>or injecting estrogen, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I think we should just be honest and upfront about that.</p>
<p>So thus far, in terms of talking about optimizing hormones</p>
<p>and in the discussion of supplementation,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really talked about things</p>
<p>that actually affect the brain directly,</p>
<p>that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mainly been talking about things</p>
<p>that free up testosterone or that increase estrogen</p>
<p>at the level of the periphery.</p>
<p>But if you remember way back</p>
<p>to the beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>hormones are made in different locations in the body,</p>
<p>and there are hormones that promote the release</p>
<p>and the production of hormones</p>
<p>from other tissues in the body.</p>
<p>And one of the main hormones for that is luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone, again,</p>
<p>comes from the pituitary, circulates,</p>
<p>and either goes to the ovary</p>
<p>to promote various aspects of egg maturation,</p>
<p>as well as production of estrogen,</p>
<p>and to the testes to promote testosterone</p>
<p>and sperm production.</p>
<p>And the prescription version</p>
<p>of increasing luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>is something called HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>which has been synthesized</p>
<p>and is now available as a prescription drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken in various contexts for increasing fertility,</p>
<p>both by males and by females.</p>
<p>It can increase for all the reasons that now make sense.</p>
<p>It can increase sperm production.</p>
<p>It can produce ovulation frequency.</p>
<p>It can produce the number of eggs,</p>
<p>even, that are deployed in a given ovulation,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s not always a good thing.</p>
<p>It basically is pro-fertility, pro-testosterone,</p>
<p>pro-estrogen, depending on your background.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is HCG was initially synthesized,</p>
<p>collected and synthesized from pregnant women&rsquo;s urine.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, before it was synthetically made</p>
<p>and sold as a prescription drug,</p>
<p>there was actually a black market</p>
<p>for pregnant women&rsquo;s urine,</p>
<p>where people would buy the urine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that they probably just consumed it,</p>
<p>which is weird.</p>
<p>But in any case, human chorionic gonadotropin</p>
<p>is now available as a prescription drug.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the things that many people use</p>
<p>to increase testosterone or estrogen</p>
<p>for increasing fertility.</p>
<p>In some cases, I think it&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>to increase sports performance,</p>
<p>or when people have shut down their gonads</p>
<p>for whatever reason, because of excessive hormone therapies,</p>
<p>or they have some sort of,</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re actually lesions to the pituitary.</p>
<p>Sometimes people have a tumor in the pituitary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not common,</p>
<p>but among brain tumors and neural tumors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the more common ones.</p>
<p>And then you get deficiencies in LH and FSH.</p>
<p>And so people will take HCG to stimulate the gonads.</p>
<p>So there are a variety of reasons</p>
<p>why these drugs were created.</p>
<p>But there are certain supplements,</p>
<p>not many, that apparently can increase luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And one of the more well-documented ones</p>
<p>is phadogia agrestis, that&rsquo;s F-A-D-O-G-I-A,</p>
<p>separate word, A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,</p>
<p>which, at least according to the literature,</p>
<p>that I was able to find,</p>
<p>can increase levels of luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen.</p>
<p>And again, if an individual were to take phadogia agrestis,</p>
<p>what they would probably find is that</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen would increase</p>
<p>in anyone of any chromosomal or gonadal background,</p>
<p>but remember, it&rsquo;s the ratio of both.</p>
<p>So both, if someone has low estrogen, high testosterone,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they have testes, just by way of example,</p>
<p>then both of those would be expected to increase.</p>
<p>And if someone has high estrogen and low testosterone,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just say has ovaries,</p>
<p>then both of those would increase</p>
<p>by taking phadogia agrestis.</p>
<p>The side effect profile of phadogia agrestis</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really been documented, so it&rsquo;s a little unclear.</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize that</p>
<p>anytime someone&rsquo;s going to start taking supplements</p>
<p>or modifying sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>getting blood work done is extremely important</p>
<p>for safety reasons,</p>
<p>and also just to know whether or not things are working.</p>
<p>And because all of these things</p>
<p>are subject to negative feedback,</p>
<p>talked about this previously, previous episode,</p>
<p>but if testosterone goes high or too high,</p>
<p>it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>which will then shut down further testosterone production.</p>
<p>Likewise, if estrogens are going too high</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re going too high at various phases of the cycle,</p>
<p>that can start to throw off various other hormones,</p>
<p>including FSH, progesterone, LH.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle itself</p>
<p>is a just absolutely exquisite balance</p>
<p>of feedback of luteinizing hormone kept low and constant,</p>
<p>at least for the first 14 days of the cycle.</p>
<p>Then mid-cycle, there&rsquo;s a peak,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s typically when ovulation occurs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why pregnancy is most likely</p>
<p>during the middle of the 28-day cycle.</p>
<p>FSH kind of goes up and then down across the first 14 days.</p>
<p>So taking anything or really modifying one&rsquo;s estrogens</p>
<p>or testosterone on that background of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is really going to disrupt the way those things interact,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just such an exquisite feedback loop.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but you definitely want to be aware of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And blood draws are one way to do that.</p>
<p>Monitoring cycles for ovulating females</p>
<p>is another way to do that.</p>
<p>And in males, having a good window</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s going on with testosterone,</p>
<p>DHT, aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera, is just vital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really part and parcel</p>
<p>with the practice of thinking about optimizing</p>
<p>these incredible things that we call sextroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen, and testosterone, and their derivatives.</p>
<p>The list of supplements and molecules</p>
<p>that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast,</p>
<p>and I only touched on a few of these.</p>
<p>I really tried to emphasize the ones</p>
<p>for which there are human studies</p>
<p>or that have mostly human studies,</p>
<p>or maybe even just one human study.</p>
<p>There are other things out there</p>
<p>for which there are scientific data,</p>
<p>things like bulbine natalensis,</p>
<p>which definitely has support for increasing testosterone,</p>
<p>but all the studies were in rats.</p>
<p>I think there is some evidence in humans,</p>
<p>but the evidence mainly comes in the form</p>
<p>of what we call sponsored research,</p>
<p>so companies paying for research,</p>
<p>which is different than independent research</p>
<p>by people who are not biased in terms of the outcome.</p>
<p>And the reason I didn&rsquo;t throw out things</p>
<p>like bulbine natalensis is they seem</p>
<p>to have liver toxicity,</p>
<p>similar to high levels of anabolic exogenous steroids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some problems associated with them</p>
<p>that make them important to think about</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re curious about this area and the endocrinology,</p>
<p>but also somewhat precarious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one category,</p>
<p>so stuff that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of evidence in humans</p>
<p>might actually be dangerous.</p>
<p>The other category of things that has been shown</p>
<p>to improve or levels of, or increase, I should say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say improve,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s up to you whether or not you want to increase</p>
<p>or decrease estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s highly individual, how could I know,</p>
<p>are the things that are kind of housekeeping</p>
<p>for production of estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>things like magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc.</p>
<p>Those are the things that are going</p>
<p>to create an overall milieu of opportunity</p>
<p>to produce normal endogenous levels</p>
<p>rather than increasing endogenous levels further.</p>
<p>And so I really want to highlight</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a difference between taking something</p>
<p>to create a kind of backdrop of general support</p>
<p>and taking something that&rsquo;s going to create a big inflection</p>
<p>in the levels of a given hormone.</p>
<p>So once again,</p>
<p>we covered a tremendous amount of information.</p>
<p>We covered some basic science of hormones and pheromones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.</p>
<p>We talked about supplementation and behaviors,</p>
<p>competition and parenting,</p>
<p>and how all these things interact.</p>
<p>And I hope that you&rsquo;ll come away from this</p>
<p>with a deeper mechanistic understanding</p>
<p>of how the brain and body are interacting</p>
<p>to control the output and the ways</p>
<p>in which these incredible things</p>
<p>that we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll also come away with some ideas</p>
<p>of things that you can do in particular behavioral practices</p>
<p>that can improve sleep and your relationship</p>
<p>to light, et cetera,</p>
<p>because those things really set the foundation,</p>
<p>not just for healthy steroid hormone output,</p>
<p>but for all sorts of health effects</p>
<p>and for both the psychology</p>
<p>and the biology of your nervous system.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many questions.</p>
<p>There are many things that I couldn&rsquo;t get to today.</p>
<p>I do try and limit these episodes to about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>which is the optimal ultradian cycle for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve timestamped everything for you.</p>

<p>In closing, I hope you&rsquo;ll leave today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>with a much richer understanding of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that control the endocrine and nervous system</p>
<p>in the context of estrogen and testosterone,</p>
<p>as well as take away various tools</p>
<p>that you might choose to apply.</p>
<p>And next week, we&rsquo;ll be back with another episode</p>
<p>about the role of hormones</p>
<p>and its important interactions with the nervous system.</p>
<p>And that will, of course,</p>
<p>include both mechanisms and tools as well.</p>
