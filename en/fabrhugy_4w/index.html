<p>multivitamin or we grow wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder and unfortified yeast and if you</p>
<p>do recommend wheatgrass and yeast is one</p>
<p>serving enough for the day good question</p>
<p>now the wheatgrass juice powder is is</p>
<p>kind of a little different it does have</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals but the main thing</p>
<p>that we Krass has is all the</p>
<p>phytonutrients which I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>actually in the process of doing a an</p>
<p>analysis on the phytonutrients all those</p>
<p>powerful antioxidants that have huge</p>
<p>effects on vision brain function</p>
<p>cognitive and health tons of chlorophyll</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a healer so that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>different than multivitamin</p>
<p>multi-mineral so when looking for a</p>
<p>general multivitamin multi-mineral the</p>
<p>main thing you want to get is you want</p>
<p>to get a food base one that has comes</p>
<p>from food because you look at the back</p>
<p>of label got to make sure they list the</p>
<p>actual food it come</p>
<p>from so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s important now as</p>
<p>far as the the vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>from the electrolytes for example that</p>
<p>would be that would handle all your</p>
<p>minerals and the trace minerals of</p>
<p>course you know if your hair is going</p>
<p>bad or your nails or your skin you can</p>
<p>always add some additional plant-based</p>
<p>trace minerals the nutritional yeast is</p>
<p>something that always comes up it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great source of B vitamins I have</p>
<p>recently released a video this morning</p>
<p>some of you already asked questions on</p>
<p>that because you want to get a non</p>
<p>fortified one and you can find it online</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple brands</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sera foods the problem is</p>
<p>consuming it in a spoon it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>chewy it&rsquo;s hard to eat I did create one</p>
<p>right here this is a new release</p>
<p>nutritional yeast tablets the nice thing</p>
<p>about this one is it has its unforced</p>
<p>non fortified and it&rsquo;s in a tablet so</p>
<p>you get to swallow it and there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>any chemicals in it it just has the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast concentrate I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>to cram as much as I could into the one</p>
<p>tablet I added some natural b12 so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real complete food base b12 so hope</p>
<p>that incident okay good question hey</p>
<p>Brian you are from Maryland go ahead you</p>
<p>had a question about net carbs right</p>
<p>yeah um I had recently done well a</p>
<p>couple years ago done a keto diet where</p>
<p>I did absolutely no carbs whatsoever and</p>
<p>I mean I did very well I lost about a</p>
<p>hundred pounds um bad habits</p>
<p>unfortunately got me back and I know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not healthy to do that so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been trying to get carbs from vegetables</p>
<p>but should I be doing net carbs should I</p>
<p>be doing total carbs what exactly is</p>
<p>your view on that Brian that is an</p>
<p>awesome question so let me just cover</p>
<p>that because there&rsquo;s a confusion because</p>
<p>in in keto you want to do 5% carbs so</p>
<p>that eliminates a lot of cars especially</p>
<p>the vegetable carbs so my whole thing my</p>
<p>tweak to the ketogenic diet is that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to factor in the vegetable</p>
<p>carbs okay we don&rsquo;t want to factor it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about all the other carbs</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do hummus there&rsquo;s some you</p>
<p>know chickpea in there so you know you</p>
<p>can rate that let&rsquo;s say you do a small</p>
<p>amount of berries in your kale straight</p>
<p>okay count that that&rsquo;s the five percent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the twenty grams but you want to</p>
<p>be an unlimited vegetables why because I</p>
<p>mean if you do keto without large</p>
<p>quantities of vegetable you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to end up with</p>
<p>nutritional deficiencies you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have a hard time converting to</p>
<p>fat-burning and doing it long term</p>
<p>because the amount of waste that comes</p>
<p>from ketogenic diets I mean you do have</p>
<p>a lot of ketones or assic acid so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna change the pH of your body so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to get rid of some of</p>
<p>that acid waste in the in the pathway of</p>
<p>these acids we release a lot of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called nitrogen and that could lead</p>
<p>potentially to the kidney stone or</p>
<p>specifically uric acid stones or gout so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all that protein coming out or</p>
<p>the uric acid coming out as the which is</p>
<p>one of the byproducts of a protein</p>
<p>metabolism in general especially when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re converting protein into fuel so</p>
<p>the point is that you want to go seven</p>
<p>to ten cups of vegetable or a good</p>
<p>amount of actual you know salad so you</p>
<p>want to combine salad and vegetable</p>
<p>together to get at least seven you know</p>
<p>even more I do consistently over ten you</p>
<p>can do try less and see how you feel but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna kind of keep the fat</p>
<p>flowing through your liver and out of</p>
<p>your body it&rsquo;s going to keep the</p>
<p>nutrients in your body you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>a lot better</p>
<p>even to metabolize the protein on your</p>
<p>muscle and your hair and your nails and</p>
<p>your collagen you can&rsquo;t do without</p>
<p>potassium and yeah you can take a</p>
<p>supplement but you also have to get it</p>
<p>from vegetables there are people that</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t like vegetables I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to tell you other than you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to figure that out you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to enhance it but you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to find some vegetable to consume but</p>
<p>yeah that way you&rsquo;ll feel better</p>
<p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s will be better you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>heal insulin resistance faster you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to do it longer and you won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the bad breath less adaptation side</p>
<p>effects alright thanks Bryan hey kitty</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from California you had a</p>
<p>question about the eating plan go ahead</p>
<p>yes thank you dr. Berg it&rsquo;s very nice</p>
<p>to talk to you you do a very good</p>
<p>service</p>
<p>I really am finding that I need a plan a</p>
<p>plan would work better for me than just</p>
<p>deciding okay today I&rsquo;m going to eat bla</p>
<p>bla bla</p>
<p>yeah do you have understand you you have</p>
<p>a new thing that you&rsquo;ve released or</p>
<p>supplement to your other book yeah so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real a quick a quick plan it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right here it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a little booklet</p>
<p>this is basically a companion to this</p>
<p>book right here you can get these</p>
<p>separately on Amazon you can get a mine</p>
<p>Kindle you can get them if you go to my</p>
<p>website you get these together so you</p>
<p>get this free okay so you can decide</p>
<p>this kind of is everything you need to</p>
<p>know this is the nitty-gritty of a jump</p>
<p>start you can get through it in an hour</p>
<p>it has a lot of pictures I like books of</p>
<p>pictures but do not just go right to the</p>
<p>eating plan at least read the beginning</p>
<p>apart because you need to understand why</p>
<p>it works and how it works and then go</p>
<p>right to the eating plan so this is what</p>
<p>you need to get if you really just want</p>
<p>to get this go ahead and get it but this</p>
<p>will give you you can&rsquo;t just get this by</p>
<p>itself on my website you can go to</p>
<p>Amazon and get it but you can get them</p>
<p>together but the point is that this one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not lose weight get healthy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good healthy to lose weight this is like</p>
<p>a real nice plan to just get you</p>
<p>jump-started I think that would be the</p>
<p>best thing to do because that way you</p>
<p>have references you see pictures of the</p>
<p>actual foods the ideal scene as far as</p>
<p>what you need to eat</p>
<p>alright Kitty thanks hey Arlene you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Delaware you had a question about</p>
<p>nighttime twitching go ahead yes great</p>
<p>thanks thanks for taking my call I I</p>
<p>have a CPAP machine and I was wondering</p>
<p>how often should I clean the tubes and</p>
<p>the filters and I also have a candida</p>
<p>problem and I wanted to know what can I</p>
<p>do to get rid of that along with the</p>
<p>body twitching so I the question are you</p>
<p>doing the key to a minute fasting yet</p>
<p>yes as a matter fact what I&rsquo;m doing is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating between</p>
<p>one to two meals a day a lot of times</p>
<p>they pick one meal and I take a big</p>
<p>salad with cheese and olives and ye make</p>
<p>my own dressing yet but I use the blue</p>
<p>cheese dressing and I egg and bacon</p>
<p>group and usually the holes for me to</p>
<p>hold but if not I&rsquo;ll just have about</p>
<p>four or five hours later from two</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ll have like um a meat and</p>
<p>vegetables and I don&rsquo;t even know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough fat for me but I have been</p>
<p>moved by low okay well let me just give</p>
<p>you some data okay first of all the</p>
<p>twitching nighttime twitching that is a</p>
<p>pH problem so you just need to take a</p>
<p>little apple cider vinegar or maybe a</p>
<p>tablespoon in a little water take it</p>
<p>before bed the pH will drop the calcium</p>
<p>will start loosening up on the nerve</p>
<p>it could be underneath left eyelid</p>
<p>usually which is kind of weird there no</p>
<p>wackos there could be on the arms</p>
<p>whatever and then as you correct the pH</p>
<p>the nervous system will start working</p>
<p>better okay that usually works sometimes</p>
<p>you have to add in k2 but not usually so</p>
<p>just a little upside have been agar</p>
<p>before bed so now the other thing is</p>
<p>that you asked about the candida thing</p>
<p>and also cleaning your your CPAP machine</p>
<p>one of the best antiseptics that I know</p>
<p>of is grape seed oil</p>
<p>okay grape seed oil so you can get it</p>
<p>online and you just take a couple drops</p>
<p>mix it with water and then spray it and</p>
<p>use it as a kind of a cleaning</p>
<p>disinfecting thing it just kills</p>
<p>everything but it keeps yourself really</p>
<p>good and you can also take it orally</p>
<p>just a couple drops in some water and</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s the best thing for candy and</p>
<p>I know grape seed some people do the</p>
<p>grape seed extract I like grape seed oil</p>
<p>and it works really really good and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to get into a whole thing on</p>
<p>that but that is the best anti fungus</p>
<p>anti mold thing that you could possibly</p>
<p>imagine so you would take that but</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re doing this Keitel in a minute</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re gonna starve the mold and</p>
<p>the fungus and all in the Candida</p>
<p>because it lives on sugar so you</p>
<p>absolutely need to clean that up but as</p>
<p>you do intermittent fasting I just</p>
<p>created a video I&rsquo;m gonna release it</p>
<p>this weekend I know on a new thing</p>
<p>called etapa G which a lot of people</p>
<p>have never heard of but etapa g is the</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s ability to recycle damaged cell</p>
<p>parts so it&rsquo;s kind of like when you go</p>
<p>in a minute fasting and there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>things that trigger it you start</p>
<p>recycling all the garbage and waste in</p>
<p>your body a lot faster and replacing</p>
<p>with new cells that&rsquo;s like anti aging on</p>
<p>steroids and that&rsquo;s why in a minute</p>
<p>fasting makes you look younger</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m 29 now so I&rsquo;ve been doing it</p>
<p>for now I&rsquo;m just kidding I&rsquo;m 52 but the</p>
<p>point is that every time I do this I</p>
<p>keep it looking younger and younger</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doing this at otha G which</p>
<p>is in a minute of fasting it&rsquo;s cleaning</p>
<p>up the old bringing in the new but the</p>
<p>other thing that it does which is</p>
<p>amazing is it cleans up pathogenic</p>
<p>microbes so infected cells viruses</p>
<p>Candida mold it cleans that out of the</p>
<p>body so it just tells you that the</p>
<p>frequent meals per day is a bad idea so</p>
<p>you want to do two meals maybe one meal</p>
<p>a day and all of a sudden things start</p>
<p>you know your immune system does better</p>
<p>your sleep apnea is better you have less</p>
<p>immune problems it&rsquo;s pretty awesome</p>
<p>all right very good question hey for</p>
<p>those of you I have people that are on</p>
<p>Facebook now so I want to welcome you</p>
<p>here and thanks for spending your time</p>
<p>asking questions just realize go to</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;m on YouTube too and I</p>
<p>subscribe to my youtube channel because</p>
<p>I released two videos the morning I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to this weekend I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>return actually release one Anna tofu G</p>
<p>and another one that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>pretty awesome so you have to check it</p>
<p>out and subscribe on YouTube and then</p>
<p>those those of you that are on YouTube</p>
<p>go to Facebook I released kind of</p>
<p>sometimes different content and Facebook</p>
<p>and definitely follow me there too I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always doing different things so I would</p>
<p>love to have you go there as well</p>
<p>so David you&rsquo;re from Texas you had a</p>
<p>question about hair loss go ahead yes hi</p>
<p>great thanks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking your product for what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on the second bottle now and my</p>
<p>wife kind of noticed that I was taken</p>
<p>and she goes you know you wish and your</p>
<p>money on that because the hair follicles</p>
<p>are dead so my question is is can you</p>
<p>bring that dead follicle back to life is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing or is the follicle</p>
<p>kind of just dormant good question well</p>
<p>I have a question does balding running</p>
<p>in your family with your father your</p>
<p>grandparents uh not my father but my</p>
<p>grandfather and on my mom&rsquo;s side and you</p>
<p>know the history they say is if it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>your mom&rsquo;s side and you&rsquo;re their father</p>
<p>then if they&rsquo;re bald you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>bald so so there&rsquo;s a couple things with</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re completely bald sometimes</p>
<p>it takes honestly it doesn&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>happen in two days sometimes it takes a</p>
<p>few months to kick in I would give it</p>
<p>like three months to really test the</p>
<p>waters because in addition to one more</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m going to tell you but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always assume it&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>genetic a lot of times I&rsquo;ll have people</p>
<p>do it and all of a sudden they start</p>
<p>start seeing little tiny hairs coming</p>
<p>out where before they weren&rsquo;t one of the</p>
<p>things that will speed things up is in</p>
<p>the shower</p>
<p>you can take some coconut oil you can</p>
<p>even do olive oil and then really rub it</p>
<p>into the scalp like massage your scalp</p>
<p>really thoroughly to stimulate the</p>
<p>follicles on the hair and see if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t speed things up but it&rsquo;s I put</p>
<p>something in there one ingredient for to</p>
<p>lower something called DHT which is a</p>
<p>very powerful type of that sjostrom</p>
<p>testosterone that destroys the the hair</p>
<p>follicle so on a rare occasion you might</p>
<p>need more of that one ingredient but</p>
<p>normally not that would be the stinging</p>
<p>nettle root so those are things I would</p>
<p>I would do and I mean if it&rsquo;s not if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeing anything within the</p>
<p>third month and you know could be</p>
<p>genetic but I would do those things and</p>
<p>just give it a little bit more time and</p>
<p>see what happens David thanks for</p>
<p>calling</p>
<p>Margaret you&rsquo;re from Texas you had a</p>
<p>question about Quito go ahead hi hi dr.</p>
<p>Berg you mother and adopted to</p>
<p>exclusively breastfeed and been</p>
<p>encouraged to intake oats and grains for</p>
<p>milk objection I found that it works but</p>
<p>how do I maintain a keto diet with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting the baby is very</p>
<p>gassy when I take in green vegetables</p>
<p>what are your dietary recommendations</p>
<p>any supplements I should take and I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>also like to add that I think I have</p>
<p>PCOS but after 17 years and following</p>
<p>the keto diet you recommended I became</p>
<p>pregnant with no fertility treatment so</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you thank you for that</p>
<p>I feel really blessed about that and I</p>
<p>just went to my OBGYN and this weekend</p>
<p>just informed after 6 weeks that my</p>
<p>teachers just seemed to be happy you</p>
<p>have been suppressed so again I want to</p>
<p>give thank you about that but I do want</p>
<p>some help I want to keep the keto diet</p>
<p>but a lot of times I so rabbit is like I</p>
<p>want to eat everything that&rsquo;s in sight</p>
<p>and a lot of times I&rsquo;m hungry so I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really been maintaining keto</p>
<p>diet since I&rsquo;ve had her and but I do try</p>
<p>to take in the veg so like I said she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very gassy almost colicky that she just</p>
<p>is so upset so I just wanted to see if</p>
<p>you might be able to help me with that</p>
<p>thank you so much sure okay Margaret so</p>
<p>this is what you do you&rsquo;re gonna first</p>
<p>of all definitely don&rsquo;t do two meals if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hungry like that do three meals</p>
<p>and just start increasing a little bit</p>
<p>more fat at the end of the meal if you</p>
<p>need the snack go for it I don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you to be hungry because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to you&rsquo;re polling a lot of</p>
<p>nutrients and your body&rsquo;s telling you I</p>
<p>need more nutrients so you you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to maybe supplement with certain</p>
<p>supplements but the point is that if</p>
<p>your baby is colicky and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something some gas going on usually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the vegetables so you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>switch up the vegetables and probably</p>
<p>not have as many cruciferous if at all I</p>
<p>would do regular salad things and test</p>
<p>different things to see find out what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be because apparently your</p>
<p>baby doesn&rsquo;t have the enzymes you have</p>
<p>to digest as you know fibers that are</p>
<p>coming the nutrition that&rsquo;s coming right</p>
<p>from your milk and the fibers aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>coming but the immune stamp that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sensitivity there could be coming</p>
<p>through there so I would just switch up</p>
<p>your vegetables that you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>very few people have an allergy to</p>
<p>romaine lettuce maybe tried that also</p>
<p>tries some sauerkraut which is a</p>
<p>fermented vegetable now to get the</p>
<p>breast milk really fortified do the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast you can get this or</p>
<p>get a powder you could get brewers these</p>
<p>too but the nutritional yeast works the</p>
<p>same and that will definitely enhance</p>
<p>the breastfeeding and and the baby will</p>
<p>be very very happy but I&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breastfeeding and I think that by</p>
<p>doing the keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>that lowered your insulin which actually</p>
<p>helped polycystic ovarian syndrome which</p>
<p>then made you fertile so it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>working you just need to tweak it thanks</p>
<p>Margaret</p>
<p>okay so also for those of you watching</p>
<p>online I want to thank you for being</p>
<p>here and my purpose is to help you so</p>
<p>you can help other people and yourself</p>
<p>so definitely press the share buttons so</p>
<p>we can get this word out and and just</p>
<p>help other people hey Victoria you are</p>
<p>on the air you&rsquo;re from Maryland you had</p>
<p>a question go ahead if you can speak to</p>
<p>the barometric pressure sensitivity that</p>
<p>some of us has with headaches and joint</p>
<p>issues etcetera yeah sure so basically</p>
<p>what you need to do is get a job as a</p>
<p>weather person to predict the weather</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be set and we can use</p>
<p>you to predict when it&rsquo;s going to rain</p>
<p>now just kidding</p>
<p>I think that a lot of people start to</p>
<p>start having joint pain and when they</p>
<p>have this pressure sensitivity the only</p>
<p>thing that I know to improve that is to</p>
<p>create more space and less inflammation</p>
<p>in the joint itself now how do we do</p>
<p>that well ketosis in a minute fasting in</p>
<p>a minute fasting will probably help you</p>
<p>more than even ketosis but do them both</p>
<p>together and then that&rsquo;s going to drop</p>
<p>your inflammation which therefore then</p>
<p>we have less itis arthritis bursitis</p>
<p>tendinitis so that&rsquo;s going to help you</p>
<p>greatly the other thing that I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to tell you that&rsquo;s connected with a lot</p>
<p>of inflammation in the joints believe it</p>
<p>or not is</p>
<p>mold in the body I would say a great</p>
<p>majority the population has high levels</p>
<p>of mold now the intermittent fasting the</p>
<p>ketosis will starve the mold but a lot</p>
<p>of times you&rsquo;ll need some like grape</p>
<p>grape seed extract to kill the mold so</p>
<p>you want to maybe find a supplement that</p>
<p>you can have that I would recommend the</p>
<p>grape seed oil that&rsquo;s a little better</p>
<p>than the extract and when you take that</p>
<p>that kind of cleans up sometimes it</p>
<p>takes between two to four weeks to kind</p>
<p>of clean up that internal environment</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen dramatic results so try</p>
<p>that and then let us know if it worked</p>
<p>thanks Victoria hey Gwen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Oklahoma you had a question</p>
<p>about joint swelling - go ahead</p>
<p>hey dr. Byrd first of all I just want to</p>
<p>say thank you very much for this program</p>
<p>because I started to her adrenal body</p>
<p>type program in July and I lost some</p>
<p>weight and I&rsquo;m very excited about that</p>
<p>but I noticed about a month ago that my</p>
<p>hands began to swell and the joints</p>
<p>became painful and my wrists became</p>
<p>painful little taken my knees and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just determined that I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>stop doing this program but I need</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s going to help with the</p>
<p>swelling in the painting because very</p>
<p>painful at night and I one doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>him to take ibuprofen just to get some</p>
<p>sleep okay so there&rsquo;s just two things</p>
<p>one thing is I&rsquo;m probably was I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to talk about this but there is</p>
<p>this this new thing that I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>a whole video on our presentation that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just blow you away and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say it&rsquo;s a amazing change with</p>
<p>stiffness and pain okay but I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to put you in a mystery and what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be but just shifting</p>
<p>gears if you&rsquo;re doing ketosis and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing in a minute faster</p>
<p>and all of a sudden this joint pain gets</p>
<p>worse what that is it&rsquo;s higher levels of</p>
<p>uric acid coming out of the body because</p>
<p>the uric acid crystals that usually are</p>
<p>in that gout form which can have it in</p>
<p>the hands and the feet or the big toe</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t really be dissolved in an</p>
<p>acid urine so here are the ketones or</p>
<p>acid so they can&rsquo;t be dissolved so you</p>
<p>build up more acid crystals so what you</p>
<p>need to do very simply is add a lot of</p>
<p>lemon juice which is citrate into your</p>
<p>water like every time you drink water</p>
<p>you add like probably 2 or 3 ounces of</p>
<p>lemon juice you start drinking that and</p>
<p>drink a little more water start flushing</p>
<p>it out the other thing is to I I</p>
<p>recommend my electrolyte powder just</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an alkaline drink</p>
<p>and it has a lot of potassium you need</p>
<p>potassium citrate that&rsquo;s gonna alkalis</p>
<p>the urine bring the pH a little higher</p>
<p>now the uric acid will chill out a</p>
<p>little bit more okay so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what you need and just have to realize</p>
<p>that keep your vegetables very very high</p>
<p>and then if you&rsquo;re doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting this is what I&rsquo;m doing now in</p>
<p>the morning I don&rsquo;t eat but you know</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll do I&rsquo;ll do a kale shake I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to do it every morning now I was</p>
<p>doing every other Monday now I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna do it once in the morning because</p>
<p>I just feel so much better when I do it</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll get up and I get up like at five</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the morning right so but I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t do the shake until like 7:00 I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do a kale shake put a little bit of</p>
<p>berry in there i blend the kid I keep</p>
<p>everything in the freezer so I it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>frozen take it out blend it up and it</p>
<p>fills up the whole blender I&rsquo;ll drink</p>
<p>that whole thing in the morning I know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like two huge things I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>drink all that but I won&rsquo;t eat until</p>
<p>like 12:30 so all that kale just</p>
<p>alkalized the urine I mean just like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kind of a human guinea pig to test</p>
<p>it out but I&rsquo;m liking what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in my body I&rsquo;m getting a tremendous</p>
<p>night I mean that&rsquo;s like all my greens</p>
<p>for the day right there but of course</p>
<p>then I have another salad so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>experimenting with all these</p>
<p>phytonutrients but I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you should try I think you&rsquo;ll see some</p>
<p>huge changes all right Quinn</p>
<p>alright so Natalie you&rsquo;re from Dover</p>
<p>Arizona you</p>
<p>question yes dr. work its Gilbert</p>
<p>Arizona oh thank you yeah thank you so</p>
<p>much we we shall enjoy watching your</p>
<p>videos and listening to you all the time</p>
<p>my fiance and I have been doing the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>for about two months now and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going great but he when he uses the keto</p>
<p>sticks he always comes up really dark</p>
<p>purple all the time and we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if that was a sign of something or</p>
<p>things were working properly and we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know if maybe we should switch to</p>
<p>the blood keto meter if that would work</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an adrenal body type so know that</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s showing up like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in heavy ketosis yeah every time</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a good thing okay well first</p>
<p>of all I want to thank you for listening</p>
<p>and following and that&rsquo;s awesome so I</p>
<p>really appreciate all of you that are on</p>
<p>the on the calls right now and also just</p>
<p>watching cuz thank you for that because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;m helping you but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s that here&rsquo;s the thing that you</p>
<p>have to realize that if you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>strong ketosis it means a lot of ketones</p>
<p>are coming through the urine that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good thing as you do it longer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see less and less of that you</p>
<p>can also alter your ketosis but or</p>
<p>ketones by adding adjusting the fat</p>
<p>level for your body so you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>little less fat and you probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have as many ketones coming out but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a bad thing</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s if he adds exercise into it a</p>
<p>little more in a minute fasting he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually probably go down in the</p>
<p>strength of the ketones coming out of</p>
<p>urine because the stronger it is it</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re really in some serious</p>
<p>about burning but it&rsquo;s being released</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting extra ketones that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not metabolizing it could also be that</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s adrenal you know the Drina Liz</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some Drina damages taking</p>
<p>longer to use the ketones more</p>
<p>efficiently so I usually get the</p>
<p>opposite question where people are</p>
<p>trying to go well I&rsquo;m not seeing any</p>
<p>ketones but I&rsquo;m losing weight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re burning up all the</p>
<p>ketones so I don&rsquo;t think I would worry</p>
<p>about it I would just keep going like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going and as long as your your</p>
<p>stomach is loose and you feel good and</p>
<p>your clothes are loose around your</p>
<p>stomach and</p>
<p>I think I think I&rsquo;ve just ride the wave</p>
<p>and keep going keep tweaking it cuz I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing great</p>
<p>alright good hey Bill you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Annapolis how you doing hi hi good</p>
<p>morning dr. Berg thank you taking my</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>sure so I have a question regarding</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s a little mixed question</p>
<p>of cholesterol and an electrolytes so I</p>
<p>recently had a an episode of atrial</p>
<p>fibrillation I went to the hospital for</p>
<p>about two weeks ago and I know that</p>
<p>atrial fibrillation has a relationship</p>
<p>with electrolytes and possibly</p>
<p>electrolyte imbalance where maybe my</p>
<p>potassium and magnesium rattle whack</p>
<p>yeah and it triggered it mm-hmm</p>
<p>while there the doctor said my lipid</p>
<p>numbers were high I had very high</p>
<p>cholesterol my LDL was higher than</p>
<p>optimal and my HDL was lower than</p>
<p>optimal triglycerides were higher I am</p>
<p>on a ketogenic diet I have been now</p>
<p>since since mid-july I had great have</p>
<p>had great results lost about 30 pounds</p>
<p>so far dropped about 5% body fat</p>
<p>my concern is my cardiologist wants to</p>
<p>put me on a statin drug lipitor and he</p>
<p>also wants me to take a daily low-dose</p>
<p>aspirin both things which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>apprehensive of doing I&rsquo;ve read and done</p>
<p>research on statin drugs and and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched some of your videos about statin</p>
<p>drugs and really not wanting to do that</p>
<p>I just wanted to get your thoughts on</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet especially regarding</p>
<p>electrolytes I know they do it it can</p>
<p>deplete you and I I think I&rsquo;m taking it</p>
<p>enough but maybe I&rsquo;m not are you also</p>
<p>doing in a minute fasting I am so I</p>
<p>usually eat my first meal around 11:30</p>
<p>or noon my second meal around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>those are the two meals the only other</p>
<p>thing I do throughout the day is I</p>
<p>usually start my day with two</p>
<p>tablespoons of apple cider vinegar okay</p>
<p>in the mornings and I actually mixed</p>
<p>that with a little bit of Himalayan salt</p>
<p>mm-hmm and how much bad okay how much</p>
<p>vegetable do you consume in a given day</p>
<p>how many cups so probably mostly comes</p>
<p>from salad from I use mixed greens</p>
<p>sometimes mixed greens with</p>
<p>spinach but I&rsquo;ve actually been adding</p>
<p>vegetables I&rsquo;ve been adding bell pepper</p>
<p>I eat at least 1/2 possibly 2 avocados a</p>
<p>day usually one with launched one with</p>
<p>dinner so that&rsquo;s why I feel like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking it enough so total cups would it</p>
<p>be 7 to 10 um probably there yeah I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard but when it comes to measuring</p>
<p>salad it&rsquo;s kind of hard because salad</p>
<p>you can pack it in there or you can kind</p>
<p>of do it loosely but I usually eat way</p>
<p>way it some times just to see how much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually eating and I&rsquo;ll eat like 6</p>
<p>ounces of salad for lunch okay okay cool</p>
<p>well first of all I want to say I love</p>
<p>you town okay I can&rsquo;t wait to visit that</p>
<p>and in the fall it&rsquo;s just simply</p>
<p>gorgeous Annapolis is just gorgeous in</p>
<p>the fall I will be going there I want to</p>
<p>check it out it&rsquo;s just a great great</p>
<p>town so it must be nice to live there</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>question and I&rsquo;m just going to give you</p>
<p>a disclaimer first everything that I say</p>
<p>to any of recommendations are not meant</p>
<p>to diagnose anyone or tell them not to</p>
<p>take medication it&rsquo;s mainly for your</p>
<p>entertainment okay so that being said</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let me give you my opinion on a</p>
<p>lot of times when you do this the fat</p>
<p>cell when you release it is kanpai it</p>
<p>has triglycerides and cholesterol so a</p>
<p>lot of times I don&rsquo;t start going up and</p>
<p>you think oh my gosh it&rsquo;s a heart</p>
<p>problem blah blah blah so there are</p>
<p>advanced type of cholesterol measuring</p>
<p>things that you can look at to really</p>
<p>look at the type type A and B pattern</p>
<p>cholesterol LDL and that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>do with you I would check this measure a</p>
<p>and B because the 8th is big and fluffy</p>
<p>the B is the dense and that&rsquo;s the more</p>
<p>the the problem area but I think healing</p>
<p>the original reason why your cholesterol</p>
<p>is high is going to be vital so the</p>
<p>arteries are very have good integrity</p>
<p>and that would be the vitamin C from the</p>
<p>from the sauerkraut which which would be</p>
<p>really good to consume but the atrial</p>
<p>fib that&rsquo;s merely a potassium magnesium</p>
<p>thing and if you get a blood test and it</p>
<p>comes up normal that means that</p>
<p>it could be intracellular not</p>
<p>extracellular so that means that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you only really only have 2% of</p>
<p>your potassium outside the cell and 98%</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s inside the cells so doing a</p>
<p>blood test really doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s worthless</p>
<p>with potassium you have to do a special</p>
<p>task called an intracellular potassium</p>
<p>test and you can look online too you</p>
<p>have to get like a little scrape of</p>
<p>yourselves you have to do analysis now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the electrolyte profile</p>
<p>inside the cell which is very very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>I would imagine yours was going to be</p>
<p>low that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t find this on a</p>
<p>blood test so let&rsquo;s assume it is low</p>
<p>I would I would take my electrolyte</p>
<p>powder and I would do probably four</p>
<p>scoops of that a day in addition to your</p>
<p>vegetables to really get the vegetable</p>
<p>the potassium high because that has all</p>
<p>the electrolytes there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>potassium and then see what happens over</p>
<p>a period of time to build up your</p>
<p>potassium levels inside the cell</p>
<p>sometimes takes months and months it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a quick thing but I will say that</p>
<p>when you do the keto and you tend to use</p>
<p>more potassium so you need more and you</p>
<p>might have been gone into this with</p>
<p>lower levels of potassium so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing the other thing is you want to add</p>
<p>exercise to this which you might be</p>
<p>already be doing and also vitamin b3</p>
<p>niacin and also red yeast would be</p>
<p>another great natural things to help</p>
<p>regulate cholesterol and help clear it</p>
<p>out and those are the things I would do</p>
<p>and then reevaluate this like each month</p>
<p>for the next few months and see if the</p>
<p>trend is getting better or worse the</p>
<p>main thing I would be interested in is</p>
<p>your triglycerides make sure those are</p>
<p>doing better and better and better than</p>
<p>not really high but I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening now you&rsquo;re just you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>getting rid of this fat and it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s being released so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming out to the liver so you just</p>
<p>have to work on keeping that liver</p>
<p>flushed all the time and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the right thing okay bill thanks</p>
<p>all right so Joanne you had question</p>
<p>from your from Charlottesville Virginia</p>
<p>your thyroid and ovaries were removed</p>
<p>yes I had thyroid cancer five six years</p>
<p>go and then ovarian cancer two years ago</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>know what mmm I started some of your</p>
<p>products I ordered the the wheatgrass</p>
<p>and the adrenal and I just wanted to</p>
<p>make sure that I&rsquo;m on the right program</p>
<p>when I did take the adrenal pills it did</p>
<p>call me down I was really amazed at that</p>
<p>and I was able to sleep better at night</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that I am</p>
<p>taking the right amount diet second week</p>
<p>it kind of made me sick on my stomach</p>
<p>mmm didn&rsquo;t have enough carbs because my</p>
<p>body seems to crave the car and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>definitely insolent with this stuff okay</p>
<p>so yeah so we got kind of a couple</p>
<p>things going on definitely there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>common denominator between the thyroid</p>
<p>and the ovaries and that would be iodine</p>
<p>seek help that&rsquo;s the one that I think</p>
<p>would benefit you all a lot and probably</p>
<p>your estrogen dominant - so the</p>
<p>cruciferous is going to be important in</p>
<p>the look like the kale shake thing so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right in the beginning of the</p>
<p>whole ketosis thing so you need to get</p>
<p>this little booklet from you know other</p>
<p>book too but this is the most important</p>
<p>thing because I kind of talk about the</p>
<p>key to adaptation phase the fact that</p>
<p>you crave means that your insulin</p>
<p>resistance so all we have to do is do</p>
<p>this correctly and support the B</p>
<p>vitamins okay here&rsquo;s some B vitamins</p>
<p>potassium the vegetables and then adjust</p>
<p>the fats between the meals so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to snack in between the meal and</p>
<p>just give it a little more time until</p>
<p>all the sudden it&rsquo;s like wow cravings</p>
<p>are going away I can do this</p>
<p>things are working and then you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>to find well I&rsquo;m not even hungry I crave</p>
<p>nothing and the insulin resistance is</p>
<p>better but I think you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>right supplements and because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working but I think you&rsquo;re missing a</p>
<p>seek help and maybe some B vitamins M</p>
<p>from the nutritional yeast and then as</p>
<p>far as you&rsquo;re eating goes just keep your</p>
<p>vegetables high and this is the whole</p>
<p>thing like I don&rsquo;t recommend doing any</p>
<p>semblance unless you&rsquo;re doing the diet</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not actually correcting</p>
<p>the real</p>
<p>so you really want to keep that</p>
<p>foundation there get the basics on that</p>
<p>and plug that in there and then adjust</p>
<p>the fast between the meal I think if you</p>
<p>did that within a week you probably</p>
<p>would be adapted</p>
<p>all right Joanne and I just want to say</p>
<p>thanks for your calls everyone and also</p>
<p>press the share button let&rsquo;s spread the</p>
<p>word to your friends family I know you</p>
<p>want to be helped but let&rsquo;s get other</p>
<p>people some help as well because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really contact all these people without</p>
<p>your help so I appreciate in advance you</p>
<p>sharing the word hey I have someone from</p>
<p>Germany it&rsquo;s I guess it&rsquo;s Ruffini Rafina</p>
<p>you had a question yeah yes my name is</p>
<p>Ravina I am a question my dad was on on</p>
<p>dialysis yes in about two years that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one right now his parathyroid is</p>
<p>overactive and the doctors want to</p>
<p>remove it or Paul so my question was is</p>
<p>there a a natural way to get rid of the</p>
<p>problem without due to the surgery yeah</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the Viers a touchy question</p>
<p>because if there&rsquo;s a tumor on the</p>
<p>parathyroid and you should search my</p>
<p>videos on parathyroid okay if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tumor on there and it&rsquo;s growing it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little more advanced okay and you might</p>
<p>need a surgery if there&rsquo;s tumors growing</p>
<p>on the parathyroid and you find a good</p>
<p>surgeon that can do it and I&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>quite a few people who I&rsquo;ve followed</p>
<p>over a period of time and they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re fine like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s not a lot of bad things that</p>
<p>happen to them out of all the different</p>
<p>surgeons you can have a person could do</p>
<p>very well because usually you have like</p>
<p>a tumor on one of the parathyroid czar</p>
<p>to them you take those out the other</p>
<p>ones can compensate so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend with that but without</p>
<p>really knowing the case without knowing</p>
<p>anything about your dad and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>medical question I would just put him on</p>
<p>the exact thing I&rsquo;m putting everyone</p>
<p>else on which is the eating plan we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about and then see what happens</p>
<p>so you think it&rsquo;s better vitamin k2 is a</p>
<p>really good one for parathyroid because</p>
<p>parathyroid glands are right behind the</p>
<p>thyroid</p>
<p>they regulate calcium but again watch</p>
<p>the videos and then get them on the</p>
<p>basic program and let&rsquo;s see what happens</p>
<p>okay thanks for calling from Germany</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome so Ryan you had a</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;re from La Crosse Wisconsin</p>
<p>awesome yeah dr. Berg thank you um I was</p>
<p>actually got into cycling to help me</p>
<p>lose some weight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m type 2 diabetic but then about six</p>
<p>seven weeks ago I started doing</p>
<p>ketogenic diet I learned a lot from your</p>
<p>videos and some others and basically my</p>
<p>question is doing long-term rides like</p>
<p>five-plus our rides I do a lot of</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;ve done to 300</p>
<p>rides without eating anything just water</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering about your</p>
<p>recommendations for a longer term five</p>
<p>six seven hours</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny us right funny you asked</p>
<p>that and they will say that my ice cream</p>
<p>manufacturing company is actually in La</p>
<p>Crosse so I went there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gorgeous I&rsquo;m from Wisconsin the</p>
<p>Kenosha Wisconsin which is on the other</p>
<p>side but a beautiful area of course in</p>
<p>the fall it&rsquo;s gorgeous but the the point</p>
<p>with the bike riding there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>movement of endurance athletes</p>
<p>long-distance runners long-distance type</p>
<p>people that do biking are doing the keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting which is</p>
<p>amazing because they found there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several studies are you know it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>actually released this on on a recent</p>
<p>video that show that your yeah you</p>
<p>become a fat-burning that oxidizing</p>
<p>machine on steroids he burns so much fat</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll have to consume more fat but</p>
<p>your body if you do this over a period</p>
<p>and you adapt your body over a period of</p>
<p>like you know six months eight months to</p>
<p>a year and you&rsquo;re really adapted your</p>
<p>system will switch over to burning fat</p>
<p>and you will not be experienced like the</p>
<p>drops that people that carbo load and</p>
<p>drop the glycogen reserve real fast and</p>
<p>hit this wall you won&rsquo;t do that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to switch over to fat burning</p>
<p>efficiently but you just have to work</p>
<p>with it so honestly what I would do is I</p>
<p>would do a search on long distance</p>
<p>athletics and ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>adaptation and</p>
<p>just get some more data on it but I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing the right thing and</p>
<p>yes you can get to a point where you</p>
<p>fully adapt you&rsquo;re burning fat and you</p>
<p>know burning that sugar anymore it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>much better fuel source I think your</p>
<p>performance will be improve because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it shows in the studies and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have some serious fat</p>
<p>burning thanks Ryan</p>
<p>Eileen you&rsquo;re from Orlando Florida go</p>
<p>ahead you had a question</p>
<p>hi good morning thank you for answering</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan my husband she I had</p>
<p>bariatric surgery a year ago and after</p>
<p>the surgery I lost it here&rsquo;s amount of</p>
<p>weight but after yeah I start getting</p>
<p>and little by little not a lot of weight</p>
<p>but you know one pound schuhe in there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I came across one of her</p>
<p>videos and I started with the in terment</p>
<p>pattern and invited my first month I</p>
<p>lost 10 pounds and you know I&rsquo;m I love</p>
<p>getting to Quito because now I start</p>
<p>with the the losing weight and I would</p>
<p>love to go on kiddo but my problem is I</p>
<p>cannot hold the huge amounts of salad in</p>
<p>the city</p>
<p>yeah well yeah I can&rsquo;t oh yeah I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand maybe my protein and shook up the</p>
<p>salad in its city but not five cups of</p>
<p>salad so my question is if I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>twin meals because my music you know not</p>
<p>a huge amount of absolute if I can snack</p>
<p>on my salad between them yeah okay good</p>
<p>question when someone is bariatric</p>
<p>surgery they had just have a smaller</p>
<p>surface area on their stomach so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a little compromise you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing some parts so what that means is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to digest 10</p>
<p>cups of salad in one sitting like myself</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to spread it out within the eating</p>
<p>window that you</p>
<p>have a salad wait a little have another</p>
<p>salad and that&rsquo;s gonna be a lot better</p>
<p>but the other thing that you should do</p>
<p>is you should do the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder because it&rsquo;s a concentrated kind</p>
<p>of a concentrated salad the nutrition</p>
<p>not counting the fiber because it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to compare wheatgrass juice powder and</p>
<p>vegetable right because the vegetables</p>
<p>have fiber this one doesn&rsquo;t but if you</p>
<p>took three and a half scoops that would</p>
<p>be equivalent to the nutrition in seven</p>
<p>cups of salad so I would definitely do</p>
<p>that because that would because the</p>
<p>problem you have is the fiber digesting</p>
<p>on the fiber but at least we can give</p>
<p>you the nutrition without the fiber and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll do you&rsquo;ll get the nutrition</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the thing that you need</p>
<p>to heal the insulin resistance and the</p>
<p>other things that you&rsquo;re running into</p>
<p>the other thing is the trace minerals</p>
<p>trace minerals is a liquid you can take</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s good for bariatric patients</p>
<p>because the the nutrients go right in</p>
<p>like a rocket ship they&rsquo;re absorbed</p>
<p>immediately and that also helps speed up</p>
<p>the metabolism and also the thing that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably really missing that</p>
<p>problem the other problem is the fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins because the stomach pH</p>
<p>has to be correct the stomach has to be</p>
<p>right for the gallbladder to work so you</p>
<p>may need to add a little gallbladder</p>
<p>formula to get your fat saga vitamins to</p>
<p>be absorbed and I think then that will</p>
<p>kick in more of the fat burning and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be fine okay all right good</p>
<p>Melissa you&rsquo;re from Nevada you had a</p>
<p>question about a couple things go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the earth honey I did marathon</p>
<p>training and I didn&rsquo;t eat enough so I go</p>
<p>out and run come back not hungry I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>maybe taken 900 calories a day but that</p>
<p>was with no fat no carbs and process no</p>
<p>sugars and that well anyways my body</p>
<p>started padding up and holding on to it</p>
<p>and after my marathon I realized I quit</p>
<p>exercising but I realized that yet ate</p>
<p>my muscle and I&rsquo;m really weak I know it</p>
<p>messed my adrenals up I&rsquo;m getting my</p>
<p>adrenals under control I&rsquo;m - I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>so much better than on the ketosis and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for like two weeks</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ve lost like seven pounds it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinned out my face I mean I feel great</p>
<p>that my big concern is</p>
<p>eat between like one and seven and only</p>
<p>two males that I&rsquo;m afraid this is my</p>
<p>body thin like an escapement cell and</p>
<p>never hungry I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting enough I am noticing weight is</p>
<p>coming off I&rsquo;m you know it&rsquo;s coming off</p>
<p>my ribs and that I keep measuring that</p>
<p>my skill isn&rsquo;t going down but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>worried about that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m concerned that I&rsquo;m not bringing</p>
<p>in enough calories and I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>kind of keep my body in the starvation</p>
<p>mode and then also when can I start</p>
<p>really exercising again I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about doing the hit because I know that</p>
<p>would just kill my body right now but it</p>
<p>might just exercise like walking lunges</p>
<p>push-ups on that during my hours of</p>
<p>eating well yeah yeah you have some</p>
<p>really good questions so let me just</p>
<p>kind of answer them I&rsquo;m going to turn to</p>
<p>page six right here in this little</p>
<p>booklet right here the definition of</p>
<p>food that which is eaten to sustain life</p>
<p>provide energy and promote the growth or</p>
<p>repair of tissues nourishment so</p>
<p>basically that&rsquo;s why we eat right so I</p>
<p>think with you you didn&rsquo;t provide enough</p>
<p>nutrients and under the with the</p>
<p>exercise there&rsquo;s been deficiency so you</p>
<p>basically kind of did avert you created</p>
<p>a starvation type thing in the body and</p>
<p>then there goes the proteins there goes</p>
<p>this because you need like minerals</p>
<p>potassium to help the muscle in fact the</p>
<p>purpose of vitamins they&rsquo;re cofactors to</p>
<p>help make body tissue so you basically</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t have enough of the right</p>
<p>things to be able to maintain the muscle</p>
<p>in the collagen and all the joint stuff</p>
<p>so now your metabolism said okay we</p>
<p>better go into a starvation mode so now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting things back things are</p>
<p>better and but you&rsquo;re not hungry so</p>
<p>instead of focusing in just on food</p>
<p>focus on nutrient density type stuff</p>
<p>like make sure you get your nutrition so</p>
<p>do the kale shakes do concentrated type</p>
<p>foods that have high levels of nutrition</p>
<p>and even though you&rsquo;re not hungry still</p>
<p>have two really big meals because you</p>
<p>were already trying to make up to damage</p>
<p>from what happened so you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to just eat those regardless if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry to get the quantity of food to</p>
<p>get the nutrients that&rsquo;s the goal so you</p>
<p>never start again</p>
<p>and I would do that for a peer</p>
<p>of time I would probably do that for</p>
<p>like three four months now</p>
<p>during probably in a maybe month from</p>
<p>now start introducing exercise on a nice</p>
<p>gradient walking slowly and then</p>
<p>gradually increase it to make sure that</p>
<p>it does not too high make sure the hair</p>
<p>is not falling out</p>
<p>make sure your protein is fine but the</p>
<p>imminent fasting is gonna help repair</p>
<p>things at otha G and I&rsquo;m gonna release</p>
<p>that video so those of you are on</p>
<p>Facebook those of you are on YouTube</p>
<p>that are not subscribed to my youtube</p>
<p>channel subscribe right now because this</p>
<p>week and I have this release of this</p>
<p>video called the tofu gene which will</p>
<p>blow you away it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a way better benefit than</p>
<p>weight loss for doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>anti-aging and stair whites without</p>
<p>taking the store ID so check that out</p>
<p>and subscribe because I want to release</p>
<p>that video I&rsquo;ll try to release it</p>
<p>tomorrow morning so it&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>alright Eastern Standard Time okay</p>
<p>Melissa thanks for the question hey Tim</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Orange County New York go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the I</p>
<p>hey good morning doctor how are you good</p>
<p>morning good morning so I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following the ketosis diet and following</p>
<p>you for about a year now pretty</p>
<p>successful with energy levels and weight</p>
<p>loss feeling great I just got some blood</p>
<p>work back from my job and I have some</p>
<p>high cholesterol numbers and I&rsquo;ve run</p>
<p>them by you for some advice yeah so are</p>
<p>you try glycerides high too or no</p>
<p>triglycerides was 139 the reference</p>
<p>range was 150 so I guess it was not okay</p>
<p>so did you ever have a test before like</p>
<p>a while ago to compare it I do annually</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have it with me okay</p>
<p>I know I was always kind of right on the</p>
<p>threshold like you know right I was kind</p>
<p>of like borderline okay this year I was</p>
<p>actually by my job that kind of said</p>
<p>like hey you better take a look at this</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s up okay and this is a very</p>
<p>important subject because I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you there&rsquo;s so much data on my</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s like a killer you go in</p>
<p>fear you take the drugs you&rsquo;re like you</p>
<p>really need to</p>
<p>understand cholesterol and I actually</p>
<p>release four videos I would highly</p>
<p>recommend reading those and/or studying</p>
<p>those and not reading and watching them</p>
<p>because they especially the ones on LDL</p>
<p>because when you do the keto and in a</p>
<p>minute fasting your cholesterol will go</p>
<p>up because think about you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>losing fat part of your fat cells are</p>
<p>cholesterol and triglyceride so how is</p>
<p>that going to come out you have to dump</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s gonna dump to the liver and your</p>
<p>liver and that might be a little fatty</p>
<p>so it might not go down at some point</p>
<p>but even people that are genetic have a</p>
<p>genetic cholesterol problem are doing</p>
<p>this with great success if you look at</p>
<p>understand these numbers and then do it</p>
<p>for a little bit longer you can actually</p>
<p>add some niacin if you want to tweak it</p>
<p>and improve things and some less than or</p>
<p>choline those are all B vitamins add</p>
<p>more vegetables outside of vinegar maybe</p>
<p>some red red yeast extract to help lower</p>
<p>cholesterol naturally if you if you feel</p>
<p>comfortable I mean if you want to do</p>
<p>that but the point is that you want to</p>
<p>give it more time and their cholesterol</p>
<p>will come down but to do this without</p>
<p>having to go up might not work</p>
<p>cholesterol actually is your body makes</p>
<p>3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every</p>
<p>single day so if it&rsquo;s so bad why does</p>
<p>our body make that much that would be</p>
<p>equivalent to 14 eggs or a pound of</p>
<p>butter or 300 strips of bacon</p>
<p>so really cholesterol is there to help</p>
<p>you and make hormones and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just releasing it and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine just give it more time</p>
<p>thanks Tim okay Mike you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Northern California go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air earlier part of the summer I did</p>
<p>like a two-month fast I started out</p>
<p>doing just juices and then moved into</p>
<p>some protein drinks and then I was doing</p>
<p>more than just doing more of the protein</p>
<p>drinks and anything and it was quality</p>
<p>protein but I&rsquo;m at one point I started a</p>
<p>quit losing weight I&rsquo;m 350 pounds I will</p>
<p>used to be a national class athlete I</p>
<p>raced bicycles on a professional level</p>
<p>and really healthy and then I had some</p>
<p>knee injuries and I watched all that so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was saying I got I about</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>two months I quit losing weight then I</p>
<p>started getting really sick I mean I was</p>
<p>throwing up and and I my wife she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>an RN for 38 years she was thinking like</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s get pain up in this my</p>
<p>gallbladder area she says it you know so</p>
<p>I started doing the the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>and the volcanic lemon juice and apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar I&rsquo;m okay but about every</p>
<p>two weeks if I&rsquo;m really not careful what</p>
<p>I eat I get sick again</p>
<p>yes far you know I I don&rsquo;t get sick I go</p>
<p>stick my finger down my throat because</p>
<p>the pain that upper my right hand side</p>
<p>of my stomach like where the gallbladder</p>
<p>is is there a way that I get that healed</p>
<p>up yeah I won&rsquo;t go to the doctor I</p>
<p>refuse to okay so let me let me explain</p>
<p>like what what&rsquo;s going on is probably</p>
<p>some sluggishness in your gallbladder</p>
<p>okay so and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s actually good</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s there I&rsquo;m gonna tell you why</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s your red light your</p>
<p>indicator light that your oil gauge is</p>
<p>off on your car and it&rsquo;s Trent your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s trying to say you know stay on</p>
<p>the program stay on the program</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go off the program or else I will</p>
<p>put you in pain i I went through that</p>
<p>myself so you really need to be a</p>
<p>hundred percent discipline on this</p>
<p>program and really start going into in a</p>
<p>minute fasting because let me think</p>
<p>about your over 300 pounds so we know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s been some abuse to</p>
<p>the digestive system the liver probably</p>
<p>fatty so here you have this weak link</p>
<p>and the gallbladder that is just going</p>
<p>to just be sitting right there to wait</p>
<p>for you to just eat a little carb or</p>
<p>something like that or too much of the</p>
<p>wrong thing and then BAM this was gonna</p>
<p>create a lot of pain which is then you</p>
<p>have to you know vomit because the</p>
<p>nauseous nauseous the symptom of</p>
<p>nauseousness</p>
<p>pain right there is definitely a</p>
<p>gallbladder problem it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt for</p>
<p>you to confront what it is by getting an</p>
<p>ultrasound to see what the heck is in</p>
<p>there let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p>stones well that should you should know</p>
<p>about that you need to do the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula that I have you need</p>
<p>to be doing the kale 6:00 in the morning</p>
<p>to start to take those nutrients to</p>
<p>flush out I would add beet leaves and I</p>
<p>think if you do that you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>fine but you just need to change your</p>
<p>viewpoint and instead of doing it</p>
<p>90% do it a hundred percent because your</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too risky to have a gall bladder</p>
<p>problem alright Mike I hope that</p>
<p>inspires you</p>
<p>okay so Jared you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Arizona yes hi there hi so I</p>
<p>started the keto diet about four months</p>
<p>ago and I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing I</p>
<p>did wasn&rsquo;t consuming potassium or</p>
<p>magnesium I believe my body was really</p>
<p>depleted about two months ago I started</p>
<p>watching your videos and I got the</p>
<p>wheatgrass I got the electrolyte powder</p>
<p>I started falling you&rsquo;re what the plan</p>
<p>you eat which is eggs and bacon doing</p>
<p>seven to ten cups of you know spinach</p>
<p>and salad a day and and then I just</p>
<p>received b5 I just started taking that</p>
<p>but my problem is I haven&rsquo;t been able to</p>
<p>sustain energy all day I&rsquo;ve been you</p>
<p>know kind of fatigued throughout the day</p>
<p>do I need to just give a time or do you</p>
<p>have any suggestions do you do have any</p>
<p>sleeping issues no no I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>sleeping issue I go right to sleep I</p>
<p>wake up okay</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;m groggy getting out of bed</p>
<p>okay and do you have any are you doing</p>
<p>in a minute fasting yeah I mean I only</p>
<p>eat about twice a day</p>
<p>yeah I would just plug in the I would</p>
<p>just do one thing and I would add the</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re already doing the</p>
<p>potassium electrolytes I would add a</p>
<p>nutritional yeast you doing the tablets</p>
<p>or the powder but that goes beyond the</p>
<p>vitamin b5 and that should take care of</p>
<p>your energy pretty quickly and then just</p>
<p>give it a little more time and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be totally fine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re just in the phase where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the transition phase and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s wrong so just give</p>
<p>more time and add the B&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing potassium D the fatigue will lift</p>
<p>happen with it happens with just about</p>
<p>everyone thanks for your question okay</p>
<p>John you&rsquo;re from Toronto you had a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>yes I&rsquo;m starting to look at some dieting</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of your videos</p>
<p>and I was wondering which is better</p>
<p>is it better to do full fasting or</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and also can you to</p>
<p>maintain your exercise program is okay</p>
<p>to keep going to the gym</p>
<p>throughout either of those good question</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m just gonna give you some</p>
<p>general answers on that it really</p>
<p>depends how how much insulin resistance</p>
<p>and blood sugar issue and hypoglycemia</p>
<p>and pre-diabetes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve had let&rsquo;s say you have no</p>
<p>history of blood sugar problems I mean</p>
<p>you can handle full fasting which could</p>
<p>be like fasting for 24 hours and then</p>
<p>maybe eating for a day back and forth I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s probably unnecessary I</p>
<p>think I like in a minute fasting because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s consistent it&rsquo;s easier to do it</p>
<p>takes less discipline you get to eat</p>
<p>everyday a lot of my clients do one meal</p>
<p>a day which is surprising and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some powerful burnt fat burning I do two</p>
<p>meals a day but I would do I would work</p>
<p>up to one or two meals a day that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would recommend but the difference</p>
<p>between fasting for a longer period of</p>
<p>time and then eating and then fasting</p>
<p>for a longer period of time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the results are fairly similar</p>
<p>to intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say one is better than the</p>
<p>other because both of them will will</p>
<p>stimulate a toffee G which is the</p>
<p>clearing out of all the solar debris and</p>
<p>the anti-aging and cleaning up</p>
<p>pathogenic bacteria in your cells so I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to get benefit on</p>
<p>both so I would pick the one that that</p>
<p>you like and Orsi Deacon spearmint but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen more results with one</p>
<p>versus the other make sure you get your</p>
<p>nutrients so that&rsquo;s the key so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing fasting you have to eat bigger</p>
<p>meals thanks John hey Judy you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>New York go ahead you had a question</p>
<p>hi thank you for taking my call I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been with you for a long time dr. Burke</p>
<p>and I just love you I took the quiz and</p>
<p>I ordered the adrenal crit I also my</p>
<p>question is I was wondering if I could</p>
<p>take all of the other supplements that I</p>
<p>am taking</p>
<p>now when I get this kit and started I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking d3 with k2 I take stone Roo</p>
<p>magnesium being vitamin B and C and I do</p>
<p>have your wheatgrass and I love it and I</p>
<p>just wonder can i still keep taking</p>
<p>everything else with the kit</p>
<p>sure absolutely the only question I have</p>
<p>is like your vitamin C how many</p>
<p>milligrams is it uh I don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>right on me um but tell me what I should</p>
<p>be taking that&rsquo;s all of it so they just</p>
<p>just make sure the vitamin C a lot of</p>
<p>times people get vitamin C in a</p>
<p>synthetic they don&rsquo;t know it so</p>
<p>especially if it has high milligram</p>
<p>dosage like over 500 we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>synthetic so look in the label make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the food base make sure it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just all scorebook acid that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>number two if you&rsquo;re taking calcium make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s not calcium carbonate now I do</p>
<p>use in my digestive formula I&rsquo;d use a</p>
<p>little calcium carbonate just as a</p>
<p>binder but it&rsquo;s like 0.01 milligrams</p>
<p>compared to 500 milligrams so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to be a problem but the point</p>
<p>is when you take 500 milligrams of</p>
<p>calcium carbonate that idea I like</p>
<p>calcium citrate calcium lactate and then</p>
<p>you want to always take your calcium an</p>
<p>empty stomach right before bed but in</p>
<p>general know you could you could mix it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be any problem at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>thanks Judy Patricia you had a question</p>
<p>from Pennsylvania go ahead probably five</p>
<p>years I would say and now he got a dizzy</p>
<p>spell he&rsquo;ll wake up me he&rsquo;s been missing</p>
<p>a lot of school and one time just</p>
<p>recently he fell asleep on the couch and</p>
<p>he woke up peed and he said he had no</p>
<p>sense that he had to get it a bathroom</p>
<p>yeah does he do a lot of carbs yeah you</p>
<p>know the whole blot the bladder thing</p>
<p>kids they you know wet their bed that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all blood sugar issues mostly</p>
<p>is to think about a diabetic they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>urinating frequently okay why is that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s higher sugar in the</p>
<p>blood and has it comes out wherever the</p>
<p>sugar goes the water goes so if he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>teenager it&rsquo;s gonna be really tough but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to somehow get him on</p>
<p>a better eating plan maybe start making</p>
<p>some of these keto bombs that we have</p>
<p>recipes my wife and I do to give him</p>
<p>some alternatives so then he won&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>less sugar and then you need to just</p>
<p>kind of get it out of the house and</p>
<p>replace it with some sugar-free type</p>
<p>things okay and then try to get him to</p>
<p>eat something green it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>besides pistachio ice cream and lime</p>
<p>green jello like actual vegetable and so</p>
<p>he could start eating that and get</p>
<p>healthy that&rsquo;s really gonna solve his</p>
<p>problem because nausea is kind of like a</p>
<p>gallbladder liver issue Hey been there</p>
<p>done that I have the t-shirt at that age</p>
<p>I was doing the same thing I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how I survived but I would try to get to</p>
<p>him okay hey you guys I want to thank</p>
<p>you guys for being here listening to me</p>
<p>oh I appreciate all your great questions</p>
