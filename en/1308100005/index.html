No, but I&amp;rsquo;m about to gag over my own breath right now because it&amp;rsquo;s so terrible.
What did you eat?
Caesar salad and it&amp;rsquo;s bad, so don&amp;rsquo;t try to French kiss me.
You will not be happy.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting you bring up French kissing because we&amp;rsquo;re going to get into this
episode, fetishes.
I cannot wait, like I&amp;rsquo;m salivating at the thought, I&amp;rsquo;m so excited.'>

    <p>Pops, anything interesting happen to you this week?</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m about to gag over my own breath right now because it&rsquo;s so terrible.</p>
<p>What did you eat?</p>
<p>Caesar salad and it&rsquo;s bad, so don&rsquo;t try to French kiss me.</p>
<p>You will not be happy.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting you bring up French kissing because we&rsquo;re going to get into this</p>
<p>episode, fetishes.</p>
<p>I cannot wait, like I&rsquo;m salivating at the thought, I&rsquo;m so excited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Pamps.</p>
<p>This is a new episode of I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s starring Pamps with a bad breath.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You remember in that Beyonce song, Becky with the good hair?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Pamps with a bad breath.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When we first decided like a year and a half ago to do this podcast, I found this article</p>
<p>and I thought, I&rsquo;m going to save that, I&rsquo;m going to read it to Pamps for the very first</p>
<p>time on the podcast because it is right in your wheelhouse.</p>
<p>The title of it is Breast Milk is Not for Men.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m just going to read the highlighted areas that I found interesting.</p>
<p>Global demand for human breast milk has never been greater.</p>
<p>Breast milk banks and peer-to-peer sharing have long existed for mothers in need, but</p>
<p>now it is increasingly being sold for profit.</p>
<p>And not just to parents wishing to feed their babies.</p>
<p>There is a dark side to this trade, as there always is when human body parts and products</p>
<p>are brokered.</p>
<p>Lactation and pregnancy pornography is an upsettingly fast-growing genre.</p>
<p>Aside from hearing the stories of two couples that practice, quote, erotic feeding while</p>
<p>live streaming on porn sites, viewers were also introduced to a young woman that goes</p>
<p>by Milky Mummy, a mother of three infants who made ¬£30,000 selling lactating videos</p>
<p>online.</p>
<p>In an attempt to understand why an adult man would buy such services, I spoke to someone</p>
<p>who hides behind the pseudonym Breast Milk Enjoyer.</p>
<p>He told me he was introduced to the concept by the online bodybuilding community who drink</p>
<p>breast milk for the human growth hormone IGF-1 and because it is rich in probiotics.</p>
<p>A friend gave me a bag of his wife&rsquo;s frozen milk to try, to see if I liked it before making</p>
<p>it a staple, he told me.</p>
<p>It was much sweeter than I expected.</p>
<p>Breast Milk Enjoyer also tells me that, quote, online right-wing bodybuilding community,</p>
<p>which I am a part of, sources almost entirely from wives of men in the sphere or women who</p>
<p>are adjacent to it.</p>
<p>I very much enjoy it now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fetish thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just had so much of it over the years that any taboo is broken.</p>
<p>Once you go frozen, you must try it fresh off the tap.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Direct quote.</p>
<p>He says, you have no idea the state of our inboxes.</p>
<p>Women will advertise a full-service milking experience complete with costumes for thousands</p>
<p>of dollars.</p>
<p>So a couple of things are happening here, more than a couple.</p>
<p>Number one, you got the bodybuilders that want some sort of pure milk.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just take steroids like a normal bodybuilder?</p>
<p>Hey, Jennifer.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question real quick before you, I guess, bash the breast milk?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fetish of mine, but just last week, me and my wife had a conversation because</p>
<p>we were watching our youngest brand new nephew, and her sister brought over breast milk packages.</p>
<p>My wife knows I don&rsquo;t outsource breast milk, but while she&rsquo;s pregnant, it&rsquo;s not like a</p>
<p>fight for who gets the titty milk.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re not watching-</p>
<p>Compete with your children?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part of the problem?</p>
<p>Richard.</p>
<p>But it tastes good.</p>
<p>Richard.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>This is alarming.</p>
<p>I feel like we could have gone all our lives without knowing that.</p>
<p>But I feel like on this show, you guys needed to know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a sound engineer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You guys needed to just deep dive into these fucked up men that drink titty milk, and Richard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a titty baby.</p>
<p>Again, part of the problem.</p>
<p>My wife was like, you bet not drink none of my sister&rsquo;s breast milk in there.</p>
<p>Did you do it?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You cannot.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s &hellip; I&rsquo;m not saying I think it&rsquo;s normal for your own wife&rsquo;s breast milk, but</p>
<p>her sister&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s disturbing.</p>
<p>I just-</p>
<p>It started out on accident.</p>
<p>You know you got to test the baby&rsquo;s milk because you don&rsquo;t want to make it too hot before you</p>
<p>give it to the baby?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Typically, you just kind of dab it on your arm, though.</p>
<p>I was like, well, let me just &hellip; Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Again, Richard, part of the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Part of the problem.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even really process that right now.</p>
<p>I want to get to the people I don&rsquo;t know that do this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable talking about them than the person who is-</p>
<p>On the other side of the glass.</p>
<p>Right fucking there.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real life titty baby.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the bodybuilders that are doing this for their own &hellip; Like you said, why are they</p>
<p>not fucking taking steroids like a normal bodybuilder?</p>
<p>Like a normal bodybuilder.</p>
<p>And number two, then you have these fetishes, lactating orgies and shit.</p>
<p>Like doing it online, like you rent somebody to come over with the breast milk in a costume?</p>
<p>Because there has been such an increasing demand, obviously poor women are selling their</p>
<p>milk and they&rsquo;re getting further marginalized.</p>
<p>Like these women in Cambodia, there&rsquo;s literally like these milk farms that they&rsquo;re hooked</p>
<p>up to to satisfy the Richards of the world so they can drink this goddamn milk.</p>
<p>Then there is a human exploitation side of this, too.</p>
<p>As always.</p>
<p>For these freaks.</p>
<p>I just, I want to poll the producers.</p>
<p>Richard, I already know what your fucking problem is.</p>
<p>Neil, but let me ask Pumps first.</p>
<p>Pumps, do you have any fetishes?</p>
<p>I was thinking about that.</p>
<p>I think my tea, having to have my tea all the time, is that a fetish or just an eccentricity?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a kinky motherfucker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about as much as it would get.</p>
<p>Your iced tea.</p>
<p>My iced tea.</p>
<p>Is your fetish.</p>
<p>Because I have to have it all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>You always make fun of me for carrying that gold thing around.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason that you&rsquo;re not getting laid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey baby, what&rsquo;s your fetish?</p>
<p>I love that iced tea.</p>
<p>What are yours?</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a fetish, but I have just an abnormal attraction to these</p>
<p>tennis players.</p>
<p>Right, who are gorgeous.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not like.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And like super alpha male.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you want to do any of these.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have like a, while I&rsquo;m in the sack, I have this.</p>
<p>Like it turns me on if you suck my toes or something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that either.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty normal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Except for Richard.</p>
<p>Nellie, do you have a fetish?</p>
<p>I do like DJs.</p>
<p>Female DJs.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a DJ.</p>
<p>You like a DJ.</p>
<p>I like spinning it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jen.</p>
<p>Everybody has a crush on a DJ at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask Jen.</p>
<p>Jen, do you have any fetishes?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, can you tell us?</p>
<p>Will you tell us?</p>
<p>Feet!</p>
<p>Her feet.</p>
<p>I would think that would be a hard fetish to have because people&rsquo;s feet like get sweaty</p>
<p>and they stink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mime.</p>
<p>The nails.</p>
<p>Mime don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hers actually smell really great.</p>
<p>I guess I just need to get a turntable and some headphones.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>Maybe you could get down on the feet.</p>
<p>So I have a funny fetish story.</p>
<p>So this gay friend of mine, he used to live in Oklahoma City and now he lives in Detroit.</p>
<p>He was on like Grindr and all this shit, right?</p>
<p>So he tells me there&rsquo;s this guy he matches with.</p>
<p>They do a dick pic exchange.</p>
<p>And so I say to my friend, I&rsquo;m like, so what happened?</p>
<p>He goes, so I go over to this guy&rsquo;s house, answers the door, totally exactly what&rsquo;s delivered.</p>
<p>The body, everything, there was no bait and switch.</p>
<p>The guy escorts him to this dresser in the bedroom.</p>
<p>He opens up the dresser and it&rsquo;s like serial killer style organization, folded socks, real</p>
<p>psychotic, like totally perfect, like at a retailer.</p>
<p>And so he says, pick out your pair of socks and put them on your feet.</p>
<p>The guy instructs him to turn over so that his feet, the arch of the feet are kind of</p>
<p>like together.</p>
<p>The guy like got so turned on about these socks.</p>
<p>That was his deal.</p>
<p>I mean, if that&rsquo;s not like totally like that&rsquo;s mommy issues or daddy issues with the dirty</p>
<p>socks.</p>
<p>I mean, just total Freudian bait, like analyze forever.</p>
<p>But that was, that was the jam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;ll say like this.</p>
<p>I think he sounds like a great guy.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of good qualities to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s neat.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s organized.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s remarkable about the 10 minutes we&rsquo;ve been in this episode so far.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We never are the normal people, you and me ever, ever, ever, ever now.</p>
<p>And we are, we&rsquo;re not into DJ sex.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not into titty milk to socks and feet and toes and all that shit.</p>
<p>I mean, but there&rsquo;s no funky, freaky, weird fetish like these producers that are doing</p>
<p>this podcast of ours.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I like that you pointed that out because never, ever would we be average, normal people.</p>
<p>Well, I have a treat for you, my dear.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>We have a guest.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>He is a former MMA fighter, bare knuckle fighter.</p>
<p>I think like that means you don&rsquo;t have a glove on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Turned drag queen.</p>
<p>I love that already.</p>
<p>From fighter to drag queen and apparently has major fetishes.</p>
<p>His name is Diego Gargiel.</p>
<p>Very well done.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Very well done.</p>
<p>Check out his name.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Mr. Butthole.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Diego.</p>
<p>Mr. Butthole.</p>
<p>Hi Diego.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s French.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pronounced Mr. Buthole.</p>
<p>Buthole.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Diego, I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>This is Pump.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fucking crazy shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll love her.</p>
<p>Ben and Nellie tell us that you used to be a bare knuckle fighter, a former MMA fighter,</p>
<p>and then you turned into a drag queen, which I love, love, love that transition.</p>
<p>How did that come about?</p>
<p>I was taking some emotional intelligence courses.</p>
<p>I was trying to transition from being a full-time fighter to being a full-time artist.</p>
<p>And it was just something that they were, during the course, they&rsquo;re like, what could</p>
<p>you do that&rsquo;s outside of your comfort zone that you&rsquo;ve never done before?</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that popped into my head.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What if I did a drag show?</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, oh shit, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Everybody at that class had met me straight from a match where I had broken my hand.</p>
<p>I had metal rods coming out of my hand.</p>
<p>I had stitches all over my face.</p>
<p>So these people, they met me, their first impression&rsquo;s like, oh shit, this guy&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>really tough fucking gnarly macho dude.</p>
<p>So during the class, mostly, not mostly, but a lot of emotional intelligence courses, I</p>
<p>think a heavy subject has to do with vulnerability, which is very hard for especially toxic males</p>
<p>and shit.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a huge problem with them.</p>
<p>And since I was like, oh, what if I do a drag show, everybody&rsquo;s like, oh shit, that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get the mission more than that to be like, hey, I&rsquo;m going to do something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vulnerable for me to do.</p>
<p>Do you have the name and number of your emotional intelligence teacher or the course information</p>
<p>so I can sign pumps up for that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be really helpful for you.</p>
<p>She told me a couple of days ago I was the least emotional person on the planet.</p>
<p>Oh, jeez.</p>
<p>Borderline sociopath.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your drag name?</p>
<p>Yeah, dying to know that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your drag name?</p>
<p>Lola Pistola, which is a play on my fighting name, which is Diego Dos Pistolas.</p>
<p>Yariho was how I would be billed when I was fighting.</p>
<p>So I thought it was real cute.</p>
<p>Did you know you could dance and stuff?</p>
<p>You have to have pretty good moves to be a drag queen, but I guess you have to be pretty</p>
<p>good moves to be a fighter too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Footwork helps a lot.</p>
<p>I know some really high level fighters that are actually really good dancers and it does</p>
<p>have a lot to do with rhythm and footwork.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it necessarily carries over, but I think ever since I was a small child,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed dancing and probably enjoyed it more on the feminine side than other kids.</p>
<p>I was raised by a single mom and there was a lot of gay folks around our home when I</p>
<p>was growing up.</p>
<p>For me, it was very acceptable to express my feminine side.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a dad in the house that was like, because I&rsquo;m Latin, I come from Mexico,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a Latin culture.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have that in the home where somebody was saying like, oh, if you do that, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to turn gay, which is very common in a Mexican or Latin American household.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get into fighting?</p>
<p>I think I always liked action movies as a child and I loved Bruce Lee and I just loved</p>
<p>that whole thing.</p>
<p>Then I went to see a documentary at my brother&rsquo;s house and it just opened up my eyes.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a little bit lost.</p>
<p>I was just barely getting out of a life of crime and I needed something with a lot of</p>
<p>passion in my life and I saw that documentary.</p>
<p>Even though it didn&rsquo;t depict a good lifestyle for MMA, I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s what I want</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Then I saw it on a Friday, signed up to a gym on a Monday.</p>
<p>The next Monday, I was dropping out of college probably to be trained full time within less</p>
<p>than a year.</p>
<p>I like this kind of impulsivity that you have, like, I&rsquo;m going to be a fighter and you just</p>
<p>start.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at emotional intelligence class and it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to be a drag queen and</p>
<p>you just do it.</p>
<p>I mean, see, Pumps, there&rsquo;s hope for you.</p>
<p>There is hope for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be a very good drag queen though because I&rsquo;m not coordinated.</p>
<p>I never get the footwork.</p>
<p>Also you&rsquo;re already a woman.</p>
<p>Oh, that does suck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I do have drag kings though.</p>
<p>Drag kings?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can be a drag king.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about before you joined us are fetishes, okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pumps, neither one of us has any fetishes.</p>
<p>The producers, I&rsquo;m not going to even get into the kinky shit that these people do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s un-fucking-believable and I&rsquo;m not going to bore our audience with the filth again.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about, I heard that you may have some fetishes.</p>
<p>What are they first and foremost?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;m super open-minded.</p>
<p>I like to try new things all the time.</p>
<p>I think that keeps things fresh.</p>
<p>I go through cycles and then right now it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m really into my girlfriend&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>I love smelling her feet and kissing her feet.</p>
<p>Do you have a rule about you have to shower immediately preceding any kind of footsie</p>
<p>games?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I think sex should be dirty and you should shower after sex, not before sex, especially</p>
<p>the way I do it, for sure.</p>
<p>What if your girlfriend&rsquo;s had her shoes on all day without socks?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re attracted to somebody, you&rsquo;re probably attracted to their pheromones.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>You can smell your partner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t want to smell like a bunch of deodorant and perfumes.</p>
<p>Pumps here, she got divorced how long ago?</p>
<p>So she went through like a decade-long dry spell, possibly more.</p>
<p>And then recently went on a date, had sex again, and then now we&rsquo;re back to totally</p>
<p>being asexual again.</p>
<p>And Pumps, do you want to have sex with anybody?</p>
<p>If I liked him.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>You would?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like smelling my partner.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I like, you know, smelling their armpits and stuff.</p>
<p>Like I said, lately I&rsquo;ve been into the foot thing, but man, it&rsquo;s like, when I think about</p>
<p>it, it&rsquo;s like, what fetish haven&rsquo;t I had?</p>
<p>You know, like I&rsquo;ve tried everything with my partner, you know, and explored all kinds</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>And you know, lately we&rsquo;ve been discussing maybe bringing in a person just to watch us</p>
<p>have sex.</p>
<p>You know, like not participate, you know, that&rsquo;s something that we have.</p>
<p>A voyeur?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you both really fit?</p>
<p>Obviously you&rsquo;re pretty fit.</p>
<p>Is she pretty fit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I love my girlfriend&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>You know, she&rsquo;s not as athletic as I am for sure.</p>
<p>Like I, you know, like working out is like almost not even a part of my routine, but</p>
<p>a part of my job.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>I want to get back to the voyeur.</p>
<p>Do you interview the voyeur?</p>
<p>Do you take applications?</p>
<p>How do you find the voyeur for you all to be the exhibitionist with?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve just barely been discussing.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not something that we like, it&rsquo;s not developed, just jump, you know, a hundred</p>
<p>percent.</p>
<p>Like you always have to be mindful of your partners, you know, their pace, cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>I want to know how do you find the voyeur?</p>
<p>Like if she can sense and she&rsquo;s like, yeah, I want the voyeur.</p>
<p>Is there a specific type of voyeur?</p>
<p>Is it any voyeur?</p>
<p>Well, for, like I said, for sure, we&rsquo;re just like barely starting to discuss this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just at the beginning of the discussion.</p>
<p>So I would imagine that, yeah, you&rsquo;re going to like discuss what they&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>What kind of person do you want to bring in?</p>
<p>You know, I wouldn&rsquo;t like pull a stranger off the street, you know, like that seems</p>
<p>like a little bit risky cause you&rsquo;re still, I mean, I feel very confident to take care</p>
<p>of myself and my partner is still involved in the equation.</p>
<p>So at the same time, it&rsquo;s like, to me, that&rsquo;s not something that sounds super attractive</p>
<p>to have a person that we see on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t like ask somebody, you know, it would have to be a situation where you</p>
<p>meet somebody, maybe the vibe is right and you, you know, you&rsquo;re probably not going to</p>
<p>be seeing this person on a regular basis and say, Hey, you know, would you be interested</p>
<p>in watching us have sex?</p>
<p>And then you have to discuss limitations cause you&rsquo;d have to be like, well, look, this is</p>
<p>just a show you&rsquo;re not allowed to touch.</p>
<p>What about, have you ever had a threesome?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have had a threesome.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So is it girl, girl, boy, you&rsquo;re the boy or is it two boys and a girl or both?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had both.</p>
<p>Would you be a voyeur?</p>
<p>Like an in-person voyeur, like in the room?</p>
<p>In-person voyeur?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would you be a webcam voyeur?</p>
<p>And I think you could be sexually frustrated.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t your mother clean out your closet recently and threw away your vibrator?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been replaced.</p>
<p>Those things are expensive, man.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>They are expensive.</p>
<p>She bought a goop vibrator and her mom comes over and does this manic organizing of her</p>
<p>closet and the vibrator gets by by.</p>
<p>No moss.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so thrilled for everyone to hear that.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So what about like, okay, I&rsquo;ve always wondered like people like butt balls, like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>advantage of a butt ball?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say like an advantage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something you either like it or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you like it?</p>
<p>Do you like a butt ball?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I do like to do butt stuff on my partner.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s always very fair that like if they want to do something on me, I let</p>
<p>them do it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Diego, you&rsquo;re the sweetest.</p>
<p>Where was he when we were procreating?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want to do something with your butt.</p>
<p>But you can also mess with my butt.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That brings me to another question.</p>
<p>Turnabout butt play.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do people, is it like routine for people to lick each other&rsquo;s assholes?</p>
<p>Because people will say, I hate her ass.</p>
<p>I mean, apparently with the young kids, it is now like I, like, you know, I&rsquo;m still 43.</p>
<p>You know, my partner&rsquo;s 33, so she&rsquo;s younger.</p>
<p>But all I hear is like, kids are always joking about eating ass and shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, man, this next generation is like, that&rsquo;s the kiss on the lips of, I mean, everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just getting queer and more loosey goosey with their morals.</p>
<p>Again, even with a good fresh shower, I think I&rsquo;d be out.</p>
<p>But Diego prefers no shower.</p>
<p>So would you lick an ass with no shower, Diego?</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>And I have.</p>
<p>All I can say is I think I have a real strong immune system.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t catch COVID or at least I&rsquo;ve, man, I&rsquo;ve been trying, like, dude, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Five days off.</p>
<p>Has somebody ever licked your ass?</p>
<p>And if so, does it feel good?</p>
<p>Is there some turn on to it?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And everybody has different erogenous zones, you know?</p>
<p>But for sure, there&rsquo;s like nerve endings there that make things feel good or people wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be into ass play all the time.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve also like done tattoos for a living at different stages in my life.</p>
<p>And people say like different areas hurt on them, you know, and it&rsquo;s because some people</p>
<p>say, oh, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>You know, my ribs didn&rsquo;t hurt, but my knees hurt a lot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the same thing with erogenous zones?</p>
<p>You just have more nerves somewhere than other people.</p>
<p>And if somebody has more nerves in their butthole than other people, then they&rsquo;re probably gonna</p>
<p>like butt play more than a regular person.</p>
<p>You know, what I like is now, Angie, you have a new word in your arsenal, butt play.</p>
<p>Butt play.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A little butt play.</p>
<p>I like butt stuff too.</p>
<p>You like to do butt stuff?</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re talking to somebody, like, you know, like getting to know somebody</p>
<p>on the dating apps or something, you might want to be like, hey, I&rsquo;m just curious, are</p>
<p>you into the butt stuff?</p>
<p>You into the butt stuff?</p>
<p>Into the butt stuff.</p>
<p>If you had to pick your voyeur right now, would it be a male or a female?</p>
<p>For me, the biggest turnout would be a female.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Does the female, does she get to comment?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to me, but if they were like-</p>
<p>These are questions that need to be asked before you start interviewing voyeurs.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re here to help just for the sheer fascination of it.</p>
<p>I see that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>You bring it up.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just good old girls from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>This is a whole new world for us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I never actually thought about that, but that&rsquo;s something I could discuss with my partner.</p>
<p>What if y&rsquo;all come up to all agreements and then the voyeur goes off script?</p>
<p>It could be like a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode.</p>
<p>I think at some point I want to follow up with you after you do it.</p>
<p>Sheer curiosity.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing I never considered.</p>
<p>What if they go super off script?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be careful about this voyeur.</p>
<p>They could really come in and try to throw a grenade in the whole thing.</p>
<p>So Diego, if you were to give Pump some advice, I think she needs to get back out there in</p>
<p>the dating world.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>If you were to give her some advice, what advice would you give this fabulous woman</p>
<p>here to just get back out there, get into it, but play the whole nine?</p>
<p>First of all, I would say go out there if you want to do it for yourself.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to if you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing also that it&rsquo;s like when people are looking to be happy in a relationship,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not happy by themselves, they&rsquo;re not going to be happy in a relationship.</p>
<p>You have to be happy with yourself first before you start dating people.</p>
<p>So sometimes if you&rsquo;re in a place in life where you&rsquo;re happy by yourself and everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going along and then sometimes you meet the right person when you weren&rsquo;t even looking</p>
<p>for them, I find that works most of the time rather than people that are out constantly</p>
<p>looking for the right person in the wrong place.</p>
<p>What about a dating app?</p>
<p>What about a dating app for Pumps?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been like real world.</p>
<p>Have you guys ever heard the joke that everything&rsquo;s a dating app if you&rsquo;re creepy enough?</p>
<p>No, but I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s like I do remember one time I started dating somebody that I had met from</p>
<p>Instagram and I don&rsquo;t want to say I went on to regret it because it was a huge learning</p>
<p>experience in my life, but I definitely in the future going prefer to not meet somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s long distance and then try to make it work because I think that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>bucket of worms.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;ve got to understand about Pumps is if the person lives in a different</p>
<p>state, that is an asset for her, not a deficit because then she would only have to see them</p>
<p>once a month, once every two months because that&rsquo;s about how much you could tolerate,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be about right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a long distance dater, except.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean that&rsquo;s the thing about the apps too though.</p>
<p>If you like put in what you&rsquo;re looking for and you can find somebody, you find an app</p>
<p>that has the right algorithm or the right search function, that&rsquo;s going to help you</p>
<p>find somebody that&rsquo;s looking for the same things you&rsquo;re looking for, then yeah, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably a benefit, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I think the dating maps might come in handy if people have real specific</p>
<p>things of what they&rsquo;re looking for, you know?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, I forgot what they&rsquo;re called, but I think they might be called feeders,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people that like have a fetish for feeding overweight people and just like</p>
<p>they constantly like to feed them and help them get fatter.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Start over.</p>
<p>I know that fetish exists.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re feeders, they feed people to make them fatter?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is like if you have an app, it&rsquo;s probably easier to find an app with the</p>
<p>right search function that&rsquo;s going to help you find that than if you just walk around</p>
<p>to overweight people and be like, hey, can I feed you?</p>
<p>And you see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re going for something very specific, you might be better off on the app.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, maybe you could put like, I&rsquo;m into butt play, I&rsquo;m into butt play in a long</p>
<p>distance relationship.</p>
<p>Call me Pumps.</p>
<p>For a good time, call Pumps.</p>
<p>For a good time, call Pumps.</p>
<p>I could put butt play and strap on, come with strap on.</p>
<p>Oh, you would strap it on.</p>
<p>You would be, you would butt play on him.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You reverse it.</p>
<p>You flip the script.</p>
<p>I wear the strap on.</p>
<p>Flip that shit.</p>
<p>Flip that shit, Larry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you want to be a dom?</p>
<p>Like, have you ever explored that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I have, I find that so interesting, but no, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to do it as a job or anything, but it&rsquo;s like, just by what you</p>
<p>said and maybe it&rsquo;s like, you know, maybe you want to like try to hook up with a submissive</p>
<p>man that where you&rsquo;re the one in charge in the bedroom, you know?</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s her profile.</p>
<p>I think you could help us with this.</p>
<p>Pumps, dominant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into reverse butt play.</p>
<p>Flip that script, butt play, and you can have a little whip.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I can have a little whip.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I could do that.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I could do that.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Diego, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Diego, will you tell us, I heard from Jen that you are an amazing artist.</p>
<p>Will you tell us about your art?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She is correct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a artist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, I enjoy painting and it&rsquo;s very funny because just recently I made a sculpture that some</p>
<p>people might call assemblage art because you&rsquo;re assembling things together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually like sculpting clay, but a lot of people still call it sculpture.</p>
<p>And I really enjoyed that very much.</p>
<p>And I was speaking to our dealer in New York who would be interested in promoting that.</p>
<p>And so in the near future, I think at least for a while, I&rsquo;m going to be switching from</p>
<p>painting to this form of sculpting or assemblage art as some people call it.</p>
<p>So some of the pieces are pretty big and it&rsquo;s not really what you like, just pick up,</p>
<p>you know, like going through Etsy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, really gallery pieces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coffee table item.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like gallery pieces for like serious collectors and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So my Instagram is just Diego Garijo, the way my name is spelled.</p>
<p>Not Mr. Butthole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my, like I said, Mr. Buthole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a family name that we use for Zizooms.</p>
<p>The way to reach me or look at my art is through my Instagram, Diego Garijo.</p>
<p>One word.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You really are.</p>
<p>And then the fighting one, the contrast, I like that, but it&rsquo;s in Spanish or is it French?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Mexican.</p>
<p>He already told us that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But then he said it was French.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s just my Zoom name.</p>
<p>My Zoom name is French for some reason.</p>
<p>But he is ethnically Mexican.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I was born in Mexico.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, mostly, well, actually my 23andMe says otherwise, but I identify as</p>
<p>Mexican.</p>
<p>Spanish is my first language and I was born in Mexico, so I see myself as Mexican.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Well, Diego, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I mean, this is very eye-opening and interesting, and I appreciate how open you are.</p>
<p>I especially appreciate how everything is deferred to your girlfriend, that you&rsquo;re game</p>
<p>for anything, but it goes at her pace and whatever she&rsquo;s comfortable with.</p>
<p>More men like Diego need to be out there.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy sex a lot, and I&rsquo;m really grateful to be with a partner that does as</p>
<p>well because rarely a day goes by that we don&rsquo;t have sex.</p>
<p>So I think for guys listening out there, that if you&rsquo;re having problems with your partner,</p>
<p>not guys, anybody that&rsquo;s having a hard time with their partner, it&rsquo;s like maybe just try</p>
<p>listening more what they want.</p>
<p>And then if you can make sure you&rsquo;re fulfilling their needs, I think they&rsquo;ll be more likely</p>
<p>to fulfill your needs.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tip.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Diego.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diego.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me on.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll always have a link in my bio where you can click and see any paintings for sale.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>I just tore my biceps, so I would love to sell some.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Bye, Diego.</p>
<p>Bye, Diego.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like everything you would want in a partner.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I just love how open he is that you can just&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the questions that I know you were asking about, he&rsquo;s sniffing toes, sniffing asses.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing all of it.</p>
<p>And you could just ask him a question.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t act offended.</p>
<p>And he just answered these questions that we needed answers to.</p>
<p>The only thing that I don&rsquo;t think I could do would be sex every day, every single day.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I mean, the soccer moms in America just about went, ugh, it&rsquo;s a lot of sex.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>You could include this in your future dating app profile.</p>
<p>That will do it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>An ass eater.</p>
<p>I want an ass eater, butt play.</p>
<p>Butt play, but it&rsquo;s the reverse butt play.</p>
<p>Reverse butt play.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re not getting in my ass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting in your ass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting in your ass, motherfucker.</p>
<p>And then you could browbeat him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What is this podcast evolved into?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>We got to end it.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>Horrible people.</p>
<p>This is the lowest hanging fruit.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
