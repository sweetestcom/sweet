    <p>The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most brilliant, productive, and kind people I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of talking to.</p>
<p>A lot of my colleagues at MIT and former MIT faculty and students</p>
<p>wrote to me after our first conversation with some version of,</p>
<p>Manolis is awesome, isn&rsquo;t he? I&rsquo;m glad you guys are now friends. I am too. And I&rsquo;m happy that</p>
<p>he makes time in his insanely busy schedule to sit down and have a chat with me.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the sponsors, Public Goods, Magic Spoon, and ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I just got back from talking to Joe Rogan on his podcast,</p>
<p>my fifth time on there. I also got a chance to record a separate conversation with Joe</p>
<p>on this podcast. We talked on both quite a bit about his journey and his advice for mine.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think made his show special is that he just had fun and made choices</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t get in the way of him having fun and loving life. I&rsquo;m learning to do just that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough since I&rsquo;m naturally full of self doubt and anxiety,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m learning to let go and have fun, even if my monotone robotic voice sometimes sounds otherwise.</p>
<p>For Joe, that involved talking to his friends, comedians, especially ones that brought out the</p>
<p>best in him. Duncan Trussell and the five hour first episode on Spotify comes to mind as an</p>
<p>example of that. Duncan has been a guest probably close to if not more than 50 times on Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>podcast. My hope with amazing people like Manolis is to find my Duncan Trussell, my Joey Diaz,</p>
<p>and yes, even my Eddie Bravo. Obviously Joe and I are very different people but ultimately both</p>
<p>love life when we can interact often with people we love and who inspire us, make us smile,</p>
<p>make us think, and make us have fun when we get behind the mic of a podcast,</p>
<p>whether anyone is listening or not. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,</p>

<p>This show is sponsored by Public Goods, an online store for basic health and household stuff.</p>
<p>Their products have a minimalist black and white design that I find to be just clean,</p>
<p>elegant, and beautiful. It goes nicely, at least I think so, with the design of Crew Dragon and</p>
<p>the recent SpaceX NASA mission that sent two humans into space. To me, very few things are</p>
<p>as inspiring as us humans reaching out into the unknown, the harsh challenges of space.</p>
<p>Colonizing Mars may not have obvious near term benefits, but I believe it will challenge our</p>
<p>scientists and our engineers to create technologies whose impact will be immeasurable for us humans</p>
<p>here on Earth, or those of us who choose to stay here on Earth. Personally, I&rsquo;m kind of a long time</p>
<p>big fan of this planet. Anyway, visit publicgoods.com slash Lex and use code Lex at checkout to get 15</p>

<p>keto friendly cereal. You might have heard on other videos that I eat keto mostly these days,</p>
<p>so Magic Spoon is a delicious healthy treat on a hard workout day that fits into that crazy diet.</p>
<p>Also, they&rsquo;re a sponsor of episode 100 with my dad, and got my dad to buy this cereal and he now</p>
<p>loves it. Honestly, just loves it. It&rsquo;s kind of funny actually. The deep heartfelt nature of that</p>
<p>conversation and the silliness of the cereal captures my dad perfectly. Much of the hardship</p>
<p>in his life he dealt with using wit and humor. His favorite flavor happens to be cocoa. Mine is too.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t bought the eight sleep mattress yet, though my mom wants to, but he&rsquo;s all about this</p>
<p>Magic Spoon cereal. I think it&rsquo;s his actually favorite sponsor of this podcast. Probably</p>
<p>because they chose to sponsor the episode he&rsquo;s on. Anyway, click the magicspoon.com slash Lex</p>

<p>I sent you and also indirectly to make my dad happy. This show is also sponsored by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Get it at expressvpn.com slash Lex pod. They gave me a suggested opening line of using the internet</p>
<p>without ExpressVPN is like going to the bathroom and not closing the door. This is like GPT3</p>
<p>suggesting to me how to be more human like, and I&rsquo;ll honestly take all the help I can get.</p>
<p>By way of life advice, let me tell you that you need a VPN to protect you from Russians like me.</p>
<p>In fact, this podcast is a kind of hack of your biological network where I use my monotone,</p>
<p>low energy voice to convince you to buy kind of expensive cereal as a way to influence the</p>
<p>stability of the US economy. I use ExpressVPN on both Windows and Linux to protect myself</p>

<p>What is beautiful about the human epigenome? Don&rsquo;t get me started. So first of all,</p>
<p>as an engineering feat, the human epigenome manages the most compact, the most incredible</p>
<p>compaction you could imagine. So every single one of your cells contains two meters worth of DNA.</p>
<p>And this is compacted in a radius, which is one thousandth of a millimeter. That&rsquo;s six orders of</p>
<p>magnitude. To give you a sense of scale, it&rsquo;s as if a string as tall as the Burj Al Khalifa,</p>
<p>which is about a kilometer tall, was compacted into a tiny little ball the size of a millimeter.</p>
<p>And if you put it all together, if you stretch the trillions of cells that we have, we have about</p>
<p>30 trillion cells in your body. If you stretch the DNA, the two meters worth of DNA in every one of</p>
<p>your trillion cells, you would basically reach all the way to Jupiter a hundred times.</p>
<p>A hundred times. Yeah, it&rsquo;s all curled up in there. It&rsquo;s 30 trillion cells.</p>
<p>30 trillion cells, every one of them two meters worth of DNA. So all of that is compacted through</p>
<p>the epigenome. The epigenome basically has the ability to compact this massive amount of DNA</p>
<p>from here to Jupiter 10 times into one human body, into just the nuclei of one human body,</p>
<p>and the vast majority of the human body is not even these nuclei.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the structural part. So that&rsquo;s the boring part. That&rsquo;s the structural part.</p>
<p>The functional part is way more interesting. So functionally, what the human epigenome allows</p>
<p>you to do is basically control the activity patterns of thousands of genes. So 20,000 genes</p>
<p>in your human body, every one of your cells only needs a few thousand of those, but a different</p>
<p>few thousand of those. And the way that your cells remember what their identity is, is basically</p>
<p>driven by the epigenome. So the epigenome is both structural in sort of making this dramatic</p>
<p>compaction, and it&rsquo;s also functional in being able to actually control the activity patterns</p>
<p>of all your cells. Now, can we draw a definition distinction between the genome and the epigenome?</p>
<p>Again, being Greek, epi means on top of. So the genome is the DNA, and the epigenome is anything</p>
<p>on top of the DNA. And there&rsquo;s three types of things on top of the DNA. The first is chemical</p>
<p>modifications on the DNA itself. So we like to think of four bases of the DNA, A, C, G, T. C</p>
<p>has a methyl form, which is sometimes referred to as the fifth base. So methyl C takes a different</p>
<p>meaning. So in the same way that you have annotations in a orchestra score that basically</p>
<p>say whether you should play something softly or loudly or space it out or interpret basically</p>
<p>the score, the human epigenome allows you to modify that primary score. So a modified C</p>
<p>basically says, play this one softly. It&rsquo;s basically a sign of repression in a gene</p>
<p>regulatory region. I love how you&rsquo;re talking about the function that emerges from the epigenome as a</p>
<p>musical score. It is in many ways. And every single cell plays a different part of that score.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having all of human knowledge in 23 volumes, like 23 giant books, which are your</p>
<p>chromosomes. And every single cell has a different profession, a different role. Some cells play the</p>
<p>piano and they&rsquo;re looking at chapter seven from chromosome 23 and chapter four from chromosome</p>
<p>two and so on and so forth. And each of those pieces are all encoded in the same DNA. But</p>
<p>what the epigenome allows you to do is effectively conduct the orchestra and sort of coordinate the</p>
<p>pieces so that every instrument plays only the things that it needs to play. One thing that kind</p>
<p>of blows my mind, maybe you can tell me your thoughts about it, is the way evolution works</p>
<p>with natural selection is based on the final sort of the entirety of the orchestra musical</p>
<p>performance, right? But there&rsquo;s these incredibly rich structural things, like each one of them</p>
<p>doing their own little job that somehow work together. The evolution selects based on the</p>
<p>final result and yet all the individual pieces are doing like infinitely minuscule specific things.</p>
<p>How the heck does that work? It&rsquo;s a very good insight. And you can even go beyond that and</p>
<p>basically say evolution doesn&rsquo;t select at the level of an organism. It actually selects at</p>
<p>the level of whole environments, whole ecosystems. So let me break this down. So you basically have</p>
<p>at the very bottom every single nucleotide being selected. But then that nucleotide function is</p>
<p>selected at the level of each gene and every, not even each gene, each gene regulatory control</p>
<p>element. And then those control elements are basically converging onto the function of the gene</p>
<p>and many genes are converging onto the function of one cell and many cells are converging into</p>
<p>the function of one tissue or organ. And all of these organs are converging onto the level of</p>
<p>an organism. But now that organism is not in isolation. So if you basically think about why</p>
<p>is altruism, for example, a thing, why are people being nice to each other? It was probably selected</p>
<p>and it was probably selected because those species that were just nasty to each other didn&rsquo;t survive</p>
<p>as a species. And now if you think about symbiosis of, you know, there&rsquo;s plants, for example, that</p>
<p>love CO2 and there&rsquo;s humans that love O2 and we&rsquo;re sort of, you know, trading different types of gases</p>
<p>to each other. If you look at ecosystems where one organism was just really nasty, that organism</p>
<p>actually died because everyone they were being nasty to was killed off. And then that kind of,</p>
<p>you know, universe of life is gone. So basically what emerges is selection at so many different</p>
<p>layers of benefit, including, you know, all of these nucleotides within a body interacting for</p>
<p>the emergent functions at the body level. Yeah. I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to break it down into</p>
<p>levels that&rsquo;s selection even beyond humans. Like you said, environment, but there&rsquo;s environments</p>
<p>at all different levels too, right? At the minuscule, at the organ level, at the tissue level,</p>
<p>like you said, maybe at the microscopic level. It would be fascinating if like there&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>selection going on, like both the quantum level and like the, the galaxy level. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so yeah, let&rsquo;s again, sort of break down these different layers. So basically if you think about</p>
<p>the environment in which a gene operates, that gene, of course, the first definition of environment</p>
<p>that we think of is pollution or sunlight or heat or cold and so on and so forth. That&rsquo;s the external</p>
<p>environment. But every gene also operates at the level of the internal cellular environment that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in. If I take a gene from say an African individual and I put it in a European context,</p>
<p>will it perform the same way? Probably not because there&rsquo;s a cellular context of thousands of other</p>
<p>genes that that gene has co evolved with, you know, in the out of Africa event and, you know,</p>
<p>all of this sort of human history of evolution. So basically if you look at Neanderthal genes,</p>
<p>for example, which again happened long after that out of Africa event, there&rsquo;s incompatibilities</p>
<p>between Neanderthal genes and modern human genes that can lead to diseases. So in the context of</p>
<p>the Neanderthal genome, that gene version, that allele was fine, but in the context of the modern</p>
<p>human genome, that Neanderthal gene version is actually detrimental. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>that cellular environment constitutes the genetics of that gene, but also of course,</p>
<p>all of the epigenomics of that gene. It&rsquo;s fascinating that the gene has a history.</p>
<p>I mean, we talked about this a little bit last time, but just, and then some of your research</p>
<p>goes into that, but the genes as they are today have, have a story from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>And then some, sometimes their story was like their path was useful for survival for the</p>
<p>particular organisms and sometimes not. That&rsquo;s fascinating. Let me ask as a tangent. We kind</p>
<p>of started talking offline about Neanderthals. Do you have something interesting genetically,</p>
<p>biologically in terms of difference between Neanderthal and like the different branches</p>
<p>of human evolution that you find fascinating? Neanderthals are only one of about five branches</p>
<p>that we are pretty confident about. Branches of? Of out of Africa events. So basically there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Neanderthals, there&rsquo;s Denisovans. What is the evidence for Denisovans? One tiny little fragment</p>
<p>of one pinky from one cave in Siberia. Recent, relatively recently discovered, right? Less than</p>
<p>10 years ago. Yeah. And those are like little folks, right? No, no, no, no, no. That&rsquo;s yet</p>
<p>another one though. Homo florensis. It had the little folks instead of Indonesia. But then the</p>
<p>Denisovans are basically another branch that we only know about genetically from that one bone.</p>
<p>And eventually we realized that it&rsquo;s one of the three major branches along with Neanderthal,</p>
<p>modern human and Denisovan. And then that one branch has now resurfaced in many different areas.</p>
<p>And we kind of know about the gene flow that happened in between them. So when I was reading</p>
<p>my Greek mythology, it was talking about the age of the heroes, these eras of human like,</p>
<p>you know, precursors that were wiped out by Zeus or by all kinds of wars and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>like the Titans and the, you know, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to sort of read these stories as a kid because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, whatever. And then you&rsquo;re growing up and you&rsquo;re like, whoa, layers and</p>
<p>layers of human like ancestors. And who knows if those stories were inspired by bones that they</p>
<p>found that kind of looked human like, but were not quite human like. Who knows if stories of dragons</p>
<p>were inspired by bones of dinosaurs. And basically this archeological evidence has been there and has</p>
<p>probably entered the folk imagination, migrated into those stories, but it&rsquo;s not that far removed</p>
<p>from what actually happened of massive wars of wiping out Neanderthals as humans are, modern</p>
<p>humans are populating, you know, Europe. Do you think, do you think what killed the Neanderthals</p>
<p>and all those other branches is human conflict or is it genetic conflict? So is it us humans being</p>
<p>the opposite of altruistic towards each other? Or is it some other competition at some other level,</p>
<p>like as we&rsquo;re discussing? Yeah. So if you look at a lot of human traits today, they&rsquo;re probably not</p>
<p>that far removed from the human traits that got us where we are now. So, you know, this whole</p>
<p>tribalism, you know, you&rsquo;re my sports team or you&rsquo;re my, you know, political party or you&rsquo;re my,</p>
<p>you know, tiny little village. And therefore, you know, if you&rsquo;re from that other village,</p>
<p>I hate you. But as soon as we&rsquo;re both in the major city, I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re from the same region,</p>
<p>my friend, my family and like two neighboring countries fighting. And as soon as they&rsquo;re off</p>
<p>in another country, you&rsquo;re like, oh, I can&rsquo;t believe that. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of funny,</p>
<p>like this tribalism is nonsensical in many ways. It&rsquo;s like cognitive incongruent that basically</p>
<p>we like kin and selection for, for sort of liking kin is hugely advantageous genetically.</p>
<p>Probably across all kinds of organisms, across all kinds of life. Yeah. So, so basically if you</p>
<p>now transport that to the sort of humans arriving in Europe and Neanderthals are everywhere,</p>
<p>what are you going to do? You&rsquo;re going to kill them off. You know, there&rsquo;s this battle for territory</p>
<p>and this battle for, they&rsquo;re not like us. We have to get rid of them. So basically there&rsquo;s a, you</p>
<p>know, very interesting mix there, but, and yet, and yet when you look at the genetics, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tons of gene flow between them. So basically, you know, love romance between, you know, tribes,</p>
<p>but love spans the gap between the different tribes. It&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet across species</p>
<p>boundaries. Sneaks away from the village. Even before the out of Africa, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>within Africa selection, which was probably massive battles of larger and larger tribes</p>
<p>selecting for our social networking and savviness and, you know, probably all our conspiracy theory</p>
<p>genes are, you know, dating back from then. And, you know, so there&rsquo;s a lot of this mischievousness</p>
<p>in the history of human evolution that unfortunately is still present in, you know, many ugly forms</p>
<p>today, but probably contributed to our success as a species in wiping out other species.</p>
<p>It just sucks that we don&rsquo;t have neighboring species that are, you know, intelligent like us</p>
<p>that, but yet very different than us. So we have like, you know, dogs or wolves, I guess,</p>
<p>co evolved. They, they figured out how to neighbor up with humans in a friendly way and collaborate</p>
<p>and develop in time. You&rsquo;re describing this as if the wolves made a choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the wolves never had a say, that basically humans were just so overpowering</p>
<p>that they had captive wolves. And then at every generation killed off eight of the nine pups and</p>
<p>only kept the one that was milder. And it only takes a few generations to then sort of have pups</p>
<p>that are really mild. And so the Neanderthals weren&rsquo;t useful in the same way that wolves were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a question of useful. They were probably super useful. My thinking is that</p>
<p>they were scary, that basically something that almost resembles you is something that you try</p>
<p>to eliminate first. It&rsquo;s too close. Yeah. And speaking of, you know, species that are intelligent</p>
<p>and sort of what&rsquo;s left of evolution, it is a shame, exactly like you say, that so many different,</p>
<p>amazing life forms were extinct and the kind of boring ones remained. So if you look at the</p>
<p>dinosaurs, I mean, the diversity that they had, if you look at sub, you know, like there&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>many different lineages of life that were just abruptly killed. And yet out of that death emerged,</p>
<p>you know, many new kinds of really awesome lineages. Do you think there was in the history of</p>
<p>life on earth species that may be still alive today that are more intelligent than humans?</p>
<p>And we just don&rsquo;t know. So there&rsquo;s a case to be made for dolphins. Like if you look at their brains,</p>
<p>if you look at the way that they play, if you look at the way that they learn, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have opposable thumbs and we do. So, you know, that probably made a big difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying to think that like, not terrifying, I don&rsquo;t know how to feel about it,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re more intelligent than us. It&rsquo;s like the hitchhiker&rsquo;s guide.</p>
<p>I know. But how do you define intelligence? Basically, like I was saying last time,</p>
<p>you know, stupid is a stupid does and smart is a smart does. So if the dolphins are basically</p>
<p>super smart, figured out the meaning of life and just go around playing with water all day,</p>
<p>which is probably the meaning of life, then we wouldn&rsquo;t know because all they&rsquo;re doing is kicking</p>
<p>water just like sharks are and sharks are probably pretty stupid. So basically it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>sort of judge a species intelligence unless they kind of go out of their way to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s instructive for our understanding of any kind of life form.</p>
<p>You know, I recently talked to Sara Seager looking for life out there on other planets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be fascinating to think if we discover a habitable planet outside of Earth in one day,</p>
<p>maybe many centuries away, or be able to travel with like a robot there, how would we actually</p>
<p>know that this species would probably be able to detect that it&rsquo;s a living being? But how would we</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s an intelligent being? I mean, it&rsquo;s both exciting and terrifying to sort of come face</p>
<p>to face with a life form that&rsquo;s of another world. Like something that clearly is moving in a,</p>
<p>how would you say, like a deliberate way, and to then like ask, well, how do I ask that thing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s intelligent?</p>
<p>No, but the question that you&rsquo;re asking is applicable to every species on the Earth now.</p>
<p>On Earth now, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. So basically, you know, dolphins are a great example. We know that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, clearly capable hardware wise and behavior wise of intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, how do we communicate? So basically, if your question is about crossing species</p>
<p>boundaries of communication, the way that I want to put it is that humans have achieved</p>
<p>a level of sophistication in our behaviors, in our communication, in our language, in our ways</p>
<p>of expressing ourselves, that I have no doubt that if we encountered a human like form of</p>
<p>intelligence, we&rsquo;d figure out their language in a few weeks. Like, it&rsquo;d be just fine. As long as,</p>
<p>you know, of course, they&rsquo;re both trusting each other, not annihilating each other, and not sort</p>
<p>of fearing each other and attacking each other.</p>
<p>What about, let me ask, just out of curiosity into science fiction land a little bit.</p>
<p>So clearly, you&rsquo;re one of the top scientists in the world. So if we were to discover,</p>
<p>an alien life form, you would be brought in to study its genetics. Do you think the epigenome</p>
<p>that we talked about, the genome, the code, the digital code that underlies that alien life form</p>
<p>would be similar to ours? Like the, in fundamental ways, maybe not exactly, but in fundamental ways,</p>
<p>of how it&rsquo;s structured?</p>
<p>Yeah. So you&rsquo;re getting to the very definition of what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Of how it&rsquo;s structured. Yeah. So you&rsquo;re getting to the very definition of life. You&rsquo;re getting to</p>
<p>the very definition of what makes life, life, and how do we decode that life? And it&rsquo;s so easy to</p>
<p>think that every life form would basically have to, you know, like oxygen, have to like heat from</p>
<p>the sun and rely on sort of being in the habitable zone of, you know, its solar system and so on and</p>
<p>so forth. But I think we have to sort of go beyond this sort of, oh, life on another planet must be</p>
<p>exactly like life is on earth. Because of course, life on earth happens to rely on the proximity to</p>
<p>the sun and benefit from that amount of energy. But we&rsquo;re talking at timescales of human life,</p>
<p>where we kind of live, I don&rsquo;t know, between, and I&rsquo;m going to be super wide here. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>live between six earth months and, you know, 200 earth months or 200 earth years. So basically,</p>
<p>if you look at the timescale that we inhabit on earth, it is very much dictated by the amount of</p>
<p>energy that we receive from the sun. If you look at, I don&rsquo;t know, Europa, you know, the smallest,</p>
<p>the fourth smallest moon of Jupiter, the smallest of the Galilean moons, and also the smallest</p>
<p>in its distance from Jupiter. It has an iron core, it has a rock exterior, it has ice all around it,</p>
<p>and it has probably massive liquid oceans underneath. And the gravitational pull of</p>
<p>Jupiter is probably creating all kinds of movement under that ice. How did life evolve on earth?</p>
<p>Yes, sure. Life now, most of life that we above the surface look at, has to do with exploiting</p>
<p>the solar energy for, you know, our daily behavior. But that&rsquo;s not the case everywhere</p>
<p>on the planet. If you look at the bottom of the ocean, there are hydrothermal vents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s both black smokers and white smokers, and they are near these volcanic, you know, ducts</p>
<p>that basically emanate a massive amount of energy from the core of our planet. What does life need?</p>
<p>It needs energy. Does it need energy from the sun? It couldn&rsquo;t care less. Does it need energy from,</p>
<p>you know, the earth itself? Yeah, possibly. It could use that. And if you look at how did life</p>
<p>evolve on, you know, on earth, there are many theories. I mean, a kind of silly theory is that</p>
<p>it came from outer space, that basically there&rsquo;s a meteorite out there that sort of landed on earth</p>
<p>and brought with it DNA material. I think it&rsquo;s a little silly because it kind of pushes the buck</p>
<p>down the road. Basically the next question is how did it evolve over there? Whereas our planet has</p>
<p>basically all of the right ingredients, why wouldn&rsquo;t evolve here? So basically let&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of ignore that one. And now the two other competing hypotheses are from the outside in</p>
<p>or from the inside out. What&rsquo;s that mean? From the outside in means from the surface to the</p>
<p>bottom of the ocean. From the inside out means from the bottom of the ocean to the surface.</p>
<p>So life on the surface is pretty brutal.</p>
<p>Life obviously evolved in the water and then there was an out of water event.</p>
<p>But basically before it exited, it was clearly in the water, which is a much nicer and shielded</p>
<p>environment. So just to be clear, on the surface, are you referring to the surface of the sea or</p>
<p>the bottom of the sea? Versus the bottom of the sea. And you&rsquo;re saying life on the surface is</p>
<p>harsh. Life outside the water is horrible. It takes huge amounts of evolutionary innovations</p>
<p>to sustain living outside the water. That&rsquo;s so interesting. Why is that? So it&rsquo;s easier to,</p>
<p>life is easier in the water. Maybe, see, I&rsquo;m telling dolphins are onto something.</p>
<p>We are 70% water. No, dolphins went back into the water.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, because dolphins are mammals.</p>
<p>Of course. Yeah.</p>
<p>Interesting. Well, again, they might be smarter. They went back. They&rsquo;re like, screw this.</p>
<p>So if you basically think about the fact that we are 70% water,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically transporting the sea with us outside the sea. If we don&rsquo;t have water for about</p>
<p>24 hours, we&rsquo;re dry. And if you look at life under the sea, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a diver,</p>
<p>but when you go diving, your brain explodes. Again, when I say the boring life forms is what</p>
<p>we see all the time, like tetrapods. I mean, what a stupid boring body plan. Seriously. Just go dive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see that a tiny little minority of the stuff under the sea, under the surface of the sea</p>
<p>is actually tetrapods. It&rsquo;s like snails with all kinds of crazy appendages and colors and round</p>
<p>things and five way symmetric things and eight way symmetric things, all kinds of crazy body plans.</p>
<p>And only the tetrapod fish managed to get out. And then they gave rise to all the boring plans we</p>
<p>kind of see today of basically, you know, humans with four limbs, birds with four limbs, lizards</p>
<p>with four limbs, and you know, right? It&rsquo;s kind of boring. If you look at, by comparison, life</p>
<p>underwater is teeming with diversity. So now let&rsquo;s roll back the clock and basically say,</p>
<p>where did life in the ocean come from, from the surface or from the bottom?</p>
<p>Exactly. Those two options that you were mentioning.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So basically life on the surface is one option. And then the idea there is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tides with the moon and the sun sort of causing all this movement. And this movement is</p>
<p>basically causing nutrients to sort of, you know, coalesce and, you know, bounce around,</p>
<p>et cetera. That&rsquo;s one option. The second option, massive amount of energy from the core of our</p>
<p>the core of our planet basically exploited, leading to these basic ingredients of life forms.</p>
<p>And what are these basic ingredients? Metabolism, being able to take energy from the environment</p>
<p>and put it as part of yourself. Metabolism, it basically means transformation. Again, in the</p>
<p>Greek, it basically means taking stuff from, you know, like nutrients or energy source or anything,</p>
<p>and then making it your own. The second one is compartmentalization. If there&rsquo;s no notion of self,</p>
<p>there can&rsquo;t be evolution. You have to know where your own boundaries end and where the non self</p>
<p>boundaries begin. And that&rsquo;s basically the lipid bilayer nowadays, which is extremely simple to</p>
<p>form. It&rsquo;s basically just a bunch of lipids and then they eventually just self organize into a</p>
<p>membrane. So that&rsquo;s a very natural way of forming a self. And then the third component is replication.</p>
<p>Replication doesn&rsquo;t need to be self replication. It could be A helps make more of B, B helps make</p>
<p>more of C and C helps make more of A. Any kind of self reinforcement is what you need to ignite</p>
<p>the process of evolution. After you&rsquo;ve ignited that process, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to say all</p>
<p>hell breaks loose, but all paradise breaks loose. So basically you then boom, you know, have life</p>
<p>going. And the moment you have A, B, C, some kind of thing looping back onto A, you can make</p>
<p>modifications and you can improve. And then you let natural selection work. Is there some element</p>
<p>of that that&rsquo;s like some state representation that stores information? Like maybe I should say</p>
<p>information. Absolutely. We like to think of life as the information propagation, which is DNA,</p>
<p>the messenger, which is RNA, and then the action, which is protein. So basically DNA,</p>
<p>we think is an essential part of life. That&rsquo;s where the storage is. And therefore that early</p>
<p>life forms must have had some kind of storage medium DNA. If you look at how life actually</p>
<p>evolved, DNA was invented much later. Proteins were invented later. And RNA was fine by itself,</p>
<p>thank you very much, in an RNA world. So the early version of life as we know it today was in fact</p>
<p>RNA molecules performing all of the functions. The RNA molecule itself was the protein actuator</p>
<p>here by creating three dimensional folds through self hybridization. Self what? Self hybridization.</p>
<p>So basically the same way that DNA molecules can hybridize with themselves and basically</p>
<p>form this double helix. The single stranded RNA molecule can form partial double helices</p>
<p>in various places, creating structure as if you had a long string with complimentary parts,</p>
<p>and you could then sort of design kind of like origami like structures that will fold onto</p>
<p>themselves. And then you can make any shape from that. That early RNA world eventually got to</p>
<p>replication, where enzymes encoded in RNA would replicate RNA itself. And then that process</p>
<p>basically kicked off evolution. And that process of evolution then led to major innovations.</p>
<p>The first innovation was translation. So you start with an RNA molecule and you translate it</p>
<p>into another kind of form. And that&rsquo;s the first kind of encoding. You&rsquo;re like, well,</p>
<p>do you need some kind of code? Yeah, but the code was in fact one thing. It was conflated</p>
<p>with the actuators. The actuators were separated from the code only later on. So you first had</p>
<p>the self replicating code, which was also the actuator. And then you kind of have a functionalization,</p>
<p>partitioning of the functionalization, a sub functionalization of the proteins that are now</p>
<p>going to be the workhorse of life, but they&rsquo;re not self replicating. The code remains the RNA.</p>
<p>So the most beautiful and most complex RNA machine known to man is the ribosome.</p>
<p>The ribosome is this massive factory that is able to translate RNA into protein.</p>
<p>The ribosome, I mean, if you want, I don&rsquo;t know, divine intervention in the history of life,</p>
<p>the ribosome is it. That&rsquo;s one of the great invention in the history of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah. But again, you can&rsquo;t think of great inventions as one time steps. They&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>you know, the culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures for life</p>
<p>preservation that won out. And then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteins,</p>
<p>all the other ones basically died out. And then the life forms that were using the modern ribosome</p>
<p>were basically the more successful ones because it could make proteins. And now those proteins</p>
<p>are much more versatile because RNA only has four bases. Proteins eventually have 20 amino acids,</p>
<p>not initially, but eventually. And then they can form in much more complex shapes and they can</p>
<p>create all kinds of additional machines. One of which is reverse transcriptase. So you basically</p>
<p>now have RNA. Again, we like to think of transcription as the normal, reverse transcription</p>
<p>as the oddball. Well, RNA preceded DNA. So reverse transcription actually was the first invention</p>
<p>before transcription itself. So basically RNA invents proteins, RNA and proteins together</p>
<p>invent DNA. So you now have a more stable medium and more stable backbone with two helices instead</p>
<p>of one, two strands instead of one, the double helix. And RNA basically says, listen, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to delegate all information storage to DNA and I&rsquo;m going to delegate most actuation</p>
<p>to proteins. But that&rsquo;s to you is not like a, that&rsquo;s just an efficiency thing. It&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>fundamentally new innovation. That&rsquo;s why when you&rsquo;re asking is a separate information storage</p>
<p>medium a definition of life? I&rsquo;m like, no, any kind of self preservation, self reinforcement.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t need to be RNA based initially. It didn&rsquo;t need to be self replication initially.</p>
<p>You just need to have enough RNA molecules randomly arising that reinforce each other</p>
<p>that ultimately lead to the, you know, the closing of that loop and the ignition of the evolutionary</p>
<p>process. Can we just rewind a little bit? Like if you were to bet all your money on the two options</p>
<p>in terms of where life started at the bottom of the ocean. I don&rsquo;t know if this is answerable, but</p>
<p>how hard is the first step or if there&rsquo;s something interesting you can say about that first leap</p>
<p>about from not life to life. Yeah. I think it&rsquo;s inevitable on earth or just in the universe.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s inevitable. If you look at Europa, you know, going back the moon of Jupiter. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a really nice song by Santana. Europa basically has all the ingredients. It has,</p>
<p>you know, the core that can emit energy. It has the shielding through the ice sheet,</p>
<p>protecting it just like an atmosphere would. It even has a layer of oxygen,</p>
<p>probably sufficiently dense to sustain life. So my guess is that there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>independently a reason life form already teeming in Europa because as soon as it today.</p>
<p>Is that exciting or terrifying to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, as a scientist, I can&rsquo;t wait to see non DNA based life forms. I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>because we are so born in, you know, sort of, as I would say in French, but basically we&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>you know, we are so narrow minded in our thinking of what life should look like that I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>for all that to just be blown away by the discovery of life elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let me bring you into another science fiction scenario. So on that point, if we discovered</p>
<p>life on Europa and you were brought in, you seem very excited, but how would you start looking at</p>
<p>that life in a way that&rsquo;s useful to you as a scientist, but also not going to kill all of us?</p>
<p>So like to me, it&rsquo;s a little bit scary because not, not because it&rsquo;s a malevolent life. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dictator petting like a cat, it&rsquo;s evil, but just the way life is, it seems to be very good at</p>
<p>conquering other life. So there&rsquo;s a lot of science fiction movies based on that principle.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s sort of what causes the public to be so scared. But if you think about sort of,</p>
<p>would Europa life be scared of humans coming over and taking over? Chances are no, not even like</p>
<p>earth bacteria because earth bacteria would be wiped out in an instant in this foreign world</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know how to metabolize energy that doesn&rsquo;t come from the types of energy sources</p>
<p>that are here. The levels of acidity may just kill us all off. And at the same way, in the converse</p>
<p>way, if you bring life from Europa on earth, it&rsquo;ll die instantly because it&rsquo;s too hot or because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to know how to cope with, I don&rsquo;t know, the sun&rsquo;s radiation so close to these</p>
<p>completely inhabitable zone by their standards. So what we call the habitable zone might actually be</p>
<p>the inhabitable zone. Inhabitable for them. So the difference, if the environments are sufficiently</p>
<p>different, you think we&rsquo;ll just not be able to even attack each other and the basic. It&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>massive amounts of engineering to create machines that will go there and sample the oceans,</p>
<p>basically drill through the layers of ice to basically sample and see what life is like</p>
<p>there and detecting it will probably be trivial. It definitely won&rsquo;t be DNA based. It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to send a sequencer, but it&rsquo;ll be some other kind of combination of chemicals</p>
<p>that will look nonrandom. So if you had to bet, if I took that life form we find in Europa and</p>
<p>like put it on a sandwich that you&rsquo;re eating and like eat that sandwich. It&rsquo;ll taste just fine.</p>
<p>Well, I know about that. Will it taste fine? That&rsquo;s interesting. So the other question is,</p>
<p>do we have taste receptors for this? So where does our taste come from? It&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>adaptations to chemical molecules that we are used to seeing. We don&rsquo;t have taste buds for</p>
<p>things we don&rsquo;t even know about. So we won&rsquo;t be able to know that this chemical tastes funny.</p>
<p>But you think it won&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s likely not to be dangerous. Like it won&rsquo;t know how to even</p>
<p>interact. Do you think our immune system will even detect that something weird is going on?</p>
<p>Probably. And it&rsquo;ll be very easy to detect because it&rsquo;ll be very different from us.</p>
<p>Very weird.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be able to sort of attack. I mean, the scene from, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Independence Day where like they&rsquo;re communicating with the alien computer and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ooh, I&rsquo;m in. I mean, it&rsquo;s hilarious because like Macs and PCs have trouble communicating.</p>
<p>I mean, let alone an alien technology or even alien DNA.</p>
<p>So, okay. Now I was talking about you being a scientist on earth, but say you were a scientist</p>
<p>that was shipped over to Europa to investigate if there&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>what would you look for in terms of signs of life?</p>
<p>Life is unmistakable, I would say. The way that life transforms a planet surrounding it</p>
<p>is not the kind of thing that you would expect from the physical laws alone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I would say that as soon as life arises, it creates this compartmentalization.</p>
<p>It starts pushing things away. It starts sort of keeping things inside that are self.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole signature that you can see from that. So when I was organizing my meaning</p>
<p>of life symposium, my friend who&rsquo;s an astrophysicist, basically we were deciding on what</p>
<p>would be the themes for the symposium. And then I said, well, we&rsquo;re going to have biology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have physics. And she&rsquo;s like, oh, come on. Biology is just a small part of physics.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s a small part of physics.</p>
<p>And I mean, in many ways it is, but my immediate answer was, no, no, no, no, wait.</p>
<p>Life challenges physics. It supersedes physics. It sort of fights against physics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I would look for in Europe. I would basically look for this fight against physics</p>
<p>for anything that sort of signatures of not just entropy at work, not just things diffusing away,</p>
<p>not just gravitational pools, but clear signatures of, you remember when I was talking earlier about</p>
<p>this whole selection for environments, selection for biospheres, for ecosystems, for these multi</p>
<p>organism form of life. And I think that&rsquo;s sort of the first thing that you can look for, you know,</p>
<p>chemical signatures that are not simply predicted from the reactions you would get randomly.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful way to look at life. So you&rsquo;re basically leveraging some energy source to enable</p>
<p>you to resist the physics of the universe.</p>
<p>Fighting against physics. But that&rsquo;s the first transformation. If you look at humans,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re way past that.</p>
<p>What do you mean by transformation?</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s layers. I sort of see life, you know, when we talk about the meaning of life,</p>
<p>life can be construed at many levels. We talked about life in the simplest form of sort of the</p>
<p>ignition of evolution. And that&rsquo;s sort of the basic definition that you can check off. Yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s alive. But when Alexander the Great was asked to whom do you owe your life to your teachers</p>
<p>or to your parents? And Alexander the Great answered, I owe to my parents the zin, the life</p>
<p>itself. And I owe to my teachers the f zin, like euphony. F means good, the opposite of cacophony,</p>
<p>which means, you know, bad. So f zin, in his words, was basically living a human life.</p>
<p>A proper life. So basically we can go from the zin to the f zin. And that transformation has taken</p>
<p>several additional leaps. So basically, you know, life on Europa, I&rsquo;m pretty sure has gotten to the</p>
<p>stage of A makes B makes C makes A again. But getting to the f zin is a whole other level. And</p>
<p>that level requires cooperation. That level requires altruism. That level requires specialization.</p>
<p>Remember how we were talking about the RNA specializing into DNA for storage, proteins,</p>
<p>and then compartmentalizations. And if you look at prokaryotic life, there&rsquo;s no nucleus. It&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>one soup of things intermingling. If you look at eukaryotic life, there&rsquo;s no nucleus. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>eukaryotic life. Again, U for true, good, you know. So a eukaryote basically has a nucleus,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you compartmentalize further the organization of the information storage</p>
<p>from all of the daily activities. If you look at a human body plan or any animal,</p>
<p>you have a compartmentalization of the germline. You basically have one lineage that will basically</p>
<p>be saved for the future generations. And everything outside that lineage is almost superfluous. If you</p>
<p>think about it, the rest of your body, all it does is ensure that that lineage will make it</p>
<p>to the next generation, that these germlines will make it to the next generation. The rest is</p>
<p>packaging. I&rsquo;m starting to be so blunt. And if you look at nutrition, you know, we&rsquo;re deuterostomes.</p>
<p>What does deuterostome mean? Deutero means second, where this is the second mouth. The first mouth</p>
<p>is actually down here, it&rsquo;s the oesophagus. So deuterostomes have evolved a second layer of</p>
<p>eating, kind of like alien with the two mouths. So you can think of us as alien where the first</p>
<p>mouth is up here and then the second mouth is down there. Is the first mouth just the</p>
<p>physical manipulation of the food to make it more consumable? Correct. And basically, again,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at a worm, it&rsquo;s an extremely simple life form. It basically has a mouth,</p>
<p>it has an anus and it has, you know, just some organs in between that consume the food and just</p>
<p>spit out poo. Humans are basically a fancy form of that. So you basically have the mouth,</p>
<p>you have the digestive tract, and then you have limbs to get better at getting food.</p>
<p>You have eyesight, hearing, et cetera, to get better at getting food. And then you have,</p>
<p>of course, the germline and all of this food part, it&rsquo;s just auxiliary to the germline.</p>
<p>So you basically have layers of addition, of compartmentalization, of specialization</p>
<p>on top of this zine to get all the way to the Earth zine.</p>
<p>Yeah. So like the worm is like Windows 95, very few features, very basic. And then</p>
<p>us humans are like Windows Vista, Windows 10, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Well, a few innovations beyond that.</p>
<p>Beyond that, all right. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Windows 2000, at least we&rsquo;re that way.</p>
<p>So, okay. That&rsquo;s such a fascinating way to look at life as a set of transformations.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So like, is there some interesting transformations to our</p>
<p>history here on Earth that like appeal to you?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And what are the most brilliant innovations and transformations?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is such a fascinating question. Of course, like,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re talking about basic, basic life forms and we&rsquo;re talking about eukaryotic life</p>
<p>forms. And then the next big transformation is multicellular life forms, where the specialization</p>
<p>separates the germ line from everything else that accompanies it and sort of carries it.</p>
<p>And then that specialization then sort of has this massive new innovation, like above the second</p>
<p>mouth, which is this massive brain. And this massive brain is basically something that arises</p>
<p>much, much later on. Basically, you know, notochords, like having the first spinal cord,</p>
<p>this whole concept that along with these very simple layers, you basically now have</p>
<p>a coordinating agent and this coordinating agent is starting to make decisions.</p>
<p>And remember when we were talking about free will, I mean, you know, as a worm is hunting for food,</p>
<p>oh, it has plenty of free will. It can choose to, you know, follow chemotaxis to the left or</p>
<p>chemotaxis to the right. And maybe that&rsquo;s free will because it&rsquo;s unpredictable beyond a certain level.</p>
<p>So you basically now have more and more decision making and coordination of all of these different</p>
<p>body parts and organs by a central operating system, a central machine that basically will</p>
<p>control the rest of the body. And the other thing that I love talking about is the different</p>
<p>timescales at which things happen. You know, we&rsquo;re talking about the human epigenome before.</p>
<p>The human epigenome is basically able to find what genes should be expressed in response to</p>
<p>environmental stimuli in the order of minutes and basically receive a stimulus, transfer all that</p>
<p>data through these humongously long string of searching and then sort of find what genes to</p>
<p>turn on and then create all that. All of that is happening in the timescale of minutes. Basically,</p>
<p>you know, three minutes to half an hour. That&rsquo;s the expression response. But our daily life</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen on the order of three minutes to half an hour. It happens on the order of</p>
<p>milliseconds. Like I throw a ball at you, you catch it right away. No gene expression changes</p>
<p>there. You just don&rsquo;t have time to do that. So you basically have a layer of control built on</p>
<p>a hardware that supports it, but that hardware itself lives in a different timescale than the</p>
<p>controlling machine on top of that. Is that an accident, by the way? Is that like a feature?</p>
<p>Is it, was it possible for life to have evolved where the hour, the daily life of the organism</p>
<p>as it interacts with its environment was on a timescale similar to the way our internals work?</p>
<p>If you look at trees, they look kind of boring and stupid. You&rsquo;re like looking at the tree like</p>
<p>stupid. If you speed up the movie of a tree from spring until October, you&rsquo;ll be like, oh my God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intelligent. And the reason for that is that at that timescale, the tree is basically saying,</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m looking for a, you know, a thing to catch onto. Ooh, I just caught onto that. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>grow more here. I&rsquo;m going to spoil out there, et cetera. Like I can see the trees in my garden,</p>
<p>just growing and sort of, you know, looping around. And it&rsquo;s all a matter of timescale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of timescale. And if you look at the human timescale, remember we were talking</p>
<p>about neoteny the last time around. The whole fact that our young are pretty useless until,</p>
<p>you know, maybe, you know, a few months of age, if not a few years of age, if not, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>getting out of college. And then we, we basically hold them enabling their brain to continue being</p>
<p>malleable and infusing it with knowledge and thoughts as, you know, that period of neoteny</p>
<p>increases and expands. If you fast forward, I don&rsquo;t know, another million years.</p>
<p>So humans have only been around, you know, different from apes for about that long.</p>
<p>Jump another unit of that, another human chimp divergence. What could happen</p>
<p>from an evolutionary timescale? A lot. One of the things that&rsquo;s happening already is expansion of</p>
<p>human lifespan. We have longer and longer periods before we mature. And we have longer and longer</p>
<p>periods before we have babies. So intergenerational distance is, you know, grown from, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>16 years to 40 years. You&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s in the genetics. No, no, not necessarily. But it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of an environmental tendency that&rsquo;s happening. But as we medically expand human</p>
<p>lifespan, the generations might actually be pushed instead of 40 years to 60 years, to 100 years.</p>
<p>Like if we look at the long arc of the evolutionary history. Exactly. So as we start thinking about</p>
<p>intergalactic travel now, sorry, that&rsquo;s a heck of a transition. Yeah. So let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. As we, as a species start thinking about, I&rsquo;m talking about these transitions</p>
<p>that are happening, right? And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s awesome. Continue along these transitions.</p>
<p>What does the future hold in the next million years? So the concept of us going to another planet</p>
<p>and that taking three human lifetimes might be a joke if the human lifetime starts being 400 years</p>
<p>or 800 years. So imagine, it&rsquo;s all time scale. It&rsquo;s all time scale. It&rsquo;s just different time scales.</p>
<p>You asked me offline whether I would like to live forever. I mean, my answer is absolutely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many different types of forevers. One forever is, do I want to live today forever?</p>
<p>Kind of like Groundhog Day. And the answer is absolutely. The stuff that I want to learn today</p>
<p>will probably take a lifetime just to learn, you know, basically to clear my to do list for the day.</p>
<p>You mean like relive the day and then, and then pick up different things from the richness of</p>
<p>the experiences that are all in today. There&rsquo;s just so much happening in the world every single</p>
<p>day. So much knowledge that has happened already that just to catch up on that will probably take</p>
<p>me around forever. On that, on that point, I just, I would just love to see you in the Groundhog movie</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re so naturally as a scientist, but just the way your mind works beautifully,</p>
<p>just all the richness of the experiences that you will pick up from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful visual. I try to live each day as if it was Groundhog. I&rsquo;m basically every</p>
<p>single day waking up and saying, all right, how would Bill Murray get out of that one?</p>
<p>Well, you know what, on a funny tangent, I got a chance to go to a Neuralink demonstration event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually familiar with Neuralink. And I talked to Elon for a while. And one of the</p>
<p>funny things he said on his Groundhog Day thing is, you know, it&rsquo;s a beautiful dream to eventually</p>
<p>be able to replay our memories. So we&rsquo;re kind of these recording machines. Our brain is kind of,</p>
<p>maybe a noisy recording machine of memories. And it would be beautiful if we can someday in the</p>
<p>future, maybe far into the future, be able to, like in the Groundhog Day situation, replay that.</p>
<p>And the funny comment that stuck with me is he said that maybe this, our conversation now,</p>
<p>is a replay of a previous memory. And that stuck with me because it would probably be my replay.</p>
<p>You know, who the hell am I? I&rsquo;m just an idiot guy. But like Elon Musk is, you know, probably</p>
<p>because of SpaceX and so on, is probably going to be remembered as a special person,</p>
<p>one of our special apes in history. So if I wanted to replay a memory, probably be that one. You know,</p>
<p>talking to Elon for a while. That&rsquo;s an interesting possibility from, if we think about time scales,</p>
<p>if we think about the richness of the experience through time that we humans take and be able to</p>
<p>replay some aspects of that, of that biology, that&rsquo;s super interesting. But anyway, sorry for</p>
<p>the tangents. Let&rsquo;s, yeah, you were talking about time scales and the expansion of the human lifetime</p>
<p>and the idea of intergalactic travel. Yeah. No, but you&rsquo;re laughing about this. I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re laughing about this. You&rsquo;re talking about this. You&rsquo;re talking about exploring alien worlds</p>
<p>and going to other planets. I mean, you know, when Sarah was here, she was talking about sort of going</p>
<p>to other planets when we find these life. I mean, I&rsquo;m just very naturally, given the topics that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve approached, talking about the timescale at which this will happen. So you think eventually</p>
<p>we will human or life, life will expand out into the universe. The point that I&rsquo;m trying to make</p>
<p>is that an intergalactic species will probably find ways to engineer its biology in order to</p>
<p>expand the way that we experience time, expand the timescale that we experience. And going back to</p>
<p>this whole concept of, you know, would I like to live forever? Yes, I&rsquo;d like to live forever. Even</p>
<p>if it was, even if it was stuck on the same day, I&rsquo;d love to live forever because I would finally</p>
<p>have time to do all these things that I want to do. But if living forever actually comes with a perk</p>
<p>of watching the whole world evolve forever, I mean, that&rsquo;s a huge perk. And I would, you know, just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll never get boring, just a never changing world. And then the mind, you know, sort of</p>
<p>the experiment that I want you to do is to also ask, what if I wanted to live forever</p>
<p>one day at a time every year or one day at a time every decade, would you choose that?</p>
<p>Or you would wake up and the world would be 10 years later every single day you wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite of Groundhog Day where basically you always wake up and it&rsquo;s always 10 years later.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s such a powerful, interesting concept that life is more</p>
<p>interesting if you&rsquo;re, of all the life forms on earth, that you&rsquo;re the slowest one.</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p>Like trees have it right.</p>
<p>Like trees have it right. Olive trees. Like, you know, they&rsquo;ve been there since the Minoan</p>
<p>civilization. And you know, that takes us back to the question you asked about sort of</p>
<p>the transformations that have happened in humanity. The Minoan civilization is one of them.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this paper that was published just a couple of years ago by one of my friends</p>
<p>that basically looked at the genetic makeup of the Minoans and the Mycenaeans in ancient</p>
<p>Greece and how they relate to modern Greeks. And they found that indeed there was very little gene</p>
<p>flow from, you know, the outside. And, you know, it&rsquo;s fantastic to sort of think about these</p>
<p>amazing civilizations that transformed the way that human thought happens, that basically</p>
<p>looked for rules in nature, that looked for principles, that looked for the standard of beauty,</p>
<p>not human beauty, but beauty in the natural world. This whole concept that the world must</p>
<p>be elegant and there must be deeper ways of understanding that world. To me, that&rsquo;s a massive</p>
<p>transformation of our species, similar to, you know, the earlier transformation that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about of even involving a brain, of, you know, learning how to communicate language or the</p>
<p>evolution of eyesight. If you look at sort of, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about these worms crawling</p>
<p>around and then sensing which direction are the chemicals more abundant, you know, chemotaxis. So</p>
<p>eventually they grow a nose. Eventually they grow, I mean, when I say nose, I mean, ways of sensing</p>
<p>chemicals. That&rsquo;s probably one of the earliest senses. You know, we always talk about how deep</p>
<p>rooted it is in our brain. That&rsquo;s one of the early senses. If you look at hearing, that&rsquo;s a much later</p>
<p>sense. If you look at eyesight, that&rsquo;s an intermediate sense where you&rsquo;re basically sensing</p>
<p>where the light direction comes from. That&rsquo;s probably something that life didn&rsquo;t need until</p>
<p>it got, you know, into the surface and so on and so forth. So there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know, milestones.</p>
<p>And I was talking about the latest milestone, which is LIGO, last time of being able to detect</p>
<p>gravitational waves and sort of being able to sort of have a sense that humans haven&rsquo;t had before.</p>
<p>So you see that as a yet another transformation. It gives us an extra little sense.</p>
<p>Of course. And now if you go back to this history of ancient Greece, I mean, this transformation</p>
<p>that happened, I mean, of course, the Egyptians had this incredible, you know, civilization for</p>
<p>thousands of years. But what happened in Greece was this whole concept of let&rsquo;s break things down</p>
<p>and understand the natural world. Let&rsquo;s break things down and understand physics. Let&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>build rules around architecture, about around elegance, around, you know, statues and tragedy.</p>
<p>I mean, another question that you asked me in passing was this whole concept of embracing the</p>
<p>good and the bad, embracing the full range of human emotions. And if you look at Greek tragedy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the definition of that. It&rsquo;s, I mean, drama. I mean, again, it&rsquo;s a Greek word,</p>
<p>but the whole concept of some problems that are just so vast and large that dying is the easy way</p>
<p>out. That death, oh, that&rsquo;s the easy solution. You know, so I want to touch a little bit on that</p>
<p>point and sort of talk about this concept that life supersedes physics and that the brain supersedes</p>
<p>life. That basically we have a brain that can decide to not follow evolution&rsquo;s path. We can</p>
<p>decide to not have children. We can decide to not eat. We can decide to suicide. We can decide to</p>
<p>sort of abolish communication with the outside world. I mean, all the things that make us human,</p>
<p>we can basically decide not to do that. And that is basically when the brain itself is basically</p>
<p>is basically superseding what evolution program is for. Okay. So one of the, it&rsquo;s okay. My mind</p>
<p>was already blown at the beautiful formulation of the idea that life is a system that resists</p>
<p>physics and our brain, or perhaps the content of it, or however it may be functionally, our brain</p>
<p>is a thing that resists life. Yes. Yes. You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re so, you&rsquo;re so brilliant.</p>
<p>But, but, but, but, but I want you to see all of that as continuum. Basically, you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>talking about the sort of individual transformations, but it&rsquo;s a path that, that humanity has been</p>
<p>taking. It&rsquo;s a transformation. It&rsquo;s a path of transformation. And then I want us to think about</p>
<p>what it truly means to become human, like the F zine. And you asked me about what motivated</p>
<p>my meaning of life symposium. What motivated it in part, I mean, of course it was an inside joke</p>
<p>of turning 42, but what motivated it in part was actually a midlife crisis. So the joke that I</p>
<p>always like to say is Christos Papadimitriou, a famous Greek professor who was previously at</p>
<p>MIT, at Harvard, at Stanford, at Berkeley, everywhere. A brilliant, brilliant person. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually Costis&rsquo;s advisor. So Christos Papadimitriou likes to say that when you&rsquo;re an undergrad,</p>
<p>you work like a rat to get into grad school. And where you&rsquo;re a grad student, you work like a rat</p>
<p>to get your PhD. And where you&rsquo;re a postdoc, you work like a rat to get your assistant professor</p>
<p>position. And where you&rsquo;re an assistant professor, you work like a rat to become a full professor.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re a full professor, well, by then you&rsquo;re basically a rat.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So basically what happened to me is that I arrived at the end of the rat race.</p>
<p>You know, life is a rat race. You constantly have hurdles to jump over. You constantly have</p>
<p>tunnels and secret pathways. And I figured it all out. And eventually as I was turning 42,</p>
<p>I looked back and I was like, wow, that was an awesome rat race. But I&rsquo;m not a rat.</p>
<p>I basically got out of the labyrinth and I was like, I&rsquo;m not a rat, turns out.</p>
<p>Is that the first moment where you saw that you were in a rat race?</p>
<p>No, no, no. I&rsquo;ve known that I&rsquo;m in a rat race for a long time. It&rsquo;s so easy to be in a rat race.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to be an undergrad. But you have problem sets. And you know, we&rsquo;re all smart</p>
<p>people. You know, problem set, it has a solution. Somebody made it for you. You can just solve it.</p>
<p>Everything was made as a test. And you keep passing those tests and tests and tests and tests.</p>
<p>And you have tasks that are well defined. The PhD is a little different because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more open ended, but yet you have an advisor who&rsquo;s guiding you. And then you become a professor</p>
<p>and tenure is a well set defined set of tasks. And you do all that.</p>
<p>And at 42, I basically had bought a house, three kids, beautiful wife, tenure, awesome students,</p>
<p>tons of grants. Life was basically laid out for me. And that&rsquo;s when I had my main life crisis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when people usually buy a Harley Davidson. And they basically say, I need something new. I</p>
<p>need something different and to be young myself, et cetera. But basically that was my realization</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a rat race, that there&rsquo;s no rat race. It&rsquo;s over. That I have to basically think,</p>
<p>how do I fully instantiate myself? How do I complete my transformation into an actual human</p>
<p>being? Because it&rsquo;s very easy to sort of forget all the intangibles of life. It&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>just sort of think about the next task and the next task and it&rsquo;s all metrics. And you know,</p>
<p>what is the number of viewers I have? What is the number of publications I have? What is the number</p>
<p>of citations, the number of talks, the number of grants? It&rsquo;s very easy to quantify everything.</p>
<p>And then at some point you&rsquo;re like, this is real life. It&rsquo;s not a test anymore. And that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I told my wife early on. I was like, no, no, no, our life is not going to be let&rsquo;s put the kids</p>
<p>through college. And that, you know, maybe that&rsquo;s when I escaped the rat race. Maybe it continued</p>
<p>being a rat race. Maybe the next step would have been, all right, how do I make sure that my kid is</p>
<p>first in class? How do I make sure that they&rsquo;re, you know, into the greatest college? And then,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re into college. And then you&rsquo;re like 60.</p>
<p>So how do you, how do you escape? What is the, is there a light at the end of the tunnel of a</p>
<p>midlife crisis? So, so you should watch that symposium because the videos were transformative</p>
<p>to me and to many others. So basically the advice that I received from all of my friends was so</p>
<p>meaningful. This, you know, there&rsquo;s some, some advice that basically says you have to constantly</p>
<p>maintain unachievable goals. Goals that you can make progress towards, but you can never be fully</p>
<p>done with. And I think that&rsquo;s almost playing into the sort of rat race thing. Like basically make</p>
<p>sure that there&rsquo;s more obstacles for your little rat persona to jump through. So that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>possibility. So first of all, watch, is it available somewhere? It&rsquo;s on YouTube, just Google,</p>
<p>Google meaning of life symposium. I should have known this. I mean, you should have told me this.</p>
<p>This is awesome. Okay. This is great. But, and also like, you know, saying rat race is, you know,</p>
<p>if we look at ratatouille, it&rsquo;s not, I mean, that&rsquo;s a beautiful, that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing of,</p>
<p>of, of challenges and overcoming challenges. That could be fundamentally the meaning of life is,</p>
<p>to see life as a set of challenges and to fully engage in the overcoming of those challenges.</p>
<p>I would say that that&rsquo;s embracing the rat race view of life. So, so a joke that we like to have</p>
<p>with my wife all the time is, we basically say, we, we, we pretend that we&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>all inclusive resort that we basically hired all these people to go on the Esplanade and play games</p>
<p>because we enjoy watching people playing on the Esplanade and we enjoy sort of laying and looking</p>
<p>at life and all the people biking and rollerblading and all of that. And then we&rsquo;ve paid all these</p>
<p>people in this all inclusive resort that we live in. And then what are we going to do today? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, Oh, I&rsquo;ve signed up for professor activities. It&rsquo;s going to be awesome. They, they, they lined</p>
<p>up a bunch of super smart MIT students for me to meet with. I&rsquo;m going to have a grant writing</p>
<p>meeting afterwards. It&rsquo;s going to be awesome. And then she signed up for a bunch of consulting</p>
<p>activities. It&rsquo;s going to be great. And then in the evening we just get back together and say,</p>
<p>Hey, how was your consulting today? So in a way, that&rsquo;s another view of life of basically,</p>
<p>wait a minute. If I was a gazillionaire, what would I choose to do? I would probably pay an</p>
<p>awesome university to give me an office there and just pay a bunch of super smart people to work</p>
<p>with me, even though they don&rsquo;t really want to, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In fact, I would</p>
<p>have exactly the life that I have now working my butt off every single day because it&rsquo;s so freaking</p>
<p>fulfilling. So let&rsquo;s clarify. It&rsquo;s just a beautiful way. It&rsquo;s almost like a video game view of life</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a set of, I mean, again, game is not perhaps a positive term, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it is a beautiful term. So do you, or do you not like the rat race view of life?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because it is fulfilling in some fundamental way.</p>
<p>The rat race is about the goal. My view of life is about the path. So again, quoting Greece.</p>
<p>Those folks have come up with some good stuff.</p>
<p>So this Odysseus Elites basically wrote this beautiful poem about sort of going through life</p>
<p>saying, as you go through your journey, impersonating Ulysses of his voyage,</p>
<p>he says, wish that the path is long and arduous because when you get to Ithaca,</p>
<p>Ithaca, you might realize that it was all about the path, not the destination.</p>
<p>So the rat race view of life makes it all about the destination. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>how do I get through the maze to get there? But the all inclusive resort view of life</p>
<p>is about the path. It&rsquo;s about, wow, today I couldn&rsquo;t wish for a better set of activities</p>
<p>all programmed for me to enjoy having my brain, having my body, having my senses and, you know,</p>
<p>the life that I have. So it&rsquo;s a very different kind of view. It&rsquo;s focused on the journey,</p>
<p>not on the destination.</p>
<p>So you mentioned kind of the ups and downs of life and the midlife crisis.</p>
<p>And right now you said focusing kind of on the journey,</p>
<p>but what the journey involves is ups and downs. Is there advice or any kind of thoughts</p>
<p>that you can elucidate about the downs in your life, the hard parts of your life and</p>
<p>how you got out or maybe not, or is there, how do you see the dark parts of life?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re asking this question because it&rsquo;s something that our society does</p>
<p>a terrible job at preparing us for. Every Hollywood movie has to have a happy ending.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous. You can count on your 10 fingers the number of bad ending movies that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever watched. And you probably wouldn&rsquo;t need all 10 fingers. We strive to tell everyone,</p>
<p>yes, you can succeed. Yes, you&rsquo;re a millionaire, just temporarily disabled. And yes, you know,</p>
<p>the prince will eventually figure out his princess and they will have a happily ever after ending.</p>
<p>And yes, the hero will be beaten and beaten and beaten, but you know that at the end of the movie,</p>
<p>the good guys will win. We need more movies where the bad guys win. We need more movies</p>
<p>where just everybody dies. Where just, you know, MacGyver doesn&rsquo;t figure out how to disable the</p>
<p>bomb and just explodes. You just need more movies that are more realistic about the fact that life</p>
<p>kind of sucks sometimes and it&rsquo;s okay. So again, growing up in Greece, I have been exposed to songs</p>
<p>that are not just sad, but they&rsquo;re miserable. So one of them comes to mind and it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>talking about this woman who&rsquo;s lamenting in the early morning about losing the joyful kid,</p>
<p>the joyful young man who basically died in the civil war in the arms of our own fellow citizens.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, if only he had died fighting the foreign forces, if only he had died at the,</p>
<p>you know, sides of the, you know, general, if only he had died with honor, I would be proud to have</p>
<p>lost the joyful kid. I mean, it&rsquo;s devastating, right? It&rsquo;s like, he didn&rsquo;t just die. He died</p>
<p>without honor. And my friend who was with me was listening to the song and she&rsquo;s like, this is</p>
<p>depressing. I&rsquo;m like, whoa, you have to listen to another one. It&rsquo;s not as sad. And she&rsquo;s like, what,</p>
<p>this one died with honor? So that&rsquo;s one example. It&rsquo;s a kind of a celebration of misery. No, no,</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, no. So let me give you a couple more examples and then I&rsquo;ll answer that question.</p>
<p>So another example is I picked up this book that I had from my childhood and I started reading</p>
<p>stories to my kids. And the first story is about these two children. One is really poor living on</p>
<p>the street and the other one is really rich, really living in the house in the bright light</p>
<p>above. And the poor one is wishing, looking at that window and wishing that he could have that</p>
<p>house. And the other one is at the window wishing that he was free, that he wasn&rsquo;t sick all the time,</p>
<p>that he could escape outside. It&rsquo;s only four pages long. And at the end, both children die.</p>
<p>One of them dies from cold, the other one dies from illness. And you&rsquo;re like, how is that even</p>
<p>a children&rsquo;s story? The next story, I&rsquo;m like, okay, that&rsquo;s fine. Let&rsquo;s skip this one. So I read</p>
<p>this to my kids and then I read the next one. And the next one is about this woman whose brother is</p>
<p>at war against the Turks and he is going to die. And she prays to the Virgin, please don&rsquo;t let him</p>
<p>die. And the Virgin appears and she&rsquo;s like, no problem. Tell me who to kill instead. And she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, anyone, anyone. No, no, no, no. Choose one. How about this Turk? This one has two kids,</p>
<p>a beautiful family waiting for him at home. She&rsquo;s like, no, not this one, choose another one.</p>
<p>And then she goes through all the life stories of the others. She&rsquo;s like, no, no, just don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>anyone. She&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t do that. You can choose to bring your brother back. And he will be</p>
<p>depressed for the rest of his life because he didn&rsquo;t fight at war, because he didn&rsquo;t go to that</p>
<p>battle. And he will live without honor. And in the end, the woman decides to have her brother killed</p>
<p>instead because he dies with her. I mean, this is insane. So why am I giving you these examples?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a glorification of misery. It&rsquo;s expanding your emotional range. It&rsquo;s teaching you that,</p>
<p>and when I read these stories, I&rsquo;m not a jerk. I&rsquo;m crying out loud. I have tears. And my face</p>
<p>becomes red from the pain that I&rsquo;m experiencing through these stories. It&rsquo;s just so deeply</p>
<p>touching to embrace the suffering, not because of an accident, but because of a choice, the sacrifice</p>
<p>to embrace the fact that not everything is cute and rosy and always ending well. And I think that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do a good enough job of teaching our kids that just life sucks and life is unfair sometimes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. And sometimes I read a story to my kids. I read a story every night. And sometimes</p>
<p>the story is horrible. And sometimes the story is good and sort of friendly and happy. And my kids</p>
<p>always ask, what&rsquo;s the moral of the story? And sometimes there&rsquo;s a moral and it&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>you should be good or you should be nice. You should be helping each other, et cetera. And</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;s just no moral. And I tell my kids, you know what? Sometimes just life doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense and it&rsquo;s okay. And you can&rsquo;t comprehend everything. And I think this concept of how do you</p>
<p>deal with the bad days comes from the fact that we&rsquo;re taught, we&rsquo;re brainwashed into thinking that</p>
<p>every day should be a happy day. And we&rsquo;re not ready to cope with misery. And the other thing</p>
<p>that crying through these stories teaches you is that you don&rsquo;t have it nearly half as bad as you</p>
<p>think. Do you see what I mean? Basically, it tells you that, I mean, my mom would always tell me about</p>
<p>how she was transformed as a teenager when she volunteered in the hospital. And she saw all these</p>
<p>people at the brink of death, clinging for life and helping them out to best she could and crying</p>
<p>her heart out when they were dying. And sort of how that taught her the appreciation for what we</p>
<p>have every day. Waking up every morning and saying, my life doesn&rsquo;t suck. My life is not nearly half</p>
<p>as bad as it could be. And sort of embracing the joy that we have of living where we live in the</p>
<p>moment we live. And I&rsquo;m going to go further. If you look at the arc of human life, human existence</p>
<p>through the centuries, there&rsquo;s no better way to be alive than now. I mean, we&rsquo;re complaining about</p>
<p>every single little thing. But life expectancy is at an all time high. Sickness, all time low.</p>
<p>Pornness, misery, all time low. There&rsquo;s no better time to be alive globally across all of human</p>
<p>existence. Number one. Number two, here in Boston, there&rsquo;s no better place to be alive.</p>
<p>If you think about the amalgamation of science, engineering, technology, the ridiculously awesome</p>
<p>people you&rsquo;re bringing every week to your podcast. I mean, this is the ancient Greece of modern</p>
<p>society. But the weather still sucks. No, let me put it this way. The weather gives us a range</p>
<p>of emotion. The full range. The full scenic range. That&rsquo;s such a fascinating thing about human</p>
<p>psychology. I often reread this book. I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with it. It&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Search</p>
<p>for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. And he talks about his living through the Holocaust and the</p>
<p>concentration camps. And even there where there&rsquo;s human misery is at its highest, even there he</p>
<p>discovers these moments by observing the suffering, by accepting the suffering. He observes moments</p>
<p>of true joy of how great his life is relative to others at the camp who have it worse.</p>
<p>Yeah. So it&rsquo;s a dangerous slippery slope to think that way because it&rsquo;s basically being better than</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo;s. And if, you know, if the house next door has a giant car, then you want to get a bigger</p>
<p>car or something like that. It&rsquo;s not comparative misery. I think the way that I see it is slightly</p>
<p>different. It&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s not even thinking about all the worst possible outcomes that could have</p>
<p>happened, but didn&rsquo;t. The example, as you were talking about the concentration camps, the most</p>
<p>horrible, I mean, one of the most horrible moments of human existence, is that the concentration</p>
<p>camps, I was thinking about pictures that I was seeing of kids in Syria in war torn zones. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at these kids. And again, I cried out loud, imagining my own son in the van after a</p>
<p>bomb explosion, watching his father die or his siblings die or losing his friends. It&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that we are not capable of fathoming. But if you actually put a seven year old in that situation,</p>
<p>the look that I saw in these kids eyes basically said, it is what it is. It was, and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced that with my own kid when he gets, like my three year old last, like two years ago,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now my five year old, she was burned really badly with like hot chocolate and coffee that just</p>
<p>peeled off her skin. So you could actually see just her fragile skin had just peeled off.</p>
<p>And she was the happiest little kid. She was just going along with the punches.</p>
<p>It is what it is. She accepted it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite dramatic to sort of realize that children don&rsquo;t say, oh, I could have it better.</p>
<p>They sort of embrace the moment, not embrace, but sort of accept the moment. And then</p>
<p>they can have moments of pure joy in a horrendous war torn country. And like so many people from</p>
<p>these war torn countries basically say, oh, you think you Americans are going to just come and</p>
<p>just send us a bunch of aid and food, et cetera? Yeah, sure. That&rsquo;s helpful. But what do we dream</p>
<p>of? What do we struggle for? We struggle for love. We struggle for meaning. We struggle for,</p>
<p>you know, emotions and friendships. We struggle for the same things you guys struggle for.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just like every day waking up and saying, oh, I wish I had more food.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s just the given. I just don&rsquo;t have enough food. But what we struggle with</p>
<p>are basically everything else. And that sort of gives you some perspective on life. It basically</p>
<p>says, you know, and another story that my mom told me when I was a kid is this story about sort of</p>
<p>this man who&rsquo;s basically, you know, he sees the Christ appear in front of him and he says,</p>
<p>oh, Christ, I&rsquo;m carrying all these problems. I&rsquo;m carrying this big bag. Can you please take it from</p>
<p>me? And he&rsquo;s like, sure. Let me just give you any other bag. And of course the person in Vienna</p>
<p>accepts his own bag. So acceptance, ultimately the path you recommend is acceptance. Every single</p>
<p>other bag is probably worse. It&rsquo;s the evil you don&rsquo;t know versus the evil you know. Like we all</p>
<p>struggle with our own problems. But if you look at the bigger picture, it&rsquo;s just your path through</p>
<p>life. And if you embrace it, the good and the bad, every single day, it&rsquo;s just joy, elation,</p>
<p>sadness, misery. If you don&rsquo;t have both, you&rsquo;re not a complete human being. You know, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, the last example I&rsquo;m going to give is the movie Inside Out by Pixar. Beautiful movie.</p>
<p>Which one is that?</p>
<p>The one with the little characters controlling highly trained. So you basically have joy and</p>
<p>sadness and fear and disgust, et cetera. And the moral of the story, if you remember the movie,</p>
<p>the moral of the story is that in the end, joy is basically trying to fix everything,</p>
<p>to make everything happy. And she&rsquo;s failing miserably and everything else is like crumbling</p>
<p>and falling apart. And the little girl basically becomes emotionless because all she knows how to</p>
<p>do is fake happiness. And I think it&rsquo;s a very good analogy for our everyday society where we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>saying, are you happy? Are you happy? My mom calls me and she&rsquo;s like, Manolis, are you happy? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, mom, stop asking this stupid question. No, I&rsquo;m not happy. What you should be asking is if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fulfilled. And that&rsquo;s a very different thing. I don&rsquo;t go around being happy.</p>
<p>I would love it if your mom called and said, Manolis, are you suffering beautifully or something</p>
<p>like that? That&rsquo;s exactly right. That&rsquo;s what she should be asking. Are you struggling to achieve</p>
<p>something great? That&rsquo;s the question that mom should be asking. Hear that mom call me about</p>
<p>the suffering, not about how good are you doing? So what I tell her is that life is not about</p>
<p>maximizing happiness. Life is about accomplishing something meaningful. And accomplishing that</p>
<p>meaningful thing cannot come from a series of joyful moments. It comes from a series of struggles,</p>
<p>of successes and failures, of people being nasty to you and people being nice to you and embracing</p>
<p>the full thing. And if you supersede that constant need for gratification, if you supersede that</p>
<p>constant need for kindness, you suddenly know who you are. And what I like to say to my kid,</p>
<p>my son the other day was telling me, oh, so and so called me such and such. And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>are you such and such? He&rsquo;s like, no. I&rsquo;m like, ha ha, see, they were wrong. And what I tell him</p>
<p>is if you know who you are, what other people say about you only teaches you about them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it has no influence on your self esteem. If you know where you stand, you embrace the good,</p>
<p>but you also embrace the bad. I have plenty of bad and I&rsquo;m embracing it. I&rsquo;m a procrastinator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a procrastinator. How do I deal with that? I trick myself into procrastinating about mindless,</p>
<p>stupid little day to day things. And in that procrastination time doing important things</p>
<p>for the future. So accepting who you are, accepting your flaws, accepting the whole of it,</p>
<p>accepting the struggle, accepting the sleeplessness, accepting the fact that the journey</p>
<p>matters, hoping that your path to Ithaka is full of troubles because those troubles are the life</p>
<p>you will lead. Accepting that life will not start after the next milestone, that life has already</p>
<p>started a long time ago. And what you&rsquo;re experiencing now is the life. This is it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some kind of future thing that you work yourself hard to get to. And then after that,</p>
<p>you live happily ever after. To me, the happily ever after, that&rsquo;s the end of the story. Nothing</p>
<p>happens after that. The struggle and the struggle and the struggle is much more interesting story</p>
<p>than they lived happily ever after. So I think we have to embrace that as a society that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just about the happy ending, that our kids are brainwashed into expecting that things will</p>
<p>be happy and rosy and it&rsquo;s okay if they&rsquo;re not. And they should keep struggling because the</p>
<p>struggle is the journey and the journey is the meaning of life. It&rsquo;s not the end, it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>journey. What about accepting one of the harder things? We talked a little bit about immortality.</p>
<p>What about accepting that life ends? So do you, Manolis, think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>How, we talked about accepting that there&rsquo;s ups and downs to life. What about the ultimate down,</p>
<p>which is the finality of it? Do you think about that? Do you fear it?</p>
<p>You also asked me if I&rsquo;m afraid of getting older.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s on the path to mortality. So let me talk about that first step and then the last step.</p>
<p>The last step.</p>
<p>Literally the last step. So getting older, what does that mean? When I was 18, when I was 20,</p>
<p>my brain, I felt was at my maximum. I was like, nothing is impossible. I can solve anything.</p>
<p>I could take any math puzzle, any logic puzzle, any programming puzzle and just solve it in</p>
<p>milliseconds. I just saw the answer through problems. I was like feeling invincible.</p>
<p>I would show up at lecture with my newspaper, lift up my head every now and then, point to errors,</p>
<p>just brat, complete brat. I would raise my hand and correct my professor from the whole classroom.</p>
<p>Total brat. I have some of those in my class now and it&rsquo;s awesome. It&rsquo;s like very&hellip;</p>
<p>I used to be you.</p>
<p>It teaches you humility.</p>
<p>So I felt invincible and I was like, this is it. This is awesome. I&rsquo;m living the life.</p>
<p>10 years later, my brain didn&rsquo;t work the same way. I wasn&rsquo;t as good at the tiny little puzzles,</p>
<p>but it worked in different ways. And right now, 20 years later, it works in yet different ways.</p>
<p>And oh gosh, I love the journey.</p>
<p>Can you maybe give some hints of the interesting different ways that your brain works as it aged?</p>
<p>Yeah. I went from the phase of sheer speed and hardcore quantitative thinking to sort of stepping</p>
<p>back, being able to sort of make more connections, being able to sort of say, yeah, but let&rsquo;s use</p>
<p>that thing. Sort of a huge new creativity being unleashed. Basically, when you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of thinking about that one problem. You can sort of reconfigure all the variables</p>
<p>combinatorially in your head and just wipe it all out. When you&rsquo;re just a little older,</p>
<p>you start getting more creative. You start bringing in things from different fields and different</p>
<p>contexts and sort of stepping outside the box. Basically, it&rsquo;s like being in the rat race and</p>
<p>saying, there&rsquo;s a ceiling. Why are we trying to get through that? So it&rsquo;s sort of thinking outside</p>
<p>the box. And then at 40, what I&rsquo;m going through now is this whole sort of embracing the path of</p>
<p>life. And when I say life has started already, it&rsquo;s not a test anymore. This is basically</p>
<p>embracing the finality. Embracing that the journey is what it&rsquo;s at. So what I like to say is live</p>
<p>every day as if it&rsquo;s your last one and make plans as if you&rsquo;ll never die. I always have the long term</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sort of planning out for that will eventually become the short term. And I always have</p>
<p>the sort of short term. And I think this ability to sort of look at life in the past and look at</p>
<p>life in the future jointly and sort of embrace the continuity both of life in the universe and</p>
<p>on our planet, as well as life as a human being from the beginning to the end, just as a path,</p>
<p>as a journey, and just embracing every aspect of that. I mean, I was talking about parenthood the</p>
<p>other day and how amazingly fulfilling it is to sort of relive childhood through the eyes of my</p>
<p>kid, but with the perspective of a parent. So the sheer arrogance of youth watching this in my kid,</p>
<p>I can see myself when I was 18 correcting my professor. I felt so proud. Little did I know that</p>
<p>my professor was working on so much more interesting things than the three little</p>
<p>things he was putting on the board that day. And I was like, I&rsquo;m invincible. But in fact, no,</p>
<p>just a little brat. And basically right now, I sort of can see the sort of journey with a little</p>
<p>more humility. I can sort of look at my own students with their unbelievable abilities,</p>
<p>being able to do things that I&rsquo;m no longer able to do better than I probably was ever able to do.</p>
<p>But yet being able to guide them and shape their thinking and blow their minds with new ideas and</p>
<p>new directions through my perspective. And I know when something is solvable because I&rsquo;ve been there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to even bother. It&rsquo;s not that I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m sure I could if I tried,</p>
<p>but just I&rsquo;m not interested in that anymore. So what I&rsquo;m embracing this journey of aging</p>
<p>is how my brain is changing and how I&rsquo;m constantly trying to figure out the niches,</p>
<p>the evolutionary niches that I&rsquo;m best adapted for, for the tasks that I&rsquo;m best at,</p>
<p>while hiring and recruiting both assistants and research scientists and students and postdocs,</p>
<p>and that will be the best at those tasks. But someone still has to see the big picture.</p>
<p>And I love being in that role. So at the timescale of a human lifespan,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the same thing that the worm did at the evolutionary timescale of Growing Arms,</p>
<p>the specialization, the carp compartmentalization. I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating to think of what</p>
<p>80 year old Manolis would look back at the man that&rsquo;s sitting here today</p>
<p>and laugh at the silliness, at the arrogance.</p>
<p>He finally figured out something.</p>
<p>I was like, no little thing. You didn&rsquo;t figure out anything.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, it seems that if you&rsquo;re introspective about life, it leads to a kind</p>
<p>of acceptance, a deeper and deeper acceptance of the whole of it.</p>
<p>Again, I want to be cautious about acceptance because it almost says that you can&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of embracing the struggle and embracing the journey is the way that I would put it.</p>
<p>So you ultimately feel the journey isn&rsquo;t just something that happens to you.</p>
<p>You shape it. You shape it. Remember how I was saying that Boston is the best place and the</p>
<p>best time to live in right now, in the history of humanity? I&rsquo;m exaggerating a little bit.</p>
<p>But the way that I think about this is that if you look at the whole of cosmos,</p>
<p>where would you rather be if you&rsquo;re just a bunch of molecules, roughly your biomass?</p>
<p>Where would you rather be? Would you rather be a rock on Mars?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably not. Would you rather be in a black hole? Probably not.</p>
<p>Would you rather be in an exploding supernova? Maybe that might be interesting.</p>
<p>But being on Earth is an awesome solar system, an awesome planetary system, an awesome,</p>
<p>you know, place to be in across all of space time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good place to be in as a bunch of molecules.</p>
<p>If you are a bunch of molecules on Earth today, being an animal with, you know, some kind of</p>
<p>awareness of the stuff around you is wonderful. Being a human among all animals is amazing</p>
<p>because you have all this introspection. And being a human who&rsquo;s young, fit, athletic,</p>
<p>smart, et cetera, I mean, you know, you have so much to be happy for.</p>
<p>Beyond that, being surrounded by a bunch of awesome people that you interact with all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel blessed to interact with the people I know, with the friends I have,</p>
<p>the dinners that I have, all of this. Students that I interact with, I&rsquo;m so blessed.</p>
<p>And the last little blip in this awesomeness of local maximum, the last little blip comes from</p>
<p>being kind, being grateful, and being kind. I don&rsquo;t know if you remember that little prayer</p>
<p>that I described last time of, thank you for all the good you&rsquo;ve given me and give me strength</p>
<p>to give unto others with the same love that you&rsquo;ve given to me. And the whole point of that is being</p>
<p>grateful and being kind. What does that do? From a purely egoistic perspective, it makes the people</p>
<p>around you happier. And it takes that little maximum a little bit further.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll be surrounded by happy people, by being kind. That&rsquo;s the purely egoistic view.</p>
<p>And the purely altruistic view, or maybe it&rsquo;s egoistic as well, is that it&rsquo;s just good to give.</p>
<p>It feels good to give. Like basically watching somebody who&rsquo;s touched by what you said, watching</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s like appreciating a rapid response or a generous offer or just random acts of kindness.</p>
<p>It is so fulfilling. So evolutionarily, we were selected for that. There&rsquo;s just such a good feeling</p>
<p>that comes from that. You know, it&rsquo;s fascinating to think you said Boston is the best place,</p>
<p>and talking about kindness, that the very thought that Boston is the best place in the universe</p>
<p>is almost, it&rsquo;s a kind of a gravitational field. Your thought and your very life in itself is a</p>
<p>kind of field that makes that real. Yeah, the self fulfilling prophecy. Yeah. By claiming it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best and thinking it&rsquo;s the best, it becomes the best. And you make others, it&rsquo;s not a force that</p>
<p>just applies to your own cognition. It applies to the others around you. And then suddenly you live</p>
<p>in an even better place. Yeah. And it creates the reality, the actual reality, the social reality,</p>
<p>then it molds the environment. Exactly. One of the coolest things about you, I think, is you represent</p>
<p>the best of MIT, the spirit of MIT. I&rsquo;m so glad that I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be able to talk to</p>
<p>you, because there&rsquo;s a kind of cynicism about academia in parts that I think is undeserved,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s this, MIT, of course, but academic institutions is a sacred place where</p>
<p>ideas can flourish. And just in the same very way that you&rsquo;re talking about is both kindness</p>
<p>and curiosity and that weird thing that happens when a bunch of curious descendants of apes get</p>
<p>together and just get excited in this ripple effect that happens. I mean, that&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>beautiful aspect of MIT. People might think competition and grants and position, like you</p>
<p>said, the rat race, but underneath it all is these curious human beings inspiring younger human</p>
<p>beings. And there&rsquo;s this ripple effect that happens. And I&rsquo;m so glad that, I mean, I&rsquo;m glad that I get</p>
<p>a chance to record this because it inspires so many other students and so many other people to</p>
<p>do the same, to embrace the inner curious creature that it&rsquo;s not about the race. So let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>the negatives. Let&rsquo;s talk about, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;m serious. You have to embrace the good</p>
<p>and the bad. So let&rsquo;s talk about the negative. Let&rsquo;s address it. So why do people want positions</p>
<p>of power? Why do people want more money, more power, more this, more that? Remember the part</p>
<p>where I was saying, if you know who you are, what other people think about you, it makes no</p>
<p>difference to you. It only teaches you about them. Many people feel defunct about what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and define themselves. They feel instantiated through the eyes of others. So being in a position</p>
<p>of power makes them feel better about themselves. Who knows what other kind of struggles they might</p>
<p>have that creates that need to feel better about themselves. But they have a bunch of struggles and</p>
<p>everybody has a bunch of struggles. And every time I see somebody behaving poorly, I&rsquo;m basically</p>
<p>thinking, well, they&rsquo;re in a tough spot right now. And it&rsquo;s okay. I can kind of see how I would</p>
<p>behave badly in other circumstances as well. So I think if you take away that sort of having to</p>
<p>prove yourself in the eyes of others, life becomes so much easier. So when I first became a professor</p>
<p>at MIT, I started wearing adult clothes. It became a serious person, quote, unquote.</p>
<p>I basically had, I would always go around in my rollerblades and my shorts and a t shirt,</p>
<p>and eventually I was a professional. I bought all these khaki pants and these nice</p>
<p>shirts with, what do they call it, the patterns. And I was dressing with my nice belt every day,</p>
<p>showing up. And then a few months later, I was like, I can&rsquo;t stand it. And I just went back to</p>
<p>my rollerblades and my t shirts and my shorts. And it was this struggle of sort of not feeling that</p>
<p>I fit in. I was so intimidated by all of my colleagues, just watching their incredible</p>
<p>achievements. The person&rsquo;s next to me and the person on the floor below me, I was like, oh my</p>
<p>God, they clearly made a mistake. What the heck am I doing here? How will I ever live up to these</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s standards? And eventually you grow up to realize that the way that I grew up to realize</p>
<p>that the way that other people perceived my work was very similar to the way that I perceived</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s work as flawless. I knew all of the flaws in my work. I knew the limitations. I knew</p>
<p>what I hadn&rsquo;t managed to achieve. And what I saw was maybe a third of the way of what I was trying</p>
<p>to achieve. And I saw everything as flawed. What they saw, what I had achieved, they didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>what I hadn&rsquo;t achieved. They only saw the one third down, which was pretty good in their eyes.</p>
<p>So they all respected me and I was feeling miserable about myself. I was like, I&rsquo;m not worthy.</p>
<p>And I think that this is a cognitive problem that we have. We kind of, it&rsquo;s kind of like when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about artificial general intelligence, AGI, of sort of, we kind of have this definition</p>
<p>that anything that machines can do is not intelligent and anything that they can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>is intelligent. Therefore, we narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow the field of what intelligence</p>
<p>truly means. And as soon as machines achieve self, I mean, it&rsquo;s not intelligent anymore.</p>
<p>I feel like I was doing the same thing with myself. As soon as I could solve something,</p>
<p>it was the kind of thing that a kid like me could solve. And therefore it was kind of easy.</p>
<p>But to the others, it seemed hard. But to me, it seemed easy. So it was this kind of thing that</p>
<p>everything that my colleagues were doing seemed impossible to me. But everything that I was doing</p>
<p>seemed impossible to them. So it was that realization that sort of made me mature into</p>
<p>sort of a, not more confident, but more comfortable human being.</p>
<p>Can you actually linger on that a little bit? I mean, you mentioned Minsky. I remember he said</p>
<p>something in an interview where he said the secret to his, like the way he approached life was</p>
<p>to never be happy with anything he did. So there&rsquo;s something powerful as a motivator</p>
<p>to doing exactly what you&rsquo;re saying, which is everything you&rsquo;ve achieved to see that as easy</p>
<p>and unimpressive. What do you do with that? Because clearly that&rsquo;s a useful thing.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve kind of matured past that. And I think the maturity past that is to sort of accept</p>
<p>what it is and accept that it has helped others build onto it and therefore advance human knowledge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy to sort of fall into the trap of, oh, everything I&rsquo;ve done is crap.</p>
<p>What I told you last time is that I always tell my students that our best work is ahead of us.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s more of my mindset. That&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>Exactly. What we&rsquo;ve done is strong. It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s great for the time. And it&rsquo;ll become obsolete</p>
<p>in 30 years. Not we can, we are doing even better. Exactly. So basically our next work</p>
<p>will just strive. And again, you can&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</p>
<p>At some point you have to wrap. I was having a meeting with my student yesterday and it was like,</p>
<p>listen, we know this is not perfect, but it&rsquo;s way better than anything that&rsquo;s ever been done before.</p>
<p>You know how to improve it. But if you try to, your paper is never going to get published.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this balance of we&rsquo;re already at the top of the field, get it out. And then you work</p>
<p>on the next improvement. And in my experience, this has never happened. We&rsquo;ve never actually</p>
<p>worked on the next improvement. And that&rsquo;s okay. It didn&rsquo;t make a difference because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically putting a new stepping stone that others will be able to step on and surpass you.</p>
<p>My advisor in grad school would basically tell me, Manolis, let others write the second paper</p>
<p>in that field. Just write the first one, move on, move on to the next field. You don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>writing the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth paper in the same field. Just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very shocking to a student to hear that. Cause I was like, I was at the top of my game.</p>
<p>I was owning that field. I was doing it. I was doing it. I was doing it. I was doing it.</p>
<p>Owning that field. And I published the first paper. I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m ready for two and three</p>
<p>and four. He&rsquo;s like, move on. Just let it be. And I was like, Whoa. And it&rsquo;s so liberating</p>
<p>to sort of not have to surpass everyone, but just put your little stepping stone out there</p>
<p>and others will step on it and put their own stones further and eventually cross a bigger</p>
<p>river than if you try to sort of make a giant leap all at once. So you need both.</p>
<p>SL. Beautifully put. So the funny thing is I&rsquo;ve, I believe I closed the previous episode</p>
<p>with a Darwin quote about the power of poetry and music and life.</p>
<p>SL. I think your quote, and again, I only heard it once, was Darwin basically saying,</p>
<p>if I were to live life again, next time I would read more poetry and something about art every</p>
<p>week or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s so interesting for somebody who studied life</p>
<p>at a very cold, I would say, genetic level to say that, yeah, the highest form of living</p>
<p>is the art. But like on that, which made me realize that you write poetry and I</p>
<p>forced you or maybe convinced you somehow to maybe share if it&rsquo;s possible, if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>some of the poetry you&rsquo;ve written yourself in your life.</p>
<p>SL. So again, being Greek, a lot of my poems have been pretty miserable.</p>
<p>And I always like to say that it&rsquo;s very hard for me to write a poem when I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>And I just have to be in a state of deep despair in order to write poems. But the first poem I ever</p>
<p>wrote was in English class. I was, I&rsquo;m Greek, I grew up in Greece, but I was in a French high</p>
<p>school and I was taking English as a foreign language. So the English teacher basically</p>
<p>asked us to write a poem in English. So this is basically what I&rsquo;m going to embarrass myself and</p>
<p>read from my 16 year old self many, many years ago.</p>
<p>SL. Can you give a little bit more context about who you were in this moment? So like just&hellip;</p>
<p>SL. So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really interesting. In terms of growing up, how do we grow up?</p>
<p>SL. It&rsquo;s very difficult to grow up if you&rsquo;re in the same school, going from one class to the other,</p>
<p>and all your friends know you inside out. It&rsquo;s very difficult to change. It&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>grow up because they have a certain set of expectations for who you are and for how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to behave. So in many ways we kind of tend to get set in our ways and not change very much.</p>
<p>I think something that helped me grow up is that when I was 11 years old, I was a</p>
<p>kid in Greece in primary school. When I was 12 years old, I was a kid in Greece in a first year</p>
<p>of high school. When I was 13, I was in France, so basically moved countries and schools. The next</p>
<p>year, I moved schools again because it was a transition in the French educational system</p>
<p>from one school to the next. The next year after that, my family moved to New York in a French high</p>
<p>school there, and the next year after that, I&rsquo;m moving to MIT. So basically between 11 and 19,</p>
<p>every single year, I actually had the opportunity to grow. I was not held by people who knew me,</p>
<p>and I could reinvent myself or reshape myself or reshape my personality, my emotions, as I was</p>
<p>growing up, especially in such a transformative time of a kid&rsquo;s life from 11 to 17. I was</p>
<p>11 to 17. Okay, first of all, it&rsquo;s so powerful that you think of it that way. Did you think of</p>
<p>it that way at the moment? Because it&rsquo;s kind of a source. You said an opportunity to grow,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of suffering. I mean, you&rsquo;re being torn away from the thing you know into a thing</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know. So when we moved from South France to New York, I was pissed. I was pissed. I was</p>
<p>taking these long bike rides in the countryside, jumping in French swimming pools, and I had all</p>
<p>these wonderful friendships, going downtown and just staying by the fountains in the dim lit</p>
<p>streets of Aix en Provence in the South of France. It was magical. And suddenly, I moved to New York</p>
<p>City, a city of cement, of ugliness, like trash in the streets at every corner. It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>Snow everywhere. Having never seen snow or like real snow in my life, I moved from Athens to South</p>
<p>France to suddenly New York. So I was pissed. But whether I saw it as an opportunity for growth,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think that I was that self reflective. It was just how it happened.</p>
<p>Only now do you see it this way.</p>
<p>I saw it like that probably pretty early on, but not during those transitions. So basically,</p>
<p>during those transitions, I was just a kid being a kid. And maybe the time that I started seeing it</p>
<p>that way was maybe when I decided to stay at MIT as a professor after having been there as a student.</p>
<p>And I kind of saw the struggle of getting professors to not see you as a kid when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>your peers. And I was very flattered when one of my friends basically told me, oh, I remember you</p>
<p>in recitation when you first asked me a question. I said, wow, this kid. I&rsquo;ll pay attention.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;ll be a peer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, certainly my perception was that many of them could not see me as anything</p>
<p>but a kid. But it turns out that some of them saw me as something different than a kid even</p>
<p>before I was actually their colleague. So it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting place because</p>
<p>what I like to say about MIT is that people treat you as equal no matter what stage.</p>
<p>And they respect you for what you say, not for who you are when you&rsquo;re saying it.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m wrong, my students will tell me. They will have no reservation to just be bluntly,</p>
<p>you know, sorry. I don&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, the beautiful thing about you, sorry to put it this way, is, you know,</p>
<p>maybe people who weren&rsquo;t familiar with your work beforehand might think, like,</p>
<p>might not realize that you&rsquo;re a world class scientist who leads a large group and so on.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a youthful nature to you that it&rsquo;s, I mean, you talk like a first,</p>
<p>like an undergrad, you know, with the excitement and the fresh eyes and the sort of excitement</p>
<p>about the world. And that&rsquo;s, first of all, super contagious and beautiful. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to sort of fall into behaving seriously because then people kind of start putting</p>
<p>you on a pedestal more into a position of power. You want to sort of act like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a position of power as opposed to allowing yourself to be lost in the just the curiosity,</p>
<p>the childish view of the world, which is just this open eyed love of knowledge.</p>
<p>And that was the transition that I was describing when I decided to go back to my rollerblades</p>
<p>and t shirt and baseball cap. Basically, you know, when I met my first postdoc,</p>
<p>it was basically, you know, he was interviewing for postdocs at MIT. He already had several</p>
<p>first author papers to his name in top journals. And my friend Yulia basically introduced me to</p>
<p>Alex Stark, who basically was interviewing at the time with Rick Young and with Eric Lander,</p>
<p>just like these massive names in the field. And I was just a first year faculty person with,</p>
<p>you know, zero credibility. And she basically says, Oh, there&rsquo;s this friend of mine, Alex,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s visiting. He&rsquo;s also German. You know, he wanted to meet you. I&rsquo;m like, Oh, sounds great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk science. I show up. We sit at the amphitheater in Stata. You know, I basically</p>
<p>arrive in my rollerblades, you know, jump a few steps, sit down wearing my blades. We&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>this awesome conversation about science and about gene regulation and how the whole thing works and</p>
<p>sort of, you know, my perspective and his perspective. We&rsquo;re just bouncing ideas for 30</p>
<p>minutes. And then I just dash off to my next meeting. And he basically emails me afterwards.</p>
<p>And I was giving him advice about how to interview with Eric Lander, how to interview with Rick Young</p>
<p>and how to sort of get a position with them. And then after a while, he emails me saying,</p>
<p>I would love to become a postdoc in your group. I&rsquo;m like, what are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Like, so, so he basically didn&rsquo;t care that I wear rollerblades and T shirt. All he cared</p>
<p>about was my ideas and sort of embracing the me with the childhood excitement about science</p>
<p>was basically what attracted him. It wasn&rsquo;t the, wow, this guy runs a big lab or this and that.</p>
<p>He was just like, I like his ideas. I want to work with him. That, by the way, folks is the best of</p>
<p>MIT. That&rsquo;s what MIT stands for. So that&rsquo;s a beautiful story. But take me back to the poem</p>
<p>and where did this poem come from? Where&rsquo;s your mindset? So who is the 17, 16 year old kid Manolis?</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;ve just seen snow for the first time and I&rsquo;m in New York. So I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s where the sadness in the poem comes from. But anyway, we&rsquo;re asked in class to write</p>
<p>an assignment. This is my third language. I&rsquo;m not very good at it. So pardon me, but here&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>wrote. Children dance now all in row, children laughing at the snow. But in time&rsquo;s endless flow,</p>
<p>children sooner or later grow. Men are mortal. We go by. If we know it, we may cry. But I thought</p>
<p>a love so sweet was immortal, was so deep. There I told you, darling sweet, that forever love would</p>
<p>keep. Blossomed spring and summer shined. Then blue autumn, winter died. One year passed, but the</p>
<p>clouds still remember all our vows. Never faked and never lied. All we did was stare and smile.</p>
<p>All alone, sitting down, to the snow we made our vow. But you told me you were right. Birds who</p>
<p>love are birds who cry. Now with laughter children play, yet the sky is so gray. Even if the snow</p>
<p>seems bright, without you have lost their light. Sun that sang and moon that smiled, all the stars</p>
<p>have ceased to shine. All of nature drew its grace, found its light within your face. Now you&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t return. Let the snow in my heart burn. There&rsquo;s a Greek in there. That&rsquo;s beautiful. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful, by the way. And the rhyming, the musicality, there&rsquo;s both a simplicity and a</p>
<p>musicality to it. I&rsquo;m 16. It&rsquo;s my third language. No, no, no. So I really enjoy like Robert Frost</p>
<p>poems. I don&rsquo;t mean simplicity in a bad way, in a negative way at all. Again, it&rsquo;s very weird to</p>
<p>analyze your own poem, but I think it captures the simplicity of youth and the way that it kind of</p>
<p>starts with Children Dance Like Only Low. It basically, and it kind of shows that snow can be</p>
<p>interpreted first in the first verse as a happy thing, ta da da da da snow. And then in the end,</p>
<p>you know, now with laughter children play, I&rsquo;m like, now I&rsquo;ve grown basically. It&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>transformation that we&rsquo;re actually talking about, this whole men are mortal, we go by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of, you know, you&rsquo;re saying, are you comfortable with growing old? I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>duh. I was, I was since I was 16. And what&rsquo;s really interesting is that, you know, again,</p>
<p>when I was 12 years old in our summer house in Greece, I remember sort of telling my sister</p>
<p>my outlook that I would have as a father for how to bring up my own kids. So it&rsquo;s very weird that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always sort of seen the full path from, you know, a kid. From when you were young. Yeah. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you like this Joni Mitchell song. I&rsquo;ve looked at clouds from both sides now,</p>
<p>from up and down and still somehow it snows illusions I recall. It&rsquo;s clouds illusions I</p>
<p>recall. I really don&rsquo;t know clouds at all. So it&rsquo;s really beautiful. So I think the Joni Mitchell</p>
<p>song, which again, I heard for the first time much, much after this, and I wouldn&rsquo;t even compare</p>
<p>this to that. But what Joni Mitchell is saying that song is that you can see life from two</p>
<p>perspectives. You can see the good or the bad in both, you know, in everything you see. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the allegory of snow right now. You can see snow as this bright, white, wonderful thing,</p>
<p>or you can see snow as this miserable, you know, gray thing. So that&rsquo;s sort of, and what I like</p>
<p>about the last verse now with laughter children play is that it&rsquo;s a recall to the first one</p>
<p>where I was the kid enjoying careless life, and eventually was making promises that something</p>
<p>would be forever. And I think part of that is also the loss of my friendships in France,</p>
<p>of being in New York now and sort of everything&rsquo;s gray. And, you know, even though the snow seems</p>
<p>bright, without you have lost their light, sun that sang and moon that smiled. So it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>concept that if you lose your love, the same thing can be perceived in a very different way.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, because somebody wrote me this long email,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re the perfect person to ask this. You mentioned love.</p>
<p>From a genetic perspective, what is it? What do you make of love? Why do we humans fall in love?</p>
<p>In your own life, why did you fall in love? You know, the email that was written to me was,</p>
<p>you always talk about mortality and fear of mortality, but you don&rsquo;t ask about love. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s some thoughts you could give about the role of love in your own life,</p>
<p>or the role of love in human life in general. I think love in many ways defines my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, I like to say that I&rsquo;m a human first and a professor second. And I think this</p>
<p>passion for life, this passion for, you know, everything around us. I mean, the only way to</p>
<p>describe that is love. It&rsquo;s basically, you know, embracing your, you know, emotional self,</p>
<p>embracing the, you know, the non brainiac in you, embracing the sort of intangible, the</p>
<p>not very well defined. And even in my own research, I&rsquo;m just very passionate about</p>
<p>everything I do. You know, there&rsquo;s a certain passion that comes through. And what, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>again, being Greek, the etymology of the word passion. What was passion? Passion is suffering.</p>
<p>The etymology, when we talk about the passion of the Christ, it&rsquo;s a suffering.</p>
<p>And in the Greek version of that word, pathos, like pathology, pathos is deep suffering. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the concept of someone who&rsquo;s sympathetic. Sympathetic means suffering together,</p>
<p>experiencing emotions together. So it&rsquo;s funny that you ask me about love and I respond with passion,</p>
<p>passion for life, passion for research, passion for my family, for my children, for, you know.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain passion that defines me and everything else follows rather than the other way</p>
<p>around. I&rsquo;m not first thinking with my brain, what is the most impactful paper we could write? And</p>
<p>then going after that, I&rsquo;m thinking with my heart, what am I passionate about? What drives me? What</p>
<p>just like, you know, makes me take. And that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to live, but I love it how the Greek</p>
<p>part of you just kind of connects it to the suffering. So if you could remove the suffering.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no. When I say suffering, I don&rsquo;t mean suffering as in being miserable. I mean</p>
<p>suffering as in being emotionally invested in something. Remember, I mean, again, if you look</p>
<p>at this poem, what is it saying? It&rsquo;s saying birds who love are birds who cry. Right? That&rsquo;s the very</p>
<p>definition of love. Exposing your fragility. If you&rsquo;re not afraid of suffering, you don&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>in love. As soon as you hold back, you protect, you shield your heart, no love can enter. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this Simon and Garfunkel song. I am a rock. I am an island. And a rock feels no pain. And an island</p>
<p>never cries. So again, there&rsquo;s some aspect of that into this poem. The fact that, you know,</p>
<p>but you told me, you know, there I told you, darling sweet, that forever love would keep,</p>
<p>is this intermediate thing. And then there&rsquo;s a recall, but you told me you were right. Birds</p>
<p>who love are birds who cry. So it basically says that love is the fragility that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to give to another person. It&rsquo;s opening up your vulnerable spots. It&rsquo;s sort of accepting</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no safety net. You&rsquo;re just giving yourself fully and you&rsquo;re ready to be hurt.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve already been way too kind with your time, but I&rsquo;m going to force you to stay here</p>
<p>just a few minutes longer as we&rsquo;re talking about goodbyes. You have a really nice other poem here</p>
<p>about goodbyes. Can I force you to read it as well? Oh, twist my arm, twist my arm. So the next</p>
<p>poem was written specifically for our high school yearbook. So another poem written on demand,</p>
<p>the rest of them are just so miserable, written by pure, you know, sadness and melancholy.</p>
<p>But this one was also written on demand and it was basically saying goodbye, as is appropriate</p>
<p>right now, to my friends and sort of, again, reflecting this whole journey and transformation</p>
<p>through life. And also I think showing a little bit of introspection about how we kind of had it</p>
<p>easy in high school and we&rsquo;re about to go into rougher waters. So the title is actually The Tide</p>
<p>Waters and it&rsquo;s an analogy on that. So here it goes. All this was another lake, where some rest</p>
<p>we sailors take, waters calm and full of fish, we&rsquo;ll find there what we wish, some seek fruit</p>
<p>and others feast, some of us just look for peace, some find fresh ships, other love, some seek both</p>
<p>and neither have. We were different when we came, each his own story and fame, different people had</p>
<p>we been, different cultures had we seen, different nature, different face, each unlike all in this</p>
<p>place. We had faced success, defeat, then in one lake came to meet. There, the orders that we</p>
<p>followed and the pride that we swallowed, made us one but not the same, joined us strangers who</p>
<p>there came. Sooner later, groups were made, tribes where differences will fade, some attached more</p>
<p>or less, others fought and made a mess. But again we have to go, what for, where to, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>still we know it, we will try, there to rush, to flee, to fly. There&rsquo;ll be some who wish to stay</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll carry on away, we&rsquo;ll continue on our journey as we came here, strong yet lonely.</p>
<p>From the lake a river flows, from the river many goals, on that river we will race, each will try</p>
<p>to find his pace, in that scene the sailors face, their first fear, defeat, disgrace,</p>
<p>defeat, disgrace, here and there comes out a face that the waters soon embrace. Some get lucky,</p>
<p>find their way, others sink beneath the waves, in this race we will part, some will settle near the</p>
<p>start, some set goals beyond the stars because the river carries far. You should know in what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done, the hard part is still to come. So I&rsquo;ll have to say goodbye, don&rsquo;t you worry, I won&rsquo;t cry,</p>
<p>neither will they those who try, till the end, to keep their pride. But please know dearest friends</p>
<p>who are always there to mend, I will always need your hand, I will miss you till the end.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it. Manolis, like I said last time, you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>the most special people at MIT, one of the most special people in Boston, and whatever mental</p>
<p>force field that you&rsquo;re applying in saying that Boston is the best city in the world,</p>
<p>MIT the best university in the world, you&rsquo;re actually making it happen. So thank you so much</p>
