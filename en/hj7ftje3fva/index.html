about getting a second opinion whether it&amp;rsquo;s for some type of medical condition or whatever an effective treatment solution to a medical problem should not give you another health problem there are always risks involved or side effects so you really want to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting the correct solution to your problem so getting a second or third or fourth opinion is really just expanding the amount of data that you have so you can evaluate more effectively now there&amp;rsquo;s two things i want to mention when you evaluate you have to have good data you can&amp;rsquo;t have false data you also have to have all the data to evaluate you can&amp;rsquo;t have missing data and i want to relate this to a recent situation that i ran into with a friend who had this condition called spondylolisthesis which is a a fracture in the lower back a lot of people actually have this condition where the vertebra like the lumbar vertebra should be aligned but what&amp;rsquo;s happening it&amp;rsquo;s shifted forward because the back part is fractured so then the spinal cord can pinch in the back part it&amp;rsquo;s called spondylolisthesis and so um he got it from a an old injury he fell on his tailbone and apparently created a fracture didn&amp;rsquo;t know it then later in life he had back pain he didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it was he had an x-ray and sure enough he had this condition um you have to realize that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ligaments and tendons and muscles that hold that in place and so there are certain levels or grades of having this condition from from grade one to three or four when it gets really really severe and so anyway he had this condition he went to the doctor and uh he wanted a second opinion from me i looked at his x-rays it was a grade one it was not majorly severe and he had some mild symptoms and he was going to physical therapy and the doctor said you better get the surgery or you&amp;rsquo;re going to be a cripple he said the surgery is totally safe and the physical therapy is not really long lasting so that was the data he had to evaluate and so when you evaluate you need to have all the information available and the problem is with you doing research you might google it but you might not find it in the first five pages you have to dig deep because sometimes this data is buried but here are some of the missing data that i told him number one um just from experience working with you know tens of thousands of people i&amp;rsquo;ve ran into quite a few people with this condition and there are certain exercises that can majorly help this condition which by the way i will do a separate video on and these exercises can stabilize that condition to the point where the person could literally be without pain now it is true that the complications from surgery is rare however there are other things that could definitely increase the risk of getting these complications number one if you&amp;rsquo;re a smoker well guess what he&amp;rsquo;s a chain smoker number two if you have arthritis well guess what he has massive arthritis through this entire spine so the risk of some of these complications are definitely higher now the other piece of information that i gave him so he can correctly evaluate what the doctor told him as far as success level well in my book doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be that successful or effective but when you actually look at the studies it was 73% successful so what does that mean you have a 73 percent of having a successful surgery what about the other percentage what happens with that is there permanent damage what type of side effects is it really going to be safe enough not to give you another problem could there be any accident where the person is permanently paralyzed that was the question i want to know and that potentially could happen too so a 73 success rate especially when he&amp;rsquo;s getting therapy and he&amp;rsquo;s almost pain-free just does not make sense i also told him this anytime a doctor is using fear to motivate you that&amp;rsquo;s not a good motivating factor you should just give that patient all the data so they can truly evaluate based on true information and having all of the data there now i want to mention one more point when you evaluate something sometimes the patient is invalidated or made wrong for looking at another viewpoint or another opinion i think that&amp;rsquo;s definitely not okay as well so let&amp;rsquo;s say they want to look at alternative care or nutrition or different diet that is sometimes invalidated as something that&amp;rsquo;s quackery or it has no scientific basis or the science is settled and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t look at that or even consider that and i say that because when you start to really look at research and how much corruption there is i mean it&amp;rsquo;s incredible the problem is most people cannot comprehend the research and so they&amp;rsquo;re always getting second hand information by getting some interpretation or an opinion from the actual research because i mean when i even read certain research on keto for example and you find out the research was an observational study based on a questionnaire or that the so-called ketogenic diet really wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ketogenic diet it was actually a high carb diet with high fat so you really have to have all the data make sure it&amp;rsquo;s factual make sure that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing missing in order to make the best decision all right thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today"><title>Why Get a Second Opinion？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

whether it&rsquo;s for some type of medical condition  </p><p>or whatever an effective treatment solution 
to a medical problem should not give you  </p><p>another health problem there are always 
risks involved or side effects so you  </p><p>really want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the 
correct solution to your problem so getting  </p><p>a second or third or fourth opinion is really 
just expanding the amount of data that you have  </p><p>so you can evaluate more effectively 
now there&rsquo;s two things i want to mention  </p><p>when you evaluate you have to have good data you 
can&rsquo;t have false data you also have to have all  </p><p>the data to evaluate you can&rsquo;t have missing 
data and i want to relate this to a recent  </p><p>situation that i ran into with a friend who had 
this condition called spondylolisthesis which is a  </p><p>a fracture in the lower back a lot of 
people actually have this condition  </p><p>where the vertebra like the lumbar vertebra 
should be aligned but what&rsquo;s happening it&rsquo;s  </p><p>shifted forward because the back part is 
fractured so then the spinal cord can pinch in the  </p><p>back part it&rsquo;s called spondylolisthesis and so 
um he got it from a an old injury he fell on  </p><p>his tailbone and apparently created a fracture 
didn&rsquo;t know it then later in life he had back  </p><p>pain he didn&rsquo;t know what it was he had an x-ray 
and sure enough he had this condition um you  </p><p>have to realize that there&rsquo;s a lot of ligaments 
and tendons and muscles that hold that in place  </p><p>and so there are certain levels or grades of 
having this condition from from grade one to three  </p><p>or four when it gets really really severe and so 
anyway he had this condition he went to the doctor  </p><p>and uh he wanted a second opinion from me 
i looked at his x-rays it was a grade one  </p><p>it was not majorly severe and he had some mild 
symptoms and he was going to physical therapy  </p><p>and the doctor said you better get the surgery or 
you&rsquo;re going to be a cripple he said the surgery  </p><p>is totally safe and the physical therapy is 
not really long lasting so that was the data  </p><p>he had to evaluate and so when you evaluate you 
need to have all the information available and  </p><p>the problem is with you doing research you might 
google it but you might not find it in the first  </p><p>five pages you have to dig deep because 
sometimes this data is buried but here  </p><p>are some of the missing data that i told him 
number one um just from experience working with  </p><p>you know tens of thousands of people i&rsquo;ve ran into 
quite a few people with this condition and there  </p><p>are certain exercises that can majorly help this 
condition which by the way i will do a separate  </p><p>video on and these exercises can stabilize that 
condition to the point where the person could  </p><p>literally be without pain now it is true that 
the complications from surgery is rare however  </p><p>there are other things that could definitely 
increase the risk of getting these complications  </p><p>number one if you&rsquo;re a smoker well guess what he&rsquo;s 
a chain smoker number two if you have arthritis  </p><p>well guess what he has massive arthritis through 
this entire spine so the risk of some of these  </p><p>complications are definitely higher now the other 
piece of information that i gave him so he can  </p><p>correctly evaluate what the doctor told him as 
far as success level well in my book doesn&rsquo;t  </p><p>seem to be that successful or effective 
but when you actually look at the studies  </p><p>it was 73% successful so what does that mean you 
have a 73 percent of having a successful surgery  </p><p>what about the other percentage what 
happens with that is there permanent damage  </p><p>what type of side effects is it really going to 
be safe enough not to give you another problem  </p><p>could there be any accident 
where the person is permanently  </p><p>paralyzed that was the question i want to know 
and that potentially could happen too so a 73  </p><p>success rate especially when he&rsquo;s getting therapy 
and he&rsquo;s almost pain-free just does not make  </p><p>sense i also told him this anytime a doctor is 
using fear to motivate you that&rsquo;s not a good  </p><p>motivating factor you should just give that 
patient all the data so they can truly evaluate  </p><p>based on true information and having all of 
the data there now i want to mention one more  </p><p>point when you evaluate something sometimes the 
patient is invalidated or made wrong for looking  </p><p>at another viewpoint or another opinion i think 
that&rsquo;s definitely not okay as well so let&rsquo;s say  </p><p>they want to look at alternative care or nutrition 
or different diet that is sometimes invalidated as  </p><p>something that&rsquo;s quackery or it has no scientific 
basis or the science is settled and you shouldn&rsquo;t  </p><p>look at that or even consider that and i say 
that because when you start to really look at  </p><p>research and how much corruption there is i 
mean it&rsquo;s incredible the problem is most people  </p><p>cannot comprehend the research and so they&rsquo;re 
always getting second hand information by getting  </p><p>some interpretation or an opinion from the actual 
research because i mean when i even read certain  </p><p>research on keto for example and you find out the 
research was an observational study based on a  </p><p>questionnaire or that the so-called ketogenic diet 
really wasn&rsquo;t a ketogenic diet it was actually a  </p><p>high carb diet with high fat so you really have 
to have all the data make sure it&rsquo;s factual  </p><p>make sure that there&rsquo;s nothing missing in order 
to make the best decision all right thanks for  </p><p>watching hey before you go real quick i have a 
course entitled how to bulletproof your immune  </p><p>system it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it 
and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment  </p><p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p><p>what about strengthening your immune system 
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p><p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p><p>by strengthening your own immune system i put 
a link down in the description right down below  </p><p>check it out and get signed up today</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
