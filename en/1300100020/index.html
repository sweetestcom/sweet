<p>me and charlie murphy and john heffron</p>
<p>and we would</p>
<p>travel across</p>
<p>the country we did like 20 different stops</p>
<p>and we we used</p>
<p>local guys like</p>
<p>every every</p>
<p>place we went to we had a</p>
<p>local comic</p>
<p>would go up and perform</p>
<p>and tommy was the funniest of all of them</p>
<p>he was really</p>
<p>i was really</p>
<p>shocked like</p>
<p>every now and then you see a comedian</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncomfortable say this way</p>
<p>right here but</p>
<p>every now and then you see a comedian</p>
<p>you know and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know this guy was around how&rsquo;s he fucking so funny</p>
<p>you know most the time like</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny like you know</p>
<p>you know who they are</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying yeah you hear</p>
<p>about them already yeah oh totally yeah i appreciate</p>
<p>you hear that echo that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>other computer</p>
<p>in the background but</p>
<p>yeah i know i when you</p>
<p>travel and you see people and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>hey where do you go up cause i&rsquo;ve never seen you</p>
<p>especially when they live</p>
<p>funny yeah but it&rsquo;s so rare when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like most</p>
<p>comics like if you say like</p>
<p>comics that you don&rsquo;t know what percentage of them</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t make you laugh</p>
<p>percentage of comics don&rsquo;t make me laugh yeah oh</p>
<p>well up into like the 85th</p>
<p>percentile it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing and i understand that comedy is different</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>some people like that i don&rsquo;t like or i like</p>
<p>that some people don&rsquo;t like you know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>infantile ridiculous</p>
<p>silly comedy</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t turn up the</p>
<p>microphone all the way it says i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know i think it&rsquo;s on as loud as it can go</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen hold on a second</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some sort of an input</p>
<p>is it really that low</p>
<p>is that any better</p>
<p>know i need to project</p>
<p>this i hope we don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re not in some</p>
<p>weird thing here it&rsquo;s on the blue snowball right</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>sorry is it really that low ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>turn the microphone up a bit i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i can i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything i can do</p>
<p>other than where it&rsquo;s at right now</p>
<p>some people say it</p>
<p>sounds fine some people says it&rsquo;s pretty quiet</p>
<p>well do you have a volume on your motherfucking phone</p>
<p>or whatever you&rsquo;re watching this on</p>
<p>because work that shit yo</p>
<p>um what happened</p>
<p>we have a little issue here a technological issue</p>
<p>lost the screen</p>
<p>yeah on with the show indeed</p>
<p>as this man said</p>
<p>we were just too far</p>
<p>all right well we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right up to it right now anyway</p>
<p>the percentage of</p>
<p>comics that suck i</p>
<p>would have to say it&rsquo;s probably like 80</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably like 80</p>
<p>even that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>discounting for there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of people that i know are good they&rsquo;re just not my</p>
<p>style i totally</p>
<p>accept that and</p>
<p>appreciate that</p>
<p>but like when</p>
<p>you go on the road and you see someone and you know you</p>
<p>never heard</p>
<p>about this guy before</p>
<p>and you see him and they&rsquo;re hilarious you&rsquo;re like whoa</p>
<p>how fun is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking awesome</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing yeah because even like</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;ll kind of like</p>
<p>enjoy somebody you can go like</p>
<p>oh that was a well written joke</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good joke</p>
<p>structure or something but like</p>
<p>when you actually</p>
<p>turn up like</p>
<p>laughing like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>grabbing your gut and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious that&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rare it&rsquo;s like you just</p>
<p>found a gift</p>
<p>you know cause it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>especially as comedians like</p>
<p>you see everything coming or you see a lot of</p>
<p>things coming rather</p>
<p>and like when you run into someone who&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny like it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out there i know they&rsquo;re out there yeah</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>so many guys that fucking suck and what they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is just nonsense</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>stupidity and you know that they&rsquo;re not even really</p>
<p>thinking about what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not anything that they&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>come to some</p>
<p>weird conclusion it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>bunch of nonsense</p>
<p>designed to make you</p>
<p>laugh and that</p>
<p>shit is hard to deal with over and over and over</p>
<p>again it makes you</p>
<p>lose faith in it</p>
<p>and you wonder</p>
<p>for comics like shit</p>
<p>what is it like</p>
<p>coming up in this day</p>
<p>but when i was coming up</p>
<p>there was a lot more comedy clubs a lot more</p>
<p>different comedians</p>
<p>to look at there was a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on a lot of action</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s way less action now</p>
<p>oh definitely man there&rsquo;s way less good guys coming up</p>
<p>oh yeah or people</p>
<p>coming up in general just seems to be a</p>
<p>smaller community</p>
<p>i think so yeah i mean nationwide</p>
<p>right i think so yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a few</p>
<p>places that are really</p>
<p>like when you go to you&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>this place has a good</p>
<p>like comedy</p>
<p>community like within it you know like</p>
<p>i kind of felt that way in like austin</p>
<p>where i was like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really trying to like</p>
<p>like develop</p>
<p>comics here</p>
<p>yeah but i don&rsquo;t really feel that way in most</p>
<p>places like most</p>
<p>places it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>like the mall</p>
<p>or something you know it&rsquo;s just fucking hard to do</p>
<p>it seems a lot easier than it really is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like once you get good at it it kind of becomes</p>
<p>easy you just kind of like you know you know you</p>
<p>understand what</p>
<p>what it takes to</p>
<p>write a joke and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a matter of putting in the time putting the effort</p>
<p>but to get to a</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re actually funny is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a long fucking process</p>
<p>yeah like people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize like you see a guy like you know anybody joey</p>
<p>diaz joey diaz is a</p>
<p>great example</p>
<p>cause joey diaz is fucking hilarious</p>
<p>but when i met joey diaz</p>
<p>joey diaz is not</p>
<p>funny and that</p>
<p>sounds crazy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s one of the funniest people i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life yeah and he would say</p>
<p>funny shit off stage</p>
<p>but he could</p>
<p>never be that</p>
<p>funny on stage and</p>
<p>he could never make it happen and somewhere</p>
<p>along the line he just figured</p>
<p>it out he figured out how to be himself yeah who he is</p>
<p>like in the parking lot of the comedy store sure</p>
<p>figured out how to be that guy on</p>
<p>stage and all of a</p>
<p>sudden bam it was just he nailed it and</p>
<p>knocked it out</p>
<p>apart but that&rsquo;s like the hardest</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>right yeah i mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super hard like</p>
<p>you because i mean people now who i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you talk to them and you&rsquo;re like oh you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>funny but then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>forced and contrived on stage</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you got to figure out</p>
<p>how to make</p>
<p>the guy who you are off</p>
<p>stage just walk on</p>
<p>stage there was a guy that was doing</p>
<p>stand up who i thought was really funny</p>
<p>but he was doing this</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>where he was talking so fast that he</p>
<p>would take this breath</p>
<p>in between his</p>
<p>and then the government the government wanted to do</p>
<p>this obama situation with gays in the military</p>
<p>and they and like he was</p>
<p>going so fast like he kept taking this like</p>
<p>like in but it was like</p>
<p>audible yeah</p>
<p>really loud like a singer like yeah</p>
<p>and and especially if you&rsquo;re baked</p>
<p>like you could</p>
<p>focus on something like that i look for</p>
<p>you can forget exactly what he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>saying it down</p>
<p>just waiting</p>
<p>five four three two yeah i</p>
<p>would just focus on his crazy</p>
<p>that little breath</p>
<p>thing that he</p>
<p>does you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just joey diaz</p>
<p>when i talked to him</p>
<p>about it and i you know we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it a bunch of</p>
<p>times he says that what happened was he just realized</p>
<p>how to not give a fuck</p>
<p>he like he said he was too concerned with like</p>
<p>agents and managers and all that shit</p>
<p>and he was too concerned with people giving him advice</p>
<p>and he said it took</p>
<p>you know like realizing somewhere</p>
<p>along the line just realizing that</p>
<p>these guys are all</p>
<p>bunch of dummies like</p>
<p>seeing a bunch of them get fired</p>
<p>seeing managers and</p>
<p>agents fail miserably and fall by the wayside and</p>
<p>executives get fired and</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>hired people turn to drugs and become fucking</p>
<p>chaos and a mess and</p>
<p>so he just had to realize like oh</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>a really well set up artistic</p>
<p>environment they don&rsquo;t know what they want they just</p>
<p>want you to kill</p>
<p>and they can tell you all day they want you to be</p>
<p>squeaky clean you</p>
<p>gotta do this</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dirty and you destroy</p>
<p>they want you</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so you got like katt williams or you know of course</p>
<p>eddie murphy</p>
<p>and chris rock and all</p>
<p>these different guys</p>
<p>who have had you know sam kennison</p>
<p>dirty acts but so hilarious</p>
<p>that they were undeniable</p>
<p>so even in the era back then</p>
<p>which is pre internet</p>
<p>the kinesin</p>
<p>days were all pre internet</p>
<p>which is way harder to be dirty</p>
<p>cause you only had hbo that was your only</p>
<p>outlet for people to find out who the fuck you were</p>
<p>which is scary if you think</p>
<p>about it oh yeah in</p>
<p>comparison to</p>
<p>what we have</p>
<p>today you know</p>
<p>but even then man</p>
<p>all you have to do is be so good</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t give a fuck so good that they let it go</p>
<p>yeah and joey figured out how to do that you</p>
<p>know but for the longest time man he couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find a guy who gets it right</p>
<p>there was another guy</p>
<p>kurt metzger i worked with him in montreal this weekend</p>
<p>fucking hilarious i</p>
<p>know kurt very</p>
<p>funny he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>funny super</p>
<p>funny really good</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s just not enough there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>good guys out there and he&rsquo;s another guy probably</p>
<p>like when you saw me like who fucks this yeah yeah</p>
<p>well ari had actually already told me he was</p>
<p>funny yeah he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny yeah we were working this</p>
<p>this little tiny club in montreal i did</p>
<p>the this theater</p>
<p>called metropolis is like</p>
<p>a thousand seats or something like that</p>
<p>and then the day before we did this</p>
<p>local club called the comedy works</p>
<p>which i used to do</p>
<p>when i was living in boston</p>
<p>i was living in boston one of the my</p>
<p>first road gigs i used to go up to this</p>
<p>this guy jimbo owns this club in montreal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>club ever man it&rsquo;s fucking this tiny little room</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only like</p>
<p>maybe a hundred people can fit and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>stuffed into this place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>old school man the</p>
<p>microphone sucks</p>
<p>the wall behind you stupid</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s fucking curtains over</p>
<p>these windows behind you and they have them</p>
<p>covered with these old</p>
<p>dusty fucked up curtains</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter it&rsquo;s the best it&rsquo;s awesome it&rsquo;s just this</p>
<p>little tight place</p>
<p>and he was headlining there this week kurt metzger</p>
<p>and he was really fucking</p>
<p>funny and another one we hung out you know</p>
<p>me and him and ari went out and got something to eat</p>
<p>and like you</p>
<p>could tell right away</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>comic he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic he&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>comic yeah exactly yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool like you really feel like</p>
<p>like you wanna</p>
<p>when you meet guys like that or you wanna stay in</p>
<p>touch with them</p>
<p>you do like</p>
<p>soldiers on a battlefield yeah</p>
<p>you know you run into each other like wow</p>
<p>here we go we got another one</p>
<p>what people don&rsquo;t realize about comedians and it sounds</p>
<p>screwy that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about this that making a big deal out of it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not that many of them</p>
<p>when you look at the world okay look at the united</p>
<p>states just look at our country</p>
<p>three hundred million people in the united states</p>
<p>how many comedians</p>
<p>there might be a thousand</p>
<p>might be a thousand professional comedians</p>
<p>at three hundred million</p>
<p>how many of them are actually funny</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>three hundred</p>
<p>maybe three hundred out of a thousand and that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>generous yeah so this</p>
<p>three hundred people at a three hundred million</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one in a million</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking bananas</p>
<p>i said bananas again early</p>
<p>i said bananas like 50 times last week and i said i was</p>
<p>gonna say this week</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my latest</p>
<p>thing man whenever i</p>
<p>think anything&rsquo;s crazy i go 1960s on myself</p>
<p>yeah i go i repeat the shit out of</p>
<p>um out of control</p>
<p>say something&rsquo;s out of control yeah and</p>
<p>i say fired up well the</p>
<p>problem is we do it on a two two</p>
<p>hour podcast</p>
<p>once a week</p>
<p>after while</p>
<p>people like to we shut the fuck up with the bananas</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you listen to a</p>
<p>guy like say the same words it&rsquo;s like yeah you realize</p>
<p>when you do something like this how important it is to</p>
<p>very you know your</p>
<p>speech and not get locked into patterns of behavior</p>
<p>you know like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>heard like rappers who you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>a kimbo slides does you know i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>every other word no i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m here to put these</p>
<p>things on you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah of course i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard so many interviews with like</p>
<p>athletes say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>after everything</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s hilarious is when you hear</p>
<p>comics use nigger</p>
<p>like like a rapper</p>
<p>will use nigger and this</p>
<p>nigga try to tell me i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>nigga you better get the fuck out my face</p>
<p>nigga i know what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on nigga</p>
<p>and like they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll say it so many</p>
<p>times yeah yeah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say it on</p>
<p>stage the way guys will say it off</p>
<p>stage you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that gets lost when you do that</p>
<p>you know you got to recognize that like free</p>
<p>speech offstage</p>
<p>is not good enough to be bottled up and packaged</p>
<p>right you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sell it you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you got to have a better economy of words like i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll catch myself sometimes saying fuck too much</p>
<p>on stage because it&rsquo;s just natural</p>
<p>cause you do it in real life like this fucking guy is</p>
<p>stupid fucking idea</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t if you do that</p>
<p>it fucks up the bits</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>though they don&rsquo;t they lose</p>
<p>any potential impact</p>
<p>you know the concept you people get distracted by you</p>
<p>saying even</p>
<p>though this is just how you express yourself and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>people will get distracted</p>
<p>if you use too many of the same words over and over</p>
<p>again like i</p>
<p>swear like fuck</p>
<p>you know if you use it over and over and over</p>
<p>again like in like</p>
<p>more than one sentence</p>
<p>you could do it for one bit like if you&rsquo;re just so</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>upset at something yeah</p>
<p>i know that you just and it&rsquo;s part of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but then you have to make sure that you there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>peak in a valley in your at you have to make sure that</p>
<p>once you hit like all these</p>
<p>extra fucks like there&rsquo;s no fucks coming for a</p>
<p>while after this</p>
<p>sure sure yeah you know yeah yeah because then like</p>
<p>when you do it a lot also</p>
<p>like in one bit if you say fuck like a hundred times</p>
<p>you realize that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>essentially it&rsquo;s replacing</p>
<p>other words</p>
<p>that you know i mean that could</p>
<p>make that bit funnier or care</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s more like an uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a replacement for uh like this</p>
<p>guy um so it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just kind of</p>
<p>admitting that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you don&rsquo;t have a cohesive idea yeah</p>
<p>the other one like</p>
<p>i used to do</p>
<p>this all the time and now i do it less but i</p>
<p>still catch myself</p>
<p>going into it is</p>
<p>saying like setting one you&rsquo;re saying a bit then</p>
<p>going right</p>
<p>at the end of it and you don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re saying it</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re trying to basically</p>
<p>validate what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>right so like</p>
<p>like sort of subconsciously of</p>
<p>say a sentence to be like right</p>
<p>and then i walked in</p>
<p>right and the guy was like</p>
<p>right and then i listen to him like that</p>
<p>sounds fucking like</p>
<p>like an imbecile</p>
<p>fucking idiot right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so important to listen to your shit oh yeah</p>
<p>so important to watch your</p>
<p>stuff and listen to your</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s so painful</p>
<p>like the lab</p>
<p>people think the</p>
<p>comedians like look at me up there i&rsquo;m killing</p>
<p>when i watch my</p>
<p>stuff even stuff that i did that i like i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>watching it like even talking</p>
<p>monkeys in space</p>
<p>which was like my best special</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>watching that fucking</p>
<p>thing it feels</p>
<p>gross i hate</p>
<p>watching myself man it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>start judging your bits and</p>
<p>going ooh i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have the new tag line when i did this</p>
<p>before yeah yeah like sometimes you&rsquo;ll do a bit</p>
<p>and then right</p>
<p>after you come up with this bit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>think you got it nailed and you put it on a cd</p>
<p>and then like a week</p>
<p>later you have the best fucking tagline</p>
<p>that changes the whole bit</p>
<p>it makes it so much better you wanna like</p>
<p>go back in time</p>
<p>you wanna rewind yourself and not release it i</p>
<p>started on this i already have like</p>
<p>a few things that</p>
<p>i start adding</p>
<p>stuff to and i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>man i know and people who don&rsquo;t do it don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how manning that is that&rsquo;s why like a lot of</p>
<p>comics have a hard time</p>
<p>once you do your set you just want to get out of there</p>
<p>and move on with your life you don&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>really objectively go over all the beats and trying to</p>
<p>figure out what you did</p>
<p>wrong and what you did right</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t do that man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not as it&rsquo;s not as good</p>
<p>you have to make sure you do that</p>
<p>yeah you have to you have to look at your stuff man</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>i hope there&rsquo;s volume meters the</p>
<p>right way up</p>
<p>towards the red is like</p>
<p>on the you stream</p>
<p>producer that&rsquo;s how you get it as loud as you can</p>
<p>people still complain</p>
<p>about this shit</p>
<p>i uh you know the fact that i have</p>
<p>brian that he records almost all my sets that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so huge from that it&rsquo;s helped me so much that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>super and also like there&rsquo;s little</p>
<p>things that he does</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s just an all around</p>
<p>praise of brian but like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so cool i always dug like</p>
<p>the posters that you like just yeah yeah all those like</p>
<p>those are awesome yeah</p>
<p>makes those yeah well they&rsquo;re really cool</p>
<p>and he captures a lot of cool shit off stage</p>
<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s awesome man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one of the best things</p>
<p>about the internet is</p>
<p>being able to connect with people like that just weirdo</p>
<p>fucking creative people</p>
<p>you know that in</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s case you run a working for me</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re do you think</p>
<p>like of all like the</p>
<p>working like big name comics</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably on top of it the most</p>
<p>right like media like</p>
<p>internet stuff i</p>
<p>think about jane</p>
<p>cooks probably he&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>better at it than me</p>
<p>the whole like</p>
<p>twitter shit now the reason why i even got into that is</p>
<p>because i saw what it was doing for him that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>for like i say that</p>
<p>i was feeling people</p>
<p>compare try to</p>
<p>compare him to</p>
<p>other comedians with shady</p>
<p>reputations</p>
<p>you know i say</p>
<p>dana&rsquo;s done a lot more for comedy than like guys like</p>
<p>when see like you know by</p>
<p>a long shot</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like opened up people&rsquo;s eyes to what you</p>
<p>could do yourself sure</p>
<p>because before that the reality is none of us</p>
<p>are the type of guys that are</p>
<p>gonna be self</p>
<p>promoters like</p>
<p>comics are not self</p>
<p>promoters it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not normal it&rsquo;s like the word</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an aberration dan cookett it&rsquo;s like an unnatural</p>
<p>thing well i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s an unnatural</p>
<p>thing but it goes</p>
<p>contrary to like</p>
<p>what i was talking</p>
<p>about i was doing</p>
<p>the sid rosenthal</p>
<p>show on the</p>
<p>radio before i did this</p>
<p>and we were talking</p>
<p>about like he was like saying rank</p>
<p>yourself amongst comedians and i said the comedians</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last</p>
<p>thing you ever</p>
<p>wanna think</p>
<p>about is where do i stand</p>
<p>you know is</p>
<p>this guy better than me or that guy better than me</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>wanna judge yourself you just</p>
<p>wanna just try</p>
<p>to concentrate all your energy on doing the best shit</p>
<p>the last thing you</p>
<p>wanna concentrate on is pumping up your own ego</p>
<p>and you know just or even judging yourself at all</p>
<p>judge the material</p>
<p>go over the material</p>
<p>look at it try to make it better but always be</p>
<p>focused on that like</p>
<p>the like putting out the best shit that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>where you fit in with everybody else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like an enemy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>enemy of creativity is that kind of ego shit</p>

<p>my manager was this is the craziest</p>
<p>thing that anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever give me when they give me advice</p>
<p>yeah tell me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a masturbation tool what&rsquo;s the big deal</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like well it&rsquo;s pornographic</p>
<p>cause i guess it&rsquo;s like a rubber pussy</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s a masturbation tool and how is that pornographic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fake vagina</p>
<p>he goes well you use it when you</p>
<p>watch pornography</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s pornographic yeah</p>
<p>a rubber butthole</p>

<p>the idea is that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still living in this</p>
<p>childish world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to pretend that you don&rsquo;t masturbate</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>admitting that you masturbate</p>
<p>which we all</p>
<p>should there&rsquo;s nothing fucking</p>
<p>wrong with it this is</p>
<p>way better than jerking off can i see oh my goodness</p>
<p>this is crazy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so good man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better you</p>

<p>some special</p>
<p>fucking thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great man dude it&rsquo;s outstanding it&rsquo;s a hundred</p>

<p>all i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>lazy chicks</p>
<p>okay you gonna have to kick pick up your game</p>
<p>this is just the beginning okay</p>
<p>once they figured out this</p>
<p>what they figured out the</p>

<p>definitely probably so hard when</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s telling you what time you</p>

<p>and just beat off all over yourself go</p>
<p>right back to</p>
<p>sleep yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>describing like the last few years of my life</p>
<p>like and i and i&rsquo;m with that i&rsquo;m like that with</p>
<p>everything like</p>
<p>i like to like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about like</p>
<p>sleeping in jerking off</p>
<p>eating good food</p>
<p>yeah and anything that like feels good</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have needles in my arm sometimes like</p>
<p>cause we were you and i were on</p>
<p>the road once and we decided to get krispy kreme donuts</p>
<p>at like one o&rsquo;clock in the morning we went off</p>
<p>where the fuck was that</p>
<p>was that tampa</p>
<p>was it wait no if it was yeah</p>
<p>well it wasn&rsquo;t krispy kreme though</p>
<p>right or was it krispy kreme i</p>
<p>think it was or</p>
<p>maybe it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was some awesome donuts whatever the fuck it was</p>
<p>but dude we attack</p>
<p>those bitches</p>
<p>and we both knew that we really</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it and you had this look like all</p>
<p>right fuck it let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>ahead it was</p>
<p>just like as if i</p>
<p>asked you to do it go do some</p>
<p>crank with me yeah i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been doing it but</p>
<p>fuck it let&rsquo;s go do</p>
<p>it and then i&rsquo;m most like</p>
<p>like if somebody gives me</p>
<p>permission yes that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m kind of like</p>
<p>going through life waiting for somebody</p>
<p>to give me permission</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>do you wanna do this</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m gonna do this then i go</p>
<p>i have no control yeah what is that man what is that</p>
<p>about comedians</p>
<p>that just like</p>
<p>are looking for any excuse to do the wrong</p>
<p>thing wrong</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what feels good</p>
<p>but feels good to do the</p>
<p>wrong shit yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>what makes you become a comedian is you&rsquo;re resisting</p>
<p>everything that everybody else wants you to do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re resisting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re resisting being polite</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking rude shit</p>
<p>which is why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny right</p>
<p>right you know you&rsquo;re saying that rude shit to get the</p>
<p>laughs from people so you&rsquo;re disturbing everybody</p>
<p>no so you&rsquo;re resisting</p>
<p>like the way to become good and to become</p>
<p>funny is to be the guy that&rsquo;s willing to say that shit</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s why so many people say</p>
<p>about comedians like</p>
<p>like oh dude i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you say shit that i</p>
<p>think about all the time</p>
<p>but i never have the</p>
<p>guts to say it i mean how many times do people say that</p>
<p>absolutely about</p>
<p>especially you</p>
<p>nail some current events</p>
<p>issue they do that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what i thought but i didn&rsquo;t have the balls to say</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like that that</p>
<p>that willingness</p>
<p>to say shit that&rsquo;s like inappropriate or that</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>would think was offensive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like what makes you a</p>
<p>comic in the</p>
<p>first place sure</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all like a</p>
<p>party your whole</p>
<p>system i get you wanna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;re designed</p>
<p>to not fit in</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re designed to just</p>
<p>step away from all of it and poke fun at it</p>
<p>so it makes it so hard to</p>
<p>get your shit together</p>
<p>yeah it does man makes it so hard to be disciplined and</p>
<p>to show up for anything on time</p>
<p>is it like but you</p>
<p>gotta have like you have discipline though</p>
<p>right i mean as a i have some</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not the best at it i</p>
<p>force myself to do certain</p>
<p>things because i know that like like with my body</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a naturally</p>
<p>like i have a lot of energy</p>
<p>yeah you know and i have a lot of</p>
<p>aggressive energy and i my</p>
<p>whole life i&rsquo;ve been doing martial arts</p>
<p>since i was a child</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>literally there&rsquo;s been no time where i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;s something whether it&rsquo;s kickboxing or</p>
<p>jiu jitsu or something</p>
<p>that explosive</p>
<p>expenditure of energy has always been a part of my life</p>
<p>so if i take time off</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t do it for</p>
<p>three or four days or something like that</p>
<p>i start getting really antsy</p>
<p>and i get this</p>
<p>build up and i just fucking i just i just</p>
<p>wanna get it out and i get</p>
<p>annoyed in traffic</p>
<p>and i snap at</p>
<p>people when i shouldn&rsquo;t be snapping out i get</p>
<p>upset about</p>
<p>things that i shouldn&rsquo;t get upset at</p>
<p>yeah you know but when i&rsquo;m not doing that when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>training all the time</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m even</p>
<p>down just so mellow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i feel like i can be me</p>
<p>i enjoy life more i feel like there&rsquo;s less stress</p>
<p>in my body so</p>
<p>i can interpret the outside stress way better</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>dictated by your</p>
<p>way you operate</p>
<p>to be that way</p>
<p>well you know and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also you know the way my mind developed too growing up</p>
<p>we moved a lot around a lot and i don&rsquo;t know my dad i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t talked to him</p>
<p>since i was six years old or seven</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen him</p>
<p>since i was six</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t talked to him</p>
<p>since i was</p>
<p>seven so i was raised by my stepfather and we</p>
<p>moved around a lot</p>
<p>so i always had to like</p>
<p>fight against a lot of kids and different neighborhoods</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s always a lot of bullshit that i had to</p>
<p>fight against so my instincts</p>
<p>are always to resist all the shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on because people are just gonna say</p>
<p>stupid shit and get you in bad situations like</p>
<p>so i grew up with that</p>
<p>and then the physical</p>
<p>thing like fighting</p>
<p>things so it&rsquo;s always resisting</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s resisting yeah which is</p>
<p>terrible because then you resist your own direction</p>
<p>and your own</p>
<p>ideas and you can have like a plan like hey i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>take care of my body i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna you know</p>
<p>eat certain foods because they&rsquo;re healthy you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>work out you know in a certain time</p>
<p>every day because that&rsquo;s what i really need to get done</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna start writing material</p>
<p>every day even though it&rsquo;s for you and it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing and you&rsquo;ll enjoy</p>
<p>every single moment of all of it you</p>
<p>still resist doing it because it&rsquo;s some sort of a plan</p>
<p>and anything that&rsquo;s a plan is like i&rsquo;ll get this</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>yeah yeah exactly yeah and that&rsquo;s kind of like i think</p>
<p>every like comic</p>
<p>has that like resistance to for the most part like</p>
<p>this is how this is the status quo</p>
<p>like this yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a big part of it</p>
<p>right yeah that&rsquo;s kind of like why you&rsquo;re a standup</p>
<p>because you you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird because like the resistance</p>
<p>makes you a</p>
<p>comic and at the same time</p>
<p>to a degree if you&rsquo;re resistant</p>
<p>to too much it will hold you back from doing well</p>
<p>at comedy you have to realize somewhere</p>
<p>along the line that the reason why you got into comedy</p>
<p>is probably a bad reason</p>
<p>and for most of</p>
<p>us it&rsquo;s like we want an unnecessary amount of adulation</p>
<p>we want an un</p>
<p>you know we want more attention than the</p>
<p>other people do because</p>
<p>we feel like we didn&rsquo;t get it when we were young</p>
<p>right you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy build up</p>
<p>but then somewhere</p>
<p>along the line your</p>
<p>motivation has to</p>
<p>switch you have to kind of</p>
<p>understand what it really is</p>
<p>you know what i always say</p>
<p>about it is like</p>
<p>at a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be a transition</p>
<p>in your life as a comedian</p>
<p>where you start doing</p>
<p>it for the work and for the art and for the creation</p>
<p>of something to joy and making something that people</p>
<p>enjoy instead of</p>
<p>doing it so that people will like you</p>
<p>doing it so</p>
<p>that you can get all this attention and adulation on</p>
<p>stage you know because that&rsquo;s what when you want</p>
<p>the beginning you just want to be the fucking man yeah</p>
<p>get out there and kill yeah yeah yeah you</p>
<p>know and you want you want approval</p>
<p>you know you want people to be like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great and then</p>
<p>if you have a great set</p>
<p>and people tell you</p>
<p>stuff and you realize</p>
<p>how validating it was</p>
<p>then you realize how desperate you were</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>when you feel so good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so valid is so</p>
<p>happy by that</p>
<p>that great show early on</p>
<p>you just like how bad did i need that right</p>
<p>disturbing that i fucking</p>
<p>need people to be like</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re so amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird though</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that really creates comedy though</p>
<p>otherwise you probably are not gonna be</p>
<p>motivated enough to go through the beginning</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>cause how brutal is the beginning it&rsquo;s awful it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful man people don&rsquo;t know how painful it is to bum on</p>
<p>stage and how deserving it is</p>
<p>like you fucking deserved a bomb when you go yeah</p>
<p>you know you really do deserve it</p>
<p>yeah you know when you&rsquo;re bombing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause you fucking</p>
<p>really do suck and you&rsquo;re supposed to feel that shitty</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to be demanding attention you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not supposed to be with a</p>
<p>microphone with an amplified voice</p>
<p>your opinion&rsquo;s not that interesting no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not and all</p>
<p>these people hear that and it just</p>
<p>drives them fucking nuts man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not well thought out</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lived that much probably if you</p>
<p>started young enough</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that much</p>
<p>experience you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking 21 years old yeah you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>smart but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you know cause like when you like it&rsquo;s like being your</p>
<p>age now and you look</p>
<p>back at yourself 10 years ago you&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m a fucking</p>
<p>idiot is there</p>
<p>anything worse than</p>
<p>21 year old kids that</p>
<p>think they have the fucking political system</p>
<p>wired and they</p>
<p>want to talk</p>
<p>about politics on</p>
<p>stage oh it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst man oh</p>
<p>it really tears you up it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>silly it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing if they have a valid</p>
<p>point or a silly</p>
<p>point or something like that</p>
<p>but when they</p>
<p>start like telling you what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with republicans and</p>
<p>you know that the</p>
<p>democrats are trying to do this but the republicans are</p>
<p>trying to do that and they&rsquo;re stopping them and like</p>
<p>what are you fucking</p>
<p>what yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not like i&rsquo;m at a loss</p>
<p>for words sometimes you have to be fucking old as shit</p>
<p>for me to take you</p>
<p>serious when it comes to politics oh yeah man i have</p>
<p>to know that you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to this at</p>
<p>least at least</p>
<p>abstractly for</p>
<p>fucking decades</p>
<p>cause you have to be old</p>
<p>in order to have even a</p>
<p>somewhat objective</p>
<p>like unemotional</p>
<p>opinion about it</p>
<p>young people just go like this is fucked up man</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re not looking at it</p>
<p>for what it really is yeah they&rsquo;re looking at it from</p>
<p>their hardcore</p>
<p>bias towards one side or the</p>
<p>other they&rsquo;re not telling you what really is</p>
<p>going on no they&rsquo;re just like i really disagree</p>
<p>with what the</p>
<p>other people are doing and</p>
<p>which is like that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just your fucking opinion</p>
<p>do you guys hear that</p>
<p>water is that</p>
<p>water annoying</p>
<p>mrs rogan&rsquo;s running the fucking hose</p>
<p>this is such</p>
<p>a low rent podcast</p>
<p>situation hold on let me tell her to stop</p>
<p>yeah oh i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>right back ladies</p>
<p>dylan tommy talk</p>
<p>about your childhood</p>
<p>okay my childhood</p>
<p>it was really bad i was beaten</p>
<p>and hit a lot and i did a lot of drugs</p>
<p>stick to the</p>
<p>script oh that&rsquo;s nice oh wow that was quick</p>
<p>no no water they didn&rsquo;t hear the</p>
<p>water that&rsquo;s how i rule</p>
<p>there was water going on in the background this is from</p>
<p>my days working on fear factor we always have to</p>
<p>check for sound issues in the</p>
<p>background like occasionally would be</p>
<p>planes with flowers</p>
<p>to stop filming</p>
<p>i hear that</p>
<p>sound that starts to distract the shit out of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i run my house</p>
<p>folks with a fucking iron fist</p>
<p>all right when i&rsquo;m doing a podcast to be no</p>
<p>water in the</p>
<p>plants god damn it</p>
<p>um so we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about needy being needy being a comedian</p>
<p>the worst is when people don&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>that and they don&rsquo;t change and they keep that</p>
<p>goofy fucking ego like into their thirties and forties</p>
<p>you know and they&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>still trying to be the fucking man and</p>
<p>and what i really hate is the</p>
<p>like like what i call like the raw raw</p>
<p>comics like</p>
<p>like they have like a fake uh</p>
<p>enthusiasm yeah or or a fake with the</p>
<p>worst is fake and raged</p>
<p>yes oh like it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst like there&rsquo;s one dude specifically</p>
<p>who drives me</p>
<p>crazy and i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to be mean</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t want to be mean i&rsquo;ll tell you i had a guy</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>where but i&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards</p>
<p>that opened for me that his whole</p>
<p>thing was like</p>
<p>how fucked up this is man</p>
<p>and like it was just like there were</p>
<p>these contrived it</p>
<p>was contrived</p>
<p>rants about like</p>
<p>the man and like how</p>
<p>he was such a fucking rebel</p>
<p>and like he got you know and the</p>
<p>crowd just like yeah i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like dude</p>
<p>what you did is you just gave a stump speech</p>
<p>like you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running for office up there yeah and but in his mind</p>
<p>he is a brilliant revolutionary</p>
<p>comic you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for me like</p>
<p>the most pain i worked with the dude once and the dude</p>
<p>actually said this to the audience he said something</p>
<p>stupid something political</p>
<p>and then he paused and he goes</p>
<p>that usually gets an applause break</p>
<p>he actually said that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>could you imagine even</p>
<p>thinking that way</p>
<p>like thinking like why are you not giving</p>
<p>me my claps i deserve claps this is that we have to</p>
<p>agree on this</p>
<p>point yeah we should all</p>
<p>agree on this</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>applause breaks have to come</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t expect them oh my god</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be looking for them that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gross and honestly</p>
<p>the ones that like</p>
<p>i have gotten are</p>
<p>never ever like did you</p>
<p>think they were</p>
<p>gonna happen there</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>just a natural</p>
<p>thing you know you&rsquo;re like whoa i can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the line or that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point of view that gets an applause</p>
<p>break like yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so crazy that somebody&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>crafting them that</p>
<p>crafting applause</p>
<p>i had a friend of mine</p>
<p>when i was coming up he used to say</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>start clapping</p>
<p>you gotta pause and just hold it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll keep clapping</p>
<p>and a lot of times you&rsquo;ll get an applause</p>
<p>break when you wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten one that&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about man is that better for them</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re all in there together that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see to the mugging</p>
<p>for like when the punch line is not that good and then</p>
<p>right some some comics will like</p>
<p>say the punch line and then</p>
<p>the crowds like kind of</p>
<p>laughing and then they&rsquo;ll give them the like a</p>
<p>like there and a</p>
<p>pause and a</p>
<p>smile like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it was and see if they&rsquo;ll come along for it</p>
<p>or the worst is like</p>
<p>set is over</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see somebody kind of like force</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m done like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s force how much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna respond</p>
<p>at the end of my set like i know you just kind of</p>
<p>stand there so the</p>
<p>crowd is uncommon have you ever</p>
<p>seen a guy ask for a</p>
<p>standing ovation oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the funniest shit ever</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s so terrible</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen guys</p>
<p>they stay on</p>
<p>stage to go</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen last</p>
<p>night i had</p>
<p>a shower wasn&rsquo;t even as good as this i got a</p>
<p>standing ovation</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t even know how y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>gonna react</p>
<p>what the fuck is this guy doing he was like one of</p>
<p>those singing comedians</p>
<p>he would go up and sing songs he</p>
<p>would like you know like pretend he was like this guy</p>
<p>and like it wasn&rsquo;t even like really</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s just like he could</p>
<p>sound like those guys oh oh no</p>
<p>last night it</p>
<p>sounds like a</p>
<p>silly thing to worry</p>
<p>about you know it sounds like it&rsquo;s like why do you care</p>
<p>about fake enthusiasm</p>
<p>you know why do you care about that</p>
<p>the reason why you care about that is because</p>
<p>you realize that someone&rsquo;s operating on a</p>
<p>level that only works</p>
<p>against someone who doesn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a trick</p>
<p>but to everybody else who does</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>the only time it gets us</p>
<p>is someone who really really knows the trick</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s gotta be real it&rsquo;s gotta be a real genuine</p>
<p>thought that this guy has it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny and well put together</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll get us</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like when we see like an audience</p>
<p>laughing at something that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny to us like it&rsquo;s almost like insulting</p>
<p>it is it&rsquo;s exactly what</p>
<p>it is yeah it&rsquo;s like you fuck you trying to get me to</p>
<p>laugh with that yeah you know</p>
<p>you know that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trick like you can</p>
<p>sense you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he just did was he just you know</p>
<p>he just waves his hands</p>
<p>like that you know you know that it wasn&rsquo;t like genuine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing is you can</p>
<p>you when you</p>
<p>do it long enough and you see it long enough</p>
<p>you can tell when it&rsquo;s genuine</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s really like somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>now one of the</p>
<p>weirdest things</p>
<p>about tommy is</p>
<p>tommy is actually</p>
<p>married to a comedian</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s fucking really funny</p>
<p>and i saw her for the</p>
<p>first time was it like last</p>
<p>thursday what&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>again christina pajitski yeah</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t keep</p>
<p>tommy segura&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>notice that yeah who&rsquo;s wearing the</p>
<p>pants in that house huh</p>
<p>not me not me</p>
<p>she keep your name man her last name is</p>
<p>ridiculous her last name is</p>
<p>completely absurd why is she trying to keep that</p>
<p>stupid name well she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been doing</p>
<p>stand up for</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>or something well you don&rsquo;t want to lose that fucking</p>
<p>giant following</p>
<p>so maybe that&rsquo;s her fucking problem she&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just been holding her back is that name</p>
<p>i know i know i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>to and i took i&rsquo;d really fucking hold her down like</p>
<p>to check to get even like</p>
<p>the do the driver&rsquo;s license change not</p>
<p>really because she was just like it takes a lot of work</p>
<p>wow support you huh</p>
<p>yeah i was like fucking change</p>
<p>i want to own you</p>
<p>bitch and no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s just like that&rsquo;s weak</p>
<p>i know a dude who is a comic</p>
<p>in new york and he did the hyphen</p>
<p>thing and he took</p>
<p>her name last that&rsquo;s fucking unforgivable and he was a</p>
<p>comic and not just a comic but an established comic</p>
<p>i mean this is a guy who had a good following</p>
<p>really yes he had a good following he had done a</p>
<p>bunch of tv shows</p>
<p>he had you know done like the evening of the improv</p>
<p>sort of circuit he could headline he</p>
<p>would headline in clubs around town so he had like</p>
<p>he had like a real reputation of following</p>
<p>and this fucking guy</p>
<p>took his wife&rsquo;s name last it was</p>
<p>ridiculous that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>death of him right that&rsquo;s well eventually she want to</p>
<p>breaking up with them and that was the death</p>
<p>well it was even weirder</p>
<p>still because this guy used to get on</p>
<p>stage and proclaim himself to be a feminist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>which is ridiculous for women okay</p>
<p>just like it&rsquo;s just as ridiculous to</p>
<p>like be like all into being an american</p>
<p>you know like and look</p>
<p>america for sure is the best country but</p>
<p>guess what douchebag you know</p>
<p>you were born here you know</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t do anything to make this country is awesome</p>
<p>yeah you know what you do</p>
<p>what did you do to make this the best you know did</p>
<p>you a part of the declaration of independence</p>
<p>did you you know come on man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>proud of being born a certain</p>
<p>patch of dirt that&rsquo;s so it makes no sense you have that</p>
<p>respecting the</p>
<p>ideals and respecting</p>
<p>what it is to you and and and being</p>
<p>proud to be a part of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>the civilization that&rsquo;s at the cusp of</p>
<p>humanity and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the people that move from</p>
<p>everywhere else what america&rsquo;s supposed to be is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the people who came from</p>
<p>everywhere else and came to this one spot</p>
<p>so the ideal of it</p>
<p>should be like you</p>
<p>should have some</p>
<p>pride in the</p>
<p>ideal but i</p>
<p>think that somehow another you&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from this dirt and you got a problem with some</p>
<p>other dudes from that dirt</p>
<p>what the fuck you have no credit or</p>
<p>blame for where you&rsquo;re born ever like it&rsquo;s absurd to</p>
<p>think that like it&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you can go you know what</p>
<p>like people that are born in like the congo you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that fucking sucks man</p>
<p>that guy did</p>
<p>nothing to deserve being born in a horrible</p>
<p>place yeah but also like you didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>amazing to be born in fucking</p>
<p>you know yeah it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great to have a</p>
<p>vagina you didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t ask to be a</p>
<p>woman i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>to be a feminist</p>
<p>like to only like</p>
<p>being into like feminine</p>
<p>values and pushing forth</p>
<p>i understand that you</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting against something i totally</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>but we should all be</p>
<p>against oppression for everyone</p>
<p>not just oppression for women</p>
<p>to concentrate on that just as a</p>
<p>group like every</p>
<p>feminist i have ever met to a</p>
<p>woman and i&rsquo;ve only met two</p>
<p>been really fucking</p>
<p>annoying how</p>
<p>about probably went</p>
<p>more into were they were</p>
<p>no they were horrendous</p>
<p>one of them had an argument with</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>store some crazy lady</p>
<p>who like started insulting me i try to be like</p>
<p>super nice to her</p>
<p>this is a video of it online</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like a performance artist</p>
<p>slash feminist and</p>
<p>and she like</p>
<p>she fucking turned on me i</p>
<p>tried to like</p>
<p>just talk to her she was asking me questions and she</p>
<p>actually interrupted a conversation that i was having</p>
<p>with somebody else</p>
<p>and she started talking to me and then somewhere</p>
<p>along the line she kept</p>
<p>telling me to</p>
<p>look in her eyes when i was talking to her i just got</p>
<p>i got annoyed and i just</p>
<p>started attacking her</p>
<p>which is yeah</p>
<p>which is what i tend to do</p>
<p>when people are douchey</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never i</p>
<p>think that whole like i mean just i&rsquo;m totally for</p>
<p>like like i said nobody</p>
<p>being discriminated</p>
<p>against right</p>
<p>absolutely but like the</p>
<p>people who really subscribe to like when it&rsquo;s a woman</p>
<p>that really subscribe so i</p>
<p>gotta be a champion of women</p>
<p>i find for the most of the part most of the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s women that were not ever like</p>
<p>pursued that the guys didn&rsquo;t really want them and they</p>
<p>go off like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never a really</p>
<p>attractive woman that</p>
<p>rights men like</p>
<p>climbing all over</p>
<p>fighting all over of</p>
<p>course to get to her and if she is she&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy she&rsquo;s out of her mind</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never mind</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i always feel</p>
<p>about the same way i always feel</p>
<p>about guys like al</p>
<p>sharpton guys like</p>
<p>jesse jackson that are only involved in</p>
<p>black and white issues</p>
<p>only involved in</p>
<p>black people issues i&rsquo;m like fucking really and</p>
<p>really and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only involved</p>
<p>their only motivation</p>
<p>and their only</p>
<p>motivation is they love being on camera</p>
<p>right well and being on camera is the reason why i</p>
<p>wear fucking expensive suits and driving beautiful cars</p>
<p>they have become the</p>
<p>voice of discrimination</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>you have one person or two people</p>
<p>and one of them how</p>
<p>about al sharpton</p>
<p>he starts his</p>
<p>whole career</p>
<p>started out over a</p>
<p>false rape accusation by some</p>
<p>crazy chick</p>
<p>that he got behind they blamed it on</p>
<p>white people as</p>
<p>tijuana brawley case</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about this she</p>
<p>smeared shit on her own body and</p>
<p>claimed that she got</p>
<p>raped really you didn&rsquo;t know the story</p>
<p>you gotta look it up google</p>
<p>tijuana brawley</p>
<p>al sharpton</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hilarious</p>
<p>story it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she falsely accused people of rape</p>
<p>and he you know</p>
<p>made his career out of</p>
<p>you know getting in the public eye</p>
<p>and you know and making a</p>
<p>big deal out of this and turning into his gigantic rape</p>
<p>issue i think that guy loves</p>
<p>when when any</p>
<p>black person has something</p>
<p>like scandalous have yet</p>
<p>he loves it</p>
<p>he gets to come on be like this is a travesty</p>
<p>yeah he gets to talk it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking bullshit man yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s incredible that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two guys that are at the</p>
<p>forefront of any like public</p>
<p>issue that has to do with race</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s do with</p>
<p>black and white people</p>
<p>but it does not race either</p>
<p>because if there&rsquo;s some gigantic</p>
<p>vietnamese and</p>
<p>white person</p>
<p>issue this i fucking doubt</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>jesse jackson on tv trying</p>
<p>to that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing man is that like they asked al</p>
<p>sharpton one time</p>
<p>hey would you because he</p>
<p>came to the rescue of like some i don&rsquo;t know he came to</p>
<p>speak out because oh some kid like got kicked out of</p>
<p>school for fighting at the</p>
<p>school and as a</p>
<p>black kid of course</p>
<p>right and he</p>
<p>was like of course what</p>
<p>the fuck you saying</p>
<p>well i mean i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t care i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t show up if it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>black person</p>
<p>so they go like</p>
<p>words will you fucking</p>
<p>would you do</p>
<p>would you care</p>
<p>would you show up</p>
<p>if like if it was a</p>
<p>white kid he was</p>
<p>absolutely if they were to</p>
<p>reach out to me</p>
<p>i would that&rsquo;s complete bullshit he well</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>sharpton he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>whorish that</p>
<p>he might go</p>
<p>on just for the opportunity to show that he&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about black but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never happened but nobody invites him yeah</p>
<p>if a white kid gets in</p>
<p>trouble nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna invite i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna call him i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>next time some</p>
<p>white shit happens</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m calling out</p>
<p>sharpton and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna ask him to please show up</p>
<p>how do we fix that how do we fix this</p>
<p>ridiculous idea</p>
<p>that black people and</p>
<p>white people</p>
<p>and that like you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>group of them and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>against a group of us and men against</p>
<p>women against</p>
<p>i would say these</p>
<p>three types of people in the world</p>
<p>morons assholes</p>
<p>and people you</p>
<p>can hang out with and that&rsquo;s reality and there</p>
<p>might be some people in</p>
<p>those people that you can hang out that you</p>
<p>truly love there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broad spectrum and</p>
<p>other people that you can just tolerate</p>
<p>sure but that&rsquo;s the group it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>morons assholes and people you can hang out with</p>
<p>and sometimes you can hang out with assholes if you</p>
<p>know them well enough or if you grew up with them and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that i grew up with that i</p>
<p>still keep in</p>
<p>touch with that i probably</p>
<p>would never talk to</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t grow up with them oh</p>
<p>sure guys i used to do martial arts with and</p>
<p>stuff and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of dudes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m happy to talk to them and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>happy they&rsquo;re in my life</p>
<p>but the reality is if i met him</p>
<p>today we wouldn&rsquo;t be such</p>
<p>close friends oh</p>
<p>i know exactly</p>
<p>right yeah absolutely</p>
<p>but the idea that we</p>
<p>still do this in</p>
<p>2010 like is that</p>
<p>gonna change ever</p>
<p>are we ever gonna like</p>
<p>melt together to be one fucking big</p>
<p>giant mocha race</p>
<p>you know like a combination of everybody and just</p>
<p>drop all the nutty diversity that</p>
<p>causes problems</p>
<p>i think in this country it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come pretty fucking</p>
<p>close people love diversity don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong a lot of people say oh diversity</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cause problems</p>
<p>racism cause problems</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s actually a challenge</p>
<p>to look at people and</p>
<p>judge them not by</p>
<p>you know as martin luther</p>
<p>king said by the</p>
<p>color of their skin by the content of the character</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a challenge and that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and i agree yeah</p>
<p>definitely for me it is i like having a</p>
<p>bunch of different people but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if like as a race if we can figure out a way as a</p>
<p>human race to</p>
<p>not differentiate because of the way we look</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if we can i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on that</p>
<p>like people&rsquo;s natural instinct</p>
<p>is to like and i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the judge but it&rsquo;s also to be</p>
<p>drawn to people like you</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s just and it&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not totally true because why do</p>
<p>black guys like to fuck so many</p>
<p>white girls</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that about man</p>
<p>they only go for the pigs</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s just the ones they can get</p>
<p>well listen man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>black dudes out there fucking a lot of</p>
<p>white girls don&rsquo;t go crazy</p>
<p>no yeah i agree</p>
<p>but especially</p>
<p>athletes like you ever seen like michael jordan</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always with tens</p>
<p>everywhere he goes oh</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s michael jordan</p>
<p>getting in his car with a ten</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying but they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>white he&rsquo;s got a badass like i</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s like a cuban</p>
<p>bitch right now</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s out yeah</p>
<p>look at tiger woods all hot</p>
<p>white chicks you know</p>
<p>yeah yeah but</p>
<p>tiger woods is an amalgamation</p>
<p>himself but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re out you usually see the brothers with like</p>
<p>a chick i mean you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t go to the really good</p>
<p>places so maybe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good</p>
<p>places but i</p>
<p>usually see them with fucking animals like the</p>
<p>beast oh yeah</p>
<p>and anne it&rsquo;ll be like a chick who</p>
<p>is driving him</p>
<p>be like i just got you some shoes and like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bad deal yeah look i think</p>
<p>water seeks its own level</p>
<p>and if that ugly chick can get a good looking</p>
<p>black man to fuck the shit out of her</p>
<p>every week and</p>
<p>so what if he robs her every now and then</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>with that but wait do you</p>
<p>think though like if you were to walk into like a</p>
<p>whatever a room somewhere</p>
<p>and there and it was it was segregated</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be the inclination that you would go towards</p>
<p>the white people yeah</p>
<p>i wish i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but it depends on where i am</p>
<p>you know but i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even like</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a group of people like if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>group of comedians or something like that no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like if it&rsquo;s a group of comedians it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a you&rsquo;re all the same</p>
<p>right don&rsquo;t you feel like that yeah you walk into a</p>
<p>group you know</p>
<p>if but if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>them if you don&rsquo;t know anything you didn&rsquo;t know anybody</p>
<p>yeah you might go towards the</p>
<p>white guy and but a</p>
<p>black guy would walk</p>
<p>with depends on how the</p>
<p>black guys are dressed</p>
<p>addresses suits and</p>
<p>ties and they look like businessmen</p>
<p>yeah then i</p>
<p>might go to them you know</p>
<p>but what if they all had on blue or red caps and and</p>
<p>then i would go to the white guys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go to the biggest fattest</p>
<p>white guy to</p>
<p>stand behind in case</p>
<p>shit happens yeah</p>
<p>real close to the door i try to</p>
<p>angle myself try to line up the room</p>
<p>you know but i</p>
<p>think like if</p>
<p>you go in somewhere you&rsquo;ll see like you know</p>
<p>asians will be with</p>
<p>asians and latin people</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a part of our</p>
<p>natural inclination from back when we were</p>
<p>tribes of monkey people</p>
<p>to select a group</p>
<p>and to stay with that</p>
<p>group and to assume that all the</p>
<p>other groups are</p>
<p>against you</p>
<p>know i mean that&rsquo;s what we do with</p>
<p>sports teams</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we do in with</p>
<p>state pride you know that&rsquo;s what we do in the north</p>
<p>versus the south</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really all the same thing</p>
<p>yes like it&rsquo;s all team shit</p>
<p>you know there was</p>
<p>a theory that we talked</p>
<p>about on here</p>
<p>on the show before that this</p>
<p>anthropologist</p>
<p>came up with it&rsquo;s called dunbar&rsquo;s number</p>
<p>and dunbar&rsquo;s number is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about the number of people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re capable of remembering and having</p>
<p>stable relationships with</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>150 people is the most</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the theory the theory is oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right or not but it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>close in my opinion knowing a lot of people i think</p>
<p>150 people sounds</p>
<p>about right yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t have that many more people in your life</p>
<p>because if you do it&rsquo;s just too confusing and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the capacity to remember it it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>our culture</p>
<p>has evolved so far that it&rsquo;s an operating</p>
<p>system that are</p>
<p>hard drive isn&rsquo;t capable of processing like</p>
<p>what our operating</p>
<p>system is our operating</p>
<p>system and our memory and our hardware is set up for</p>
<p>living you know in fucking</p>
<p>you know 10 000 bc</p>
<p>yeah rolling</p>
<p>sticks with rocks</p>
<p>sharp rocks at the end of it as at moving animals yeah</p>
<p>our hardware</p>
<p>has barely evolved past that</p>
<p>but our software our culture</p>
<p>is just fucking like</p>
<p>crazy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three hundred million of us all in this</p>
<p>one continent and all supposed to be on the same team</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much disconnection</p>
<p>that we try to get</p>
<p>connections</p>
<p>like little</p>
<p>small connections the the</p>
<p>tribe itself is too massive</p>
<p>i think like</p>
<p>thousands and thousands of years ago like you know</p>
<p>when people had</p>
<p>when we were</p>
<p>tribes of hunters and gatherers and were nomadic and</p>
<p>everything like that like</p>
<p>the bond between people in those</p>
<p>tribes must have</p>
<p>been so fucking intense really so much better and more</p>
<p>more cooperation more love for each</p>
<p>other more community than we have today</p>
<p>i mean do you even fucking</p>
<p>know your neighbors man do you know your neighbors</p>
<p>but i think part</p>
<p>no i do not</p>
<p>actually this guy who lives over here is a douchebag</p>
<p>i know that he lets his dogs go out and they bite</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s dogs</p>
<p>then you know i got this guy up the</p>
<p>street it&rsquo;s kind of a pain in the ass and this lady&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird and so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asked weird questions it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i barely know</p>
<p>these fucking people i waved a few of</p>
<p>them yeah you know some of them i like to see him but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like it used to be man i live</p>
<p>i live doors down i live in an</p>
<p>apartment yeah i live</p>
<p>like and you</p>
<p>even know the people next to you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>their names that&rsquo;s crazy yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re living in like a</p>
<p>hotel yeah i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s you know part of it is that i feel like</p>
<p>today it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>like we kind of</p>
<p>almost in a</p>
<p>weird way encourage people to be</p>
<p>selfish yeah</p>
<p>we tell people like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t waste your time</p>
<p>with that don&rsquo;t do this and that for so and so like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>look out for yourself shit yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too many of us yeah don&rsquo;t go out of</p>
<p>your way for somebody man that&rsquo;s kind of the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our culture has</p>
<p>evolved into this</p>
<p>weird place</p>
<p>to deal with the fact that there&rsquo;s so many of us</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just too fucking many</p>
<p>human beings in this one</p>
<p>place yeah you know for for the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wired not too many beans</p>
<p>mean obviously</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not sustainable if we keep growing at this rate</p>
<p>but the rate</p>
<p>like right now we have enough food if</p>
<p>we you know</p>
<p>concentrating</p>
<p>everything and do mean we&rsquo;re feeding</p>
<p>people you know we are getting it done right now</p>
<p>yeah but man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re set up for much</p>
<p>smaller groups oh yeah that shit will</p>
<p>hypnotize you you can&rsquo;t look at that i know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i got distracted</p>
<p>fuck with you</p>
<p>and then you won&rsquo;t be able to have a conversation yeah</p>
<p>sorry and the chat will</p>
<p>blind you with its retardation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some cool people in that trap but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>monsters in there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some fucking monkeys</p>
<p>so anyway the way we got out to this subject was</p>
<p>feminism and the idea that this poor fuck who</p>
<p>changed his name was actually a male feminist</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so depressing so sad</p>
<p>a woman being a woman being</p>
<p>a mail list is that a is that a word</p>
<p>you know could you imagine a woman who like</p>
<p>sticks up for men&rsquo;s rights that would be just a whore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you would think about that girl that</p>
<p>might be like a girl that survives on loads</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part like if she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have them she doesn&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s like a lowed vampire</p>
<p>yeah give me</p>
<p>those chug chug chug could you imagine what a</p>
<p>ridiculous idea that a woman would be a maleist</p>
<p>you know and everybody would have such a definitive</p>
<p>what was the word</p>
<p>masculinist</p>
<p>is there a word i don&rsquo;t think there is even a word</p>
<p>feminist is such a common part of our vocabulary</p>
<p>but the male pro male yeah is like</p>
<p>like us 101 was like as close as we got</p>
<p>but any yeah any</p>
<p>woman that would be only into men you would</p>
<p>know chicks would</p>
<p>trust that fucking bitch no no way for a</p>
<p>second she&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>you know like standing up for men&rsquo;s rights and chick</p>
<p>no chicks would trust her and guys would</p>
<p>just like they&rsquo;d be all over it but they would also be</p>
<p>like you would be like something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with this bitch yeah</p>
<p>they would think it&rsquo;s a gimmick too</p>
<p>which i thought with him with this guy he would go on</p>
<p>stage and talk about on stage how he&rsquo;s a feminist and i</p>
<p>would be like oh my god</p>
<p>and with chicks just cheer like yeah</p>
<p>the broken ones yeah</p>
<p>the broken ones that like to see a man who&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s weak and wearing a bridle in his mouth</p>
<p>with marks on his ass yeah that&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for a fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sad guy man</p>
<p>the groups man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to be a female comedian and this is</p>
<p>where we all got started from you know this you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t your wife wouldn&rsquo;t change her name yeah yeah</p>
<p>so your your wife even though she won&rsquo;t change her name</p>
<p>still very funny and</p>
<p>how long she been doing comedy yeah about eight years</p>
<p>eight years yeah by years</p>
<p>so you guys would like pretty similar timelines</p>
<p>yeah how many years you&rsquo;ve been doing it now eight</p>
<p>eight yep hmm</p>
<p>where&rsquo;d you meet her</p>
<p>i met her in a room doing</p>
<p>the show yeah</p>
<p>did you fuck her that night no enough time</p>
<p>she had a different boyfriend at the time</p>
<p>really yeah you</p>
<p>stole that bitch well now they</p>
<p>broke up i mean they</p>
<p>were having anything to do with them</p>
<p>breaking out no nothing nothing i always</p>
<p>thought she was cool</p>
<p>yeah i thought they were cool nice and like i just</p>
<p>i thought i</p>
<p>liked her but i was like that&rsquo;s just like not</p>
<p>gonna happen like</p>
<p>they were together a</p>
<p>while man like few years</p>
<p>how did he fuck up</p>

<p>marry that guy so wow</p>
<p>yeah then i came in there and i just took that shit</p>
<p>you just grabbed it yeah just came in and took what</p>
<p>she was vulnerable yeah you got her on the rebound</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>i totally did how many weeks</p>
<p>after the breakup did you get her i think it was like</p>
<p>i think like a couple months had passed couple</p>
<p>months i think so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a good person she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking huh yeah yeah</p>
<p>chicks get mad</p>
<p>so they get so mad when you</p>
<p>break up with a chick and you have a new one</p>
<p>right away yeah</p>
<p>angry yeah yeah you know a friend of ours is</p>
<p>going through a situation like that right now</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really talk about</p>
<p>yeah yeah but his his access</p>
<p>angry at him oh cause</p>
<p>yeah i bet it&rsquo;s really high</p>
<p>angry like a motherfucker yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah she whatever</p>
<p>what you do man</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be good man yeah</p>
<p>you know this that attachment that people have to each</p>
<p>other so fucking intense that when they break</p>
<p>when someone</p>
<p>breaks up with you and then</p>
<p>starts dating someone else that you feel like they</p>
<p>stole from you like they</p>
<p>stole your happiness</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my fucking happiness and why am i</p>
<p>why is my happiness been replaced with deep</p>
<p>sorrow and sad</p>
<p>devastating feeling man</p>
<p>crushing man there&rsquo;s nothing actually</p>
<p>like separate from that that makes you feel that</p>
<p>quite that way</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t think of anything</p>
<p>else like death</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>death it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>death a dog dies more than a dog dies</p>
<p>a friend dies a friend or</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s a devastating</p>
<p>thing for people man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>nature has its</p>
<p>setup that we attach to each other</p>
<p>that we become</p>
<p>addicted to each</p>
<p>other and then we</p>
<p>literally having that person in your life it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your whole formula</p>
<p>your your whole</p>
<p>like balance is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>requires having that person in the system</p>
<p>right you have a</p>
<p>whole system and</p>
<p>that person you go to for your love and your sex and</p>
<p>your and they</p>
<p>like a lock into your grid and</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gone it&rsquo;s like you have this gaping hole</p>
<p>where that person used to be yeah</p>
<p>and most people just try to fill that</p>
<p>bitch up real</p>
<p>quick yeah yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next one</p>
<p>the next one</p>
<p>yeah we got a leak</p>
<p>you know plug it up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird man but it&rsquo;s all set up so that we</p>
<p>breed it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>these weird little</p>
<p>biological tricks</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the the irrationality of the</p>
<p>breakup depression</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so intense and you</p>
<p>could tell people all day</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people out there you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter you can say</p>
<p>you can rationalize all day</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be times</p>
<p>where people make</p>
<p>phone calls they</p>
<p>should not fucking make</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>but if i just call her</p>
<p>maybe i never expressed myself</p>
<p>maybe i never did it the right way</p>
<p>and then you call and then there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>empty feeling</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking to them they really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to talk to you and they&rsquo;re like listen</p>
<p>i think i need</p>
<p>to be by myself listen just give me a chance</p>
<p>just try no</p>
<p>i am with someone</p>
<p>right now and like what</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re what and then</p>
<p>and then you hang up and then you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep and you&rsquo;re devastated</p>
<p>like what a trick</p>
<p>what a terrible</p>
<p>trick and if</p>
<p>you look back on some of the times you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>those situations and</p>
<p>how fucking</p>
<p>happy you are that they</p>
<p>you broke up with that person oh</p>
<p>sure man yeah</p>
<p>how many times</p>
<p>does that happen when you look back on like</p>
<p>like when i was 21 and my</p>
<p>girlfriend broke up with me i was so sad</p>
<p>for like a week i couldn&rsquo;t believe i thought she was</p>
<p>gonna be the one</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>babies together and shit but now i</p>
<p>think back i&rsquo;m like what if i got</p>
<p>stuck with her oh yeah</p>
<p>oh all right i</p>
<p>think about just like times</p>
<p>where like i went out even you know</p>
<p>when i was like wanted to pursue somebody and then like</p>
<p>maybe went out with him a few times and it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work out didn&rsquo;t evolve</p>
<p>and how that was like</p>
<p>like you know like depressing you like right</p>
<p>and you met and then you get to like you</p>
<p>sort of get</p>
<p>to know the person from a distance you like you imagine</p>
<p>but ended up like if that had worked out i</p>
<p>would be miserable</p>
<p>today you ever had an</p>
<p>angry girlfriend</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ve got a few</p>
<p>angry ones no i&rsquo;ve had a few</p>
<p>angry ones the</p>
<p>angry ones are so strange</p>
<p>because you just tolerate</p>
<p>like this this</p>
<p>yelling and this craziness in your life you</p>
<p>tolerate people getting pissed you tolerate negativity</p>
<p>and then you realize one day like you</p>
<p>break up with them and you go okay</p>
<p>the the fucking</p>
<p>noise has stopped yeah like</p>
<p>the my i feel so much better like</p>
<p>i was dating a fucking</p>
<p>crazy person</p>
<p>shaking your</p>
<p>core yeah i was dating</p>
<p>some fucking some</p>
<p>monster some some deficit in my life you know yeah i i</p>
<p>i lived with somebody who</p>
<p>no no not but not a</p>
<p>girlfriend had roommates</p>
<p>and one of my roommates</p>
<p>dated a fucking a monster</p>
<p>when they ended it it was like the whole</p>
<p>like the whole</p>
<p>apartment complex</p>
<p>calmed down like it you know i mean it was like</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>i do is supposed to be this</p>
<p>chill yeah you were</p>
<p>you were bringing fucking</p>
<p>devastation to this</p>
<p>place every day</p>
<p>why did you invite an earthquake in here</p>
<p>every single day like that&rsquo;s do she roommates do she do</p>
<p>anything do she in your life you</p>
<p>gotta you gotta figure out a way to</p>
<p>separate yourself from that like that&rsquo;s like number one</p>
<p>like any shit you have to deal with like if</p>
<p>you have a fucked up job and it&rsquo;s a bad situation you</p>
<p>gotta get the fuck out</p>
<p>oh man just go</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t just swallow that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why so many guys go postal</p>
<p>you know you hear that</p>
<p>expression postal</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a reason why that</p>
<p>expression exists</p>
<p>cause that job sucks yep</p>
<p>that job is</p>
<p>boring as fuck and you work with a</p>
<p>bunch of assholes</p>
<p>and one day you go i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get a fucking gun and i&rsquo;m gonna kill</p>
<p>every last one of you douchebags</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>have been the source of your pain and frustration</p>
<p>every goddamn day</p>
<p>you show up at work there&rsquo;s negativity</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>not saying that the guy who</p>
<p>shoots him isn&rsquo;t the fucking</p>
<p>the cause of it</p>
<p>yeah yeah sure</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like to them like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re hard wired</p>
<p>wrong so whatever whatever the fuck</p>
<p>the reason they hate it</p>
<p>you know they get there and it&rsquo;s just shit</p>
<p>every day it&rsquo;s shit and with other</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people out there that just</p>
<p>hate everyone they have to deal with</p>
<p>everything and they</p>
<p>have bosses that fuck with them and and</p>
<p>and you realize too man like</p>
<p>after you know when you get like a little bit older you</p>
<p>start to figure out that like you&rsquo;re in control</p>
<p>of of like your own happiness in a lot of ways like you</p>
<p>are but you&rsquo;re not when you get all locked up with debt</p>
<p>the thing is you get a car and you get an</p>
<p>apartment and you know in</p>
<p>you know you have bills you have to pay</p>
<p>every fucking month</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things get</p>
<p>tricky cause then</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>this economy like what do you do you fucking just</p>
<p>cast yourself</p>
<p>off freed you quit this without having another job</p>
<p>no what do you do i</p>
<p>think that well there&rsquo;s like borderline like</p>

<p>job i know it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s easy get your</p>
<p>own shit together you can get your shit together you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting your own shit together the only way you&rsquo;re ever</p>
<p>gonna really have a fun life and a fun relationship now</p>

<p>likelihood of somebody being 36 and being as good as</p>
<p>robert schimmel</p>
<p>has got to be</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like in the</p>
<p>like in the billions</p>
<p>right like that like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not supposed to happen it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>supposed to happen usually when people</p>
<p>start out in their late</p>
<p>thirties they just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too late</p>
<p>i started when i was</p>
<p>twenty one i</p>
<p>started just a few weeks</p>
<p>after my twenty</p>
<p>first birthday</p>
<p>i might turn twenty one</p>
<p>august eleventh nineteen</p>
<p>eighty eight</p>
<p>and august twenty</p>
<p>seventh is the</p>
<p>first time i went on stage</p>
<p>wow man yeah</p>
<p>what about you</p>
<p>i want i started</p>
<p>when i was twenty i</p>
<p>i just turned</p>
<p>twenty three yeah right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>right because you&rsquo;re not a</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not locked into any sort of success</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re moving up the</p>
<p>corporate ladder and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing pretty good and you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna you don&rsquo;t want to fucking</p>
<p>sidetrack that and try to do</p>
<p>stand up and then have the</p>
<p>stand up not work out and you go well i</p>
<p>could have been a</p>
<p>success yeah yeah</p>
<p>i know a couple</p>
<p>guys that did that i know a couple guys that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s hard to give up your lifestyle</p>
<p>if you got like it is you&rsquo;re making good money</p>
<p>in a regular job it&rsquo;s one of the hardest things</p>
<p>that that leap that untethering from the</p>
<p>system absolutely</p>
<p>make it into show business</p>
<p>quote unquote</p>
<p>especially something as volatile</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>especially in the beginning</p>
<p>when you really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing oh yeah you know</p>
<p>i was lucky i was</p>
<p>twenty one and i you know i had a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>

<p>i had a car that i was making payments on and once i</p>
<p>started doing comedy i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money i got</p>
<p>my car got repossessed i had to get the shit really</p>
<p>are yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah i went broke</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>no other way around it you know no there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>when i think</p>
<p>about how many times i&rsquo;ve approached</p>
<p>like a rice</p>
<p>basically devastation</p>
<p>is near financial devastation</p>
<p>when you can see it yeah</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the bank account and you go</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the calendar and you know</p>
<p>how am i gonna make</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s like the universe provides right like</p>
<p>right when you&rsquo;re like oh i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>something will happen as long as you keep</p>
<p>working as you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>as long as you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t sit around and wait for it to provide</p>
<p>as long as you keep hustling and keep</p>
<p>grinding you</p>
<p>know yeah the universe will provide</p>
<p>yeah you know and</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>

<p>great you went up to my</p>
<p>house up there you know yeah dude</p>
<p>that shit was fucking sick</p>
<p>yeah that was sick</p>
<p>it was too bad a mountain lion</p>
<p>ate my goddamn dog did it really and yeah too bad my</p>
<p>chick doesn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>drive in the fucking snow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the problem</p>
<p>she hit a wall a tree</p>
<p>and she hit</p>
<p>the side of a mountain she</p>
<p>is two separate accidents</p>
<p>and snowy road</p>
<p>she says not a driver the snow at all she grew up in</p>
<p>texas anyway</p>
<p>after the what a</p>
<p>second time</p>
<p>it was like i go on the road too much i&rsquo;m like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave you here you don&rsquo;t know how to fucking</p>
<p>drive in the snow so</p>
<p>ridiculous when the mountains</p>
<p>should not i grew up in boston</p>
<p>dude i not only did i grow up in boston</p>
<p>i had a newspaper</p>
<p>route for five years</p>
<p>that means that for five fucking years</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter how much snow was out i was driving</p>
<p>yeah i drove</p>
<p>every goddamn day</p>
<p>i know how to hit that slide</p>
<p>counter that bitch</p>
<p>i know how to stay calm and pump the</p>
<p>brakes i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>panic when my car</p>
<p>starts sliding yeah you know</p>
<p>because yeah i</p>
<p>throw papers out the window</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>i got a ton of accidents too</p>
<p>just growing up shit i must have</p>
<p>been in ten accidents by the time i was like twenty one</p>
<p>really from snow and ice and</p>
<p>everything snow and</p>
<p>ice and just being retarded</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it amazing here in la or</p>
<p>california even i</p>
<p>guess how people</p>
<p>react to rain they fucking</p>
<p>panic like really lose</p>
<p>their mind no no idea how to</p>
<p>drive no idea that</p>
<p>well not only that it gets</p>
<p>slippery as fuck when the rain</p>
<p>first starts</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t realize this</p>
<p>especially if you have shitty tires and shitty brakes</p>
<p>because the oil on the ground is</p>
<p>from driving and people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>engines leaking</p>
<p>it never gets</p>
<p>rinsed off like it does in a normal city yeah it</p>
<p>just builds up</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t rain here for like fucking</p>
<p>months and months</p>
<p>and months and</p>
<p>months so this</p>
<p>months of millions and millions of cars</p>
<p>every day going to the same spot drip drip drip drip</p>
<p>so oil gets</p>
<p>everywhere and as soon as it rains</p>
<p>the first couple</p>
<p>hours is dangerous as fuck</p>
<p>because that shit is just like ice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible people panic</p>
<p>people really</p>
<p>truly panic</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fucking people here that was</p>
<p>the number one reason why i wanted to</p>
<p>get out of california</p>
<p>moved to colorado</p>
<p>and the reason why i</p>
<p>moved to such a remote</p>
<p>place in the mountains</p>
<p>is i think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not healthy to be around this many people</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>these studies that they did with</p>
<p>rat population density studies</p>
<p>where they increase</p>
<p>the amount of rats in an area and they get fucking</p>
<p>crazy and start biting each other like</p>
<p>the reason why people don&rsquo;t like each</p>
<p>other as much is like what we talked</p>
<p>about before we&rsquo;re supposed to be in</p>
<p>groups small</p>
<p>groups where you know everybody</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>wired for like</p>
<p>150 you get a</p>
<p>place like la</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with 20 million people plus mexicans</p>
<p>nobody knows how many people there really are yeah</p>
<p>you know like they send me the</p>
<p>senses and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>get the fuck out of here with the</p>
<p>senses this is a joke yeah</p>
<p>you know how many mexicans i know</p>
<p>that are illegal i know a</p>
<p>ton of them oh yeah i know a</p>
<p>bunch of dudes i know dudes that i work out with i know</p>
<p>i know dudes at certain</p>
<p>stores that i go to</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s dudes that</p>
<p>run businesses they run</p>
<p>their own cash</p>
<p>businesses they&rsquo;re all mexicans and i know a</p>
<p>bunch of cooks</p>
<p>guys that work at this mexican restaurant that i go to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking awesome they&rsquo;re all illegals and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna answer that sentence</p>
<p>correctly yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna have the</p>
<p>right number on that</p>
<p>thing just shut up</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to tell</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to tell</p>
<p>this well the only way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna tell by the time they can tell</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be so far fucked with our</p>
<p>loss of privacy</p>
<p>i mean which is coming i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the next</p>
<p>stage there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some sort of a drastic</p>
<p>decrease in the amount of privacy that we have to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>either it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>because technology</p>
<p>brings this on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>technology that</p>
<p>is created is so</p>
<p>immense and powerful</p>
<p>that you really do have like an instant access to</p>
<p>where everyone is</p>
<p>sort of like google for your life</p>
<p>yeah you know like</p>
<p>we have with google now you have an instant access to</p>
<p>to any sort of question</p>
<p>you have on anything you can immediately find out</p>
<p>at least an</p>
<p>idea of what the argument is pro and con and then</p>
<p>start researching into it instantly</p>
<p>well eventually we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have something</p>
<p>along those lines</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to know how many people are here</p>
<p>who the people are</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to google</p>
<p>not even google but</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s not even on google</p>
<p>yeah like my next door neighbor the carpenter</p>
<p>or whatever the fuck he is</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about that guy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>about him in the news he&rsquo;s not a bad guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a criminal or anything like that sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to know</p>
<p>everything about him sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to know his birthday you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to know what his</p>
<p>childhood was like you</p>
<p>might be able</p>
<p>to you know</p>
<p>who knows and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna know that people will know</p>
<p>everything about you yeah</p>
<p>which is the really vulnerable feeling like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>you realize that like even now</p>
<p>things you do get</p>
<p>tracked you know yeah your credit card purchases</p>
<p>your surfing can be</p>
<p>how about when you ever use like yahoo</p>
<p>email or something like that</p>
<p>and you like you</p>
<p>you have like certain keywords and your</p>
<p>email and then i&rsquo;ll show you like ads in the</p>
<p>right house oh yeah</p>
<p>you have to do with like the</p>
<p>email that somebody sent you</p>
<p>yeah yeah what the fuck and</p>
<p>how much more is that gonna</p>
<p>how much better</p>
<p>or more like</p>
<p>invasive is that</p>
<p>gonna be it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be much more</p>
<p>you know what i mean we talked</p>
<p>about last week we talked about</p>
<p>smart dust it&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>technology that they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>these little tiny</p>
<p>things that are</p>
<p>literally the size of a</p>
<p>grain of sand</p>
<p>and they will have the ability to</p>
<p>transmit and receive data and they will have</p>
<p>their own power supply</p>
<p>what yeah and</p>
<p>hp is working on a</p>
<p>whole project</p>
<p>right now just google</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna talk</p>
<p>about it again but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in the idea and what it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>just google smartdust</p>
<p>fascinating and hp</p>
<p>is involved in it and this is there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put trillions of sensors</p>
<p>all over the world</p>
<p>trillions of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>so literally they&rsquo;ll be able to tell you like</p>
<p>where cars are parked</p>
<p>you know that this</p>
<p>house is on fire there&rsquo;ll be a grid</p>
<p>where people will have access to information</p>
<p>far beyond like the</p>
<p>reach that we have now i already</p>
<p>feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>upsetting that</p>
<p>i mean i think it&rsquo;s necessary in a way</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like it makes me uncomfortable that</p>
<p>so many places have cameras you know</p>
<p>yeah but look at how that helped</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying i know that it&rsquo;s a necessary</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sorry i had to walk away from the</p>
<p>microphone and get my note</p>
<p>back but did</p>
<p>that look at</p>
<p>how that worked in new york with that guy that</p>
<p>tried to blow up that car right tom</p>
<p>square and the</p>
<p>camera busted</p>
<p>him absolutely</p>
<p>but at the same time you go man like</p>
<p>cameras watching me</p>
<p>everywhere i go</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s like and then there&rsquo;s the tinfoil at</p>
<p>put that shit on you say well hey man</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s that car didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>bro blow up man</p>
<p>what they did was</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all black ops dude that&rsquo;s all fucking</p>
<p>co intel pro</p>
<p>what they do is you know alex</p>
<p>jones style you</p>
<p>well they do</p>
<p>basically the guy that is in that van</p>
<p>is working for the federal government</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen we have the</p>
<p>papers we have the documents</p>
<p>he works for the government</p>
<p>he sets up a</p>
<p>faulty bomb</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not scientific</p>
<p>it lights on fire</p>
<p>they arrest him they</p>
<p>get him they tell you they got him because of covert</p>
<p>video cameras</p>
<p>and they need to protect you</p>
<p>so to protect us</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna put</p>
<p>video cameras everywhere</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a scam</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lie it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>world order</p>
<p>did he really say all that</p>
<p>about this i</p>
<p>just made up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he</p>
<p>would say yeah</p>
<p>yeah that was really good</p>
<p>so i can see his</p>
<p>point of view too</p>
<p>yeah that he</p>
<p>would say you know</p>
<p>um oh it&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>and you think that&rsquo;s nonsense you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the government</p>
<p>thinks i&rsquo;m not saying that they did that with this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying they</p>
<p>would do that though i</p>
<p>think with this guy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty documented this guy&rsquo;s a retard and you know</p>
<p>he was all upset at the world and</p>
<p>went to pakistan and met with the taliban</p>
<p>the whole deal</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s legitimately retarded and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not some sort of a</p>
<p>plant but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very possible</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that believe that</p>
<p>oklahoma city that the reason why oklahoma city was</p>
<p>blown up or was allowed to be</p>
<p>blown up was</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could pass new</p>
<p>stricter anti terrorism laws</p>
<p>yeah but here&rsquo;s my only problem with like</p>
<p>point of views like that right</p>
<p>and i mean like</p>
<p>with all of them when it&rsquo;s like a really</p>
<p>something that big is</p>
<p>the magnitude of the</p>
<p>conspiracy if it were to be true yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too big</p>
<p>you would have to have too many people keeping</p>
<p>secrets people</p>
<p>are naturally reluctant to keep</p>
<p>secrets for the most part</p>
<p>when you have people</p>
<p>have like a compulsion</p>
<p>to wanna share</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not supposed to share</p>
<p>that is true so it&rsquo;s like if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>that big you have to have literally</p>
<p>there have to be hundreds of people almost you</p>
<p>mean oklahoma city</p>
<p>yeah oklahoma city well</p>
<p>you know but just to play</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s advocate do you know that</p>
<p>the fbi removed several undetonated bombs outside the</p>
<p>building they pulled them out of the building</p>
<p>after it happened</p>
<p>and this is reported on the news in oklahoma</p>
<p>and that the bomb itself that they made at a</p>
<p>fertilizer that</p>
<p>literally like if you look at the evidence like how the</p>
<p>building was blown up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way a</p>
<p>fertilizer bomb did that kind of damage</p>
<p>not only that the</p>
<p>building blew outward it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blow from the center down there wasn&rsquo;t like a big</p>
<p>crater underneath the truck</p>
<p>and the idea is that there were bombs inside the</p>
<p>building and that this guy who</p>
<p>blew up this bomb</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>truck bomb yeah he blew up a</p>
<p>truck bomb but that&rsquo;s not responsible</p>
<p>for all that damage the idea is that the damage</p>
<p>was done by a</p>
<p>bunch of bombs that were inside the</p>
<p>building and all of them didn&rsquo;t go off and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why the fbi pulled them out of the</p>
<p>building pulled</p>
<p>unexploded ones out of the</p>
<p>building and that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the government was involved</p>
<p>what it could have mean was that</p>
<p>he was working with</p>
<p>other people and not only did he have this</p>
<p>fertilizer bomb</p>
<p>but he had these</p>
<p>other bombs in the</p>
<p>building and</p>
<p>maybe his fertilizer</p>
<p>bomb was supposed to detonate</p>
<p>those other bombs and blow up the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different possibilities of it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very rarely talked</p>
<p>about and the footage of</p>
<p>all these different people that were involved all</p>
<p>these different fucking</p>
<p>muslim guys that were supposed to be there that had</p>
<p>worked for saddam</p>
<p>hussein and iraq and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>various organizations</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tricky little story</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>start looking into it you say well that still</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s some sort of a conspiracy</p>
<p>absolutely it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done shit in the past</p>
<p>and when you look at the</p>
<p>stuff that the government has done that</p>
<p>would require hundreds of people to keep</p>
<p>their mouths shut</p>
<p>like do you know</p>
<p>about the gulf of tonkin</p>
<p>do you know about that</p>
<p>is that the vietnam</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fake attack that</p>
<p>has been proven now</p>
<p>and this is something that they did</p>
<p>to get us into the vietnam war so they did that</p>
<p>and they got away with it i mean we went through</p>
<p>the vietnam war</p>
<p>the operation</p>
<p>northwoods is another one and we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this on the podcast before</p>
<p>but for those people who</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard this google operation</p>
<p>northwoods what operation</p>
<p>northwoods is</p>
<p>was a plan that was</p>
<p>drafted by the joint chiefs of</p>
<p>staff in 1962</p>
<p>and vetoed by kennedy it was signed by the joint</p>
<p>chiefs of staff</p>
<p>and the plan was to attack american</p>
<p>civilians and</p>
<p>blame it on the cubans</p>
<p>so we would go to war with cuba that&rsquo;s pretty they were</p>
<p>gonna blow up a jet</p>
<p>that was part of the idea they were</p>
<p>gonna blow up a jet and pull the people out of the jet</p>
<p>fly the jet and then move the people to another</p>
<p>plane but then they were</p>
<p>gonna blow the jet up and</p>
<p>say all these people died</p>
<p>really yeah this was 1962</p>
<p>this is a plot by the joint</p>
<p>chiefs of staff</p>
<p>not only did they</p>
<p>say that they were gonna</p>
<p>bomb guantanamo bay they were lob mortars</p>
<p>on guantanamo bay and assume</p>
<p>civilian or</p>
<p>military casualties</p>
<p>so they were</p>
<p>gonna kill american military</p>
<p>to blame it on the cubans</p>
<p>so that people</p>
<p>would get all fired up</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done shit like that before yeah no</p>
<p>you start talking</p>
<p>about conspiracies</p>
<p>the real problem is when you get into them and you</p>
<p>start researching them you go</p>
<p>fuck look at all the shit they have done yeah no you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right and then and i don&rsquo;t and i don&rsquo;t say like that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>that the government or anybody for that matter</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to be that</p>
<p>morally corrupt or evil right my</p>
<p>just my natural</p>
<p>like inclination is to be like when</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>start to get</p>
<p>really massive</p>
<p>is to go like</p>
<p>how can we how in this day and</p>
<p>age especially</p>
<p>can that secret be kept</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>one way that it&rsquo;s kept if you</p>
<p>put your tinfoil</p>
<p>hat on tight</p>
<p>one way it&rsquo;s kept is by</p>
<p>putting out</p>
<p>information that&rsquo;s correct and mixing it with a</p>
<p>bunch of stuff that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>process disinformation what they do is they attach</p>
<p>all these legitimate ideas</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s so outrageous</p>
<p>that it makes the</p>
<p>legitimate ideas seem</p>
<p>ridiculous because they&rsquo;re connected to them</p>
<p>right but by relationship okay you</p>
<p>know and that&rsquo;s a strategy that is</p>
<p>well documented you know</p>
<p>if you look at</p>
<p>in the 1950s the cia</p>
<p>wrote papers</p>
<p>about this kind of stuff</p>
<p>you know cointelpro</p>
<p>and the idea that you know you have to</p>
<p>you know put out</p>
<p>dumb stories</p>
<p>that attach themselves to the real</p>
<p>story so it makes it ridiculous</p>
<p>i mean people have have actually had jobs</p>
<p>where there are disinformation</p>
<p>agents and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hired to go on blogs and websites this is</p>
<p>is going on</p>
<p>right now this is like real shit</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re hired to</p>
<p>argue certain points</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hired to</p>
<p>stand up for government ideas and offer</p>
<p>very well thought out</p>
<p>arguments and they do it</p>
<p>under these anonymous assumed names</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s several people</p>
<p>these are real government jobs that actually exist</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been proven it&rsquo;s been talked about</p>
<p>we find the shit that the government has done</p>
<p>and it makes</p>
<p>you go fuck what have they done that i don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be pretty elaborate</p>
<p>and pretty crazy yeah</p>
<p>but sees that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the argument of 100 people</p>
<p>would have to be in on the secret</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>the reason why it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work is because they have been</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s been a lot of</p>
<p>secrets that</p>
<p>were processed that</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t find out about</p>
<p>the operation</p>
<p>midnight climax is another one we&rsquo;ve talked on the show</p>
<p>about before</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the 1950s the government</p>
<p>ran the cia</p>
<p>ran brothels</p>
<p>in new york and in san francisco</p>
<p>and they dosed people with lsd</p>
<p>they had johns</p>
<p>would come in and they</p>
<p>would try to get</p>
<p>lay these poor fucks</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>blast them with acid</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re in there trying to get</p>
<p>their freak on that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny they did it because they wanted to test the</p>
<p>effects of lsd</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t find willing patients anymore</p>
<p>you know a few people did it and</p>
<p>you know they fucking dose people man they&rsquo;ve given you</p>
<p>like a little bit they&rsquo;re giving you like</p>
<p>mad doses to</p>
<p>see what happened when they did the original</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the famous one</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>gonna see if it</p>
<p>could be like a</p>
<p>truth serum</p>
<p>where the cia</p>
<p>had they killed people</p>
<p>they accidentally killed one of</p>
<p>their own agents</p>
<p>yeah they gave him too much and he fucking like</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t know what kind of</p>
<p>dosages they were just like really have another little</p>
<p>you know tablet</p>
<p>he fucking he lost his he</p>
<p>he died well it makes</p>
<p>sense that they</p>
<p>that that would be possible because if you</p>
<p>think about like</p>
<p>experiments</p>
<p>you know they didn&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>we had like a</p>
<p>whole database on</p>
<p>lsd experience</p>
<p>know that we</p>
<p>could pull from like hey don&rsquo;t do more than</p>
<p>this amount</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fucking blow your because your own</p>
<p>chemistry is also different from the next person yeah</p>
<p>yeah like alcohol like some dudes can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink it all</p>
<p>other dudes can just</p>
<p>drink and somehow another don&rsquo;t even get</p>
<p>drunk yeah weird</p>
<p>like an old like some guys just</p>
<p>pound it to</p>
<p>all day and some dudes do that with acid</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some dudes that</p>
<p>gobble that shit</p>
<p>up and take like fucking five six tabs and they&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>yeah and they seem to like be better and then</p>
<p>other dudes they they get a high dose and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never the same</p>
<p>again i know</p>
<p>a guy like that yeah yeah i know a guy like that</p>
<p>who is it what&rsquo;s his name i can&rsquo;t say his name</p>
<p>what happened what happened</p>
<p>he took he took a</p>
<p>he took a dose</p>
<p>this is like you know uh</p>
<p>like fifteen no</p>
<p>thirteen years ago</p>
<p>about whoa and that was it huh</p>
<p>that was it dude</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>he you know he was</p>
<p>chilling he was in college and just</p>
<p>partying just like doing regular</p>
<p>like you know drinking</p>
<p>what was the effect</p>
<p>he he did i</p>
<p>think he took it like let&rsquo;s say like on a friday yeah</p>
<p>and everything</p>
<p>you know that it seemingly wore off like the way</p>
<p>any like you know when you</p>
<p>do drugs with wood</p>
<p>and then he was he went</p>
<p>like the next week</p>
<p>went into like the</p>
<p>like the school and</p>
<p>walked through like the cafeteria</p>
<p>went into the</p>
<p>kitchen and</p>
<p>started like</p>
<p>like asking the asking the chef to like</p>
<p>if if he could swim in the</p>
<p>water supply</p>
<p>like like from the sink</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s like can i go into into the pipes</p>
<p>whoa and they were just like huh like</p>
<p>what are you doing back here can i go</p>
<p>into the pipes and swim to the water</p>
<p>supply yeah and they were like whoa</p>
<p>so then it was like we</p>
<p>check this kid out and then they</p>
<p>should let him try</p>
<p>maybe he could to this day though he&rsquo;s you know like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s off</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s able to work and</p>
<p>do that but he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the same guy that he was</p>
<p>fuck something happened</p>
<p>some shit was</p>
<p>disconnected</p>
<p>what was he like before and what does he like now</p>
<p>before he was like</p>
<p>like i would say like a thoughtful</p>
<p>you know pretty</p>
<p>articulate reserved</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s like quirky</p>
<p>and like a little more like like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like artsy like a</p>
<p>kind of an artsy guy right</p>
<p>but like peculiar like it like would</p>
<p>says things that like don&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>you know and so you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s like a percentage insane like what yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah i would</p>
<p>say now and and more inclined like you you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i could see</p>
<p>something else happening</p>
<p>where you would go and</p>
<p>you know i mean like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re walking something went</p>
<p>wrong you&rsquo;re on the edge right now</p>
<p>right like your bet you know you</p>
<p>could i could see you falling in the tank pretty</p>
<p>pretty soon the</p>
<p>crazy tank the crazy tank</p>
<p>but before that</p>
<p>there was no evidence of that at all zero</p>
<p>zero it was totally normal</p>
<p>as far as i knew and i knew him like i</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t good good friends but i knew him fairly well</p>
<p>the mat radical change</p>
<p>radical change</p>
<p>i believe it dude i believe it just because of</p>
<p>i hadn&rsquo;t experienced</p>
<p>one of the last times i did dmt the last time i did dmt</p>
<p>where it was</p>
<p>a few years ago</p>
<p>where for like two weeks</p>
<p>after i did it</p>
<p>i this way i</p>
<p>was describe it it&rsquo;s very difficult to describe</p>
<p>but i say that reality got very slippery</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like reality</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>i could bang on it</p>
<p>really anymore yeah it seemed</p>
<p>like it seemed like</p>
<p>the the dmt</p>
<p>experience is so</p>
<p>powerful and so</p>
<p>incredibly beautiful and overwhelming and shocking</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re doing it it seems more real than</p>
<p>reality itself</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking a look into a better</p>
<p>more pure efficient</p>
<p>next stage reality it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re taking this look into what&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>afterlife type of</p>
<p>experience i mean that&rsquo;s really what it feels like</p>
<p>and then i would come back</p>
<p>or i did come back</p>
<p>from it and then for a couple weeks this life</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like it was</p>
<p>gonna hold up</p>
<p>it felt like all this shit that i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>everything around me it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming that this is real</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>that this is hard and this is reality and this is life</p>
<p>but after doing the dmt</p>
<p>experience like that seems</p>
<p>so much more real than reality so what the fuck is this</p>
<p>you know and then i</p>
<p>started yeah yeah i</p>
<p>started getting these</p>
<p>weird ideas</p>
<p>about like the</p>
<p>structure of life</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>the pattern</p>
<p>of human existence and</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on on the planet at the same time</p>
<p>that it was really like much less</p>
<p>tangible much less real</p>
<p>than i thought it was and that perhaps the the</p>
<p>sleeping time when your</p>
<p>brain is producing dmt</p>
<p>you know like when you&rsquo;re in heavy rem</p>
<p>sleep that that</p>
<p>might be just a much more intense</p>
<p>version of life that we only get like in</p>
<p>small doses that</p>
<p>might be real life and this</p>
<p>might be the</p>
<p>crazy dream and</p>
<p>sounds banana</p>
<p>poop i almost said it</p>
<p>sounds fucking</p>
<p>crazy yeah yeah and um</p>
<p>and rightly so but</p>
<p>what are the alternatives i mean the alternative is</p>
<p>any anytime you</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about what what life</p>
<p>could be or what drugs</p>
<p>could be or what hallucinations really mean</p>
<p>you open yourself up to ridicule</p>
<p>rightly so because most of the time when you talk</p>
<p>about the subjects they</p>
<p>sounds ridiculous</p>
<p>but what is the alternative</p>
<p>well the alternative is that we&rsquo;re just this</p>
<p>biological fleshy</p>
<p>thing that lives</p>
<p>for 65 years</p>
<p>then you fucking die and you move on and you</p>
<p>breed while you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>and eventually there&rsquo;ll be too many of us will blow the</p>
<p>world up cause there&rsquo;s too many of us</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s the alternative yeah</p>
<p>know and that this</p>
<p>nothing means anything and you</p>
<p>know there is no purpose for any of this unlike</p>
<p>everything else in nature i mean</p>
<p>everything else in nature is</p>
<p>building something</p>
<p>supplying to something</p>
<p>you know a part of an ecosystem</p>
<p>has a very vital vital</p>
<p>part in the</p>
<p>whole process the natural process of life</p>
<p>everything that we see</p>
<p>from volcanoes and fires and predators and prey</p>
<p>all seems to fit into this entire</p>
<p>system that</p>
<p>except for human beings</p>
<p>you know except for how we view our life but i think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just a really advanced form of all that shit</p>
<p>and that what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>in this life</p>
<p>is setting us up somehow or another for the next</p>
<p>stage of existence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why every single</p>
<p>culture has had this idea of heaven</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>culture has had this idea of a better</p>
<p>place that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>know somewhere</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna be more pure</p>
<p>or you know there</p>
<p>would be all love or be</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these different various versions of it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a part of us instinctively that</p>
<p>understands</p>
<p>that this is a stage</p>
<p>and that like</p>
<p>everything else in the</p>
<p>universe from the big bang to the formation of stars to</p>
<p>the formation of planets to life forming on planets to</p>
<p>life evolving and getting more advanced</p>
<p>that it all</p>
<p>keeps moving on towards some new better more improved</p>
<p>more advanced</p>
<p>thing and that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen to us too</p>
<p>do you wait but does your did your</p>
<p>did that last the empty</p>
<p>experience though</p>
<p>like that was last</p>
<p>time you did it that was last time i did it did it just</p>
<p>did your experience</p>
<p>afterwards also kind of make you go</p>
<p>well maybe i</p>
<p>should do dmt more</p>
<p>or no no i think</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing the reason why i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it</p>
<p>since then is because i</p>
<p>still i still</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>trying to exactly process</p>
<p>like honestly process what happened like i</p>
<p>could do it now again</p>
<p>i might be willing to do it now</p>
<p>again if i had some</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just as</p>
<p>important to try to honestly process what happened in</p>
<p>the last experience to try to</p>
<p>learn as much from it as you can</p>
<p>you know one of the</p>
<p>things that you do</p>
<p>experience when you have any like really extreme</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience you</p>
<p>experience this complete dissolving of your ego</p>
<p>everything like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built yourself up to be</p>
<p>everything your</p>
<p>language the way you talk you know your social</p>
<p>structure how you fit in with</p>
<p>your friends and your family and your dog and all that</p>
<p>stuff your self</p>
<p>definition all dissolves</p>
<p>everything dissolves</p>
<p>your definition of the</p>
<p>world of earth of</p>
<p>human beings all that dissolves too</p>
<p>and you start to look at</p>
<p>things in this almost like this</p>
<p>alien perspective</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re taking mushrooms it feels like</p>
<p>and even dmt it feels like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at the universe through the eyes of an</p>
<p>alien of like a</p>
<p>super advanced</p>
<p>organic life form that&rsquo;s far far far</p>
<p>evolved from</p>
<p>where we are at this</p>
<p>point in time and you get to see the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>objectively and</p>
<p>clearly without the context of any of the</p>
<p>things you already</p>
<p>understand and know</p>
<p>about it like</p>
<p>language and accents</p>
<p>and you know jobs and all that bullshit you start</p>
<p>you see it all</p>
<p>like in some</p>
<p>weird sort of a way but when you do that the problem is</p>
<p>especially if you have a</p>
<p>crazy dose a</p>
<p>crazy dmt sort of trip</p>
<p>the real problem</p>
<p>is reassimilating back into the regular world</p>
<p>the real problem is</p>
<p>like being around like regular people and</p>
<p>mundane shit</p>
<p>and try to take it all seriously and try to</p>
<p>focus on all the</p>
<p>stuff that you do you know</p>
<p>you know you do like have to do as</p>
<p>well yeah that&rsquo;s like i would say</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences are useless if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring something back</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn something that you can</p>
<p>apply to this</p>
<p>world because this is the</p>
<p>world where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending most of your time</p>
<p>yeah you know yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true yeah and</p>
<p>your most of your time is</p>
<p>spent in the waking world</p>
<p>you know so if you&rsquo;re having these</p>
<p>psychedelic trips and that&rsquo;s what you really</p>
<p>enjoy out of life it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>enjoying you know</p>
<p>these experiences and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>enjoying the regular</p>
<p>world at all</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>bringing anything back with you you can</p>
<p>go and have</p>
<p>these experiences and</p>
<p>bring something back with you and change</p>
<p>the world around you and make it better</p>
<p>like that is possible or</p>
<p>you could take too much and go fucking bonkers and</p>
<p>try to swim in the pipes</p>
<p>to jump in the pipes</p>
<p>and get to the</p>
<p>water supply i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never fucked with acid</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into</p>
<p>doing anything that people create you know i did</p>
<p>mdma once i did</p>
<p>ecstasy once</p>
<p>and i got really fucked up and the next day my</p>
<p>brain was just useless</p>
<p>yeah and i think i</p>
<p>learned from that</p>
<p>experience i</p>
<p>enjoyed the</p>
<p>experience of being on</p>
<p>ecstasy but the come down</p>
<p>was just way too brutal i was</p>
<p>like this is not good for you</p>
<p>i think shit like chemicals that man made</p>
<p>stuff that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in nature that</p>
<p>or you know lsd sort of does and yeah</p>
<p>hawaiian baby woodrow</p>
<p>seeds and some some other</p>
<p>things you can actually give a</p>
<p>distract ghb</p>
<p>no i heard that&rsquo;s bought fucking</p>
<p>i heard that shit is</p>
<p>really dangerous</p>
<p>i i indeed i was in a coma</p>
<p>really yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah what happened i i took</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>happened so it&rsquo;s so dumb when i did</p>
<p>i took i took</p>
<p>ecstasy and then</p>
<p>i was having some drinks</p>
<p>like i probably had like four five drinks</p>
<p>which is you</p>
<p>know like liquor great</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>i was like i don&rsquo;t feel this</p>
<p>ecstasy at all</p>
<p>and this guy how</p>
<p>old are you by the way i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>freshman in college so 18 19</p>
<p>so then he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a gallon of ghb</p>
<p>in the back</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re supposed to take</p>
<p>like if you take a cap</p>
<p>if you take</p>
<p>like a water cap yeah that&rsquo;s what we did we</p>
<p>would take it like this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d pour it into that</p>
<p>and just that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it and then that&rsquo;s it yeah well he has a milk jug</p>
<p>so he gives it to me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like he&rsquo;s like here just take a swig well and</p>
<p>when i look back on it i realized what i did to</p>
<p>it it was just like out of like not wanting to be rude</p>
<p>basically like</p>
<p>politeness almost killed me</p>
<p>is that i open it and i can&rsquo;t you couldn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>heavy to like</p>
<p>you know a milk</p>
<p>jug just as like a thin little cap</p>
<p>right right you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fill it so you&rsquo;re trying to like well how much</p>

<p>has a fucking milk jug of</p>
<p>ghb around this</p>
<p>house yeah man and then</p>
<p>i fucking continue</p>
<p>drinking and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing about ghb</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re not supposed to have any alcohol with it</p>
<p>like not even a</p>
<p>drink so you</p>
<p>blackout you go into a coma yeah</p>

<p>and just like</p>
<p>right like why we</p>
<p>should hang out man like</p>

<p>never fucked with that</p>
<p>stuff i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>fucked with cocaine</p>
<p>heroin here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing too about</p>
<p>ghb is that</p>
<p>in its real natural form</p>
<p>like in what it really is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know it can be</p>
<p>regulated it&rsquo;s used like as an anesthetic</p>
<p>in like parts of europe</p>
<p>but when you buy it from like</p>
<p>street level people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously it&rsquo;s fucked with like</p>
<p>right people will</p>
<p>spike it with anything</p>
<p>well even if they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spike it you</p>
<p>drank so much of it</p>
<p>right oh yeah yeah i</p>
<p>would have been fucked with if</p>
<p>they used to sell that shit at gnc yeah yeah</p>
<p>right it used to be for bodybuilding for bodybuilder</p>
<p>cover and that was kind of the</p>
<p>thing like when you</p>
<p>when we started like i used to</p>
<p>sample it and stuff</p>
<p>you would use dudes</p>
<p>it was under the guise</p>
<p>of like wow i&rsquo;m lifting weights like</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta gotta fucking get strong</p>
<p>you fucked up i&rsquo;m lifting</p>
<p>weights lifting</p>
<p>weights oh that&rsquo;s hilarious man</p>
<p>i wanted to talk</p>
<p>about a couple</p>
<p>things that i saw on the news</p>
<p>today just cause there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>ridiculous shit</p>
<p>speaking of lifting weights</p>
<p>and the university of</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>study somebody put this on the rogan</p>
<p>board my message board</p>
<p>ash put it up there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing this study on</p>
<p>shooting ultrasound</p>
<p>into people&rsquo;s balls</p>
<p>what to act as</p>
<p>a birth control and</p>
<p>a reversible birth control for men</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll shoot a burst of ultrasound into your ball sack</p>
<p>and and blast all your spermies</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re just shooting blanks for like six months</p>
<p>why would wait what is the point of this</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to make babies</p>
<p>that sounds horrifying man</p>
<p>sounds ridiculous</p>
<p>that you would</p>
<p>trust them like you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna kill my loads</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll come back in six months</p>
<p>and then what happens</p>
<p>after those six months i make fucking radioactive</p>
<p>babies yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna what kind of shit is that what what are</p>
<p>those babies gonna look like</p>
<p>could you imagine if like a five and a half months</p>
<p>when your shit</p>
<p>supposed to be like not come back yet yeah</p>
<p>you shoot around at</p>
<p>some chick and you make some fucking nuclear baby yeah</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>again whoa it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like the six</p>
<p>armed baby yeah</p>
<p>oh my god that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be shiva</p>
<p>yeah it will come out</p>
<p>on fucking fire with a</p>
<p>crazy headdress and shit and then</p>
<p>doctors would be like huh</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>i mean come on</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>all the autistic kids</p>
<p>that are being created</p>
<p>today and all the thoughts of like</p>
<p>where this is coming</p>
<p>from whether it&rsquo;s environmental or chemicals or yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of theories vaccinations people being</p>
<p>older and having the kids</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>older and their dna is damaged</p>
<p>how about the</p>
<p>babies that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have when they are</p>
<p>shooting ultrasound into your</p>
<p>fucking sack when you have like</p>
<p>radio waves yeah</p>
<p>no you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i would still just pull out before</p>
<p>i allowed well you know that&rsquo;s how my</p>
<p>first daughter was born</p>
<p>pull out method</p>
<p>hello yeah i did a bit</p>
<p>about it on my last special</p>
<p>totally true</p>
<p>pulling out don&rsquo;t work man pre ejaculate</p>
<p>is like there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>swimmer that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right i do remember that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>boys in there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fucking they&rsquo;ll get the job done the</p>
<p>green beret</p>
<p>loads yeah yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right the green</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>you can make</p>
<p>you can make a baby for sure without coming inside a</p>
<p>chick it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it kind of makes you go</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe it didn&rsquo;t happen so many times</p>
<p>yeah definitely</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that common i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s probably pretty hard to do but it</p>
<p>still possible to do you know it really is yeah</p>
<p>green berets</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re really like that</p>
<p>how many times you like</p>
<p>squeezing it what you hope and nuns coming out but</p>
<p>a little few guys</p>
<p>might have popped out or how about</p>
<p>not even pre</p>
<p>com that&rsquo;s like a tiny com oh yeah like a little</p>
<p>like a flex when he was like</p>
<p>yeah just a little bit yeah</p>
<p>yeah you feel a little just a</p>
<p>twitch and you try to hold it in there</p>
<p>yeah yeah well</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to come</p>
<p>up with all sorts of different ways and you know with</p>
<p>women it&rsquo;s all hormonal</p>
<p>they can either</p>
<p>shoot you up with something that makes your body</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>or they give you a pill that makes your body</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>or they put a</p>
<p>catcher&rsquo;s mitt in there like put an iud and they</p>
<p>sort that shit in your</p>
<p>snatch and it gets all infected and</p>
<p>and your loads you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>shoot at it makes barnacles on a fucking dock</p>
<p>you know yeah that thought of that one</p>
<p>that makes me uncomfortable</p>
<p>imagine if they pull it out and there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>stalagmites from your old loads</p>
<p>that have been trying to</p>
<p>get into this</p>
<p>iud and they</p>
<p>just hang out there it&rsquo;s all crusty with your old loads</p>

<p>applied that data to my view of the</p>
<p>world i don&rsquo;t have to see more and more evidence of it</p>
<p>i know that there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>extreme examples of fucked up shit out there yeah</p>
<p>especially going online and just</p>
<p>going online changes your</p>
<p>whole fucking view of the</p>
<p>world yeah people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go online can you imagine how dumb our parents were</p>
<p>much less they knew</p>
<p>about the big</p>
<p>picture oh yeah what&rsquo;s possible no</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s why if you if you try to tell them</p>
<p>like a lot of times</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even have to be something too outrageous yeah</p>
<p>i hear that i just your</p>
<p>obama would</p>
<p>obama said he was talking about fucking</p>
<p>ipods and xbox</p>
<p>x yeah and ipads and xbox</p>
<p>none of which i know how to use oh</p>
<p>yeah you know i hate all that</p>
<p>first of all i hate all that none of</p>
<p>which i know how to use what he was saying that</p>
<p>these things provide</p>
<p>information there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much information and it&rsquo;s difficult to discern</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s factual and what&rsquo;s not and that</p>
<p>crazy ideas can gain traction and become problematic</p>
<p>and he was saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually makes it hard on democracy</p>
<p>which i thought was hilarious</p>
<p>makes it hard to</p>
<p>run the country and it&rsquo;s bad for the country somewhere</p>
<p>and that line just appeals to a certain</p>
<p>generation when they</p>
<p>win yeah none of</p>
<p>which i know how to use this is what he says he says</p>
<p>ipads and xboxes and playstations none of</p>
<p>which i know how to use</p>
<p>my fucking two year old</p>
<p>daughter knows how to use an ipod dude</p>
<p>yeah she knows how to find the song she likes</p>
<p>click on it</p>
<p>she knows how</p>
<p>to go to the little apps and pick a little</p>
<p>monkey game and play the</p>
<p>monkey game</p>
<p>dude you know how to use a fucking ipod</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>stupid that&rsquo;s dumb and don&rsquo;t brag about</p>
<p>about being stupid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a silly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a goddamn harvard</p>
<p>graduate you&rsquo;re the president of the fucking united</p>
<p>states of america</p>
<p>right like you&rsquo;re dumb don&rsquo;t give us all that aw</p>
<p>shucks bullshit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>bunch of retards that always don&rsquo;t like you or</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re an elitist alright you</p>
<p>gotta accept that and just be yourself alright</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fuckin</p>
<p>pretend you don&rsquo;t know how to work an ipod man</p>
<p>just stop i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gross i agree</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking dumb man</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the whole it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s putting on an act it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>comic that we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about comics that are disingenuous yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s a phony thing</p>
<p>yeah so anyway</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to say that</p>
<p>somehow or another</p>
<p>all this access to information that people have now</p>
<p>the problem is that</p>
<p>these crazy ideas can gain traction</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>becomes more of a distraction than it is a useless</p>
<p>you know source of information but that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>so who&rsquo;s the use</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the useful source of information</p>
<p>how come there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much shit that&rsquo;s in the news that we don&rsquo;t hear about</p>
<p>how come we have to go online to find out like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>liberia to get real information</p>
<p>about the fucking oil</p>
<p>spill in the gulf</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not getting that shit from the network</p>
<p>news you&rsquo;re not getting that shit from the newspapers</p>
<p>you gotta really see the images and the</p>
<p>videos online</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video online</p>
<p>right now this guy</p>
<p>flew a plane</p>
<p>over the gulf</p>
<p>oil spill and</p>
<p>videotaped the</p>
<p>whole thing and put it up and showed</p>
<p>how massive it is and how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being honest</p>
<p>about what a catastrophe it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>shocking it&rsquo;s on my twitter you</p>
<p>can go to my twitter feed go to joe rogan on twitter</p>
<p>and just just my name it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not dot net anymore it&rsquo;s just my name i got that back</p>
<p>so if you go to my</p>
<p>twitter feed it&rsquo;s like one or two twitters ago i put it</p>
<p>watch that video and</p>
<p>freak the fuck out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s horrifying</p>
<p>looking at this gigantic fucking</p>
<p>thing of oil in the middle of the ocean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hearing</p>
<p>about that from the news they&rsquo;re recognizing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a big deal but they&rsquo;re not showing you</p>
<p>10 minutes of footage</p>
<p>so you can really get a good idea of it you</p>
<p>gotta look online yeah</p>
<p>i mean to find out like shit like operation</p>
<p>north woods or any of</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t getting discussed in the newspaper</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t getting discussed</p>
<p>in the news people are hiding this kind of information</p>
<p>big gigantic corporations</p>
<p>control network news they control the newspapers</p>
<p>they control</p>
<p>ge controls nbc and</p>
<p>fox news is owned by rupert murdoch</p>
<p>and you know the abcs disney</p>
<p>yeah i mean these are</p>
<p>giant fucking corporations</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give you all the news you need</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>these bloggers and</p>
<p>these people that are like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not less</p>
<p>less informative they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not like like less reliable they&rsquo;re people that easily</p>
<p>could be working for nbc or cbs</p>
<p>or abc two they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>journalists</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just a new version of</p>
<p>journalist that does shit online</p>
<p>and yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some people that are irreparable but then</p>
<p>their reputation is that they suck</p>
<p>you know when someone</p>
<p>online you know</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s been proven by a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>websites this guy puts out bad information</p>
<p>then they become discredited</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like a natural process</p>
<p>yeah and for</p>
<p>obama to say that that&rsquo;s not the case</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s something bad</p>
<p>about all this new access to information</p>
<p>that just shows me two</p>
<p>things one he&rsquo;s full</p>
<p>of shit and two they&rsquo;re dealing with a lot of pressure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting jacked left and</p>
<p>right about all sorts of things</p>
<p>like a video out</p>
<p>right now of him</p>
<p>on the campaign</p>
<p>trail talking</p>
<p>about no bid contracts yeah</p>
<p>like haliburton and shit like that he just fucking gave</p>
<p>haliburton some grunt giant</p>
<p>five hundred million dollar no</p>
<p>bid contract</p>
<p>his whole fucking platform</p>
<p>was that he was</p>
<p>gonna end no</p>
<p>bid contract yep</p>
<p>they just doesn&rsquo;t does it yeah</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s oh no more</p>
<p>lobbyists me</p>
<p>only hires a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>i mean though</p>
<p>the whole idea behind</p>
<p>being a president</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be some sort of a leader and what you promise us is</p>
<p>supposed to be something that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>when you get in office you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna change shit you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make it better</p>
<p>but no one does nobody does</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the craziest hustle ever</p>
<p>but the thing that i</p>
<p>think nobody ever</p>
<p>admits is that neither side ever does ever like ever</p>
<p>right the republic no good</p>
<p>get criticized by the democrats when they do certain</p>
<p>things but once the democrats get in office like the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not nearly as many people criticizing</p>
<p>obama for sending</p>
<p>thirty thousand</p>
<p>troops over to afghanistan</p>
<p>after winning the nobel</p>
<p>prize not nearly as many</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re criticizing</p>
<p>george bush of course not nearly yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>spokesperson cause</p>
<p>both sides are</p>
<p>completely full of shit</p>
<p>do you think that they&rsquo;re full of shit</p>
<p>or do you think they</p>
<p>say whatever the fuck they have to say to get the job</p>
<p>and then once</p>
<p>they get the job they realize that they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a say they&rsquo;re not the ones</p>
<p>who get to dictate policy</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s that and it&rsquo;s also that the game itself</p>
<p>of politics is so already</p>
<p>dictated for</p>
<p>you we have this idea that like</p>
<p>we can elect somebody like</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>obama like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna actually the</p>
<p>system will change like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a certain way and no more like</p>
<p>spinning stuff but you realize that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already laid out</p>
<p>there is there&rsquo;s a spin</p>
<p>thing in a it&rsquo;s a job it&rsquo;s a job it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s you really is like being a prospe</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>spokesperson it is and and there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>distortions of</p>
<p>truth and manipulations and lies</p>
<p>no matter who gets it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too big of a</p>
<p>thing and there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much too many people that you</p>
<p>would have to try to please</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be impossible</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way it is people are</p>
<p>going to lie</p>
<p>and no matter who is in the office</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter who the real problem is that</p>
<p>corporate if you ever seen like</p>
<p>movies on corporations</p>
<p>you know like that</p>
<p>especially the document</p>
<p>the documentary the corporation</p>
<p>where they talk</p>
<p>about like a corporation as like a sociopath they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry at all</p>
<p>about there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>basically concentrate on</p>
<p>what sociopaths</p>
<p>do is very similar to what corporations do</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about who their actions hurt</p>
<p>and that being in a corporation is sort of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a diffusion</p>
<p>of responsibility because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>other people that are doing the same thing</p>
<p>you know and i wonder like when</p>
<p>when you get a guy like obama</p>
<p>i wonder if they</p>
<p>start out with the</p>
<p>right intentions and they</p>
<p>start out really</p>
<p>thinking that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make a change</p>
<p>but once they</p>
<p>get in office you know once they get in there</p>
<p>maybe then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like they realize like you know like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to change shit you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you really that&rsquo;s what they change a few social things</p>
<p>yeah like it</p>
<p>changed like the gay marriage</p>
<p>thing yeah like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting rid of don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to say that you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s also like the medical marijuana</p>
<p>thing they said that they&rsquo;re not gonna go</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>gonna go after</p>
<p>the dea will only go</p>
<p>after medical marijuana dispensaries that violate both</p>
<p>state and federal law</p>
<p>so the federal law</p>
<p>is all marijuana is illegal the</p>
<p>state law is very</p>
<p>clearly defined what you&rsquo;re allowed to do medically</p>
<p>and a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t operate within</p>
<p>those parameters and they</p>
<p>sell a bunch of shit to people that don&rsquo;t have licenses</p>
<p>so the idea was they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go after</p>
<p>those people you know</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>things that do change</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what they hang</p>
<p>their hat on like but</p>
<p>are those things that do change</p>
<p>are they because</p>
<p>they have to give something</p>
<p>otherwise people will fucking</p>
<p>just rage up</p>
<p>you know do they</p>
<p>like give you a little just to keep democracy intact</p>
<p>and just resist</p>
<p>the change as much as possible</p>
<p>resist giving</p>
<p>the people what they want as much as possible</p>
<p>is it consciously thought out</p>
<p>i i think i</p>
<p>think the way that the</p>
<p>system is set</p>
<p>up is that this is what bothers me the most</p>
<p>about politics</p>
<p>is for some reason</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to</p>
<p>admit fault in politics</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be like</p>
<p>i did something</p>
<p>this didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s set up and</p>
<p>that part that part is like</p>
<p>it is thought out</p>
<p>whatever decision you made</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to make it look like it was the</p>
<p>right decision</p>
<p>right definitely that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>never a mistake that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>major flaw in</p>
<p>in like the political</p>
<p>public system you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>admit to any flaws never</p>
<p>never if you do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna lose traction and you become a flip flopper</p>
<p>or whatever so it&rsquo;s always like what i did was the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>and that is meticulous obviously it&rsquo;s methodical</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very well you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s outlined it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking the most depressing thing</p>
<p>about it is the most depressing</p>
<p>thing about politics is that politics are real</p>
<p>you know and that you can you</p>
<p>could lose your fucking life paying attention to it</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>start talking like there&rsquo;s some new supreme</p>
<p>court justice nominee</p>
<p>that obama likes it looks like a</p>
<p>lesbian and everybody&rsquo;s all bummed out</p>
<p>about it and there&rsquo;s all this debate and like</p>
<p>god damn do i really have to fucking</p>
<p>think about this</p>
<p>do i really</p>
<p>have to when you do supposedly if you&rsquo;re a good</p>
<p>citizen you&rsquo;re supposed to pay attention because</p>
<p>lives could change and you know you</p>
<p>could be in a situation</p>
<p>where one of her rulings directly affects you yeah</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know</p>

<p>thing was the scars around his legs yeah</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s been doing this for a</p>
<p>while or his how about his</p>
<p>basically non reaction</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s happening</p>

<p>right yeah he didn&rsquo;t even buckle</p>
<p>homeboys got</p>

<p>yeah um but the</p>
<p>things that i don&rsquo;t like the most the</p>
<p>things that i can&rsquo;t react to</p>
<p>are like the</p>
<p>ultra real violent shit that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>stuff i&rsquo;m like i fucking can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>like crazy sexual</p>
<p>or whatever but like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m with you i don&rsquo;t like berg</p>
<p>the i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>decapitations and</p>
<p>shit man you know the conspiracy theory behind the nick</p>
<p>bird shit no that</p>
<p>those guys are not arabs that they&rsquo;re actually cia</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re americans</p>
<p>apparently their accents are off</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re too big</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>built like arabs</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like big bulky fat fucking beef eating</p>
<p>american psychos really and that&rsquo;s the the idea that</p>
<p>they they killed</p>
<p>a guy to make people more</p>
<p>excited they</p>
<p>found some guy over</p>
<p>there he&rsquo;s doing what he&rsquo;s not supposed to be doing</p>
<p>going to place</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s not supposed to be going</p>
<p>and so they jacked him arrested him</p>
<p>and cut his fucking head off so that</p>
<p>he could act as like a deterrent</p>
<p>for people that wanna</p>
<p>go and investigate this and he get people</p>
<p>enthusiastic</p>
<p>about this war like yeah we</p>
<p>gotta get these</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re evil</p>
<p>a big pr strategy man for a guy like that</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could take a</p>
<p>guy and use him as a tool like say if some guy</p>
<p>finds out some shit he&rsquo;s not supposed to find out or</p>
<p>go somewhere is not supposed to go and then</p>
<p>you know if he</p>
<p>could encourage</p>
<p>other people to do it they</p>
<p>could have a real problem</p>
<p>they just cut this guy&rsquo;s head off and make a</p>
<p>video out of it</p>
<p>and now not only will that shit</p>
<p>never happen</p>
<p>again nobody wants to go over there now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cutting your fucking head off and putting it on a</p>
<p>video yeah and you see that guy gag and</p>
<p>gurgle and make</p>
<p>those horrible</p>
<p>noises while he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>alive and they&rsquo;re sawing</p>
<p>through his fucking neck</p>
<p>you know and it gets people all</p>
<p>fired up about</p>
<p>going to war you</p>
<p>know in a war that&rsquo;s not a very popular war you know</p>
<p>you gotta be a cold like</p>
<p>i can under like i can see</p>
<p>in certain circumstances</p>
<p>you know how somebody kills somebody</p>
<p>like you know i mean i</p>
<p>understand that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>level that you</p>
<p>cross that like</p>
<p>you know somebody</p>
<p>could do something</p>
<p>where you could kill somebody</p>
<p>yeah i understand that like it&rsquo;s human</p>
<p>biologically you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna react</p>
<p>if somebody crosses</p>
<p>a certain line</p>
<p>where it happens</p>
<p>but to cut someone&rsquo;s head off you have to be a</p>
<p>savage motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>especially with a little</p>
<p>knife you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>using a fucking</p>
<p>axe yeah just</p>
<p>whoop you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going samurai</p>
<p>salon through it like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cutting through it you know i</p>
<p>guess man there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain amount of people that feel like</p>
<p>you know you have a goal</p>
<p>and you have a job</p>
<p>and you do that job and your objective is to fucking</p>
<p>you know do whatever you know</p>
<p>do whatever the</p>
<p>orders are and the</p>
<p>orders are to kill this guy because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make a</p>
<p>video and this guy is</p>
<p>gonna be a martyr</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna use him as a publicity tool you alright</p>
<p>bitch guess you</p>
<p>gotta die yeah you</p>
<p>know i mean how many fucking people have been killed</p>
<p>interrogations</p>
<p>that were innocent</p>
<p>i mean how many people are in guantanamo</p>
<p>bay that are innocent how many people been killed</p>
<p>by accidental bombs that</p>
<p>know that hit</p>
<p>apartment buildings and shit</p>
<p>at a certain number</p>
<p>when certain</p>
<p>you see a certain amount of casualties i think life</p>
<p>starts to get real cheap you</p>
<p>know we see a certain amount of</p>
<p>you know collateral</p>
<p>damage that happens is just a part of the game</p>
<p>i think for a lot of</p>
<p>these guys life just</p>
<p>starts to get</p>
<p>starts to get</p>
<p>cheap yeah i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>scary shit man</p>
<p>scary shit the idea that someone</p>
<p>is willing to cut someone&rsquo;s fucking head off</p>
<p>for a video</p>
<p>but if you look at like operation northwoods</p>
<p>if you look at that idea the idea of</p>
<p>attacking americans</p>
<p>and blaming on cuban so that we can go to war</p>
<p>it really fits into the the</p>
<p>whole like past</p>
<p>scheme of things yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely all</p>
<p>about getting</p>
<p>you have to get</p>
<p>the american people on your side for shit like this so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s always a big push you know</p>
<p>you gotta get people to go like yeah we</p>
<p>gotta get em we</p>
<p>gotta get em</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s goddamn fucking horrible</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna take a few questions and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get out of here</p>
<p>thirty five thirteen</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t watch the</p>
<p>ufc this weekend did you no</p>
<p>so i can&rsquo;t talk too much</p>
<p>about the ufc</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty interesting because josh koscheck</p>
<p>beat up this dude he fought up</p>
<p>he fought paul daily</p>
<p>and was beating him up</p>
<p>took him down</p>
<p>at will and at one</p>
<p>point in time in the fight</p>
<p>he got kneed in the face an illegal knee</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t look in the replay like</p>
<p>it hit him at all it looked like he just raised him</p>
<p>and he went down it was like making it like he was</p>
<p>really badly hurt</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he was hurt or not he says he was</p>
<p>so but it didn&rsquo;t look real</p>
<p>but it was it</p>
<p>might have been part of</p>
<p>his strategy to fuck with this dude because he was like</p>
<p>relentlessly taunting him</p>
<p>and tormenting him like you</p>
<p>would take him down he was talking shit to him</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>on top of them beating him up and the guy just</p>
<p>could not get up and</p>
<p>every time he wanted to he took him down in the last 30</p>
<p>seconds he&rsquo;s just talking shit to this dude</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s on top of him just</p>
<p>parkin chan and</p>
<p>paul dale is trying to</p>
<p>gouge his eyes when he&rsquo;s on the bottom it was crazy man</p>
<p>and he was just like i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck he said</p>
<p>but whatever he said it was driving him nuts</p>
<p>so anyway the bell ends to the round</p>
<p>he gets off this dude and</p>
<p>starts to walk away</p>
<p>and paul daly</p>
<p>walks up behind him like when</p>
<p>like walks up behind the</p>
<p>referee walks up to him and sucker</p>
<p>punches him</p>
<p>after the fight was over</p>
<p>yeah gets booted from the</p>
<p>ufc for life</p>
<p>which you know</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that you know that that</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>fight and then</p>
<p>try to sucker</p>
<p>punch a guy because you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to hit him for 15 minutes because he was too good</p>
<p>because he was taking you down and he was</p>
<p>imposing his game plan on you and they sucker punch him</p>
<p>daily is booted for life for life yeah he fucked up</p>
<p>you know and dana</p>
<p>white got really pissed he</p>
<p>asked him a question like he</p>
<p>asked him apparently</p>
<p>after the fight was over</p>
<p>do you still want to</p>
<p>fight in the ufc and</p>
<p>why are you doing shit like this</p>
<p>and he shrugged his</p>
<p>shoulders and walked away and dana</p>
<p>was like good</p>
<p>well now you won&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ll make that decision for you</p>
<p>and just like you can&rsquo;t do shit like that if you do</p>
<p>you gotta keep your composure like</p>
<p>you talk a lot of shit before the fight and</p>
<p>this guy talks</p>
<p>mad shit like that&rsquo;s his thing</p>
<p>and coshcheck talks mad shit too so paul</p>
<p>dale and coshcheck</p>
<p>were just going back and forth and back and forth</p>
<p>and it generated</p>
<p>an incredible amount of interest in the fight</p>
<p>but it also put an incredible amount of pressure on him</p>
<p>and when he was getting</p>
<p>his ass kicked and when it was over and he just got</p>
<p>molested for fucking</p>
<p>three rounds like an end of the knee</p>
<p>which may or may not have hit costcheck and</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>made it look like a big deal and costcheck like</p>
<p>was lying on his stomach and</p>
<p>you know it was</p>
<p>like making it look like he was out and then when the</p>
<p>referee said to him</p>
<p>referee said</p>
<p>get up i saw the replay</p>
<p>dan mergliad</p>
<p>goes get up i saw the replay it didn&rsquo;t hit you he goes</p>
<p>well can you get this vaseline</p>
<p>out of my eye</p>
<p>he gets the vaseline</p>
<p>out of his eye</p>
<p>and he goes back to</p>
<p>fighting like</p>
<p>normal like what happened you were almost dead</p>
<p>just a few seconds ago</p>
<p>so it was i</p>
<p>think that was all a part of his</p>
<p>psychological strategy to just</p>
<p>fuck that dude&rsquo;s head up and it worked hook line</p>
<p>and center it really did and then at the end of the</p>
<p>fight we&rsquo;re in fucking montreal okay montreal&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>middle of this huge playoff</p>
<p>the canadians</p>
<p>against pittsburgh</p>
<p>so he goes he grabs a</p>
<p>microphone goes don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about it</p>
<p>cause pittsburgh</p>
<p>gonna kick your fucking ass oh</p>
<p>shit and they go nuts made the fucking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never seen anybody like</p>
<p>a sport or love hockey more than the canadians no no</p>
<p>no no oh my god</p>
<p>dude they go nuts</p>
<p>and then he said and</p>
<p>after that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna beat gsp</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have two fucking losses</p>
<p>and they went nuts and they you know and he</p>
<p>leaves but meanwhile</p>
<p>the dude is</p>
<p>a fucking master strategist when it comes to that shit</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s a heel he&rsquo;s playing the heel</p>
<p>and everyone will be so</p>
<p>excited to see his</p>
<p>fight of course</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking brilliant man</p>
<p>generate so much more interest</p>
<p>made himself a</p>
<p>great villain</p>
<p>right yeah he&rsquo;s a fucking he</p>
<p>wears the best</p>
<p>black hat in the business yeah</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>so he did that but dude the fucking</p>
<p>disappointment in the canadians</p>
<p>when he goes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it because pittsburgh&rsquo;s</p>

<p>universally</p>
<p>excited about a</p>
<p>sport and a team</p>
<p>then the canadians are</p>
<p>about their hockey yeah dude when they won we got there</p>
<p>thursday night and they won</p>

<p>and he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s beeping his arm</p>

<p>it was a fucking</p>
<p>party down the</p>
<p>street yeah</p>
<p>every car was honking their horn</p>
<p>people were jumping on top of hoods of cars and</p>
<p>screaming and yelling</p>
<p>and everyone had a big</p>
<p>smile in their face like</p>
<p>you never seen so many people united</p>
<p>people that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t at the game no</p>

<p>level of love for a</p>
<p>sport and a team</p>
<p>they must take it hard though when</p>
<p>those guys lose oh god yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>devastating to them i&rsquo;ve been in vancouver when like</p>
<p>i think it wasn&rsquo;t even like</p>
<p>an nhl team i</p>
<p>think it was like</p>
<p>a club league team was playing like</p>
<p>their club team was playing</p>
<p>and businesses shut down</p>
<p>people were on the streets for a game like they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be different tonight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy man that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you don&rsquo;t see that in america</p>
<p>but not anymore at</p>
<p>least i mean</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>the red sox</p>
<p>when the red sox</p>
<p>made it to the world</p>
<p>series was the bill buckner one when the ball went</p>
<p>through his leg</p>
<p>that was a big goddamn deal the</p>
<p>whole the whole city was into that</p>
<p>and people that that</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>a very similar situation they had won the</p>
<p>world series</p>
<p>back then i</p>
<p>think maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still like that i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not in boston anymore</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember it ever being the intensity</p>
<p>level that it was in canada</p>
<p>in canada those</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>they they they</p>
<p>loved it man</p>
<p>you see this guy</p>
<p>lars vilks he&rsquo;s a swedish</p>

<p>image of muhammad with his body</p>
<p>muhammad&rsquo;s head on the body of a dog</p>

<p>scary that this is</p>
<p>still going on in</p>
<p>2010 and not only</p>
<p>are these guys like</p>
<p>these college students but</p>
<p>these guys are actually you know</p>

<p>have cameras digital cameras they have access to the</p>
<p>internet they even have like forums on message</p>
<p>boards and shit</p>
<p>where they go and</p>
<p>you know like the</p>
<p>south park guys the ones who wanted to kill</p>
<p>south park yeah</p>
<p>and then somebody hacked them you see that no i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it was awesome</p>
<p>somebody hacked him in the</p>
<p>picture was a</p>
<p>muslim guy kissing another</p>
<p>guy and the whole</p>
<p>background was like all like</p>
<p>muhammad&rsquo;s head with a bomb in his turban</p>
<p>you know and they left an</p>
<p>email address</p>
<p>for these guys to</p>
<p>they less than</p>
<p>an email address for</p>
<p>these guys to</p>
<p>to email them like it&rsquo;s contact</p>
<p>us that&rsquo;s us pal</p>
<p>but look at the</p>
<p>is it just me or</p>
<p>his road and look like he is talking to a future out of</p>
<p>shape version of himself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious best</p>
<p>guess so far says this guy oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tommy seguro</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking on our forums it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>forums dot joe rogan</p>
<p>net and that is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the the main forum for my website</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty fucking crazy website it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the podcast go on there</p>
<p>i used to put a lot of</p>
<p>i used to put a lot of blogs up and i</p>
<p>still will write some but</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m in the middle of writing a movie</p>
<p>or movie no a book</p>
<p>and so i got an idea for a movie</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m writing a book</p>
<p>and once i&rsquo;m done with that then i&rsquo;ll be doing</p>
<p>a lot more blogs</p>
<p>again but i got a couple more months to write this book</p>
<p>mostly about stand up comedy</p>
<p>my early days like crazy stories and shit</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s a fucking liar</p>
<p>during the campaign</p>
<p>he was listening to his ipod playlist that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>she knows how to use a fucking ipod yes</p>
<p>rivalries you&rsquo;re correct sir</p>
<p>obama is a fucking liar</p>
<p>i am i i don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying to me</p>
<p>but that shit is very very annoying</p>
<p>okay wearing gold jewelry in one part of the knickberg</p>
<p>video you can see</p>
<p>a military cap move in</p>
<p>front of the camera</p>
<p>he was working on</p>
<p>phone lines he was working on a</p>
<p>tower over in abu ghraib</p>
<p>he took digital</p>
<p>pictures of inside abu</p>
<p>ghraib hence the kidnapping</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why they killed that guy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>by my man rivalries</p>
<p>but that would make sense</p>
<p>if that guy had witnessed</p>
<p>you know the abu ghraib</p>
<p>atrocities before</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the guy</p>
<p>who got his head cut off and said that he was actually</p>
<p>his head was cut off by cia</p>
<p>guys it totally makes</p>
<p>sense you know</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;d be willing to do something like that</p>
<p>what the fuck do i know man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t got no solutions</p>
<p>folks i only got questions</p>
<p>you got any solutions</p>
<p>tommy bond no</p>
<p>answers to anything no that&rsquo;s the goddamn problem</p>
<p>is that there are no answers</p>
<p>we need a radical restructuring</p>
<p>of our entire fucking society</p>
<p>our entire world</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>anytime in our lifetime so what do we do do we put a</p>
<p>patch on things no</p>
<p>you try to control your</p>
<p>micro world that&rsquo;s what you do</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>this is my advice you want some advice</p>
<p>control all the people</p>
<p>that are around you control what you do for a living</p>
<p>control your body control your mind control how you</p>
<p>treat other people</p>
<p>and what kind of</p>
<p>treatment you&rsquo;ll accept from</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>if you do that</p>
<p>and if that shit spreads</p>
<p>and if people</p>
<p>learn by your example then</p>
<p>you really can make a change in the difference right</p>
<p>absolutely make a</p>
<p>small change a</p>
<p>small different</p>
<p>locally sort of like politics</p>
<p>like local politics work</p>
<p>you know like you can if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>local town you can choose to</p>
<p>you know put up a stop sign in an area</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>need to stop because there&rsquo;s some accidents</p>
<p>right you know you can vote on that and that shit will</p>
<p>actually happen and it&rsquo;ll actually become something</p>
<p>state politics there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>state laws that can get</p>
<p>changed you know like</p>
<p>the medical marijuana law in</p>
<p>california is a</p>
<p>clear example of that they voted</p>
<p>like yeah the medical marijuana is helpful for people</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s vote it let&rsquo;s make it real announce a reality</p>
<p>but federally man</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to vote on shit like that</p>
<p>federally you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to vote on shit like that when it comes to the</p>
<p>whole country</p>
<p>and you can make changes</p>
<p>like in your life and people&rsquo;s lives around you too</p>
<p>yeah like if you want to fucking</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you can</p>
<p>you can get away</p>
<p>from shit that&rsquo;s not affecting you in a good way and</p>
<p>get away from</p>
<p>people that are not good for you and that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>can control you can control what you directly affect</p>
<p>the people in your life the way you</p>
<p>think the way you behave</p>
<p>you can control all that</p>
<p>you know the real</p>
<p>problem with us is that we have so much more access to</p>
<p>human beings and to connecting to each other</p>
<p>than we ever had in the past that&rsquo;s why people or</p>
<p>they feel like they can be so douchey on message boards</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>social consequence</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no consequence to</p>
<p>emailing someone</p>
<p>on myspace and just saying</p>
<p>nasty fucked up shit to them</p>
<p>you know i make</p>
<p>comics that we</p>
<p>talk to that get horrible fucking messages on facebook</p>
<p>and on twitter</p>
<p>and dudes just say shit just</p>
<p>to get attention yeah yeah you know and people yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no consequence there&rsquo;s no accountability why</p>
<p>would they even want to</p>
<p>reach out to someone</p>
<p>like that why</p>
<p>would they even want to do that</p>
<p>what is that all</p>
<p>about well it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lost some sort of a</p>
<p>connection with each</p>
<p>other because there&rsquo;s too fucking many of us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why local shit is the only shit that works</p>
<p>you know small</p>
<p>groups of people that you actually impact like</p>
<p>the people that you impact in your personal life</p>
<p>people you impact</p>
<p>local politics people you impact at your</p>
<p>job and in whatever the fuck you do for your living</p>
<p>you know how you impact</p>
<p>those people down that shit&rsquo;s all real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>matter is how do you get it to work like that with the</p>
<p>whole big giant group</p>
<p>yeah yeah you don&rsquo;t man we&rsquo;re fucking rambling we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not saying shit anymore</p>
<p>two hours and a half later</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually the end of the podcast</p>
