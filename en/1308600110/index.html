    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing creativity.</p>
<p>Creativity is a topic that to many people is very abstract.</p>
<p>That is, we know when something seems creative.</p>
<p>Some of us know people who are creative</p>
<p>or perhaps are creative,</p>
<p>and yet the ability to be creative resides in everybody.</p>
<p>And we know that because the neural circuits</p>
<p>that underlie creativity have been somewhat defined,</p>
<p>and the steps and processes within the brain and body</p>
<p>that lead to creativity are well-known.</p>
<p>That said, most people don&rsquo;t know how to access creativity,</p>
<p>and if they do know how to access creativity,</p>
<p>they are only able to access creativity</p>
<p>in a fairly limited number of domains of life.</p>
<p>For instance, in the visual arts, or in music,</p>
<p>or within science, or engineering,</p>
<p>or any number of different domains</p>
<p>ranging from the kitchen to sport</p>
<p>to childhood interactions, that is, childhood games.</p>
<p>In other words, some adults are able</p>
<p>to access their creative spirit</p>
<p>when engaging in childlike play with children,</p>
<p>or for that matter, with adults.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, all of creativity stems</p>
<p>from just a small subset of neural structures in the brain</p>
<p>that need to be activated in a particular sequence or order.</p>
<p>Today, we will talk about what those neural structures are,</p>
<p>what particular order they need to be activated in</p>
<p>in order to come up with, for instance,</p>
<p>new ideas that are creative,</p>
<p>and then how to implement those creative strategies.</p>
<p>We will also talk about different ways to access creativity</p>
<p>that include narrative and storytelling,</p>
<p>as well as applying new rule sets</p>
<p>or even entirely new worldviews.</p>
<p>And we will do this in a structured way</p>
<p>that will allow anyone,</p>
<p>whether or not you consider yourself creative or not,</p>
<p>to be able to apply these tools</p>
<p>in different domains of life,</p>
<p>work, family, play, and on and on.</p>
<p>By the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have a better understanding</p>
<p>of what creativity is and how to access it,</p>
<p>and if you like, to bring others</p>
<p>into your creative endeavors,</p>
<p>which, as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>can massively expand the extent to which you yourself</p>
<p>can express your creative talents,</p>
<p>as is the case with all episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Today, we will discuss both scientific mechanisms</p>
<p>and nomenclature,</p>
<p>and I promise to make all of that clear to you,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology or psychology,</p>
<p>but we will also, of course, discuss tools,</p>
<p>that is specific steps that you can take</p>
<p>in order to be more creative.</p>
<p>One particular tool that I&rsquo;m excited to share with you</p>
<p>involves a meditation,</p>
<p>but this is a very unusual meditation.</p>
<p>This is not sitting with eyes closed,</p>
<p>focusing on your breath,</p>
<p>or focusing on a chime,</p>
<p>or some other feature in your sensory environment,</p>
<p>or even in your body.</p>
<p>Later, we will talk about open monitoring meditations.</p>
<p>Open monitoring meditations are very distinct</p>
<p>from other forms of meditation,</p>
<p>and involve learning how to sit back</p>
<p>and simply observe your thoughts</p>
<p>while intentionally varying where your thoughts go.</p>
<p>So for those of you that find it a struggle</p>
<p>to focus or to refocus</p>
<p>in more traditional forms of meditation,</p>
<p>or maybe even in your work,</p>
<p>and even for those of you that may suffer</p>
<p>from things like ADHD or similar,</p>
<p>open monitoring meditation can be an extremely valuable tool</p>
<p>for accessing your creative abilities</p>
<p>because of the ways that it allows you</p>
<p>to tap into specific circuits</p>
<p>within the frontal networks of your brain.</p>
<p>So these are networks of the brain</p>
<p>that include the areas just behind your forehead,</p>
<p>and that allow you to evaluate new and novel rule sets</p>
<p>in a very unconstrained way.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it,</p>
<p>creativity is really the ability</p>
<p>to take existing elements from the physical world,</p>
<p>or from the thought world, if you will,</p>
<p>or from any domain of life,</p>
<p>mood, thinking, and information,</p>
<p>and to reorder those into novel combinations</p>
<p>that are useful for something.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll also find out later,</p>
<p>creativity has this incredible aspect to it,</p>
<p>which is that when we see or create</p>
<p>or experience something that is truly creative,</p>
<p>it reveals to us something fundamental</p>
<p>about the way that the natural world,</p>
<p>and indeed the way that our brains work.</p>
<p>If that sounds very mysterious and abstract to you now,</p>
<p>I promise that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will not only understand what that means,</p>
<p>but you will also understand</p>
<p>how to use open monitoring meditations,</p>
<p>as well as other forms of tools</p>
<p>in order to access your creative ability.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Roka.</p>
<p>Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>that are the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The company was founded by two all-American swimmers</p>
<p>from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses</p>
<p>and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lifetime working on the biology</p>
<p>of the visual system, and I can tell you</p>
<p>that your visual system has to contend</p>
<p>with an enormous number of challenges</p>
<p>for you to be able to see clearly.</p>
<p>For instance, when you move from a shady area</p>
<p>to a sunny area, there are all sorts of adaptations</p>
<p>that have to occur in your eye and brain.</p>
<p>Roka understands these kinds of adaptations,</p>
<p>and the other ones required to see clearly,</p>
<p>and those are built into the engineering</p>
<p>of their sunglasses and eyeglasses.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Roka eyeglasses</p>
<p>and sunglasses so terrific</p>
<p>is that they are extremely lightweight.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time, I don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re on my face.</p>
<p>I wear sunglasses when I drive</p>
<p>and whenever I need to throughout the day,</p>
<p>and I wear readers at night.</p>
<p>I do not wear sunglasses when I get my morning sunlight,</p>
<p>which I do every single morning,</p>
<p>as you should be doing also,</p>
<p>as is covered many times on this podcast.</p>
<p>Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are also unique</p>
<p>in that unlike a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses</p>
<p>out there, they don&rsquo;t make you look like a cyborg.</p>
<p>They have some of the styles</p>
<p>that make you look like a cyborg, if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>but if you want to wear glasses or sunglasses out to dinner</p>
<p>or around for social reasons,</p>
<p>they have many different aesthetic styles to choose from.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,</p>
<p>go to roka.com, that&rsquo;s R-O-K-A.com,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>And as you may have heard me say before,</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the word nootropics</p>
<p>because it means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And frankly, there is no neural circuit in the brain</p>
<p>for being quote-unquote smart.</p>
<p>There are neural circuits for focus.</p>
<p>There are neural circuits for task switching.</p>
<p>There are neural circuits for today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>which is creativity.</p>
<p>Nootropics, therefore, is not a great word</p>
<p>to describe any sort of supplement or drug</p>
<p>that can enhance brain function</p>
<p>because it lacks specificity.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this,</p>
<p>and therefore has designed custom nootropics</p>
<p>that are tailored to your specific needs</p>
<p>and that allow you to enter the brain and bodily states</p>
<p>that are optimal for things like focus,</p>
<p>energy, creativity, and so on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try</p>
<p>your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take their brief three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first box.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that contains everything you need,</p>
<p>that is sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>in the precise ratios that you need without sugar.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>and elsewhere, every cell in your body</p>
<p>requires hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>in order to function properly.</p>
<p>And a key example of this are the neurons,</p>
<p>the nerve cells of your brain</p>
<p>that allow you to think clearly,</p>
<p>to exercise hard, et cetera.</p>
<p>Neurons require sodium</p>
<p>in order to fire what are called action potentials</p>
<p>or electrical signaling between neurons,</p>
<p>and they require potassium and magnesium,</p>
<p>and those have to be present in the correct ratios</p>
<p>in order for your brain and body to function optimally.</p>
<p>Element is formulated to help anyone</p>
<p>with their electrolyte needs</p>
<p>and is perfectly suited to anyone following</p>
<p>a ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, or paleolithic diet,</p>
<p>or a basic omnivore diet, which is the one that I follow.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>And right now, Element has two special flavors</p>
<p>for the holidays, chocolate caramel and mint chocolate,</p>
<p>which I should mention tastes especially good</p>
<p>if you actually heat it up.</p>
<p>So if you treat it sort of like a tea, it works,</p>
<p>or if you drink it cold, it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>All the flavors of Element I find delicious.</p>
<p>Again, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>To find the supplements we discuss</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that the library</p>
<p>of those supplements is constantly expanding.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about creativity.</p>
<p>Now on the face of it, the word creativity</p>
<p>and creative acts might seem somewhat abstract to us.</p>
<p>That is, we know when we see something</p>
<p>that we consider creative,</p>
<p>and we know when we see something that is not creative,</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t creative are things</p>
<p>that we see every day.</p>
<p>A car with four tires, for instance,</p>
<p>a bicycle with two tires, not creative.</p>
<p>However, we also see things that are novel,</p>
<p>that are different,</p>
<p>and that we don&rsquo;t really think of as creative.</p>
<p>In fact, they can be downright trivial.</p>
<p>For instance, if I were to take a fish tank</p>
<p>and put wings on it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a novel combination of things,</p>
<p>which is one of the key criteria for an act</p>
<p>or an object or a piece of music that is creative.</p>
<p>And yet, neither of us, I believe,</p>
<p>would find it very creative or very interesting</p>
<p>that a fish tank has wings on it.</p>
<p>Why, or why not, I should say?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that for something to be creative,</p>
<p>it actually has to reveal to us something fundamental</p>
<p>about the world or about how we work.</p>
<p>And I must say that oftentimes,</p>
<p>the most creative and the most interesting</p>
<p>and the most beloved creative acts</p>
<p>reveal to us something fundamental about the world</p>
<p>or the way that we work,</p>
<p>in a way that delights and thrills and surprises us,</p>
<p>but that we aren&rsquo;t even aware</p>
<p>what that fundamental rule is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll return to this in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but the time being,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just build up from first principles.</p>
<p>What constitutes something creative</p>
<p>and what does not constitute something creative?</p>
<p>Creativity is a way of interacting with the world</p>
<p>or combining or recombining things in the world</p>
<p>in a way that appears novel to us and to other people.</p>
<p>My example of a fish tank with wings on it is novel,</p>
<p>but frankly, it&rsquo;s not very creative</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t reveal anything new to us.</p>
<p>Sure, they&rsquo;re flying fish,</p>
<p>although they just kind of jump far, they don&rsquo;t really fly.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, putting wings on a fish tank</p>
<p>could be used as a metaphor</p>
<p>for the fact that fish don&rsquo;t fly,</p>
<p>but you already knew and I already knew that fish don&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s nothing novel revealed to us about the world</p>
<p>except something we already knew.</p>
<p>Now, creative acts on the other hand,</p>
<p>of course involve novel combinations of existing rule sets.</p>
<p>That could be different combinations of music</p>
<p>or colors or shapes or technology, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it does so in a way</p>
<p>that tells us something fundamental and different.</p>
<p>Let me give an example</p>
<p>of a few truly creative artistic acts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do that in the domain of visual arts,</p>
<p>but of course there are many examples</p>
<p>that could come from music or from other domains,</p>
<p>sport, et cetera.</p>
<p>Examples I&rsquo;ll give rather than a fish tank with wings</p>
<p>are for instance, the comparison between a drawing</p>
<p>or a very accurate painting of a face,</p>
<p>an Escher painting and a Banksy.</p>
<p>Okay, if you don&rsquo;t know what those are, I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>an accurate representation of a face.</p>
<p>If I were to sit you down</p>
<p>or if you were to send me a photograph</p>
<p>and then I were to paint or draw a picture of your face</p>
<p>in a way that faithfully represented the position</p>
<p>and shape of your nose relative to the eyes,</p>
<p>maybe a curl of the lip,</p>
<p>maybe a few hairs of your eyebrows in a particular way</p>
<p>that really captured you accurately.</p>
<p>I think most people would say, okay, it&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>It looks a lot like the photograph or the person.</p>
<p>And on the one hand, while that could be interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not particularly creative</p>
<p>because it faithfully represents what&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>In contrast, a painting or a picture like an Escher,</p>
<p>and for those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar with Eschers,</p>
<p>involves a lot of repeating patterns.</p>
<p>So for instance, a bird image that&rsquo;s repeated</p>
<p>over and over and over and over again,</p>
<p>sometimes in partially overlapping manner,</p>
<p>and perhaps a building that&rsquo;s repeated</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>or stones repeated over and over again,</p>
<p>or staircases over and over again.</p>
<p>Eschers capture elements from the outside world</p>
<p>and faithfully represent them,</p>
<p>but faithfully represent them over and over and over again,</p>
<p>which is not typically seen in the natural world.</p>
<p>In fact, most of what our visual system does</p>
<p>is to eliminate repetitive patterns when we see them.</p>
<p>In fact, most of what our visual system does</p>
<p>is try and make us blind to repetitive patterns</p>
<p>in our visual environment,</p>
<p>and only allow us to see things that are unusual</p>
<p>in that visual environment.</p>
<p>Now, this is especially true at visual scales.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is if you were to go to the beach</p>
<p>and lie on your towel and look down at the sand,</p>
<p>you would start to notice</p>
<p>that the sand is a very, very repetitive pattern.</p>
<p>So at very small scales,</p>
<p>and in particular at molecular scales,</p>
<p>when you get down to the level of atoms and so forth,</p>
<p>everything is repetitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just reproduced in different combinations</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>But as we move through our world,</p>
<p>typically we&rsquo;re not looking down at pebbles on the ground</p>
<p>or little grains of sand,</p>
<p>or the pattern of leaves in a particular clover</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Most of the time we&rsquo;re looking out on landscapes</p>
<p>or at people&rsquo;s faces, et cetera.</p>
<p>And very seldom do we see</p>
<p>highly repetitive patterns at that scale.</p>
<p>So what Eschers do is they essentially reveal to us</p>
<p>a fundamental feature</p>
<p>about the way that our visual system works,</p>
<p>which is that repetitive patterns</p>
<p>tend to become noise in our visual system.</p>
<p>That is our brain encodes repetition</p>
<p>as things not to be interested in.</p>
<p>And the things that stand out against that repetition</p>
<p>as the things to be interested in,</p>
<p>so-called signal to noise.</p>
<p>What Eschers do is they invert the relationship</p>
<p>between signal and noise,</p>
<p>and they make the repetitive patterns, the signal,</p>
<p>and the unusual patterns, the noise.</p>
<p>In fact, in every Escher there are unusual patterns</p>
<p>and those completely disappear to us.</p>
<p>Now, when you look at an Escher,</p>
<p>what you probably see and what I see</p>
<p>are just a bunch of birds repeated over and over again,</p>
<p>or buildings or staircases repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>And you may like Eschers and you may not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re not talking about taste</p>
<p>in particular creative acts.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to identify here</p>
<p>are the rules and mechanisms</p>
<p>of what constitutes something creative</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s creative.</p>
<p>And the key element here is that what&rsquo;s revealed by an Escher</p>
<p>through these repetition patterns</p>
<p>is an inversion of the way</p>
<p>that our brain normally encodes visual images.</p>
<p>And therefore the rule that repetition</p>
<p>is suppressed in our visual system</p>
<p>and that unusual visual features are revealed to us,</p>
<p>that rule is what pops out to us</p>
<p>when we look at an Escher.</p>
<p>Now, when I say pops out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that you look at an Escher and go,</p>
<p>oh, normally I don&rsquo;t see repetition,</p>
<p>normally I see the unusual stuff, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there seems to be something about truly creative acts</p>
<p>that capture the attention</p>
<p>and sometimes the delight of many, many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they reveal a fundamental rule</p>
<p>about how the brain or the world work.</p>
<p>Let me give you a different example,</p>
<p>also from the visual art world.</p>
<p>Let me give you the example of Banksy.</p>
<p>Banksy is an artist</p>
<p>that many of you are probably familiar with</p>
<p>and probably some of you are not familiar with.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are not familiar with Banksy,</p>
<p>Banksy is an artist</p>
<p>that most often does two-dimensional artwork.</p>
<p>So these would be stencils or paintings or drawings,</p>
<p>like many artists,</p>
<p>and does them in an urban landscape,</p>
<p>an actual city or suburban landscape.</p>
<p>That is, he draws our stencils or graffitis</p>
<p>in a very cryptic way, I should say,</p>
<p>no one really knows who Banksy is or when he does his art,</p>
<p>he just reveals his art by putting it up,</p>
<p>but he does this in the context of cities</p>
<p>and on three-dimensional objects.</p>
<p>So a good example would be,</p>
<p>he will stencil next to a phone booth, a police officer,</p>
<p>or he will graffiti next to an actual fire hydrant,</p>
<p>a dog lifting its leg to urinate on that fire hydrant.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about Banksy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is not simply the fact that he puts two-dimensional art</p>
<p>onto three-dimensional surfaces</p>
<p>in the urban and suburban landscape,</p>
<p>because if you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done many, many times before,</p>
<p>all graffiti is that, all city art and murals is that.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s unique about Banksy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unique about Banksy,</p>
<p>or I should say Banksy&rsquo;s, the actual art,</p>
<p>is that he combines two-dimensional art</p>
<p>with a three-dimensional landscape</p>
<p>in a way that the concept pops out at you.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, in the case of the dog lifting its leg to urinate</p>
<p>on the fire hydrant,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a scene that most people,</p>
<p>and in fact, most children are familiar with</p>
<p>from cartoons or from our basic understanding</p>
<p>of the stereotype of dogs,</p>
<p>and I must tell you, having owned a male dog,</p>
<p>a bulldog, Costello, for many years,</p>
<p>hydrants were a particular target for Costello.</p>
<p>Of course, everything was a particular target</p>
<p>for Costello urinating outdoors.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he liked to pee on fire hydrants.</p>
<p>That itself is not interesting.</p>
<p>Seeing a photograph of a dog raising its leg</p>
<p>to pee on a fire hydrant is not interesting.</p>
<p>Seeing a painting of that isn&rsquo;t interesting.</p>
<p>Seeing an actual dog urinating on a fire hydrant</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t interesting.</p>
<p>In fact, seeing a painting in two dimensions</p>
<p>of a dog raising its leg to,</p>
<p>of course, it can&rsquo;t actually urinate,</p>
<p>but give you the impression that it would urinate</p>
<p>on that fire hydrant isn&rsquo;t particularly interesting</p>
<p>except for the fact that it reveals to us</p>
<p>something fundamental,</p>
<p>which is that we tend to pair visual relationships</p>
<p>between different objects that share a common theme,</p>
<p>and then the theme tends to pop out at us.</p>
<p>So for instance, the dog raising its leg</p>
<p>next to a fire hydrant,</p>
<p>even if the dog is drawn in two dimensions</p>
<p>and the fire hydrant is in three dimensions,</p>
<p>allows the concept of dog and fire hydrant</p>
<p>to emerge or pop out at us,</p>
<p>which reveals to us something fundamental</p>
<p>about how our brain works,</p>
<p>which is that our brain encodes concepts and entire stories</p>
<p>as symbols of interaction between different objects.</p>
<p>Let me give you a different example</p>
<p>just to make sure that this hits home.</p>
<p>One of Banksy&rsquo;s more famous paintings</p>
<p>is a rather politically charged one,</p>
<p>which is of a girl holding a bouquet of balloons,</p>
<p>and this two-dimensional drawing was put onto the West wall,</p>
<p>dividing territories in the Middle East,</p>
<p>a very controversial issue.</p>
<p>The controversies of that issue</p>
<p>are not what I want to get into,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think anyone would doubt</p>
<p>that it is a controversial issue.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional drawing of the girl with the balloons</p>
<p>on the actual wall turns out to be quite interesting</p>
<p>as an art piece, because what it reveals to us</p>
<p>is the entire controversy around the presence of that wall</p>
<p>and the desire for certain people to breach that wall</p>
<p>and the desire for other people to insist</p>
<p>that that will not be breached for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Again, this is not about the particular controversy.</p>
<p>The point is that a two-dimensional image</p>
<p>combined with a three-dimensional structure</p>
<p>allows the purpose of that three-dimensional structure</p>
<p>and the controversy around that three-dimensional structure</p>
<p>to pop out at us in a way that if,</p>
<p>for instance, we had just seen a photograph</p>
<p>of somebody next to that wall or with a ladder,</p>
<p>or if we just seen a drawing of a girl</p>
<p>holding a bouquet of balloons on a drawing of that wall</p>
<p>to not emerge.</p>
<p>In other words, it captures two fundamental features</p>
<p>of the visual system, our ability to encode things</p>
<p>in two dimensions and understand symbols,</p>
<p>and our ability to understand things in three dimensions,</p>
<p>and in particular, the wall as a three-dimensional object</p>
<p>is really interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an actual physical barrier.</p>
<p>So showing it as the actual physical barrier</p>
<p>that it is in real space in three dimensions</p>
<p>turns out to allow the interaction between those two things,</p>
<p>the concept, the controversy to pop out at us</p>
<p>and make us think about that particular controversy</p>
<p>and perhaps where we each individually stand</p>
<p>on that controversy.</p>
<p>Now, there are many examples</p>
<p>of what I just gave in the visual domain.</p>
<p>For instance, Rothko&rsquo;s, which are just color on canvas</p>
<p>are particularly interesting source of information</p>
<p>about the way that the brain encodes color.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll fill in exactly what that information is.</p>
<p>You may like Rothko&rsquo;s, you may not,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing.</p>
<p>When you look at a Rothko,</p>
<p>you are seeing colors in a very different way</p>
<p>than you would ever see colors in any other context.</p>
<p>The fact that they don&rsquo;t have a frame typically,</p>
<p>and the fact that there&rsquo;s no white canvas</p>
<p>allows the colors that you see to be novel hues</p>
<p>of those colors that you will not see in any other context.</p>
<p>And in doing so reveals to you</p>
<p>what your brain does in order to understand</p>
<p>and extract color.</p>
<p>Now, in the context of music, for instance,</p>
<p>you will sometimes hear a street musician play a song,</p>
<p>maybe a Bob Dylan song or a Led Zeppelin song</p>
<p>or a Pink Floyd song pretty closely, pretty accurately</p>
<p>to the way that song is played.</p>
<p>But of course that&rsquo;s not creative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like the photograph</p>
<p>or the accurate portrait of somebody&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Or you may hear an acoustic version</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s normally an electric guitar song</p>
<p>or electrical song or vice versa.</p>
<p>Somewhat creative, sometimes sounds even better</p>
<p>than the original, but not particularly creative.</p>
<p>However, each and every one of us</p>
<p>has a particular taste in music.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s classical, maybe it&rsquo;s rock,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s punk, maybe it&rsquo;s hip hop.</p>
<p>Within each of those genres,</p>
<p>I think all of us are familiar with hearing something</p>
<p>for the first time and maybe even every time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the combination</p>
<p>of the words and the music,</p>
<p>or sometimes just the music or just the words</p>
<p>that allows some feature of it to pop out at us</p>
<p>as particularly exciting.</p>
<p>And when we feel that excitement</p>
<p>and we feel that it&rsquo;s really novel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than what we&rsquo;ve heard before,</p>
<p>I assure you what it&rsquo;s revealing to you</p>
<p>is the way that your auditory system</p>
<p>and often your auditory and your emotional system</p>
<p>encodes information that you hear.</p>
<p>And again, the rule that it&rsquo;s revealing</p>
<p>is not splayed out for you.</p>
<p>For instance, it&rsquo;s not told to you,</p>
<p>oh, this is the way you normally hear</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re hearing things differently.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the change in, for instance,</p>
<p>in the way that words are accented</p>
<p>or the way that sentences are constructed.</p>
<p>This often you&rsquo;ll hear in hip hop,</p>
<p>the way that sentences are constructed</p>
<p>can be divided up, not as normal declarative sentences,</p>
<p>the way that they&rsquo;re typically written,</p>
<p>but the way that sentences are chopped up and fractured</p>
<p>reveals to us new meaning,</p>
<p>and in fact, enhanced meaning about particular words</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t see if it was written out as a paragraph</p>
<p>and then sung as a script</p>
<p>that would be the same as the one that we would read.</p>
<p>Again, the point is that what is exciting and novel to you</p>
<p>is just the way that you hear it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s exciting and novel to you</p>
<p>because there are circuits within the brain</p>
<p>that when we hear or see or feel or experience</p>
<p>known elements in new ways that are truly creative,</p>
<p>the way that those neural circuits function is changed.</p>
<p>And when neural circuits change the way that they function</p>
<p>simply by way of what comes into our eyes, our ears,</p>
<p>and the way that we experience our feelings,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the release of chemicals,</p>
<p>including the release of the chemical dopamine</p>
<p>and other neuromodulators as well</p>
<p>that make us feel both surprised, delighted,</p>
<p>and this is very key,</p>
<p>excited in anticipation that we might see it again.</p>
<p>So with the understanding in mind that true creativity</p>
<p>involves the novel combination of some elements,</p>
<p>could be notes of music, could be numbers,</p>
<p>could be visual elements like lines or colors,</p>
<p>could be physical movements, et cetera,</p>
<p>but novel combinations of some things</p>
<p>that reveal to us something fundamental</p>
<p>about the way that our brain and or the world work.</p>
<p>And of course, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>that fundamental thing may or may not</p>
<p>be consciously accessible to us.</p>
<p>We may not know what exactly it is that&rsquo;s novel to us,</p>
<p>but it feels novel and it feels true.</p>
<p>Well, with that understanding in mind,</p>
<p>we therefore can ask what are the underlying principles</p>
<p>and neural circuits that underlie the creative process?</p>
<p>And the word process here is especially important.</p>
<p>In fact, if there&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to impress on everybody</p>
<p>is that when thinking about biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always better to think about verbs</p>
<p>as opposed to nouns.</p>
<p>So rather than think of creativity as a noun</p>
<p>or somebody being creative as an adjective,</p>
<p>think about the verb creativity.</p>
<p>That is, what are the steps required?</p>
<p>And therefore, what are the cells and circuits</p>
<p>and thoughts, et cetera, required in order to be creative?</p>
<p>This element of thinking about verbs</p>
<p>then allows us to say, okay,</p>
<p>what are the various steps in coming up</p>
<p>with a creative idea, in testing a creative idea,</p>
<p>and then implementing that creative idea?</p>
<p>And in doing so, we find,</p>
<p>based on the scientific literature,</p>
<p>that there are basically three major networks</p>
<p>within the brain, each of which is responsible</p>
<p>for each of the three steps</p>
<p>to arrive at something truly creative.</p>
<p>The first neural circuit involved in creativity</p>
<p>is the so-called executive network.</p>
<p>This is kind of a goofy name</p>
<p>because the neural circuits that I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>do a bunch of other things as well,</p>
<p>but they certainly control</p>
<p>what are called executive functions.</p>
<p>Executive functions are functions that you and I both have,</p>
<p>which is our ability to govern our thinking</p>
<p>and our behavior in very deliberate ways.</p>
<p>And that is largely accomplished</p>
<p>through the use of the neural circuitry</p>
<p>that sits right behind the forebrain,</p>
<p>the so-called prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Now, the prefrontal cortex involves</p>
<p>many different sub-regions.</p>
<p>It has a bunch of different parts,</p>
<p>just like any country has different states, et cetera,</p>
<p>and provinces.</p>
<p>Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and some other neural structures.</p>
<p>But for sake of this discussion,</p>
<p>executive function and the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>are mainly responsible for suppressing action,</p>
<p>that is for eliminating choices</p>
<p>among the infinite number of choices that exist,</p>
<p>for instance, of what colors to combine on a painting</p>
<p>or what lines to draw or what notes to play</p>
<p>or what movements to make in a sports endeavor,</p>
<p>what numbers to include in a mathematics endeavor,</p>
<p>or what words and letters and syllables and sentences</p>
<p>to include in writing a creative passage.</p>
<p>The second network is the so-called default mode network.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of discussion nowadays</p>
<p>about the default mode network</p>
<p>as it relates to consciousness and meditation, et cetera.</p>
<p>The default mode network does many different things,</p>
<p>but in the context of our discussion about creativity,</p>
<p>the default mode network is really the network</p>
<p>that starts being engaged when you close your eyes</p>
<p>and start paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in terms of your thinking</p>
<p>as opposed to the sensory outside world.</p>
<p>And the default mode network is especially important</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s called spontaneous imagination.</p>
<p>Now, spontaneous imagination is something</p>
<p>that you can try at any moment</p>
<p>if you were to close your eyes</p>
<p>and to try and not pay attention to the sounds around you,</p>
<p>but even if you do,</p>
<p>to just pay attention to whatever thoughts</p>
<p>or feelings emerge when your eyes are closed, okay?</p>
<p>By closing your eyes and shutting yourself off</p>
<p>to the outside sensory world,</p>
<p>you start to engage much more of your brain machinery</p>
<p>dedicated towards what&rsquo;s going on inside you,</p>
<p>so-called interoception,</p>
<p>but also what you&rsquo;re thinking about your thinking,</p>
<p>whether or not your thoughts are complete or incomplete,</p>
<p>whether or not they are fragmentary in a way</p>
<p>that goes from one thought to another,</p>
<p>distantly in the past or present or future, et cetera.</p>
<p>Depending on time of day, how well-rested you are,</p>
<p>how stressed you are, how happy you are,</p>
<p>the default mode network will take you through a journey</p>
<p>of different types of thoughts,</p>
<p>different types of feelings, et cetera.</p>
<p>The specific types of thoughts and feelings</p>
<p>are not as interesting as the fact</p>
<p>that when you close your eyes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially engaging this default mode network,</p>
<p>which is essentially the network associated</p>
<p>with imagination and imagination based on elements</p>
<p>that exist only within your head,</p>
<p>that is within your brain, okay?</p>
<p>And therefore must rely on memory of previous experiences.</p>
<p>As soon as you close your eyes,</p>
<p>you are shutting yourself off from the sensory world.</p>
<p>So by definition, you can no longer be bringing</p>
<p>in novel experiences in that moment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re relying on your library of existing experiences</p>
<p>and your memory of those in order to imagine new things.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing this in a very, in a free associative way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to imagine new things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just whatever geysers to the surface, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the executive network,</p>
<p>which is involved in suppressing particular thoughts</p>
<p>or actions.</p>
<p>We have the default mode network,</p>
<p>which is involved in imagination.</p>
<p>And the default mode network I should mention</p>
<p>also involves a sub-region of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the medial prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>but other brain regions as well.</p>
<p>And then the final element within the circuits</p>
<p>underlying creativity is the so-called salience network.</p>
<p>The salience network is a network of brain regions</p>
<p>that involves areas such as the insula,</p>
<p>which actually has a complete map of your body surface,</p>
<p>as well as some information mapped there</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in the outside world</p>
<p>and how those combine with what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in your internal landscape that is within your body.</p>
<p>Also a brain region called the ACC or, excuse me,</p>
<p>anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala.</p>
<p>So a lot of information is mapped</p>
<p>within the salience network about how we feel</p>
<p>and how we feel in relation to things</p>
<p>that are happening around us and within us.</p>
<p>And the salience network has one main job,</p>
<p>which is to pay attention to what&rsquo;s most interesting</p>
<p>either in the world or inside us</p>
<p>in terms of feelings or experiences, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got three networks, executive network,</p>
<p>which is there to suppress choices</p>
<p>in terms of actions we could take, but decide not to,</p>
<p>or things we could think about,</p>
<p>but choose not to or try not to.</p>
<p>The default mode network,</p>
<p>which is basically the catalog or library</p>
<p>of previous experiences that we have available to us</p>
<p>that would act as sort of the paints on a palette</p>
<p>or the possible ingredients that could go into a recipe.</p>
<p>All of that has to, again,</p>
<p>arise from previous experience, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t close our eyes</p>
<p>and suddenly be able to access all the melodies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never heard before,</p>
<p>or all our ideas and concepts and knowledge about music</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have musical understanding</p>
<p>or visual understanding.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really drawing up the library</p>
<p>and that library tends to be rather disorganized.</p>
<p>It kind of swirls around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very structured</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re actively trying to think about something.</p>
<p>And then we have the salience network,</p>
<p>which is the networks within the brain that decide</p>
<p>or make choices about what&rsquo;s most interesting</p>
<p>to pay attention to in a given moment.</p>
<p>Okay, so those three networks work together</p>
<p>to create things.</p>
<p>And when I say create things,</p>
<p>we again have to really underscore</p>
<p>our definition of creativity.</p>
<p>Creativity is a rearrangement of existing elements</p>
<p>into novel combinations that reveal something fundamental</p>
<p>about how we or the world works.</p>
<p>And this is very important,</p>
<p>it tends to be things that are useful.</p>
<p>Now they can merely be useful</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re entertaining or thrilling.</p>
<p>They can also have a particular utility</p>
<p>or use in the world like a piece of technology</p>
<p>that is actually useful,</p>
<p>like an app or a smartphone or a computer</p>
<p>actually has utility or a vehicle.</p>
<p>You know, there are creative acts</p>
<p>that led to the formation of vehicles and computers,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>But the point is that just merely coming up</p>
<p>with novel combinations of things</p>
<p>like wings on a fish tank,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not creative or it&rsquo;s not creative</p>
<p>in any kind of meaningful way</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s simply not useful.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t reveal anything fundamental,</p>
<p>new or purposeful.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow us to think about</p>
<p>or interact with the world or ourselves in novel ways.</p>
<p>Whereas things, people, actions</p>
<p>and ideas that are truly creative</p>
<p>really change the way that we are able to access the world.</p>
<p>They act as portals to the world and to ourselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.</p>
<p>And it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So now you have some idea about the brain areas</p>
<p>and networks involved in creativity</p>
<p>but I want to be very clear</p>
<p>that anytime we talk about mechanisms and brain areas</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s far more important than the names</p>
<p>of those brain areas is an understanding of what they do.</p>
<p>So if you couldn&rsquo;t remember the anterior cingulate cortex</p>
<p>or the fact that the prefrontal cortex is involved</p>
<p>in executive function, et cetera, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less important that you know the names of things</p>
<p>than you understand the action steps that those things take.</p>
<p>That is the verb actions</p>
<p>that those particular brain areas engage</p>
<p>in order to arrive at a particular end point.</p>
<p>And the end point we&rsquo;re talking about today is creativity.</p>
<p>I want to discuss creativity in terms</p>
<p>of what actually goes into being creative.</p>
<p>And it turns out there are just two elements</p>
<p>and those two elements are now well-understood</p>
<p>from the perspective of psychology.</p>
<p>And fortunately the neuroscience well supports</p>
<p>what the psychology says and vice versa.</p>
<p>And those two elements that go into coming up</p>
<p>with a creative idea and then implementing</p>
<p>or developing that creative idea into something real</p>
<p>that you and the rest of the world can experience</p>
<p>are divergent thinking and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And divergent thinking and convergent thinking</p>
<p>are very straightforward to understand.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking is taking some known object</p>
<p>or event in the world or sport or concept.</p>
<p>It could be running, it could be a musical note,</p>
<p>it could be jumping, it could be a particular color</p>
<p>on a piece of paper and asking yourself</p>
<p>how many different things could that thing actually be?</p>
<p>You might say, well, running is running</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s use divergent thinking as a way to illustrate</p>
<p>what divergent thinking is.</p>
<p>If I show you a picture of somebody running,</p>
<p>I say, what do you see?</p>
<p>And you say, I see somebody running.</p>
<p>And then I might give you a divergent thinking task</p>
<p>and these tasks are the same ones used</p>
<p>in various experiments.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, how many different things can you think about</p>
<p>based on this picture that you see of somebody running?</p>
<p>Now, if you are able to engage divergent thinking,</p>
<p>you could say running to the store,</p>
<p>running away from a lion, running towards somebody I love</p>
<p>or maybe you have a more elaborate imagination</p>
<p>and you could say running in front of a bus to grab a kid</p>
<p>so the kid doesn&rsquo;t get hit by the bus</p>
<p>or running toward a concert</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m so excited about the particular concert</p>
<p>and then it starts to spool into a story.</p>
<p>In other words, divergent thinking involves taking</p>
<p>one simple, what we would call in neuroscience</p>
<p>or psychology, stimulus, one image or sound, et cetera,</p>
<p>and trying to radiate out from that</p>
<p>as many different divergent situations, properties,</p>
<p>characteristics, events, things</p>
<p>from that one specific element.</p>
<p>So any divergent thinking task would involve exactly that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d show you pictures or play you sounds or words or notes</p>
<p>or describe to you events in history</p>
<p>and try and see how many things can radiate out from that</p>
<p>into diverse, diverse, even distant types of concepts</p>
<p>and pictures, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking is really the process</p>
<p>that underlies idea generation</p>
<p>and the basis of divergent thinking</p>
<p>is that more than one idea is correct.</p>
<p>In fact, the more ideas that you have about one thing,</p>
<p>the better your divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So if I were to give you three minutes</p>
<p>to list off all the things you can think about</p>
<p>related to this pen that I&rsquo;m holding up,</p>
<p>for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just holding up a pen in front of me,</p>
<p>and you just write them out or say them out</p>
<p>over the next three minutes,</p>
<p>that would be an example of divergent thinking.</p>
<p>However, if you just said black pen, red pen, white pen,</p>
<p>green pen, et cetera, that&rsquo;s not very divergent thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only divergent in the context of color space.</p>
<p>When I say space, that&rsquo;s just a kind of nerd speak</p>
<p>for one particular domain of thinking.</p>
<p>Whereas if you said red pen, white pen,</p>
<p>essay, pen in a door to hold the door open</p>
<p>so that someone can return to a building</p>
<p>and you started spooling off a story related to that</p>
<p>and why that was important, well, there you go.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking is essentially taking one element</p>
<p>and coming up with many, many answers.</p>
<p>And in the context of divergent thinking, any answer goes,</p>
<p>but as we&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>not every answer is interesting and relevant.</p>
<p>That is not every answer helps solve something</p>
<p>or reveal something fundamental.</p>
<p>And therefore not every divergent answer is truly creative.</p>
<p>The other aspect of divergent thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>is that the selection criteria are extremely vague and vast.</p>
<p>That is, there are no constraints on what you come up with.</p>
<p>So if I hold up this pen and you say orangutan,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a perfectly valid divergent idea from this pen</p>
<p>because you thought of it and it&rsquo;s distantly related.</p>
<p>However, we have to remember our earlier rule.</p>
<p>If black pen and orangutan are not linked up in our brain,</p>
<p>in the observer&rsquo;s brain, in any kind of meaningful way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only interesting to you</p>
<p>because you are the only one that understands the rule</p>
<p>that underlies the link between this pen and orangutan.</p>
<p>Whereas if you come up with something different</p>
<p>that somehow tells me and everybody else</p>
<p>something interesting about pens or orangutans,</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s a truly creative idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have such an example in mind,</p>
<p>but later I&rsquo;ll give you some examples</p>
<p>of how you can actually march down</p>
<p>the path of divergent thinking</p>
<p>and use that executive network to suppress certain options,</p>
<p>to cross off certain answers.</p>
<p>Because again, any answer&rsquo;s valid,</p>
<p>but not all valid answers are interesting or useful.</p>
<p>And you can cross those off and arrive at the most</p>
<p>interesting and truly creative answer.</p>
<p>A couple more things about divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking largely taps</p>
<p>into the networks of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in mental flexibility.</p>
<p>So this is a different aspect of our prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>which is not based on executive function</p>
<p>and our ability to reduce options,</p>
<p>but rather areas of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that are available to generate multiple options</p>
<p>and actually suppress context, right?</p>
<p>To forget that pens are just for writing, for instance,</p>
<p>and that pens can do other things like hold the door open.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really kind of an unusual use of a pen.</p>
<p>Again, none of these examples that I&rsquo;m giving</p>
<p>are particularly interesting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just designed to get you to understand</p>
<p>the underlying concept of divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And then the last thing I&rsquo;d like you to know</p>
<p>about divergent thinking is that divergent thinking</p>
<p>involves a sort of exploration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wandering through of ideas that you already had</p>
<p>in your library, in your memory banks about pens</p>
<p>and what pens could be related to</p>
<p>and what pens ought not to be related to.</p>
<p>So again, what&rsquo;s really important about creativity</p>
<p>is that there has to be the basic building blocks</p>
<p>already existing within us.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so important to understand</p>
<p>that if you are somebody who really seeks to be creative,</p>
<p>you really do need to be somebody who forages</p>
<p>for information and structured information in particular,</p>
<p>if you are to be creative.</p>
<p>The architect simply can&rsquo;t come up with incredible drawings</p>
<p>or plans for buildings without understanding</p>
<p>how buildings are put together</p>
<p>and the various rules that govern buildings.</p>
<p>In other words, you can&rsquo;t break rules</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I think in movies especially, we have this idea in mind</p>
<p>that of this limitless concept</p>
<p>or that we have these hidden geniuses</p>
<p>that somehow have access to all the math knowledge</p>
<p>without ever having done any formal math.</p>
<p>Actually, I was flying back from Texas recently</p>
<p>and Goodwill Hunting was on somebody&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to watch movies on the plane very often,</p>
<p>sometimes, but not often.</p>
<p>And I was remembering in that movie,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this math genius who is a janitor at MIT,</p>
<p>and apparently just has access to all this knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful concept, a very, very,</p>
<p>I would say even exceedingly rare thing</p>
<p>to occur in the world.</p>
<p>Sure, there are people who seem to have a natural talent</p>
<p>for mathematics or for something else,</p>
<p>but this idea that there are incredible geniuses among us</p>
<p>that just spontaneously have so much knowledge,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s by far the exception rather than the rule, of course,</p>
<p>and may not even actually exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure someone will put in the comments examples</p>
<p>where this actually exists.</p>
<p>More often than not, what you find is that people</p>
<p>who have extreme virtuosity in a given area</p>
<p>put many, many years into developing the basic substrates,</p>
<p>the basic building blocks of whatever it is</p>
<p>their craft happens to be</p>
<p>where they demonstrate virtuosity.</p>
<p>So this is very important to understand.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, divergent thinking is the critical element</p>
<p>for initiating the creative process.</p>
<p>Again, thinking about creativity as a verb.</p>
<p>And divergent thinking involves taking some starting point,</p>
<p>in this case, a pen, and then radiating out from that</p>
<p>in a fairly unconstrained,</p>
<p>what biologists call a random walk,</p>
<p>just kind of wandering through your thought space</p>
<p>and memory space about what could be related to this pen.</p>
<p>Now, on the flip side of creativity</p>
<p>is the implementation of specific combinations of things</p>
<p>and testing those to see whether or not</p>
<p>they are interesting, relevant,</p>
<p>or delight us or other people,</p>
<p>or scare us or other people,</p>
<p>or thrill us or other people.</p>
<p>In other words, a testing of whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some fundamental rule to emerge.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m going to repeat this many, many times</p>
<p>throughout this episode,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to apologize for that</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s so important to understand</p>
<p>that creativity is not just novel combinations.</p>
<p>They are novel combinations of things</p>
<p>that reveal something fundamental</p>
<p>and that often pop out to us.</p>
<p>If not every time,</p>
<p>certainly most of the time that we see that thing.</p>
<p>It almost never seems to be the case</p>
<p>that something truly creative dulls in its expression.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because what it&rsquo;s repeating to us</p>
<p>over and over again is this fundamental rule</p>
<p>that normally we can&rsquo;t see or hear or experience</p>
<p>in the absence of this creative act.</p>
<p>So the second part of creativity where things are tested</p>
<p>and where truly creative elements are discovered</p>
<p>is in convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And convergent thinking is, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>just the opposite of divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Convergent thinking would be, for example,</p>
<p>if I give you an image or I tell you the following things,</p>
<p>I say wing, water, and engine.</p>
<p>The concept that I happen to have in mind</p>
<p>is that of a plane that can land on water, right?</p>
<p>Most planes don&rsquo;t land on water</p>
<p>or not intended to land on water.</p>
<p>One would hope that their plane doesn&rsquo;t land on water</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a plane designed to land on water.</p>
<p>But in this case, a plane that can land on water</p>
<p>is one of the very few answers</p>
<p>that can combine wing, water, and engine, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other answers.</p>
<p>There are other convergent thinking modes</p>
<p>that can take you to an answer that would be valid,</p>
<p>but there are not many.</p>
<p>And here, what&rsquo;s really most important</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m not asking you to spool out</p>
<p>or to radiate out from these three things.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;m asking you to combine them in some way</p>
<p>that makes sense in the real world.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are planes that can land on water.</p>
<p>And wing, water, and engine combined within those things,</p>
<p>they are fundamental features.</p>
<p>They are in fact necessary, but not sufficient</p>
<p>for having a plane that can land on water.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s just one example of convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And a convergent thinking task</p>
<p>would involve you being given a list of two or three</p>
<p>or maybe even five different things.</p>
<p>And then for each of those two or three</p>
<p>or five different things,</p>
<p>as quickly as you can to come up with a single answer</p>
<p>that binds all of those in a real world concept</p>
<p>that obey the laws of nature or physics in some way.</p>
<p>For instance, you could just come up with some, you know,</p>
<p>answer that said a bird that swallowed an engine</p>
<p>and that happens to be a seabird.</p>
<p>You could come up with that,</p>
<p>but that actually is not something that happens</p>
<p>or is that very typical at all.</p>
<p>And so it seems like kind of a mishmash</p>
<p>of things that are really just designed</p>
<p>for you to try and accomplish an answer</p>
<p>rather than something real,</p>
<p>such as a plane that lands on water, okay?</p>
<p>The point here is that divergent thinking</p>
<p>is one aspect of our cognition, of our thinking,</p>
<p>and convergent thinking is a very distinct aspect</p>
<p>of our cognition.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the critical requirements</p>
<p>for convergent thinking is also to access our memory banks</p>
<p>and our understanding about the outside world,</p>
<p>just as it were with divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but it requires more focus and more persistence.</p>
<p>In fact, if we were to come up with a key rule</p>
<p>for divergent thinking, it would be,</p>
<p>you almost want to have just enough focus</p>
<p>to remember what the initial object</p>
<p>or thing that was mentioned was to keep that in mind</p>
<p>so that your answers don&rsquo;t become completely random.</p>
<p>But the more distant and everywhere in between</p>
<p>that you can generate answers,</p>
<p>that is the things that are very close to pens,</p>
<p>you know, black pen, red pen versus, you know,</p>
<p>pen and doorstop, pen acting as a doorstop.</p>
<p>Those are, one is very close.</p>
<p>Red pen is very close to black pen.</p>
<p>Doorstop is pretty far from black pen.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea is that you want to explore</p>
<p>and undergo a range of exploration of different ideas.</p>
<p>Whereas with convergent thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really trying to bind these things together.</p>
<p>And so the key element for convergent thinking</p>
<p>is the aspect of persistence and focus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why convergent thinking in many ways</p>
<p>feels harder than divergent thinking.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s an answer</p>
<p>and I want to get the answer right and I can&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a puzzle and it&rsquo;s a puzzle</p>
<p>that relies on very distinct brain circuits</p>
<p>from divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Which brain circuits?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to describe next.</p>
<p>And again, this is not just going to be a list</p>
<p>of different brain circuits</p>
<p>with different names, doing different things.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be useful to you or to me.</p>
<p>Rather, what you&rsquo;re about to learn is truly incredible.</p>
<p>What it is, is we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>one single molecule, dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule most typically associated</p>
<p>with motivation and desire and drive</p>
<p>and feelings of pleasure in some cases,</p>
<p>but that actually resides within</p>
<p>four different networks in the brain.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about two of those networks.</p>
<p>And dopamine acting in one network</p>
<p>directly underlies divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Whereas dopamine in another brain network</p>
<p>underlies convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And if at this point in this episode, you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>okay, when am I going to get the tools</p>
<p>to understand creativity and how to be creative?</p>
<p>What I can assure you is that</p>
<p>if you understand divergent thinking,</p>
<p>which hopefully now you do,</p>
<p>and you can understand what convergent thinking is,</p>
<p>and you can understand that dopamine is responsible</p>
<p>for both divergent thinking and convergent thinking,</p>
<p>but through separate pathways,</p>
<p>well then, if you can understand</p>
<p>how those two separate pathways work</p>
<p>and how to engage them differentially,</p>
<p>therein lie the tools that you can use</p>
<p>both to explore ideas, in other words,</p>
<p>find what it is that could be creative,</p>
<p>and then systematically test each of those ideas</p>
<p>for what is truly creative.</p>
<p>That is what meets the criteria</p>
<p>for something that is novel and truly useful</p>
<p>and informs us about something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never seen, heard, or felt before.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take a moment to talk about</p>
<p>the incredible molecule that is dopamine.</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with dopamine</p>
<p>from the concept of quote-unquote dopamine hits,</p>
<p>which is popular language describing</p>
<p>the feeling of pleasure that we get</p>
<p>from pretty much anything that we like</p>
<p>or that we continue to engage in repeatedly.</p>
<p>So some people will talk about the dopamine hit</p>
<p>that they get from somebody attractive</p>
<p>that they like texting them back,</p>
<p>or the dopamine hit that they get from social media,</p>
<p>or the dopamine hit that they get from sugar,</p>
<p>or the dopamine hit that they get from this or from that.</p>
<p>To be honest, the concept of dopamine hits</p>
<p>is not one that I favor because in general,</p>
<p>whenever people talk about dopamine hits,</p>
<p>typically they&rsquo;re talking about activities</p>
<p>such as social media,</p>
<p>which dopamine may be involved at some level,</p>
<p>but often it&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that the behavior associated with that thing,</p>
<p>in this case, social media,</p>
<p>is more of the compulsive nature</p>
<p>rather than an active seeking of something</p>
<p>with positive anticipation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what dopamine is about,</p>
<p>at least in the context of one of its major functions</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>Dopamine is really about motivation and desire and movement.</p>
<p>And it makes sense why motivation, desire, and movement</p>
<p>would be linked up through a common,</p>
<p>in this case, neuromodulator or chemical like dopamine,</p>
<p>because throughout evolution,</p>
<p>if we were excited for or motivated to pursue something,</p>
<p>we had to move in order to get it, to obtain it.</p>
<p>And in general, we can frame dopamine under the umbrella</p>
<p>of dopamine tends to be involved</p>
<p>in neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in processes</p>
<p>that are taking us beyond the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>That is, that motivate us to go do something</p>
<p>in terms of action in the world.</p>
<p>Now, that statement might seem distantly placed</p>
<p>from a discussion about creativity,</p>
<p>but as we&rsquo;ll learn a little bit later,</p>
<p>one of the most useful tools for engaging creativity</p>
<p>and becoming more creative</p>
<p>is to think about action elements within a narrative.</p>
<p>That is things that we and others can do</p>
<p>in order to discover new rules through actual movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit cryptic, forgive me,</p>
<p>but I promise I&rsquo;ll return to it later</p>
<p>and I will make it crystal clear.</p>
<p>There are four major circuits in the brain that use dopamine</p>
<p>although I should mention</p>
<p>there are additional circuits as well.</p>
<p>In fact, your eye even contains neurons</p>
<p>that release dopamine that control the sensitivity</p>
<p>of your eye at different times of day to light, et cetera.</p>
<p>The four major circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that utilize dopamine, however,</p>
<p>are used for four major purposes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll describe what those are.</p>
<p>First of all, is a neural circuit that uses dopamine</p>
<p>among other things, but certainly relies on dopamine</p>
<p>in a critical way to engage movement,</p>
<p>including eye movements.</p>
<p>And we will return to eye movements</p>
<p>and why they&rsquo;re so important for understanding creativity</p>
<p>and maybe even for generating creativity a little bit later.</p>
<p>The name of the circuit, again,</p>
<p>is less important than what it does,</p>
<p>but the name of this circuit, for those that want to know,</p>
<p>is the so-called nigrostriatal pathway, okay?</p>
<p>The substantia nigra is a brain area that is very dark</p>
<p>that projects to an area called the dorsal striatum.</p>
<p>It contains a bunch of sub-regions.</p>
<p>So again, for those of you</p>
<p>that really geek out on this stuff, great.</p>
<p>You can learn these names and retain them in your memory.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about names, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Just discard the names.</p>
<p>But areas of the brain like the caudate and putatum</p>
<p>and the dorsal striatum receive input</p>
<p>from the substantia nigra.</p>
<p>In neuroanatomy, when we name something,</p>
<p>we say the origin of that thing and where it connects through.</p>
<p>So nigrostriatal tells you that there is a connection</p>
<p>between the substantia nigra,</p>
<p>because it came first, nigrostriatal,</p>
<p>and then striatal is where it ends up.</p>
<p>So nigrostriatal pathway is involved</p>
<p>in generating bodily movements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in eye movements,</p>
<p>and it is actually a brain area that&rsquo;s engaged</p>
<p>when you think about movement.</p>
<p>Even just have a story in your mind about walking</p>
<p>or a story in your mind about running</p>
<p>or a story in your mind about driving,</p>
<p>this area is engaged.</p>
<p>Very interesting brain area.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first circuit.</p>
<p>Very important to understand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you right now,</p>
<p>that is the brain circuit that is engaged</p>
<p>when you undergo divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Now that itself should be interesting, right?</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t remember any of the names</p>
<p>of the things I just told you,</p>
<p>that you have a brain circuit</p>
<p>that even if you just think about walking,</p>
<p>it becomes more active,</p>
<p>and the dopamine is involved in that brain activity.</p>
<p>And if you recall,</p>
<p>divergent thinking involves taking a concept</p>
<p>as boring as a pen and thinking about other concepts</p>
<p>that could link up with that pen in some sort of way,</p>
<p>logical or illogical, right?</p>
<p>The bridge could be completely abstract</p>
<p>and really fantastical with a bunch of different ideas</p>
<p>in between, like a pen acting as a doorstop</p>
<p>because of some situation</p>
<p>where you need to run downstairs in a fire</p>
<p>and get back upstairs quickly</p>
<p>to rescue somebody very divergent</p>
<p>or as divergent as black pen to red pen.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s amazing is that that same circuit</p>
<p>is the one that&rsquo;s involved in physical movement,</p>
<p>in generating and thinking about physical movement.</p>
<p>That turns out to be vitally important</p>
<p>for tapping into the creativity process.</p>
<p>So really frame that up in your mind</p>
<p>or commit it to memory.</p>
<p>Now, the second dopamine circuit associated with creativity</p>
<p>is the one associated with convergent thinking,</p>
<p>which again is the kind of thinking</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a specific correct answer,</p>
<p>it requires focus and it requires persistence.</p>
<p>And the name of that circuit,</p>
<p>again, the name isn&rsquo;t as important as what it does,</p>
<p>but the name of that circuit is the mesocortical pathway.</p>
<p>The mesocortical pathway is involved in motivation</p>
<p>and it has an emotional component too.</p>
<p>Now, it will become clear in a few minutes</p>
<p>why that emotional component is vital.</p>
<p>But this is a circuit that originates in a brain structure</p>
<p>called the lateral ventral tegmental area.</p>
<p>Again, a bunch of words,</p>
<p>you can remember it if you want,</p>
<p>lateral ventral tegmental area,</p>
<p>or you can not worry about the name.</p>
<p>And it connects to the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>that area just behind the forehead.</p>
<p>And this mesocortical area</p>
<p>is involved in motivation and emotion</p>
<p>and is critical for focus and persistence.</p>
<p>It is distinct from a very nearby area,</p>
<p>just sitting right next door,</p>
<p>the so-called mesolimbic area,</p>
<p>which is involved in desire and feelings of reward.</p>
<p>And this is the area that is associated more typically</p>
<p>with addictive behaviors or compulsive behaviors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to leave out the discussion</p>
<p>about the mesolimbic pathway for now,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not critical to divergent</p>
<p>or convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not critical to the process of creativity,</p>
<p>at least as far as we know.</p>
<p>But I mentioned it because it is the third</p>
<p>in the four dopaminergic circuits.</p>
<p>And then the fourth circuit,</p>
<p>certainly one I&rsquo;ve never talked about before</p>
<p>in this podcast, which doesn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>except that we haven&rsquo;t gotten to it yet,</p>
<p>is the tubero-infrandibular pathway.</p>
<p>And that is the pathway associated with dopamine</p>
<p>and your pituitary gland and the release of hormones</p>
<p>in particular that travel to the ovary.</p>
<p>If you have ovaries or to your testes,</p>
<p>if you have testes and trigger the release of things</p>
<p>like estrogen and testosterone, et cetera,</p>
<p>dopamine is intimately involved in that circuitry.</p>
<p>Again, not the topic of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>For today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we want to remember that there&rsquo;s a dopamine circuit</p>
<p>called the nigrostriatal circuit,</p>
<p>which is involved in movement and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And that alone should set a flag up for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, just thinking about new ideas</p>
<p>has something to do with movement, with physical movement.</p>
<p>And the dopamine circuit that is the mesocortical pathway,</p>
<p>which is the one that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with motivation and emotion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one required for persistence and focus</p>
<p>for convergent thinking.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all of this about dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that dopamine</p>
<p>creates a certain number of responses in the brain and body</p>
<p>when it is active in one or the other of these circuits.</p>
<p>And just for sake of simplicity,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t have to keep saying nigrostriatal</p>
<p>and mesocortical, here going forward,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about the dopamine circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with divergent thinking</p>
<p>or the dopamine circuit associated with convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And again, divergent thinking and convergent thinking</p>
<p>are the two processes that have to occur,</p>
<p>usually first divergent, then convergent thinking,</p>
<p>then back and forth and back and forth</p>
<p>in order to arrive at something creative.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking is about exploration.</p>
<p>Convergent thinking is about testing things</p>
<p>and coming up with things that are the right answer,</p>
<p>that feel right.</p>
<p>And we will better define what right means</p>
<p>a little bit later, but you already sort of know.</p>
<p>Right in this context is when you have</p>
<p>some combination of elements or some idea</p>
<p>or some written passage or some music</p>
<p>or some physical action that you just know,</p>
<p>this is really novel and really cool,</p>
<p>or people see it or hear it or taste it</p>
<p>and say, this is really novel and really cool.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t necessarily know why,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just different in a way that feels true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids and hormones and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate</p>

<p>Now, I realize that for some of you</p>
<p>listening to this episode,</p>
<p>we are probably at the point along the pathway</p>
<p>of concept and definition and mechanism</p>
<p>that leaves you in a place of real wanting a tool.</p>
<p>And so I promise that I&rsquo;m going to get into more tools,</p>
<p>but to satisfy you and to make sure</p>
<p>that you do indeed understand that there are tools</p>
<p>that can emerge from the information</p>
<p>that you already now have in mind,</p>
<p>I do want to share with you one particular tool</p>
<p>from the literature that has been demonstrated</p>
<p>over and over again to support and build</p>
<p>and enhance divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And I also want to share with you a tool</p>
<p>that has been shown from the scientific literature</p>
<p>to enhance convergent thinking,</p>
<p>because both convergent and divergent thinking</p>
<p>are critical for the creative process.</p>
<p>Now, I should emphasize that some people out there,</p>
<p>either by training or by genetics or by both,</p>
<p>will be naturally better</p>
<p>at divergent or convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And in fact, we now know in a kind of almost poetic</p>
<p>kind of way that naturally occurring variations in genes,</p>
<p>which underlie naturally occurring variations</p>
<p>in the percentage of dopamine</p>
<p>in one set of brain circuits versus another,</p>
<p>do seem to relate to whether or not people</p>
<p>are naturally good at divergent thinking</p>
<p>or convergent thinking.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very nature-based explanation</p>
<p>for why some people are better at divergent thinking</p>
<p>and other people are better at convergent thinking.</p>
<p>Nature and nurture is something</p>
<p>that can never really be teased apart exactly,</p>
<p>because of course, if someone has a natural proclivity</p>
<p>for something based on their genes,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t often separate that from their parents</p>
<p>because we inherit our genes from our parents.</p>
<p>Although, even in cases where people are raised away</p>
<p>from their parents through adoption, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to separate nature and nurture</p>
<p>because somebody with a natural proclivity for things</p>
<p>might engage in those things more, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The point is that for those of you</p>
<p>that are very, very good at divergent thinking</p>
<p>or very, very good at convergent thinking,</p>
<p>some of that might&rsquo;ve been inherited,</p>
<p>but more than likely some of that depended</p>
<p>on the kinds of activities that you engaged in</p>
<p>in your early years,</p>
<p>in particular in the years between age five and 25.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are aged between five and 25,</p>
<p>all I can say is please learn to engage</p>
<p>both divergent and convergent thinking</p>
<p>as much as possible</p>
<p>because you will enhance your ability for both.</p>
<p>For those of you 25 and older,</p>
<p>you can still enhance your ability</p>
<p>to engage divergent and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And the fortunate news, the equalizer, I should say,</p>
<p>is that regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you are naturally better at divergent or convergent thinking</p>
<p>or you acquired it through activities,</p>
<p>you need both in order to be creative.</p>
<p>So what we know is that in order to engage</p>
<p>divergent thinking, we need access to our memory banks.</p>
<p>We need to come up with possibilities</p>
<p>and those possibilities can only come</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s contained within our memory systems</p>
<p>of our brain, areas like the hippocampus, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the names again, don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We just know that if we are going to come up</p>
<p>with novel combinations of things or novel uses of things</p>
<p>or totally new ideas about how objects or notes of music</p>
<p>or foods or tastes or whatever can be combined,</p>
<p>we have to do that with preexisting knowledge.</p>
<p>And yet what we need to do</p>
<p>in order to engage divergent thinking</p>
<p>is suppress what is called autobiographical narratives.</p>
<p>And in particular autobiographical narratives,</p>
<p>we need to discard with judgments</p>
<p>about how certain combinations of things</p>
<p>impacted us in the past.</p>
<p>Now, this is, I think is what people mean</p>
<p>when they encourage the exploration of creativity</p>
<p>by so-called boundary exploration.</p>
<p>You hear about this a lot</p>
<p>in kind of the self-help and psychology literature.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not at all disparaging of that literature,</p>
<p>although rarely does it define exactly how and why</p>
<p>to go about being more creative in the,</p>
<p>or in this case, to be more divergent in our thinking.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll say, you have to take risks</p>
<p>or you have to suppress judgment,</p>
<p>but how do you actually do that?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a wonderful paper</p>
<p>that talks about one way to do it.</p>
<p>One way to do it is what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>or even just open monitoring thinking.</p>
<p>And just to make what could otherwise</p>
<p>be a somewhat complex section here very simple,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll also tell you</p>
<p>is that if you want to enhance convergent thinking,</p>
<p>you can do that a number of ways,</p>
<p>but you can do that in particular</p>
<p>by doing a different type of meditation or thought process,</p>
<p>which is called focused attention meditation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s so useful for enhancing divergent thinking,</p>
<p>this critical element of the creative process.</p>
<p>First of all, open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>and focused attention meditation</p>
<p>can be performed the exact same way physically.</p>
<p>You can sit there, eyes closed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re in a lotus position,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lying down, you&rsquo;re standing up.</p>
<p>You could in theory do open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>with eyes open,</p>
<p>and that would be an interesting variant on it.</p>
<p>But for sake of the discussion right now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just focus on the study</p>
<p>that talks about these specific tools</p>
<p>and the way that they were used in the study.</p>
<p>The title of the paper that I&rsquo;m essentially summarizing</p>
<p>is called open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>reduces the involvement of brain regions</p>
<p>related to memory function.</p>
<p>Now, right off the bat,</p>
<p>that should cue you to something interesting.</p>
<p>Something about divergent thinking and open monitoring</p>
<p>is related to suppressing memory.</p>
<p>But as you recall, just a few moments ago,</p>
<p>I said that in order to engage in divergent thinking,</p>
<p>you need to kind of kill off the narratives</p>
<p>of what has to be related to what</p>
<p>and come up with new narratives.</p>
<p>You still need to understand possibilities,</p>
<p>but you need to forget prior understanding</p>
<p>of what those possibilities have to be</p>
<p>and start thinking about what those possibilities could be.</p>
<p>And so that it turns out involves suppression</p>
<p>of certain brain areas.</p>
<p>Open monitoring meditation is typically done</p>
<p>for about 10 to 30 minutes, although it could be longer.</p>
<p>And unlike other forms of meditation</p>
<p>where you sit and concentrate on your breathing</p>
<p>and trying to redirect your thinking back to your breathing</p>
<p>or to your posture or to a chant or a mantra,</p>
<p>open monitoring meditation is simply a matter</p>
<p>of having you sit there or lie down, close your eyes</p>
<p>and to allow whatever surfaces in your mind to surface.</p>
<p>And what you practice is the practice of non-judgment.</p>
<p>Now, non-judgment itself is a little bit of an abstract theme</p>
<p>because of course, the moment you say, don&rsquo;t judge,</p>
<p>you and others start to judge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>You say, don&rsquo;t think about an elephant,</p>
<p>you think about an elephant, that&rsquo;s a perfectly natural.</p>
<p>You go to an edge of a bridge or a cliff</p>
<p>and you think about jumping off</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t, please don&rsquo;t, jump off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s part of the circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keeping you from jumping off</p>
<p>is the thought about what would happen if you did, okay?</p>
<p>So open monitoring meditation involves dedicating</p>
<p>a certain amount of time where you close your eyes</p>
<p>and whatever thoughts arise, whatever emotions arise,</p>
<p>whatever ideas arise, to watch those</p>
<p>and take an inventory of them,</p>
<p>to just merely watch them show up and pass</p>
<p>or maybe you become fixated on them for some period of time</p>
<p>or maybe even just one for a long period of time.</p>
<p>All of that is fine.</p>
<p>In other words, whatever surfaces, surfaces.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s open monitoring meditation.</p>
<p>And that we know from brain imaging studies</p>
<p>and we know from measurements of dopamine</p>
<p>in particular brain circuits.</p>
<p>And we know from people who train</p>
<p>with open monitoring meditation on a regular basis</p>
<p>improves divergent thinking capability.</p>
<p>So in terms of tools, practicing open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>or what I would just call open monitoring thinking</p>
<p>is going to be immensely useful.</p>
<p>And this is actually an opportunity to cue up something</p>
<p>that I mentioned in our episode on meditation</p>
<p>which goes deep into the different kinds of meditation</p>
<p>involving focus inward and outward, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to check out that episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>But the point is that rather than think about</p>
<p>the word meditation, which carries a bunch of ideas</p>
<p>about what it is and what it isn&rsquo;t and how to do it,</p>
<p>meditation is really just a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>For instance, you could do a meditation</p>
<p>where you look at a single point on a wall for five minutes</p>
<p>and redirect your focus to that single point on a wall</p>
<p>over and over again every time your mind drifts</p>
<p>as it no doubt would, or to a tone in the room,</p>
<p>you can attend to that and redirect to that.</p>
<p>Rather than think about as a meditation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really just a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that meditation is.</p>
<p>So open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>is really just a form of perception</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re perceiving your thoughts</p>
<p>without laying judgment to those thoughts</p>
<p>or trying not to lay judgment to those thoughts.</p>
<p>And what people find is that they very quickly</p>
<p>within a few days get better</p>
<p>at doing open monitoring meditation.</p>
<p>And fortunately within just a few days</p>
<p>and certainly within about a week or more of practice,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be daily practice.</p>
<p>So although of course daily practice</p>
<p>will accelerate the process further,</p>
<p>people become significantly better at divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the dopamine circuits</p>
<p>and in particular along the nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>becoming more active.</p>
<p>And the wonderful thing is that when you repeat a practice</p>
<p>and a particular neural circuit</p>
<p>is engaged over and over again deliberately,</p>
<p>that neural circuit becomes easier to engage,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So I would encourage any of you</p>
<p>that want to explore the creative process</p>
<p>for whatever reason or get better at the creative process,</p>
<p>dedicate some amount of time,</p>
<p>maybe even just five minutes every other day</p>
<p>to doing this open monitoring meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried this meditation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite fun to do</p>
<p>because at least to me it feels a lot easier</p>
<p>than the meditation associated with convergent thinking.</p>
<p>Now, the convergent thinking meditation</p>
<p>is the so-called focus attention meditation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also described in the same study</p>
<p>and other studies have explored</p>
<p>which particular brain networks it involves.</p>
<p>And I can just tell you that focused attention meditation,</p>
<p>which you can think of,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;d prefer that you think of</p>
<p>just as a perceptual exercise,</p>
<p>involves sitting or lying down,</p>
<p>closing your eyes, focusing either on your breath</p>
<p>or some element of your body,</p>
<p>could be the tops of your knees or the clasp of your hands.</p>
<p>It could be focusing on an auditory tone,</p>
<p>you could even do it eyes open</p>
<p>and stare at a point on a wall or a flame of light,</p>
<p>whatever it happens to be</p>
<p>that allows you to redirect your focus</p>
<p>to a particular location or idea or sound,</p>
<p>that is known to improve your ability</p>
<p>to engage convergent thinking,</p>
<p>to quickly parse through</p>
<p>or analyze a bunch of different choices</p>
<p>and to persist in choice selection</p>
<p>and therefore more rapidly arrive at the correct answer.</p>
<p>This is well-established and in fact,</p>
<p>in the episode that I did with a wonderful guest,</p>
<p>Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,</p>
<p>she talked about how a daily meditation</p>
<p>of about 10 to 13 minutes performed for about eight weeks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they explored.</p>
<p>And that study greatly increases people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to focus and in fact, their memory.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly the point,</p>
<p>which is that convergent thinking,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>requires persistence, focus and access to specific memories.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who wants to get better at focusing,</p>
<p>that is the meditation for you.</p>
<p>However, because today we&rsquo;re talking about creativity,</p>
<p>if you are somebody who wants to get better</p>
<p>at divergent thinking and convergent thinking,</p>
<p>the two elements of creativity, that is,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to do a dual meditation,</p>
<p>that is a meditation that starts with open monitoring</p>
<p>for maybe five to 10 minutes</p>
<p>and then transitions to focused attention</p>
<p>for maybe five to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Because the positioning of divergent thinking</p>
<p>and then convergent thinking close together,</p>
<p>more closely resembles what the creative process really is</p>
<p>and what it typically involves.</p>
<p>Most of us would love to have a situation</p>
<p>where we can spend a morning or a day or a week</p>
<p>brainstorming, just kind of brainstorming.</p>
<p>Whatever we think about is fine, that&rsquo;s divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Whatever elements, just throw them up on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>We sometimes see people and companies doing this at retreats</p>
<p>and you bring people into a novel environment.</p>
<p>You say, let&rsquo;s just forget all the rules</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just come up with new ideas about something,</p>
<p>new uses of something, new strategies,</p>
<p>and nothing is too crazy, nothing&rsquo;s off limits.</p>
<p>And sure, that&rsquo;s a useful exercise, so-called brainstorming.</p>
<p>But at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the requirement to cross off things.</p>
<p>And typically that&rsquo;s done later in the retreat</p>
<p>or later in the meeting or later in the weekend.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a wonderful way to approach creativity</p>
<p>and to try and be creative.</p>
<p>But not a lot of people train for that on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So what I just described to you</p>
<p>are research tested tools for training</p>
<p>for divergent thinking and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And I would encourage people who are interested</p>
<p>in being more creative to try and do these</p>
<p>on a somewhat regular basis.</p>
<p>If not every day,</p>
<p>then certainly a few times a week or more.</p>
<p>Certainly the more you do it,</p>
<p>the better you&rsquo;re going to get at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well demonstrated in the literature.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s very consistent</p>
<p>doing maybe five minutes of open monitoring meditation</p>
<p>and five minutes immediately after</p>
<p>of focused attention meditation daily,</p>
<p>you can expect that you will get very, very good</p>
<p>at these processes very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to go into a lengthy description</p>
<p>of the different lines of evidence</p>
<p>that the corresponding areas of the brain are active</p>
<p>in each of these different kinds of meditation.</p>
<p>But what I can tell you is that there&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>some beautiful, what are called loss of function studies</p>
<p>where particular brain areas are either depleted of dopamine</p>
<p>or where dopamine in some cases,</p>
<p>I guess what we would call gain of function studies,</p>
<p>although not the kind of gain of function studies</p>
<p>associated with virology,</p>
<p>different gain of function studies</p>
<p>where you enhance the level of dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>What you find is that both divergent</p>
<p>and convergent thinking are enhanced</p>
<p>when levels of dopamine are elevated.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re not necessarily talking about pharmacology here.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are other ways to elevate dopamine</p>
<p>that make us better at divergent and convergent thinking</p>
<p>in particular by using mood.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;d like to talk about how,</p>
<p>what mood you are in</p>
<p>when you happen to start a creative process</p>
<p>or try and do a sort of training</p>
<p>such as open monitoring meditation or focus meditation,</p>
<p>how your mood relates to your level of dopamine at baseline,</p>
<p>what we call your sort of tonic as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>meaning consistent or ongoing level of dopamine,</p>
<p>how that dictates whether or not you are going to be better</p>
<p>at one particular aspect of the creative process or another</p>
<p>and how you can enhance your creativity</p>
<p>in the very short term, very quickly using tools</p>
<p>that are known to trigger additional release of dopamine,</p>
<p>which in some cases is good</p>
<p>and in some cases is bad, I should mention.</p>
<p>And in other words,</p>
<p>determine how you feel in one moment</p>
<p>should dictate what sort of tool you should use</p>
<p>in order to become more creative.</p>
<p>The relationship between mood and creativity</p>
<p>is a fascinating one that is bridged by one main feature,</p>
<p>which is the amount of dopamine present</p>
<p>in this nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really wonderful correlate</p>
<p>or measure of the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s active in that pathway</p>
<p>that can be addressed non-invasively in the laboratory.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>is involved in movement and in eye blinking,</p>
<p>which of course is a movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a movement of the sort that we typically think of</p>
<p>when we think of movements,</p>
<p>but nonetheless it relies on dopamine levels in this pathway</p>
<p>and in fact, we can state very confidently</p>
<p>that when dopamine levels are elevated,</p>
<p>the blinking reflex is more active.</p>
<p>People just blink more.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are lower</p>
<p>or less active in this pathway,</p>
<p>people tend to blink less.</p>
<p>So blink frequency is a common measure</p>
<p>in studies of dopamine within this pathway</p>
<p>that relate to creativity.</p>
<p>The work that I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>is largely the work of two authors</p>
<p>who have done wonderful work across several papers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, their names are difficult to pronounce</p>
<p>so I apologize to them and their relatives</p>
<p>for what is sure to be incorrect pronunciation.</p>
<p>But the last names of these authors</p>
<p>are Cermahini and Hommel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>So Cermahini and Hommel done a number of different papers</p>
<p>or studies rather of the relationship</p>
<p>between blinking mood and creativity,</p>
<p>in particular divergent thinking.</p>
<p>What they found is that if people are blinking fairly often</p>
<p>and they measure their mood through subjective tests</p>
<p>and if they were to do brain imaging,</p>
<p>which other studies have done,</p>
<p>they find is that those people</p>
<p>can engage in divergent thinking very easily.</p>
<p>In other words, being in a good mood</p>
<p>facilitates divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might immediately say, well, duh.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a good mood,</p>
<p>you can kind of be more playful about the exploration</p>
<p>about what could happen with these notes of music</p>
<p>or these foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so obvious because it turns out</p>
<p>that if your dopamine levels are very, very high</p>
<p>and this can be measured non-invasively</p>
<p>through the frequency of blinks</p>
<p>or it can be measured more invasively through brain imaging,</p>
<p>even through blood draws</p>
<p>or other methods to measure dopamine.</p>
<p>If dopamine levels are very, very high,</p>
<p>what you observe is that divergent thinking</p>
<p>is actually very, very poor.</p>
<p>Now, a naturally occurring, truly pathological example</p>
<p>of this would be something like manic bipolar disorder</p>
<p>where somebody is in the manic phase</p>
<p>or somebody who has taken methamphetamine or cocaine.</p>
<p>What tends to happen is that they have lots</p>
<p>and lots of ideas.</p>
<p>All of those ideas seem really exciting to them.</p>
<p>But if you were to talk to them for any given moment,</p>
<p>they would be very fixated</p>
<p>on one particular tunnel of ideas.</p>
<p>And by being fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas,</p>
<p>like the idea that they&rsquo;re going to run</p>
<p>for president tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately typical of people who have bipolar,</p>
<p>which is not to say that everybody who runs</p>
<p>for president is bipolar.</p>
<p>Rather, people who are bipolar often have these delusions</p>
<p>of grandeur that they&rsquo;re somehow going to be president</p>
<p>simply because they decided to</p>
<p>and that they were selected to do this, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Ideas about themselves and other people</p>
<p>that are very constrained.</p>
<p>In other words, not very divergent.</p>
<p>So divergent thinking is favored</p>
<p>by having elevated levels of dopamine, but not too high.</p>
<p>Well, that of course creates a conundrum.</p>
<p>How do you know how much dopamine you need</p>
<p>and how to achieve those elevated levels of dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, leaving aside people who are suffering</p>
<p>from a manic episode,</p>
<p>what Cermahini and Homel have discovered is</p>
<p>that if people are in sort of a low mood,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not feeling great.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re depressed,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just not feeling that great.</p>
<p>They feel, you know, on a scale of one to 10</p>
<p>around a two or a three, maybe a four.</p>
<p>The probability that they will be able to engage effectively</p>
<p>in divergent thinking is quite low.</p>
<p>However, the good news is they are typically</p>
<p>very susceptible to elevations in mood</p>
<p>through observing or hearing positive stories,</p>
<p>listening to music that they like,</p>
<p>any kind of so-called inspirational stimuli.</p>
<p>What this means is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s not feeling very motivated</p>
<p>to engage in divergent thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not feeling very creative,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling a little low,</p>
<p>the thing to do in that case is actually</p>
<p>to take external stimuli,</p>
<p>things that you know that you like</p>
<p>and start interacting with those stimuli</p>
<p>to get your mood elevated</p>
<p>and then to engage in divergent thinking.</p>
<p>However, what Cermahini and Homel have also shown is</p>
<p>that if people are already in a very good mood,</p>
<p>elevating dopamine further is not conducive</p>
<p>and in fact is detrimental to divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And in that case, they would be better off,</p>
<p>for example, not engaging in any activities</p>
<p>or you know, taking anything in the way of pharmacology</p>
<p>that would further increase their dopamine</p>
<p>and probably limiting the amount of external stimuli</p>
<p>that are coming in through music and visual stimuli</p>
<p>and really focusing on divergent thinking</p>
<p>in the creative process immediately.</p>
<p>Now, this is important.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode,</p>
<p>both on bipolar and on other forms of depression,</p>
<p>I talked about how rates of bipolar manic episodes</p>
<p>and dopamine levels and creativity tend to be correlated.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, rates of suicide</p>
<p>are 20 to 30 times higher</p>
<p>in people who have bipolar disorder as well.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole dark side to the bipolar disorder</p>
<p>that makes it a very, very dangerous</p>
<p>and important disorder to treat.</p>
<p>But for sake of the discussion of creativity,</p>
<p>what this means is that we all need to develop</p>
<p>some sort of intuitive sense</p>
<p>as to whether or not our mood is,</p>
<p>suppose we could bend this into three categories,</p>
<p>is kind of yes, you know, happy, excited, positive mood.</p>
<p>And of course, there are going to be levels to that.</p>
<p>Low, kind of like mm, or kind of meh,</p>
<p>kind of in the middle.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a low mood or kind of meh mood,</p>
<p>by all means, engage in something</p>
<p>probably for about five to 30 minutes</p>
<p>that elevates your mood</p>
<p>before trying to engage in divergent thinking.</p>
<p>However, if you happen to be in a pretty positive mood,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not 10 out of 10 on mood,</p>
<p>then bringing in additional stimuli</p>
<p>to increase your levels of dopamine will not help you</p>
<p>and in fact can hurt the divergent thinking process.</p>
<p>So in that case, I would also encourage you</p>
<p>to think about something that was discussed</p>
<p>on a previous episode,</p>
<p>which is the particular effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into caffeine a little bit later,</p>
<p>but just very briefly,</p>
<p>caffeine increases levels of dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that caffeine is bad.</p>
<p>In fact, caffeine can be neuroprotective,</p>
<p>it can enhance focus and so forth.</p>
<p>But divergent thinking is sort of anti-focus.</p>
<p>It requires just enough focus</p>
<p>to be able to come up with new ideas,</p>
<p>but you actually don&rsquo;t want to be overly focused.</p>
<p>Focus is more conducive to conversion thinking.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what the literature shows,</p>
<p>is that caffeine,</p>
<p>because its effects on epinephrine and related systems</p>
<p>in the brain like adenosine,</p>
<p>but mainly because of its effects on persistence and focus</p>
<p>is very conducive to convergent thinking.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants to explore creativity</p>
<p>and wants to get better at creativity,</p>
<p>you now know that you need to engage in divergent thinking</p>
<p>and then afterwards convergent thinking.</p>
<p>I would recommend not using stimulants such as caffeine</p>
<p>prior to divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but rather use stimulants</p>
<p>if you do want to use stimulants such as caffeine</p>
<p>prior to convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And in fact, in formulating the architecture</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>which took me many hours across many different days,</p>
<p>I confess, I actually decided to try this.</p>
<p>In trying to imagine the different configurations</p>
<p>and ways that this information can be organized,</p>
<p>I deliberately abstained from caffeine</p>
<p>during those bouts of work.</p>
<p>And when structuring everything</p>
<p>according to the decisions I had already made,</p>
<p>I purposely ingested caffeine prior to that.</p>
<p>Now, of course, constructing a podcast episode</p>
<p>is not really the ultimate example of a creative act</p>
<p>because of course it&rsquo;s taking existing information,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s arranging it in novel ways,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily allow key concepts</p>
<p>to pop out in the way that for instance,</p>
<p>Banksy or Rothko or an Escher would pop out, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not naive in thinking that it does,</p>
<p>but the principle is what&rsquo;s important here.</p>
<p>You need divergent thinking, you need convergent thinking.</p>
<p>You need some level of elevated dopamine</p>
<p>in order to engage in divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but not so high that it starts to inhibit that process.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to come into the laboratory,</p>
<p>this could be measured by your frequency of blinking.</p>
<p>For better, for worse,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t actually count the number of times that we blink</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re actively paying attention to it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t recommend that you pay attention to your blinking</p>
<p>because that will take you off course</p>
<p>from all the other important things of your life.</p>
<p>And how many times you&rsquo;re blinking</p>
<p>is rarely an important thing for you to pay attention to.</p>
<p>You can, however, learn to calibrate your mood,</p>
<p>that is to assess your mood,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re in low, medium, or high mood,</p>
<p>no problem using that broad binning, right?</p>
<p>You could scale it on one to 10,</p>
<p>and then decide whether or not you&rsquo;re going to use</p>
<p>some dopamine elevating stimulus from the outside.</p>
<p>Again, it could be music,</p>
<p>could be exercise is an excellent way to elevate dopamine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about another well-established one</p>
<p>from the research literature</p>
<p>that is known to elevate dopamine by 65%</p>
<p>in the particular pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s relevant for divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and to do that without any pharmacology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share that with you in a moment,</p>
<p>but you need to decide for you in a given moment</p>
<p>or in a given work attempt at creativity,</p>
<p>what you need and apply accordingly,</p>
<p>because as Ciaramini and Hummel have shown,</p>
<p>whether or not you are in a low mood, medium mood,</p>
<p>or high mood really can determine whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to access divergent thinking or not.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re somebody who already has an idea in mind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very excited about a creative idea</p>
<p>and you want to hone it, you want to shape it,</p>
<p>you want to pressure test it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about what that means</p>
<p>in a three-step process in just a little bit.</p>
<p>I would strongly encourage you to look at that process</p>
<p>as a very linear process</p>
<p>in which there are right and wrong answers.</p>
<p>And there, the use of caffeine at appropriate dosages</p>
<p>and dosages for caffeine that are safe,</p>
<p>and in fact, performance enhancing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re covered in the episode on caffeine.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight, by the way.</p>
<p>And if you want to leverage caffeine</p>
<p>or maybe even other forms of healthy legal stimulants,</p>
<p>those are covered in the caffeine episode</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about a few more a little bit later.</p>
<p>So to summarize this segment</p>
<p>and also just to make a more general point,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very useful for people to start</p>
<p>to pay attention to what their tonic level,</p>
<p>that is their baseline level of dopamine,</p>
<p>ought to be in this nigrostriatal circuit</p>
<p>and in other circuits.</p>
<p>And to do that by learning to assess one&rsquo;s mood</p>
<p>and pay attention to what kind of mood</p>
<p>they happen to be in and then to leverage tools,</p>
<p>behavioral tools, maybe pharmacologic tools,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re safe and they&rsquo;re legal,</p>
<p>in order to either increase dopamine</p>
<p>or to elect not to increase dopamine</p>
<p>in order to access the creative process.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve mentioned pharmacology a few times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about that just a little bit more</p>
<p>in the context of dopamine.</p>
<p>First of all, there is no supplement or drug</p>
<p>that you or anyone else can take</p>
<p>that will selectively elevate dopamine</p>
<p>in only one of the four circuits that I described before.</p>
<p>Okay, this is just the state of the technology nowadays.</p>
<p>If you take a pill</p>
<p>or even if you were to inject some substance,</p>
<p>again, I hope this would be legal and safe, et cetera,</p>
<p>whatever mode of delivery,</p>
<p>there is no technology that exists at this time</p>
<p>that would allow you to selectively amplify dopamine,</p>
<p>for instance, just in the nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>or just in the mesocortical pathway.</p>
<p>Again, the nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>associated with divergent thinking,</p>
<p>the mesocortical pathway associated</p>
<p>with cognitive persistence and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>If you were to amplify dopamine levels,</p>
<p>for instance, by taking the amino acid precursor</p>
<p>to dopamine L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>something that I occasionally do</p>
<p>to enhance dopamine levels for sake of work or energy,</p>
<p>500 milligrams or 1,000 milligrams even of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll combine that with other things like alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to enhance dopamine transmission</p>
<p>in the nigrostriatal pathway,</p>
<p>the mesocortical pathway,</p>
<p>but also in the mesolimbic pathway,</p>
<p>and also for that matter,</p>
<p>in the tuberoinframedibular pathway</p>
<p>associated with the pituitary.</p>
<p>There is no way to direct dopamine activation</p>
<p>to just one of those pathways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a reflection of the existing technology.</p>
<p>Now, this is also true if you rely on illicit drugs</p>
<p>to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s cocaine or methamphetamine,</p>
<p>those will greatly increase dopamine,</p>
<p>but non-selectively across all those different pathways.</p>
<p>And likewise, with any drugs that inhibit or block</p>
<p>or antagonizes, it&rsquo;s called dopamine.</p>
<p>This is why people who, for instance,</p>
<p>have schizophrenia and take drugs</p>
<p>to suppress auditory hallucinations,</p>
<p>some of those drugs work</p>
<p>because they block the so-called D2 receptor</p>
<p>of the dopamine pathway.</p>
<p>D2 receptors are present in all four</p>
<p>of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, those drugs will in fact</p>
<p>suppress psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations,</p>
<p>et cetera, because they reduce dopamine,</p>
<p>but those people oftentimes</p>
<p>will have problems with movement.</p>
<p>They will express what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>in the clinical literature tardive dyskinesia,</p>
<p>kind of writhing of the face and the body</p>
<p>from suppression of dopamine</p>
<p>within the nigrostriatal pathway,</p>
<p>which is associated with movement.</p>
<p>They will sometimes have deficits in eye blinking.</p>
<p>People with Parkinson&rsquo;s who actually have selective deficits</p>
<p>of dopamine within the substantia nigra,</p>
<p>nigrostriatal, remember, substantia nigra,</p>
<p>show deficits in what?</p>
<p>In movement, in the smoothness of movement.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they won&rsquo;t blink at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have kind of a blank stare</p>
<p>and they have other issues as well.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in increasing dopamine through the use</p>
<p>of legal safe pharmacology,</p>
<p>as I would hope it would be the case,</p>
<p>there are ways to do that reasonably safely</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>Again, people with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or issues with the dopaminergic pathway should not do this.</p>
<p>I know nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of use</p>
<p>of drugs that increase dopamine,</p>
<p>such as Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, R-Modafinil,</p>
<p>often prescribed for things like</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on ADHD</p>
<p>and pharmacologic prescription supplement</p>
<p>and behavioral and nutritional tools for ADHD.</p>
<p>You can find that episode at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>I know a number of people take those compounds</p>
<p>in order to increase dopamine and focus</p>
<p>for sake of studying or other activities,</p>
<p>staying up long hours, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the fact that they increase focus,</p>
<p>although they do have their side effects,</p>
<p>sometimes severe, sometimes habit forming,</p>
<p>sometimes even addicting as well.</p>
<p>But the fact that they increase focus</p>
<p>should automatically tell you something,</p>
<p>that those drugs in particular increase dopamine</p>
<p>in the so-called mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways.</p>
<p>Why can I say that?</p>
<p>How can I say that with any degree of confidence?</p>
<p>Well, there are these four pathways,</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s involved in movement,</p>
<p>but these other ones are involved in motivation</p>
<p>and desire and reward.</p>
<p>And I told you that these things can be habit forming</p>
<p>and addicting in some cases,</p>
<p>and they can greatly increase focus.</p>
<p>And focus is supported by enhanced levels of dopamine</p>
<p>within this mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway.</p>
<p>So yes, those drugs increase dopamine across the board,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be some weighting of dopamine</p>
<p>toward the systems involved in motivation and reward,</p>
<p>and sometimes even leading to habit formation and addiction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why those drugs should only be taken</p>
<p>with the close supervision of a very skilled psychiatrist</p>
<p>or somebody else who&rsquo;s board certified</p>
<p>who can really govern that.</p>
<p>There are, however, ways to increase dopamine</p>
<p>more evenly across the board</p>
<p>using non-prescription approaches.</p>
<p>And one I already mentioned, which is L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>taken typically in dosages of 500 to 1,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is not as potent in increasing dopamine</p>
<p>as are the prescription drugs that I referred to before,</p>
<p>tends to be milder for some people,</p>
<p>it can have a very amplified effect,</p>
<p>they feel it right away,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very intense in elevating focus and motivation</p>
<p>and the desire to move.</p>
<p>For other people, it&rsquo;s less potent.</p>
<p>It really depends on a number of things.</p>
<p>I should mention that regular consumption of caffeine</p>
<p>of one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight per day</p>
<p>also will increase dopamine receptor efficacy and density,</p>
<p>which will make any existing dopamine more effective,</p>
<p>whether or not that dopamine is triggered</p>
<p>by things like L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not taking anything to elevate dopamine,</p>
<p>the dopamine that you do make will be more effective</p>
<p>in elevating your mood, motivation, and desire to move,</p>
<p>and by extension, divergent thinking,</p>
<p>if you are consuming caffeine.</p>
<p>But again, caffeine should be taken</p>
<p>prior to convergent thinking type tasks</p>
<p>probably more than it should be taken</p>
<p>prior to divergent thinking tasks.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other legal supplements</p>
<p>that can elevate dopamine as well.</p>
<p>In particular, phenylethylamine is very effective</p>
<p>in doing that, 600 milligrams of that,</p>
<p>has a brief effect lasting only about 30 to 45 minutes,</p>
<p>but it is one that many people find beneficial</p>
<p>for sake of studying or for creative thinking</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s pharmacology,</p>
<p>and in fact, there&rsquo;s an extensive landscape of prescription</p>
<p>and supplement-based pharmacology and indeed nutrition.</p>
<p>For instance, the consumption of foods</p>
<p>that are high in L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>such as aged Parmesan cheese, for instance, of all things,</p>
<p>very, very high in L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>Certain foods, you can look up online</p>
<p>which foods contain high levels of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>and which ones are compatible with your nutrition.</p>
<p>But leaving pharmacology aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very exciting non-pharmacological tool,</p>
<p>a purely behavioral tool,</p>
<p>that the research literature has told us</p>
<p>can selectively increase dopamine</p>
<p>within the nigrostriatal pathway,</p>
<p>the pathway that&rsquo;s involved in divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and can do so very dramatically,</p>
<p>as much as 65% above baseline.</p>
<p>And so this is a behavioral tool</p>
<p>that is useful for a number of things,</p>
<p>but that I find particularly interesting</p>
<p>in leveraging towards the exploration</p>
<p>and enhancement of creativity,</p>
<p>because first of all, it&rsquo;s purely behavioral,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s zero cost,</p>
<p>and it involves no manipulation of brain neuromodulators</p>
<p>or chemistry through pharmacology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that you can explore very safely</p>
<p>and certainly not having to purchase anything.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really remarkable is the selectivity,</p>
<p>or I think it&rsquo;s fair to say the immense selectivity</p>
<p>that this particular behavioral intervention</p>
<p>seems to exert on dopamine within this pathway</p>
<p>associated with divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So the study that I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>is a study that dates back 20 years.</p>
<p>Now that should not concern you.</p>
<p>In fact, the early arrival of this study,</p>
<p>or what now seems to be early arrival,</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago,</p>
<p>is really exciting because the first line of this study</p>
<p>really illustrates how important</p>
<p>or how much of a landmark study this really is.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll just read you the first line of the study,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll tell you the title,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll tell you what they discovered</p>
<p>in fairly top contour,</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to the study</p>
<p>if you want to peruse it in more detail.</p>
<p>The first line of the study is,</p>
<p>this is the first in vivo, just meaning in the organism.</p>
<p>In this case, this was a study on humans.</p>
<p>This is the first in vivo demonstration</p>
<p>of an association between</p>
<p>an endogenous neurotransmitter release,</p>
<p>endogenous means within us, and conscious experience.</p>
<p>So what this sentence essentially says</p>
<p>is this is the first study exploring</p>
<p>how a chemical that&rsquo;s naturally released in our body</p>
<p>relates to a particular quality of conscious experience.</p>
<p>This study was performed in Scandinavia</p>
<p>in one of the hospitals in Denmark.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link.</p>
<p>The first author is Kjer,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m pronouncing it correctly,</p>
<p>although probably not, K-J-A-E-R, et al.</p>
<p>And the title of the study is</p>
<p>Increased Dopamine Tone</p>
<p>During Meditation-Induced Change of Consciousness.</p>
<p>And I want to just highlight</p>
<p>that the meditation used in this study</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really a meditation at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they selected that for the title.</p>
<p>The behavioral protocol used in this study</p>
<p>was more akin to what is normally called yoga nidra,</p>
<p>or NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>Now, yoga nidra and NSDR have been discussed</p>
<p>many times before on this podcast.</p>
<p>Yoga nidra, for instance, is a practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years,</p>
<p>in which people deliberately lie still.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re forcing themselves to be mostly motionless.</p>
<p>Small movements are fine.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re directing their attention</p>
<p>to the surface of their body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing long exhale breathing,</p>
<p>sometimes some intentions, sometimes some visualization,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really self-directed relaxation.</p>
<p>And the key component is that people stay awake</p>
<p>and engage in very little movement.</p>
<p>And the keyword there is movement.</p>
<p>Now, non-sleep deep rest is an acronym,</p>
<p>a term that I coined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a term that I coined</p>
<p>in order to try and wipe away or discard with yoga nidra.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a person who has great respect</p>
<p>for yoga nidra and its traditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a term that I coined</p>
<p>in order to encompass a number of practices</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t include any mystical-type language</p>
<p>or scientific language, for that matter,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t involve intentions.</p>
<p>It involves deep relaxation,</p>
<p>yet remaining wide awake and conscious.</p>
<p>Sometimes people fall asleep and that&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>but this is really an atypical brain state</p>
<p>of being deeply relaxed, yet in general awake,</p>
<p>and motionless.</p>
<p>Again, motionless being the key.</p>
<p>Very few brain states involve us being mostly,</p>
<p>if not completely motionless, and yet awake.</p>
<p>And it turns out that brain state,</p>
<p>whether or not you call it yoga nidra,</p>
<p>you call it NSDR,</p>
<p>whether or not you call it meditation-induced</p>
<p>shift in consciousness as they did in this study,</p>
<p>although they do refer to yoga nidra,</p>
<p>all refer to the same thing,</p>
<p>which is being motionless and yet aware,</p>
<p>and relaxed, I should mention.</p>
<p>So in this study, what they did</p>
<p>was they brought subjects into the laboratory.</p>
<p>They had them either undergo</p>
<p>this self-directed deep relaxation</p>
<p>while they are motionless or mostly motionless,</p>
<p>or they had them listen to an audio script</p>
<p>while also just lying there with eyes closed.</p>
<p>And then they used a number of chemical tricks,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into those now</p>
<p>because they can be a little bit distracting.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested,</p>
<p>you can look at it in the study.</p>
<p>This is a binding of a chemical in the brain</p>
<p>that then they can image with brain imaging,</p>
<p>which is what they did in this study,</p>
<p>to evaluate how much dopamine changed in the brain</p>
<p>and where specifically in the brain</p>
<p>dopamine changed its levels before, during, and after</p>
<p>this particular behavioral practice</p>
<p>in one or the other group.</p>
<p>And what they discovered is that</p>
<p>people who did this deep relaxation,</p>
<p>that is self-directed deep relaxation,</p>
<p>lying there, eyes closed, relatively motionless,</p>
<p>although small movements of the body</p>
<p>or movements of the head are absolutely fine.</p>
<p>What they observed was a 65% increase in dopamine release.</p>
<p>Now here it&rsquo;s key, dopamine release.</p>
<p>And they observed an increase in so-called theta activity.</p>
<p>Theta activity is a pattern of brainwave activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s commonly associated with creative states</p>
<p>and divergent thinking in particular, so that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And they observed that across subjects,</p>
<p>specifically in the nigrostriatal pathway,</p>
<p>this pathway associated with divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So this is very exciting.</p>
<p>This is a study that really points to a behavioral tool</p>
<p>that can be used to selectively elevate dopamine</p>
<p>in the very pathway that one would want to</p>
<p>if they wanted to engage divergent thinking</p>
<p>for sake of creative exploration.</p>
<p>There are also a number of key observations</p>
<p>within this study.</p>
<p>First of all, the reduction in bodily movement</p>
<p>was essential.</p>
<p>In fact, when people rated</p>
<p>or when the amount of readiness for action in their system,</p>
<p>their body was evaluated,</p>
<p>what people found was that immediately after this practice,</p>
<p>they felt very still.</p>
<p>In other words, they felt as if remaining still was natural.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not the case that they couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>In fact, the elevation in dopamine that occurred</p>
<p>during this practice,</p>
<p>this yoga nidra-like non-sleep or NSDR-like practice</p>
<p>actually prepared them to be able to move</p>
<p>in a much more dedicated and robust way afterwards.</p>
<p>But during the practice,</p>
<p>their readiness for action went way, way down.</p>
<p>Not surprising, they were pretty much motionless.</p>
<p>But interestingly, as the level of readiness for movement</p>
<p>went down, down, down, down, down,</p>
<p>their degree of visual imagery,</p>
<p>that is their internal landscape</p>
<p>and their ability to imagine new things increased.</p>
<p>And in fact, areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with visual imagery,</p>
<p>such as the visual or so-called occipital cortex</p>
<p>and the parietal cortex has been shown in other studies</p>
<p>to ramp up when people are motionless.</p>
<p>So there seems to be this inverse relationship</p>
<p>between movement and visual imagery, which makes sense.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re moving,</p>
<p>we can pay attention to things in the outside world.</p>
<p>We tend to be aware of our sensory environment</p>
<p>to varying degrees,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t tend to be very focused on visual imagery</p>
<p>within our head.</p>
<p>Whereas when we lie down or sit down and close our eyes</p>
<p>and we are motionless,</p>
<p>the degree of visual imagery really increases.</p>
<p>Hence the increase in divergent thinking</p>
<p>because what essentially is happening</p>
<p>is the library of options,</p>
<p>the library of possible interactions</p>
<p>with whatever it is that you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>I give the example,</p>
<p>which is a trivial one on purpose of a pen,</p>
<p>but the bank of options that becomes available</p>
<p>when we are motionless</p>
<p>and when we are limiting our visualization</p>
<p>of the external world increases exponentially.</p>
<p>So this is important.</p>
<p>And what it points to is the fact</p>
<p>that this very simple,</p>
<p>completely non-pharmacologic behavioral practice</p>
<p>of lying down motionless for some period of time.</p>
<p>And I confess the amount of time</p>
<p>that they use in this study was quite long.</p>
<p>It was longer than 60 minutes,</p>
<p>but all the data that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>in terms of NSDR and Yoganidra,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a growing body of literature</p>
<p>on these practices I should mention,</p>
<p>show that even 10 minutes</p>
<p>or even better would be 20 or 30 minutes</p>
<p>of lying motionless with eyes closed</p>
<p>and allowing the mind to drift wherever it happens to go,</p>
<p>but focusing on relaxing by doing long exhale breathing,</p>
<p>perhaps doing a body scan</p>
<p>of focusing your attention on particular body parts,</p>
<p>but not keeping it focused</p>
<p>on any one particular body part for that long.</p>
<p>That general practice of deep relaxation while awake</p>
<p>and being relatively motionless</p>
<p>really favors the brain states</p>
<p>associated with divergent thinking</p>
<p>and actually represents an accessing</p>
<p>of the various components</p>
<p>that you would use during divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And perhaps most excitingly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s associated with this massive increase,</p>
<p>65% increase in dopamine release</p>
<p>within the very pathway that underlies divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So my recommendation would be for those of you</p>
<p>that are trying to enhance divergent thinking</p>
<p>and creative ability,</p>
<p>that you would do this practice at a minimum once per week.</p>
<p>And I should say, if you were going to do it once per week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend doing it for about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Some of you might be able to do it</p>
<p>for as long as 60 minutes.</p>
<p>I myself do such a practice on a daily basis,</p>
<p>anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example of an NSDR script,</p>
<p>completely zero cost.</p>
<p>I confess it does happen to be my voice,</p>
<p>so forgive me in advance.</p>
<p>There are other options of NSDR.</p>
<p>You can go to YouTube, put NSDR and my name.</p>
<p>Again, completely zero cost.</p>
<p>You can get a sample</p>
<p>of what a 10 minute NSDR script looks like.</p>
<p>Through Virtusan, put that out there.</p>
<p>So thank you, Virtusan,</p>
<p>for putting that out there at zero cost.</p>
<p>There are examples of 20 and 30 minute NSDR scripts</p>
<p>and yoga nidra scripts.</p>
<p>Some that I particularly like.</p>
<p>We will also provide a link to some of those.</p>
<p>Again, those are completely zero cost for you to explore.</p>
<p>But more important than you follow any one particular</p>
<p>yoga nidra NSDR script</p>
<p>is that you learn to take your body and brain</p>
<p>into these states of limited motion,</p>
<p>elevated dopamine within this particular pathway,</p>
<p>and fairly deep relaxation.</p>
<p>Again, if you happen to fall asleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>Although the idea is that you stay in a shallow plane</p>
<p>of consciousness or sleep,</p>
<p>hence the term non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>So in any event,</p>
<p>I think this is a very useful practice</p>
<p>that many people could benefit from.</p>
<p>And the fact that it&rsquo;s zero cost and purely behavioral,</p>
<p>I think adds additional benefit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s certainly one that people could explore</p>
<p>depending on what amount of time you&rsquo;re willing to commit.</p>
<p>And the research data on this</p>
<p>now extend beyond this one individual paper.</p>
<p>And I think is really exciting because what it says</p>
<p>is as the title and first line of the paper suggests</p>
<p>is that we can increase dopamine</p>
<p>using specific types of meditation induced consciousness.</p>
<p>And those increases in dopamine can be used</p>
<p>to increase our ability to be more creative.</p>
<p>Before moving forward,</p>
<p>I want to make absolutely clear</p>
<p>how it is that you would use NSDR,</p>
<p>AKA yoga nidra or similar.</p>
<p>The name doesn&rsquo;t really matter after all,</p>
<p>the practice is what matters</p>
<p>in order to enhance dopamine in this nigrostriatal pathway</p>
<p>and enhance divergent thinking.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand here</p>
<p>is that the period of motionlessness</p>
<p>and deep relaxation while awake</p>
<p>increases dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>It increases mental imagery.</p>
<p>That is, it increases access to the bank or the library,</p>
<p>if you will, of possible solutions</p>
<p>or elements to engage in the divergent thinking process.</p>
<p>But divergent thinking itself does not occur</p>
<p>during NSDR, AKA yoga nidra.</p>
<p>The NSDR and yoga nidra, deep relaxation, meditation,</p>
<p>whatever it is you want to call it,</p>
<p>sets a dopaminergic tone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the appropriate use of the word,</p>
<p>dopaminergic tone.</p>
<p>It raises the baseline of dopamine transmission</p>
<p>in that circuitry that then positions you</p>
<p>to engage in divergent thinking more effectively.</p>
<p>So the idea would be to do anywhere from 10 to 20,</p>
<p>maybe 30 minutes, maybe even as much as an hour,</p>
<p>depending on how much time you had to dedicate</p>
<p>of such a meditation NSDR practice.</p>
<p>And then, not necessarily immediately,</p>
<p>but within the five to 15 minutes following,</p>
<p>then to go into a practice of divergent thinking</p>
<p>and start doing creative exploration.</p>
<p>That is to start thinking about different ways</p>
<p>to combine existing elements in whatever domain it is</p>
<p>that you want to achieve creativity.</p>
<p>So the point is that the divergent thinking itself</p>
<p>is not occurring during the NSDR or yoga nidra practice.</p>
<p>The NSDR and yoga nidra practice</p>
<p>prepares you for divergent thinking</p>
<p>that you do in the hour or hours that follows.</p>
<p>And just to contrast that with pharmacology,</p>
<p>I am not aware of any specific dopamine-related pharmacology</p>
<p>that would allow us to selectively increase dopamine</p>
<p>in the very pathway associated</p>
<p>with divergent thinking and creativity.</p>
<p>Now, there are forms of pharmacology</p>
<p>that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators</p>
<p>in ways that favor creativity.</p>
<p>And this is certainly a topic</p>
<p>that we will go into in more depth in a future episode,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an exciting study</p>
<p>that was performed just this last year</p>
<p>looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator,</p>
<p>in divergent and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And it turns out that serotonin</p>
<p>underlies a lot of the brain activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for both divergent</p>
<p>and for convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one particular form of pharmacology</p>
<p>which can enhance activation</p>
<p>of the serotonergic pathways associated</p>
<p>with the so-called 5-HT, that&rsquo;s serotonin,</p>
<p>5-HT, that&rsquo;s the abbreviation, 5-HT2A receptor,</p>
<p>serotonin 2A receptor in particular brain areas</p>
<p>in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And the pharmacologic agent in that case</p>
<p>turns out to be very low dose,</p>
<p>or as some of you may have heard of it referred to</p>
<p>as microdosing of psilocybin.</p>
<p>Now I do want to say,</p>
<p>because it would be entirely inappropriate</p>
<p>for me to not say this,</p>
<p>that in most areas of the world,</p>
<p>and in particular in the United States,</p>
<p>psilocybin is still illegal.</p>
<p>It is not legal.</p>
<p>In some areas, it has been decriminalized.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different clinical trials</p>
<p>occurring now at Johns Hopkins, at Stanford,</p>
<p>at University of California, San Francisco,</p>
<p>and elsewhere exploring psilocybin</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression,</p>
<p>for trauma, for eating disorders.</p>
<p>Most of those studies focus on macro doses of psilocybin,</p>
<p>not microdosing.</p>
<p>There are far fewer studies of microdosing of psilocybin.</p>
<p>And I do have to point out that psilocybin use</p>
<p>and possession, and of course, sale is still illegal.</p>
<p>So I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t state that.</p>
<p>However, I will provide a link to the study</p>
<p>that shows that microdosing of psilocybin</p>
<p>for a series of weeks on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So these are dosages of psilocybin</p>
<p>that do not induce hallucination</p>
<p>and do not massively shift mood or internal states</p>
<p>in any way that has people feeling like they are acting</p>
<p>or feeling that much different,</p>
<p>although some people do report a subjective shift,</p>
<p>does seem to increase divergent thinking ability.</p>
<p>But I do want to put a big asterisk,</p>
<p>a highlight and an underlying pen</p>
<p>beneath the statement I&rsquo;m about to make,</p>
<p>which is that pharmacology of the serotonin system,</p>
<p>just as pharmacology of the dopamine system</p>
<p>is very broadband.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shotgun approach.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to hit all the circuits of the brain</p>
<p>that involve serotonin with microdosing psilocybin.</p>
<p>Although it has some selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor,</p>
<p>it can attach to other receptors as well and act there.</p>
<p>This is the same reason why SSRI,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>can indeed shift mood and appetite,</p>
<p>but it can also shift libido and other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there are serotonin receptors everywhere,</p>
<p>or I should say many places,</p>
<p>not just in the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with mood, for instance.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>agents, whether or not they are recreational</p>
<p>or illicit drugs or prescription drugs or supplements,</p>
<p>that increased dopamine will also be broadband</p>
<p>and hit a number of different circuits in parallel.</p>
<p>So this is why I always say</p>
<p>behavioral tools really should come first.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that because I dislike pharmacology.</p>
<p>I say that because in many cases,</p>
<p>behavioral tools are not only safer and easier to titrate,</p>
<p>to adjust the duration, et cetera, than is pharmacology,</p>
<p>but also because they can sometimes,</p>
<p>as in the case of the study we just described,</p>
<p>afford you more specificity, not less, than pharmacology.</p>
<p>Pharmacology has its place, can be wonderful,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s safe and legal, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it can cause a lot of so-called off-target effects.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in increasing creativity through pharmacology,</p>
<p>I would say stay tuned for the data</p>
<p>on psilocybin and microdosing psilocybin.</p>
<p>If you are absolutely obsessed with the idea</p>
<p>of microdosing psilocybin for enhancing creativity</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to go straight to the study,</p>
<p>I will tell you what that study is</p>
<p>and therefore you can access some of the specifics</p>
<p>in terms of dosaging and protocols, et cetera.</p>
<p>So since I can&rsquo;t help myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just very briefly summarize</p>
<p>that microdosing psychedelic study.</p>
<p>The title of the study, which was published in 2018,</p>
<p>is Exploring the Effect of Microdosing Psychedelics</p>
<p>on Creativity in an Open-Label Natural Setting.</p>
<p>Interesting title.</p>
<p>This was a microdosing event</p>
<p>organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society.</p>
<p>They examined the effects of psychedelic truffles</p>
<p>where they knew what sorts of psychedelic compounds</p>
<p>were contained there on two creativity-related</p>
<p>problem-solving tasks, the picture concept task,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t expect you to recognize or know,</p>
<p>but it assesses convergent thinking</p>
<p>and the alternative uses task,</p>
<p>which I also don&rsquo;t expect you to know,</p>
<p>but is a standard task for assessing divergent thinking.</p>
<p>They tested once before taking a microdose</p>
<p>and while the effects were expected to be manifested,</p>
<p>they say, oh, interesting.</p>
<p>They use the word manifested in a study of psychedelics.</p>
<p>Science is changing indeed.</p>
<p>In any case, what they found was an enhancement of creative,</p>
<p>that is divergent and convergent thinking,</p>
<p>not surprising given the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor</p>
<p>activity is increased by microdosing of psilocybin</p>
<p>and 5-HT2A receptors are present both on the neural circuits</p>
<p>that underlie divergent and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>So again, this is not a plug for microdosing psilocybin.</p>
<p>This is really in response to what I know</p>
<p>will be a number of different questions</p>
<p>about what sorts of pharmacologic agents</p>
<p>can be used to increase creativity.</p>
<p>So more on that later.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link</p>
<p>if you want to read that study in more depth.</p>
<p>I can imagine that a number of you</p>
<p>are probably also wondering about the effects of alcohol</p>
<p>and the effects of cannabis on creativity.</p>
<p>We did a long in-depth episode all about alcohol</p>
<p>and its effects on health.</p>
<p>The bottom line on alcohol</p>
<p>is that in excess of two drinks per week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to run into the cancer promoting</p>
<p>and toxic effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t choose for the answer to be that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what the data tell us.</p>
<p>Not telling you you can&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>more than two drinks per week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that if you&rsquo;re going to do that,</p>
<p>you should really consider offsetting that</p>
<p>with some other behavioral measures</p>
<p>all discussed in the episode on alcohol.</p>
<p>And despite what people think,</p>
<p>there is absolutely zero, zero evidence</p>
<p>that alcohol increases creativity.</p>
<p>However, by way of reducing activation</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>there is some evidence that alcohol and other substances</p>
<p>that reduce what it&rsquo;s called autobiographical scripting,</p>
<p>that is a narrative about ourselves,</p>
<p>sort of self-awareness,</p>
<p>that it can enhance divergent thinking</p>
<p>at very low doses.</p>
<p>And this makes sense.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking involves remembering certain things</p>
<p>that we can use as elements in the creative process,</p>
<p>but suppressing narratives</p>
<p>about what the use of those would mean.</p>
<p>Will people like it?</p>
<p>Will they not like it?</p>
<p>Will it lead to the outcome we want?</p>
<p>Will it won&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>All of that autobiographical scripting</p>
<p>involves the forebrain being very, very active</p>
<p>and specific regions of the forebrain in particular,</p>
<p>and that all needs to be suppressed,</p>
<p>which alcohol in very low doses can accomplish.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s not a plug for alcohol.</p>
<p>I think behavioral tools would be a much better route,</p>
<p>but it therefore shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising</p>
<p>why some people have used low-dose alcohol</p>
<p>in order to engage in the creative process</p>
<p>because it involves less inhibition or sense of self</p>
<p>that could be detrimental to the divergent thinking process.</p>
<p>Now, with respect to cannabis,</p>
<p>I went in depth into the biology</p>
<p>and the various uses, misuses, dangers,</p>
<p>and in some cases, benefits of cannabis use in certain,</p>
<p>the key word there is certain populations.</p>
<p>And I also dove into whether or not cannabis can be used</p>
<p>to increase divergent and convergent thinking.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s timestamped in that episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer you to that episode.</p>
<p>But the long and short of it is</p>
<p>that many of the ideas that people come up with</p>
<p>when under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>in particular high THC-containing cannabis,</p>
<p>does lead to enhanced divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but so enhanced, it turns out,</p>
<p>that oftentimes those ideas can&rsquo;t be constrained</p>
<p>by the convergent thinking process.</p>
<p>In other words, they have lots of ideas that make sense</p>
<p>while under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>but that later cannot be implemented</p>
<p>into a coherent framework that leads</p>
<p>to any actual creative endeavor or creative product.</p>
<p>Or as is often the case with cannabis,</p>
<p>they simply can&rsquo;t remember what they were thinking about.</p>
<p>Anytime there&rsquo;s a discussion about dopamine,</p>
<p>there seems to be a discussion about motivation,</p>
<p>desire, and drive.</p>
<p>And of course, that makes sense given the roles of dopamine.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of our most popular episodes.</p>
<p>Again, you can access that with timestamps</p>
<p>in all formats at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>And anytime there&rsquo;s a discussion</p>
<p>about dopamine and motivation,</p>
<p>we also seem to have a lot of questions</p>
<p>about attention and focus and ADHD</p>
<p>or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in particular.</p>
<p>So just as a brief mention, there is a literature,</p>
<p>although not terribly extensive,</p>
<p>a small but strong literature on the relationship</p>
<p>between ADHD and creativity.</p>
<p>And the long and short of that literature</p>
<p>is that people who have ADHD regardless of age</p>
<p>do seem to have an ability to focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned that in the episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>provided that they are interested</p>
<p>in the thing that they are focusing on.</p>
<p>So that runs counter to this idea</p>
<p>that people with ADHD simply can&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>They can, but it tends to be a focus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s selective for things</p>
<p>that they are very excited about or interested in</p>
<p>as opposed to a general ability to focus.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also highly underappreciated</p>
<p>is that people who have ADHD</p>
<p>oftentimes are very effective at divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but are less effective at convergent thinking.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that people with ADHD</p>
<p>can often have excellent novel and indeed creative ideas,</p>
<p>but that the implementation of those creative ideas</p>
<p>is sometimes challenged.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason to explore rational pharmacology,</p>
<p>nutrition, supplementation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those are all things to explore in concert with,</p>
<p>or I should say in working closely</p>
<p>with a board certified physician</p>
<p>or ideally psychiatrist expert in ADHD.</p>
<p>You can also check out the episode that we did on ADHD.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools there,</p>
<p>a lot of science mentioned there to support those tools.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>But I did think it was important to point out</p>
<p>even if briefly that having ADHD</p>
<p>is not a barrier to creativity.</p>
<p>In fact, may actually be an enhanced portal to creativity,</p>
<p>but that it doesn&rsquo;t allow people</p>
<p>to access the convergent thinking</p>
<p>that allows creative ideas to be implemented</p>
<p>into specific strategies, pressure tested,</p>
<p>and eventually delivered in the form</p>
<p>of a final product of music, art, et cetera.</p>
<p>That is not to say that people with ADHD</p>
<p>cannot accomplish that,</p>
<p>but that it is going to require some additional steps</p>
<p>and protocols in order to enhance convergent thinking.</p>
<p>And that episode and the episode that we did on focus</p>
<p>and in particular tools to enhance focus</p>
<p>is very much directed at ways</p>
<p>to enhance convergent thinking.</p>
<p>So if you have ADHD or know somebody who does</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in the creative process</p>
<p>or focusing generally,</p>
<p>please check out the episodes that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s also a small,</p>
<p>but nonetheless very exciting literature</p>
<p>on the relationship between physical movement</p>
<p>and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise to us.</p>
<p>As mentioned many times now in this episode,</p>
<p>the nigrostriatal pathway involved in divergent thinking</p>
<p>and it involves dopamine is also responsible for eye blinks</p>
<p>and for movements of the limbs of the body</p>
<p>in very deliberate ways.</p>
<p>This tells us that there&rsquo;s some direct</p>
<p>or maybe indirect relationship</p>
<p>between movement of the body and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And despite the fact that it&rsquo;s only a few studies,</p>
<p>there have been some studies of whether or not</p>
<p>people are able to engage in divergent thinking</p>
<p>more effectively when they are doing things</p>
<p>like pacing or walking.</p>
<p>And this could be on a treadmill</p>
<p>or back and forth across the room.</p>
<p>And in fact, that is absolutely the case.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody like myself</p>
<p>who tends to have their best ideas,</p>
<p>not saying that my ideas are always terrific,</p>
<p>but among the ideas I have,</p>
<p>some of the better ones arrive to me</p>
<p>while on my long Sunday run.</p>
<p>I tend to do a long run or hike on Sundays,</p>
<p>sometimes with a light weight vest</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m in a state of essentially</p>
<p>not directing my attention to any one thing</p>
<p>in my external environment,</p>
<p>this is extremely key for reasons</p>
<p>that now should be obvious.</p>
<p>Anytime we are directing our attention to a visual target</p>
<p>or an auditory target,</p>
<p>we are not as able to engage in divergent thinking.</p>
<p>This is why I will sometimes listen to podcasts</p>
<p>or to audio books while I go on these runs.</p>
<p>But for portions of these runs or hikes,</p>
<p>I tend to turn those off and just focus on the movement</p>
<p>and focus on not focusing on anything in particular.</p>
<p>And oftentimes I will stop and write down ideas</p>
<p>that suddenly or seemingly suddenly appear to me</p>
<p>or geyser to the surface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have an idea.</p>
<p>Sometimes those are good ideas, sometimes less good ideas.</p>
<p>The fact that that happens for me</p>
<p>and the fact that many people are pacers or runners</p>
<p>or come up with their best ideas while in the shower</p>
<p>or while engaging in activities</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require a lot of sensory attention</p>
<p>to one specific location,</p>
<p>either visual or auditory, et cetera,</p>
<p>that is because it engages these nigrostriatal pathways</p>
<p>through movement,</p>
<p>which then opens up this library of ideas</p>
<p>and allows the intersection of different ideas</p>
<p>that normally would be constrained to separate categories.</p>
<p>One way to think about this by analogy would be that,</p>
<p>you know, when I was a kid, you&rsquo;d go to the library</p>
<p>and nowadays you just go online,</p>
<p>but the different pages of different books</p>
<p>on different topics are kept distinct from one another.</p>
<p>That is bound by different book covers and book ends,</p>
<p>different shelves in the library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if different pages and elements from those books</p>
<p>are now being combined in a pseudo random,</p>
<p>not random, but in a pseudo random way.</p>
<p>And in that combination,</p>
<p>new possibilities about ways that information</p>
<p>could be combined and implemented start to arise.</p>
<p>So the tool that emerges from this is very simple</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t necessarily apply to everybody.</p>
<p>But if you are somebody who finds that</p>
<p>just sitting in a chair and trying to be creative</p>
<p>is very challenging,</p>
<p>some of you might benefit from, for instance,</p>
<p>if you are engaging in writing or you want to write,</p>
<p>to talk into the voice recorder of your phone while walking</p>
<p>or simply walking and not attending</p>
<p>to any one specific thing visually or through headphones.</p>
<p>And then as ideas surface, seemingly out of nowhere,</p>
<p>which is how it happens,</p>
<p>that you could either put them into your phone</p>
<p>by voice dictation, or you could type them out if you like.</p>
<p>The key thing is to not be distracted</p>
<p>by other things in your phone,</p>
<p>not to start going onto social media or doing phone calls</p>
<p>or looking at text messages,</p>
<p>because that by definition is going to take you out</p>
<p>of this, what biologists call a pseudo random walk.</p>
<p>And this pseudo random element is extremely important.</p>
<p>We know, for instance,</p>
<p>that many circuits within the brain</p>
<p>have what&rsquo;s called dedicated point-to-point wiring.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>the brain circuits that govern your breathing,</p>
<p>the brain circuits that govern your heartbeat,</p>
<p>the brain circuits that govern your specific movements</p>
<p>once you are an adult</p>
<p>and allow for smooth directed movement are very precise,</p>
<p>very little slop, if any, in the wiring.</p>
<p>However, there are aspects of your brain circuitry,</p>
<p>yours and everybody else&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I should say, that are maintained into adulthood</p>
<p>that include a lot of extra wiring.</p>
<p>And these are fine wires,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the major highways</p>
<p>between different areas, if you will.</p>
<p>So sort of like Google Maps has highways and streets</p>
<p>and little passages and alleys,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s a little web</p>
<p>of additional possible pathways</p>
<p>cast over that entire thing.</p>
<p>The human brain maintains such webs of possible passage,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only during activities</p>
<p>such as walking, running, cycling,</p>
<p>swimming, hiking, pacing, et cetera,</p>
<p>that the activation of those pseudo-random pathways</p>
<p>starts to ramp up.</p>
<p>So this is a purely behavioral approach</p>
<p>to engaging different elements within neural networks</p>
<p>that normally would not communicate with one another</p>
<p>when we are completely still.</p>
<p>So again, the practices I talked about earlier</p>
<p>of being completely still to raise dopamine</p>
<p>and enhance divergent thinking,</p>
<p>those, I just want to reemphasize,</p>
<p>are designed to position you,</p>
<p>to ready you to engage in the kinds of activities</p>
<p>like walking and pacing, et cetera,</p>
<p>that best facilitate divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody</p>
<p>who wants to enhance divergent thinking,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to explore</p>
<p>how different patterns of movement,</p>
<p>in particular patterns of movement</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require any conscious attention</p>
<p>to any one specific thing,</p>
<p>allow you to access new ideas</p>
<p>and new ways of combining existing elements</p>
<p>in whatever domain it is you want to be creative.</p>
<p>Now, this is also an opportunity</p>
<p>to underscore something I said back at the beginning,</p>
<p>which is you are not going to come up</p>
<p>with great works of music</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t understand chords and melodies</p>
<p>and notes and music.</p>
<p>Those basic elements have to be built up</p>
<p>through some sort of formal</p>
<p>or at least rigorous or regular training,</p>
<p>in the same way that you&rsquo;re not going to take a walk</p>
<p>and then suddenly be able to paint an incredible picture</p>
<p>if you have no painting ability.</p>
<p>That is not going to happen.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here</p>
<p>are ways to enhance your capacity for divergent thinking,</p>
<p>such as NSDR,</p>
<p>and ways to engage in divergent thinking,</p>
<p>such as through certain forms of movement</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require a lot of conscious attention</p>
<p>to your surroundings or any one specific sensory target.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>enhancing your ability to be more creative in a domain</p>
<p>for which you already have some degree of skill</p>
<p>or even mastery.</p>
<p>Now, in keeping with the theme</p>
<p>of how to enhance our creativity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very exciting and yet parallel literature</p>
<p>to the literature that I&rsquo;ve been describing thus far.</p>
<p>Now, I promise you that I&rsquo;m not going to open up</p>
<p>an entire library of new information</p>
<p>related to neural circuits and so forth,</p>
<p>but I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>this parallel literature</p>
<p>because it speaks very specifically</p>
<p>to some important practices</p>
<p>that we can all use in order to enhance creativity</p>
<p>and to do so the first time and every time.</p>
<p>And this is really because certain scientists out there</p>
<p>have really gone through the trouble,</p>
<p>I should even say the painstaking trouble</p>
<p>of really trying to dissect what the creative process is,</p>
<p>both for individuals and in groups or even in pairs.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>is beautifully encapsulated in an article</p>
<p>entitled, A New Method for Training Creativity,</p>
<p>Narrative as an Alternative to Divergent Thinking.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;ve been talking about divergent thinking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one pathway into the creative process,</p>
<p>but there are others as well.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, they&rsquo;re not so distinct</p>
<p>in terms of the underlying brain mechanisms.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, let me describe briefly</p>
<p>how narrative can be used to train creativity</p>
<p>and to become more creative.</p>
<p>And in order to do that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly paraphrase</p>
<p>or read from the first paragraph of this paper.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m about to read are the author&rsquo;s words, not mine.</p>
<p>Quote, here&rsquo;s a paradox.</p>
<p>According to current research,</p>
<p>young children are more imaginatively creative than adults.</p>
<p>And indeed that is true by the way.</p>
<p>Yet also according to current research,</p>
<p>creativity&rsquo;s main neural engine is divergent thinking,</p>
<p>which relies on memory and logical association,</p>
<p>two tasks at which young children underperform adults.</p>
<p>That is, children are not as good</p>
<p>at divergent thinking as adults are.</p>
<p>So how could it be, the authors are asking,</p>
<p>that children are more imaginative</p>
<p>and thus more creative than adults?</p>
<p>This can only mean</p>
<p>that there are alternate pathways to creativity.</p>
<p>And indeed that is the case.</p>
<p>And so what this paper really explores</p>
<p>is other ways to access creativity.</p>
<p>And what they describe is what&rsquo;s called narrative theory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a number of different aspects</p>
<p>to this narrative theory,</p>
<p>but they agree that the standard definition of creativity</p>
<p>is the same one that we were talking about before.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about a different form</p>
<p>of creativity here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a different way to access creativity.</p>
<p>They describe the standard definition of creativity</p>
<p>as quote, the ability to generate novel ideas</p>
<p>that are useful.</p>
<p>So the commonly accepted one.</p>
<p>And what they cite as the basis for narrative theory</p>
<p>is this breakthrough finding in the 1950s.</p>
<p>This is the work of Guilford.</p>
<p>Some people out there might be familiar with it.</p>
<p>I was not at the outset of researching this episode.</p>
<p>What this theory from Guilford essentially states</p>
<p>is that there are different intellectual capacities</p>
<p>that are not captured by standard IQ tests.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s generally accepted nowadays.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a standard IQ, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the important element to understand</p>
<p>is that these authors were able to trace back the idea</p>
<p>of narrative training as a way to enhance creativity</p>
<p>long before Guilford in the 1950s,</p>
<p>all the way back to Aristotle.</p>
<p>So this is incredible.</p>
<p>Narrative theory was actually birthed in 335 BCE</p>
<p>in his writing called Poetics,</p>
<p>which I think is incredible, at least to me,</p>
<p>that people long before us were thinking about creativity</p>
<p>and what goes into creativity.</p>
<p>And what Aristotle said, what Guilford then elaborated on</p>
<p>and what the authors of this paper further elaborate on</p>
<p>and actually have developed training protocols for</p>
<p>is the idea that there are three elements that we can use</p>
<p>in order to enhance creativity.</p>
<p>And those three elements are what&rsquo;s called world building.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what these are in a moment.</p>
<p>Perspective shifting and action generating.</p>
<p>And right off the bat,</p>
<p>the word action should raise a flag for you.</p>
<p>And by that, I mean a positive flag</p>
<p>because once again, we are back into the world</p>
<p>and therefore the neural circuits of movement and motion.</p>
<p>Okay, so three elements of world building,</p>
<p>perspective shifting and active generating</p>
<p>are what make up this narrative approach to creativity.</p>
<p>And I should mention that these authors and others</p>
<p>are using such approach with companies,</p>
<p>with groups, with individuals.</p>
<p>So this is using a bunch of different contexts</p>
<p>to approach and enhance different forms of creativity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk first about world building techniques.</p>
<p>This is going to be immediately familiar to you</p>
<p>when you hear it.</p>
<p>But one of the key elements of creativity</p>
<p>is to, at the outset, come up with some idea</p>
<p>that makes sense or is attractive to you</p>
<p>about how the world is different</p>
<p>inside of your creative endeavor.</p>
<p>So for those that write science fiction</p>
<p>or think about science fiction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some obvious aspects to this.</p>
<p>But for those of you that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe you come up with a narrative, for instance,</p>
<p>in the context of storytelling that in your world,</p>
<p>we are the house cats,</p>
<p>and the cats are actually the ones</p>
<p>that are the curators of the earth.</p>
<p>Okay, so right there, there is a conceptual shift</p>
<p>that the world in which whatever creative idea</p>
<p>is going to emerge is entirely different</p>
<p>than the one that we actually live in.</p>
<p>So that sets a certain number of important constraints.</p>
<p>It means certain things are now possible.</p>
<p>Other things are not possible</p>
<p>that are very different from the world that we live in.</p>
<p>You can see the parallels here</p>
<p>to kind of childhood imagination,</p>
<p>where essentially anything can happen in the child&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>because they are unconstrained.</p>
<p>The second element is this perspective shifting techniques.</p>
<p>And the idea here is that not only are we supposed</p>
<p>to have the reader or the listener or the observer or us</p>
<p>explore for creativity and develop a creative idea</p>
<p>by thinking differently, right?</p>
<p>Which is kind of a generic term.</p>
<p>How do we actually think differently?</p>
<p>But rather than just say,</p>
<p>take the perspective of somebody else</p>
<p>in terms of what they would see or do or say or think,</p>
<p>rather, we are supposed to think</p>
<p>about their underlying motivation.</p>
<p>So we could do the world shift.</p>
<p>That is the world structure shift from step one.</p>
<p>And then in step two, you would ask yourself,</p>
<p>okay, rather than write about or think about</p>
<p>or move from the perspective of myself,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re feeling particularly happy that day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, you know, I&rsquo;m actually going to take</p>
<p>the perspective of somebody who&rsquo;s angry,</p>
<p>but rather than just act angry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to think about what their motivation</p>
<p>for being angry is.</p>
<p>Maybe they had a breakup.</p>
<p>Maybe they were jealous.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody had wronged them in some way.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re just generally angry at the world</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and then operate from that motivational stance.</p>
<p>And this is a very interesting and powerful step</p>
<p>because what it really captures,</p>
<p>at least as viewed by me, the neuroscientist,</p>
<p>is it captures a whole set of neural circuits</p>
<p>about what that motivational state means</p>
<p>because motivational states dictate a huge number</p>
<p>of possible different outcomes,</p>
<p>but they really constrain the number</p>
<p>of different actions and outcomes</p>
<p>that any of us would engage in.</p>
<p>Rather than saying, I&rsquo;m going to view the world</p>
<p>the way that someone else would view the world,</p>
<p>by stating that we are going to be motivated</p>
<p>by their set of motivations and not our own,</p>
<p>it includes a lot more possibilities</p>
<p>and yet not an infinite number of possibilities.</p>
<p>They are constrained in a logical way,</p>
<p>which is one of the key elements of creativity.</p>
<p>And then this third element,</p>
<p>which is action generating techniques,</p>
<p>is a really cool one that you will immediately notice</p>
<p>for the workplace, which is forced collaboration.</p>
<p>So inside of this thing that we&rsquo;re building here,</p>
<p>this kind of story, you create a novel rule</p>
<p>for the world that your story is going to exist in,</p>
<p>or your music is going to exist in,</p>
<p>or your sport will exist in.</p>
<p>Then you create this perspective shift</p>
<p>where you take on the motivation</p>
<p>of someone else different than you.</p>
<p>And then you force collaboration between that person</p>
<p>who has this alternate motivation, different from you,</p>
<p>and someone else who has an entirely different motivation.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you create these kind of,</p>
<p>what are called the creative collisions.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re collisions because they&rsquo;re crossing one another</p>
<p>and something new has to emerge from them.</p>
<p>They could be antagonistic,</p>
<p>they could be arguments fighting physical</p>
<p>or verbal or otherwise, they could be synergistic.</p>
<p>They could take on any number of different forms,</p>
<p>depending on the motivations</p>
<p>and the individuals that are involved.</p>
<p>But even though I just described this in fairly top contour,</p>
<p>what I just described is actually the core elements</p>
<p>of any story or any creative endeavor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that many stories are from the perspective</p>
<p>of what we already know and believe</p>
<p>and think the world to be, and our own perspective,</p>
<p>and the actions that we would take</p>
<p>given that world and that perspective.</p>
<p>Whereas if we want to be creative,</p>
<p>we want to think outside of our usual framework</p>
<p>and yet using elements that exist within us, right?</p>
<p>No one has to tell us the creative narrative,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to come up with it on our own.</p>
<p>We want to essentially think in a childlike way,</p>
<p>how do children think?</p>
<p>Well, they have new different or entirely novel concepts</p>
<p>about how the world works, but those are bounded.</p>
<p>And this is a key word, those are bounded.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not infinite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that anything can happen, right?</p>
<p>Some kids will say we can fly</p>
<p>and you can shoot lasers out of your eyes.</p>
<p>You can do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s unicorns, a candy falling from the sky.</p>
<p>At some point, if you don&rsquo;t bound the change in the world,</p>
<p>it just becomes pure chaos.</p>
<p>And even children don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So we need to bound the change</p>
<p>and yet create some alternate universe, if you will,</p>
<p>in which the story takes place or the creation of any kind,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be a story takes place.</p>
<p>Then there has to be a perspective shift.</p>
<p>And this is very useful.</p>
<p>This is actually a tool that we can all use</p>
<p>of trying to take the perspective of others,</p>
<p>but not just asking what they would feel or think or do,</p>
<p>but ask what is their motivation in life generally?</p>
<p>Or what kind of mood stance or goal stance are they taking?</p>
<p>Are they trying to extract from others?</p>
<p>Are they trying to give to others?</p>
<p>Are they very altruistic, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then you take that individual</p>
<p>and you do that also for another individual</p>
<p>or group of individuals.</p>
<p>And you start thinking about how those different individuals</p>
<p>because of their different motivational states</p>
<p>would engage at the level of action, what they would do,</p>
<p>what they would say, would they mate, would they fight,</p>
<p>would they, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>You think of any story, the story of Star Wars,</p>
<p>the Greek myths, you think of any story</p>
<p>that has been created,</p>
<p>which we consider great and novel works.</p>
<p>And you start to find these three elements,</p>
<p>world-building, perspective-shifting</p>
<p>and action-generating techniques.</p>
<p>And so, while this is again,</p>
<p>just a broad contour of what this narrative approach</p>
<p>involves, I think it&rsquo;s a very important</p>
<p>and very exciting one because it gives us a formula, right?</p>
<p>We already know that divergent thinking</p>
<p>and convergent thinking are both elements</p>
<p>to the creative process.</p>
<p>This is suggesting that whether or not it involves</p>
<p>divergent thinking or not,</p>
<p>and these authors seem to think this is distinct</p>
<p>from divergent thinking,</p>
<p>that capturing some of the elements of creativity</p>
<p>that are present in childhood,</p>
<p>but that then tend to disappear</p>
<p>as we start to assume identity, build identity</p>
<p>and understand rules about the actual world we live in,</p>
<p>all of those basic elements of early childhood creativity</p>
<p>can be reawakened.</p>
<p>And in fact, they have data to support the fact</p>
<p>that they can be reawakened in adults in meaningful ways</p>
<p>that can lead to new product design,</p>
<p>new workplace interactions and on and on.</p>
<p>That I find very exciting.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, I do intend to do an entire episode</p>
<p>at some point on narrative and storytelling</p>
<p>and the role of narrative and storytelling,</p>
<p>not just for sake of creativity,</p>
<p>but also for accessing neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and for enhancing memory and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entire landscape of literature</p>
<p>and exciting tools and things to understand there.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, we will provide a link to this paper.</p>
<p>And for those of you that choose not to access the paper,</p>
<p>simply understanding these three aspects of narrative</p>
<p>as an alternative to accessing creativity,</p>
<p>that is a dedicated and well understood</p>
<p>or established world shift that you choose,</p>
<p>perspective shifting and taking on the motivation of others</p>
<p>and creating some sort of landscape of exploration</p>
<p>for what sorts of interactions would occur</p>
<p>between that individual or groups of individuals</p>
<p>and other individuals that have other motivations</p>
<p>and yet are still living in this alternate world.</p>
<p>Those three elements we now know can be combined</p>
<p>into what you or I or anyone</p>
<p>would consider important creative works.</p>
<p>So today we discussed creativity,</p>
<p>this absolutely fascinating aspect to human brain function</p>
<p>that has allowed us as a species to develop everything</p>
<p>from great works of art and music</p>
<p>to technological innovations that allow us to fly</p>
<p>and allow us to access people all over the world</p>
<p>through little screen devices</p>
<p>that we carry around in our pockets and on and on.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I find creativity to be one of the most fascinating aspects</p>
<p>of brain function and in particular,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>what the upper limits of creativity are</p>
<p>and yet we understand that there are certain bounds,</p>
<p>there are certain requirements</p>
<p>and the key requirement for creativity</p>
<p>is this aspect of utility.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that for something to be considered creative,</p>
<p>it has to be useful in the practical sense,</p>
<p>but it does seem that for something</p>
<p>to be considered truly creative</p>
<p>or especially creative in some cases,</p>
<p>that it revealed to us something fundamental</p>
<p>about the way that we or the world works.</p>
<p>We discussed some of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that underlie the different aspects of creativity</p>
<p>in particular divergent and convergent thinking</p>
<p>as well as narrative building</p>
<p>and some of the tools and steps</p>
<p>that can allow us to better access</p>
<p>divergent thinking and convergent thinking</p>
<p>and those tools include behavioral tools</p>
<p>as well as pharmacology</p>
<p>and we talked about narrative building</p>
<p>as a way to reawaken or I should say,</p>
<p>reaccess the childhood creativity</p>
<p>that did indeed exist in all of us at some point in time.</p>
