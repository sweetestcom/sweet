    <p>The following is a conversation with Kai Fu Lee.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chairman and CEO of Cinovation Ventures</p>
<p>that manages a $2 billion dual currency investment fund</p>
<p>with a focus on developing the next generation</p>
<p>of Chinese high tech companies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the former president of Google China</p>
<p>and the founder of what is now called</p>
<p>Microsoft Research Asia,</p>
<p>an institute that trained many of the artificial</p>
<p>intelligence leaders in China,</p>
<p>including CTOs or AI execs at Baidu,</p>
<p>Tencent, Alibaba, Lenovo, and Huawei.</p>
<p>He was named one of the 100 most influential people</p>
<p>in the world by Time Magazine.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of seven bestselling books in Chinese</p>
<p>and most recently, the New York Times bestseller</p>
<p>called AI Superpowers, China, Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>and the New World Order.</p>
<p>He has unparalleled experience</p>
<p>in working across major tech companies</p>
<p>and governments and applications of AI,</p>
<p>and so he has a unique perspective on global innovation</p>
<p>and the future of AI that I think is important</p>
<p>to listen to and think about.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kaifu Li.</p>
<p>I immigrated from Russia to US when I was 13.</p>
<p>You immigrated to US at about the same age.</p>
<p>The Russian people, the American people,</p>
<p>the Chinese people each have a certain soul,</p>
<p>a spirit that permeates throughout the generations.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit of a poetic question,</p>
<p>but could you describe your sense</p>
<p>of what defines the Chinese soul?</p>
<p>I think the Chinese soul of people today, right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about people who have had centuries of burden</p>
<p>because of the poverty that the country has gone through,</p>
<p>and suddenly shined with hope of prosperity</p>
<p>in the past 40 years as China opened up</p>
<p>and embraced market economy.</p>
<p>And undoubtedly, there are two sets of pressures</p>
<p>on the people, that of the tradition,</p>
<p>that of facing difficult situations,</p>
<p>and that of hope of wanting to be the first</p>
<p>to become successful and wealthy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very strong hunger and a strong desire</p>
<p>and strong work ethic that drives China forward.</p>
<p>And is there roots to not just this generation,</p>
<p>but before that&rsquo;s deeper</p>
<p>than just the new economic developments?</p>
<p>Is there something that&rsquo;s unique to China</p>
<p>that you could speak to that&rsquo;s in the people?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the Chinese tradition</p>
<p>is about excellence, dedication, and results.</p>
<p>And the Chinese exams and study subjects in schools</p>
<p>have traditionally started</p>
<p>from memorizing 10,000 characters,</p>
<p>not an easy task to start with.</p>
<p>And further by memorizing</p>
<p>his historic philosopher&rsquo;s literature poetry.</p>
<p>So it really is probably</p>
<p>the strongest rote learning mechanism created</p>
<p>to make sure people had good memory</p>
<p>and remember things extremely well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think at the same time,</p>
<p>suppresses the breakthrough innovation</p>
<p>and also enhances the speed execution get results.</p>
<p>And that I think characterizes</p>
<p>the historic basis of China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s echoes of that in Russian education</p>
<p>as well as rote memorization.</p>
<p>So you have to memorize a lot of poetry.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just an emphasis on perfection in all forms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not conducive to perhaps what you&rsquo;re speaking to,</p>
<p>which is creativity.</p>
<p>But you think that kind of education holds back</p>
<p>the innovative spirit that you might see</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>Well, it holds back the breakthrough innovative spirits</p>
<p>that we see in the United States,</p>
<p>but it does not hold back the valuable execution oriented,</p>
<p>result oriented value creating engines,</p>
<p>which we see China being very successful.</p>
<p>So is there a difference between a Chinese AI engineer today</p>
<p>and an American AI engineer,</p>
<p>perhaps rooted in the culture that we just talked about</p>
<p>or the education or the very soul of the people or no?</p>
<p>And what would your advice be to each</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a difference?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s similar</p>
<p>because AI is about mastering sciences,</p>
<p>about using known technologies and trying new things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also about picking from many parts</p>
<p>of possible networks to use</p>
<p>and different types of parameters to tune.</p>
<p>And that part is somewhat rote.</p>
<p>And it is also, as anyone who&rsquo;s built AI products</p>
<p>can tell you a lot about cleansing the data</p>
<p>because AI runs better with more data</p>
<p>and data is generally unstructured,</p>
<p>errorful and unclean.</p>
<p>And the effort to clean the data is immense.</p>
<p>So I think the better part of American engineering,</p>
<p>AI engineering process is to try new things,</p>
<p>to do things people haven&rsquo;t done before</p>
<p>and to use technology to solve most if not all problems.</p>
<p>So to make the algorithm work despite not so great data,</p>
<p>find error tolerant ways to deal with the data.</p>
<p>The Chinese way would be to basically enumerate</p>
<p>to the fullest extent all the possible ways</p>
<p>by a lot of machines, try lots of different ways</p>
<p>to get it to work and spend a lot of resources</p>
<p>and money and time cleaning up data.</p>
<p>That means the AI engineer may be writing</p>
<p>data cleansing algorithms, working with thousands of people</p>
<p>who label or correct or do things with the data.</p>
<p>That is the incredible hard work</p>
<p>that might lead to better results.</p>
<p>So the Chinese engineer would rely on</p>
<p>and ask for more and more and more data</p>
<p>and find ways to cleanse them and make them work</p>
<p>in the system and probably less time thinking</p>
<p>about new algorithms that can overcome data</p>
<p>or other issues.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>Where do you think the biggest impact</p>
<p>in the next 10 years lies?</p>
<p>Is it in some breakthrough algorithms</p>
<p>or is it in just this at scale rigor,</p>
<p>a rigorous approach to data, cleaning data,</p>
<p>organizing data onto the same algorithms?</p>
<p>What do you think the big impact in the applied world is?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re really in the company</p>
<p>and you have to deliver results,</p>
<p>using known techniques and enhancing data</p>
<p>seems like the more expedient approach</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very low risk and likely to generate</p>
<p>better and better results.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the Chinese approach has done quite well.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of more challenging startups</p>
<p>and problems such as autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>medical diagnosis that existing algorithms</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t solve.</p>
<p>And that would put the Chinese approach more challenged</p>
<p>and give them more breakthrough innovation approach,</p>
<p>more of an edge on those kinds of problems.</p>
<p>So let me talk to that a little more.</p>
<p>So my intuition personally is that data</p>
<p>can take us extremely far.</p>
<p>So you brought up autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>So your intuition is that huge amounts of data</p>
<p>might not be able to completely help us solve that problem.</p>
<p>Right, so breaking that down further in autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>I think huge amounts of data probably will solve</p>
<p>trucks driving on highways,</p>
<p>which will deliver a significant value</p>
<p>and China will probably lead in that.</p>
<p>And full L5 autonomous is likely to require</p>
<p>new technologies we don&rsquo;t yet know.</p>
<p>And that might require academia</p>
<p>and great industrial research,</p>
<p>both innovating and working together.</p>
<p>And in that case, US has an advantage.</p>
<p>So the interesting question there is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>on the autonomous vehicle space</p>
<p>and the developments with Tesla and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Where they are in fact full steam ahead</p>
<p>into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy, L5,</p>
<p>L4, L5, and they&rsquo;re trying to solve that purely with data.</p>
<p>So the same kind of thing that you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is just for highway,</p>
<p>which is what a lot of people share your intuition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to solve with data.</p>
<p>So just to linger on that moment further,</p>
<p>do you think possible for them to achieve success</p>
<p>with simply just a huge amount of this training</p>
<p>on edge cases and difficult cases in urban environments,</p>
<p>not just highway and so on?</p>
<p>I think it would be very hard.</p>
<p>One could characterize Tesla&rsquo;s approach</p>
<p>as kind of a Chinese strength approach, right?</p>
<p>Gather all the data you can</p>
<p>and hope that will overcome the problems.</p>
<p>But in autonomous driving,</p>
<p>clearly a lot of the decisions aren&rsquo;t merely solved</p>
<p>by aggregating data and having feedback loop.</p>
<p>There are things that are more akin to human thinking.</p>
<p>And how would those be integrated and built?</p>
<p>There has not yet been a lot of success</p>
<p>integrating human intelligence</p>
<p>or call it expert systems if you will,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s a taboo word with the machine learning.</p>
<p>And the integration of the two types of thinking</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t yet been demonstrated.</p>
<p>And the question is how much can you push</p>
<p>a purely machine learning approach?</p>
<p>And of course, Tesla also has an additional constraint</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have all the sensors.</p>
<p>I know that they think it&rsquo;s foolish to use LIDARs,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s clearly a one less very valuable</p>
<p>and reliable source of input that they&rsquo;re foregoing,</p>
<p>which may also have consequences.</p>
<p>I think the advantage of course is capturing data</p>
<p>that no one has ever seen before.</p>
<p>And in some cases such as computer vision</p>
<p>and speech recognition,</p>
<p>I have seen Chinese companies accumulate data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not seen anywhere in the Western world</p>
<p>and they have delivered superior results.</p>
<p>But then speech recognition and object recognition</p>
<p>are relatively suitable problems for deep learning</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have the potentially need</p>
<p>for the human intelligence analytical planning elements.</p>
<p>And the same on the speech recognition side,</p>
<p>your intuition that speech recognition</p>
<p>and the machine learning approaches to speech recognition</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t take us to a conversational system</p>
<p>that can pass the Turing test,</p>
<p>which is sort of maybe akin to what driving is.</p>
<p>So it needs to have something more than just simply</p>
<p>simple language understanding, simple language generation.</p>
<p>Roughly right.</p>
<p>I would say that based on purely machine learning approaches,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to imagine it could lead</p>
<p>to a full conversational experience</p>
<p>across arbitrary domains, which is akin to L5.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little hesitant to use the word Turing test</p>
<p>because the original definition was probably too easy.</p>
<p>We probably do that, yeah.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Turing test</p>
<p>is what I was referring to. Of course.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve had major leadership research positions</p>
<p>at Apple, Microsoft, Google.</p>
<p>So continuing on the discussion of America, Russia,</p>
<p>Chinese, Seoul and culture and so on.</p>
<p>What is the culture of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>in contrast to China and maybe US broadly?</p>
<p>And what is the unique culture</p>
<p>of each of these three major companies in your view?</p>
<p>I think in aggregate, Silicon Valley companies,</p>
<p>and we could probably include Microsoft in that,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not in the Valley,</p>
<p>is really dream big and have visionary goals</p>
<p>and believe that technology will conquer all.</p>
<p>And also the self confidence and the self entitlement</p>
<p>that whatever they produce,</p>
<p>the whole world should use and must use.</p>
<p>And those are historically important, I think.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs famous quote that he doesn&rsquo;t do focus groups,</p>
<p>he looks in the mirror and asks the person in the mirror,</p>
<p>what do you want?</p>
<p>And that really is an inspirational comment that says,</p>
<p>the great company shouldn&rsquo;t just ask users what they want,</p>
<p>but develop something that users will know they want</p>
<p>when they see it,</p>
<p>but they could never come up with themselves.</p>
<p>I think that is probably the most exhilarating description</p>
<p>of what the essence of Silicon Valley is,</p>
<p>that this brilliant idea could cause you to build something</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t come out of the focus groups or AB tests.</p>
<p>And iPhone would be an example of that.</p>
<p>No one in the age of Blackberry would write down</p>
<p>they want an iPhone or multi touch.</p>
<p>A browser might be another example.</p>
<p>No one would say they want that in the days of FTP,</p>
<p>but once they see it, they want it.</p>
<p>So I think that is what Silicon Valley is best at.</p>
<p>But it also comes with, it came with a lot of success.</p>
<p>These products became global platforms</p>
<p>and there were basically no competitors anywhere.</p>
<p>And that has also led to a belief</p>
<p>that these are the only things that one should do,</p>
<p>that companies should not tread on other companies territory</p>
<p>so that a Groupon and a Yelp and then OpenTable</p>
<p>and the Grubhub would each feel,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m not gonna do the other company&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>because that would not be the pride of innovating</p>
<p>what each of these four companies have innovated.</p>
<p>But I think the Chinese approach</p>
<p>is do whatever it takes to win.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a winner take all market.</p>
<p>And in fact, in the internet space,</p>
<p>the market leader will get predominantly all the value</p>
<p>extracted out of the system.</p>
<p>So, and the system isn&rsquo;t just defined</p>
<p>as one narrow category, but gets broader and broader.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s amazing ambition for success and domination</p>
<p>of increasingly larger product categories</p>
<p>leading to clear market winner status</p>
<p>and the opportunity to extract tremendous value.</p>
<p>And that develops a practical, result oriented,</p>
<p>ultra ambitious winner take all gladiatorial mentality.</p>
<p>And if what it takes is to build what the competitors built,</p>
<p>essentially a copycat that can be done</p>
<p>without infringing laws.</p>
<p>If what it takes is to satisfy a foreign country&rsquo;s need</p>
<p>by forking the code base and building something</p>
<p>that looks really ugly and different, they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s contrasted very sharply</p>
<p>with the Silicon Valley approach.</p>
<p>And I think the flexibility and the speed and execution</p>
<p>has helped the Chinese approach.</p>
<p>And I think the Silicon Valley approach</p>
<p>is potentially challenged if every Chinese entrepreneur</p>
<p>is learning from the whole world, US and China,</p>
<p>and the American entrepreneurs only look internally</p>
<p>and write off China as a copycat.</p>
<p>And the second part of your question</p>
<p>about the three companies.</p>
<p>The unique elements of the three companies perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Apple represents</p>
<p>while the user please the user</p>
<p>and the essence of design and brand</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the one company and perhaps the only tech company</p>
<p>that draws people with a strong, serious desire</p>
<p>for the product and the willingness to pay a premium</p>
<p>because of the halo effect of the brand</p>
<p>which came from the attention to detail</p>
<p>and great respect for user needs.</p>
<p>Microsoft represents a platform approach</p>
<p>that builds giant products that become very strong modes</p>
<p>that others can&rsquo;t do because it&rsquo;s well architected</p>
<p>at the bottom level and the work is efficiently delegated</p>
<p>to individuals and then the whole product is built</p>
<p>by adding small parts that sum together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably the most effective high tech assembly line</p>
<p>that builds a very difficult product</p>
<p>that and the whole process of doing that</p>
<p>is kind of a differentiation and something competitors</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t easily repeat.</p>
<p>Are there elements of the Chinese approach</p>
<p>in the way Microsoft went about assembling</p>
<p>those little pieces and dominating,</p>
<p>essentially dominating the market for a long time</p>
<p>or do you see those as distinct?</p>
<p>I think there are elements that are the same.</p>
<p>I think the three American companies that had</p>
<p>or have Chinese characteristics and obviously</p>
<p>as well as American characteristics are Microsoft,</p>
<p>Facebook and Amazon.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, Amazon.</p>
<p>Because these are companies that will tenaciously</p>
<p>go after adjacent markets,</p>
<p>build up strong product offering and find ways</p>
<p>to extract greater value from a sphere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever increasing and they understand</p>
<p>the value of the platforms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the similarity and then with Google,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a genuinely value oriented company</p>
<p>that does have a heart and soul</p>
<p>and that wants to do great things for the world</p>
<p>by connecting information</p>
<p>and that has also very strong technology genes</p>
<p>and wants to use technology</p>
<p>and has found out of the box ways to use technology</p>
<p>to deliver incredible value to the end user.</p>
<p>If you can look at Google, for example,</p>
<p>you mentioned heart and soul.</p>
<p>There seems to be an element where Google</p>
<p>is after making the world better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a more positive view.</p>
<p>They used to have the slogan, don&rsquo;t be evil.</p>
<p>And Facebook a little bit more has a negative tend to it.</p>
<p>At least in the perception of privacy and so on.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of how these different companies</p>
<p>can achieve, because you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>how much we can make the world better</p>
<p>in all these kinds of ways with AI.</p>
<p>What is it about a company that can make,</p>
<p>give it a heart and soul, gain the trust of the public</p>
<p>and just actually just not be evil</p>
<p>and do good for the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard and I think Google</p>
<p>has struggled with that.</p>
<p>First, the don&rsquo;t do evil mantra is very dangerous</p>
<p>because every employee&rsquo;s definition of evil is different.</p>
<p>And that has led to some difficult</p>
<p>employee situations for them.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that&rsquo;s a good value statement,</p>
<p>but just watching the kinds of things Google</p>
<p>or its parent company Alphabet does</p>
<p>in new areas like healthcare, like eradicating mosquitoes,</p>
<p>things that are really not in the business</p>
<p>of a internet tech company.</p>
<p>I think that shows that there&rsquo;s a heart and soul</p>
<p>and desire to do good and willingness</p>
<p>to put in the resources to do something</p>
<p>when they see it&rsquo;s good, they will pursue it.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>it has all the trust of the users.</p>
<p>I realize while most people would view Facebook</p>
<p>as the primary target of their recent unhappiness</p>
<p>about Silicon Valley companies,</p>
<p>many would put Google in that category.</p>
<p>And some have named Google&rsquo;s business practices</p>
<p>as predatory also.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of difficult to have the two parts of a body.</p>
<p>The brain wants to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do</p>
<p>for a shareholder, maximize profit.</p>
<p>And then the heart and soul wants to do good things</p>
<p>that may run against what the brain wants to do.</p>
<p>So in this complex balancing</p>
<p>that these companies have to do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned that you&rsquo;re concerned</p>
<p>about a future where too few companies</p>
<p>like Google, Facebook, Amazon are controlling our data</p>
<p>or controlling too much of our digital lives.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on this concern</p>
<p>and perhaps do you have a better way forward?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m hardly the most vocal complainer of this.</p>
<p>Sure, of course.</p>
<p>There are a lot louder complainers out there.</p>
<p>I do observe that having a lot of data</p>
<p>does perpetuate their strength</p>
<p>and limits competition in many spaces.</p>
<p>But I also believe AI is much broader</p>
<p>than the internet space.</p>
<p>So the entrepreneurial opportunities still exists</p>
<p>in using AI to empower financial,</p>
<p>retail, manufacturing, education applications.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite a case</p>
<p>of full monopolistic dominance</p>
<p>that totally stifles innovation.</p>
<p>But I do believe in their areas of strength</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to dislodge them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have a good solution.</p>
<p>Probably the best solution is let</p>
<p>the entrepreneurial VC ecosystem work well</p>
<p>and find all the places that can create the next Google,</p>
<p>the next Facebook.</p>
<p>So there will always be increasing number of challengers.</p>
<p>In some sense that has happened a little bit.</p>
<p>You see Uber, Airbnb having emerged</p>
<p>despite the strength of the big three.</p>
<p>And I think China as an environment</p>
<p>may be more interesting for the emergence</p>
<p>because if you look at companies</p>
<p>between let&rsquo;s say 50 to $300 billion,</p>
<p>China has emerged more of such companies</p>
<p>than the US in the last three to four years</p>
<p>because of the larger marketplace,</p>
<p>because of the more fearless nature of the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And the Chinese giants are just as powerful</p>
<p>as American ones.</p>
<p>Tencent, Alibaba are very strong,</p>
<p>but ByteDance has emerged worth 75 billion</p>
<p>and financial while it&rsquo;s Alibaba affiliated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nevertheless independent and worth 150 billion.</p>
<p>And so I do think if we start to extend</p>
<p>to traditional businesses,</p>
<p>we will see very valuable companies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably not the case that in five or 10 years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still see the whole world</p>
<p>with these five companies having such dominance.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned a couple of times</p>
<p>this fascinating world of entrepreneurship in China</p>
<p>of the fearless nature of the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>So can you maybe talk a little bit about</p>
<p>what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China?</p>
<p>What are the strategies that are undertaken?</p>
<p>What are the ways to achieve success?</p>
<p>What is the dynamic of VCF funding</p>
<p>of the way the government helps companies and so on?</p>
<p>What are the interesting aspects here</p>
<p>that are distinct from, that are different</p>
<p>from the Silicon Valley world of entrepreneurship?</p>
<p>Well, many of the listeners probably still</p>
<p>would brand Chinese entrepreneur as copycats.</p>
<p>And no doubt 10 years ago,</p>
<p>that would not be an inaccurate description.</p>
<p>Back 10 years ago,</p>
<p>an entrepreneur probably could not get funding</p>
<p>if he or she could not describe</p>
<p>what product he or she is copying from the US.</p>
<p>The first question is who has proven this business model</p>
<p>which is a nice way of asking who are you copying?</p>
<p>And that reason is understandable</p>
<p>because China had a much lower internet penetration</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have enough indigenous experience</p>
<p>to build innovative products.</p>
<p>And secondly, internet was emerging.</p>
<p>Link startup was the way to do things,</p>
<p>building a first minimally viable product</p>
<p>and then expanding was the right way to go.</p>
<p>And the American successes have given a shortcut</p>
<p>that if you built your minimally viable product</p>
<p>based on an American product,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guaranteed to be a decent starting point.</p>
<p>Then you tweak it afterwards.</p>
<p>So as long as there are no IP infringement,</p>
<p>which as far as I know there hasn&rsquo;t been in the mobile</p>
<p>and AI spaces, that&rsquo;s a much better shortcut.</p>
<p>And I think Silicon Valley would view that</p>
<p>as still not very honorable</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not your own idea to start with,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really at the same time</p>
<p>believe every idea must be your own</p>
<p>and believe in the link startup methodology</p>
<p>because link startup is intended to try many, many things</p>
<p>and then converge when that works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s meant to be iterated and changed.</p>
<p>So finding a decent starting point</p>
<p>without legal violations,</p>
<p>there should be nothing morally dishonorable about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just a quick pause on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>why is that not honorable, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly as you formulated.</p>
<p>It seems like a perfect start for business.</p>
<p>Is to take, look at Amazon and say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;ll do exactly what Amazon is doing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there in this particular market</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s out innovate them from that starting point.</p>
<p>Come up with new ways.</p>
<p>I mean, is it wrong to be,</p>
<p>except the word copycat just sounds bad,</p>
<p>but is it wrong to be a copycat?</p>
<p>It just seems like a smart strategy,</p>
<p>but yes, it doesn&rsquo;t have a heroic nature to it</p>
<p>that like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>sort of in something completely,</p>
<p>coming up with something completely new.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like the way you describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nonheroic, acceptable way to start the company</p>
<p>and maybe more expedient.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, a baggage for Silicon Valley</p>
<p>that if it doesn&rsquo;t let go,</p>
<p>then it may limit the ultimate ceiling of the company.</p>
<p>Take Snapchat as an example.</p>
<p>I think, you know, Evan&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>He built a great product,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very proud that he wants to build his own features,</p>
<p>not copy others.</p>
<p>While Facebook was more willing to copy his features</p>
<p>and you see what happens in the competition.</p>
<p>So I think putting that handcuff on the company</p>
<p>would limit its ability to reach the maximum potential.</p>
<p>So back to the Chinese environment,</p>
<p>copying was merely a way to learn from the American masters.</p>
<p>Just like we, if we learned to play piano or painting,</p>
<p>you start by copying.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t start by innovating</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have the basic skill sets.</p>
<p>So very amazingly, the Chinese entrepreneurs</p>
<p>about six years ago started to branch off</p>
<p>with these lean startups built on American ideas</p>
<p>to build better products than American products.</p>
<p>But they did start from the American idea.</p>
<p>And today WeChat is better than WhatsApp,</p>
<p>Weibo is better than Twitter,</p>
<p>Zhihu is better than Quora and so on.</p>
<p>So that I think is Chinese entrepreneurs going to step two.</p>
<p>And then step three is once these entrepreneurs</p>
<p>have done one or two of these companies,</p>
<p>they now look at the Chinese market and the opportunities</p>
<p>and come up with ideas that didn&rsquo;t exist elsewhere.</p>
<p>So products like Ant Financial,</p>
<p>under which includes Alipay, which is mobile payments,</p>
<p>and also the financial products for loans built on that.</p>
<p>And also in education, VIPKID,</p>
<p>and in social video, social network, TikTok,</p>
<p>and in social eCommerce, Pinduoduo,</p>
<p>and then in ride sharing, Mobike,</p>
<p>these are all Chinese innovated products</p>
<p>that now are being copied elsewhere.</p>
<p>So an additional interesting observation</p>
<p>is some of these products</p>
<p>are built on unique Chinese demographics,</p>
<p>which may not work in the US,</p>
<p>but may work very well in Southeast Asia, Africa,</p>
<p>and other developing worlds</p>
<p>that are a few years behind China.</p>
<p>And a few of these products maybe are universal</p>
<p>and are getting traction even in the United States,</p>
<p>such as TikTok.</p>
<p>So this whole ecosystem is supported by VCs</p>
<p>as a virtuous cycle,</p>
<p>because a large market with innovative entrepreneurs</p>
<p>will draw a lot of money</p>
<p>and then invest in these companies.</p>
<p>As the market gets larger and larger,</p>
<p>the China market is easily three, four times larger than the US,</p>
<p>they will create greater value and greater returns</p>
<p>for the VCs, thereby raising even more money.</p>
<p>So at Sinovation Ventures, our first fund was 15 million,</p>
<p>our last fund was 500 million.</p>
<p>So it reflects the valuation of the companies</p>
<p>and our us going multi stage and things like that.</p>
<p>It also has government support,</p>
<p>but not in the way most Americans would think of it.</p>
<p>The government actually leaves the entrepreneurial space</p>
<p>as a private enterprise, sort of self regulating,</p>
<p>and the government would build infrastructures</p>
<p>that would around it to make it work better.</p>
<p>For example, the Mass Entrepreneur Mass Innovation Plan</p>
<p>builds 8,000 incubators,</p>
<p>so the pipeline is very strong to the VCs.</p>
<p>For autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>the Chinese government is building smart highways</p>
<p>with sensors, smart cities</p>
<p>that separate pedestrians from cars</p>
<p>that may allow initially an inferior</p>
<p>autonomous vehicle company to launch a car</p>
<p>without increasing with lower casualty</p>
<p>because the roads or the city is smart.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government at local levels</p>
<p>would have these guiding funds acting as LPs,</p>
<p>passive LPs to funds.</p>
<p>And when the fund makes money,</p>
<p>part of the money made is given back</p>
<p>to the GPs and potentially other LPs</p>
<p>to increase everybody&rsquo;s return</p>
<p>at the expense of the government&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting incentive</p>
<p>that entrusts the task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCs</p>
<p>who are better at it than the government</p>
<p>by letting some of the profits move that way.</p>
<p>So this is really fascinating, right?</p>
<p>So I look at the Russian government as a case study</p>
<p>where, let me put it this way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such government driven</p>
<p>large scale support of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>And probably the same is true in the United States,</p>
<p>but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of find a way.</p>
<p>So maybe in a form of advice or explanation,</p>
<p>how did the Chinese government arrive to be this way</p>
<p>so supportive on entrepreneurship</p>
<p>to be in this particular way so forward thinking</p>
<p>at such a large scale?</p>
<p>And also perhaps, how can we copy it in other countries?</p>
<p>How can we encourage other governments,</p>
<p>like even the United States government,</p>
<p>to support infrastructure for autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>in that same kind of way, perhaps?</p>
<p>Yes, so these techniques are</p>
<p>the result of several key things,</p>
<p>some of which may be learnable,</p>
<p>some of which may be very hard.</p>
<p>One is just trial and error</p>
<p>and watching what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to be humble</p>
<p>and not feel like you know all the answers.</p>
<p>The guiding funds idea came from Singapore,</p>
<p>which came from Israel.</p>
<p>And China made a few tweaks and turned it into a,</p>
<p>because the Chinese cities and government officials</p>
<p>kind of compete with each other</p>
<p>because they all want to make their city more successful</p>
<p>so they can get the next level in their political career.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somewhat competitive.</p>
<p>So the central government made it a bit of a competition.</p>
<p>Everybody has a budget.</p>
<p>They can put it on AI or they can put it on bio</p>
<p>or they can put it on energy.</p>
<p>And then whoever gets the results,</p>
<p>the city shines, the people are better off,</p>
<p>the mayor gets a promotion.</p>
<p>So the tools is kind of almost like an entrepreneurial</p>
<p>environment for local governments</p>
<p>to see who can do a better job.</p>
<p>And also many of them try different experiments.</p>
<p>Some have given award to very smart researchers.</p>
<p>Just give them money and hope they&rsquo;ll start a company.</p>
<p>Some have given money to academic research labs,</p>
<p>maybe government research labs</p>
<p>to see if they can spin off some companies</p>
<p>from the science lab or something like that.</p>
<p>Some have tried to recruit overseas Chinese</p>
<p>to come back and start companies.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve had mixed results.</p>
<p>The one that worked the best was the guiding funds.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a lean startup idea</p>
<p>where people try different things</p>
<p>and what works sticks and everybody copies.</p>
<p>So now every city has a guiding fund.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how that came about.</p>
<p>The autonomous vehicle and the massive spending</p>
<p>in highways and smart cities, that&rsquo;s a Chinese way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building infrastructure to facilitate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clear division of the government&rsquo;s responsibility</p>
<p>from the market.</p>
<p>The market should do everything in a private freeway,</p>
<p>but there are things the market can&rsquo;t afford to do</p>
<p>like infrastructure.</p>
<p>So the government always appropriates large amounts</p>
<p>of money for infrastructure building.</p>
<p>This happens with not only autonomous vehicle and AI,</p>
<p>but happened with the 3G and 4G.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that the Chinese wireless reception</p>
<p>is better than the US because massive spending</p>
<p>that tries to cover the whole country,</p>
<p>whereas in the US it may be a little spotty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a government driven because I think they view</p>
<p>the coverage of cell access and 3G, 4G access</p>
<p>to be a governmental infrastructure spending</p>
<p>as opposed to capitalistic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, of course, the state owned enterprises</p>
<p>are also publicly traded,</p>
<p>but they also carry a government responsibility</p>
<p>to deliver infrastructure to all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different way of thinking</p>
<p>that may be very hard to inject into Western countries</p>
<p>to say starting tomorrow, bandwidth infrastructure</p>
<p>and highways are gonna be governmental spending</p>
<p>with some characteristics.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense, and sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s such a fascinating point,</p>
<p>do you think on the autonomous vehicle space</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to solve the problem of full autonomy</p>
<p>without significant investment in infrastructure?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s really hard to speculate.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not a yes, no question,</p>
<p>but how long does it take question?</p>
<p>15 years, 30 years, 45 years.</p>
<p>Clearly with infrastructure augmentation,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s road, the city or whole city planning,</p>
<p>building a new city, I&rsquo;m sure that will accelerate</p>
<p>the day of the L5.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not knowledgeable enough,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to predict even when we&rsquo;re knowledgeable</p>
<p>because a lot of it is speculative.</p>
<p>But in the US, I don&rsquo;t think people would consider</p>
<p>building a new city the size of Chicago</p>
<p>to make it the AI slash autonomous city.</p>
<p>There are smaller ones being built, I&rsquo;m aware of that.</p>
<p>But is infrastructure spend really impossible</p>
<p>for US or Western countries?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>The US highway system was built,</p>
<p>was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy?</p>
<p>Eisenhower, yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe historians can study</p>
<p>how the President Eisenhower get the resources</p>
<p>to build this massive infrastructure</p>
<p>that surely gave US a tremendous amount of prosperity</p>
<p>over the next decade, if not century.</p>
<p>If I may comment on that then,</p>
<p>it takes us to artificial intelligence a little bit</p>
<p>because in order to build infrastructure,</p>
<p>it creates a lot of jobs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be actually interested if you would say</p>
<p>that you talk in your book about all kinds of jobs</p>
<p>that could and could not be automated.</p>
<p>I wonder if building infrastructure is one of the jobs</p>
<p>that would not be easily automated.</p>
<p>Something you could think about</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;ve mentioned somewhere in the talk</p>
<p>or that there might be, as jobs are being automated,</p>
<p>a role for government to create jobs</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be automated.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>Back in the last financial crisis,</p>
<p>China put a lot of money</p>
<p>to basically give this economy a boost</p>
<p>and a lot of it went into infrastructure building.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a legitimate way at the government level</p>
<p>to deal with the employment issues</p>
<p>as well as build out the infrastructure</p>
<p>as long as the infrastructures are truly needed</p>
<p>and as long as there is an employment problem,</p>
<p>which no, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So maybe taking a little step back,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been a leader and a researcher in AI</p>
<p>for several decades, at least 30 years,</p>
<p>so how has AI changed in the West and the East</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve observed, as you&rsquo;ve been deep in it</p>
<p>over the past 30 years?</p>
<p>Well, AI began as the pursuit</p>
<p>of understanding human intelligence</p>
<p>and the term itself represents that,</p>
<p>but it kind of drifted into the one sub area</p>
<p>that worked extremely well, which is machine intelligence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually more using pattern recognition techniques</p>
<p>to basically do incredibly well on a limited domain,</p>
<p>large amount of data,</p>
<p>but relatively simple kinds of planning tasks</p>
<p>and not very creative.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t end up building human intelligence.</p>
<p>We built a different machine</p>
<p>that was a lot better than us, some problems,</p>
<p>but nowhere close to us on other problems.</p>
<p>So today, I think a lot of people still misunderstand</p>
<p>when we say artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and what various products can do,</p>
<p>people still think it&rsquo;s about replicating</p>
<p>human intelligence,</p>
<p>but the products out there really are closer</p>
<p>to having invented the internet or the spreadsheet</p>
<p>or the database and getting broader adoption.</p>
<p>And speaking further to the fears,</p>
<p>near term fears that people have about AI,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re commenting on the sort of general intelligence</p>
<p>that people in the popular culture from sci fi movies</p>
<p>have a sense about AI,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s practical fears about AI,</p>
<p>the narrow AI that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>of automating particular kinds of jobs</p>
<p>and you talk about them in the book.</p>
<p>So what are the kinds of jobs in your view</p>
<p>that you see in the next five, 10 years</p>
<p>beginning to be automated by AI systems algorithms?</p>
<p>Yes, this is also maybe a little bit counterintuitive</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the routine jobs</p>
<p>that will be displaced the soonest</p>
<p>and they may not be displaced entirely,</p>
<p>maybe 50%, 80% of a job,</p>
<p>but when the workload drops by that much,</p>
<p>employment will come down.</p>
<p>And also another part of misunderstanding</p>
<p>is most people think of AI replacing routine jobs</p>
<p>than they think of the assembly line, the workers.</p>
<p>Well, that will have some effect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually the routine white collar workers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easiest to replace</p>
<p>because to replace a white collar worker,</p>
<p>you just need software.</p>
<p>To replace a blue collar worker,</p>
<p>you need robotics, mechanical excellence,</p>
<p>and the ability to deal with dexterity</p>
<p>and maybe even unknown environments, very, very difficult.</p>
<p>So if we were to categorize the most dangerous</p>
<p>white collar jobs,</p>
<p>they would be things like back office,</p>
<p>people who copy and paste</p>
<p>and deal with simple computer programs and data</p>
<p>and maybe paper and OCR,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t make strategic decisions.</p>
<p>They basically facilitate the process.</p>
<p>These softwares and paper systems don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So you have people dealing with new employee orientation,</p>
<p>searching for past lawsuits and financial documents,</p>
<p>and doing reference check.</p>
<p>So basic searching and management of data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most endangered being lost.</p>
<p>In addition to the white collar repetitive work,</p>
<p>a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken care of</p>
<p>such as telesales, telemarketing, customer service,</p>
<p>as well as many physical jobs</p>
<p>that are in the same location</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t require a high degree of dexterity.</p>
<p>So fruit picking, dishwashing, assembly line inspection</p>
<p>are jobs in that category.</p>
<p>So altogether, back office is a big part.</p>
<p>And the blue collar may be smaller initially,</p>
<p>but over time, AI will get better.</p>
<p>And when we start to get to over the next 15, 20 years,</p>
<p>the ability to actually have the dexterity</p>
<p>of doing assembly line, that&rsquo;s a huge chunk of jobs.</p>
<p>And when autonomous vehicles start to work,</p>
<p>initially starting with truck drivers,</p>
<p>but eventually to all drivers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another huge group of workers.</p>
<p>So I see modest numbers in the next five years,</p>
<p>but increasing rapidly after that.</p>
<p>On the worry of the jobs that are in danger</p>
<p>and the gradual loss of jobs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a candidate for president of the United States</p>
<p>whose platform Andrew Yang is based around,</p>
<p>in part around job loss due to automation.</p>
<p>And also in addition,</p>
<p>the need perhaps of universal basic income</p>
<p>to support jobs that are,</p>
<p>folks who lose their job due to automation and so on.</p>
<p>And in general, support people</p>
<p>under complex, unstable job market.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about his concerns,</p>
<p>him as a candidate, his ideas in general?</p>
<p>I think his thinking is generally in the right direction,</p>
<p>but his approach as a presidential candidate</p>
<p>may be a little bit ahead of the time.</p>
<p>And I think the displacements will happen,</p>
<p>but will they happen soon enough</p>
<p>for people to agree to vote for him?</p>
<p>The unemployment numbers are not very high yet.</p>
<p>And I think he and I have the same challenge.</p>
<p>If I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue</p>
<p>and he wants to become the president,</p>
<p>people have to see how can this be the case</p>
<p>when unemployment numbers are low.</p>
<p>So that is the challenge.</p>
<p>And I think I do agree with him on the displacement issue,</p>
<p>on universal basic income.</p>
<p>At a very vanilla level, I don&rsquo;t agree with it</p>
<p>because I think the main issue is retraining.</p>
<p>So people need to be incented</p>
<p>not by just giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000 check</p>
<p>and do whatever they want</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the know how</p>
<p>to know what to retrain to go into what type of a job.</p>
<p>And guidance is needed.</p>
<p>And retraining is needed</p>
<p>because historically when technology revolutions,</p>
<p>when routine jobs were displaced, new routine jobs came up.</p>
<p>So there was always room for that.</p>
<p>But with AI and automation,</p>
<p>the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually.</p>
<p>So there will be fewer and fewer routine jobs.</p>
<p>And AI will create jobs, but it won&rsquo;t create routine jobs</p>
<p>because if it creates routine jobs,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t AI just do it?</p>
<p>So therefore the people who are losing the jobs</p>
<p>are losing routine jobs.</p>
<p>The jobs that are becoming available are non routine jobs.</p>
<p>So the social stipend needs to be put in place</p>
<p>is for the routine workers who lost their jobs</p>
<p>to be retrained maybe in six months, maybe in three years,</p>
<p>takes a while to retrain on the non routine job</p>
<p>and then take on a job that will last</p>
<p>for that person&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>Now, having said that,</p>
<p>if you look deeply into Andrew&rsquo;s document,</p>
<p>he does cater for that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with what he&rsquo;s trying to do.</p>
<p>But for simplification, sometimes he just says UBI,</p>
<p>but simple UBI wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ve mentioned elsewhere</p>
<p>that the goal isn&rsquo;t necessarily to give people enough money</p>
<p>to survive or live, or even to prosper.</p>
<p>The point is to give them a job that gives them meaning.</p>
<p>That meaning is extremely important.</p>
<p>That our employment, at least in the United States</p>
<p>and perhaps it carries across the world,</p>
<p>provides something that&rsquo;s, forgive me for saying,</p>
<p>greater than money.</p>
<p>It provides meaning.</p>
<p>So now, what kind of jobs do you think can&rsquo;t be automated?</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about creativity</p>
<p>and compassion in your book?</p>
<p>What aspects do you think it&rsquo;s difficult to automate</p>
<p>for an AI system?</p>
<p>Because an AI system is currently merely optimizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not able to reason, plan,</p>
<p>or think creatively or strategically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not able to deal with complex problems.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t come up with a new problem and solve it.</p>
<p>A human needs to find the problem</p>
<p>and pose it as an optimization problem,</p>
<p>then have the AI work at it.</p>
<p>So an AI would have a very hard time discovering a new drug</p>
<p>or discovering a new style of painting</p>
<p>or dealing with complex tasks such as managing a company</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just about optimizing the bottom line,</p>
<p>but also about employee satisfaction, corporate brand,</p>
<p>and many, many other things.</p>
<p>So that is one category of things.</p>
<p>And because these things are challenging, creative, complex,</p>
<p>doing them creates a high degree of satisfaction</p>
<p>and therefore appealing to our desire for working,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t just to make the money, make the ends meet,</p>
<p>but also that we&rsquo;ve accomplished something</p>
<p>that others maybe can&rsquo;t do or can&rsquo;t do as well.</p>
<p>Another type of job that is much numerous</p>
<p>would be compassionate jobs, jobs that require compassion,</p>
<p>empathy, human touch, human trust.</p>
<p>AI can&rsquo;t do that because AI is cold, calculating,</p>
<p>and even if it can fake that to some extent,</p>
<p>it will make errors and that will make it look very silly.</p>
<p>And also, I think even if AI did okay,</p>
<p>people would want to interact with another person,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s for some kind of a service or a teacher</p>
<p>or a doctor or a concierge or a masseuse or a bartender.</p>
<p>There are so many jobs where people just don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to interact with a cold robot or software.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an entrepreneur who built an elderly care robot</p>
<p>and they found that the elderly really only use it</p>
<p>for customer service.</p>
<p>And not, but not to service the product,</p>
<p>but they click on customer service</p>
<p>and the video of a person comes up</p>
<p>and then the person says,</p>
<p>how come my daughter didn&rsquo;t call me?</p>
<p>Let me show you a picture of her grandkids.</p>
<p>So people yearn for that people, people interaction.</p>
<p>So even if robots improved, people just don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>And those jobs are going to be increasing</p>
<p>because AI will create a lot of value,</p>
<p>$16 trillion to the world in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Next 11 years, according to PWC.</p>
<p>And that will give people money to enjoy services,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s eating a gourmet meal or tourism and traveling</p>
<p>or having concierge services,</p>
<p>the services revolving around every dollar</p>
<p>of that $16 trillion will be tremendous.</p>
<p>It will create more opportunities</p>
<p>that are to service the people who did well</p>
<p>through AI with things.</p>
<p>But even at the same time,</p>
<p>the entire society is very much short</p>
<p>in need of many service oriented,</p>
<p>compassionate oriented jobs.</p>
<p>The best example is probably in healthcare services.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be 2 million new jobs,</p>
<p>not counting replacement,</p>
<p>just brand new incremental jobs</p>
<p>in the next six years in healthcare services.</p>
<p>That includes nurses, orderly in the hospital,</p>
<p>elderly care and also at home care is particularly lacking.</p>
<p>And those jobs are not likely to be filled.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s likely to be a shortage.</p>
<p>And the reason they&rsquo;re not filled</p>
<p>is simply because they don&rsquo;t pay very well</p>
<p>and that the social status of these jobs are not very good.</p>
<p>So they pay about half as much</p>
<p>as a heavy equipment operator,</p>
<p>which will be replaced a lot sooner.</p>
<p>And they pay probably comparably</p>
<p>to someone on the assembly line.</p>
<p>And so if we ignoring all the other issues</p>
<p>and just think about satisfaction from one&rsquo;s job,</p>
<p>someone repetitively doing the same manual action</p>
<p>at an assembly line,</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t create a lot of job satisfaction,</p>
<p>but someone taking care of a sick person</p>
<p>and getting a hug and thank you</p>
<p>from that person and the family,</p>
<p>I think is quite satisfying.</p>
<p>So if only we could fix the pay for service jobs,</p>
<p>there are plenty of jobs that require some training</p>
<p>or a lot of training</p>
<p>for the people coming off the routine jobs to take.</p>
<p>We can easily imagine someone</p>
<p>who was maybe a cashier at the grocery store</p>
<p>as stores become automated,</p>
<p>learns to become a nurse or an at home care.</p>
<p>I also do want to point out the blue collar jobs</p>
<p>are going to stay around a bit longer.</p>
<p>Some of them quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>AI cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Arguably it&rsquo;s an L5 level of difficulty, right?</p>
<p>And then AI cannot be a good plumber</p>
<p>because plumber is almost like a mini detective</p>
<p>that has to figure out where the leak came from.</p>
<p>So yet AI probably can be an assembly line</p>
<p>and auto mechanic and so on.</p>
<p>So one has to study which blue collar jobs are going away</p>
<p>and facilitate retraining for the people</p>
<p>to go into the ones that won&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>or maybe even will increase.</p>
<p>I mean, it is fascinating that it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>to build a world champion chess player</p>
<p>than it is to build a mediocre plumber.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>And to AI and that goes counterintuitive</p>
<p>to a lot of people&rsquo;s understanding</p>
<p>of what artificial intelligence is.</p>
<p>So it sounds, I mean, you&rsquo;re painting</p>
<p>a pretty optimistic picture about retraining</p>
<p>about the number of jobs</p>
<p>and actually the meaningful nature of those jobs</p>
<p>once we automate the repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>So overall, are you optimistic about the future</p>
<p>where much of the repetitive tasks are automated?</p>
<p>That there is a lot of room for humans</p>
<p>for the compassionate, for the creative input</p>
<p>that only humans can provide?</p>
<p>I am optimistic if we start to take action.</p>
<p>If we have no action in the next five years,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to deal</p>
<p>with the devastating losses that will emerge.</p>
<p>So if we start thinking about retraining,</p>
<p>maybe with the low hanging fruits,</p>
<p>explaining to vocational schools</p>
<p>why they should train more plumbers than auto mechanics,</p>
<p>maybe starting with some government subsidy</p>
<p>for corporations to have more training positions.</p>
<p>We start to explain to people why retraining is important.</p>
<p>We start to think about what the future of education,</p>
<p>how that needs to be tweaked for the era of AI.</p>
<p>If we start to make incremental progress</p>
<p>and the greater number of people understand,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no reason to think we can&rsquo;t deal with this</p>
<p>because this technological revolution</p>
<p>is arguably similar to what electricity,</p>
<p>industrial revolutions, and internet brought about.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a role for policy,</p>
<p>for governments to step in,</p>
<p>to help with policy to create a better world?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and the governments don&rsquo;t have to believe</p>
<p>an employment will go up,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have to believe automation will be this fast</p>
<p>to do something.</p>
<p>Revamping vocational school would be one example.</p>
<p>Another is if there&rsquo;s a big gap</p>
<p>in healthcare service employment,</p>
<p>and we know that a country&rsquo;s population is growing older,</p>
<p>more longevity, living older,</p>
<p>because people over 80 require five times as much care</p>
<p>as those under 80,</p>
<p>then it is a good time to incent training programs</p>
<p>for elderly care to find ways to improve the pay.</p>
<p>Maybe one way would be to offer as part of Medicare</p>
<p>or the equivalent program for people over 80</p>
<p>to be entitled to a few hours of elderly care at home,</p>
<p>and then that might be reimbursable,</p>
<p>and that will stimulate the service industry</p>
<p>around the policy.</p>
<p>Do you have concerns about large entities,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s governments or companies,</p>
<p>controlling the future of AI development in general?</p>
<p>So we talked about companies.</p>
<p>Do you have a better sense that governments</p>
<p>can better represent the interests of the people</p>
<p>than companies, or do you believe companies</p>
<p>are better at representing the interests of the people?</p>
<p>Or is there no easy answer?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an easy answer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a double edged sword.</p>
<p>The companies and governments can provide better services</p>
<p>with more access to data and more access to AI,</p>
<p>but that also leads to greater power,</p>
<p>which can lead to uncontrollable problems,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s monopoly or corruption in the government.</p>
<p>So I think one has to be careful</p>
<p>to look at how much data that companies and governments have</p>
<p>and some kind of checks and balances would be helpful.</p>
<p>So again, I come from Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called the Cold War.</p>
<p>So let me ask a difficult question here</p>
<p>looking at conflict.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker written a great book</p>
<p>that conflict all over the world is decreasing in general.</p>
<p>But do you have a sense that having written</p>
<p>the book AI Superpowers,</p>
<p>do you see a major international conflict</p>
<p>potentially arising between major nations,</p>
<p>whatever they are, whether it&rsquo;s Russia, China,</p>
<p>European nations, United States or others</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20, 50 years around AI,</p>
<p>around the digital space, cyberspace?</p>
<p>Do you worry about that?</p>
<p>Is that something we need to think about</p>
<p>and try to alleviate or prevent?</p>
<p>I believe in greater engagement.</p>
<p>A lot of the worries about more powerful AI</p>
<p>are based on a arms race metaphor.</p>
<p>And when you extrapolate into military kinds of scenarios,</p>
<p>AI can automate and autonomous weapons</p>
<p>that needs to be controlled somehow</p>
<p>and autonomous decision making</p>
<p>can lead to not enough time to fix international crises.</p>
<p>So I actually believe a Cold War mentality</p>
<p>would be very dangerous</p>
<p>because should two countries rely on AI</p>
<p>to make certain decisions</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even talk to each other,</p>
<p>they do their own scenario planning,</p>
<p>then something could easily go wrong.</p>
<p>I think engagement, interaction, some protocols</p>
<p>to avoid inadvertent disasters is actually needed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s natural for each country to want to be the best,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in nuclear technologies or AI or bio.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important to realize</p>
<p>if each country has a black box AI</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t talk to each other,</p>
<p>that probably presents greater challenges to humanity</p>
<p>than if they interacted.</p>
<p>I think there can still be competition,</p>
<p>but with some degree of protocol for interaction,</p>
<p>just like when there was a nuclear competition,</p>
<p>there were some protocol for deterrence</p>
<p>among US, Russia, and China.</p>
<p>And I think that engagement is needed.</p>
<p>So of course, we&rsquo;re still far from AI</p>
<p>presenting that kind of danger.</p>
<p>But what I worry the most about</p>
<p>is the level of engagement seems to be coming down.</p>
<p>The level of distrust seems to be going up,</p>
<p>especially from the US towards other large countries</p>
<p>such as China and of course, and Russia, yes.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make that better?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s beautifully put level of engagement</p>
<p>and even just basic trust and communication</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of making artificial enemies</p>
<p>out of particular countries.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense how we can make it better?</p>
<p>Actionable items that as a society we can take on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert at geopolitics,</p>
<p>but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind</p>
<p>when we are faced with the opportunity</p>
<p>to create $16 trillion for humanity,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;re not solving fundamental problems</p>
<p>with parts of the world still in poverty.</p>
<p>And for the first time,</p>
<p>we have the resources to overcome poverty and hunger.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not using it on that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re fueling competition among superpowers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>If we become utopian for a moment,</p>
<p>imagine a benevolent world government</p>
<p>that has this $16 trillion and maybe some AI</p>
<p>to figure out how to use it to deal with diseases</p>
<p>and problems and hate and things like that.</p>
<p>World would be a lot better off.</p>
<p>So what is wrong with the current world?</p>
<p>I think the people with more skill than I</p>
<p>should think about this.</p>
<p>And then the geopolitics issue with superpower competition</p>
<p>is one side of the issue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another side which I worry maybe even more,</p>
<p>which is as the $16 trillion all gets made by US and China</p>
<p>and a few of the other developed countries,</p>
<p>the poorer country will get nothing</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have technology</p>
<p>and the wealth disparity and inequality will increase.</p>
<p>So a poorer country with a large population</p>
<p>will not only benefit from the AI boom</p>
<p>or other technology booms,</p>
<p>but they will have their workers</p>
<p>who previously had hoped they could do the China model</p>
<p>and do outsource manufacturing or the India model</p>
<p>so they could do the outsource process or call center.</p>
<p>Well, all those jobs are gonna be gone in 10 or 15 years.</p>
<p>So the individual citizen may be a net liability,</p>
<p>I mean, financially speaking to a poorer country</p>
<p>and not an asset to claw itself out of poverty.</p>
<p>So in that kind of situation,</p>
<p>these large countries with not much tech</p>
<p>are going to be facing a downward spiral</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear what could be done.</p>
<p>And then when we look back</p>
<p>and say there&rsquo;s $16 trillion being created</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all being kept by US, China</p>
<p>and other developed countries, it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>So I hope people who know about geopolitics</p>
<p>can find solutions that&rsquo;s beyond my expertise.</p>
<p>So different countries that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>have different value systems.</p>
<p>If you look at the United States,</p>
<p>to an almost extreme degree,</p>
<p>there is an absolute desire for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>If you look at a country where I was raised,</p>
<p>that desire just amongst the people</p>
<p>is not as elevated as it is to basically fundamental level</p>
<p>to the essence of what it means to be America, right?</p>
<p>And the same is true with China,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different value systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some censorship of internet content</p>
<p>that China and Russia and many other countries undertake.</p>
<p>Do you see that having effects on innovation,</p>
<p>other aspects of some of the tech stuff,</p>
<p>AI development we talked about,</p>
<p>and maybe from another angle,</p>
<p>do you see that changing in different ways</p>
<p>over the next 10 years, 20 years, 50 years</p>
<p>as China continues to grow as it does now</p>
<p>in its tech innovation?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a common belief</p>
<p>that full freedom of speech and expression</p>
<p>is correlated with creativity,</p>
<p>which is correlated with entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p>I think empirically we have seen that is not true</p>
<p>and China has been successful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the fundamental values are not right</p>
<p>or not the best,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just that perfect correlation isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to read the tea leaves on opening up or not</p>
<p>in any country,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve not been very good at that in my past predictions,</p>
<p>but I do believe every country</p>
<p>shares a lot of fundamental values for the longterm.</p>
<p>So China is drafting its privacy policy</p>
<p>for individual citizens,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t look that different</p>
<p>from the American or European ones.</p>
<p>So people do want to protect their privacy</p>
<p>and have the opportunity to express</p>
<p>and I think the fundamental values are there.</p>
<p>The question is in the execution and timing,</p>
<p>how soon or when will that start to open up?</p>
<p>So as long as each government knows</p>
<p>ultimately people want that kind of protection,</p>
<p>there should be a plan to move towards that</p>
<p>as to when or how and I&rsquo;m not an expert.</p>
<p>On the point of privacy to me, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So AI needs data to create</p>
<p>a personalized awesome experience, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking generally in terms of products.</p>
<p>And then we have currently, depending on the age</p>
<p>and depending on the demographics of who we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>some people are more or less concerned</p>
<p>about the amount of data they hand over.</p>
<p>So in your view, how do we get this balance right</p>
<p>that we provide an amazing experience</p>
<p>to people that use products?</p>
<p>You look at Facebook, the more Facebook knows about you,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s scary to say, the better it can probably,</p>
<p>better experience it can probably create.</p>
<p>So in your view, how do we get that balance right?</p>
<p>Yes, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s okay and possible to just rip all the data out</p>
<p>from a provider and give it back to you.</p>
<p>So you can deny them access to further data</p>
<p>and still enjoy the services we have.</p>
<p>If we take back all the data,</p>
<p>all the services will give us nonsense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll no longer be able to use products that function well</p>
<p>in terms of right ranking, right products,</p>
<p>right user experience.</p>
<p>So yet I do understand we don&rsquo;t want to permit misuse</p>
<p>of the data from legal policy standpoint.</p>
<p>I think there can be severe punishment</p>
<p>for those who have egregious misuse of the data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think a good first step.</p>
<p>Actually China in this side on this aspect</p>
<p>has very strong laws about people who sell</p>
<p>or give data to other companies.</p>
<p>And that over the past few years,</p>
<p>since that law came into effect,</p>
<p>pretty much eradicated the illegal distribution,</p>
<p>sharing of data.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think giving,</p>
<p>I think technology is often a very good way</p>
<p>to solve technology misuse.</p>
<p>So can we come up with new technologies</p>
<p>that will let us have our cake and eat it too?</p>
<p>People are looking into homomorphic encryption,</p>
<p>which is letting you keep the data,</p>
<p>have it encrypted and train on encrypted data.</p>
<p>Of course, we haven&rsquo;t solved that one yet,</p>
<p>but that kind of direction may be worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Also federated learning,</p>
<p>which would allow one hospital</p>
<p>to train on its hospital&rsquo;s patient data fully</p>
<p>because they have a license for that.</p>
<p>And then hospitals would then share their models,</p>
<p>not data, but models to create a super AI.</p>
<p>And that also maybe has some promise.</p>
<p>So I would want to encourage us to be open minded</p>
<p>and think of this as not just the policy binary, yes, no,</p>
<p>but letting the technologists try to find solutions</p>
<p>to let us have our cake and eat it too,</p>
<p>or have most of our cake and eat most of it too.</p>
<p>Finally, I think giving each end user a choice is important</p>
<p>and having transparency is important.</p>
<p>Also, I think that&rsquo;s universal,</p>
<p>but the choice you give to the user</p>
<p>should not be at a granular level</p>
<p>that the user cannot understand.</p>
<p>GDPR today causes all these popups of yes, no,</p>
<p>will you give this site this right</p>
<p>to use this part of your data?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any user understands</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying yes or no to.</p>
<p>And I suspect most are just saying yes</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>So while GDPR in its current implementation</p>
<p>has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choice,</p>
<p>it implemented it in such a way</p>
<p>that really didn&rsquo;t deliver the spirit of GDPR.</p>
<p>It fit the letter, but not the spirit.</p>
<p>So again, I think we need to think about</p>
<p>is there a way to fit the spirit of GDPR</p>
<p>by using some kind of technology?</p>
<p>Can we have a slider that&rsquo;s an AI trying to figure out</p>
<p>how much you want to slide between</p>
<p>perfect protection security of your personal data</p>
<p>versus a high degree of convenience</p>
<p>with some risks of not having full privacy?</p>
<p>Each user should have some preference</p>
<p>and that gives you the user choice.</p>
<p>But maybe we should turn the problem on its head</p>
<p>and ask can there be an AI algorithm that can customize this?</p>
<p>Because we can understand the slider,</p>
<p>but we sure cannot understand every popup question.</p>
<p>And I think getting that right</p>
<p>requires getting the balance between</p>
<p>what we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which is heart and soul</p>
<p>versus profit driven decisions and strategy.</p>
<p>I think from my perspective,</p>
<p>the best way to make a lot of money in the long term</p>
<p>is to keep your heart and soul intact.</p>
<p>I think getting that slider right in the short term</p>
<p>may feel like you&rsquo;ll be sacrificing profit,</p>
<p>but in the long term,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be gaining user trust</p>
<p>and providing a great experience.</p>
<p>Do you share that kind of view in general?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I sure would hope there is a way</p>
<p>we can do long term projects</p>
<p>that really do the right thing.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people who embrace GDPR,</p>
<p>their heart&rsquo;s in the right place.</p>
<p>I think they just need to figure out how to build a solution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard utopians talk about solutions</p>
<p>that get me excited,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure how in the current funding environment</p>
<p>they can get started.</p>
<p>People talk about,</p>
<p>imagine this crowdsourced data collection</p>
<p>that we all trust.</p>
<p>And then we have these agents</p>
<p>that we ask the trusted agent to&hellip;</p>
<p>That agent only, that platform,</p>
<p>so a trusted joint platform</p>
<p>that we all believe is trustworthy,</p>
<p>that can give us all the closed loop personal suggestions</p>
<p>by the new social network, new search engine,</p>
<p>new eCommerce engine that has access</p>
<p>to even more of our data,</p>
<p>but not directly, but indirectly.</p>
<p>So I think that general concept</p>
<p>of licensing to some trusted engine</p>
<p>and finding a way to trust that engine</p>
<p>seems like a great idea.</p>
<p>But if you think how long it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>to implement and tweak and develop it right,</p>
<p>as well as to collect all the trusts</p>
<p>and the data from the people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beyond the current cycle of venture capital.</p>
<p>So how do you do that is a big question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve recently had a fight with cancer,</p>
<p>stage four lymphoma and in a sort of deep personal level,</p>
<p>what did it feel like in the darker moments</p>
<p>to face your own mortality?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been the workaholic my whole life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve basically worked nine, nine, six,</p>
<p>nine a.m. to nine p.m. six days a week, roughly.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really pay a lot of attention</p>
<p>to my family, friends, and people who loved me.</p>
<p>And my life revolved around optimizing for work.</p>
<p>While my work was not routine,</p>
<p>my optimization really what made my life</p>
<p>basically very mechanical process.</p>
<p>But I got a lot of highs out of it</p>
<p>because of accomplishments</p>
<p>that I thought were really important and dear</p>
<p>and the highest priority to me.</p>
<p>But when I faced mortality</p>
<p>and the possible death in matter of months,</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t feel like working for another minute,</p>
<p>that if I had six months left in my life,</p>
<p>I would spend it all with my loved ones</p>
<p>and thanking them, giving them love back</p>
<p>and apologizing to them that I lived my life the wrong way.</p>
<p>So that moment of reckoning</p>
<p>caused me to really rethink that why we exist in this world</p>
<p>is something that we might be too much shaped by the society</p>
<p>to think that success and accomplishments is why we live.</p>
<p>But while that can get you</p>
<p>periodic successes and satisfaction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really in the facing death</p>
<p>you see what&rsquo;s truly important to you.</p>
<p>So as a result of going through the challenges with cancer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve resolved to live a more balanced lifestyle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now in remission, knock on wood,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m spending more time with my family.</p>
<p>My wife travels with me.</p>
<p>When my kids need me, I spend more time with them.</p>
<p>And before I used to prioritize everything around work.</p>
<p>When I had a little bit of time,</p>
<p>I would dole it out to my family.</p>
<p>Now, when my family needs something, really needs something,</p>
<p>I drop everything at work and go to them.</p>
<p>And then in the time remaining, I allocate to work.</p>
<p>But one&rsquo;s family is very understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they will take 50 hours a week from me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually able to still work pretty hard,</p>
<p>maybe 10 hours less per week.</p>
<p>So I realized the most important thing in my life</p>
<p>is really love and the people I love.</p>
<p>And I give that the highest priority.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t the only thing I do,</p>
<p>but when that is needed, I put that at the top priority</p>
<p>and I feel much better and I feel much more balanced.</p>
<p>And I think this also gives a hint</p>
<p>as to a life of routine work, a life of pursuit of numbers.</p>
<p>While my job was not routine, it was in pursuit of numbers,</p>
<p>pursuit of can I make more money?</p>
<p>Can I fund more great companies?</p>
<p>Can I raise more money?</p>
<p>Can I make sure our VC is ranked higher and higher</p>
<p>every year?</p>
<p>This competitive nature of driving for bigger numbers</p>
<p>and better numbers became a endless pursuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mechanical.</p>
<p>And bigger numbers really didn&rsquo;t make me happier.</p>
<p>And faced with death, I realized bigger numbers</p>
<p>really meant nothing.</p>
<p>And what was important is that people who have given</p>
<p>their heart and their love to me</p>
<p>deserve for me to do the same.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s deep, profound truth in that,</p>
<p>that everyone should hear and internalize.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really powerful for you to say that.</p>
<p>I have to ask sort of a difficult question here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve competed in sports my whole life,</p>
<p>looking historically, I&rsquo;d like to challenge some aspect</p>
<p>of that a little bit on the point of hard work.</p>
<p>That it feels that there are certain aspects</p>
<p>that is the greatest, the most beautiful aspects</p>
<p>of human nature is the ability to become obsessed,</p>
<p>of becoming extremely passionate to the point where yes,</p>
<p>flaws are revealed and just giving yourself fully to a task.</p>
<p>That is, in another sense, you mentioned love</p>
<p>being important, but in another sense,</p>
<p>this kind of obsession, this pure exhibition of passion</p>
<p>and hard work is truly what it means to be human.</p>
<p>What lessons should we take that&rsquo;s deeper?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve accomplished incredible things.</p>
<p>You say it chasing numbers,</p>
<p>but really there&rsquo;s some incredible work there.</p>
<p>So how do you think about that when you look back</p>
<p>in your 20s, your 30s, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>Would you really take back some of the incredible hard work?</p>
<p>I would, but it&rsquo;s in percentages, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both computer scientists.</p>
<p>So I think when one balances one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>when one is younger, you might give a smaller percentage</p>
<p>to family, but you would still give them high priority.</p>
<p>And when you get older, you would give a larger percentage</p>
<p>to them and still the high priority.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re near retirement, you give most of it to them</p>
<p>and the highest priority.</p>
<p>So I think the key point is not that we would work 20 hours</p>
<p>less for the whole life and just spend it aimlessly</p>
<p>with the family, but that&rsquo;s when the family has a need,</p>
<p>when your wife is having a baby,</p>
<p>when your daughter has a birthday or when they&rsquo;re depressed</p>
<p>or when they&rsquo;re celebrating something</p>
<p>or when they have a get together or when we have family time</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important for us to put down our phone and PC</p>
<p>and be a hundred percent with them.</p>
<p>And that priority on the things that really matter</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to be so taxing that it would eliminate</p>
<p>or even dramatically reduce our accomplishments.</p>
<p>It might have some impact, but it might also have</p>
<p>other impact because if you have a happier family,</p>
<p>maybe you fight less.</p>
<p>If you fight less, you don&rsquo;t spend time taking care</p>
<p>of all the aftermath of a fight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unclear that it would take more time.</p>
<p>And if it did, I&rsquo;d be willing to take that reduction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a dramatic number, but it&rsquo;s a number</p>
<p>that I think would give me a greater degree of happiness</p>
<p>and knowing that I&rsquo;ve done the right thing</p>
<p>and still have plenty of hours to get the success</p>
<p>that I want to get.</p>
<p>So given the many successful companies that you&rsquo;ve launched</p>
<p>and much success throughout your career,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to young people today looking,</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t have to be young,</p>
<p>but people today looking to launch</p>
<p>and to create the next $1 billion tech startup</p>
<p>or even AI based startup?</p>
<p>I would suggest that people understand</p>
<p>technology waves move quickly.</p>
<p>What worked two years ago may not work today.</p>
<p>And that is very much case in point for AI.</p>
<p>I think two years ago, or maybe three years ago,</p>
<p>you certainly could say I have a couple</p>
<p>of super smart PhDs and we&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re gonna do, but here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>and get funding for a very high valuation.</p>
<p>Those days are over because AI is going</p>
<p>from rocket science towards mainstream,</p>
<p>not yet commodity, but more mainstream.</p>
<p>So first the creation of any company</p>
<p>to a venture capitalists has to be creation</p>
<p>of business value and monetary value.</p>
<p>And when you have a very scarce commodity,</p>
<p>VCs may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.</p>
<p>But now the number of people who have the equivalent</p>
<p>of PhD three years ago, because that can be learned</p>
<p>more quickly, platforms are emerging,</p>
<p>the cost to become a AI engineer is much lower</p>
<p>and there are many more AI engineers.</p>
<p>So the market is different.</p>
<p>So I would suggest someone who wants to build an AI company</p>
<p>be thinking about the normal business questions.</p>
<p>What customer cases are you trying to address?</p>
<p>What kind of pain are you trying to address?</p>
<p>How does that translate to value?</p>
<p>How will you extract value and get paid</p>
<p>through what channel and how much business value</p>
<p>will get created?</p>
<p>That today needs to be thought about much earlier upfront</p>
<p>than it did three years ago.</p>
<p>The scarcity question of AI talent has changed.</p>
<p>The number of AI talent has changed.</p>
<p>So now you need not just AI, but also understanding</p>
<p>of business customer and the marketplace.</p>
<p>So I also think you should have a more reasonable</p>
<p>valuation expectation and growth expectation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be more competition.</p>
<p>But the good news though, is that AI technologies</p>
<p>are now more available in open source.</p>
<p>TensorFlow, PyTorch and such tools are much easier to use.</p>
<p>So you should be able to experiment and get results</p>
<p>iteratively faster than before.</p>
<p>So take more of a business mindset to this,</p>
<p>think less of this as a laboratory taken into a company,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve gone beyond that stage.</p>
<p>The only exception is if you truly have a breakthrough</p>
<p>in some technology that really no one has,</p>
<p>then the old way still works.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s harder and harder now.</p>
<p>So I know you believe as many do that we&rsquo;re far</p>
<p>from creating an artificial general intelligence system.</p>
<p>But say once we do, and you get to ask her one question,</p>
<p>what would that question be?</p>
<p>What is it that differentiates you and me?</p>
<p>Beautifully put, Kaifu, thank you so much</p>
<p>for your time today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
