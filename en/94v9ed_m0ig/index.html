<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>this is the dr. Berg show live from the</p>
<p>nation&rsquo;s capital it&rsquo;s time to get</p>
<p>healthy lose weight and feel great</p>
<p>call now to speak with dr. Berg at eight</p>
<p>six six five six one four two nine two</p>
<p>and now dr. Eric Berg hey guys welcome</p>
<p>back it&rsquo;s Friday morning and we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>take your calls and we have Karen in the</p>
<p>house today so yeah so we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a lot of questions lined up so so oh and</p>
<p>anything that I say is not meant to</p>
<p>diagnose you or give you replace medical</p>
<p>advice it&rsquo;s just meant for you to do</p>
<p>more research with you and your doctor</p>
<p>and then come up with your own</p>
<p>conclusions okay good that being said</p>
<p>anything you say can and will be used</p>
<p>against yes that&rsquo;s right in the home in</p>
<p>the kitchen that&rsquo;s right okay all right</p>
<p>so hey Derek he&rsquo;s a regular caller from</p>
<p>Queens you had a question Derek how you</p>
<p>doing hey dr. Berg how you doing good</p>
<p>hey I&rsquo;m also a year-round member of your</p>
<p>keto and is group and it&rsquo;s just uh just</p>
<p>an amazing platform it really is awesome</p>
<p>right which leads me to my to my concern</p>
<p>today I have a have a really terrible</p>
<p>third that has kind of thrown me off the</p>
<p>keto and is and and it actually started</p>
<p>from the if&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been battling this</p>
<p>since basically last August every time I</p>
<p>go through long periods of fasting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like my stomach my stomach acid starts</p>
<p>bubbling up and then this crazy acid</p>
<p>reflux starts a non-stop and it&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>been like almost 30 days now this is</p>
<p>going on it just doesn&rsquo;t stop the valve</p>
<p>the valve does not close like your music</p>
<p>teacher I started taking I was taking</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>10 betaine hydrochloride capsules with</p>
<p>each meal I&rsquo;ve done basically everything</p>
<p>that I know of them basically that you</p>
<p>spoke on it so as I have a question I</p>
<p>have a question for you</p>
<p>did they ever scope the stomach and tell</p>
<p>you what&rsquo;s going on with the lining of</p>
<p>the stomach is there any type of</p>
<p>inflammatory thing going on lining the</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>yes I had an endoscopy end of December</p>
<p>and there was a inflammation and in my</p>
<p>stomach duodenum and well actually the</p>
<p>legend actually showed one inflammation</p>
<p>and then five other places that said</p>
<p>benign okay and two were in my esophagus</p>
<p>one in my stomach and two in my duodenum</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna recommend</p>
<p>Eric there&rsquo;s a couple things number one</p>
<p>obviously the inflammation to have that</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s a chronic problem which</p>
<p>is going to take some work but in this</p>
<p>situation even though you need acidifier</p>
<p>zand episode of vinegar and betaine how</p>
<p>to chloride and all these things if you</p>
<p>have a sensitivity in your stomach if</p>
<p>your stomach is raw if there&rsquo;s a ulcer</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s gastritis you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to do regular wheatgrass juice powder or</p>
<p>chlorophyll to help heal that over time</p>
<p>with a lot of vitamin C and preferably</p>
<p>from the food so you do you know a lot</p>
<p>of bell peppers a lot of greens and</p>
<p>things like that so that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>that will actually eventually heal heal</p>
<p>it but I think to close that valve that</p>
<p>valve most of the valves in your</p>
<p>digestive system are controlled by</p>
<p>something called the autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system and to actually help that you may</p>
<p>need something called benfotiamine in</p>
<p>higher amounts that&rsquo;s the type of B</p>
<p>vitamin that&rsquo;s in a fat Seibel and take</p>
<p>higher amounts of that because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good to support the neurology</p>
<p>from damage from insulin resistance and</p>
<p>things like that so it&rsquo;ll help the</p>
<p>nerves it helps</p>
<p>something called the diet diabetic</p>
<p>neuropathy</p>
<p>and problems with the autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system so I think that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>your best bet that been thought to mean</p>
<p>in higher amounts and then the other</p>
<p>thing is to start kind of focusing on</p>
<p>more probiotics and stuff to start</p>
<p>working on the smaller intestine okay</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re just gonna have to give</p>
<p>it some time in a pinch even though I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to do a lot of this do a</p>
<p>little bit of maybe some baking soda if</p>
<p>you really need to do something but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that option but as a as a way</p>
<p>to get some relief and temporarily just</p>
<p>do small amounts here and there all</p>
<p>right thanks Derek all right we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go to Ruth from Texas you had a question</p>
<p>go ahead Ruth oh good morning doctor</p>
<p>very good morning Karen hi I am loving</p>
<p>all of your supplements and I just kind</p>
<p>of fool around with them a little bit to</p>
<p>tweak them to make them work for me and</p>
<p>the sleep aid was one of those that I</p>
<p>tried and for some reason it gave me</p>
<p>this strange wakeful sleep so I used to</p>
<p>return policy sent it back and had them</p>
<p>send me the vegan one and it works</p>
<p>wonderfully and it puts me right to</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>the problem is is at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning it&rsquo;s like someone tapped me on</p>
<p>the shoulder and I&rsquo;m awake and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wide awake</p>
<p>feel that if I try and roll over and go</p>
<p>to sleep sometimes I can but otherwise I</p>
<p>have to get up and read or watch TV for</p>
<p>about an hour and then I can go back to</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>now you had a video on this and I have</p>
<p>searched high and low for it but I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find it I think you said it had</p>
<p>something to do with the adrenals and</p>
<p>cortisol but I can&rsquo;t remember yeah well</p>
<p>let me just talk about that did by the</p>
<p>way do you have this tool oh that yes</p>
<p>yes and I used that before I go to bed</p>
<p>at night okay I do good so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>talk about this after a second with them</p>
<p>do you have these rhythms of hormones</p>
<p>that kind of come out</p>
<p>and down and there&rsquo;s a there definitely</p>
<p>a pattern with a lot of adrenal cases</p>
<p>that tend to get up at 2 and 3 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>right right when you&rsquo;re supposed to have</p>
<p>the most deep rejuvenating sleep that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like the most awake you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like okay I&rsquo;m ready to go right I had</p>
<p>that problem so that that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>indication of adrenal totally adrenal as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing this tool a massage tool on</p>
<p>your body before you go to bed I would</p>
<p>spend a lot of work on the adrenal</p>
<p>points on the left and right of your</p>
<p>abdomen and really work those out</p>
<p>hardcore and also the back points which</p>
<p>is called the sympathetic so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>flight-or-fight that&rsquo;ll just really help</p>
<p>you a lot but it is an adrenal issue the</p>
<p>other thing that you can do for the</p>
<p>adrenal as well is take a little bit of</p>
<p>calcium before bed</p>
<p>I recommend calcium or at 8 calcium or</p>
<p>at 8 if you can find a calcium magnesium</p>
<p>orientate that would be the ideal scene</p>
<p>but you may need a little bit of calcium</p>
<p>right before bed and boom that should</p>
<p>give you some relief because calcium</p>
<p>does support the it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>sympathetics in the nervous system so I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s really all you need to do</p>
<p>right now and that should kind of put</p>
<p>the icing on the cake I&rsquo;m sorry that</p>
<p>should just like solve that little</p>
<p>problem you know you&rsquo;re doing better it</p>
<p>might kind of you need a little bit of</p>
<p>assistance okay Ruth thanks for your</p>
<p>call I appreciate that</p>
<p>all right Karen hey hi I&rsquo;m not gonna lie</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a little trouble with</p>
<p>facebook because there&rsquo;s some Adobe</p>
<p>Flash Player that&rsquo;s not downloading on</p>
<p>my mobile device and there&rsquo;s some change</p>
<p>there so if the guys can&rsquo;t come out and</p>
<p>fix this I have YouTube only that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>waiver that&rsquo;s my disclaimer but first</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s important I want to say</p>
<p>hello to people from Mexico</p>
<p>Kenya England Tampa Florida Tennessee</p>
<p>Nashville Oh is still Tennessee Taiwan</p>
<p>all over the place you guys good morning</p>
<p>okay good so I had an interesting</p>
<p>here somebody&rsquo;s asking can you use the</p>
<p>trace minerals liquid to put into</p>
<p>distilled water and would that make the</p>
<p>difference or what yeah yeah you</p>
<p>absolutely could put that in the water I</p>
<p>think the challenge with distilled water</p>
<p>as it has no mineral so it creates a</p>
<p>vacuum and it starts to pull it can pull</p>
<p>heavy metals and minerals from your own</p>
<p>system and you know you got to really</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re doing when you do</p>
<p>distilled water especially in large</p>
<p>quantities and also for a period of time</p>
<p>because it can deplete you of your</p>
<p>minerals so I think putting trace</p>
<p>minerals would be a nice solution to</p>
<p>that I think that&rsquo;s a great idea</p>
<p>actually okay good</p>
<p>yeah okay good so I&rsquo;m up and running</p>
<p>with both both apps now okay so let me</p>
<p>go over here if you can</p>
<p>Oh Scotland awesome I want to go</p>
<p>Scotland okay okay okay so I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>all over the place just getting oriented</p>
<p>I know you forgive me back to the phones</p>
<p>okay okay so Raj you&rsquo;re from North</p>
<p>Carolina you had a question about your</p>
<p>getting coldness in your extremities yes</p>
<p>I can hear you now yes yeah hello Karen</p>
<p>it was good to see you again</p>
<p>hi thank you Bert</p>
<p>dr. Berg the last time I spoke with you</p>
<p>about the heart rate the zinc the</p>
<p>vitamin b-complex that I&rsquo;m taking and</p>
<p>that did help me lower the heart rate</p>
<p>resting heart rate higher than 22 98 in</p>
<p>the morning too but I also added</p>
<p>melatonin the night before and that</p>
<p>again dropped it down to 80 which is my</p>
<p>regular so I want to really thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking the bed of our blockers</p>
<p>anymore so I really appreciate that</p>
<p>Frank um my question is I have whenever</p>
<p>I break my past I have a really coldness</p>
<p>in my fingers to the extent it kind of</p>
<p>pains the more I eat the more pain</p>
<p>and so we had a had a urine test done</p>
<p>and they found benzene in it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if benzene would cause that but so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking bentonite clay to get rid of</p>
<p>the benzene my benzene levels are full</p>
<p>point three that&rsquo;s full times higher</p>
<p>than you know point five zero which is a</p>
<p>little Q ll o Q units I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>that means so I was hoping you could</p>
<p>give me some tips on how to maybe get</p>
<p>rid of the benzene in my blood maybe I</p>
<p>mean I have also called this in my</p>
<p>kneecaps</p>
<p>as the allness of the kneecaps and the</p>
<p>fingertips is connected is it connected</p>
<p>to benzene but this only happens when I</p>
<p>eat but after about an hour or so the</p>
<p>coldness and the pain in the fingertips</p>
<p>goes away okay yeah I hate that when</p>
<p>that happens with that darn benzene in</p>
<p>the urine it just it&rsquo;s just you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very unusual thing but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously I don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>data to tell you about where that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming from but I would definitely</p>
<p>research it it&rsquo;s obviously there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re consuming or doing</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the chain smoking I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know but I&rsquo;m just kidding but what</p>
<p>happens is benzene is this is a poison</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously in your body somehow you</p>
<p>got to clean that out so first of all</p>
<p>find out what you&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>in your body but there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>bentonite clay is is the type of clay</p>
<p>that works through not absorption</p>
<p>absorption so it kind of lets things</p>
<p>cling on the outside electrically to</p>
<p>this particle so you can pull 2,000</p>
<p>times the weight of that particle out of</p>
<p>the body so it&rsquo;s a great detox but you</p>
<p>got to take it on an empty stomach and</p>
<p>that should clean up your system I would</p>
<p>do completely organic foods make sure</p>
<p>everything is like really clean without</p>
<p>any pesticides and start doing that and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one more thing a charcoal is</p>
<p>another great detoxifier that won&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>you feel sick but I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>messing up your temperature and your</p>
<p>coldness but if it&rsquo;s if it doesn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>away when you find the source of that</p>
<p>and eliminate that you need some iodine</p>
<p>okay because the reason you have the</p>
<p>pulse rate I think is because I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a mineral deficient so I then is</p>
<p>another mineral that can then make you</p>
<p>cold especially if you&rsquo;re doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting so I would start beefing</p>
<p>up the minerals and see if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help you and then let me know how you do</p>
<p>with that benzene dope I mean let me</p>
<p>know what you find that you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>exposed to because sometimes you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>like wow I didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not supposed</p>
<p>to be eating that and it&rsquo;s full with</p>
<p>benzene you know so like I&rsquo;d have no</p>
<p>data but it&rsquo;d be interesting to find out</p>
<p>thanks Raj all right so Karen hi Beth</p>
<p>did we get some questions oh we did we</p>
<p>have some stuff going here all right</p>
<p>so Robert on Facebook asks about Keo and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting if you have a</p>
<p>history of blood clots okay so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing I did a video on this when you</p>
<p>have clotting and you can have your</p>
<p>predisposed to clotting if you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance so insulin and high</p>
<p>insulin and insulin resistance and high</p>
<p>blood sugar will increase the risk of</p>
<p>getting clots so the opposite of that</p>
<p>scenario is ketone and fasting which</p>
<p>will bring down those clotting factors</p>
<p>and that will actually help you so keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting is the exact</p>
<p>thing to do to decrease the risk for</p>
<p>clotting okay hands down and also</p>
<p>someone asked about should I do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting and keto if I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>diabetic or if I&rsquo;m a pre-diabetic I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like have you been watching my videos</p>
<p>right the answer is the big fat yes you</p>
<p>need to do that watch the videos go on</p>
<p>the website and want do the free courses</p>
<p>the starter courses this is key if you</p>
<p>guys are new that&rsquo;s what you have to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll really get you started but I</p>
<p>have another question yeah how would a</p>
<p>polite or vinegar affect getting into</p>
<p>ketosis or help with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting or will it break a fast right</p>
<p>well it won&rsquo;t break a fast</p>
<p>it improves insulin resistance which</p>
<p>will help you lower your insulin help</p>
<p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s and help you get into</p>
<p>ketosis a lot better it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>great things about it in fact it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>your hunger improve reduce your hunger</p>
<p>it improves a you know diabetic symptoms</p>
<p>so yeah it&rsquo;s gonna help you will not</p>
<p>break the fast at all some people have</p>
<p>irritable stomachs or inflammation or an</p>
<p>ulcer so you&rsquo;d have to have it with the</p>
<p>meal but other than that I would</p>
<p>definitely not worry about that breaking</p>
<p>the past okay good and then if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink it you can do the digest right</p>
<p>yeah do something called digest formula</p>
<p>it has a powdered upset of vinegar</p>
<p>quite a bit with another thing called</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride which is the</p>
<p>natural thing to build up your</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid which so many people</p>
<p>have a problem with they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough stomach acid and so they can</p>
<p>enjoy the minerals we can&rsquo;t break down</p>
<p>proteins they can&rsquo;t kill the microbes</p>
<p>going in so they get all sorts of</p>
<p>digestive issues that sounds awful you</p>
<p>like that answer okay I have another</p>
<p>question yeah okay good what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thought on diatomaceous earth and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to explain what that is to some</p>
<p>people but does it have any effect on</p>
<p>ketosis or any manifest great to kill</p>
<p>ants and bugs and all sorts of things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s friendly in your</p>
<p>body it won&rsquo;t affect your body and it</p>
<p>has various properties you know related</p>
<p>to countering toxins and also improving</p>
<p>your immune system and killing off</p>
<p>microbes in your body you know I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great thing I just haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>enough research to see if it creates a</p>
<p>really big effect other people swear by</p>
<p>it I did try it yeah did you notice any</p>
<p>change didn&rsquo;t mean that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not bad we tried it and we give it</p>
<p>to Charlie yeah I give it to Charlie</p>
<p>almost every day that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>son Charlie that&rsquo;s our dog you guys know</p>
<p>we we need to bring Charlie here Charlie</p>
<p>has become a vegan he likes he likes</p>
<p>vegetables if I start cutting some bell</p>
<p>peppers he&rsquo;s like sitting right there</p>
<p>like waiting like give me that Bell know</p>
<p>what about what about that bag of</p>
<p>carrots the other day</p>
<p>so we have a guy fixing the he&rsquo;s fixing</p>
<p>your house and he and he has brought</p>
<p>these are carrots knows his carrots he</p>
<p>grabbed the bag and I think I sent a</p>
<p>video on Instagram you start growling he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t let us ate that whole bag so</p>
<p>you know what I think we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>switch into a vegan diet no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>but okay we digress hey guys so listen I</p>
<p>got a really cool download this is</p>
<p>called the keto adaptation remedy card</p>
<p>you can download it there&rsquo;s a link down</p>
<p>below and what this is all about you cut</p>
<p>out this thing and you keep it in your</p>
<p>wallet</p>

<p>only thing I love the green it just</p>
<p>rained a little too much so I had to dry</p>
<p>out and I move to California really</p>
<p>thank goodness</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s right met her you know right</p>
<p>that the wife you know the triglycerides</p>
<p>are blood flats blood fats and that is</p>
<p>the the first thing to drop if your</p>
<p>triglycerides are high we know your</p>
<p>carbs are high you get on the ketone in</p>
<p>fasting and that thing comes right down</p>
<p>to normal and it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>indication of what&rsquo;s going on with your</p>
<p>your sugars our bodies just weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>designed to you know consume that much</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s not coming from eating fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sugar okay so now we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go to host son Deena</p>
<p>from New York City go ahead you two</p>
<p>question good morning dr. bird boy and</p>
<p>welcome back KarenT thank you i I have a</p>
<p>question about weight I recently did my</p>
<p>annual test and I my vitamin b3 came</p>
<p>back at 22 and GML my vitamin b12 is 383</p>
<p>pg/ml and my insulin is 4.5 4.5 mu L</p>
<p>okay do I need to is</p>
<p>that within the normal range or do you</p>
<p>suggest that I purchase any of your</p>
<p>product well here&rsquo;s a question did they</p>
<p>do a post meal insulin test or just a</p>
<p>passing insulin test they only did a</p>
<p>fasting yeah so that&rsquo;s really we want to</p>
<p>see the post meal we want to see the</p>
<p>fasting in the post meal because we want</p>
<p>to see what happens after you eat in the</p>
<p>reaction to insulin Co hayek those how</p>
<p>fast it comes down you saw okay here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things before you go the</p>
<p>supplement route I recommend you get the</p>
<p>basics in a healthy ketosis I think one</p>
<p>of the best books to start is this one</p>
<p>right here it&rsquo;s called it&rsquo;s not lose</p>
<p>weight to get healthy it&rsquo;s gonna help</p>
<p>you lose weight</p>
<p>why because you can read it in 45</p>
<p>minutes it has a bunch of pictures in it</p>
<p>it shows you meals exactly what to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple but it shows you exactly why</p>
<p>it works and then you fill in the blanks</p>
<p>with this right here and then you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s two main supplements</p>
<p>that I do recommend for people in</p>
<p>general is the nutritional yeast tablets</p>
<p>because it has all the natural B&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you knew this but most B</p>
<p>vitamins sold are synthetic and</p>
<p>eighty-five percent of all the B B</p>
<p>vitamins in the world are sold through</p>
<p>China so and it&rsquo;s synthetic and at cost</p>
<p>of like just pennies it&rsquo;s so cheap when</p>
<p>you get synthetic and my whole viewpoint</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not the same as food based so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I like the nutritional yeast</p>
<p>and the tablets and then the</p>
<p>electrolytes because I I designed it so</p>
<p>it has a lot of potassium and magnesium</p>
<p>in a Scituate form with the trace</p>
<p>minerals and no sugar so you those two</p>
<p>seem to work really good as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adapting into the keto so you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any other symptoms and issues because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard sometimes for people to</p>
<p>get the potassium they need because they</p>
<p>they just are not used to consuming 25</p>
<p>cups of salad three times a day so you</p>
<p>only really need 7 to 10 but for some</p>
<p>people they need a little bit more now</p>
<p>so yeah I really needed the post insulin</p>
<p>test but and then the b12 deficiency</p>
<p>you have I would recommend getting that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a vegan it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>tough you&rsquo;d be so you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>get as a supplement make sure you get</p>
<p>the natural form that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>methylcobalamin not the cyano Cibola</p>
<p>mine version and if you&rsquo;re not a vegan</p>
<p>just from some organic grass-fed meat</p>
<p>you can get enough b12 easily if that</p>
<p>still doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>then you know that you might need to</p>
<p>work on your stomach acids you need to</p>
<p>acidify your stomach with the digestive</p>
<p>formula and then you&rsquo;ll be fine okay</p>
<p>thank you so much for your call all</p>
<p>right Karen okay good what do we got</p>
<p>well there are a number of questions</p>
<p>revolving around constipation dry skin</p>
<p>dry mucous lining things like that while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so I glommed them all together and over</p>
<p>to you okay so constipation if</p>
<p>constipation is new on the in the</p>
<p>fasting or or keto realize that when you</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting and you go for</p>
<p>my six meals down to one meal you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to have the same frequency or the</p>
<p>volume of of waste coming out of your</p>
<p>body so you&rsquo;re not going to have to go</p>
<p>to the bathroom the same amount because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating the mass amount of</p>
<p>food okay so that might be something</p>
<p>like oh okay I didn&rsquo;t realize that so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to go three times a day maybe</p>
<p>you know less than that secondly if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot of vegetables and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not used to it</p>
<p>that can bind you up because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the micro microbes to be able to</p>
<p>handle all that fermentation of all the</p>
<p>fibers in which case you have to steam</p>
<p>the vegetables have a little less like</p>
<p>zucchini is good cauliflower broccoli</p>
<p>things like that maybe a little</p>
<p>fermented vegetables and maybe not the</p>
<p>volume that I consume until you can get</p>
<p>used to it because that because those</p>
<p>soluble fibers that are supposed to be</p>
<p>eaten by the microbes they retain fluid</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve got this</p>
<p>this fluid thing talking about me again</p>
<p>behind your back that&rsquo;s good necessarily</p>
<p>you just had this conversation yesterday</p>
<p>because I love arugula and I love a big</p>
<p>bowl and then sometimes I&rsquo;m hungry for a</p>
<p>second Bowl but initially I would just</p>
<p>get completely blow</p>
<p>with bubbles and things like that I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t handle it and it was depressing</p>
<p>but you know I worked my way up but</p>
<p>definitely zucchini cauliflower things</p>
<p>like that are a lot easier especially as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re kind of going into this</p>
<p>instead of like jumping in it just has</p>
<p>to do with the microbes that are not</p>
<p>there yet so you have to build up to</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m growing my my crops yeah grow</p>
<p>your microbes now the next question you</p>
<p>said about dry skin right yeah and nose</p>
<p>lining just dry in general yeah um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really has to do with the healthy</p>
<p>fatty acids that you need to maybe look</p>
<p>at because when you&rsquo;re doing keto maybe</p>
<p>you need to have some balance of</p>
<p>additional fatty acids like borage oil</p>
<p>or maybe even flax oil things like that</p>
<p>or even some good high-quality krill or</p>
<p>fish oil to get those fatty acids in the</p>
<p>body so the skin is not so dried out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the main thing now if your</p>
<p>gallbladder is an issue that could be</p>
<p>another reason why you&rsquo;re not absorbing</p>
<p>those fatty acids alright what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny why did the chef quit why did the</p>
<p>chef quit yeah what do you mean why did</p>
<p>the chef quit it&rsquo;s a joke oh why does</p>
<p>just I have no clue because they cut his</p>
<p>celery this is the stop this is I know I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know that was adorable thank you</p>
<p>yeah okay</p>
<p>okay good so thank you for that question</p>
<p>yeah and so let&rsquo;s go right to Lucy okay</p>
<p>on that note let&rsquo;s go to Lucy from Los</p>
<p>Angeles you had a question don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>Lucy good morning dr. burr thank you for</p>
<p>taking my call I was so excited to be</p>
<p>able to be able to air with you but</p>
<p>anyhow first I want to thank you for all</p>
<p>you do it was amazing I am so glad I</p>
<p>found you but let me give you a little</p>
<p>background oh by myself I am a 40 year</p>
<p>old</p>
<p>agents I&rsquo;m five feet tall and I have my</p>
<p>kidney transplant four years ago due to</p>
<p>the polycystic kidney disease and three</p>
<p>years ago I have both of my disease</p>
<p>kidney removed I am doing well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>currently taking portals genetics for</p>
<p>generic for the program and also in</p>
<p>ticket beer and I&rsquo;m also taking a</p>
<p>multivitamin women&rsquo;s multivitamins were</p>
<p>highly complex and the high potency</p>
<p>time-release capsule would omega-3 fish</p>
<p>oil on a daily basis so I have been on</p>
<p>is for three months and then luckily I</p>
<p>found you so I start doing the keto and</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m on keto and in a minute fasting</p>
<p>for eight days now</p>
<p>not feeling hungry at all no craving I</p>
<p>have three meals a day I have been</p>
<p>eating ten cups of vegetable or salad</p>
<p>per day anyway oh my yeah Michael is to</p>
<p>lose my belly fat and be healthy and</p>
<p>have more energy I am a adrenal body</p>
<p>type I took your test and I brought you</p>
<p>a book and I have been watching and</p>
<p>following your informative video for</p>
<p>some times now I have two questions for</p>
<p>you first question is as a kidney</p>
<p>transplantation is Kido and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting say for me to continue as a</p>
<p>lifestyle</p>
<p>even after I reach my goal my first</p>
<p>questions my second question is I do lab</p>
<p>work often on on the regular basis in</p>
<p>order for my doctor and I started</p>
<p>healing immediate fasting and my doctor</p>
<p>told me my urine is very siddik saw my</p>
<p>keto diet or hints that ketones</p>
<p>that would cause kind of false positive</p>
<p>on the urine protein and Bluffs on the</p>
<p>dis dipstick is that something I need to</p>
<p>worry about you know that you remember</p>
<p>the pH of the year uh you know what I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t was it below fire cover with me</p>
<p>was it below fire uh I&rsquo;m not sure I have</p>
<p>to double check on that okay yeah so and</p>
<p>and I try to purchase your adrenal kit</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>I cannot take any of those supplement</p>
<p>and said sleepy aged late so is there</p>
<p>anything haha I don&rsquo;t like my Keaney</p>
<p>Dodgers oh no I yeah so is there</p>
<p>anything you can recommend or because I</p>
<p>understand the I understand the</p>
<p>employment of the cortisol in or Drina</p>
<p>gland and I also understand of gall</p>
<p>bladder tissue because I watch your</p>
<p>video is there anything that you can</p>
<p>recommend for me to walk away around it</p>
<p>I mean I purchase your the the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder it was fabulous</p>
<p>and so so so so those are my questions</p>
<p>okay got it alright so let&rsquo;s just take</p>
<p>it from the top okay so you had the</p>
<p>kidney you have a you&rsquo;re in a transplant</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on an anti-rejection drug which</p>
<p>is cortisone or cortisone prednisone or</p>
<p>a version of cortisol now so what you</p>
<p>have to do is you have to really just</p>
<p>work on damage control because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to take that because your</p>
<p>body tends to attack and try to get rid</p>
<p>of that so here&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called colostrum you needed to</p>
<p>start taking colostrum a very small</p>
<p>amount before you go to bed over a long</p>
<p>period of time that that tends to really</p>
<p>keep your immune system really high</p>
<p>and it kind of repair some of the damage</p>
<p>from the prednisone which really kind of</p>
<p>messes everything up the only really</p>
<p>supplement that you shouldn&rsquo;t take that</p>
<p>I have is the advanced or the adrenal</p>
<p>fatigue formula that&rsquo;s the only one you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take I mean no the other ones are</p>
<p>fine they&rsquo;re not going to be a problem</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to interfere with your</p>
<p>cortisol but I think the seek help would</p>
<p>be important the wheatgrass juice would</p>
<p>be important and probably even the</p>
<p>cruciferous food because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually start cleaning the liver and</p>
<p>the kidney you&rsquo;re doing the exact right</p>
<p>thing with the ketone and then fasting</p>
<p>to help your kidneys survive because</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s going to do for the immune</p>
<p>system when you get in the toffee and</p>
<p>start cleaning up all them old</p>
<p>stuff and repairing the the selves and</p>
<p>keeping your insulin regulated which by</p>
<p>the way is one of the biggest problems</p>
<p>with the kidney is the high insulin so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the exact thing to protect</p>
<p>the kidney the new kidney that you have</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;re right on track with</p>
<p>that and you did mention you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>high potency something just make sure</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t take some tonic vitamins so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of the high potency has</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins but as far as the</p>
<p>acidic urine goes you know why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>get some bottled high quality water from</p>
<p>a spring that has a high pH to kind of</p>
<p>counter that and maybe take some take</p>
<p>some little electrolyte mix that I have</p>
<p>which is very alkaline to kind of chill</p>
<p>it out because when you go through a</p>
<p>tough in a minute fasting your pH will</p>
<p>become slightly more acidic and you know</p>
<p>maybe a problem may not but if it&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still fine because that&rsquo;s within</p>
<p>the normal range but if it drops down</p>
<p>the four well that&rsquo;s a problem so you</p>
<p>might need to alkalize your body with</p>
<p>more more vegetables or more alkaline</p>
<p>minerals okay but really good questions</p>
<p>thanks Lucy alright Karen I turn yeah</p>
<p>you turn okay good</p>
<p>so Cindy on facebook is asking about leg</p>
<p>cramps she&rsquo;s doing keto and she got leg</p>
<p>cramps I think you know something about</p>
<p>leg cramps oh I wonder if I have she</p>
<p>done that I wonder if it&rsquo;s a cheat sheet</p>
<p>on there there chichi yes there is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a keto adaptation remedy card you</p>
<p>can download there&rsquo;s a link down below</p>
<p>yes yeah and you need potassium and in</p>
<p>some cases even some calcium how would</p>
<p>she know the difference I would say the</p>
<p>most common was the potassium one</p>
<p>because when you do intimate fasting in</p>
<p>ketosis like your body sucks a lot of</p>
<p>that potassium so that&rsquo;s like the first</p>
<p>one that you I would try and that should</p>
<p>Hamlet but if it doesn&rsquo;t you got to back</p>
<p>up and to get potassium that&rsquo;s leafy</p>
<p>greens but also the electrolyte formula</p>
<p>is loaded yeah a thousand I drink that</p>
<p>stuff every day her yeah per serving</p>
<p>size serving okay good another hormone</p>
<p>replacement what are your thoughts in 30</p>
<p>seconds realize</p>
<p>well I always like to recommend to</p>
<p>support the gland that makes the hormone</p>
<p>versus jump to start adding hormones</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m not telling you not to take</p>
<p>any drugs or anything like that I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that when you take hormone</p>
<p>replacement it comes with a package</p>
<p>cause your own glands to not have to</p>
<p>produce so the question is why do you</p>
<p>normal replacement in the first place</p>
<p>what hormone are you trying to replace</p>
<p>what which one is down if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>growth hormone well it&rsquo;s here here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s anti aging you can do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting that&rsquo;ll spike it like crazy</p>
<p>doing exercise specially sprinting and</p>
<p>going on a low-carb diet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll just like bring hormones back up</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re low in testosterone just lower</p>
<p>your insulin and it&rsquo;ll come right back</p>
<p>up so again I&rsquo;m not crazy about jumping</p>
<p>right into it but I have a lot of videos</p>
<p>on on what you should do with you know</p>
<p>your hormones depending on what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to increase so just search out</p>
<p>the videos in estrogen at this if you</p>
<p>want to increase more estrogen boron is</p>
<p>the mineral that you need to take no</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not the boron story no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna</p>
<p>maybe later people we have a really good</p>
<p>boron story in the future so watch every</p>
<p>week maybe yeah and by the way abide by</p>
<p>the bed by the way by the bar by the Y</p>
<p>after this show I&rsquo;m gonna be doing a I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do another Q a live with everyone</p>
<p>on the membership side and also the keto</p>
<p>coach program I just released all those</p>
<p>guys - I have a whole course which is</p>
<p>awesome if you want to be a keto coach</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting coach boom you</p>
<p>need to do that course it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible and then after that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do alive with all the Facebook lab</p>
<p>people people so stay tuned for that</p>
<p>hello brat that&rsquo;s coming right up okay</p>
<p>opportunity you didn&rsquo;t say that I think</p>
<p>they would appreciate me calling a lab</p>
<p>rat an experiment it&rsquo;s a human no not an</p>
<p>experiment</p>
<p>okay anyway move along from that</p>
<p>but I wanted to bring something up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a question but I think people are</p>
<p>trying to solve this with the concept of</p>
<p>plateauing when they&rsquo;re on keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because I myself</p>
<p>had this happen and I came to a</p>
<p>realization and also with the creation</p>
<p>of this new app macros app that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>created which is not out yet it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>just coming but my point is there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a lot of realizations on how much fat is</p>
<p>enough fat or too much fat on keto</p>
<p>because I myself had the misconception</p>
<p>and misunderstanding about that I</p>
<p>thought it was you know high fat then a</p>
<p>little bit of protein and really super</p>
<p>low carbs or no carbs so I felt quite</p>
<p>free in fat consumption and I had a</p>
<p>realization dr. Burke oh you did I did</p>
<p>what was that then I was just eating too</p>
<p>much fat Wow and you know the teaspoons</p>
<p>the nut butter or the extra keto bombs</p>
<p>and things like that were actually</p>
<p>preventing me from losing the weight</p>
<p>that I wanted to lose so I cut that out</p>
<p>another seven pounds gone right so and</p>
<p>this is after yeah I was I was working</p>
<p>out and I was building muscle and I was</p>
<p>shrinking in size which was great but it</p>
<p>was handling that fat intake yeah and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple points about that I</p>
<p>want to chime in</p>
<p>number one you might be an in ketosis</p>
<p>but the ketones that you&rsquo;re burning are</p>
<p>the dietary fat not your own fat reserve</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s number one number two when</p>
<p>we say ketones ketosis is a high-fat</p>
<p>diet because it&rsquo;s 75% of the total</p>
<p>calories you really got to understand</p>
<p>that one gram of fat has more than</p>
<p>double the calories of carbs in protein</p>
<p>so that 70 is really kind of like</p>
<p>misleading and especially if your</p>
<p>metabolism is 70 what was 70% of the</p>
<p>total calories on that pie chart</p>
<p>that is in this book Karen that I need</p>
<p>to get you to read that one of these</p>
<p>days here I know I was saying that for</p>
<p>the benefit of the viewers okay</p>
<p>certainly I knew yeah this thing right</p>
<p>here see this Karen right there can you</p>
<p>see that you&rsquo;re in another room as far</p>
<p>as anyone elses okay so see that that</p>
<p>big blue thing right here in my mind&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eye I see yes look look 70% is God so</p>
<p>that uh that seems like oh my gosh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a - well really can you can eat up that</p>
<p>that fat that fat limit really fast</p>
<p>night if you&rsquo;re 18 years old maybe fast</p>
<p>metabolism or you&rsquo;re not trying to lose</p>
<p>weight you know what you can go up with</p>
<p>the fat you can go up with the fat we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna release an app it&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>a lot of people and but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little hard it&rsquo;s a little bit difficult</p>
<p>to put people into this one bucket</p>
<p>because you have intimate fasting you</p>
<p>got one meal to meal three meals then</p>
<p>you have a person&rsquo;s ability to digest</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>their metabolism their age their height</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of little factors</p>
<p>here so trying to make it just simple so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like counting calories but</p>
<p>you do have some guidelines okay with</p>
<p>that said I&rsquo;m gonna go right to</p>
<p>Christina from Texas she&rsquo;s been waiting</p>
<p>for 36 minutes and 13 seconds go ahead</p>
<p>Christina thank you for taking my call</p>
<p>doctor</p>
<p>sure um I&rsquo;m 49 I have ehlers-danlos</p>
<p>syndrome syndrome ehlers-danlos syndrome</p>
<p>type classic type ones the connective</p>
<p>tissue disorder okay</p>
<p>collagen defective collagen okay I also</p>
<p>have nap cell activation disorder and I</p>
<p>have a mild form of congenital adrenal</p>
<p>hyperplasia 11 beta hydroxylase</p>
<p>deficiency you know I was diagnosed with</p>
<p>that for my two of my children went</p>
<p>through precocious puberty and I myself</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t require treatment I think</p>
<p>my eleven deoxy cortisol was maybe like</p>
<p>ninety or something I wasn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>super elevated but I</p>
<p>you have a adrenal issue and I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>really severe inflammation so past few</p>
<p>years and I kind of attributed to to all</p>
<p>of those disorders and about four weeks</p>
<p>ago I came across one of your videos and</p>
<p>I realized that I was insulin resistant</p>
<p>I immediately started the keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 33 pounds Wow right</p>
<p>practically gone I feel amazing but two</p>
<p>weeks ago I went to the neurologist</p>
<p>because I do have a small brain aneurysm</p>
<p>was three millimeters and now it is four</p>
<p>by two millimeter and by lobed and I</p>
<p>think it probably grew because of the</p>
<p>inflammation it was so severe and they</p>
<p>were doing stuff like that I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>wondering if there&rsquo;s anything I can do</p>
<p>to maybe stabilize it or you know I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know possibly reverse those things</p>
<p>good question one question I have for</p>
<p>you do you did your inflammation go down</p>
<p>when you started this yeah like good</p>
<p>burst nation away it was crazy</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s awesome okay so here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple of things and aneurism is the</p>
<p>weakness within the the wall of the</p>
<p>vessel the blood vessel okay so we have</p>
<p>this bulging of the it&rsquo;s a connective</p>
<p>tissue you have a connective tissue</p>
<p>disorder there&rsquo;s things that you can do</p>
<p>to at least improve it and one thing is</p>
<p>a lot of these the lining on the on the</p>
<p>walls are disrupted and destroyed yes</p>
<p>genetically but also from insulin</p>
<p>resistance so there there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things that protect the arteries against</p>
<p>the damage from high sugar and high</p>
<p>insulin and that would bottom b1 and</p>
<p>vitamin C so if you can go up with your</p>
<p>vitamin C foods a lot of leafy greens</p>
<p>about peppers different peppers so keep</p>
<p>your vitamin C really really high</p>
<p>because vitamin C is essential for</p>
<p>collagen stability and also take the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast in higher amounts</p>
<p>those two will actually kind of protect</p>
<p>the arteries from damage</p>
<p>and strengthen the wall of the artery</p>
<p>the other thing is that because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on keto and in fasting you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>lower your risk for clotting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number that&rsquo;s a good one and then</p>
<p>in a minute fasting really help it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>anti-aging secret it&rsquo;ll help the</p>
<p>proteins</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help strengthen your proteins</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll make your arteries more elastic</p>
<p>it makes your arteries younger I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be the biggest tool for</p>
<p>you is in a minute of fasting so if you</p>
<p>can get to a point where you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>one once a day I think it&rsquo;s gonna really</p>
<p>help you a lot with your aneurysms okay</p>
<p>thanks Christina all right Karen oh you</p>
<p>know what Karen what I forgot to ask the</p>
<p>questions I have three questions yeah so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the first question okay what is</p>
<p>the absolute best healthiest snack when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing in a minute fasting okay so</p>
<p>go ahead and answer the question here go</p>
<p>ahead answer this right now and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna we&rsquo;re gonna look at that after and</p>
<p>I have another question one very patient</p>
<p>gal I&rsquo;m assuming here is asking this</p>
<p>question about keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting if you&rsquo;re trying to get pregnant</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re already pregnant and people</p>
<p>guess what</p>
<p>dr. Burke&rsquo;s gonna be a grandpa is that</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>oh yeah of course we&rsquo;re not gonna talk</p>
<p>about the fact that I&rsquo;m gonna be a</p>
<p>grandma yeah we won&rsquo;t talk about that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna talk about that yeah but</p>
<p>so this is a conversation in our home</p>
<p>right so keto and pregnancy it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>turn to talk now okay so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing when you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>pregnancy which I have a lot of</p>
<p>experience right and also giving birth</p>
<p>because I know how that could feel right</p>
<p>because one time I had a like a really</p>
<p>you know severe kidney stone a long time</p>
<p>ago now basically it&rsquo;s you need to do</p>
<p>keto healthy keto not regular</p>
<p>traditional keto but a healthy ketosis</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m talking about because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to provide all the all the</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>for this growing growing fetus and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna develop same thing with</p>
<p>breastfeeding okay that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing in a minute fasting I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t start doing a lot of</p>
<p>in a minute fasting when you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>pregnant or breastfeeding just because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s too many things that are</p>
<p>going on but I would definitely do a</p>
<p>mild version of in a minute fasting what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing three meals no snacks</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do and just make</p>
<p>sure those meals are really robust Karen</p>
<p>make sure that those meals are very</p>
<p>fortified with super healthy like the</p>
<p>eggs and organic respite meets all those</p>
<p>fats are gonna really help you the</p>
<p>challenge with most people most women</p>
<p>who are getting pregnant is the trace</p>
<p>mineral so I would highly recommend</p>
<p>getting a good plant-based trace</p>
<p>minerals so that baby comes out with was</p>
<p>really good teeth now when when you</p>
<p>deliver you really need a new breast</p>
<p>feed breast feeding that&rsquo;s an essential</p>
<p>thing because guess what you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>put that infant into ketosis breast</p>
<p>feeding is so much healthy fat that the</p>
<p>child goes right into Keita ketotic</p>
<p>state which is healthy so if you were</p>
<p>breastfed guess what you started out in</p>
<p>ketosis and then of course we go right</p>
<p>into glycolysis which is a sugar state</p>
<p>which is terrible but our bodies really</p>
<p>were meant to run on ketones so the</p>
<p>hardest thing to get when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant is the trace minerals and then</p>
<p>maybe you know the B vitamins so B</p>
<p>vitamins ah so you need the Brucie&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>can make cookies out of them keto</p>
<p>friendly cookies or nutritional yeast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost similar and you actually</p>
<p>have higher quality breast milk as well</p>
<p>when you do that okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll remember that just remember that</p>
<p>okay good now and by the way a lot of</p>
<p>people are saying congratulations okay</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s very nice thank you very much</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna let some people are</p>
<p>brilliant here answer just another</p>
<p>minute on the what snack is the best</p>
<p>snack but I have</p>
<p>another point we see a lot on the lab on</p>
<p>the dr. Berg keto Wyeth lab this concept</p>
<p>of dry fasting can you please address</p>
<p>this well here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>honestly I don&rsquo;t have a tremendously and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to our producer yeah</p>
<p>the thing with the thing I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of data I can&rsquo;t find a</p>
<p>lot of research on dry fasting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not a lot of data out there so for</p>
<p>that that being said I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>even comment on it because I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the guy to come to for an</p>
<p>opinion because I don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>experience in doing that so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forward it yeah I&rsquo;m not going to forward</p>
<p>it I&rsquo;m not gonna say not to do it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have enough data I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>only going to tell you what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced in and I just don&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have a comment on it because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have enough research into</p>
<p>that ok I have an opinion on it I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you do yeah you keep it to yourself ok</p>
<p>yeah how about some answers here you</p>
<p>ready yeah I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>ok there were just a couple of people</p>
<p>with suggestions like celery or an</p>
<p>avocado all really good foods pork rinds</p>
<p>mm-hmm but most people yeah are saying</p>
<p>well one guy said oxygen which I thought</p>
<p>was great ok no snacking nothing really</p>
<p>yes a lot of great sarcastic comments</p>
<p>about it being gluttonous to snack if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on keto and different things like</p>
<p>that these guys must have been listening</p>
<p>to you Wow okay do we have a drumroll</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>the answer is there is no healthy snack</p>
<p>yeah you guys are so I&rsquo;m like Hello yeah</p>
<p>because this is the problem snacking is</p>
<p>like oh my gosh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so bad you go</p>
<p>to the grocery store you got lines of</p>
<p>all the protein bars and the trail mixes</p>
<p>and that so-called healthy snacks the</p>
<p>jerky listen you&rsquo;re gonna increase</p>
<p>insulin if you do that so snacking is</p>
<p>very very very very very bad in fact if</p>
<p>you want to stay fat</p>
<p>just keep snacking even if it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>food the thing that I omitted from my my</p>
<p>diet which is basically all I did I took</p>
<p>out the apples and peanut butter and the</p>
<p>nuts at night and I went from 211 down</p>
<p>to 210 now 211 down to 185 and really</p>
<p>rapidly that was I just kept I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change anything else</p>
<p>so the snacking is the killer and but</p>
<p>our whole society is based on these</p>
<p>snacking I mean like it&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>eating eating eating to prevent hunger</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t over eat eating to</p>
<p>stimulate your metabolism this is all</p>
<p>bogus</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening now is the food</p>
<p>industry is really jumping on this and</p>
<p>just pushing the healthy snacks and</p>
<p>people are buying more it&rsquo;s gonna in</p>
<p>2020 Karen it&rsquo;s gonna be a six hundred</p>
<p>and thirty billion dollar business</p>
<p>healthy snacks so if you want to snack</p>
<p>just push it to the meal right okay end</p>
<p>a story and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>yeah all our recipes the ideas and to</p>
<p>have the tie in the middle of day right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to have a taste which Deborah just</p>
<p>asked when is cabbies coming so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna let you guys know that we are</p>
<p>actually doing another run we tweet some</p>
<p>things and we&rsquo;re doing another run now</p>
<p>in May yeah so stay tuned stay tuned I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited about yeah now Jason&rsquo;s been on</p>
<p>hold for 44 minutes and 14 seconds so</p>
<p>Jason you had a question you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Kansas City go ahead I don&rsquo;t actor Barry</p>
<p>thanks for having yeah sure my question</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m an extra key dough for eight</p>
<p>months</p>
<p>recently a little over a month ago I</p>
<p>started experimenting</p>
<p>Kito carnivore mm-hmm basically just</p>
<p>eating meat meat butter ghee pink</p>
<p>Himalayan salt or red nose real salt</p>
<p>pretty much all that I been eating and I</p>
<p>noticed it upside right away within a</p>
<p>couple days after eliminating a whole</p>
<p>vegetables from my diet my question is</p>
<p>can I get all the vitamins minerals and</p>
<p>nutrients I need by eating basically a</p>
<p>meat ketosis I&rsquo;ll type diet if I if I</p>
<p>use like organ meat once or twice a week</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to do a video on that and analyze that</p>
<p>but you I think it&rsquo;s possible I think</p>
<p>some people can do that but to get the</p>
<p>vitamins you&rsquo;re probably going to have</p>
<p>to consume some organ meats in there</p>
<p>because just the muscle does not have</p>
<p>near the nutrients like a liver or</p>
<p>kidney or brain so that&rsquo;s one thing but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trick there&rsquo;s actually more</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals and organ meat</p>
<p>than there is in vegetables now so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s new some people</p>
<p>are trying it I have not tried it myself</p>
<p>the other thing that would look at is</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re consuming when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually in ketosis and you&rsquo;re dumping</p>
<p>all this path of the liver sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to have some of</p>
<p>the fibrous type things to kind of flesh</p>
<p>out that fat so you don&rsquo;t end up with a</p>
<p>fatty liver the other point I want to</p>
<p>bring up is getting your phytonutrients</p>
<p>phytonutrients are the plant-based</p>
<p>nutrients those are like the additional</p>
<p>nutrients that don&rsquo;t really come from</p>
<p>meat and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re extra give</p>
<p>extra health benefits they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>essential but they&rsquo;re good for a lot of</p>
<p>things so if you feel better and you</p>
<p>monitor things and you probably list it</p>
<p>all the foods and try to analyze your</p>
<p>the requirements and if you can get your</p>
<p>requirements each day go for it and if</p>
<p>it helps you I just haven&rsquo;t had enough</p>
<p>experience yet it&rsquo;s a new thing so let</p>
<p>us know how you do</p>
<p>thanks Jason but then what about</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s Morgan me yeah you do have</p>
<p>potassium and organ meats and meat you</p>
<p>have like even from like six ounces</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get 300 milligrams hmm but the</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem the enzymes your body</p>
<p>can make enzymes and plus you can have</p>
<p>rare meat okay but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have it might be difficult</p>
<p>not to overdo it with the protein</p>
<p>because as soon as you start doing if</p>
<p>you start adding more and more protein</p>
<p>you can spike insulin and now we&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>a Atkins diet right so and that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>on the liver right it can be yeah</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing way too much and</p>
<p>because you you can only like break</p>
<p>absorb like 30 35 grams of protein per</p>
<p>sitting so if you do too much but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing you know some people can get</p>
<p>away with it some people can do it like</p>
<p>just when you think like wow this is</p>
<p>gonna really be bad all sudden they do</p>
<p>do better so it&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>experiment and see if you can pull it</p>
<p>off okay so now we need to I need to ask</p>
<p>you another question before I go to</p>
<p>Colleen okay okay</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s question number two guys</p>
<p>and what does it mean if you have cracks</p>
<p>in the corner of your mouth</p>
<p>what are you deficient in okay got a</p>
<p>little red crack what does that mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really painful yes okay so let us</p>
<p>know and then I&rsquo;m gonna go right to</p>
<p>Colleen Robin she&rsquo;s from Alberta Canada</p>
<p>go ahead Colleen good morning thanks for</p>
<p>taking my call and hello Aaron long time</p>
<p>no see hi hi I forgot to mention to your</p>
<p>rep who answered the phone that I just</p>
<p>had one other thing to ask and can I get</p>
<p>your electrolytes and you nutritional</p>
<p>yeast from Amazon because I can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>it but I found the raw wheat grass there</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m out of my you&rsquo;re not yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my empty bottle electrolyte and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got yeah I got nothing in my</p>
<p>vitamin B&rsquo;s so I mean it</p>
<p>get that off Amazon you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on going to Canada right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually as we speak we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>aggressively working on that because</p>
<p>they have a lot of clients from Canada</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Amazon goes to Canada</p>
<p>right now but yeah we got our</p>
<p>fulfillment dr. Burke comm the evidence</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s asked Amazon so your wheatgrass is</p>
<p>on Amazon because I saw it yeah I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if it ships to Canada that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only thing but but I&rsquo;ll dr. Berger calm</p>
<p>it down yeah I know yeah no problem</p>
<p>okay I would mention to you when I</p>
<p>talked to last a couple weeks ago that I</p>
<p>went off of the synthroid like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>refill it yeah after you know of it for</p>
<p>over a month my TSH is normal and he</p>
<p>wants me to have progressive recheck</p>
<p>every three months Wow Mike Flynn on</p>
<p>March 29th was sixty three point seven</p>
<p>according to the labs should be less</p>
<p>than 120 and that&rsquo;s so he said if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like if it&rsquo;s working for you yeah</p>
<p>stay on it well I&rsquo;m not doing great on</p>
<p>the weight because I&rsquo;m still like you</p>
<p>say if you diva if you do ten percent</p>
<p>you still benefit but I want to do a</p>
<p>hundred percent so I&rsquo;ll get to it</p>
<p>eventually</p>
<p>yeah oh no anyway does that sound like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not insulin resistant to fit sixty</p>
<p>three point seven</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going in the garand a</p>
<p>great direction I think you do it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>improving greatly</p>
<p>okay perfect now Karen and you what how</p>
<p>many carbohydrates are in that fabulous</p>
<p>bread that I make that you guys made on</p>
<p>YouTube if you just it&rsquo;s meant not to</p>
<p>have the whole loaf so if you have just</p>
<p>a little piece and then I think if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not mistaken we did list the carbs if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mistaken I&rsquo;ll double-check that</p>
<p>so you could find out the carbs yeah I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but keep in mind it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some nuts but then it&rsquo;s things like chia</p>
<p>and seeds and stuff like that so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not dealing with any kind of wheat so</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not right yeah okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perfect I think you&rsquo;ve answered</p>
<p>all my questions</p>
<p>great thanks Colleen thank you</p>

<p>stories okay alright that being said we</p>
<p>need to go to Baltimore</p>
<p>Elisha has a question go ahead Alicia</p>
<p>yes how do you dawn right I am free I am</p>
<p>free diabetic and I am also 346 pounds</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;ve lost 30 pounds so far</p>
<p>good my doctor put me on meds Foreman</p>
<p>two in the morning and two at night</p>
<p>which is 500 milligrams per pill so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 2,000 milligrams now my weight</p>
<p>loss doctor had me off there to Maine</p>
<p>and chromium and I do two b12 shot he</p>
<p>also put me on al carotene and Ally</p>
<p>pills right everything is working my a</p>
<p>YC was six point two and now it&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>point nine so everything is working in</p>
<p>this tummy down my weight is coming down</p>
<p>but I really really desire to do the</p>
<p>intimus assassin and I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>confused and how to do it because</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t have an appetite like that but</p>
<p>I have to eat with every peel okay I got</p>
<p>it and I got it okay so let me give you</p>
<p>a tip okay yeah as you do this okay so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna decrease the insulin in your</p>
<p>body it&rsquo;s going to improve in some</p>
<p>resistance the pre-diabetes is going to</p>
<p>really help you the need for met form is</p>
<p>going to go away we&rsquo;ve we down so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like get with your doctor</p>
<p>because the goal is to have your doctor</p>
<p>have you not take any of this medication</p>
<p>down the road hopefully right if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the viewpoint so for you to have to</p>
<p>maybe you could just take less of it and</p>
<p>then start eating because here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem that meal that you&rsquo;re taking to</p>
<p>take your medication is gonna raise</p>
<p>insulin and keep the problem there</p>
<p>longer that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re actually creating the problem</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re eating you&rsquo;re not hungry don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat I&rsquo;m serious your weights gonna come</p>
<p>down your instance gonna come better if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing an insulin resistance so I</p>
<p>would get with your doctor and say</p>
<p>listen how can I take this just once a</p>
<p>day once a day and do that I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re up against because if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock</p>
<p>and a hard place okay Alicia thank you</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Ricardo from Los</p>
<p>Angeles he&rsquo;s been waiting for quite a</p>
<p>while go ahead Ricardo you&rsquo;d a question</p>

<p>good diet and I&rsquo;ve lost quite amount of</p>
<p>pounds awesome thank you so much for</p>
<p>your book um my question is I have a</p>
<p>pituitary tumor I&rsquo;ve had it for for</p>
<p>about eight years I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>car burgling for it lately</p>
<p>first it has me on bromo Krypton and now</p>
<p>they have me on on the cabergoline I</p>
<p>mean I wanted to look for different</p>
<p>approach to this something that will</p>
<p>help me follow me out look something</p>
<p>more natural right yeah okay so let me</p>
<p>tell you what I would do if I were you</p>
<p>instead of be like trying to treat the</p>
<p>tumor with some type of remedy</p>
<p>I would focus on a different thing I</p>
<p>would focus on building up your health</p>
<p>of your body and start putting in the</p>
<p>basics start putting in the keto and in</p>
<p>a fasting do the version that I</p>
<p>recommend because that&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>your immune system in a state where it</p>
<p>needs to be in your endocrine system in</p>
<p>a state so the pituitary the</p>
<p>hypothalamus are all happy and who knows</p>
<p>it might shrink so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>highly recommend as you can hear all</p>
<p>these success stories I mean people are</p>
<p>really having some serious positive</p>
<p>effects okay thank you so much all right</p>
<p>Karen we are gonna wrap up now and thank</p>
<p>you guys so much for your wonderful</p>
<p>questions and any last words of wisdom</p>
<p>Karen no on that note have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend and we will see you next we will</p>
<p>see you next bra Oh we I guess I&rsquo;m some</p>
<p>of them yeah yeah okay guys see you</p>
<p>later</p>
<p>you</p>
