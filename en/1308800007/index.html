    <p>Before moving on to other suspects, whose names were coming in via phone calls and letters</p>
<p>from the public, investigators knew what they had to do next‚Äîgive Ron Hulse another polygraph</p>
<p>test.</p>
<p>I say another because they actually gave him one just three days after Darlene&rsquo;s abduction,</p>
<p>which he passed.</p>
<p>And listen, Ron was never a suspect.</p>
<p>But back then, officers knew that they had to play offense and defense.</p>
<p>And if this case were to ever go to trial, police knew that Ron would be an easy target</p>
<p>for a defense attorney.</p>
<p>So they had to formally rule him out‚Äînot just as a suspect, but of any involvement.</p>
<p>Plus, talking with Ron was a great way for investigators to learn more about Darlene.</p>
<p>As far as bad habits, the only one I ever got her on was the fact that at night she</p>
<p>never pulled the drapes or pulled the shade down.</p>
<p>She just thought that we lived out in a remote area.</p>
<p>Anybody that&rsquo;s out there is going to be sick anyway.</p>
<p>And if I went into the bedroom first, was going to shower or something, then I always</p>
<p>pulled them down.</p>
<p>She never did.</p>
<p>She never did.</p>
<p>And I just wonder now if there&rsquo;s been someone looking all along or what.</p>
<p>Up to this point, they had kind of skimmed over Darlene&rsquo;s lifestyle and personality,</p>
<p>because A, nothing really stuck out as a red flag, and B, they were hot on the trails of</p>
<p>Danny Bender, Robert Zabrowski, and Ricky Mach.</p>
<p>But it was time to understand more about their victim and her husband.</p>
<p>So in October 1984, they sat Ron down again.</p>
<p>This is Episode 6, Evil All Around.</p>
<p>At your request, Ronald Glenn Hulse was examined on the polygraph, a detection of deception</p>
<p>technique.</p>
<p>In the pre-test, the subject gave the following information and admissions.</p>
<p>Subject stated, he knew why he was there, reference, he had been asked by Detective</p>
<p>Criswell to take a polygraph, reference, to cover all the bases, reference, of the investigation</p>
<p>into his wife&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Subject stated, he had nothing to do with his wife&rsquo;s death, Darlene, and that he had</p>
<p>not contacted anyone to come in and take her from the home and kill her, and that he did</p>
<p>not know that Darlene was going to be taken from the house on August 17th, and that he</p>
<p>did not know that she was going to be killed.</p>
<p>Subject advised, he&rsquo;s never talked with Danny Bender, and that he&rsquo;s never talked with anyone</p>
<p>in particular about his finances.</p>
<p>He advised that several people at work knew that his dog would have been gone that week,</p>
<p>but that was something that he had talked about for quite some time, wanting to have</p>
<p>his dog bred.</p>
<p>Marshall County Lieutenant Ed Criswell conducted the Q&amp;A part of Ron&rsquo;s interview, and he started</p>
<p>off asking where Darlene did her shopping to try and establish her routine.</p>
<p>As far as incidentals, it was always done at either the mall up at Scottsdale or 3D</p>
<p>in Rochester.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 75% of it was done at 3D.</p>
<p>And how about Argus?</p>
<p>Did you do any shopping at Argus at all?</p>
<p>Oh, the parking shop and stuff like that, you know, for odds and ends, but she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like to go into Argus very often like that.</p>
<p>Things were too high.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She did most of her buying in&hellip;</p>
<p>Rochester.</p>
<p>What were some of her habits?</p>
<p>What were her daily routine?</p>
<p>Well, as far as getting up, generally a quarter till seven.</p>
<p>Was always&hellip;</p>
<p>The alarm was set for 6.45, bathing the children, getting them ready in the summer, you know.</p>
<p>She liked to take off around 10 or 10.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been going lately to Jellystone Pool, trying to go there once a week.</p>
<p>Last year, she had gone to Lake Maxinkuckee.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s gone there this year at all.</p>
<p>Jellystone Pool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And do you have a membership out there?</p>
<p>No, that&hellip;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a girlfriend she usually went with that knew someone that got her in for nothing</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>About the only other place she went would be piano lessons for the kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Otherwise, she&rsquo;s pretty much a homebody.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t one to go out.</p>
<p>I had the old car at home and it was terrible on gas.</p>
<p>We really watched that.</p>
<p>So if we went anyplace, it was as a family in the evening.</p>
<p>I understand you said something to one of the officers about her having an exercise</p>
<p>routine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There for a while, she hasn&rsquo;t done this now for a few weeks, she&rsquo;d take a walk around</p>
<p>the square.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d go east from the house down to 110, all the way down to 31 and back.</p>
<p>That was her exercise, just walking.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Criswell asked Ron to recap the week before the abduction, trying to see if</p>
<p>he remembered anything weird happening.</p>
<p>I tell you, of all the weeks we&rsquo;ve had this summer, I&rsquo;d say that was about the least active</p>
<p>week we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been doing a lot of canning at home, except for one day on Wednesday, previous</p>
<p>to the incident, she hadn&rsquo;t gone anywhere.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been putting the garden up.</p>
<p>I think she just finished it up Thursday evening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty boring week for her.</p>
<p>Ron said the only thing out of the routine for that week was the fact that they were</p>
<p>having issues with their new refrigerator, and a guy named Lee Chisholm, who owned the</p>
<p>nearby appliance store where they bought the fridge, was going to come by and take</p>
<p>a look.</p>
<p>We called him, and he was supposed to come down shortly then and fix it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, he was on his way at 9.30 that morning, drove by the road and said,</p>
<p>well, I promised I&rsquo;d call first, so he kept driving, and went into Rochester.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;d guess the next questions might have been about this Lee guy, who was apparently</p>
<p>supposed to be arriving at the Hulse home on the exact day, at the exact time Darlene</p>
<p>was attacked.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d be wrong.</p>
<p>Instead, Lt. Criswell asked Ron what was wrong with his refrigerator light, and then they</p>
<p>moved on to talking about their relatives, basically to gauge if there were any creepy</p>
<p>boyfriends of Darlene&rsquo;s sisters that had come around or anything like that.</p>
<p>Ron said no, pretty much everyone within their immediate and distant circles were upstanding</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Ron admitted that there was some family drama between them and Darlene&rsquo;s parents regarding</p>
<p>a family business, but it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious.</p>
<p>They both came from religious families and weren&rsquo;t ones to let greed or spite destroy</p>
<p>relationships.</p>
<p>They were good, church-going folk who were all about love and giving.</p>
<p>And speaking of church, Lt. Criswell then asked Ron why he and Darlene had hopped around</p>
<p>to lots of different churches lately.</p>
<p>Why not just stick with one?</p>
<p>We went to First Baptist.</p>
<p>We went for about a year and a half and just felt like we weren&rsquo;t getting what we needed.</p>
<p>So we visited a couple other, and when we visited, it was generally just for a Sunday</p>
<p>or two, and then we&rsquo;d move on.</p>
<p>Got back to the First Baptist for a while, and then we&rsquo;d settle in down at Liberty Baptist</p>
<p>down in Rochester.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a half dozen churches that we&rsquo;d visited in the last, oh, two and a half</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly were you looking for?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not out to be entertained.</p>
<p>We want good, basic Bible doctrine.</p>
<p>Okay, a lot of these people are out for the Sunday school programs for the kids and this</p>
<p>and that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>We just want a good preacher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Your social life then would probably mainly revolve around the church.</p>
<p>Even then, we didn&rsquo;t have much contact.</p>
<p>We were not party goers.</p>
<p>We only go out to eat once in a couple months.</p>
<p>Pretty thrifty, not extravagant.</p>
<p>Well, during your travels from one church to the other, did there, was there ever a</p>
<p>time that you felt that someone had taken a special interest in Darlene?</p>
<p>You and I both know that usually you can tell when somebody&rsquo;s a little interested.</p>
<p>No, I really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anybody contact her from the church?</p>
<p>Well, we were always getting letters from the other churches and stuff thanking us for</p>
<p>our visitation and stuff.</p>
<p>But as far as, we had a couple of pastors come over for a visit, but no.</p>
<p>She was a, Darlene was a hard person to talk to.</p>
<p>She was real quiet and she wasn&rsquo;t really one to open up to anyone.</p>
<p>So I was generally around her all the time.</p>
<p>If people called ahead of time, she&rsquo;d make arrangements so I could be there too.</p>
<p>She was pretty quiet and shy.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t think of anyone.</p>
<p>No, if there had been, she would have told me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d have been awfully shook up.</p>
<p>How about your marriage to Darlene in general?</p>
<p>Did you guys communicate?</p>
<p>Never went to bed mad, not once.</p>
<p>You had differences though.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always had arguments and stuff, but no sleeping on the couch or running off to</p>
<p>mama&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Not once.</p>
<p>Ever had any fights?</p>
<p>What I mean, you ever slap her or?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Or she ever slap you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fairy book, but we&rsquo;ve really got a good marriage.</p>
<p>Ron passed the polygraph with the conclusion stating, quote, after careful analysis of</p>
<p>this subject&rsquo;s polygrams, it is in the opinion of the examiner that he told substantially</p>
<p>the truth during his examination.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Police never questioned Ron&rsquo;s alibi since he was at work when the crime happened, coupled</p>
<p>with the fact that the girls saw the intruder and it wasn&rsquo;t anyone they recognized.</p>
<p>But there had been some hushed whispers about him around town not long after the murder</p>
<p>because Ron gave an interview to the local paper, The Pilot News, saying, quote, I just</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s his will.</p>
<p>Darlene was ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready whenever he wants to take me.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>He went on to say in that same article that he didn&rsquo;t understand why something so awful</p>
<p>would happen to his wife, but that it must have been God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>He said, quote, I don&rsquo;t understand, but I accept it.</p>
<p>People side eyed those remarks and gossip spread.</p>
<p>Even online today, sometimes people point the finger at him.</p>
<p>Sure, he wasn&rsquo;t the one who took Darlene, they&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Otherwise his daughters would have seen him.</p>
<p>But he could have maybe hired someone.</p>
<p>But let me tell you, that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s attack was anything but a professional job.</p>
<p>The attacker didn&rsquo;t come prepared.</p>
<p>He used her fire poker to subdue her.</p>
<p>Ron is not now, nor has he ever been a suspect.</p>
<p>And listen, I get his comments may feel strange to some people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very religious myself, but I do come from a family that was.</p>
<p>And I understand what he said.</p>
<p>It was something that he could hold on to in a time where his whole life was upended.</p>
<p>He also told the reporter that he thought Darlene&rsquo;s attack was random, which might</p>
<p>have also been comforting in some way.</p>
<p>After losing Darlene, Ron tried his best to be there for his daughters.</p>
<p>But Marie said that some things were harsh reminders of what the family had lost.</p>
<p>Things like mornings spent with their mom.</p>
<p>My dad hired a babysitter.</p>
<p>Her name was Lori.</p>
<p>And I remember being aggravated because I just didn&rsquo;t, I mean, she was fine, but I was</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t want to see her first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And he was, she was there instead of my dad.</p>
<p>And it just felt lonely.</p>
<p>I mean, my aunts chipped in, but it was more like, from my memory, they would watch us</p>
<p>like after school, not first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And I remember the mornings being hard to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the mornings anymore.</p>
<p>Eventually, the family established a new routine.</p>
<p>Ron went back to work.</p>
<p>The girls went back to school.</p>
<p>And Ron remarried a woman named Chris.</p>
<p>One of Darlene&rsquo;s friends had actually set Ron up with Chris, and the girls went on his</p>
<p>first date with her.</p>
<p>I think that when she married my dad, I know that she loved us and she didn&rsquo;t think she</p>
<p>could have children.</p>
<p>So, you know, you look at it from that perspective, like, I don&rsquo;t know that I could marry someone</p>
<p>with three small children and take that role on.</p>
<p>So that was a huge sacrifice on her part.</p>
<p>Chris had been a substitute teacher in Argus, so the girls were familiar with her prior</p>
<p>to her dating and marrying their dad.</p>
<p>And the two are still together today.</p>
<p>As Ron continued trying to rebuild their life and establish a new one with his new wife,</p>
<p>police were going back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>In an effort to draw in some new information, they went knocking on doors in Argus.</p>
<p>Police really wanted to know if anyone else had any problems with peeping Toms or harassing</p>
<p>phone calls or literally anything.</p>
<p>One woman named Karen said she noticed a white car watching their house during evening hours,</p>
<p>but had been months since she&rsquo;d last seen it.</p>
<p>In fact, she said, she hadn&rsquo;t seen it since Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Another couple said their 18-year-old daughter had gotten creepy phone calls from a man.</p>
<p>They said the man would ask when her dad would be home, how old she was, and if her parents</p>
<p>were home.</p>
<p>A woman named Marsha, who lived nearby with her family, said that she&rsquo;d also gotten</p>
<p>some creepy phone calls in the past year, mainly heavy breathing and dirty talk.</p>
<p>Similarly, a neighbor named Rex said that his household had gotten some calls with filthy</p>
<p>language and they had happened three or four times since Darlene was killed.</p>
<p>Rex also said they had one strange visitor who said that he was a preacher, but he had</p>
<p>a car full of girls with him.</p>
<p>And then some other neighbors reiterated rumors that police were already familiar with, involving</p>
<p>Ricky Mock and Danny Bender.</p>
<p>Since so many people had talked about having phone calls from creepy men, and because so</p>
<p>much time had passed and investigators were really starting to spiral, police decided</p>
<p>to look into other crimes that they may have missed before.</p>
<p>Maybe smaller things like break-ins, thefts, whatever.</p>
<p>And they actually found a crime that interests them.</p>
<p>A break-in, an attempted sexual assault that happened at a house just a stone&rsquo;s throw</p>
<p>away from where Darlene&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>It happened in December 1982.</p>
<p>It was early in the morning and a woman was at home asleep when her phone rang.</p>
<p>The man on the other end asked if her husband was home, and the woman, I&rsquo;ll call her Pam,</p>
<p>said that no, he was at work and he wouldn&rsquo;t be home until later that evening.</p>
<p>They hung up, and soon after, a man came bursting through her front door and running</p>
<p>down her hallway to her bedroom.</p>
<p>The man pinned her to the bed, but Pam was able to fight him off before he was able to</p>
<p>assault her.</p>
<p>And he gave up and ran back out the front door.</p>
<p>In 1985, when police went back to look at the details of this case and compare it to</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s, Pam&rsquo;s case was still unsolved.</p>
<p>And the location was almost eerie.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s home, where she was attacked, was just across State Road 110 from where</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s body had been found off Olive Trail.</p>
<p>I mean, like, even in a small town, this was strangely close.</p>
<p>Now, the problem was, again, Pam&rsquo;s case was unsolved.</p>
<p>So weird, yeah, connected, maybe?</p>
<p>There was some blood from the intruder left at Pam&rsquo;s house, and I know they tried to</p>
<p>compare it to at least one of their known suspects, Robert Zebrowski, that traveling</p>
<p>carny.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a match for his blood type.</p>
<p>So it seems like the idea of a connection, while there, didn&rsquo;t further the case.</p>
<p>And the investigation into Darlene&rsquo;s murder slowed down as police got busy working other</p>
<p>violent crimes in the area.</p>
<p>In August 1986, a night manager at the Plymouth Dairy Queen was shot and killed at work.</p>
<p>In October 1986, a 47-year-old woman died in a suspicious fire at her house in nearby</p>
<p>Bremen.</p>
<p>And on December 11, 1986, 11-year-old Brandi Peltz was sexually assaulted and strangled</p>
<p>in her house in rural Argus, just 1.5 miles north of the Holst home.</p>
<p>Brandi&rsquo;s murder shocked the community that was still recovering from Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Brandi&rsquo;s case even hit close to home for one of the Holst daughters, Marie.</p>
<p>She and Brandi had been in the same grade in school.</p>
<p>That just tells you how small this town was.</p>
<p>She rode my bus, and she didn&rsquo;t go to school that day, and we were on the same bus route,</p>
<p>and our house was further out than her house, and she was not on the bus, and we were coming</p>
<p>home from school that day, and we saw smoke billowing out of her house.</p>
<p>It just felt surreal, because that was just a couple years later, I think.</p>
<p>December 11, 1986 had been a Thursday, and Brandi wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, so she stayed</p>
<p>home from school.</p>
<p>She was old enough to stay home alone, so Brandi&rsquo;s mom, Roxy, went to work at Hollins</p>
<p>Hardware.</p>
<p>During her lunch break that day, Roxy went home to check on her daughter and bring her</p>
<p>some lunch.</p>
<p>Everything was fine, so Roxy returned to work.</p>
<p>And sometime after she got back, Brandi called her mom and said that someone had just called</p>
<p>the house and was breathing heavily into the phone, but the person didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Now this had happened before, apparently, and it creeped them out, so Roxy had previously</p>
<p>notified the telephone company, but she hadn&rsquo;t reported the calls to police.</p>
<p>Now because this had happened before, it was kind of part of their routine.</p>
<p>Brandi let her mom know, but she said she felt safe and she felt fine at home.</p>
<p>So they hung up, and her mom said she would see her after work.</p>
<p>But later that day, around 3 p.m., a school teacher driving on Old Highway 31 saw smoke</p>
<p>coming from the Peltz house, so he stopped at a neighbor&rsquo;s house and asked them to call</p>
<p>the Argus Fire Department.</p>
<p>He then went back to the Peltz home and went inside.</p>
<p>First, he let out a barking dog, and then he walked around the first floor, and as he</p>
<p>was yelling for anyone inside to get out, he went inside the bathroom and found Brandi&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body in the tub.</p>
<p>When police got there, they immediately noted the kitchen telephone had been ripped out</p>
<p>of the wall receiver, which told them that Brandi likely tried to call for help when</p>
<p>her killer came inside.</p>
<p>They also thought that it looked as if her body had been placed in the tub after she</p>
<p>was killed.</p>
<p>The autopsy revealed that Brandi had been sexually assaulted and strangled.</p>
<p>The water from the bathtub and the fire in the house were most likely efforts to cover</p>
<p>up any evidence left behind.</p>
<p>These days, if you go to Argus and ask locals about the unsolved murder, they bring up Brandi.</p>
<p>This is the case that people remember, the little girl violated and murdered in her own</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>Someone even self-published a novel about it, and even though it&rsquo;s fiction, the author</p>
<p>admitted that it&rsquo;s about Brandi&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Though most people from Argus dismissed the book entirely, calling it sensational and</p>
<p>untrue.</p>
<p>The South Bend Tribune ran an article on December 14th, 1986 about how many calls police were</p>
<p>getting about Brandi&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>In the story, reporter John Wilcox wrote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;people here are concerned, remembering and wondering if there is any connection between</p>
<p>the pelt-slaying Thursday and the yet-unsolved August 1984 slaying of Darlene Hulse, who</p>
<p>lived just one and a half miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tribune quoted an anonymous co-worker of Roxy&rsquo;s, who said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;a lot of things like that are going through our minds.</p>
<p>Quite a few people have been talking about it in private,&rdquo; end quote.</p>
<p>That question was the right one.</p>
<p>Are they connected?</p>
<p>If they were, it meant investigators&rsquo; worst fears were confirmed.</p>
<p>Their killer wasn&rsquo;t some evil man just passing through town.</p>
<p>He was living among them.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>Local police decided it was time to get some assistance from the feds.</p>
<p>So Sergeant Yokelet wrote the FBI and spelled it all out in a letter.</p>
<p>The undersigned investigating the homicides of Brandi Peltz and Darlene Hulse and the</p>
<p>home invasion of Pam has investigated these crimes from the standpoint of being individual</p>
<p>cases and that the assailants responsible for those cases are separate individuals and</p>
<p>that these cases are unrelated.</p>
<p>And it is only coincidence that they have occurred within a particular geographical</p>
<p>area.</p>
<p>At the same time, this officer has geared my investigations to include that very well,</p>
<p>that all three of these cases may be linked together, and I base that opinion on several</p>
<p>similarities that I feel exist in each of these cases.&quot;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get the Fed&rsquo;s take and a brand new suspect in Episode 7, Bring in the FBI.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
