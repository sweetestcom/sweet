because you really talk about the</p>
<p>vegetable oils and the impact of
vegetable oils on the</p>
<p>your eye but how did you stumble on this

<p>i definitely stumbled into it and
uh to be honest with you and the</p>
<p>audience is that

<p>16 years
and just in a nutshell i kind of went</p>
<p>partial paleo and in about 10 days my
arthritis</p>
<p>improved about 80 that was back in 2011.
wow and eric it was</p>
<p>so phenomenally uh life
altering to me after all this suffering</p>
<p>i had had and after seeing so many of my
physician colleagues to try to help me</p>
<p>and a dietary change which nobody had
suggested</p>
<p>made that kind of change for me it just
it just uh instilled a desire in me</p>
<p>to want to know more and then the more i
started digging into this the more</p>
<p>interested i became and and that just
kind of</p>
<p>ballooned and really i guess
if you want the rest of the back story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that
that was 2011 and in 2013 i came across</p>
<p>the research of weston a
price and are your is your audience</p>
<p>quite familiar with price&rsquo;s work most of
them are</p>
<p>um absolutely so yeah i think so
okay so so just very briefly</p>
<p>um weston price uh
did phenomenal research in the 1930s</p>
<p>where he evaluated
people all over the world on five</p>
<p>continents as they transitioned from
native traditional diets over to</p>
<p>westernized diets and westernized diets
essentially contained refined white</p>
<p>flours
added sugars vegetable oils</p>
<p>trans fats canned goods sweets
confectionary</p>
<p>in essence processed foods and price
noted how those foods</p>
<p>drove westernized disease that started
with</p>
<p>dental decay and then was followed by
arthritis and cancers and</p>
<p>all kinds of degenerative disease and so
that was 2013 for me eric</p>
<p>and later that year as i continued to
study</p>
<p>it just suddenly hit me in late 2013
that after i had understood that</p>
<p>westernized processed foods are driving
heart disease cancers strokes</p>
<p>hypertension
type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>obesity
autoimmune diseases when i understood</p>
<p>all that finally
it hit me and i thought could processed</p>
<p>foods be driving
age-related macular degeneration amd</p>
<p>which is the leading cause of
irreversible vision loss</p>
<p>and blindness in people over the age of
65</p>
<p>worldwide and uh
this is something that you know i had</p>
<p>dealt with in the clinic for 24 years at
that point</p>
<p>and in any case so then i
followed down that path and i continued</p>
<p>and
to investigate that while i was in</p>
<p>practice for about the next year and a
half</p>
<p>and in early 2015 i felt i had enough
evidence and i was convinced that i was</p>
<p>on the right path
although i couldn&rsquo;t bear i knew i had</p>
<p>needed a ton of study
and some more you know fundamental</p>
<p>research and i left practice to pursue
that</p>
<p>so so a question about where did you
personally have</p>
<p>arthritis was it all over your body was
it in your back where was it</p>
<p>yeah so it when i was about 34 years old
um it you know it started mostly in my</p>
<p>knees
and i had a lot of trouble with my knees</p>
<p>in my
mid to late 30s and then</p>
<p>and then it i think next it kind of hit
my</p>
<p>elbows and then my shoulders and then my
neck and then eventually my</p>
<p>fingers my toes pretty soon i was
riddled with arthritis and i was 50</p>
<p>years old at
in 2011 and</p>
<p>eric i was in severe pain and i i&rsquo;ve
always been</p>
<p>athletic and i got into where i just
it was so hard for me to even just jog</p>
<p>or warm up to lift weights
uh it was just i just you know</p>
<p>was on a disastrous path wow
it sounds like we go ahead well i was</p>
<p>given
uh an immunosuppressant which i took for</p>
<p>one day
and the next day i heard about the paleo</p>
<p>diet
and started like i said kind of a</p>
<p>makeshift
paleo because i wasn&rsquo;t convinced i was</p>
<p>very skeptical
everything i&rsquo;d done for 16 years with my</p>
<p>arthritis was
a you know a fail and those but that was</p>
<p>all drugs
wow like i said i&rsquo;ve probably seen a</p>
<p>dozen of my physician colleagues
and um i don&rsquo;t want to make this all</p>
<p>about my arthritis but nevertheless i
mean none of them had ever said</p>
<p>one thing about diet it was always a
drug an injection</p>
<p>steroids you know all that fascinating
i think we have i think we have</p>
<p>something in common because when i was
28 i had the ex</p>
<p>similar thing i started noticing
arthritis in my hands</p>
<p>all down my back my spine i told my wife
i&rsquo;m like what the heck is going on</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m in my 20s and i got arthritis
and so i had it a little bit earlier</p>
<p>than you but i know
exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going everywhere trying to help at that
time i lived in san diego</p>
<p>um and i actually stumbled uh
price and pottinger had a whole center</p>
<p>there and that&rsquo;s where i got introduced
to them</p>
<p>as well which is interesting so i
started turning things around but</p>
<p>um getting back to the macula okay what
is the macula of the eye</p>
<p>so the macula is the central retina
it accounts for about the central 10</p>
<p>degrees of vision
and it is responsible for</p>
<p>you being able to see somebody&rsquo;s face to
read words on a page to see a stop sign</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it is your central
vision and if that part of the retina</p>
<p>degenerates then your vision will begin
to decline</p>
<p>and macular degeneration is
probably for ophthalmologists today it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably
uh second only to cataracts in terms of</p>
<p>what uh ophthalmologists deal with at
optometrists too</p>
<p>in westernized countries
and so yeah so this disease</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;ll it gradually steals your vision
typically and then it can progress to a</p>
<p>wet stage which can be
severe and um</p>
<p>let me just tell you that today this
year</p>
<p>they estimate that 196
million people are affected with macular</p>
<p>degeneration in the world
and of those by some estimates the world</p>
<p>health organizations
data would suggest that as of 2006 and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the latest data i have for
blindness</p>
<p>the bilateral blindness probably around
3.15 million people in the world</p>
<p>bilaterally blind meaning both
eyes centrally blind they can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>their their
their they can&rsquo;t see their spouse&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>their grandchildren&rsquo;s face they can&rsquo;t
see to drive or</p>
<p>read and if you think about that that
is a staggering number of people it may</p>
<p>be more than that so it could be
approaching the population of the state</p>
<p>of colorado
where i live today in the world all</p>
<p>blind
you know from this disease and and you</p>
<p>know when i first investigated this
eric what i saw i had to go back and</p>
<p>look at all the history and
this i couldn&rsquo;t find anybody who any</p>
<p>research that had done this and what i
found</p>
<p>was that in a nutshell that between 1851
when mac</p>
<p>when the when the retina was first
visible</p>
<p>uh because of the invention of the
ophthalmoscope and then over the next 80</p>
<p>years up until about 1930
there was no more than about 50 cases</p>
<p>of macular degeneration in all the
world&rsquo;s literature</p>
<p>and ophthalmologists were using the
ophthalmoscope</p>
<p>and recording images and diagrams in the
1850s</p>
<p>and so i go i go through that data but
in a nutshell</p>
<p>you know what i found was that this
disease was extraordinarily rare</p>
<p>and it changed as our
diet changed and the the big picture</p>
<p>here
everybody uh if you don&rsquo;t already know</p>
<p>this
is that we didn&rsquo;t have any man-made</p>
<p>processed foods
in the world with the exception of sugar</p>
<p>up until
1866 approximately so we had very small</p>
<p>quantities of sugar
processed foods again being sugar</p>
<p>refined flours
vegetable oils and trans fats and in 18</p>
<p>right after the american civil war 1866
is when we first got</p>
<p>vegetable oils we got refined white
wheat flour in 1880</p>
<p>because of roller mill technology which
is another</p>
<p>refined nutrient deficient food and then
in 1911 we got trans fats and if you put</p>
<p>those
four foods together that makes up</p>
<p>processed food
it&rsquo;s so incredibly simple but those four</p>
<p>things
now uh big food manufacturers make 500</p>
<p>some thousand foods out of those today
and those</p>
<p>first of all are severely nutrient
deficient and then they are toxic</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what what i will submit to
you</p>
<p>is that almost all of these chronic
diseases</p>
<p>are driven by nutrient deficiency and
toxicity and they</p>
<p>all come from these foods the foods are
nutrient deficient those four processed</p>
<p>foods
and then they have toxicity related</p>
<p>primarily
to vegetable oils trans fats and and</p>
<p>probably the
and the fructose component of sugar if</p>
<p>the dose is right
well you know you know i um if you take</p>
<p>a look at each one of those individually
i looked at the</p>
<p>consumption i think before 1970 i just
looked at 1970 to now</p>
<p>and we have a trend going up with
refined grains we have a</p>
<p>trend in going up with sugar but what i
didn&rsquo;t understand until i looked at your</p>
<p>stuff
is that there is a massive spike i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 4x with vegetable oils i mean
that&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>really took off and
you know we&rsquo;re all emphasizing avoid</p>
<p>sugar well yeah we know that
but there&rsquo;s not enough emphasis about</p>
<p>avoiding the vegetable fats and
understanding what they can do</p>
<p>not just to your eye but their whole
body they can cause insulin resistance</p>
<p>just like sugar
um and i guess these that&rsquo;s the way that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re processed
is just completely and utterly um</p>
<p>barbaric i mean it&rsquo;s like white i mean
they&rsquo;re heating it and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s nothing left i mean
and they&rsquo;re very inflammatory so</p>
<p>so when you look at when you look at the
macula and you&rsquo;re trying to evaluate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with someone&rsquo;s vision
and let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s just starting to</p>
<p>become a problem
would it and they&rsquo;re just would they</p>
<p>notice like oh i&rsquo;m not seeing that well
and that could be other that could be</p>
<p>maybe the eyeball&rsquo;s not shaped correctly
maybe the lens is not correct</p>
<p>or it could be the macula is the
symptom of lack of eyesight very similar</p>
<p>to all four of those causes or are they
or is it a different thing where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the central part of your eye you can&rsquo;t
see because the macula</p>
<p>handles so there&rsquo;s blurry in like a
little circle when you look or</p>
<p>how would you differentiate macular
versus just the shape of the eyeball is</p>
<p>is not right as far as vision goes yeah
good question</p>
<p>so first of all you uh
may not have any symptoms in the early</p>
<p>stages of macular degeneration
in fact you probably won&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>anything
and the the symptoms of any decrease in</p>
<p>vision
you would never be able to distinguish</p>
<p>on your own from
cataract or from refractive error you</p>
<p>know being nearsighted or
asymmetric or farsighted or whatever</p>
<p>or maybe even glaucoma you&rsquo;re not going
to be able to distinguish</p>
<p>anything yourself and you should never
rely on your own</p>
<p>perception of your vision you need to
see</p>
<p>an ophthalmologist or an optometrist to
be evaluated</p>
<p>and have you know have your retina
evaluated</p>
<p>everybody should start doing this in
their 40s for sure</p>
<p>and every you know two to three years i
won&rsquo;t get into all the detail but</p>
<p>people need to have their eyes examined
eric in order to</p>
<p>evaluate for that but the symptoms are
similar</p>
<p>oh they yeah you the the majority of
people that in the early stages of</p>
<p>macular degeneration they&rsquo;re not going
to have any clue at all that they have</p>
<p>this disease and of course this would be
the best time</p>
<p>i mean of course you want to try to
prevent all of these diseases</p>
<p>and the best way to do that the only way
to do that is through</p>
<p>diet and um you know but
but if you have it already the best</p>
<p>thing to do
is is you know see an ophthalmologist</p>
<p>optometrist have a diagnosis and then
you would make the same exact</p>
<p>changes to your diet in order to prevent
progression of the disease that you</p>
<p>would in order to prevent it
it&rsquo;s the same exact exact thing so when</p>
<p>you look at the macula and you&rsquo;re
diagnosing</p>
<p>what is what&rsquo;s what are you seeing is it
uh</p>
<p>extra blood vessels or is there you can
you see like this destruction is there</p>
<p>plaquing like what
what&rsquo;s happening in the macula that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing this this
what does this degeneration look like</p>
<p>well
uh you know the best thing would be to</p>
<p>have a uh an image of that but
you know because</p>
<p>none of our audience is really going to
hardly know what the retina looks like</p>
<p>but you see these little
you know whitish yellow dots called</p>
<p>druzen and you see
something called pigmentary disturbance</p>
<p>which is
is something that is affecting the</p>
<p>retinal pigment epithelium beneath the
you know</p>
<p>beneath the retina proper and those
that&rsquo;s the first stage and that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the uh dry macular degeneration
and if it progresses eric which about 15</p>
<p>10 to 15 percent of the people that have
dry macular degeneration will progress</p>
<p>into the wet stage and this is a stage
where the vessels can grow up underneath</p>
<p>the retina
leak fluid and bleed and that that is</p>
<p>devastating to the vision and
um and the calc can be treated but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that we should get into
that at all but yeah i was just</p>
<p>kind of curious about the effects of um
like this vegetable oils is it as an</p>
<p>oxidative
inflammatory free radical thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating that damage
or is it similar to diabetes where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re
creating um destruction of the blood</p>
<p>vessels
to the eye through the retina itself i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know
but it just i&rsquo;m just curious from my own</p>
<p>viewpoint
yeah you know um i eric i almost have to</p>
<p>uh giggle when people ask me you know
during the</p>
<p>like a podcast or whatever you know what
is the</p>
<p>what is the tell me what the um
the cause of this is at the molecular</p>
<p>level or tell me
what is the mechanism right you know i</p>
<p>was thinking the other day i should say
okay let me</p>
<p>summarize 32 500 scientific papers that
have been published on this in the last</p>
<p>four decades because that&rsquo;s basically
about what there is</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s an extraordinary amount
you know of evidence here to try to</p>
<p>you know put into a nutshell but let me
just say that here</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i would submit as a
big picture is is that vegetable oils</p>
<p>are they have four main problems and
this is going to apply to</p>
<p>macular degeneration heart disease
atherosclerosis</p>
<p>stroke type 2 diabetes metabolic
syndrome</p>
<p>obesity alzheimer&rsquo;s parkinson&rsquo;s
autoimmune okay these the main things</p>
<p>is that vegetable oils are going to are
first going to be nutrient deficient</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have
any vitamins a d and k2</p>
<p>none in any oil even the really good
oils like</p>
<p>a good coconut oil no none of those
vitamins right</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re you know this puts you at
risk for nutrient deficiencies and</p>
<p>vitamins a d and k
2 create an amazing</p>
<p>synchrony and synergy that drives
health and so this is what you know</p>
<p>weston price began to show us back in
the 1930s i mean did an incredible job</p>
<p>with this
all right so that&rsquo;s the first thing you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t so when you used to plant and
replace the healthy animal fats</p>
<p>lard butter beef tallow you know eggs
organ meat fish eggs</p>
<p>all these kinds of things that are that
are rich in these</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamins a d and k two we
used to plant those</p>
<p>with vegetable oils now you&rsquo;re nutrient
deficient that&rsquo;s problem number one</p>
<p>problem number two you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re going
down a pro</p>
<p>oxidative pathway and eric i cannot tell
you how important</p>
<p>i have i&rsquo;ve learned
so much i&rsquo;ve learned over the past few</p>
<p>years that tells me this is the most
important</p>
<p>thing of all on a mechanistic
uh level is the pro-oxidative effect</p>
<p>okay so so that drives oxidation i can
come back and</p>
<p>review that in some detail third
pro-inflammatory</p>
<p>so the the omega-6 seed oils are
pro-inflammatory</p>
<p>gonna lead you down an inflammatory path
and then finally</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re toxic and i don&rsquo;t use this term
toxic loosely</p>
<p>what i mean is is they are poisonous and
they&rsquo;re poisonous</p>
<p>because the seed oils
can they contain and or in our own</p>
<p>bodies will produce
uh toxic aldehydes for one thing but</p>
<p>these toxic
aldehydic end products which are things</p>
<p>like 4-hydroxynonenol which is 4h and e
malone dialdehyde or mda</p>
<p>9 and 13 hoed which is hydroxy octadeca
dianoic acid carboxyethylpyrol and</p>
<p>acrylene these are just
five but there&rsquo;s hundreds of these toxic</p>
<p>aldehydes that are connected with all of
these diseases so collectively</p>
<p>those things right there are cytotoxic
meaning directly toxic to cells</p>
<p>genotoxic you know toxic to
the genes mutagenic carcinogenic</p>
<p>atherogenic atherosclerosis inducing
thrombogenic clot inducing and</p>
<p>obesogenic
and on top of all that you know we have</p>
<p>if you look at the whole picture you
know the</p>
<p>seed oils are driving you know if you
look at this big picture</p>
<p>one of the first things they do is they
drive they they damage the mitochondria</p>
<p>and the first thing that happens
at the mitochondrial level is you become</p>
<p>insulin resistant at the cellular level
and this is where i&rsquo;m seeing insulin</p>
<p>resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction
and the mitochondria are the powerhouses</p>
<p>of the cell
for those who don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s where 90</p>
<p>of our energy is produced and
seed oils severely damage the</p>
<p>mitochondria through these
oxidative effects and you begin to</p>
<p>lose energy and the cell begins to
become dysfunctional</p>
<p>and or dies and now what what i
understand and what you know people</p>
<p>understand
is that that work on this all the time</p>
<p>is that
mitochondrial dysfunction is a part of</p>
<p>all of these chronic diseases it&rsquo;s
you know heart disease congestive heart</p>
<p>failure atherosclerosis
cancers macular degeneration type 2</p>
<p>diabetes metabolic syndrome if i didn&rsquo;t
say it yet</p>
<p>obesity all these disorders are
connected through mitochondrial</p>
<p>dysfunction why would they all have this
and the reason i&rsquo;ll do is oxidative</p>
<p>stress
and where does oxidative stress come</p>
<p>come from
primarily seed oils now</p>
<p>what about someone sitting back watching
this and says well i don&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>corn oil i don&rsquo;t use vegetable oil i
don&rsquo;t use crisco so i&rsquo;m good like i</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the awareness of how
insidious this problem is i mean it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how many foods
i i think i read on your website there</p>
<p>is uh an average person consumes
seven what 700 calories of this stuff</p>
<p>per day in their diet without even
knowing it is</p>
<p>is that am i exaggerating or no no
that&rsquo;s exactly right let&rsquo;s see so</p>
<p>it was 80 grams a day
uh of the average person in 2010</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s we did this research and i
can go back and get</p>
<p>give you the big picture but in 2010 the
average american was consuming 80 grams</p>
<p>of vegetable oil a day well
you know oils fats are nine calories of</p>
<p>grams that&rsquo;s 720
calories and that is 32.5</p>
<p>of u.s consumption literally a third
of our diet is coming out of factories i</p>
<p>mean ivor cummins calls these
factory fats and kate shanahan who</p>
<p>studied
studied this for 25 years</p>
<p>you know she says nature doesn&rsquo;t make
bad fats</p>
<p>factories do and i think that&rsquo;s a
powerful message</p>
<p>because these oils they&rsquo;re not natural
you know they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re uh they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>heated
they&rsquo;re chemically treated they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alkalinized bleached and deodorized
all chemically and heated about four or</p>
<p>five times and by the time they hit this
bottle and you&rsquo;ve got this nice pretty</p>
<p>looking
kind of slightly yellow uh um</p>
<p>oil it looks great but that is a
that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a bottle of poison and</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s extremely oxidized it
contains all these toxic aldehydes</p>
<p>and when you consume it it will
accumulate in your body</p>
<p>but if i go back here eric so if so i
i did this analysis this this will be</p>
<p>coming out in our next
published paper i&rsquo;m working on with a</p>
<p>bunch of other
ophthalmologists and vision scientists</p>
<p>but
but i did an analysis to look at</p>
<p>what our omega-6 linoleic acid that&rsquo;s
the main</p>
<p>fatty acid in seed oils
what our consumption of that fatty acid</p>
<p>would have been in 1865 before the
world had any of these vegetable oils</p>
<p>and it was 2.2 grams
so so we got seed oils by 1866</p>
<p>well by 1909 we were already at 4.84
grams</p>
<p>by 1999 we were
at 18 grams a day and by 2008</p>
<p>we are at 29 grams a day okay now let me
give you the</p>
<p>percentages so in 1865 before the world
had any</p>
<p>vegetable oils um our
in the us for example that 2.2 grams of</p>
<p>omega-6
linoleic acid that is about one percent</p>
<p>of our
caloric consumption by 1909 we&rsquo;re at two</p>
<p>percent of caloric consumption
by 1999 we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>um
sorry here i could try to remember the</p>
<p>numbers um</p>
<p>ah i went blank it&rsquo;s uh oh seven percent
there we go</p>
<p>i have there seven percent of caloric
consumption</p>
<p>and by 2008 11.8 percent just rounded
off</p>
<p>12 of caloric consumption okay now like
a spike</p>
<p>yeah so people will say well we need you
know</p>
<p>little like out there you need omega-6
and omega-3 and you do</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re essential fats you have to have
linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid</p>
<p>which is
the comparable omega-3 but guess how</p>
<p>much you need
0.5 percent of your diet needs to be</p>
<p>omega-6 linoleic acid point five
percent that&rsquo;s the essential half of a</p>
<p>one percent
yeah and and so in other words so we</p>
<p>went from
um you know what right well let me just</p>
<p>put it to
in 2008 we are consuming</p>
<p>24 fold
more omega-6 linoleic acid</p>
<p>than what we actually need to be
consuming</p>
<p>you know i just if you look at all these
you know native</p>
<p>traditional populations which i&rsquo;ve done
and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go through when we do we do the
keto summit i&rsquo;ll hit some of those</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve looked at all these and
all of them their omegas okay none of</p>
<p>them
have any vegetable oils because if you</p>
<p>have vegetable oils
you&rsquo;re already consuming a processed</p>
<p>food diet you&rsquo;re already westernized
but all these native traditional</p>
<p>populations who don&rsquo;t have
sugars white flowers seed oils or trans</p>
<p>fats
all of their own the highest omega 6</p>
<p>like i have found
is still under 2 percent the the</p>
<p>the uh the messiah of kenya and tanzania
they consume 66 animal fat</p>
<p>which is 33 to 45 saturated fat but
they&rsquo;re omega-6</p>
<p>i mean with all that fat 66 of their
diet being animal fat</p>
<p>their omega-6 was still 1.7
well the omega-6 in you know westernized</p>
<p>diets
all around the world today is around 8</p>
<p>to 12
or higher and what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>the whole world is getting overweight
obese and sick sicker than dogs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s and and this problem is
you know i i i was thinking that</p>
<p>the problem is far worse in developed
nations but guess what</p>
<p>the the world health organization shows
us that</p>
<p>developing nations 69 of the deaths in
developing nations</p>
<p>in recent years are from chronic disease
these same things heart disease cancers</p>
<p>strokes hypertension type 2 diabetes
you know all that and guess what so so</p>
<p>let me give you one more statistic
between 1963 and 2003</p>
<p>in developed nations vegetable oils
doubled on average uh</p>
<p>kaiser did this work um
so 40-year period they doubled in</p>
<p>developed nations but in developing
nations</p>
<p>vegetable oils tripled in that same
period of time in that 40-year period</p>
<p>and in developing nations their sugar
consumption is</p>
<p>really low i mean it&rsquo;s the world health
organization says don&rsquo;t consume more</p>
<p>than 10 percent of your calories as
sugar i think that&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>but get you know what they were in
developing nations during that period</p>
<p>19 from well from 1964 to 1994 i believe
it was</p>
<p>their consumption of sugar in developing
nations on average was around</p>
<p>6 to seven percent sugar they&rsquo;re
probably it&rsquo;s not sugar</p>
<p>driving i mean why are all those people
in developing nations</p>
<p>why are they all getting these diseases
at as much or higher rate than we</p>
<p>are right because of vegetable oils
vegetable oils have gone everywhere that</p>
<p>you know every just like western price
showed in the 30s if you could</p>
<p>find if you could get to a place by
roads you know by</p>
<p>a port or roads processed foods were
there</p>
<p>you know the big food manufacturers were
selling their food and there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a few isolated places in the world where
people aren&rsquo;t consuming these foods</p>
<p>what is the um i know if it&rsquo;s the usda
or whatever</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t they recommending that we
consume more vegetable oils</p>
<p>than saturated fats that&rsquo;s been the push
right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know about the usda eric but i
can tell you this</p>
<p>um the so you know sally fallon from the
western area price foundation calls</p>
<p>the these organizations the diet
dictocrats</p>
<p>and and she&rsquo;s talking about the
harvard school of public health and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not you know this is not
about harvard it&rsquo;s about the harvard</p>
<p>school of public health
and then the nutrition department of</p>
<p>tufts university also in boston
the nutrition department of mayo clinic</p>
<p>the american heart association and
there&rsquo;s a bunch of others</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all collectively telling us
vegetable oils are healthy</p>
<p>omega-6 is healthy and
so people are so confused because i mean</p>
<p>if harvard tells you it&rsquo;s healthy who
are you to believe</p>
<p>right and um but you know you this is
why this is one of the reasons i think</p>
<p>people like
you and me and you know chris masterjohn</p>
<p>and chris cresser and
joe mercola you know get into this is</p>
<p>because
you know most of us from our own</p>
<p>suffering and you start going i gotta
figure this out because</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t trust the diet dictocrats to
tell me what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>why do they tell us this eric there&rsquo;s
only one reason they tell us vegetable</p>
<p>oils are healthy
one reason as far as i know and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because
vegetable oils make your cholesterol go</p>
<p>down so if you believe
that cholesterol is the problem in heart</p>
<p>disease
you might buy this argument and that is</p>
<p>such a
massive fallacy as you know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about cholesterol it&rsquo;s about
uh you know it&rsquo;s not about ldl it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about oxidized ldl when we talk about
and all that where does oxidized ldl</p>
<p>come from it comes from the exact same
thing</p>
<p>vegetable oils and sugar possible you
know to a lesser degree but vegetable</p>
<p>oils
are driving oxidized ldl and</p>
<p>oxidized ldl drives atherosclerosis
drives coronary</p>
<p>heart disease and you know ivor cummins
has showed us that</p>
<p>you know i mean he&rsquo;s brought our
attention to the fact these studies have</p>
<p>shown for example that
um the greater your oxidized ldl</p>
<p>the greater your heart disease on a
coronary artery calcium scan which</p>
<p>is the gold standard for evaluating
heart disease i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>nice i had mine it was zero two probably
would have been a lot higher before</p>
<p>and i know you&rsquo;ll get more into this in
the summit but um</p>
<p>these vegetables also have a half-life
of i think one to two years and</p>
<p>they make up your cell membranes they go
into the body</p>
<p>and they um if your body&rsquo;s made of these
oils</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot different structurally and
it&rsquo;s going to affect you on a whole</p>
<p>different level probably stiffening of
the arteries who knows what else</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just crazy yeah so if okay
if you</p>
<p>eat you eat sugar today
if i eat a cup of sugar today i can</p>
<p>either store it as glycogen
in my liver and muscles or i if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s if i&rsquo;ve consumed enough
calories i&rsquo;m going to convert it</p>
<p>mostly into monounsaturated and
saturated fat right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to be stored as
but if you consume polyunsaturated fats</p>
<p>your body these omega-6 oils we&rsquo;re
talking about</p>
<p>and omega-3 too your body was not
it was designed to get these in really</p>
<p>tiny quantities because we weren&rsquo;t
designed to ever have vegetable</p>
<p>oils in our diets and so your body
stores these omega-6 and omega-3s</p>
<p>preferentially
and it doesn&rsquo;t want to burn them bait</p>
<p>oxidize them for fuel
i mean that doesn&rsquo;t work well we could</p>
<p>talk about that but anyway so
yes you store them and they get stored</p>
<p>in your fat
and they get stored in your cellular</p>
<p>membranes and they get stored
in your mitochondrial membranes where</p>
<p>they create all this havoc
and the thing is is they store at</p>
<p>approximately
your as an approximate</p>
<p>level whatever you&rsquo;re consuming
in your diet your adipose tissue will be</p>
<p>approximately
twice as high in this omega-6 so if you</p>
<p>consume
one percent of your diet as omega-6</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably be no more than three to
four percent</p>
<p>i said roughly okay you know with your
in in your omega-6 in your fat</p>
<p>but if you consume 10 or 12 percent of
your diet as omega-6</p>
<p>you will be at about 20 some percent
in your fat so stefan gnay</p>
<p>showed this data just brilliant stuff in
19</p>
<p>he looked at 37 studies that looked at
the linoleic</p>
<p>acid in our body fat in americans body
fat just americans</p>
<p>37 studies and collated all this data
graphed it</p>
<p>so 1959 the average linoleic acid
omega-6 in americans fat was</p>
<p>uh 9.1
9.1 now remember obesity in 1960 was 13</p>
<p>percent in the u.s
2008 um</p>
<p>linoleic acid in americans fat averaged
21 and a half percent what was obesity</p>
<p>in 2008 i think it was around 32
something like that and um</p>
<p>all of these diseases have tracked
accordingly so</p>
<p>so this is what we see is the more of
these you consume the more they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stored in your fat
and they stay there okay oh and back to</p>
<p>your your question how long are they in
your fat well this is the really bad</p>
<p>news this is where you have to pay for
your nutritional sins</p>
<p>and i hate this but the the half-life
shown in studies and there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>multiple studies that have looked at
this but the half-life</p>
<p>of these omega-6 fats in your
fat is 600 to 680 days you might as well</p>
<p>round it off to around
two uh two years now the you know the</p>
<p>in pharmacology what we learn is it
takes about five</p>
<p>half-lives to get rid of
a substance like a drug from your body</p>
<p>now nobody knows
if that&rsquo;s applies exactly to linoleic</p>
<p>acid but as a rough estimate then that
means that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna it&rsquo;s gonna take a
few years maybe up to even eight or ten</p>
<p>years
once you get all these out of your diet</p>
<p>you get your omega-6 really low to get
your</p>
<p>omega-6 in your fat down down to really
low level like it should be but you know</p>
<p>what
in three days of go of getting vegetable</p>
<p>oils out of your diet
your inflammation markers will go down</p>
<p>your pro-oxidative status will go
down your toxicity from the aldehydes</p>
<p>will go down
guess what you&rsquo;ll have far less risk</p>
<p>uh you i believe of heart attack and
stroke</p>
<p>in three days wow you know this
uh if if you&rsquo;re watching and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wondering
what oils we&rsquo;re talking about we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about soy
corn canola cotton seed</p>
<p>probably some other ones as well like um
safflower sunflower</p>
<p>maybe even peanut oil i don&rsquo;t know
peanut oil yes</p>
<p>all of those yeah so i&rsquo;ll say them too
it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>soybean corn canola cottonseed
rapeseed grape seed sunflower safflower</p>
<p>and rice bran those are the biggies
there&rsquo;s a few others</p>
<p>and but those are the big ones so you
know if you just want to stick</p>
<p>get we got to get the big picture right
first and that&rsquo;s just just</p>
<p>get those out of your diet yeah start
reading labels too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the salad dressing oh send me
mayonnaise you can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a salad dressing without it i mean it&rsquo;s
difficult so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible and i wouldn&rsquo;t
you know even a salad</p>
<p>this is where you know sally fallon says
where&rsquo;s the best place to start she says</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s with your
salad dressing because they&rsquo;re all made</p>
<p>with these vegetable oils
and you probably you and your audience</p>
<p>probably both know this eric but
you can&rsquo;t trust olive oil in the united</p>
<p>states
79 of it is adulterated with these</p>
<p>vegetable oils
and why is that it&rsquo;s because um even</p>
<p>olive oil
and we can talk about olive oil uh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not
the biggest fan partly for this reason</p>
<p>but there it&rsquo;s being adulterated
so greatly that you you know 80</p>
<p>essentially of the olive oils in the us
you can&rsquo;t trust because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adulterated with all these
cheap just you know horrible oils</p>
<p>and why is that because it&rsquo;s very
profitable olive oil good</p>
<p>extra virgin olive oil that&rsquo;s properly
prepared and maintained and all that is</p>
<p>expensive
the seed oils are dirt cheap</p>
<p>um in 2000 uh as recently as 2014
one on the world&rsquo;s market</p>
<p>one kilogram of the vegetable of these
vegetable oils</p>
<p>on average was one u.s
dollar oh well come on 80 grams a day</p>
<p>of that you know in the american diet
works out to be about</p>
<p>8 cents i think it is and as low as
for soybean oil as low as 5.6 cents</p>
<p>so in other words so here&rsquo;s the thing is
you can take</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you want to make pop tarts as
a big food manufacturer</p>
<p>you can take you know 5.6 cents or 8
cents worth of</p>
<p>of these oils you can take two cents
worth of refined wheat flour and</p>
<p>two cents worth of sugar and you can
make pop-tarts</p>
<p>and sell them for four dollars and
so most of the money goes into the</p>
<p>marketing not into the product
right the box and so so and and so</p>
<p>getting back to your you know
question and statement about these are</p>
<p>in all the foods well guess what
everything you almost all the processed</p>
<p>foods you look out
you know they&rsquo;re made uh primarily of</p>
<p>these four things you know i mean
you just put them together just look at</p>
<p>every label and you find out
most of them are going to be made from</p>
<p>refined flours sugars and seed oils
it&rsquo;s got any of those oils you know i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t touch it with a 10-foot pole
and be really</p>
<p>careful about olive oil i wouldn&rsquo;t trust
most of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sad fact i do think that olive
oil can be</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t trust it i am and i&rsquo;m a
little bit</p>
<p>skeptical quite frankly about the the
polyunsaturated</p>
<p>left fat in even in olive oil
for most americans who are already have</p>
<p>a lot of omega-6 in their own fat it&rsquo;s
too high i would get it out i</p>
<p>i just cook everything in butter we just
stick with</p>
<p>uh pasture-raised butter um to cook
everything in i just don&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>oils quite frankly i don&rsquo;t trust any of
them for the</p>
<p>most part i think coconut oil is
probably the</p>
<p>safest one on the market um even coconut
oil doesn&rsquo;t give you vitamins a</p>
<p>d and k2 not like you know like butter
wood</p>
<p>i mean butter a good pasture-raised
butter is going to give you all of those</p>
<p>yeah exactly so this brings me to my
i&rsquo;ll have a lot of questions but i have</p>
<p>to withhold myself because
um we&rsquo;re going to talk you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about a lot of this at the summit
but there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>gosh there&rsquo;s well let me just quickly
answer you just ask two last questions</p>
<p>okay
when you um consume</p>
<p>mineral oil for example i know for a
fact that</p>
<p>pulls out of your liver and your body um
a lot of fat soluble vitamins because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an oil and it just kind of depletes
you i know when you</p>
<p>when someone exposes itself to mineral
oil they end up with a deficiency of</p>
<p>vitamin a vitamin d etc so my thought
was when you mentioned refined oils</p>
<p>just like refined sugar they&rsquo;ll deplete
you not just the vitamins but the fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins so i&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s
probably why because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like like a vacuum there&rsquo;s no
vitamins in there and they&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to suck
out some of the which is in your liver i</p>
<p>would imagine
that&rsquo;s one question well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry well first of all i don&rsquo;t know
what mineral oil</p>
<p>is i have to people take it as a
laxative</p>
<p>yeah but what&rsquo;s it what does it come
from i mean does it come from different</p>
<p>sources or what is it coming from eric i
think honestly i think it&rsquo;s some type of</p>
<p>it might be some type of petroleum
product i i&rsquo;ll have to find out the</p>
<p>exact ingredients but it&rsquo;s a really
refined</p>
<p>empty oil that people use as a laxative
and i actually don&rsquo;t even know for sure</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll have to find out
okay i guess i&rsquo;ve never thought about it</p>
<p>and this is what you know
every once in a while somebody throws a</p>
<p>question at me i just go like a guy
asked me about emu</p>
<p>oil the other day and i&rsquo;m i don&rsquo;t i
don&rsquo;t know you know but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>principles there that i could get to but
i&rsquo;ll have to look in you know about</p>
<p>mineral oil i just don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t really
know</p>
<p>what its source is or what it&rsquo;s made of
uh yeah</p>
<p>and so okay um so i don&rsquo;t really have an
answer for that</p>
<p>at all totally fine if i don&rsquo;t know the
answer i&rsquo;ll just tell you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m trying to learn i learn from
people</p>
<p>every day um about about this and i
don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>who i learn it from i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m just
trying to learn like</p>
<p>like you and everybody else right me too
uh and then the other question is uh</p>
<p>side question um so you have all these
people</p>
<p>that have fatty livers and there&rsquo;s quite
a few of them</p>
<p>i mean if you have a gut you have a
fatty liver and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re doing the vegetable oils
they have insulin resistance they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing sugar
and um what happens is that um</p>
<p>the vegetable oils really can disrupt
the</p>
<p>production of bile in your liver
and the release of bile i know that even</p>
<p>when i was in practice for 29 years you
the the damage that these vegetable oils</p>
<p>do to your bile ducts in the liver
as far as they become bile deficient</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t
release and a lot of that bile starts</p>
<p>backing up into the liver
and it starts to create fibrosis and</p>
<p>scar tissue
so there&rsquo;s really a lot of um you know</p>
<p>not just gall stones but just the
congested</p>
<p>colostasis where you have this uh this
stagnant</p>
<p>bile that&rsquo;s just clogging everything up
but what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting the treatment for that um
is bile salts and what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about that is that
there seems to be a really interesting</p>
<p>connection between taking that improving
eye</p>
<p>vision there&rsquo;s a vision component to
taking</p>
<p>bio salts that i&rsquo;ve looked at and the
reason i&rsquo;m bringing up is because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>an ophthalmologist i don&rsquo;t know if
you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>looked at that connection but i noticed
when i used to put my patients on</p>
<p>bile salts they would their vision would
just</p>
<p>really improve greatly and
either the mechanism it triggers the</p>
<p>vitamin a receptor in the eye
because i know it&rsquo;s an analog or it just</p>
<p>might
help you drain all the liver so you can</p>
<p>start to
have the liver function again but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting connection
between</p>
<p>the vision and your liver in biles i
don&rsquo;t know if you ever looked at that or</p>
<p>had experience with that i just wanted
to bring it up as a side note</p>
<p>yeah no you well first of all uh here
again you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken me completely off guard
and i&rsquo;m uh i didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>much about
uh the liver disease</p>
<p>uh i do know i mean with regard to
bile and bile function and how bile</p>
<p>salts my
my first reaction is is that</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re um
vegetable oils are reducing our</p>
<p>ability to first of all absorb vitamin a
and they&rsquo;re oh not only that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>vitamin a deficient
but they&rsquo;re affecting our vitamin a</p>
<p>absorption
and i&rsquo;m thinking that you know perhaps</p>
<p>the bile salts then are improving
vitamin a</p>
<p>uh absorption perhaps
and uh well i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m honestly just</p>
<p>guessing here
eric no that sounds screw it you know</p>
<p>with the with
what i do know i may be off base here</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t mind saying yeah i mean i
may be</p>
<p>uh i may be off base here but um
but you know some of my recent work you</p>
<p>know what i
for example with the eye and this</p>
<p>applies to the whole body
the world is vitamin a deficient</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just as
rampant if not more so than vit i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more
rampant than vitamin d deficiency and</p>
<p>probably
everybody who&rsquo;s looked at this at all</p>
<p>realizes that vitamin d
deficiency is extraordinary</p>
<p>in this world today and both
deficiencies are connected with almost</p>
<p>any chronic disease you can name there
are inverse</p>
<p>relationships between vitamin d
and vitamin a uh</p>
<p>and virtually every chronic disease
there is in other words as the chronic</p>
<p>disease prevalence goes up
the vitamin vitamin a and vitamin d</p>
<p>deficient or levels go down in other
words more vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>more disease and and then you know k2
comes in</p>
<p>in there as well but k2 is even much
harder to</p>
<p>as far as i know to measure and analyze
um but but you know vitamin d is easy to</p>
<p>measure
and um you know supposedly treat that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s another entire topic but i
think okay</p>
<p>but anyway i&rsquo;m thinking that you know
this this could go back to</p>
<p>it goes back to vitamin a uh absorption
perhaps</p>
<p>yeah that makes that makes sense well
anyway i just</p>
<p>really appreciate your attention your
time to do this and uh</p>
<p>um for everyone that is on um
we&rsquo;re he&rsquo;s gonna be on the the next</p>
<p>summit at the end of
august so i hope you guys um can show up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be an amazing
presentation and you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>deliver the full rundown on what you&rsquo;ve
been studying i&rsquo;m really excited to to</p>
<p>see that as well
so thank you and we&rsquo;ll be seeing you in</p>
<p>august
at the end of august and i&rsquo;ll put the</p>
<p>link down below for more information
as well as your website and your</p>
<p>information you have a foundation
as well as a lot of great data on</p>
<p>macular
uh degeneration and i&rsquo;ll put all that</p>
<p>down
below as well awesome right yeah just so</p>
<p>if i could say the
it&rsquo;s uh i i work for cure amd</p>
<p>foundation it&rsquo;s at cureamd.org
we are a 501c3 nonprofit</p>
<p>and uh so nobody in our organization
including me</p>
<p>um is compensated for anything we do
uh for this our goal is to help people</p>
<p>and to prevent vision loss
uh through ancestral diets and uh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fortunate we&rsquo;ve now reached we think
people with macular degeneration over a</p>
<p>million people
wow but we want to reach the world so</p>
<p>yeah we will hope i want to thank you
eric and thank all of your audience for</p>
<p>watching and
help spread the news because you know</p>
<p>this is a grassroots movement we&rsquo;ve all
got to do we&rsquo;re all in this together</p>
<p>the way i see it we can&rsquo;t do this
without</p>
<p>people spreading the news because that&rsquo;s
right that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at well i&rsquo;m glad i
stumbled on you so that&rsquo;s great thank</p>
<p>you so much
thank you so much eric</p>
