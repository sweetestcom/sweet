    <p>Hi friends! Today we&rsquo;re talking about value and I have to hit you where it</p>
<p>hurts with this one. This one&rsquo;s gonna suck and there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that you</p>
<p>need to hear that you don&rsquo;t want to hear. But it&rsquo;s like having a wound and you got</p>
<p>a band-aid on it. I have to rip the band-aid off so I can heal the wound, you</p>
<p>know? I gotta like fix it, but I gotta cause you a little pain first. I gotta</p>
<p>rip that fucking band-aid off and show you what you&rsquo;re doing wrong. So this</p>
<p>episode is not gonna be about loving yourself. That can be a whole podcast in</p>
<p>itself because that&rsquo;s so promoted right now in the mental health community, field,</p>
<p>social media. Every Joe Schmo is talking about how to love yourself. Little do</p>
<p>they know they have no clue what the fuck they&rsquo;re talking about. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing today. I&rsquo;m not gonna like bully all them. I&rsquo;m gonna talk about</p>
<p>value, how to feel valuable, how to see your own value, and what to do when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel valuable. So to kick this bitch off, let&rsquo;s talk about affirmations</p>
<p>for a second. So you know how everyone is telling you to like go get in the</p>
<p>mirror and tell yourself good things about yourself? And they&rsquo;re like, okay, go</p>
<p>tell yourself, I&rsquo;m pretty. I&rsquo;m valuable. If you don&rsquo;t feel that about yourself, when</p>
<p>you look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that, it&rsquo;s gonna feel like</p>
<p>a contradiction. You&rsquo;re gonna feel like shit afterward because you feel one way</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re standing in the mirror telling yourself something and it feels</p>
<p>like a lie. It doesn&rsquo;t feel good to feel lied to. So if you don&rsquo;t feel valuable,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go get in the mirror and say, I am valuable. It&rsquo;s invalidating. Something</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize about the whole affirmation shit is it makes them feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re doing something without actually having to do something. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like praying when people are like, oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll pray for you. Like</p>
<p>bitch, you just want to pretend like you&rsquo;re doing something and feel like you</p>
<p>did something. You didn&rsquo;t. So the affirmation shit, when people say, you go</p>
<p>in the mirror and you say, I&rsquo;m valuable. So you just get to walk off after that</p>
<p>and be like, well, I told myself I am. So let&rsquo;s hope it works. Maybe if I do this</p>
<p>for a week, I&rsquo;ll feel valuable when it&rsquo;s not going to happen and it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to work. And you&rsquo;re probably going to quit after day three. Cause what the</p>
<p>fuck? I&rsquo;ve been there. And the only way I can talk to you about all these things</p>
<p>that I can talk about is because I have been there. I have done all the shit that</p>
<p>people say to do, and it just hasn&rsquo;t worked. And then I&rsquo;ve had to help myself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically what my entire podcast is, is me sharing with you what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned when everything else has failed. So don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m like talking</p>
<p>down to you because bitch, I was the asshole in the mirror for a long time</p>
<p>trying to talk to myself and like tell myself I&rsquo;m valuable. Like it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking work. What you need to do instead is ask yourself, how am I</p>
<p>valuable? Start asking the question of where is my value? How am I valuable?</p>
<p>And your brain is going to have to start looking for proof of that. If you just</p>
<p>walk up to the fucking mirror and tell yourself a statement, I am valuable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no work to be done. You just told yourself a statement, whether you</p>
<p>believe it or not, and you get to go on your way. You know what I mean? But if</p>
<p>you ask the question, how am I valuable? You&rsquo;re going to start seeing it. And</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to start feeling valuable because now you see things you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see before, but you won&rsquo;t see it until you ask yourself the question. You</p>
<p>have to tell your brain what direction to think. So if you&rsquo;re in a place where</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really feel that valuable, that&rsquo;s your first step. So something</p>
<p>about me is I like external validation. I like for people to tell me I&rsquo;m cute and</p>
<p>to tell me that I&rsquo;m smart and to tell me that I&rsquo;m funny. And I didn&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t get that for so long in my life. When I went to my therapist, when I</p>
<p>was like going to counseling and shit, my counselor was always like, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need other people to tell you you&rsquo;re valuable to feel valuable. And I was like,</p>
<p>I know. Okay, cool. But I still want it. And she was like, Leo, you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>want it. And I was like, Well, I don&rsquo;t know how to not want it. Like, I know I</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t need it. But bitch, I still want it. Like I want other people to see</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m valuable. I want other people to like appreciate me. And she was like,</p>
<p>Leo, that&rsquo;s the whole fill your cup thing. Like you need to fill your own cup.</p>
<p>And I was like, bitch, I don&rsquo;t want to, like, okay, I can fill my cup. But like,</p>
<p>I still want other people to pour into my cup. Like I like the validation and so</p>
<p>many people make it a bad thing to want others to appreciate you. And I&rsquo;m over</p>
<p>here like no bitch, I want that. I want people to like me. But fighting with her</p>
<p>about that pushed me to a realization of value is just dependent on what someone</p>
<p>needs. So if you&rsquo;re looking to other people to see your value, nothing wrong</p>
<p>with it. You have no control over that because you have no control over what</p>
<p>someone wants or needs. So if you can meet a need for a person, you&rsquo;re valuable</p>
<p>to them. Or if you can help them get something that they want, or feel a way</p>
<p>that they want, you&rsquo;re valuable to them. So this is where your childhood could</p>
<p>make or break you. Like it could have really helped you or really fucked you</p>
<p>with the people around you and what they saw as valuable or not. Because if you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t able to meet needs for them in the way that they wanted, or you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to be what they wanted you to be, you were sent the message you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worthless. So let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a child that&rsquo;s born to a family that values</p>
<p>sports and athletics and they want their kid to be like a fucking football player</p>
<p>or a track star or tennis player or whatever they want. They want their kid</p>
<p>to be athletic. The parent has a need of having an athletic child. If they were</p>
<p>born a kid that is not athletic, they&rsquo;re gonna be fucking annoyed with it. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try and force it to be what they want it to be. And no matter what that</p>
<p>child does, if they&rsquo;re just not good at sports, they&rsquo;re just not good at them. You</p>
<p>know some people are just awkward with their body and they&rsquo;re not athletic. Some</p>
<p>people just can&rsquo;t do it. And that&rsquo;s not wrong or bad, that&rsquo;s just how some people</p>
<p>are. Like some people just aren&rsquo;t athletic. So this kid that&rsquo;s not good at</p>
<p>athletics is gonna constantly feel like a fuck-up to its parents because the</p>
<p>parents want a football player. And if the kid is skinny and he&rsquo;s like not that</p>
<p>athletic and he&rsquo;s not aggressive and he doesn&rsquo;t want to like go play football, he</p>
<p>can try. He can force himself to try and do what he doesn&rsquo;t like to do to make</p>
<p>his parents happy. And that&rsquo;s what you do as a toddler. Because remember my one</p>
<p>episode? I forget which one it was. I think it was Caring How People Think. I</p>
<p>told you we&rsquo;re all wired for human connection and we&rsquo;re gonna do what keeps</p>
<p>us close to others. So as a kid, if what you think is gonna gain you closeness</p>
<p>from your parents is what you&rsquo;re gonna try and do. So this kid that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>athletic is gonna go try and be athletic. It&rsquo;s gonna take so much effort from him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not ever gonna be good enough. He&rsquo;s gonna fucking hate his life and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never really gonna be that good. And he&rsquo;s gonna feel worthless to his parents</p>
<p>because all they want is that athletic kid. They don&rsquo;t care if their child is</p>
<p>artistic. They don&rsquo;t care if the kid is creative. They don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fucking math genius. What they want is an athletic child. What they got is not that.</p>
<p>So the kid could have another talent or something that they&rsquo;re really really</p>
<p>good at. And side note, every single person does have something we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>inherently good at. I&rsquo;ll make a whole video about finding your purpose because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that is. Video. I meant episode. Like a podcast. I&rsquo;ll make an</p>
<p>entire podcast about finding your purpose. If the kid can&rsquo;t meet the needs</p>
<p>the parent has, the parent is not gonna think the kid&rsquo;s valuable. At the core of</p>
<p>it. I know people don&rsquo;t like to admit that and it&rsquo;s not good to say that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like your kid or you don&rsquo;t want your kid or whatever but that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re gonna be focused at their kid. But this kid is never gonna</p>
<p>see its purpose and the reason we all feel so fucking lost is because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trained and formed into what society wants us to be or our parents. Like no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s trained and taught how to go in the direction of what they&rsquo;re naturally</p>
<p>good at. So this kid that could be very artistic is gonna be expected to be</p>
<p>athletic and he&rsquo;s not gonna be. But if your parents or the people around you</p>
<p>growing up didn&rsquo;t see what you could do and what you were good at as valuable,</p>
<p>you were never taught to see it as valuable. There are some kids that are</p>
<p>able to be what their parent wants them to be. But like I said with this kid, if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually creative but he forces himself to be athletic and spend his</p>
<p>whole life playing football, he&rsquo;s never gonna be fulfilled by it. He&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>always feel like there&rsquo;s just something wrong with him inside. He&rsquo;s always gonna</p>
<p>be unfulfilled. He&rsquo;s gonna know he doesn&rsquo;t really enjoy it that much but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just gonna know like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what feels good and it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>keep doing it I guess because I&rsquo;m good at it. When in reality you trained</p>
<p>yourself to be good at it and it&rsquo;s the thing that got you attention and</p>
<p>closeness so you&rsquo;ve been your brains been wired to like relate the feeling of</p>
<p>acceptance with doing that activity. And some people might never understand that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually not what they&rsquo;re meant to be doing. They&rsquo;re just gonna know that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking drained by what they&rsquo;re doing. They don&rsquo;t fucking like it but it</p>
<p>gets them approval and so that feels good but they don&rsquo;t understand why it</p>
<p>feels good. So they&rsquo;re just gonna think okay I guess this is just how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to go like I guess I&rsquo;ll just keep doing it because that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taught. But you&rsquo;re gonna run into a wall one day when you fucking despise</p>
<p>it and to stop doing it you&rsquo;re scared you&rsquo;re gonna lose everyone around you. So</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in a catch of like keep being miserable to be connected to</p>
<p>others or go do what I actually want to do because how many football players and</p>
<p>how many sports stars retire bitch and start doing some weird-ass shit a lot.</p>
<p>But my point with meeting the needs that your parents have they&rsquo;re the first</p>
<p>people to reflect you your value and if you were born to a parent that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want a child and they abandoned you and you&rsquo;re adopted or you were dropped off</p>
<p>at someone&rsquo;s house and you have different caretakers than your actual</p>
<p>birth parents your first signal you just got sent is that you&rsquo;re unwanted. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got major implications for what it does to your psyche even before you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of understanding what&rsquo;s going on like it fucks you up more than you</p>
<p>realize like people don&rsquo;t understand people think because the kid doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that something doesn&rsquo;t hurt them. No. They&rsquo;re subconscious and everything</p>
<p>is aware their fucking body is aware when they are abandoned their body</p>
<p>senses it their body knows their parents. There&rsquo;s not much science about this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much science about consciousness because you can&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>prove it you can&rsquo;t touch it so you can&rsquo;t experiment on it they can do what they</p>
<p>can but technology has only gotten so far like no one actually knows how bad</p>
<p>shit actually hurts you but your first signal sent to you by your parent is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re fucking worthless you&rsquo;re unwanted and they got rid of you that</p>
<p>sends you the message that you have no value because something valuable is held</p>
<p>on to versus if you were born to a mother that wanted nothing more than to</p>
<p>have a child like you wouldn&rsquo;t have to do anything special you wouldn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>be anything anything spectacular you wouldn&rsquo;t have to put effort into living</p>
<p>and like feeling like you had to earn love and earn you&rsquo;re like being seen as</p>
<p>valuable by somebody just being a child to a woman that wanted a child would</p>
<p>make you feel so valuable you would grow up feeling so loved and so important and</p>
<p>so worthy because just existing and being that child for that mother is</p>
<p>enough so it&rsquo;s just about the perspective and the needs and wants of a</p>
<p>person and your first real interaction with that is your parents and like your</p>
<p>caretakers there&rsquo;s so many more examples I can give you but one from my</p>
<p>own life is my dad is an incredible mechanic like he&rsquo;s a car salesman he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mechanic he has his own business like he&rsquo;s the best you can fucking find and</p>
<p>whenever someone can&rsquo;t fix a car they send it to him and he fixes it within a</p>
<p>few minutes like I&rsquo;m not saying this to just like hype him up like a credit I</p>
<p>give credit where it&rsquo;s due and he deserves so much fucking credit for the</p>
<p>skills and the knowledge he has like he is so fucking talented when it comes to</p>
<p>cars it&rsquo;s insane but it&rsquo;s like if my dad if what he wanted was a son to carry on</p>
<p>his business I would be perceived as a royal fuckup by him I would be perceived</p>
<p>as having no value and like I&rsquo;m worthless luckily he does not want that</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want no one to take on his business he wants it to die with him and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with that because I have no fucking interest in cars I could give</p>
<p>two shits as long as it fucking gets me from point A to point B and it&rsquo;s black</p>
<p>and it looks cute I&rsquo;m fine I know basic repairs and basic maintenance on cars</p>
<p>and shit because you can&rsquo;t not when you&rsquo;re born to someone like that but my</p>
<p>point is if my dad had the need of I want my child to carry on the business</p>
<p>my son and he was born a son that was not able to meet that need that child</p>
<p>will always feel worthless I know that&rsquo;s like a broad statement to make</p>
<p>but so much is gonna get reflected in my life that I&rsquo;m not what he wants I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>of use when I&rsquo;m not good at memorizing what car is what and when I&rsquo;m not good</p>
<p>at fixing cars and I don&rsquo;t have this just motivation to go to work with him</p>
<p>and learn about all this shit he&rsquo;s gonna focus at me with an attitude of</p>
<p>irritation and annoyance and like what the fuck is wrong with you like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to carry on my business why do you have no interest you know what I</p>
<p>mean because what I&rsquo;m good at is seeing different perspectives I have this weird</p>
<p>like ability that I just see different realities and I see shit that other</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t see so you can tell from my podcast that my brain works in a very</p>
<p>complex way I&rsquo;m very big on emotional intelligence meeting people&rsquo;s emotional</p>
<p>needs seeing people in their pain offering new perspectives solutions</p>
<p>shit like that I&rsquo;m good at being like a critical thinker and solving problems</p>
<p>that is my main fucking thing that my brain just does on its own that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like my specialty where my dad&rsquo;s specialty is cars and everything to do</p>
<p>with them mine is a lot different because my dad is not aware that human</p>
<p>beings have emotional needs like he he doesn&rsquo;t get it he doesn&rsquo;t like operate</p>
<p>like that he doesn&rsquo;t have the understanding of certain things that I</p>
<p>have a great understanding of like it&rsquo;s just so funny if you look at us because</p>
<p>if you put him and what I do he would have no fucking clue what was going on</p>
<p>and you put me and what he does and like I have no fucking clue what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like two foreign languages but me and him are both good at such different</p>
<p>things but if you&rsquo;re born to a parent and you&rsquo;re not good at what they want</p>
<p>you to be good at and you never find your thing that you&rsquo;re good at you will</p>
<p>always feel fucking worthless because that&rsquo;s the message you were sent for so</p>
<p>long by that parent like something&rsquo;s fucking wrong with you but the</p>
<p>perspective about people finding what they&rsquo;re good at and that being good or</p>
<p>bad is really just depends on who you&rsquo;re around who you were born to the</p>
<p>environment you grew up in because being good at what I&rsquo;m good at and my brain</p>
<p>working the way it does has never been seen valuable by my dad he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like get it like he appreciates my smarts and what I do and he</p>
<p>appreciates my podcast for what it is he hasn&rsquo;t listened to it but he like he</p>
<p>gets that I&rsquo;m making an impact he understands the concept of my app he</p>
<p>appreciates that I&rsquo;m doing my own thing he allows me to do it and he supports me</p>
<p>doing it but if I didn&rsquo;t have a parent like that and I had someone that was</p>
<p>trying to steer me in the direction of you need to take on my fucking business</p>
<p>fuck all this mental health shit that doesn&rsquo;t make fucking sense and I was</p>
<p>just like okay so I abandoned it all or I never even got into psychology in the</p>
<p>first place and I was just trying to force myself to learn cars I&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>fucking miserable and like I said about the football player you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>feel like you have something wrong with you it&rsquo;s not gonna be easy you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>fucking hate it you&rsquo;re gonna hate your fucking life like if I had to go work on</p>
<p>cars every day I would kill myself I would not want to fucking do that if I</p>
<p>was taught against that and I had to go run my dad&rsquo;s business I would never be</p>
<p>as good as him because that&rsquo;s something he genuinely enjoys and something that</p>
<p>he loves so when he does it he&rsquo;s extraordinary at it he&rsquo;s okay with</p>
<p>putting in the time and the effort and everything it takes to be so good at</p>
<p>what he does it would take so much more effort from me and I would never be as</p>
<p>good and if I was able to be as good it would take so much more energy from me</p>
<p>and I would hate my fucking life so being born to a parent that doesn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>what your interests or your talents are as good or like valid if you&rsquo;re born to</p>
<p>a parent that doesn&rsquo;t see that or appreciate that you&rsquo;re never gonna be</p>
<p>taught to appreciate it you&rsquo;re never gonna be taught that you are capable of</p>
<p>doing something valuable and part of the reason that I&rsquo;m so independent and smart</p>
<p>and self-sufficient and I seem like I don&rsquo;t need people is because that is</p>
<p>something my parents needed from me when I was younger they needed a kid that was</p>
<p>self-sufficient so that&rsquo;s what I had to become they needed a kid that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need them it&rsquo;s kind of like how I am with my cat like I don&rsquo;t want a fucking</p>
<p>pet that needs a lot of maintenance and don&rsquo;t fucking bother me like take care</p>
<p>of yourself let&rsquo;s hang out be fun be cute like do your thing I&rsquo;m gonna do my</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s kind of like how things were for me growing up with the adults</p>
<p>in my life not even just my parents it&rsquo;s like all adults it was like the fact</p>
<p>that I had needs was annoying and I didn&rsquo;t really feel useful of meeting</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s needs in my life and what I mean by meeting needs is like being of</p>
<p>use to them and I&rsquo;m not saying that was all the time there was so many great</p>
<p>things about my childhood and so many things I&rsquo;m thankful for but like an</p>
<p>overall theme or a consistent theme was it was annoying for me to have needs so</p>
<p>I had to adapt and learn to meet them for myself or pretend I didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>them that was like my developmental years was like just stay out of my way</p>
<p>mind your business do your thing I&rsquo;m living my life that&rsquo;s kind of how things</p>
<p>were when I was like 13 so that&rsquo;s an example of your parent having a need of</p>
<p>you not being in the way so if you are a needy kid and you aren&rsquo;t able to meet</p>
<p>the needs for yourself your parents gonna get mad at you because what they</p>
<p>want is for you to say the fuck out of their way but that bites you in the</p>
<p>fucking ass bigger than shit because when your parent wants nothing more than</p>
<p>just to be left alone because it kind of sends you the message that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have value because if someone is valuable and something worth</p>
<p>appreciating you&rsquo;d want to be around them you&rsquo;d want them in your life you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you would care to meet their needs you would care to make sure that they were</p>
<p>alright like I said I&rsquo;m gonna do a podcast about finding your purpose but I</p>
<p>have a journal prompt in my app so like a bunch of questions to ask yourself</p>
<p>that is gonna help you see your value my app is called positive focus and the</p>
<p>prompt that I&rsquo;m talking about is labeled find your purpose so the questions in</p>
<p>that are gonna help you see the way you can offer value to others it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>gonna help you see yourself in a different light and it will totally make</p>
<p>you see shit about yourself that you did not even see was valuable you&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help you a lot but it will also help you get closer to finding out what your</p>
<p>purpose is so it&rsquo;s good for both things but it&rsquo;s really really good for seeing</p>
<p>your value because the perspectives I shared in that and the questions that I</p>
<p>put in that are what I learned to get where I am now to go from not</p>
<p>appreciating anything about myself to seeing things to appreciate like</p>
<p>thinking I had nothing to fucking like offer that was valuable to feeling</p>
<p>valuable and not even just to offer like just being like my analogy of being born</p>
<p>to the mom that just wants the child just to have a child like to just have</p>
<p>that unwavering unconditional appreciation for something I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I had anything that was worth appreciating so definitely check that</p>
<p>out if it sounds like something you&rsquo;re interested in I&rsquo;ll put the link to my</p>
<p>app in the description of this podcast or if you want to search it in the App</p>
<p>Store it&rsquo;s in the Apple App Store and Google Play it&rsquo;s called positive focus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the blue eye that&rsquo;s what the icon is it&rsquo;s a blue eyeball so get it if</p>
<p>you want it and let me know what you think I really hope you like it</p>
<p>okay so like I said value depends on needs what someone wants and needs I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna give you another example hookups if you are going to meet someone for a</p>
<p>hookup and that person is only looking to get their dick wet that is all they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see about you so when you go hang out and you go fuck them because you</p>
<p>wanted to hook up you go fuck them and then you leave and then you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>why is this person not acting like I&rsquo;m God&rsquo;s gift of fucking earth especially</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re a little bit uglier than you you&rsquo;re gonna be wondering like why the</p>
<p>fuck are they not chasing me I&rsquo;m the best thing that just happened to them</p>
<p>why are they not like trying to eat my ass every fucking day it&rsquo;s because all</p>
<p>they wanted was to get off they were not looking at you for the other things that</p>
<p>were valuable about you so they didn&rsquo;t see any like they were just looking to</p>
<p>get off you were an object to them so this will completely fuck your sense of</p>
<p>like value and self-esteem if you let it because if you let an ugly motherfucker</p>
<p>like hook up with you and then they don&rsquo;t chase you around afterward and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re secretly hoping they will and then they don&rsquo;t oh my god you have to</p>
<p>realize what that person was looking for and what they needed was to get off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they wanted that&rsquo;s all they were gonna see they were gonna see you</p>
<p>were hot and you were good enough to do a job you did it you&rsquo;re gone you met</p>
<p>that need okay you were valuable for that now if you&rsquo;re secretly hoping</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll like see how great you were and then want a relationship with you or</p>
<p>pursue you more or want to do this that and the other they&rsquo;re not going to they</p>
<p>did not see anything else about you besides the fact that you were something</p>
<p>to get off on they were not looking for how you were a genuine person or how you</p>
<p>were considerate or how you were sweet or looking at how you were smart and how</p>
<p>your brain worked and any other fucking thing that could make you like feel</p>
<p>valuable they were not looking for it so they did not see it they did not care</p>
<p>and that will leave you feeling like you have no fucking value and like you</p>
<p>really aren&rsquo;t that special if you look at that experience like that like I said</p>
<p>my dad&rsquo;s good at cars and I&rsquo;m good at emotional shit so it depends on who</p>
<p>needs what if someone breaks down on the side of the road I am useless to them I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m good to hang out I can like help protect you but I&rsquo;m not gonna fix</p>
<p>your problem my dad is the one to call my dad is the motherfucker that will</p>
<p>fix your car and get you on the road what you need is your car fixed he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>guy that can do it he&rsquo;s valuable to you in that moment I&rsquo;m worthless but if</p>
<p>someone is going through something and they need emotional needs met I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>motherfucker to call my dad is useless it&rsquo;s just about who needs you but someone</p>
<p>with their car broken down on the side of the road is not gonna give a fuck who</p>
<p>comes by if they&rsquo;re not a mechanic like they&rsquo;re not gonna be looking for their</p>
<p>next partner or someone that could be there for them emotionally or someone</p>
<p>that was so great or this and that because the problem they&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>and the problem that they have is that their car is broken down they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for a way to fix it they&rsquo;re blind to anything else most people but what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re focused on is not me like they&rsquo;re they want a mechanic they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good I am and how gifted I am at psychology and like being</p>
<p>there for people and seeing different realities it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not focused on it like with the hookup thing it doesn&rsquo;t matter how great</p>
<p>you are if the person just wants to fuck that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re gonna see is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re something to fuck they&rsquo;re not gonna see oh you could potentially be a</p>
<p>great partner that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re looking for when they go looking for a</p>
<p>partner then they might think of you and be like oh well that bitch had all this</p>
<p>this and that so maybe I should hit her up you know but they&rsquo;re not gonna realize</p>
<p>it in the moment when they&rsquo;re focused on one need if you&rsquo;re faced with</p>
<p>situations where you are not the one people ever need you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>worthless that&rsquo;s why it is so important to figure out what the fuck you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>at or to use any skills you do have to be able to provide value to others and</p>
<p>to help other people that&rsquo;s where your self-esteem is gonna come from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where your sense of value is gonna come from because if you don&rsquo;t know the way</p>
<p>that you can help you&rsquo;re not gonna help and people are not gonna know to reach</p>
<p>out to you or ask you for anything and you&rsquo;re gonna feel fucking worthless but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t always have to contribute to be valuable because like I said remember</p>
<p>if you were born to a woman that just wanted nothing more than to be a mother</p>
<p>any child she had would have been valuable to her so you don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>doing things to feel valuable but that&rsquo;s just one way you can get that feeling</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s two ways to go about it but the one in your control is</p>
<p>what you can do for others and what you can provide so since I just brought up</p>
<p>the whole hookup analogy it takes someone of value to recognize value in</p>
<p>someone else so if they don&rsquo;t have it in them they&rsquo;re not gonna fucking see it in</p>
<p>you an example of this is basic like consideration when you meet somebody or</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested you&rsquo;re gonna date if someone is inconsiderate they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna see the fact that you&rsquo;re considerate as valuable they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna give a fuck and they&rsquo;re gonna leave you on read and be rude and like</p>
<p>flake on plans and be just really inconsiderate someone that is</p>
<p>considerate will appreciate the fact that you are considerate because they</p>
<p>have it and they can see it and can appreciate it so use that as kind of</p>
<p>like a reference when you don&rsquo;t feel valuable to somebody let that be a red</p>
<p>fucking flag to look at them a little bit closer and see what they lack</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re not seeing the value in you they don&rsquo;t have the same things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to contribute and offer and them so don&rsquo;t get caught up with</p>
<p>trying to figure out why you&rsquo;re not good enough why they don&rsquo;t like you hold the</p>
<p>fuck on for a second and look at hey maybe I might not like them maybe they</p>
<p>might actually not be shit because someone of value is gonna see your value</p>
<p>and make you feel valuable so don&rsquo;t attack yourself don&rsquo;t try to beat</p>
<p>yourself up and figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with you nothing they don&rsquo;t value the</p>
<p>thing that you have and that&rsquo;s okay not everybody&rsquo;s going to but there are</p>
<p>people that will and the people that will value what you have will value it</p>
<p>so much fucking more than the people you have to convince to value you and if you</p>
<p>are questioning your value I&rsquo;m sorry because that means that you&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>through your life where people have not reflected it to you or you&rsquo;ve lined up</p>
<p>with a lot of fucking people that don&rsquo;t value what you have to offer and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here to tell you it does not mean you have nothing to offer it does not mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worthless you just been around the wrong motherfuckers for way too long</p>
<p>so start looking for the things that reflect your value and I am gonna make</p>
<p>fun of social media really quick and make you aware of just one extra thing</p>
<p>is social media is not the place to do it because social media reflects only</p>
<p>one type of value mainly and it&rsquo;s the way that you look or is how much money</p>
<p>you have don&rsquo;t get too caught up and letting that be your only source of</p>
<p>like reflection of your value because it&rsquo;s skewed and fucked up but it does</p>
<p>feel good sometimes so this next example I&rsquo;m about to give you is something that</p>
<p>ties in all the points I&rsquo;m trying to make with this episode pretty much and I</p>
<p>really like it it&rsquo;s kind of wacky but me and my sister came up with it a couple</p>
<p>of months ago and I think it&rsquo;s fucking perfect so here it is so let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in Walmart and someone left their Birkin on one of the shelves if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what a Birkin is it is one of the most expensive handbags in the world so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s a fucking black crocodile Birkin on the shelf they&rsquo;re around a</p>
<p>hundred grand if you&rsquo;re in Walmart chances are a lot of people are gonna be</p>
<p>walking by that bag and have no fucking clue what it is they&rsquo;re not gonna give</p>
<p>it a second glance when they walk by it on the shelf they&rsquo;re not really gonna</p>
<p>look at it they&rsquo;re not gonna pay attention they&rsquo;re not really gonna give</p>
<p>a fuck but if I&rsquo;m in Walmart and I walk by that bag and I see it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>motherfucking crocodile Birkin I am NOT leaving that store without it I&rsquo;m stealing</p>
<p>that motherfucker I sure am I would most likely look in the wallet and get the ID</p>
<p>and find whose purse it is if I can give it to them but I&rsquo;m still taking that</p>
<p>purse even if I take it and like go home with it I&rsquo;m still gonna have it for a</p>
<p>couple days and just play with it while I find out who the owner is you know</p>
<p>bitch but my point is people in Walmart that are walking around have no fucking</p>
<p>clue what a Birkin is most of them they don&rsquo;t understand that there is a</p>
<p>hundred-thousand-dollar bag sitting on the shelf it takes someone with certain</p>
<p>awareness of something&rsquo;s value to be able to recognize it because everyone</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t understand that&rsquo;s a Birkin is not gonna look twice at it me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>stealing it so let&rsquo;s go into the perspective of the Birkin let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the Birkin sitting on the shelf and you know you are $100,000 and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching all these people walk by you and not even like look at you twice</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not giving you the time of day they don&rsquo;t even give a fuck that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>there they&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re nobody if you&rsquo;re someone that feels very</p>
<p>valuable and you know your value and you&rsquo;re surrounded by people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see it you&rsquo;re gonna question it so if you&rsquo;re the Birkin you&rsquo;re gonna be like</p>
<p>man what the fuck like I&rsquo;m crocodile like I&rsquo;m a crocodile Birkin I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>leather one like I&rsquo;m not 10 grand I&rsquo;m a hundred grand I&rsquo;m a fucking crocodile</p>
<p>Birkin and people are not even looking at me what the hell like you will sit</p>
<p>there and you&rsquo;ll start getting dust on you because people just are not picking</p>
<p>you up they&rsquo;re not like understanding what&rsquo;s in front of them because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not meant to be in Walmart you&rsquo;re not meant to fucking be there you are meant</p>
<p>to be at a mall you are meant to be in the fucking Hermes store you are meant</p>
<p>to be where people can see your value so get the fuck out of Walmart if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>a place where no one is recognizing your value leave go to where you can be</p>
<p>recognized now let&rsquo;s talk about if someone that doesn&rsquo;t understand that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Birkin just takes the bag they think it&rsquo;s a little $50 purse and they</p>
<p>fucking go home with it they&rsquo;re gonna trash it they&rsquo;re gonna fucking throw it</p>
<p>around in the car they&rsquo;re gonna throw it around in the house they&rsquo;re not gonna be</p>
<p>gentle with they&rsquo;re gonna set it on the floor when they go to a restaurant like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna beat the bag up and not give a fuck they&rsquo;re gonna mistreat</p>
<p>it because they don&rsquo;t know what the value is and if you are the Birkin I</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s an inanimate object but like here the example out if you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>Birkin you&rsquo;re gonna be being mistreated by this person like what the fuck like I</p>
<p>am $100,000 and you are treating me like I am fucking $5 and human beings in the</p>
<p>position of being the Birkin which is what you are you&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>questioning your value and people treating you like your average long</p>
<p>enough will make you believe your average so this Birkin will get beat the</p>
<p>fuck up this beautiful $100,000 crocodile Birkin will be fucking</p>
<p>demolished by the person that does not appreciate it and understand the value</p>
<p>in it versus if I walked in that fucking Walmart and I found that Birkin bitch I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking it home and putting it in a dust bag I&rsquo;m putting it on the top of my</p>
<p>closet I&rsquo;m fucking taking care of it I&rsquo;m babying it I&rsquo;m wiping any speck of dust</p>
<p>off of it I&rsquo;m not letting people touch it no one can hold it without a glove</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna baby the fuck out of it and treat it so valuable because I see</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s valuable but when it comes to people seeing your value if you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>Birkin in Walmart so if you are something of high value in a place where</p>
<p>people are not seeing the value the chances of someone walking in and</p>
<p>understanding that you&rsquo;re valuable are low it&rsquo;s not zero because I go to</p>
<p>Walmart sometimes bitch if I saw a Birkin and I saw your value I would</p>
<p>snatch you I would literally steal you in 2.5 seconds so there&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>chance for someone to see your value but you need to put yourself in the</p>
<p>positions where it can happen more often like I said the Birkin needs to be at</p>
<p>the mall because it will always feel valuable in that place because there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be surrounded by people that recognize and know the value of it so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never no hope no matter where you are like even the Birkin in Walmart</p>
<p>put the motherfucker in Dollar Tree the chances are slimmer but someone still</p>
<p>might walk in there and see the value because I go to Dollar Tree I do want to</p>
<p>point out that there are so many little things that are valuable about yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d overlook on a daily basis so one of the best things you can do is</p>
<p>look at yourself like you&rsquo;re meeting yourself for the first time what would</p>
<p>you appreciate about yourself if you were gonna be friends with you what</p>
<p>would you appreciate about yourself like what little things and what little quirks</p>
<p>do you have where you&rsquo;d be like oh my god I would think that was so cute or I</p>
<p>would love this so much if I found this in someone else and then do it from a</p>
<p>relationship standpoint so do it from like you&rsquo;re dating yourself and look at</p>
<p>all the little things that you would love to date someone that has these</p>
<p>things that you have and trying to look for how you&rsquo;re valuable and things to</p>
<p>appreciate about yourself will make you see the value and then once you see the</p>
<p>value you can&rsquo;t not feel valuable anymore but I do need to give you a big</p>
<p>fat fucking warning and it is about realizing your value because if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lived so long of your life not seeing certain things about yourself as</p>
<p>valuable and feeling kind of like worthless when you become aware of the</p>
<p>ways that you are valuable everything in your life will have to change and I mean</p>
<p>everything so if you start realizing you actually are a lot more valuable than</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve thought and there&rsquo;s so many little things about yourself and you</p>
<p>appreciate so many things now if you&rsquo;re dating someone that treats you like shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna become a lot harder to stay with them like I said it&rsquo;s all fun and</p>
<p>games until you gain awareness it&rsquo;s gonna now be miserable to be with this</p>
<p>person you&rsquo;re gonna be like why the fuck are you treating me like that but all</p>
<p>that happened was the mindset shift of you became aware of your value so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna turn on that person no one knows you just had this revelation about all</p>
<p>the things that you now see about yourself as valuable so your partner&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna know anything has changed so the way that they&rsquo;ve been treating you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been tolerating there you&rsquo;re gonna expect them to change it</p>
<p>now and they&rsquo;re gonna be like what the fuck that&rsquo;s one of the warnings another</p>
<p>one is your job another one is your friendships another one is your family</p>
<p>anyone around you that treats you anything less than what you now feel</p>
<p>worth you&rsquo;re gonna fucking hate and you&rsquo;re gonna have to get away from so</p>
<p>this comes with a price you have to be willing to pay the price of changing</p>
<p>your entire life if you&rsquo;re gonna start going down the route of trying to value</p>
<p>yourself and see your value you&rsquo;re gonna realize that you were the hundred</p>
<p>thousand dollar Birkin that went home with a crackhead and now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>throwing you around and beating you to shit they&rsquo;re not seeing the value in you</p>
<p>and now once you realize that and you&rsquo;re like fuck no I should be at the mall</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to go to the mall you&rsquo;re gonna have to leave these</p>
<p>relationships and get away from these people that are treating you like shit</p>
<p>but like I said you&rsquo;re not aware that you&rsquo;re being treated like shit right now</p>
<p>once you start questioning things is what you&rsquo;re gonna realize yo I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>treated like ass that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t value myself because I&rsquo;m around so-and-so</p>
<p>and they treat me like this and I&rsquo;ve thought this was just okay and normal</p>
<p>and I thought I deserved this you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot more picky with the way</p>
<p>that people talk to you you&rsquo;re gonna start wanting to smack the fuck out of</p>
<p>some people and trust me I&rsquo;ve been there I&rsquo;ve smacked the fuck out of plenty of</p>
<p>people in my day and I will continue to do so like bitch I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about how spiritual or how aware that I get sometimes a motherfucker just needs</p>
<p>to be hit sometimes the violence is the only answer sorry it&rsquo;s the truth so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do start doing all this then you&rsquo;re gonna get to the point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like okay for me to value myself and choose myself and see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>valuable about myself I have to be alone you&rsquo;re gonna realize everyone around you</p>
<p>is not worth you or has not been treating you how you&rsquo;re worth and if</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t decide to like treat you better then you&rsquo;re gonna want to say the</p>
<p>fuck away from them so then you&rsquo;re gonna get into the internal conflict and this</p>
<p>is something no one fucking tells you about and no one warns you about but I</p>
<p>will you might start resenting yourself and that&rsquo;s normal because you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be like god damn it like why can&rsquo;t I just tolerate being treated like shit</p>
<p>anymore because now I have to be alone like picking myself and valuing myself</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m alone now I have nobody but like I said in order for you to go back into</p>
<p>the way that you were treated before it&rsquo;s gonna feel like shit so now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel stuck in a situation where you&rsquo;re like I&rsquo;m alone and I feel like</p>
<p>shit or I can go be with the people that I know and feel like shit it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>which feel like shit do I want to choose and I&rsquo;m here to tell you that there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>extra option it&rsquo;s to go find people that will value you go to the mall if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the Birkin go to the mall that&rsquo;s where all the people are that will value</p>
<p>you so when you start realizing all these things about yourself that are</p>
<p>valuable and you see all the ways that you can be of use go be around the</p>
<p>people you are of use to go find them they&rsquo;re looking for you just like all of</p>
<p>you were looking for someone real and someone who was gonna tell you the</p>
<p>fucking way it is you were looking for me and the people that need you are</p>
<p>looking for you trust me you just have to go find them get creative start</p>
<p>thinking of all the people you could be of use to</p>
<p>so remember when I said I&rsquo;m gonna hit you where it hurts this is where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do that so if anything I&rsquo;ve already said so far has hurt you put on</p>
<p>your seatbelt bitch because this is the part that&rsquo;s actually gonna like hit you</p>
<p>it needs to so remember when I talked about affirmations and telling yourself</p>
<p>in the mirror I&rsquo;m valuable you can&rsquo;t tell yourself that you&rsquo;re valuable and</p>
<p>continue to do things that are not in line with your value so when I said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to make major life changes you are so if you start realizing</p>
<p>these valuable things about yourself you have to stop doing the things that</p>
<p>devalue you the biggest example is giving people access to you that should</p>
<p>not have access to you that are not of caliber and are not of quality you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fuck around anymore you can&rsquo;t be fucking every Joe Schmoe you want just because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re horny you have to start holding yourself to a certain standard because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worth a lot and when you become aware of what you&rsquo;re worth it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a burden because you have to take care of this little treasure and there is</p>
<p>treasure in you and once you become aware of it now you have to take care of</p>
<p>it so you can&rsquo;t just go be given it to every Joe fucking Schmoe your standards</p>
<p>are gonna have to remain solid there&rsquo;s no more bending in your boundaries</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more oh I&rsquo;m horny I&rsquo;ll go fuck the little five out of ten because</p>
<p>I just want to no you&rsquo;re gonna have to learn to control your emotions you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to learn how to get yourself under wraps and stop devaluing yourself</p>
<p>with your actions the way you eat is gonna have to change you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>yourself you value yourself and eat like shit and put bad things into you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to start exercising taking care of your health you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to get your finances in check you&rsquo;re not stop being reckless like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that come with valuing yourself that you have no idea</p>
<p>and this is just gonna happen naturally it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>consciously choose to do this but this shit&rsquo;s just gonna happen especially the</p>
<p>way that people talk to you you&rsquo;re gonna be a lot more sensitive to disrespect</p>
<p>because now you feel of worth of something that can be disrespected you</p>
<p>feel like you deserve respect once you realize your value so the way people</p>
<p>talk to you is gonna have to change the way you talk to yourself is gonna have</p>
<p>to change the job you do is gonna have to change the pride you take in your</p>
<p>appearance will change you will put more effort into the way that you look and</p>
<p>the way that you dress that&rsquo;s valuing yourself that&rsquo;s what no one wants to</p>
<p>fucking talk about but that&rsquo;s the truth and to tell yourself I value myself and</p>
<p>then go do the opposite of what someone would do that would value their self</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking lying to yourself but don&rsquo;t worry because like I said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gonna happen naturally upon realizing your value because as soon as</p>
<p>you see something as valuable you treat it accordingly that&rsquo;s just the way that</p>
<p>your brain is that&rsquo;s the way that human beings are so really prepare for your</p>
<p>life to shift and if you&rsquo;ve been trying to lose weight or if you&rsquo;ve been trying</p>
<p>to respect yourself and watch the way people talk to you if there&rsquo;s been these</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve been wanting to do and it just seems so difficult this is</p>
<p>the shortcut seeing your value is what&rsquo;s gonna make it so much easier because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna feel natural to eat what&rsquo;s good for you and to exercise and to care</p>
<p>about the way that you look and to make motherfuckers watch their mouth when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re around you it&rsquo;s just gonna come natural so it&rsquo;s gonna feel like a lot</p>
<p>less effort to take care of yourself and to do all these things that you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>wanting to do for so long so if you want to tell yourself I value myself</p>
<p>motherfucker you need to be someone of value you need to act someone of value</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to just throw that affirmation around I am valuable in the</p>
<p>mirror and not do any actions to back that up and all of this compounds so the</p>
<p>more that you take care of yourself the more you&rsquo;re gonna feel valuable and the</p>
<p>more you&rsquo;re gonna care about yourself because you only care about what you</p>
<p>invest in and when it starts to become natural and easy to invest in yourself</p>
<p>because you see your value it&rsquo;s gonna compound because the more you invest the</p>
<p>more you care so it&rsquo;s your sense of self is just gonna get stronger and stronger</p>
<p>your sense of value is just gonna get stronger and stronger and the shit that</p>
<p>you will and won&rsquo;t put up with will change you will stop putting up with a</p>
<p>lot of bullshit so an example I have of this and stick</p>
<p>into your boundaries and your shit like that when you go to a club and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cover charge so if you go to a club and it&rsquo;s ten bucks to get in what happens if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t pay the ten bucks you don&rsquo;t get in so you come correct you pay what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to or you don&rsquo;t fucking get in the club doesn&rsquo;t care who you are</p>
<p>you are the bouncer at the door you get to set what it costs to access you so if</p>
<p>you say basic consideration skills and basic communication are what it costs to</p>
<p>get access to me people can pay it or they can fuck off they&rsquo;re not getting in</p>
<p>the club they&rsquo;re not getting access to you you&rsquo;re gonna feel a lot more</p>
<p>confident and you&rsquo;re gonna feel a lot more justified in setting boundaries once</p>
<p>you realize your value and it will make you stick to them because why the fuck</p>
<p>would a club let someone in that can&rsquo;t afford the $10 like if you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>offering the service of having a good time pay to get in so if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>offer all the value that you have to someone pay what I say to have access to</p>
<p>it and if you can&rsquo;t afford it fuck off politely like if you can&rsquo;t come at me</p>
<p>with basic communication and consideration you&rsquo;re not getting access</p>
<p>to me I don&rsquo;t mean it to be this aggressive but like get the fuck away</p>
<p>from me what did you think you were playing with bitch but that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>is a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize what they have in front of them so they</p>
<p>mistreat it so that&rsquo;s how I am now I&rsquo;m like if you don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s in front of</p>
<p>you get the fuck away from me I don&rsquo;t know who you thought you were playing</p>
<p>with but it&rsquo;s not me so with this you will be a lot quicker to cut people off</p>
<p>and you were gonna feel a lot more justified in having boundaries because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna realize something of value does not deserve to be fucked with and</p>
<p>as soon as you see yourself as something to value good luck everybody that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t treat it accordingly but like I said you&rsquo;re the bouncer at the door so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to clock out you constantly have to assess every single</p>
<p>person that is trying to come into your life you&rsquo;re the bouncer you&rsquo;re who boots</p>
<p>people to fuck out you are the person that says okay are you able to afford</p>
<p>what it costs to access me or are you not it&rsquo;s not just a one-time thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do this forever and it&rsquo;s fine and it&rsquo;s kind of fun and it</p>
<p>gets way easier because when a bouncer first starts working at a club they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not confident enough to just throw someone the fuck out and be mean like</p>
<p>that comes with time so the more you do it the easier it gets and the better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get at it and I&rsquo;m not saying be mean to someone that doesn&rsquo;t see your</p>
<p>value because if they don&rsquo;t see your value and they&rsquo;re not treating you</p>
<p>accordingly they&rsquo;re not gonna understand that anything is wrong so if</p>
<p>you just start attacking them you&rsquo;re the asshole in their eyes so politely</p>
<p>decline tell them to get the fuck away and move on if they disrespect you cuss</p>
<p>them the fuck out let me actually in the podcast on that so I hope this one was</p>
<p>helpful I know I said a lot of shit that could have hurt your feelings but I want</p>
<p>you to all know anything I ever say is with love and I&rsquo;m trying to help I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never trying to hurt you if I&rsquo;m trying to hurt you you&rsquo;ll fucking know I will</p>
<p>link my app and my social media and all the other shit that I have and things</p>
<p>you could check out in the description of this if you did like this episode</p>
<p>leave my podcast the rating like a five-star rating nothing less than that</p>
<p>please but I hope you enjoyed it I hope you take something away from this and I</p>
<p>will talk to you next Sunday</p>
