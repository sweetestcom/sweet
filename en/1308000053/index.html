    <p>Only sacks can lose 20 pounds and look worse.</p>
<p>Sacks, you know, with with all with all these gains and all your funds,</p>
<p>I would really love for you to cash them out and buy a belt.</p>
<p>Ask your wife or your house manager to help you find slim fit shirts at the local Macy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You literally look like you&rsquo;re wearing a parachute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never I&rsquo;ve never worn some fit anything.</p>
<p>Stand up for a second. Stand up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not wearing pants.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Can somebody call HR? Are you really not wearing pants?</p>
<p>I got now I got I got shorts on.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Are you really wearing shorts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s lying.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Put your leg up.</p>
<p>Show us that pasty leg.</p>
<p>No fucking way.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. How big are those shorts?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like Dom DeLuise and he lost a hundred pounds.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t change his wardrobe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re rich, dude.</p>
<p>Change your wardrobe.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Those are like two toothpicks sticking out of a tent.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like somebody set up a circus tent and didn&rsquo;t tie down the ends.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s wearing a parachute and a circus tent.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>With us today, again, the podcast.</p>
<p>With us again today, the dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya and the queen of quinoa,</p>
<p>David Friedberg, in front of some bad art.</p>
<p>And from the mausoleum, a svelte, fighting weight, minus 20 pounds, the rain man himself,</p>
<p>David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>You guys gave me the motivation.</p>
<p>I mean, this podcast.</p>
<p>We fat shamed you.</p>
<p>You fat shamed me.</p>
<p>You needled me for months.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to lose the weight.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve lost it.</p>
<p>What was your peak weight in the last 12 months?</p>
<p>I think I was at in the high 190s and I&rsquo;m down to about 172 now.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s about 25 pounds.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Since about April or May.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really great, bro.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, your family thanks you.</p>
<p>I thank you as a friend too.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, that&rsquo;s really fucking great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of you.</p>
<p>Are you exercising too?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Or you just cut your diet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m doing the same exercise regimen I was doing before, which is just running occasionally,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frankly severe calorie restriction.</p>
<p>And your Munich product has been very helpful.</p>
<p>But is it really severe calorie restriction?</p>
<p>Thanks for the plug.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>We were talking about Munich for the syndicate on the call-in app the other day.</p>
<p>These fucking plugs are dropping from the sky.</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowed to plug another Betsy&rsquo;s product.</p>
<p>You just did the Munich plug so you could put a call-in plug in your head.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re violating a rules of the road that we wrote down.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a violation of the rules because I&rsquo;m not a shareholder in Munich.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any interest in that.</p>
<p>But are you negotiating a deal?</p>
<p>No, but now I might.</p>
<p>Have you talked about funding Munich?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But Freebird, can I invest?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>We should actually throw that one in the syndicate if you guys want.</p>
<p>Yeah, Munich&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I lost some weight on it.</p>
<p>Saksipu, what&rsquo;s your basal calorie burn?</p>
<p>Did you calculate that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Like your steady state calorie burn on a normal day.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not exercising or whatever.</p>
<p>Like based on your height, your BMI, your weight, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I did look it up.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s around 2000 calories a day.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a calculator online where you can enter your height, weight, and age.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll tell you how many calories that you burn every day.</p>
<p>So if you want to lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>Everything else that people do around weight loss that is not that is basically some sort of game.</p>
<p>You just have to consume fewer calories than you&rsquo;re burning.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s really interesting about that calculator is that</p>
<p>the number of calories you can burn every year actually changes as you get older.</p>
<p>It goes down.</p>
<p>So the reason why people gain weight as they get older</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re in a habit of consuming a certain number of calories every day.</p>
<p>But as you get older, like every year, you can consume say 50 fewer calories a day,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>And that basically becomes fat if you consume at the same level.</p>
<p>So you have to cut your consumption down as you get older or you will gain weight.</p>
<p>And in addition to your metabolic fitness,</p>
<p>meaning like having your exercise levels stay up to increase your metabolism overall,</p>
<p>you can also add muscle mass.</p>
<p>A lot of people lose muscle mass over time.</p>
<p>Muscle burns more calories per day just to kind of keep functioning.</p>
<p>So the more muscle mass you have, the higher your basal&hellip;</p>
<p>And you lose like half a pound to a pound a year after 40.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Directionally free?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that sounds about right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I read.</p>
<p>That is about right.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because this dynamic where people are just consuming the same amount,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t realize that they can&rsquo;t burn it.</p>
<p>And so it becomes fat.</p>
<p>You know, so to my case, first of all, you got to get your caloric intake down to 2000</p>
<p>just to get to steady state.</p>
<p>And that can be a challenge.</p>
<p>But if you really want to lose weight, you need to burn,</p>
<p>you need to basically consume a few hundred calories less than that.</p>
<p>And if you can consume 500 calories less than that per day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered rapid weight loss.</p>
<p>And then you can actually see the results, which is very motivating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I like the idea of just going for the like significant, the 500 calories.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at 1500 calories a day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t like precisely measured it out, but I&rsquo;ve been trying to go for.</p>
<p>And is that you skip a meal?</p>
<p>Is that how you get to the minus 500 calories?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I will either skip breakfast or I&rsquo;ll do a very light breakfast.</p>
<p>And then for lunch, I&rsquo;ll do like something entirely plant based, like,</p>
<p>like suit, like a vegetable soup of some kind.</p>
<p>And then when it comes to dinner, it&rsquo;ll be a more normal dinner, but no carbs.</p>
<p>No two dinners, one bottle of wine.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>You have a good system.</p>
<p>The SAC system is vegetables first.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then fish, then poultry, then red meat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not like entirely all one thing or another.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like all vegan, which would be hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re all, there&rsquo;s no red meat or something like that.</p>
<p>You can do a little of everything, but you have to have a weighting.</p>
<p>And the weighting is based on what foods are the most calorie dense.</p>
<p>So the mistake that I think people make, and I think it&rsquo;s one of these trick diets is like</p>
<p>with these protein, like the South beach type diet or the paleo diet, right?</p>
<p>Where they&rsquo;re trying to trick their body into ketosis and all they do is eat a lot of red meat.</p>
<p>But those steaks have a lot of calories in them.</p>
<p>So it only works if you do it perfectly, where you totally trick your body and</p>
<p>keeping your body in ketosis forever is just not sustainable in my view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re a lot better off just eating less calorie dense food and steak is very calorie</p>
<p>dense.</p>
<p>So, you know, again, you try to eat less first than fish.</p>
<p>I rarely eat beef, but I get to eat it today.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m having steak night.</p>
<p>Dre&rsquo;s coming over for dinner.</p>
<p>And in the season, he, whenever I text him and I say, Hey, what do you want for dinner?</p>
<p>Draymond&rsquo;s always like fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.</p>
<p>And I said, bro, I, I get to eat steak so fucking rarely.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re having steak.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>My mouth is watering.</p>
<p>When you get to, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re on some diet, basically.</p>
<p>No, no, I do.</p>
<p>I just observed that I don&rsquo;t eat meat.</p>
<p>Any more than once a week, maximum.</p>
<p>And right now I&rsquo;m probably averaging once every two weeks, maybe even once every three</p>
<p>weeks.</p>
<p>And to your point, it&rsquo;s much better.</p>
<p>I do these scans, you know, you can do these kind of body scans to know what your, your</p>
<p>total water weight, your total muscle weight, your total weight, your total body fat, all</p>
<p>of that stuff.</p>
<p>And your basic metabolic rate.</p>
<p>And I just kind of track it like once a quarter just to see where it is.</p>
<p>And I, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve really found that I can&rsquo;t eat red meat anymore.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, it just really fucks me up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>The other, one other trick is that you should never consume calories like in liquid form,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You should only be drinking water, tea, coffee, things like that, that don&rsquo;t have any calories.</p>
<p>People go to Starbucks in the morning and they drink like 400 plus calories.</p>
<p>Then they have a, you know, cinnamon roll or whatever, or banana.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re at 1200 at the start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going to be gaining weight on just from going to Starbucks in the morning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, now if you do an Americano with a splash of almond milk or something, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like five, 10 calories, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But, um, you, you have to stop drinking calories.</p>
<p>And then the one exception is like last night we did poker, we were drinking wine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Cause I thought the wine was shit.</p>
<p>I thought the whole game was horrible.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you all the things that were wrong.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Number one, I fucking came all the way up to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Chamath normally hosts.</p>
<p>Saks went over the top and Chamath is tilted.</p>
<p>Over the top in air quotes.</p>
<p>Number one, nobody arrived on time because nobody respects you enough to show up on time.</p>
<p>J Cal and I played heads up for an hour before anyone else showed up.</p>
<p>We were there from seven to eight just playing heads up.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>I took all the free Berks money.</p>
<p>I own 3% of Munich.</p>
<p>You, as the host didn&rsquo;t show up till nine 30 and you spent all of the time on the phone</p>
<p>outside in the room, trading Japanese bonds or doing whatever you were doing.</p>
<p>Talking to Peter showed up at 10 30.</p>
<p>You know, the game was basically randomly in the mock half the night.</p>
<p>Nobody was observing any good decorum run at once, run it twice.</p>
<p>There was just nothing going on.</p>
<p>You had stale fish.</p>
<p>OK, just sitting there rotting, stinking up the whole fucking room.</p>
<p>You know, you had 2013 cold, which is not even a good year.</p>
<p>Just FYI.</p>
<p>OK, 2012.</p>
<p>OK, 2015.</p>
<p>I mean, so anyways, I thought it was a disaster.</p>
<p>I stormed up and I left.</p>
<p>He did rage quit and it was quite a moment because we&rsquo;re playing PLO.</p>
<p>Finally, Saks loses all his money.</p>
<p>But I did have three bowls of ice cream, which I regretted this morning.</p>
<p>All right, Saks, in your defense, why were you?</p>
<p>Why did you leave your guests for three hours while you talked at your own home?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t three hours.</p>
<p>You guys were being well attended to.</p>
<p>I made sure that you were well attended to.</p>
<p>And then I had to duck out well attended to.</p>
<p>What are we, preschool?</p>
<p>What do that?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Execute a couple of a couple of a couple of trades.</p>
<p>So what were the calls?</p>
<p>Well, you know, crypto is like a 24-7 market these days.</p>
<p>Crypto never sleeps.</p>
<p>So David Saks has to excuse himself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got wired 800 Hong Kong gold had to trade.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So OK, so first of all, the food was amazing.</p>
<p>We had like this incredible.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t eat it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t eat it.</p>
<p>No, I did.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>You had the Brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>You ate none of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a diet.</p>
<p>I did eat the sushi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this incredible sushi spread.</p>
<p>We had so much sushi.</p>
<p>Most of it didn&rsquo;t get eaten.</p>
<p>Then we had pizza&rsquo;s got the best late night pizzas from two different</p>
<p>pizza places got delivered.</p>
<p>There was more than one pizza per person in terms of selection.</p>
<p>It was Tony&rsquo;s Neapolitan.</p>
<p>You had homemade caramel sauce poured over to my that was good.</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let you.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>Yeah, props to the chef put Dolce de leche on the vanilla.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the Colgate in 2013, the state nine is a fantastic ball of wine that I had another</p>
<p>ball of it earlier this week.</p>
<p>We just lost 42% of the audience.</p>
<p>They are now on the YouTube comment saying, why are these people?</p>
<p>Why do we listen to this pot every week?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your mouth is you were very quiet and sort of sullen the whole night from really</p>
<p>the time you got there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of true.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t really participate in the conversation.</p>
<p>And Sky hypothesized that the reason why you were so withdrawn is because you were upset</p>
<p>that the game had moved from your place to my place.</p>
<p>And you thought somehow I was trying to hijack your game, which is not true.</p>
<p>We do a game at my place.</p>
<p>Maybe no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I told I told Sky text already.</p>
<p>I said, hey, guys, we normally run the game Thursdays at my house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to come up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s harder for me because that&rsquo;s almost do right.</p>
<p>So you were upset from the get go that you were.</p>
<p>No, I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I told I told him that pretty candidly.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s another underlying here.</p>
<p>Friedberg and sacks have not come to the last three games at your mom&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Is there something going on here?</p>
<p>Is it just the commute?</p>
<p>I think the commute is hard.</p>
<p>I mean, in fairness to you guys,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I only missed the last game.</p>
<p>I went, I went to sacks.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t been coming.</p>
<p>And I know he&rsquo;s in he&rsquo;s in town.</p>
<p>Is there something on sacks where you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s anymore.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s either the commute or sometimes I&rsquo;m out of town, you know, so you were in town</p>
<p>the last couple of times.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of you and come up.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to go for a walk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come the next Wednesday game.</p>
<p>Whenever the next game is, you should come.</p>
<p>But I mean, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Staying home playing chess with Peter Thiel on your iPad?</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>Both me and Friedberg are about to have kids.</p>
<p>We cannot.</p>
<p>Oh, the game is over.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>For another couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to revert back to that terrible COVID app, iPad app playing poker, where like</p>
<p>everyone gets at each other.</p>
<p>Oh, the Chinese app that was fixed with a bunch of people colluding.</p>
<p>Everyone is so angry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll get it back in the next.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s start our show.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the show.</p>
<p>First up in SPAC land, Donald Trump has done a SPAC and it&rsquo;s for his Trump Media and Technology</p>
<p>Group.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s launching an app called Truth Social, which you can preload, I guess in the app</p>
<p>store, you&rsquo;re allowed to preorder stuff.</p>
<p>Now that that was kind of an interesting feature.</p>
<p>The company will merge with the SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Corporation, ticker</p>
<p>symbol currently DWAC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s led by somebody named Patrick Orlando, who is a Florida based investment manager.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making that up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Orlando is actually his name.</p>
<p>He founded a sugar trading business and built two energy distribution businesses,</p>
<p>allegedly or supposedly.</p>
<p>Freeberg said maybe he&rsquo;s a real estate guy who knows the stock peaked at $157 a share</p>
<p>this morning, Friday morning.</p>
<p>So the SPAC started at 10 bucks.</p>
<p>It started at 10.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 16x before dropping back down to 100.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a bit of a meme stock on Wall Street.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trading was halted.</p>
<p>It puts this at something in the range of a, you know, well over a $10 billion market cap.</p>
<p>And there is literally no technology, no team.</p>
<p>And a bunch of technologists looked at the source code just by doing view source, I think,</p>
<p>on the on the web pages.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an open source project, I think, called Master Don or Master Tan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Master Don that they seem to have just copied the code from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a distributed version of Twitter.</p>
<p>And it seems they just cut and pasted the code and didn&rsquo;t even change the license.</p>
<p>You know, like the GPL license, we&rsquo;re supposed to give credit to who wrote the code.</p>
<p>So no business, no team, no IP, no users, no money, no office, no nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an NFT.</p>
<p>This is an NFT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an NFT.</p>
<p>And basically&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exchange traded NFT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an NFT of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The value of this thing is like closer to&hellip;</p>
<p>Donald Trump is closer to 20 billion because there&rsquo;s a $1.7 billion value if they hit certain</p>
<p>stock prices, according to the press release they put out, but there&rsquo;s not a good SEC filing on it.</p>
<p>So at 1.7, that means he got 170 million shares, which are now worth, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>at $157 a share.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has effectively 20 plus billion dollars.</p>
<p>Oh, so he&rsquo;s finally a billionaire?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s finally a billionaire of equity value in his stake in this thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually a billionaire.</p>
<p>And I think this is the absolute penultimate NFT.</p>
<p>It is traded against a caricature that is a one of a kind, completely rare.</p>
<p>All of his quote unquote media IP is going to be licensed into this SPAC.</p>
<p>And so if you want to own a piece of it, this is the way to own it.</p>
<p>And people are trading it like an index on the Donald Trump character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an index on that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an index on the right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an index on an alternative to Fox News.</p>
<p>The traditional media?</p>
<p>The traditional media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge fuck you to actually the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I think this is good.</p>
<p>Twitter?</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&rsquo;s gonna tilt the hell out of like the folks that write at the New York Times.</p>
<p>My gosh.</p>
<p>Did you see Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s tweet, by the way?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it in the chat.</p>
<p>But he made a comment on it after there was a screenshot.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a grift.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the ultimate peak grift in the peak bubble of our lifetime.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a vote.</p>
<p>Like Peter Thiel said yesterday, you know, like Bitcoin is a vote against the establishment.</p>
<p>This is a vote against the establishment.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What are the chances that an actual app launches Saks?</p>
<p>Like, and when would that actually happen?</p>
<p>When can this crew of dipshits actually write a line of code and actually release a product?</p>
<p>You know how hard it is to release product.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, what they&rsquo;re saying is that they&rsquo;re going to launch a new social network,</p>
<p>I guess, Twitter style called Truth Social.</p>
<p>And the primary interface will consist of a feed of short posts from users you follow.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar.</p>
<p>However, these posts will be called truths instead of tweets,</p>
<p>and re-shares will be known as re-truths.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And the slide deck that&rsquo;s available on the company&rsquo;s website list, Twitter, Facebook,</p>
<p>Netflix, Disney Plus, CNN, iHeartMedia, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services,</p>
<p>as some of TMTG&rsquo;s current and future competitors.</p>
<p>So basically, you know, Trump is proposing an alternative to all the traditional media</p>
<p>and social networks that have basically banned him.</p>
<p>But I do think that the trading here does represent, there is, I think, a groundswell</p>
<p>for social media platforms that are not controlled by big tech.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s Trump has 70 million tech voters, sorry,</p>
<p>70 million voters of those, probably 30 to 40 million, you would say are,</p>
<p>would be fans of his on social media.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been banned from Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>And this is his response.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s to create his own platform.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it ultimately be successful.</p>
<p>But I think what you&rsquo;re seeing here is the demand for alternatives to,</p>
<p>you know, censorious platforms that are controlled by big tech.</p>
<p>So if he has 30 million real fans, Chamath,</p>
<p>what number of them would download the app and participate in the first year?</p>
<p>He had 90 million followers on Twitter, Jacob, which doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s half of the Twitter registered account.</p>
<p>We had 70 million people vote for him.</p>
<p>So what are the real fans, not just Republicans who don&rsquo;t want Hillary?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way to think about this.</p>
<p>I would I would view this as differently than this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s insane is you have this entity here, which is essentially a cash shell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now basically, you know, 300 odd million dollars of cash.</p>
<p>Plus what looks like 18 or 19 billion dollars of brand value, like of intangible goodwill.</p>
<p>And the sum total of that is what the total market cap of this thing is.</p>
<p>So if it is 18 billion, then that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>What this allows them to do, and this is where it kind of gets interesting,</p>
<p>is these guys, what it shows me is they could come back and actually raise</p>
<p>an enormous amount of money.</p>
<p>They could issue, you know, a secondary stock sale.</p>
<p>They could do a convert.</p>
<p>They could raise billions of dollars because the demand is there.</p>
<p>And then with those billions of dollars, they could actually do something really meaningful.</p>
<p>They could go and acquire an existing app, Jason.</p>
<p>Call it, call it.</p>
<p>They could acquire engineers and a product that already exists.</p>
<p>Maybe do an acquire, yeah.</p>
<p>They could acquire a traditional broadcast outlet and give Trump,</p>
<p>you know, a way to short circuit his launch of a Fox competitor.</p>
<p>So I actually think this is a huge vote.</p>
<p>I think David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vote against censorship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vote for Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vote for the right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vote for alternative voices.</p>
<p>And as a result, I think a lot of folks in the mainstream who have Trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p>are now going to be, you know, reawoken and in complete full tilt for a while.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty tilty.</p>
<p>TMTG Plus will be, you know, it&rsquo;s terrible branding, but the TMTG Plus is going to be there.</p>
<p>Look at this, you&rsquo;re already tilted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super, no, I&rsquo;m not tilted.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the whole thing is just a super grift.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll ever get a product out the door.</p>
<p>And if they do, I think they get to maybe five, 10 million users.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to raise.</p>
<p>J-Cal, they&rsquo;ve got a $20 billion market cap.</p>
<p>They could do whatever the hell they want.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all people just manipulating the stock like GameStop.</p>
<p>Like Chamath said, they could turn that into cash.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I mean, they could turn a billion of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they can get the 20 billion.</p>
<p>Trump today, in one day, is worth more than two times the New York Times.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what&rsquo;s going on in the New York Times right now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just brand.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I mean, not all these SPACs stay at $150 a share, you know.</p>
<p>So, J-Cal, I think you&rsquo;re right that people outside the tech industry really underestimate</p>
<p>how hard it is to build technology products that are any good, you know, that have a good UI.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re delightful to users.</p>
<p>It does require real talent.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not sort of from the industry, you don&rsquo;t even know what kind of talent you need to</p>
<p>hire.</p>
<p>However, I think Chamath has a really good point that with this kind of market cap,</p>
<p>they could acquire their way to a portfolio of assets.</p>
<p>Like, for example, okay, Rumble right now has become the alternative to YouTube among,</p>
<p>not just conservatives, but anyone who&rsquo;s been deplatformed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of leftists now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Locals.com that you invested in.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>I invested in Locals, which is Dave Rubin&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>So, but just to take Rumble for a second, because it&rsquo;s kind of the YouTube competitor,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ve got something like 30 million users plus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s a pretty big and growing audience.</p>
<p>But there is Locals.</p>
<p>There are other assets.</p>
<p>And you could, and I think the last valuation of Rumble, I think it was announced when Peter</p>
<p>Thiel actually invested, I think it was around a $500 million valuation.</p>
<p>Even if you paid a gigantic premium to that, I mean, if your market cap is 20 billion,</p>
<p>you could spend 2 billion on that.</p>
<p>You could spend 5 billion on that, you know?</p>
<p>And by the way, sorry, just to dispel this idea, you don&rsquo;t need good UI</p>
<p>if you have the right feature set.</p>
<p>And Reddit is the perfect example where they&rsquo;ve always been on the side of free speech.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve always been on the side of allowing people to vocalize and pursue their own passions.</p>
<p>Even if some of those things were really, you know, for the mainstream, beyond the pale,</p>
<p>their UI is terrible, but they have thrived because that single feature</p>
<p>dominates any desire for elegant UI.</p>
<p>And so, I think what you&rsquo;re going to find over this next iteration of these apps is</p>
<p>how valuable free speech is.</p>
<p>And there are enough examples, whether it&rsquo;s Rumble or Reddit or others,</p>
<p>that show you that the ability to not be censored dominates.</p>
<p>4chan, Discord, they&rsquo;re all very similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to tweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to tweak.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>The folks on the left are on super mega tip.</p>
<p>They did figure out how to do data analysis and marketing during his 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>And they did get that guy Pascal or whatever.</p>
<p>And they figured out Cambridge Analytica.</p>
<p>So they did figure out how to get some tech people, right?</p>
<p>Saks to, you know, by the way, can I just say one thing?</p>
<p>The other super tilting thing is people will want to fade this trade.</p>
<p>And, you know, they&rsquo;re going to be silent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to they&rsquo;re going to be silently wishing for this thing to crater.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of profit taking on this because I think it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>speculative.</p>
<p>But I think we will all be shocked at the actual closing enterprise value when this</p>
<p>thing de SPACs because it will de SPAC.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all going to kind of scratch our heads thinking, how did we not see this?</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t see this.</p>
<p>I would have never.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be at least a billion dollars of cash available when they do their</p>
<p>second at least, at least.</p>
<p>I mean, they can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re going to have more more cash available to them to invest.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re he is he is firmly back in the game.</p>
<p>And by the way, one of the comments Garamucci made this morning, it&rsquo;s a very astute one,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m rooting for the SPAC because if this actually does de SPAC at this valuation,</p>
<p>Donald Trump is not running for president again, because he&rsquo;s now got a $20 billion</p>
<p>media business or $20 million of equity value in this new media business that he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to keep running.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you think?</p>
<p>That could be a win-win for the Republican Party.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re buying the stock, you&rsquo;re joining the board.</p>
<p>Sax is leading the B.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Chamath raised a good point that sites like Reddit have shown that</p>
<p>like a beautiful UI is not necessarily the feature that users want in every case.</p>
<p>I do think you still have to have some tech talent involved in order to produce a good</p>
<p>product.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example.</p>
<p>So this product wasn&rsquo;t supposed to have its soft launch until next month.</p>
<p>But somehow, some users found a way to access the site.</p>
<p>And they were setting up accounts within hours of the announcement.</p>
<p>So one vandal claimed the at Donald J.</p>
<p>Trump handle and posted a picture of a pig with extremely large testicles.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Now, I would just submit that you at least need to have enough tech talent to prevent</p>
<p>something like that from happening.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a vandal.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe Trump posted that photo himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on brand.</p>
<p>But anyway, my point is they still have to assemble the tech talent to build this.</p>
<p>Or I like the idea better of just acquiring the collection of assets that they need.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s multifaceted.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a social network.</p>
<p>But a lot Twitter, I think it&rsquo;s probably some sort of video not underestimate the number</p>
<p>of people in Wall Street, who are on the right, and who will help these guys make very good</p>
<p>decisions, even if they do it sort of, you know, quote, unquote, clandestinely, meaning</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll never be on the cover of helping them do a big M&amp;A or whatever.</p>
<p>But there are there are a lot of those folks that will help make sure that this dispatch</p>
<p>cleanly, that they have access to capital, that they know how to go and raise and tap</p>
<p>the markets.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s beautiful about the public markets, and you can say this is, you know, an issue,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not in this case, is that, you know, you can go on and basically support this guy</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s relatively anonymous, because it&rsquo;s not like you have to disclose that you</p>
<p>own this stuff if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a private investor.</p>
<p>So I think that he&rsquo;s back in the game in a big way.</p>
<p>And I think this is going to really shake up the media landscape, if they can execute</p>
<p>well, they just need to think about this as an M&amp;A vehicle, not as an engineering and</p>
<p>product creation.</p>
<p>Yes, 100% agree.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Would you sell call in for a billion dollars in equity value at $100 a share to these guys</p>
<p>today?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can answer on his behalf.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, is that what you were doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the 20x lift.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take 20x in eight months.</p>
<p>Jake, you want to be my agent?</p>
<p>I think you have a quicker line to trump.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I think actually, this might be like to Peter Thiel&rsquo;s point, like, maybe don&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>product, literally, but take the market cap seriously.</p>
<p>Because this is a lot of if they can keep even a $5 billion market up, I do agree that</p>
<p>does make them dangerous in terms of buying assets.</p>
<p>And I do think they can get the first five, all of these right wing services get five</p>
<p>to he gets five to 10 million people to sign up for him, even his like signal.</p>
<p>He was at like a million, you know, very quickly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got like a signal or telegram group, I think.</p>
<p>And he got to me, he could buy maybe he could buy Ben Shapiro&rsquo;s daily caller.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big media brand on the right that people listen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Keep Ben Shapiro there to run it because Trump needs operators.</p>
<p>And the more disruptive thing isn&rsquo;t to buy stuff on the right, it&rsquo;s to buy stuff in the</p>
<p>center or even stuff on the left.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a public company, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Actually, if Trump Media Group now has a currency and tries to acquire assets, the directors</p>
<p>have a fiduciary responsibility to actually vote in favor of that deal, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to look at who the buyer is and say, No, we don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>So if he puts out a reasonable fair market offer price, you know, of the closing price,</p>
<p>plus 3035%, there is not a single public market director in the world, I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>how democrat tick they are, or how much of a donor they are, they&rsquo;ll always vote the</p>
<p>deal, because otherwise, they will get personally sued.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the liability in public markets.</p>
<p>So I would be very careful about this thing.</p>
<p>This thing is going to get really serious really quickly.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a tentpole media personality that he could acquire in the same way Spotify</p>
<p>got Joe Rogan and Netflix got Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>Back to somebody they could offer $100 million.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They should do what Saks just said, which is that, you know, that that list of like</p>
<p>the dumpster fire on Facebook every day, which is like Dan Buenigno, and Ben Shapiro, and</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>He should just go and get all those guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I just said, round them up.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there&rsquo;s like a comedian, you know, like, you know, Bill Maher&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>hates him.</p>
<p>But then is there somebody in the middle who is like a notable comedian on the right Saks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fully vetted on your buddies.</p>
<p>But who&rsquo;s in that alt-right cohort that?</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s comics who are willing to be politically incorrect and non-woke.</p>
<p>So, I think, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Like Bill Burr or something like that, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Yeah, Bill Burr&rsquo;s in that team Netflix.</p>
<p>But yeah, I wonder if a Bill Burr, he hates Trump, though, I think.</p>
<p>Or who is the guy who got canceled for exposing himself?</p>
<p>Louis CK.</p>
<p>Yeah, Louis CK.</p>
<p>Louis CK.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s conservative, right?</p>
<p>But, you know.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Both those guys hate him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s highly available.</p>
<p>I mean, actually, one thing to think about is, you know, Trump got all these people to</p>
<p>do like the monthly $25 reoccurring subscription.</p>
<p>And he got in a little bit of trouble for that because people didn&rsquo;t know they were</p>
<p>signing up for it.</p>
<p>But I wonder if he could get a million people or 5 million people to pay $10 a month for</p>
<p>the Saks.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something there behind the curtain.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s nothing but like, I don&rsquo;t know, a newsletter of his extemporaneous tweets,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s real content there from people they care about, why wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>What if he just did every Friday night, a rally on a video service where he just did</p>
<p>one of his two or three hour standup routines and had different people come up and talk</p>
<p>like his pillow guy and all of his other weirdos in his circle?</p>
<p>I think this could be like the Oprah Winfrey network where she may like anchor the Temple</p>
<p>show or something.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of other creators on the network.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the opportunity he has.</p>
<p>The question, quite frankly, though, is whether he&rsquo;s operational enough to actually drive</p>
<p>to these outcomes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very easy for us to imagine what you could do with $20 billion and his</p>
<p>media brand.</p>
<p>And the question is just, does this get executed that way?</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not going to be a real estate sugar guy from Florida that&rsquo;s going to manage this</p>
<p>thing to an outcome.</p>
<p>Does Twitter then let him back on the platform if he has this competing platform?</p>
<p>Does Facebook?</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>No, I think at that point, they have the perfect excuse not to let him back on, which is like,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re not censoring him because he&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an alternative.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to let him back on.</p>
<p>In a way, I guess you have to ask yourself if Twitter had let him come back on and gave</p>
<p>him his platform back after like a six month or a year timeout.</p>
<p>Would he even be doing this?</p>
<p>No, he says in he has a press announcement where he says that I mean, he says here that</p>
<p>Trump Media and Technology Group&rsquo;s mission is to create a rival to the liberal media</p>
<p>consortium and fight back against the big tech companies in Silicon Valley, which have</p>
<p>user unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s given him the opportunity is their censorship.</p>
<p>Their censorship just created a $20 billion war chest.</p>
<p>I mean, the most tilting thing of this whole conversation is it&rsquo;s worth twice as much as</p>
<p>the New York Times.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been saying on this show for over a year that censorship backfires in ways you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>You never think through the second and third order consequences of their censorship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when Angela Merkel came out and said, hey, like, wait, did Twitter just</p>
<p>deplatform ahead of state?</p>
<p>Why are we depending on them?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all these second or third order consequences they never think through.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re coming back to bite them in the ass.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, forcing people to get vaccines is now leading to whatever percentage of people</p>
<p>just retiring or, you know, or not coming back to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s causing a bit of bedlam in the economy, as we talked about.</p>
<p>All these authoritarian tendencies create a backlash of some kind.</p>
<p>And if our ruling elites would just have a lighter hand, there&rsquo;d be a lot less tension</p>
<p>in the country.</p>
<p>We had an interesting discussion last night at during, but I think it was on the other</p>
<p>side of the table.</p>
<p>So maybe you two didn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<p>But we were talking about is Biden going to run again in 2024?</p>
<p>And what would that look like?</p>
<p>And I just said, I can&rsquo;t imagine Biden in a debate three years from now, like, he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem I don&rsquo;t want to be derogatory here, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem very crisp the last time four</p>
<p>years later.</p>
<p>So what do we think?</p>
<p>Chances of Biden running in 2024 chances of Trump running in 2024 with all this information</p>
<p>and what would that look like?</p>
<p>Zero and zero.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re zero and zero.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you even care?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think Trump&rsquo;s gonna run this $20 billion media empire and gonna be happy</p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s not Biden, it&rsquo;s gonna be a proxy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not going to be too far off in terms of what the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deep in this sax you&rsquo;re hosting, as people were talking about on Twitter.</p>
<p>And you tilted all of San Francisco or 90% of it, you&rsquo;re hosting</p>
<p>DeSantis for a fundraiser,</p>
<p>his first fundraiser for his reelection as governor.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t said anything about his plans in 2024.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too early for that.</p>
<p>Do I think Biden or Trump could be on the ballot?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 5050 for both of them.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I would like to see but look, instead of having two 80 year olds running against each</p>
<p>other, I would like to see, say 240 something or just younger leaders, you know, giving</p>
<p>America a real choice.</p>
<p>All right, where do we want to jump off to now venture capital,</p>
<p>venture capital, because clearly sacks is is having extraordinary liquidity events at</p>
<p>11 o&rsquo;clock at night on a Thursday night that freeberg money is not made is simply transferred</p>
<p>from one perception to another perception to another.</p>
<p>Wall Street speech.</p>
<p>Sax was like in his</p>
<p>monologues from Wall Street last night, he was leaving the poker table to go to into his</p>
<p>soundproof chamber that oversees his estate next to the poker room.</p>
<p>And from there, he was on his phone screaming, pacing back and forth, doing deals.</p>
<p>Gecko style.</p>
<p>He had his 300 pound trader next to him.</p>
<p>He was placing orders.</p>
<p>And something&rsquo;s going on in the market.</p>
<p>I mean, sacks, you know, do tell.</p>
<p>But clearly, the venture liquidity</p>
<p>waterfall that&rsquo;s going on right now is playing into a lot of it.</p>
<p>It is bonkers.</p>
<p>Wait, we got to show that chart.</p>
<p>Highlight the statistics, Jake, because it is truly extraordinary how much</p>
<p>liquidity venture firms are having this year.</p>
<p>All right, well, just to look at the value of US venture backed companies that went public</p>
<p>or were acquired 290 billion 280 billion in 19 and 20.</p>
<p>And then this year, 2021.</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;re at 590 billion is literally doubled.</p>
<p>But if you look back, it was but 110 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>So we are now five, six x where we were five years ago.</p>
<p>And this is, again, the value of US venture backed companies that went public or acquired.</p>
<p>So the liquidity is bonkers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing that in real estate, you know, jets being bought, whatever.</p>
<p>The VC industry has experienced three years of record breaking exits.</p>
<p>This is a Twitter user who tweeted it.</p>
<p>2021 is obviously smashing all those levels.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, for the last until the last three years, the previous 1520 years,</p>
<p>the exits per year were in this 50 to 100 billion range, then they&rsquo;ve jumped up to 600</p>
<p>billion in the last year.</p>
<p>And in the previous two years, it was 300 billion each.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just more money has has been made, or distributed out in the</p>
<p>venture capital industry in the last three years, I think the previous 20 years combined, at least</p>
<p>the last three years.</p>
<p>Yeah, that doesn&rsquo;t that doesn&rsquo;t even factor in what&rsquo;s happening in crypto, right?</p>
<p>And crypto is just I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some crypto in here, Coinbase is in here as</p>
<p>No, like, like, like, in my portfolio, as an example, like, you know, like venture returns,</p>
<p>which have which have been excellent across the board.</p>
<p>So forget mine, just everybody&rsquo;s venture value kind of like slowly ticks up over time,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because like, you know, you&rsquo;re doing this work, and then that work gets valued.</p>
<p>And then somebody else comes in and raises a new round.</p>
<p>And, you know, you hopefully can defend your prorata, yada, yada.</p>
<p>So it does create a lot of compounding value.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, and it&rsquo;s relatively fast.</p>
<p>But compared to crypto, it&rsquo;s unbelievably slow.</p>
<p>Whereas in crypto, you know, quarter over quarter, you have these swings that I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>personally never ever seen, like I was telling you this story yesterday, we own something,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what it is, but it&rsquo;s a crypto thing.</p>
<p>And our nav, I had to mark my book up a billion net asset value on that asset,</p>
<p>I had to mark it up, because, you know, we have to submit to our auditors and just keep</p>
<p>an accurate sense of what our book value is $1 billion in a quarter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen that in my entire investing career.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how what it does to me and my whole team.</p>
<p>I have a budget for next year of how much I want to spend.</p>
<p>Instantly, that number goes up.</p>
<p>And what it really means is I&rsquo;m probably just going to be getting the same ownership,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to be paying more for it.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m going through that, I think everybody&rsquo;s going to go through it.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s going to do is it&rsquo;s like all of this, all of these returns are great.</p>
<p>All of these increases are great.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s going to be that much more progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not necessarily going to be that many more startups, because it&rsquo;s just harder and harder to</p>
<p>find good things in the same for the same number of GPS in a place.</p>
<p>And costs are going bananas, salaries are off the charts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw but Stripe, for example, there was a tweet about how</p>
<p>Stripe starting to pay like starting engineers 280k.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>But there was a tweet in Twitter.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, my gosh, like 20 years ago, a starting engineering salary was 5060k</p>
<p>in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve seen this incredible price inflation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually quite good.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s sort of what we talked about yesterday.</p>
<p>All of these gains eventually come back around and get recaptured.</p>
<p>And so I think like you&rsquo;re starting to see the beginning of this really incredible cycle of</p>
<p>wealth transfer, essentially.</p>
<p>So the funds may make it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to come back to a question about the crypto stuff.</p>
<p>Is there any worry there that these valuations match reality?</p>
<p>Because you might have a very small float on these a lot of excitement, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>actually products being used by customers in the real world.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing I because it&rsquo;s an internal permanent pool of capital, I have no legal</p>
<p>requirement to actually mark.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the reason we do it is because we want to track nav and AV and book value.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And, you know, I compensate my team based on how well we compound book value.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge problem, because I don&rsquo;t know how to get liquid on these things.</p>
<p>And so you see this thing sitting on your, your balance sheet.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, what do we do with this?</p>
<p>How do you move it around?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you cannot.</p>
<p>And so I would rather there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a great guy.</p>
<p>He was an early pioneer of private equity.</p>
<p>And he had this phrase, which he said, like, you know, the best way to mark up a deal is</p>
<p>right at the end.</p>
<p>So if you put in, you know, $10 million into a Series A, if you could be allowed, the best</p>
<p>thing to do would be carry that at a $10 million value right until the minute you get liquid.</p>
<p>Because then you don&rsquo;t go through the psychological rollercoaster ride of having to go through</p>
<p>these marks.</p>
<p>Because then when these marks come back down, Jason, to your point, there&rsquo;ll be there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be a quarter where we give back that billion dollars of that, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, what do we all do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge mindfuck.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question about valuation.</p>
<p>Saks, when you&rsquo;re doing yours, because this came up when I was doing mine and marking</p>
<p>my funds.</p>
<p>If a secondary transaction occurs, and somebody buys calm or, you know, slack, or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s a private company at $10 a share, but the last time you purchased it,</p>
<p>or there was a funding two years ago, it was at $2 a share.</p>
<p>Where do you put the valuation at what the secondary market is trading it at, or what</p>
<p>you last paid for it, or somewhere in between those?</p>
<p>And who makes that decision, Saks?</p>
<p>What is the best practice on this?</p>
<p>Because secondary market transactions, people are actually making a transaction.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But is that as good as a venture firm, you know, plodding down and joining the board?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So first of all, you don&rsquo;t want to be making these decisions ad hoc, you want to have a</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>So we have a written policy, and there&rsquo;s a process for amending it if it ever needs to</p>
<p>be amended.</p>
<p>And what our policy does is it just uses the most recent preferred round to give us the</p>
<p>value of the shares.</p>
<p>And then there can be adjustments based on market conditions.</p>
<p>Like, we know that it&rsquo;s usually on the downward, right?</p>
<p>Like, if a company we know has had a huge problem, they&rsquo;re not going to fundraise again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not going to be a new market anytime soon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a zombie company, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, if it&rsquo;s a zombie company, we can mark it down.</p>
<p>But basically speaking, we use preferred financing valuations to set marks only.</p>
<p>Now, we do sometimes buy secondary shares, and there&rsquo;s a methodology for putting a value</p>
<p>on them.</p>
<p>Usually, it&rsquo;s basically what we buy them at.</p>
<p>And if we somehow otherwise own common, we&rsquo;ll use the 409A.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really, really clean policy.</p>
<p>You want to be conservative in these because nothing would be worse.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you have to be accurate, not conservative.</p>
<p>Accurate, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you could be, yeah, I guess the question is, like, you could see somebody</p>
<p>playing some games where, you know, you buy, you know, some shares at the, you own shares</p>
<p>in the company, you buy some shares in secondary, and now you&rsquo;ve got two marks, right?</p>
<p>The embedded risk in venture capital has always been the following, which is that you have</p>
<p>money that goes in into the A. And there is an incentive today, especially because so</p>
<p>much money is trying to come in, where you want to drive as much growth as possible,</p>
<p>because then the B is at such a large step up that the IRRs look amazing.</p>
<p>And then the C looks greater than the B. So then everybody&rsquo;s, quote, unquote, making paper</p>
<p>money, which allows you to create more incentives to raise more capital.</p>
<p>The problem with all of that is that if these valuations ever turn out to not be real, or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a valuation reset, or there&rsquo;s inflation, or the public markets don&rsquo;t value growth stocks,</p>
<p>it takes a long time for it to work its way through the venture ecosystem.</p>
<p>And all of this liquidity will probably make it even more, quote, unquote, you know, violent when</p>
<p>it does happen, because it&rsquo;ll eventually will happen. We&rsquo;ll go through a rerating, like the</p>
<p>year 2000, who knows when it is and what the catalyst is. But that&rsquo;s the real downside of not</p>
<p>of all of this is that it&rsquo;ll eventually have a valuation reset that&rsquo;s going to make this</p>
<p>super real for people. US venture capital funds have raised a combined 69.1 billion in 2020,</p>
<p>edging past the 2018. And a couple of these were because of Andreessen Horowitz,</p>
<p>doing a pair of mega funds with 4.5 billion in commitments recently. And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been just a tremendous amount of funds being made. And then to give you an example,</p>
<p>clubhouse went from 100 million to a billion to 4 billion in under 18 months evaluation led I think</p>
<p>each time by Andreessen Horowitz. So what you&rsquo;re saying in an example like this, or in your</p>
<p>hypothetical example, and I&rsquo;ll just make it a real world one. If they take though, and by the way,</p>
<p>these are 2021 2020 stats, I don&rsquo;t know what the 2021 stats are. So those are old stats. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably many more. I think actually, I have the updated stats. Funds have raised 96 billion for</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>That&rsquo;s the most updated fairness to all of the venture capitalists. I think that they&rsquo;re</li>
</ol>
<p>doing exactly what they should be doing. And in fairness to all the crossover funds right now is</p>
<p>the time to be putting maximum money to work as fast as possible, not necessarily intelligently,</p>
<p>not necessarily in a concentrated way. But the real game if you want to play it at the</p>
<p>institutional level is to just put all the chips on the table, and then go back to the store and</p>
<p>get some more chips as quickly as possible, put them all on the table, come back and get more</p>
<p>so that when it all you know, is said and done, you have as many dollars working. And the worst</p>
<p>case is, you will return the average return of the market. And if that happens to be good, you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>look good. If it happens to be crappy, you&rsquo;ll be no worse, better, worse off than anybody else.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, you will have collected enormous fees. And so that&rsquo;s the point in the cycle we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at. And I think that anybody who&rsquo;s doing it makes a ton of sense. I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a really logical</p>
<p>thing to be doing. The ones that have had big liquidity events are also retiring. I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing across the board GPs of these ultra successful funds that have returned 5x plus taken</p>
<p>their kid. Yeah, and they got their carried interest and they share their 20-25% share in</p>
<p>that and they walk away. But if you look at the value of all global public equities, it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>$100 trillion. And so if you&rsquo;re seeing, let&rsquo;s say that we&rsquo;re raising $100 billion a year of</p>
<p>venture capital in these funds, and then you&rsquo;re making a 2.5x average market return, which is</p>
<p>not normal, right? Let&rsquo;s assume that&rsquo;s the normal cycle we&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s $250 billion of liquidity realized in a year out of $100 trillion of global public equities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only a quarter of a percent of the disruption of public equities. And think</p>
<p>about it. Technology is set up to disrupt all of these old school businesses that are public and</p>
<p>mature and scaled. And that&rsquo;s what the $100 trillion represents. So it&rsquo;s actually, looking</p>
<p>at it statistically, it&rsquo;s not that unfounded that we&rsquo;re only seeing a quarter percent market cap</p>
<p>disruption of public equities each year, because those public companies aren&rsquo;t disrupting each</p>
<p>other generally, maybe to some extent they are, they&rsquo;re getting disrupted by new companies that</p>
<p>are emerging, new startups. And so I don&rsquo;t think that this is necessarily the peak, it may be</p>
<p>the beginning of a continuing disruption cycle that we&rsquo;re going to see persist for the next decade or</p>
<p>two, especially as more of the old school industrial businesses, which make up a bulk of</p>
<p>that market cap, start to get disrupted, not just by software, but also by automation, by ESG angle</p>
<p>investing, by life sciences, and all these other kind of technologies that and these interests,</p>
<p>these market interests that are going to disrupt those old industries, I think we could even see</p>
<p>an acceleration from here. So, you know, I don&rsquo;t think that this is necessarily peak, frenzied,</p>
<p>bubbled, low interest rate fueled outcomes. I think this may be kind of part of a longer term</p>
<p>trend that is statistically probably not that big a deal.</p>
<p>Saks, are you concerned about this peak bubbly market? Or do you think,</p>
<p>you know, like Chamath said, push all your chips in and raise as big a fund as you can. And,</p>
<p>you know, if the game is going to be played at these high stakes, you want to be at the table?</p>
<p>Well, I like what Freeburg said, I think it&rsquo;s a super interesting point that this could just be</p>
<p>the beginning. Look, we live in an age of accelerating technological progress. So why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t the returns from that accelerating technological progress also be accelerating?</p>
<p>You know, we had this thesis 20 years ago, when the internet first started that you had the new</p>
<p>economy replaced the old economy, it took a few years longer than people thought, but we are fully</p>
<p>there. And the number of new companies being created now is just exploding. There is a lot</p>
<p>of this the this liquidity that&rsquo;s being generated is being now pumped into the next set of funds,</p>
<p>which will go to founders, they&rsquo;ll be able to create more companies, they&rsquo;ll be able to keep</p>
<p>more of those companies, because there&rsquo;ll be less dilution. And then a lot of this wealth</p>
<p>is trickling, a lot of the VC money is trickling down into the competition for salary. So anybody,</p>
<p>really anywhere in the world who can learn how to write code, can now, you know, make a six</p>
<p>figure plus salary because of remote work. So all the salaries all over the world are equilibrating.</p>
<p>So I mean, this is an incredible pathway to prosperity for I mean, certainly the United</p>
<p>States, but really the whole world for humanity, for humanity, it&rsquo;s really positive, assuming it</p>
<p>keeps going, assuming it&rsquo;s not just totally liquidity driven. And, you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly, you know, how all those macro forces will play out. But, but I mean, this seems very</p>
<p>positive overall. The other the other thing it&rsquo;ll lead to just quickly is a change in who has</p>
<p>political power, because, you know, ultimately, you know, money is the mother&rsquo;s milk of politics.</p>
<p>And the people who are making all these returns will eventually fund politicians. And, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, well, yeah, I&rsquo;m one of them. Yeah. But look, I think there&rsquo;s two kinds of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say prototypes, politically speaking, for people in the technology world, you&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>got the sort of standard woke progressives who are funding a lot of this crazy stuff,</p>
<p>like decarceration cities, whatever, we talked about that before. But I also think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another prototype that&rsquo;s less loud, and they feel that they&rsquo;re, they kind of keep their views more</p>
<p>to themselves, which is, I call them libertarians, who are sort of liberal on social values,</p>
<p>but libertarian on economic policy, they don&rsquo;t like government regulations, certainly,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re in the crypto world, they don&rsquo;t like government regulations, they could see how they</p>
<p>create, you know, friction to progress. And they believe in markets and, and they will, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna want to fund politicians who support that those types of things. So, you know,</p>
<p>I could be very positive, politically, in that respect.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, I just want to build on what you built on what Friedberg said, which is,</p>
<p>I think the best point you made was look on a global basis of the opportunity for an individual,</p>
<p>somebody who is, you know, graduating high school, college, they&rsquo;re 18 1920 years old,</p>
<p>because of remote work, anybody can work from anywhere, technology companies have unlimited</p>
<p>resources, and they need an un never ending supply of developers, or even a salesperson,</p>
<p>a marketer, you know, back office, etc. And they can work from anywhere on the globe and make a</p>
<p>six figure salary, you know, whatever 5060 7080 k for one of these entry level jobs and sales.</p>
<p>And all the information on how to get those jobs is available for free from startups that have put</p>
<p>open courseware online or very free courses. Yet we&rsquo;re looking at this massive technological</p>
<p>change. And the New York Times is position is that technology is destroying humanity and</p>
<p>polarization of wealth is destroying humanity. What we&rsquo;re actually uncovering here is all of</p>
<p>this money being invested in these companies is giving an opportunity for people around the world</p>
<p>to get high paying jobs. Totally. And actually, can I can I can I mention a really interesting</p>
<p>item in that was just in Politico today, which is about Al Sharpton was lobbying in Congress</p>
<p>against changing the carried interest treatment. So remember, you know, all of us in VC,</p>
<p>make our compensation in the form of carried interest.</p>
<p>Explain what it is.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s basically, you know, if a fund is in profits that you know, the VC will get the VC</p>
<p>is firm will get say 25% of the upside after they pay back all their LPs. That&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>carried interest. Because of the way that these partnerships are set up that is treated as a</p>
<p>capital gains as opposed to ordinary income, assuming it meets the holding periods of the</p>
<p>underlying assets. So there&rsquo;s a big debate about whether you know, VCs and private equity people</p>
<p>should be paying ordinary income or long term cap gains on those returns. Al Sharpton was</p>
<p>lobbying against changing it because in this political Politico article, he was saying that</p>
<p>it would impede the efforts of black entrepreneurs to build lasting wealth if you jacked up the tax</p>
<p>rates, because there&rsquo;s a lot of fund managers and you know, who, who are black, who are making a lot</p>
<p>of money now, and they don&rsquo;t want to be subject to this change in treatment. So that was super</p>
<p>interesting. You know, this tech boom is not, it&rsquo;s not exclusive. I mean, the tech industry gets this</p>
<p>rap as if it&rsquo;s this highly exclusionary place. It&rsquo;s not I mean, three of the people on this pod</p>
<p>right now are immigrants. So you know, the wealth that&rsquo;s being created is not going to traditional</p>
<p>centers traditional, it&rsquo;s not going to the heirs of, you know, Northeastern, you know, families</p>
<p>or something who&rsquo;ve been sending their kids to Harvard and Princeton for generations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to entirely new people who haven&rsquo;t had this kind of wealth before.</p>
<p>Another positive externality of this wealth, all these massive gains that folks who have invested</p>
<p>in venture capital have gotten has caused one really interesting positive change. So Amherst,</p>
<p>which is a really exclusive liberal arts college in the northeast made so much money,</p>
<p>their endowment is so flush with cash, they basically eliminated legacy admittances,</p>
<p>which means if your parents got in, you were 70% likely to get into Amherst,</p>
<p>an equivalent kid whose parents didn&rsquo;t go to Amherst had a less than 6% admit rate,</p>
<p>right. So huge disparity, basically said, if you were a legacy kid that exists,</p>
<p>you know, we all know this, it exists at Harvard, it exists at all these Ivy League schools.</p>
<p>But Amherst is now so has made so much money through VC investments, as an example,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ve canceled admittances. So there&rsquo;s there are there are some really positive</p>
<p>things that are happening with all this money that&rsquo;s being made.</p>
<p>Al Sharpton&rsquo;s rationale aside, anyone&rsquo;s going to get wealthier, they&rsquo;re paying less taxes.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, you&rsquo;re broadly, yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna see a bit of a focus on that point.</p>
<p>Obviously, which is why Freeberg, California was massively in the bonus, in terms of budget,</p>
<p>surplus and cash because of this issue. And they were spending money like drunken sailors.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I just think you&rsquo;re gonna hear a lot of positioning for, you know, the case. And by</p>
<p>the way, I think that, you know, building individual wealth creates, this is obviously a</p>
<p>philosophical point, but you know, it creates a greater path to prosperity for more people</p>
<p>through the spending that they&rsquo;ll underdo and growing the economy, then, you know, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, I feel like the Al Sharpton point is a good one to kind of make,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a broader one than that. Well, I think, in my view, the broader</p>
<p>point about the Sharpton thing is that it shows that we talk about this group of rich people,</p>
<p>the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, as if it&rsquo;s a static class of people, at least,</p>
<p>this is the progressive attack. It&rsquo;s not. I mean, what Sharpton points to</p>
<p>is that this group is constantly changing, there&rsquo;s new people getting rich.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about the rich, if it&rsquo;s new people getting rich, what we&rsquo;re really talking</p>
<p>about is success. And if you really want to ban people getting rich, I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>banning success, our country can&rsquo;t be successful that way. We&rsquo;re not going to be able to outcompete</p>
<p>China if we&rsquo;re preventing success. And by the way, we can&rsquo;t fund all these progressive programs</p>
<p>if we are, you know, hamstringing success. So, you know, I think this, what we&rsquo;ve created here</p>
<p>with this highly entrepreneurial, free enterprise system that&rsquo;s funded by venture capital,</p>
<p>this is the golden goose of the American economy. And the most important thing is that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break it. Sachs, it might just be we may have underestimated its power is what we&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>realizing collectively here today is that we&rsquo;ve always thought that this thing is hitting all</p>
<p>time highs, this might be the beginning. Right? Like, it feels like this is getting bigger. And,</p>
<p>you know, in going at a velocity that is different than even when we came into the industry,</p>
<p>you know, the amount of exits, the amount the scale of these companies, the Coinbases,</p>
<p>the Robinhoods, the Ubers, the slacks, I mean, these are giant companies making huge international</p>
<p>impacts. I think it&rsquo;s either that or this whole thing is liquidity driven bubble. So it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the two. It&rsquo;s both. It&rsquo;s both. Well, I also think the the Sharpton thing is a very interesting</p>
<p>point that we can go back to maybe episode 25 or 20. When we started this podcast, which was</p>
<p>Trump got massive support from the black and Hispanic community because of this entrepreneurial</p>
<p>freedom, upward mobility pitch, the Republicans were making that&rsquo;s the perfect pitch for the</p>
<p>Republicans, not this divisive, divisive, you know, shut the border down, but more,</p>
<p>hey, we want everybody to support it. And I thought, well, how crazy is it was Michael</p>
<p>Che? Did you want to just add on this? And I&rsquo;ll give it to you, Chamath. Michael Che was on the</p>
<p>Breakfast Club when our friend was hosting SNL. And he said, I don&rsquo;t know, I think white people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t like their billionaires for some reason. It&rsquo;s weird, because we love our billionaires.</p>
<p>If Oprah or Tyler Perry was coming, we&rsquo;d be excited about it. And I met Michael Che there.</p>
<p>Michael Che was really excited. He&rsquo;s a fan of Elon&rsquo;s and like,</p>
<p>it was a really great conversation. They had so true. It&rsquo;s so true. Like,</p>
<p>why are we hating people who are changing the world and helping?</p>
<p>Right? Because it&rsquo;s not we it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, frankly, it&rsquo;s white,</p>
<p>woke progressives. They&rsquo;re crazy. They&rsquo;re the crazy ones.</p>
<p>I think conservatives and what you call woke progressives</p>
<p>are the same. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about a political affinity. I think it&rsquo;s about people feeling like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the opportunity that others clearly were able to realize. And it is amplified</p>
<p>and magnified by social media that that basically shines a light on the success that people have had</p>
<p>in a way that we&rsquo;ve never had in history before. And it creates a great deal of feeling like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>missing out and I&rsquo;m being left out. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving a lot of the discontent on both</p>
<p>the left and 100% it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a political point of view. I think it&rsquo;s a social point of</p>
<p>view. And the great progress we&rsquo;ve had and the great success we&rsquo;ve had as a society over the</p>
<p>past couple of decades, is now being realized through this media in a way that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>driving emotional conditions for people that haven&rsquo;t had the same level of success.</p>
<p>Maybe if they stopped tweeting and complaining and just learn some skills,</p>
<p>like your skill is complaining as the only as the only colored person on this pod, what I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you is I it&rsquo;s very rare that I meet a colored person that hates a successful other colored</p>
<p>person just doesn&rsquo;t exist, guys, tell us more. It&rsquo;s just one of these things where you know,</p>
<p>we were we&rsquo;re all grinding. We all know how hard it is to be on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>If any one of us makes it, there&rsquo;s a lot of support.</p>
<p>I mean, we see that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what I felt.</p>
<p>South African Jews don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>No, I mean, we see that in the incoming emails and tweets to you, Chamath. You are inspiring</p>
<p>people in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, we see it constantly, they come up to you at events.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, hey, if Chamath can figure this out, I can do I&rsquo;m about to do this thing</p>
<p>in Africa. And I&rsquo;m going there in December. I can&rsquo;t wait. And you know, we&rsquo;re thinking of</p>
<p>just doing a couple of like, lectures, let&rsquo;s do it lectures and talks. And these these places are</p>
<p>going to get rammed with people. And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see, like, yeah, I just think</p>
<p>that minorities like don&rsquo;t hate on other people that are successful. It&rsquo;s just not you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to Africa in December. Yeah. Why don&rsquo;t we do all in Africa? What are we doing? Like,</p>
<p>where are you going? I got some stuff. I got some stuff. I&rsquo;m getting email constantly by people who</p>
<p>are starting startups in Africa. I want to go I&rsquo;ve never been I really want you can come with</p>
<p>me in early December if you want. I&rsquo;m in I&rsquo;m 100% I have nothing to do. I&rsquo;m here&rsquo;s the thing that I</p>
<p>wanted to talk about. What is crazy and this is Jason to build on your Trump comment. We may be</p>
<p>facing a situation I&rsquo;d love to get your guys&rsquo;s reaction where Donald Trump in his first two</p>
<p>years of his presidency may actually have gotten more done than Biden will get done in his first</p>
<p>two years. And I just want your guys&rsquo;s reaction and thoughts on how that&rsquo;s possibly could be</p>
<p>because we have a democratic president, we have a democratic Congress, and we may not get anything</p>
<p>done. I can speak to that. Here&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>the windup. I can&rsquo;t believe that the way the progressives have done this reconciliation</p>
<p>bill. It&rsquo;s been crazy. Okay, look, from the beginning, they&rsquo;ve been saying Biden, the</p>
<p>administration, the Democrats have been saying we want to do the biggest package of tax expense</p>
<p>since the Great Society. Okay, but here&rsquo;s the thing. If you want to do LBJ type things, you</p>
<p>got to have LBJ type majorities. They&rsquo;ve got a 5050 Senate and a three seat margin in the house</p>
<p>LBJ when he passed the Great Society, he had like 69 senators, he had a filibuster, super majority</p>
<p>filibuster proof, super majority in the Senate, he had something like 150 seat margin in the house.</p>
<p>That is the kind of margins you need to pass Great Society like programs.</p>
<p>So instead of having, I&rsquo;d say, ambitions that were reasonable, the administration coxes with</p>
<p>the progressives, they come together with this over four and a half billion of spending three</p>
<p>and a half in the social welfare, 1.2 trillion of infrastructure, and they wanted even more. Okay.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve been trying to jam this thing and they never went to the center of the party</p>
<p>to cinema, to mansion and said, hey, what are you guys willing to do? And so somehow, I think</p>
<p>they thought they could just jam this thing through over the objections of these votes that</p>
<p>they absolutely need. And I think there&rsquo;s really this mentality on the part of the progressive left</p>
<p>that I think they&rsquo;re so used to jamming people with speech codes and cancellation and censorship</p>
<p>and COVID mandates that are not passed by legislatures, but have been imposed by EDIC.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just used to jamming people and they think they&rsquo;re going to shame people on Twitter</p>
<p>like these centers, like mansion, like cinema into voting their way.</p>
<p>Guess what? It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Twitter is not the real world. Eric Adams showed that</p>
<p>in New York. He won that election. Exactly. Dave Chappelle has a 95% approval rating. Okay.</p>
<p>The critics hate him. The vote progressives hate him. Guess what? You know how many people were</p>
<p>actually at that Dave Chappelle protest? Like three dozen. Okay. The progressives don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the votes. What they should have done, and by the way, their conduct through the whole thing</p>
<p>has been insane. AOC has basically been saying, if you don&rsquo;t give us everything we want,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not voting for your $1.5 trillion vote. They overplayed their hands.</p>
<p>These guys have like Ace Jack off and they&rsquo;re shoving.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting a gun to their head saying, hey, unless you give us three and a half billion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to vote for one billion. Really? You&rsquo;re going to do that? How does that make sense?</p>
<p>Call their bluff. We know progressives will vote for every penny they can. What Biden should have</p>
<p>done if we had a more hands-on president who actually wants to get things done, and he knows</p>
<p>this from his time in the Senate, he should have gone to those swing senators as a group and said,</p>
<p>hey, what can we get done here? Not to AOC and Pelosi. They can&rsquo;t deliver.</p>
<p>I mean, the promise of Biden, I&rsquo;ll say, you know, as somebody who voted for Biden,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little disappointed was he was supposed to be moderate, and he was supposed to bring</p>
<p>people to the center. And it doesn&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;s actually to your point, you asked us what</p>
<p>we think. I have, I&rsquo;m not regretting because Trump had to go. It was too much chaos. There</p>
<p>was just too much risk having him in there. So I am glad I voted for Biden.</p>
<p>But I am unhappy that he cannot build consensus down the middle and get the far left to just,</p>
<p>you know, pump the brakes. I understand they have passion for certain projects,</p>
<p>but just get something done moderately and in a phased approach. Why does this have to be so huge</p>
<p>and confusing? Do a smaller thing three times.</p>
<p>Sachs is exposing what we may not know, which is that progressives are very loud,</p>
<p>but they may not actually represent a plurality of people. So for example, in the Netflix protest,</p>
<p>I saw a video, and there was about two dozen people, you know, and one person actually had</p>
<p>tweeted, Hey, I never even showed up to the office yet. But now I&rsquo;m showing up to walk out of the</p>
<p>office. But then what happened was there were some other people that showed up and in the middle of</p>
<p>the protest, they had a sign that said, you know, jokes are funny. I like jokes. And then everybody</p>
<p>started chanting that. Then a black woman got up and she started to say Black Lives Matter. And then</p>
<p>everybody got confused and started to chant Black Lives Matter. And then they were all looking around</p>
<p>each other trying to find direction in this protest. And it became somewhat directionless.</p>
<p>And I think this is what you know, we&rsquo;re now realizing is that, you know, remember what like</p>
<p>as managers in corporations, we&rsquo;ve all heard this term, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.</p>
<p>But it may actually be the case that the squeaky wheel shouldn&rsquo;t get the grease because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>head fake, and we&rsquo;re going to get lost in misdirection. Another example of this, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>guy Dorian Abbott, and I wanted to talk about this as well. This is a guy who&rsquo;s an acclaimed climate</p>
<p>professor. Okay, let me just give you the whole story. I&rsquo;m just going to read to you. Because I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s interesting. The first couple paragraphs of the story from the New York Times. MIT invites</p>
<p>geophysicist Dorian Abbott to give a prestigious public lecture this autumn. He seemed a natural</p>
<p>choice. He&rsquo;s a scientific star who studies climate change, and whether planets and distant</p>
<p>solar systems might harbor atmospheres conducive to life. Then a swell of angry resistance arose.</p>
<p>Some faculty members and grad students argued that Dr. Abbott, who&rsquo;s a profit University of Chicago,</p>
<p>had created harm by speaking out against aspects of affirmative action and diversity. Because in</p>
<p>videos and opinion pieces, he wants people and members of groups rather than as individuals.</p>
<p>He basically favors a diverse pool of applicants selected on merit. So but he said his planned</p>
<p>lecture at MIT was about climate science and to help people understand climate change,</p>
<p>and would make no mention of his views on affirmative action. But his opponents argued</p>
<p>that he was infuriating, inappropriate and oppressive. And so they canceled the lecture.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the question I have here. That&rsquo;s another example of all of this stuff.</p>
<p>Are we better off with, let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s 100 grad students, 100 brilliant minds at MIT,</p>
<p>being pushed to think even more specifically about climate change by an expert who can do that?</p>
<p>Or are we better off finding some more middle of the road person who may be not be as intellectually</p>
<p>ambitious around climate change, but has a whole bunch of other views not related to climate change</p>
<p>that are more palatable? And what does that do? For all of us, including probably all these people</p>
<p>who probably want a solution to climate change, but who have now held back the ability to teach</p>
<p>these kids? What do we do? What do we think about that kind of stuff? And this is where again,</p>
<p>the squeaky wheel in this case did get the grease. But are we actually better off in this example,</p>
<p>Friedberg diversity of thought drives successful outcomes?</p>
<p>All right, thanks for coming in for the all in podcast. We&rsquo;re telling you shit you already know.</p>
<p>I mean, like, what are we talking about yourself, people listen to a bunch of opinions.</p>
<p>And if somebody says something you don&rsquo;t like or challenges you to learn or grow or for you to make</p>
<p>a blog post or do your own stand up special, give your own talk that challenges their debate like we</p>
<p>do here every week. Right. But the same thing happened with that. What&rsquo;s that ultra conservative</p>
<p>young guy sacks who went to Berkeley a few years ago, and they blocked him from joining the campus.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the Greek name, Greek name, you know, monopolist. Milo Yiannopoulos. He&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>wing guy, the gay provider. But here we&rsquo;re talking about an expert in climate change,</p>
<p>giving a lecture about climate change to grad students who could then go and solve climate</p>
<p>change for the all of the world. I mean, this is MIT and U Chicago, which are probably two of the</p>
<p>smartest institutions of people in the world. Right? He&rsquo;s not saying anything politically</p>
<p>offensive. It&rsquo;s just that his unrelated views, they view they think are anathema,</p>
<p>and therefore they&rsquo;re going to protest and block him. And of course, you know,</p>
<p>they always use the language of safetyism, which is Oh, well, if you allow this person on campus,</p>
<p>it threatens my safety. Really? This person&rsquo;s a physical threat to you? No, he threatens my</p>
<p>self conception. Really? He said something that, you know, he&rsquo;s gonna talk about something that</p>
<p>offends, you know, it&rsquo;s just that, you know, he said things that that threatened my view of the</p>
<p>world. So my safety is jeopardized. I mean, this is this is literally the language that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>used now. I mean, free works reaction to it is Yeah, this is so obvious that we don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>discuss it. But it&rsquo;s not so obvious that it&rsquo;s not taking place. It&rsquo;s happening. It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening. You know, what I find the most disappointing about the whole Netflix situation is</p>
<p>I thought Dave Chappelle, you know, even though maybe the special wasn&rsquo;t as funny as other ones,</p>
<p>I thought it made you think in such a incredible way. And I was actually read that I looked up the</p>
<p>transcript, and I read the transcript, so I could think more about it, and try to form an opinion</p>
<p>about this turf issue and trans people and, you know, people punching up punching down and comedy,</p>
<p>it made me think. And then the entire discussion about this is just people walking out and</p>
<p>no discussion about what he actually said. And that to me is just a little bit of a tell like</p>
<p>if you are so upset about what he said, well, where is the transcript of what he said, break</p>
<p>it down sentence by sentence and tell us exactly what he got wrong and why so that we can continue</p>
<p>the discussion. The Netflix walkout and how this thing has unfolded. The reason it&rsquo;s so unproductive</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re not moving the discussion forward. They&rsquo;re not actually listening to what</p>
<p>Chappelle said. And spoiler alert, if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, I&rsquo;m going to talk a little bit about</p>
<p>the what was in it. He talked about his friendship with a trans person who was a comedian, and how he</p>
<p>and she had these incredible discussions and learned a lot from each other and how she was</p>
<p>dragged on Twitter, and a lot of tragic outcomes. And I&rsquo;ll leave it at that. But there was no</p>
<p>discussion about his relationship with that woman who had a tragic fate. And the substance of what</p>
<p>he said, Did you notice that come off that there&rsquo;s no discussion about the actual words and</p>
<p>points that Dave Chappelle made that shows you that this is a disingenuous or a broken discussion?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just I just think that the problems that we have as a society are really big.</p>
<p>Friedberg talked about it, we have inequality problems, we have climate change problems.</p>
<p>You know, we have problems of sort of like systemic health issues. These are all fixable.</p>
<p>And I think that this other stuff is getting in the way of people getting organized to solve those</p>
<p>issues. 100%. And I think that that frustrates me, I would have really, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s views on affirmative action. Let me just be clear. I&rsquo;m kind of, I think, on the margins,</p>
<p>affirmative action is actually, it levels the playing field. And so I support it. But I also</p>
<p>sort of the fact that if this guy is a brilliant geophysicist, and he&rsquo;s already proven that I would</p>
<p>want my kids to be taught climate science from him. Sure. I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>to try to like peddle his affirmative action views, you know, to a bunch of other physicists.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing. No, that&rsquo;s not what he&rsquo;s celebrated life&rsquo;s work. And so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care. I would want all of those really brilliant kids at MIT to have to be one step</p>
<p>closer to proposing a solution to climate change. I think that&rsquo;s a pervasive global issue.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have the ability to prioritize these things. And, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>sad. We&rsquo;re not gonna have an honest conversation about climate change, because we can&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>expert give us talk. And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re to Jason&rsquo;s point, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re having an</p>
<p>honest conversation about the Chappelle special. I don&rsquo;t think any of us believe that Chappelle</p>
<p>hates LGBTQ people, or I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the audience thinks that and I think you have to</p>
<p>deliberately misinterpret what Chappelle is thinking or saying in order to believe</p>
<p>that his message is hate. I don&rsquo;t think it is. Now, what I think the Chappelle special represents</p>
<p>a threat to is perhaps this idea of intersectionality that all of these oppressed</p>
<p>groups have to be on the same team. What he seems to be saying is there&rsquo;s a group</p>
<p>of what he&rsquo;s kind of making fun of is that there&rsquo;s this group of sort of pampered, rich, white,</p>
<p>LGBTQ people who have made enormous progress. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t he say at one point in the special</p>
<p>that, you know, I wish my community, you know, black people could have made as much progress</p>
<p>in 40 years in terms of acceptance as this group has. And yet this group now wants us to</p>
<p>immediately adopt all of their language and sensibilities and punches down, talks down to us</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t. I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of the point he&rsquo;s making is he&rsquo;s kind of revealing a little</p>
<p>bit of a rift between these between these two groups that are supposed to, by the way,</p>
<p>if you saw the clip of the protest, that rift was actually in display, because everybody got</p>
<p>confused about what they were supposed to support, because you had one set of chance, and then you</p>
<p>had jokes are funny chance. And then you had BLM chance from completely different cohorts of people.</p>
<p>And it just became a chaos. Well, I mean, everybody&rsquo;s opinion must be put through the lens</p>
<p>of how many oppressed groups they&rsquo;re from, you know, obesity, I&rsquo;m black, I&rsquo;m gay, I&rsquo;m trans, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>short, whatever. I mean, like, how do we have, how do you even navigate a discussion</p>
<p>intelligently? If I have to say, okay, you&rsquo;re Sri Lankan, but you&rsquo;re rich Chamath and Friedberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got Asperger&rsquo;s, but he&rsquo;s really smart about what I mean, it&rsquo;s like, just make your point. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>have an honest discussion about it. And why are we so upset about this special, when in China,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve got a million people, Uyghurs being sterilized and tortured. And then I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you saw this week, Xi Jinping is saying, like, he wants to get rid of the sissy people,</p>
<p>a sissy man in is a term he&rsquo;s using in China, right? They literally</p>
<p>media rules against effeminate men. Yeah, I mean, well, why are we not protesting that?</p>
<p>Well, we saw this in the Middle East as well. The real threat to LGBTQ people</p>
<p>are these authoritarian governments that really want to oppress, you know,</p>
<p>and murder gay people. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, Chappelle is not the threat. I think,</p>
<p>I think Chappelle had to be silenced because what he&rsquo;s saying is actually very heretical</p>
<p>to the progressive left, which is that not all of these groups are on the same page. And they,</p>
<p>again, they believe in this idea of intersectionality, that all of these groups</p>
<p>have to basically be on the same page. And actually, the more oppressed groups that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>part of, the more elevated you are. And so this idea that there could be a schism actually is</p>
<p>something they want to silence. Yeah, I mean, Chappelle&rsquo;s quote, I don&rsquo;t disagree with the</p>
<p>trans movement. I just agree with the way they&rsquo;re going about it was his kind of point. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again, let me speak on as a, as a, as a colored person who grew up in a minority family,</p>
<p>you know, I would love to tell you that my parents were super, super open minded,</p>
<p>but that would be a lie. And, you know, I love them to death. And I think they tried their best.</p>
<p>But you know, they came with a ton of fucking baggage, and a ton of stereotypes. And you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that my parents would have been the most supportive of other minorities,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s color or sexual orientation or ever, and it was a it was a lot of like,</p>
<p>very complicated conversations to explain to them how to see the world differently. And,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s what happened when you pluck them out of a third world country and drop them</p>
<p>into Canada. And, you know, I think that my parents came far a very long way. I remember,</p>
<p>you know, when when I first started, you know, dating my ex wife, it&rsquo;s like, it was a very</p>
<p>complicated thing for them to see me dating an Asian woman. Very complicated. They didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand. And then it was like, Well, do you do you want me to marry or date Sri Lankan? And</p>
<p>they were like, Yes, but as long as she&rsquo;s not Muslim, and it&rsquo;s like, What the hell are you</p>
<p>are you saying this? And, and so I&rsquo;m just trying to tell you that this idea of intersectionality,</p>
<p>it does play out in a lot of our lives, because we all come from families, especially our aging</p>
<p>parents. Oh, my God. Yeah. Our grandparents, there were some, I mean, I love my parents. I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>honest with you. They&rsquo;re, you know, they try their best, but man, the thing that&rsquo;s gotten me</p>
<p>particularly saddened or tilted, or just, you know, the thing that just sort of hits me is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made so much progress in so many ways as a society, yet we don&rsquo;t celebrate that. And we</p>
<p>seem incredibly focused on marginal issues, to your point, Chamath, that are not global warming,</p>
<p>that are not education, that are that are not, you know, international relations and geopolitics,</p>
<p>you know, like there&rsquo;s economic empowerment, there&rsquo;s so many things that we could be focused</p>
<p>on that would actually make change that arguing about</p>
<p>and it would unite Kevin Hart on the office, you know, but it would unite people. That&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>guess. So that&rsquo;s what I think is such a great opportunity. If we all collectively came together</p>
<p>and focused on a bigger enemy, right, climate change, climate change, governments, I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d find much more accepting of each other, because we would have a common shared goal.</p>
<p>And then we would find commonality and achieving it.</p>
<p>Yeah. So Jake, Bill Maher invented a word to describe what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is progressive phobia, which is it&rsquo;s the reluctance to admit any progress because of the</p>
<p>fear that if you do admit progress, then that means that you will lack a justification for</p>
<p>all these, you know, progressive programs that people want. And so they have to make</p>
<p>the situations always seem as dire as possible in order to scare people into a certain agenda.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s a, you know, unwillingness to admit how much progress we&rsquo;ve made in so many</p>
<p>areas. The time they tried to cancel me was because I said on Twitter, isn&rsquo;t it amazing that</p>
<p>every single skill you want to learn right now, and including the high paying jobs is now available</p>
<p>for free on MIT courseware, and anybody can learn this stuff for free. And you used to have to pay</p>
<p>$50,000 a year and get accepted into these, you know, Ivy League programs. But now all that</p>
<p>information is free. And all we need to do is expose people to it and give them the motivation,</p>
<p>the time to do and they were like, How could you say that, you know, people are not able to do it.</p>
<p>And I was like, and then a bunch of people replied, who were people of color or people who</p>
<p>were poor and said, I actually learned to code on the MIT website, I learned artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>I learned, I got my degree in, you know, social media marketing, or whatever at this website,</p>
<p>you to me that website, other treehouse. And all these people were saying, Yeah, I learned all</p>
<p>these skills. And I went from making working at Walmart to making 60k a year 70k a year. And</p>
<p>then there was this big fight, like, are you going to cancel me for saying there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>opportunity now than ever. And I hold that position, there is more opportunity now for</p>
<p>you to learn a skill and get a high paying job than in the history of humanity. The system is</p>
<p>more fair now than ever. Yeah, I was gonna say with that, in the in the world of in the world of</p>
<p>progress, there are some amazing innovations every day this week. And I put this in the chat,</p>
<p>and Nick, you can post the article. There was a gentleman in at the NYC and NYU Langone Center of</p>
<p>Medicine, who transplanted a pig kidney into a human and had that human kidney or basically had</p>
<p>that pig kidney not get rejected. Now, this was a person that was brain dead. And I guess, you know,</p>
<p>the family, you know, God bless them, donated this person&rsquo;s body to science effectively,</p>
<p>they were kept alive, but then they were able to transplant the kidney in. And they were able</p>
<p>to see the urine production and creatinine production. And all of a sudden, now,</p>
<p>there is a chance that we could actually use pigs, genetically engineered pigs,</p>
<p>as a basis for us to basically get kidneys, hearts, lungs. That is incredible.</p>
<p>Freebird. So to your point, Saks, that is happening still every day. And we don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>enough about it, because we&rsquo;re up in arms about Dave Chabot.</p>
<p>Freebird, tell us, you know, if that in 10 years, what that looks like,</p>
<p>and the impact it has on society, if we take that pig transplant, and we just 10x it from now,</p>
<p>put a couple billion dollars behind it, what does it look like in a decade?</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s other techniques that are being developed that you could actually</p>
<p>generate actual human organs, using, you know, basis of induced, these induced pluripotent stem</p>
<p>cells. And regardless of the path, I do think like availability of organ transplants is going to</p>
<p>go up like crazy. The big infrastructure and technical challenge we still face is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to build these GMP facilities to make all of these cell-based therapies,</p>
<p>not just organs, but also other cell-based therapies that are becoming the mainstay of</p>
<p>the future of medicine, personalized medicine for humans. And so, there&rsquo;s also this tremendous</p>
<p>infrastructure opportunity. We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about infrastructure in biomanufacturing broadly,</p>
<p>and other life sciences opportunities, but there&rsquo;s a tremendous infrastructure opportunity</p>
<p>to build out facilities that can produce these therapies. And the therapy can be an organ or</p>
<p>a cell-based therapy that can target cancer in your body or what have you. And so, you can kind</p>
<p>of think about, look, we&rsquo;ve resolved the science. Now we&rsquo;ve also resolved the engineering. The next</p>
<p>step is to build it, right? And so, this is like, you know, the build decade or the build decades</p>
<p>globally for where the intersection of software and biology has enabled these incredible breakthroughs</p>
<p>in human health and manufacturing and food. And now the infrastructure needs are there. I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>this before, I do think this is where we have the biggest gap in terms of infrastructure needs</p>
<p>and the biggest opportunity to kind of fill those needs. And if I were to kind of be in Congress or</p>
<p>be president, I would say this is the number one priority for an infrastructure bill. Because once</p>
<p>you get this going, it&rsquo;s going to change lives and it&rsquo;s going to change the economy.</p>
<p>So, high speed rail, costing us 50 billion, 100 billion versus this.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. We could build a bunch of GMC facilities or a bunch of biomanufacturing</p>
<p>facilities, a lot of stuff that we could build that would, you know, pay back within years</p>
<p>and have a huge outcome. Private markets maybe will meet this demand, but I think you gotta</p>
<p>you gotta kickstart this stuff. The economics are going to be unfeasible for a while.</p>
<p>If you want to get a CAR T therapy, which is a type of therapy that&rsquo;s personal, you know,</p>
<p>personalized CAR T therapies today, your cost is about $450,000. You know, a local university here,</p>
<p>I was speaking with one of their lead doctors the other day, they built their own GMP facility</p>
<p>at a cost of $50 million and they can now get the therapies down to $40,000 per patient.</p>
<p>But they can only serve 250 patients a year using that kind of 90% cost reduction.</p>
<p>So, you can kind of see like, as you build these systems, and this is built locally by</p>
<p>a university, right? It&rsquo;s not built for industrial scale. These guys aren&rsquo;t commercial operators on</p>
<p>these facilities. So, if you start to build these facilities from a commercial point of view,</p>
<p>and you can bootstrap some of these things and this infrastructure costs,</p>
<p>very quickly, the cost becomes so low that you see these technologies proliferate.</p>
<p>And I think we should see that both, you know, this organ transplant one is a great case study,</p>
<p>cell based therapies, biomanufacturing, all sorts of opportunity.</p>
<p>You keep saying GMP facility.</p>
<p>Sorry, good manufacturing. Yeah, it&rsquo;s, you know, if you&rsquo;re gonna make cells that are gonna go in</p>
<p>your body, there&rsquo;s incredibly stringent requirements on the safety and the cleanliness</p>
<p>and the practices that go on in that facility. So, these quote unquote, GMP facilities have a very</p>
<p>specific criteria of how you how you build and how you operate them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just highly, they&rsquo;re high quality facilities is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, think about like a clean room to make semiconductors, except in this case,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making cells that you&rsquo;re putting in your body. So, you got to be really careful.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, it&rsquo;s been 70 minutes, 75 minutes, 80 minutes. Anybody have any last</p>
<p>minute plugs for products that they want to disguise as a compliment to another bestie?</p>
<p>I still think we should launch bestie coin, the all in coin and monetize the online podcast. We</p>
<p>were talking about this at poker last night. No monetization.</p>
<p>NFTs.</p>
<p>No, bestie. Bestie coin would be incredible.</p>
<p>I think I want to tell you about this guy, Lee Jackie, who&rsquo;s known as the lipstick king in China.</p>
<p>He did a 12 hour live stream on Wednesday on Taobao. 250 million people tuned in he sold</p>
<p>$1.7 billion a product. So basically the equivalent of the entire adult population</p>
<p>in America. Watch this. Isn&rsquo;t that incredible? That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That is just incredible. So that&rsquo;s QVC. And as if in two and a half times the people who watch</p>
<p>the Super Bowl, it&rsquo;s two and a half Super Bowls Jackie, the lipstick king, the lipstick king.</p>
<p>Guys, we haven&rsquo;t had Monty on the show in a while. Let me bring him up. Oh,</p>
<p>Monty. Get him to the mic. Oh, Monty. Yeah. Anything you want to say?</p>
<p>Some Monty fan service. For those of you asking about the all in summit, we are looking at</p>
<p>locations in Miami. And we will have news shortly. If you want to sign up for the email,</p>
<p>when are we doing this thing? We&rsquo;re gonna look at March, April, May,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna do a we&rsquo;re gonna do an LA show in January.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do a live all in podcast at the upfront summit, Mark sisters event in LA.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like a closed event. And then the all in summit, you can go sign up for email updates,</p>
<p>summit.all in podcast.co summit.all in podcast.co. We&rsquo;re not looking for volunteers. We&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking for event planners. We have all the spaces in Miami, we could possibly know every</p>
<p>single person&rsquo;s email just thanks to the fans for giving us every piece of information. Right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just about dates, dates, dates, we got to find a two day date. And then whatever place we</p>
<p>use like Faina, the new world, the Jackie Gleason theater, there&rsquo;s so many great facilities there</p>
<p>that have reached out to us. Once we pick the facility, we&rsquo;ll know what the facility capacity</p>
<p>is. Some of them can fit 2000 people, some can fit 250. When we figure that out, then we&rsquo;ll figure</p>
<p>out ticketing and get people there this time next week, both Friedberg and I may have kids.</p>
<p>Ah, it&rsquo;s muscle. So are we are we skipping next week?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m actually not giving birth. I don&rsquo;t know about you. But</p>
<p>no, we got to get pictures. And yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be incredible. Well, congratulations,</p>
<p>guys. And if this Africa trip is coming, I was Africa trip is happening.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait. Do you what countries are you thinking about tagging along?</p>
<p>Of course. This is my life. I have my own. What&rsquo;s the point of having my own schedule</p>
<p>and a bunch of powerful friends who are traveling the world doing interesting shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the ultimate wingman.</p>
<p>Your motto is private jet will travel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a wingman, professional wingman as a service.</p>
<p>Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, and there may be a couple of other wingman as a service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if you need to somebody fun with you for a couple of, you know, touchdowns, takeoffs,</p>
<p>wingman as a service.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s leaving with something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring Sonny as my body double.</p>
<p>Send Sonny in another escalade.</p>
<p>Paparazzi follow him and then we go to a little</p>
<p>Honda Accord and you go to the actual events.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait. Actually, I&rsquo;m super excited.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s gonna be fun. Yeah, man, get your passport. Let&rsquo;s get to cut deck of cards.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, you know, that&rsquo;ll be great. You can we can do a couple of fireside chats,</p>
<p>big fireside chats.</p>
<p>100% will take it on the road.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>All right, boys, I love you.</p>
<p>Good luck, bro. Good luck.</p>
<p>And for the Queen of Kenoa, Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, West.</p>
<p>The Queen of Kenoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that we just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet the beak.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
