    <p>Hi friends, this episode is gonna be a fucking whirlwind. I don&rsquo;t have a notebook. I don&rsquo;t have this planned out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s about to come out of my mouth, but I just need to get on here and vent a little I</p>
<p>Need to talk to my friends. I need to talk to the people that fucking get the way my brain works</p>
<p>because I</p>
<p>Had some real big like things to face last night with myself</p>
<p>And I have some realizations and bitch when I tell you I had my first like</p>
<p>Full-on</p>
<p>Emotional breakdown couldn&rsquo;t control it couldn&rsquo;t stop it panic like I had that for the first time</p>
<p>Since I can remember like I don&rsquo;t ever remember having a panic or like what is it called?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just a fucking breakdown. You just can&rsquo;t stop and it&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re panicked and you&rsquo;re freaking the fuck out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever having that but bitch last night. I had that</p>
<p>Just because this fucking boy Instagram messaged me</p>
<p>Okay, I had to make myself laugh so I didn&rsquo;t get sad but I</p>
<p>Had to be accountable and call myself out on some shit</p>
<p>Like I always preach accountability in my podcast and I want y&rsquo;all to know I&rsquo;d be the main one</p>
<p>Doing the shit like I do it too. It sucks for me, too. So I&rsquo;m gonna go into the realizations I had last night and</p>
<p>Break some shit down, but I&rsquo;m gonna be like vulnerable with you guys and I&rsquo;m gonna be really honest about what I realized</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Kind of like the lies I&rsquo;ve been telling myself and I like I had to face some scary fucking shit</p>
<p>And I had to go into a lot of hopelessness and it scared the fuck out of me</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m about to go to Cabo. Oh, so when you listen to this, I&rsquo;ll be in Cabo, but I&rsquo;m filming this or recording this on</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>March 22nd, so like hi</p>
<p>me from the future</p>
<p>But yes, I have to pre-record because I&rsquo;m going to Cabo with a couple friends for like a week</p>
<p>I had a whole separate episode planned like I had a whole</p>
<p>Fucking like thing I was gonna make and like have it done and be like cute about it</p>
<p>You know and just schedule it and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>but after last night, I feel like I had the realizations and the awareness that I had because</p>
<p>it was meant to be shared and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even give a fuck if it was meant to or not meant to</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to say is gonna be able to help every single person listens to this podcast and I&rsquo;m not trying to be cocky</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just very upset and I need to feel like it&rsquo;s for something</p>
<p>But I feel like this will be a great way for us to kind of connect about her</p>
<p>You know, like, you know when you listen to a podcast and you just want to be like knowing the host like I&rsquo;d be nosy</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna get</p>
<p>Vulnerable with you guys and let you in a little bit into my life and what the fuck be going on</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s lessons in it. There&rsquo;d be a whole fuck of PowerPoint</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that you&rsquo;re gonna realize along the way with me. So</p>
<p>Huh, let&rsquo;s do this shit, I guess</p>
<p>so my first like</p>
<p>Earth-shattering fucking realization was about dating. So if you&rsquo;ve listened to my previous podcasts</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m someone that I just don&rsquo;t choose to date. I don&rsquo;t want to date. I don&rsquo;t put effort into dating</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to date. I don&rsquo;t try to find anyone. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about getting attention from people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something I care about and</p>
<p>I realized I&rsquo;ve been lying to myself about that</p>
<p>like I actually do want a relationship and I would like to be in one and I&rsquo;m down for taking on the challenge of</p>
<p>working with myself with like what comes up and the problems that arise like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Willing to work through that and like grow with myself and with someone but for so long</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just felt like I&rsquo;m never gonna meet someone that I&rsquo;m interested in or that I like like no one</p>
<p>Grabs my interest. No one can hold my attention</p>
<p>For more than two seconds, like it&rsquo;s really easy to get my attention real fucking easy. Like I&rsquo;ll look at people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my interest but it&rsquo;s very hard to keep my interest like I will lose it in 30 fucking seconds</p>
<p>Not even I&rsquo;ll lose it in 0.2 seconds. If you say or do something wrong, like I&rsquo;m very picky. I&rsquo;m very judgy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very like</p>
<p>Guarded extremely fucking guarded and I&rsquo;m not picky because I think I&rsquo;m better than everybody. I&rsquo;m tired of fucking being hurt</p>
<p>So I screen people</p>
<p>To like the nth fucking degree before I let you near me or let you close to me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna look for every potential thing that could fucking hurt me before I let you near me</p>
<p>Like I keep people at a distance. That&rsquo;s just what I fucking do and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told myself this entire time. No, I don&rsquo;t want a relationship</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to be single. But the truth is I&rsquo;m so fucking hopeless and I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll ever find someone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve just decided. Okay, I&rsquo;m not gonna date but I&rsquo;ve kind of blinded myself to that</p>
<p>So when I look at the way I&rsquo;m feeling about people in general</p>
<p>looks are</p>
<p>Important you got to have looks you got to be fucking cute</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>But I require so much more than just being cute like you got to be with it</p>
<p>you got to be like mentally be able to hold a conversation with me which is a</p>
<p>task and a chore for most and a lot of shit as goes over people&rsquo;s fucking head like I&rsquo;m a very deep person and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to find people that can get to that level. They&rsquo;re out there, but my</p>
<p>preferences and my everything that goes along with that like it just</p>
<p>Makes my pool my on my option pool. Is that the fucking word? I don&rsquo;t know. It makes it so small</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve just felt so hopeless like it&rsquo;s not out there and</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Realized the way that I&rsquo;ve escaped feeling hopeless and feeling powerless is</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>Telling myself I&rsquo;m making the choice to stay single</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been riding that fucking wave and telling myself that I&rsquo;m choosing to stay single when in reality</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fucking scared. I&rsquo;m not gonna find anyone and</p>
<p>Telling myself I&rsquo;m choosing to stay single</p>
<p>Makes me feel more empowered and more in control than saying I&rsquo;m terrified. I&rsquo;ll never find anyone</p>
<p>So I did have to call myself out on that and I had to own up to that and it makes sense and I understand</p>
<p>Myself and it&rsquo;s worked until now because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deny and I&rsquo;m not a person that does deny the way that I feel if I feel something I feel it and</p>
<p>The feelings of like wanting someone have been coming up and I&rsquo;ve been trying to like dodge them like a fucking dodgeball</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t like they&rsquo;re just coming up and I&rsquo;m like fuck. Okay, this is what we&rsquo;re gonna have to do now</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m the type when I have something I want I&rsquo;m gonna go for it</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m having to realize a lot of things in the process of going for it and it hurts like fucking hell</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a good feeling to feel like okay. My standards are so high</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna find anyone like that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been at. I&rsquo;m like, well, I&rsquo;m not gonna lower my fucking standards. I&rsquo;ll be damned</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather be alone. So that&rsquo;s kind of how I&rsquo;ve convinced myself is like, I&rsquo;m gonna just be a single fucking dickhead, you know</p>
<p>but I kind of also convinced myself like what I want is not out there and</p>
<p>then this fucking guy on Instagram messaged me and</p>
<p>He is got a lot of followers like over 3 million and</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like so fucking attractive like so perfect</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never like seen nobody look like that before, you know, like on Instagram like everybody look like I don&rsquo;t fucking Instagram but like</p>
<p>My first thought was why the fuck are you messaging me? What the fuck do you want?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very defensive and that&rsquo;s one thing about me is I&rsquo;m a petty fuck</p>
<p>So if people have a lot of followers or they&rsquo;re verified or they&rsquo;re famous or whatever it is</p>
<p>And they DM me like I have people DM me all the time that are like big and I don&rsquo;t accept the message</p>
<p>Because most of the time they&rsquo;re just trying to like</p>
<p>Sexualize me and that will make me lose interest in a split fucking second</p>
<p>So when people reach out to me if they&rsquo;re like famous or whatever, I will never act like they&rsquo;re a big deal</p>
<p>I will never give them the satisfaction of thinking that I&rsquo;m like fangirling or that I like them or that</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something fucking special. I look at you like a human being and I play an ego game</p>
<p>I play a fat fucking ego game and I will some of the I die</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of porn stars gay porn stars trying to fuck that are in my DMS</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a more people than you can imagine in my fucking DMS that haven&rsquo;t even had like an accepted message. So</p>
<p>The people that I have accepted their messages some people are annoying the fuck out of me, but I can&rsquo;t like unaccept it</p>
<p>You know, so it&rsquo;s like I their messages notify me and I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>notifications, so like</p>
<p>Whatever. My point is people that sexualize me. I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck to entertain your conversation</p>
<p>People message me all the time. Hey</p>
<p>Like guys will just message me. Hey, and I don&rsquo;t even accept the message</p>
<p>What the fuck am I gonna do with a hey you dumb shit?</p>
<p>It just shows like you think you&rsquo;re gonna come at somebody like me with the fucking</p>
<p>Hey one, you ain&rsquo;t cute enough to be doing that and two I need more mental stimulation. You better make me fucking giggle</p>
<p>Okay, within the first two seconds of me reading your fucking message or I&rsquo;m bored</p>
<p>I have no interest</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like gay guys like guys that are interested in me and trying to like flirt and shit cuz I like all my</p>
<p>Pictures and I want to message me. Hey girl stay and fucking requested. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that as boring doesn&rsquo;t catch my attention</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s another thing that has made me so hopeless about finding</p>
<p>Someone is everybody is sex sex sex sex sex sex sex and I&rsquo;m fucking sick of it</p>
<p>If you sexualize me don&rsquo;t fucking message me. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck who you are</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you&rsquo;re the Pope</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you&rsquo;re the richest person in the world do not</p>
<p>Motherfucking sexualize me. I will not open your fucking message. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that. If you want to tell me I&rsquo;m cute</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attractive. Thanks, but don&rsquo;t fucking try to sexualize me right off the bat</p>
<p>The least fucking interesting thing about me is the way I look and how big my fucking dick is. All right, I know it&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident in it, but that&rsquo;s the least fucking interesting thing about me my body</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t even that great like it&rsquo;s cool good, whatever, but</p>
<p>My appearance is the like least interesting thing about me</p>
<p>So the people that go just for that I see how fucking stupid you are. You&rsquo;re superficial and you&rsquo;re dumb and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been like</p>
<p>Interacting with is these dumbass fucking people. So that&rsquo;s just shot my hope down for thinking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find someone any like way worse, you know</p>
<p>But back to this boy that messaged me</p>
<p>He fucking messages me and sends me one of my life coach tick tocks and like where I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>Validating yourself and like repairing your relationship with yourself and</p>
<p>He sent me a message</p>
<p>Acknowledging something that I was saying and saying that he appreciated it</p>
<p>That is the only reason I fucking responded to him. But my first thought was still motherfucker</p>
<p>Why are you messaging me? Like look at you and look at me. Why the fuck are you messaging me?</p>
<p>I messaged him back and then we ended up like</p>
<p>Messaging all fucking day and</p>
<p>Something I don&rsquo;t do is get giddy over people. I don&rsquo;t get excited by anybody. I don&rsquo;t get fucking I don&rsquo;t look for nobody&rsquo;s message</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck like I&rsquo;m not impressed by anybody</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give two shits</p>
<p>But this boy had me giddy as fuck and like the conversation we were holding was so cute and we were just like bantering back</p>
<p>And forth but like homeboys with it and he did not fucking sexualize me one time</p>
<p>He complimented me and made sure that I knew he like he thought I was attractive</p>
<p>He did great on that and I did it back like I reciprocated it because I fucking like his ass, duh</p>
<p>but the conversation never went sexual and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what kept both of us</p>
<p>Interested because we even talked about it. Like I&rsquo;m dealing with being sexualized on a smaller scale than he is</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t imagine how fucking hopeless he&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s got it at such a bigger scale than me, but he&rsquo;s also aware like pretty people that are fucking asleep. Whatever</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll wake up in time, but someone that&rsquo;s aware that&rsquo;s experiencing all this</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just can&rsquo;t imagine how hopeless he is because I&rsquo;m only getting like a tiny bit</p>
<p>Compared to what the fuck he&rsquo;s getting like that stressed me out to just think about it</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s feeling the exact same fucking way I&rsquo;m feeling and everything about me in that moment and</p>
<p>like my worth and my value was reflected to me and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what caused me to have the full fucking breakdown was I did not know what to do and I fucking</p>
<p>panicked like he doesn&rsquo;t know this and I hope he never fuckers listens to this goddamn podcast, but this man has</p>
<p>Changed me and given me something I will cherish forever like the realization</p>
<p>I had like even if he fucking goes to me and we never talk again or</p>
<p>Whatever like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck because what I&rsquo;ve taken from it and the like the gift he gave me of validating</p>
<p>my worth was like I would give anything for it and</p>
<p>I will always be appreciative of it</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t explain to you how good it felt, but it sent me into a fucking spiral because</p>
<p>He was interested and what was coming out of my mouth</p>
<p>Like I said, I haven&rsquo;t been experiencing that</p>
<p>So I grew up</p>
<p>kind of weird</p>
<p>With like school and shit. Like I was bullied really bad in school. But like even with like my family</p>
<p>I always felt annoying. I always felt like a nuisance. I felt like nobody cared what I had to say</p>
<p>I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t important</p>
<p>I was just supposed to like sit there and shut up and like be to the side and just like</p>
<p>Shut up, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me a long time to even get to where I&rsquo;m at now to think that people even give a fuck to hear what I</p>
<p>have to say to even think that what I have to say is valuable and that people would want to listen like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a hard road with that shit. I know a lot of people deal with that</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m opening up about it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life feeling like people don&rsquo;t see what the fuck is in front of them</p>
<p>Like I was always able to see my value and how I could be so like</p>
<p>Useful to somebody and how I could be there for them and how they should like I&rsquo;ve made it so fucking easy to love me</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>No one ever picked me. No one ever wanted me. No one ever looked like</p>
<p>Twice at me and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>anyone</p>
<p>so parents friends like that shit growing up was fucking like rough and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you ever get over like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>Fully get through, you know, like I can heal from it</p>
<p>I can like grow from it, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>Be able to like kick that like that insecurity is always just gonna be in me</p>
<p>But this is the first time I felt like someone has seen what the fuck is in front of their face</p>
<p>So he was able to appreciate my brain and the way I am</p>
<p>Immediately like he saw it instantly like yeah, I look the way I do like I think I this is the thing</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even say I think I&rsquo;m attractive because</p>
<p>Growing up. I fucking wasn&rsquo;t I was ugly and fat and I got my ass fucking bullied. I</p>
<p>hate to even fucking say that because</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t understand the extent to where I was like with to which I was bullied</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m cute, but I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life</p>
<p>Surrounded by people that don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m fucking cute. So my entire life was a fucking gaslight for a long time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I felt cute</p>
<p>But I was being reflected that I was fucking nothing and that I was ugly and useless and people were always like nitpicking shit. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like I&rsquo;m on a comfortable place with the way I look now like I&rsquo;m confident in the way that I look I like</p>
<p>The way that I look I think I&rsquo;m cute</p>
<p>It still makes me cringe to fucking say that but I think I&rsquo;m like decent</p>
<p>But like I said when this guy messaged me I said well, what the fuck are you trying to do with me?</p>
<p>What the fuck do you want from me? And I realized in that moment</p>
<p>What I lack in appearance I make up for in</p>
<p>Personality and knowledge. So it kind of made me realize like I&rsquo;m on this dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>level in a way</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t look fucking near as good as he does</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m able to like compensate in other areas that</p>
<p>Make me worth talking to for him like he gives a fuck what I have to say</p>
<p>He sees how I&rsquo;m valuable and is able to appreciate me like this is the first time</p>
<p>I feel like a motherfucker is standing in front of me and can like</p>
<p>See what&rsquo;s in front of them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nicest feeling but it&rsquo;s the biggest mind fuck. So</p>
<p>my whole like breakdown about</p>
<p>realizing all of this it&rsquo;s like I was already feeling hopeless and</p>
<p>I was never gonna find anyone, you know with my standards already set where they were</p>
<p>And my standards weren&rsquo;t even that fucking high</p>
<p>but after interacting with this guy and being appreciated by someone that I think highly of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer gonna be able to be impressed by the standards I had already set</p>
<p>Now the standards have skyrocketed</p>
<p>When I realized that like I&rsquo;m never gonna be impressed by anyone ever fucking again unless you&rsquo;re on his level</p>
<p>But people on his level are like once in a lifetime that are aware</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s fucking hot. Everybody has fucking money nowadays, but he&rsquo;s talented and he&rsquo;s fucking with it mentally and he&rsquo;s hot like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>All of it and it&rsquo;s like to come across that it&rsquo;s like I already thought I was doomed of before</p>
<p>but now I just experienced like</p>
<p>What I really should fucking be trying to get and</p>
<p>Not like it was just an impending sense of fucking doom. Like I just felt like</p>
<p>isolation utter hopelessness</p>
<p>like anything I felt before was times a hundred and it was like right in front of my face and I broke the fuck down and</p>
<p>I could not stop like it&rsquo;s kind of a curse. It&rsquo;s such a curse to be</p>
<p>attractive and</p>
<p>Be aware because someone like him</p>
<p>He is surrounded by pretty people from what he does</p>
<p>He like his modeling shit like he&rsquo;s surrounded by pretty fucking people by rich people</p>
<p>by like all these fucking people all the time and</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still looking for</p>
<p>Someone like me like I am about to fucking start crying again like a bitch. We&rsquo;re not gonna fucking do that</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s around all these hot people and successful people all the time, but he&rsquo;s still looking for more</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking for exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for in like a person and it&rsquo;s just fucking insane</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so weird that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>It in a way like I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s fucking better people, but there I go again with my fucking whatever shut up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just still kind of bugging out. I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to go forward from here, but I&rsquo;m fucking scared</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t say that ever and like this boy messaging me it was like the greatest gift but the biggest fucking curse</p>
<p>because now I know it&rsquo;s out there and</p>
<p>Now I know the people that are gonna like see my value and appreciate me</p>
<p>Truly are on such a higher fucking level than I thought and I&rsquo;m just like goddamn</p>
<p>Like I am so scared. Like how do I get there?</p>
<p>How do I access those people because if they&rsquo;re the ones that are able to appreciate me, how do I get to them like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how to access this level of people. I don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I finally see that it&rsquo;s out there and I&rsquo;m like, okay. I know that like it&rsquo;s there it exists</p>
<p>I just need to be shooting higher. I don&rsquo;t know where the fuck to shoot. I don&rsquo;t know where to go</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to even get in</p>
<p>Contact with them or like how do you even fucking know because like looking at his fucking page you wouldn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s with it</p>
<p>But the only reason I realized he&rsquo;s with it is because we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like damn but like anybody else I give a chance to there a fucking box of rocks</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stupid as shit and I lose interest in two seconds, but</p>
<p>Yo, like I&rsquo;m just frustrated and I&rsquo;m fucking sad and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Appreciative but I&rsquo;m like devastated and I&rsquo;m just like what the fuck do I do now?</p>
<p>what the fuck am I supposed to do now because I was able to like</p>
<p>Entertain people a little bit and like feel like yeah, but now I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about anybody</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not on his level</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like me like I don&rsquo;t give a shit because like if I&rsquo;m able to connect with someone that I see like that</p>
<p>Then they see something in me that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen yet because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering like what the fuck do you want me for?</p>
<p>You know, like I get that I&rsquo;m like with it mentally, but like is that enough?</p>
<p>I get I am like who I am and how I am but like</p>
<p>Have never felt like enough. I can&rsquo;t fathom how it&rsquo;s enough. I can&rsquo;t fathom why the fuck you would want me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna be really honest with you guys. That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m fucking feeling</p>
<p>so I guess</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s seeing shit that I&rsquo;m not seeing but it takes someone of a certain caliber to be able to recognize it</p>
<p>I I believe that wholeheartedly</p>
<p>but the other thing I realized about him is like the fact that he&rsquo;s able to appreciate me for like the shit that I say</p>
<p>And how my brain works and he&rsquo;s able to compliment me on my brain and the ideas</p>
<p>I suggest like it just makes me so much more appreciative</p>
<p>toward him and</p>
<p>It makes me want you even more like the fact that you want me makes me want you and the fact that you can fully</p>
<p>Accept and like appreciate</p>
<p>Me makes me want you even more because for you to be able to appreciate me</p>
<p>You have to be fucking deep as shit for you to be able to appreciate me on the level that he&rsquo;s like talking</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>what the fuck and it&rsquo;s just weird because I</p>
<p>Relate to him on a lot of shit. Like we relate on a lot of things like we&rsquo;re so different</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in two totally different stages in life. He&rsquo;s so much more successful and like so much more</p>
<p>Everything but I&rsquo;m still able to relate to him and that fucked with me. That was weird</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m starting to realize like there must be</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m not seeing about myself that</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seeing and now I&rsquo;m kind of like opening up to like the quest of trying to see it</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna have to let go of all the insecure shit that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking and telling myself before all the behaviors that I&rsquo;ve adopted and things that have like kept me safe with people that made</p>
<p>Me fucking insecure. I&rsquo;m gonna have to get rid of those but that means I&rsquo;m gonna have to make changes to myself and</p>
<p>Completely change my fucking life, which is isolation. It&rsquo;s scary as fuck. That&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Anticipation of death for a human being like I said in the other episode</p>
<p>Connection is the number one priority for a human being so</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>When you start to see your true worth</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to start making changes to your life and</p>
<p>Those changes are gonna scheduling fuck out of you because now that I think</p>
<p>Someone like that</p>
<p>Can appreciate me the people that I think have been appreciating me aren&rsquo;t shit</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just gonna be really fucking honest. It&rsquo;s like the attention I&rsquo;ve been getting like now I&rsquo;m even more unimpressed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, please you have no fucking clue</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just weird because my whole life</p>
<p>I felt like I&rsquo;ve had important things to say but it was never reflected and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Been reflected on my tick-tock and my podcast like once I started sharing</p>
<p>I started to reflect and it was like weird because like I said growing up</p>
<p>I never felt worth the fuck like I felt I could see how I was good enough inside like I could logically see</p>
<p>How these traits about me or how these things or how I could be good enough for someone?</p>
<p>But they just never picked me. So I was reflected that you aren&rsquo;t fucking good enough</p>
<p>So I like stopped believing these things were good about myself. So now I&rsquo;m having to like</p>
<p>Receive them and like reacknowledge them, but I was in the same boat of like, okay. I&rsquo;m starting to see all these things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m acknowledging all these things in myself and I&rsquo;m starting to see how I&rsquo;m like valuable and I&rsquo;m starting to see the impact</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having on people with like my words</p>
<p>but this motherfucker</p>
<p>Talking to me and genuinely taking an interest in getting to know me and just like wanting to have a conversation</p>
<p>That shit validated everything in a way that I can&rsquo;t fucking ignore</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just so obvious in front of my face. Now. There is no second guess there is no</p>
<p>Be insecure anymore. Now. I have to step into the version of me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like next like I have to step into this level up and it&rsquo;s fucking terrifying</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>fucking terrifying</p>
<p>It feels so good that my worth has been validated to this</p>
<p>like extent and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious in front of my face that I cannot even second fucking guess it like it&rsquo;s just so fucking nice</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what to do now</p>
<p>Because I feel like once I realize my value and I fully just accept it and take it the fuck in</p>
<p>Any move I make</p>
<p>After I realize my value all the actions I take that actually reflect</p>
<p>The true way I should have been feeling about myself are gonna lead to isolation</p>
<p>Because the life I have set up for myself right now is not one that reflects the value that I now see</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fine if I have to go back to like being alone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like goddamn like I just I see what&rsquo;s in front of me</p>
<p>I see what&rsquo;s gonna happen when I take this step up on this fucking staircase and I like</p>
<p>Go into the next level of myself the next version of myself</p>
<p>Once I do that</p>
<p>Everything changes because when you step up and you elevate you&rsquo;re gonna see things differently. You&rsquo;re at a different viewpoint</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna see everything fucking different. I&rsquo;m just fucking terrified. Like I know what needs to be done</p>
<p>I know this step needs to be taken. There&rsquo;s just a lot of fucking baggage</p>
<p>I have to leave on this step in order to walk up to the next one and it feels</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m being ripped apart from the fucking inside. That&rsquo;s the way I can explain it</p>
<p>Like it it&rsquo;s fucking weird dude, like it&rsquo;s really fucking weird</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just having to remind myself and reassure myself</p>
<p>this is my egos way and like this is your human fucking way of</p>
<p>Staying alive because if you see disconnection and being isolated as potential death</p>
<p>Everything in your nervous system is gonna try and fucking keep you away from that. So like I&rsquo;m gonna have to</p>
<p>go against the internal fucking wiring of my brain and like I the way that I&rsquo;m feeling is I</p>
<p>Understand it, but I can&rsquo;t not feel it</p>
<p>so like I have to reassure myself as I&rsquo;m like getting ready to fucking take this step that like</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be fucking scared. It&rsquo;s gonna be the scariest fucking shit</p>
<p>You probably ever do to like step into this next version of yourself</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having to like be there for me and it&rsquo;s making me like strengthen my relationship with myself, too</p>
<p>but bro, like this is some next-level fucking shit and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? I&rsquo;m just like stalling and I&rsquo;m dragging my fucking foot to like not take this step</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m standing here with like a bunch of fucking bags</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like weighing me down and I have to let them go to walk up the next one</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just holding on to the bags</p>
<p>Like I just don&rsquo;t want to drop them because I know I&rsquo;m gonna have to take that step I&rsquo;m not the type to</p>
<p>Gain awareness and stay where I&rsquo;m at. I&rsquo;m a type to gain awareness and move like I make the next step</p>
<p>I take the next fucking journey. Like I always that&rsquo;s how I fucking am</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m committed to growth no matter where it takes me once I see myself as more valuable and like my worth</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ignore my worth anymore. So I cannot mistreat myself. So</p>
<p>Everything about my fucking life is gonna have to change</p>
<p>Everything the friends I have the amount of time I spend with certain fucking people my family</p>
<p>the way I let people treat me the way I treat other people how I</p>
<p>Prioritize my time and who I let fucking waste it who I let have access to me</p>
<p>the requirements are gonna jump through the fucking roof to the goddamn moon like</p>
<p>Everything is just gonna fucking shift and have to change and that&rsquo;s a like it&rsquo;s a whole uproot of my entire life</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like damn like I know what&rsquo;s in store</p>
<p>I just need a fucking second to breathe before I like take that jump</p>
<p>I just want to thank you guys for coming along this journey with me of</p>
<p>Like the growth thing because I&rsquo;m gonna change a lot and the people that have been with me</p>
<p>Since like the first time I ever got on social media when I got on fucking YouTube</p>
<p>All my videos are deleted. They&rsquo;re all gone now</p>
<p>But the people that have seen me from that version of me when I was 18 19</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen how much I&rsquo;ve changed</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the fucking progression and the 45 different lifetimes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived between now and then you&rsquo;ve seen how committed I am to change and growth and I don&rsquo;t fucking say the same</p>
<p>Where you leave me is never where you fucking find me ever</p>
<p>But one more sick fucking twisted goddamn joke about this fucking dude as he lives in goddamn, Germany</p>
<p>Like just slap me right on the fucking dick. How annoying you know, but I did have another realization about</p>
<p>the whole like location thing and when you want something so I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at him living in Germany as a big fucking deal cuz bitch. I&rsquo;ll move there tomorrow. I love him</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to the motherfucker for like two days and I&rsquo;m over here like I love him</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to move with Germany, but that&rsquo;s how I fucking am</p>
<p>But in all seriousness</p>
<p>I just look at the whole like the location thing and the distance is not a problem</p>
<p>Like if I want it, I&rsquo;ll do it like I&rsquo;ll do what it takes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll move where I got to move and like do what it fucking takes to get what I want</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not even just about the boy</p>
<p>I had a realization about just something that you want when you want it bad enough when you value it enough</p>
<p>You will do what the fuck it takes</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve finally</p>
<p>Encountered something I&rsquo;ve wanted for so fucking long. It&rsquo;s something I never thought I&rsquo;d find that I&rsquo;m willing to</p>
<p>Make it motherfucking work if it&rsquo;s gonna even go that far like I&rsquo;m just forward thinking and like thinking in the future</p>
<p>But yo, I&rsquo;m not opposed to it. That&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>Most people would look at that and be like, oh, no, it&rsquo;s a deal-breaker like no, it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at it like that. If I want something I&rsquo;ll fucking get it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do what it takes to get it, but it&rsquo;s like with a relationship or anything else</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the same way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same level of like driven and ambitious when I want something like the amount of shit that I&rsquo;ve done in</p>
<p>24 years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a video on all like five of my career changes by 24 and you&rsquo;re gonna shit at the amount of things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done but</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for another podcast</p>
<p>Hi update. It&rsquo;s Leo from Cabo</p>
<p>I am gonna fill you in on what&rsquo;s happened since I&rsquo;ve recorded because I need to it&rsquo;s important information and I had another fucking realization</p>
<p>Me and guys stopped talking he said he was going to work on some fucking shit</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing to like help build his new apartment. Whatever. He&rsquo;s doing. He&rsquo;s doing like some next-level</p>
<p>Real rich shit. So he like gave me a heads up. He&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>On social media, so we&rsquo;re not gonna talk basically</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking that as him politely being like I don&rsquo;t want to talk anymore</p>
<p>Which is fine with me like I&rsquo;d rather have some acknowledgement than just fucking ghosting</p>
<p>But and it made me sad</p>
<p>So I went into that like when someone doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to you anymore like bitch that should be hurt</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shit</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are cuz like I&rsquo;m over here and I&rsquo;m aware about a lot of things and I&rsquo;m smart</p>
<p>But should still be hurting that should be hurting my feelings. It hurts everyone&rsquo;s feelings like we&rsquo;re all human</p>
<p>We all deal with the same emotions when someone doesn&rsquo;t like us back</p>
<p>Yeah, it fucking sucks. So I kind of went into what I was so sad about and the realization I pulled out of it</p>
<p>Was this motherfucker messaged me based off of what he saw online?</p>
<p>So what he could see online was enough to make him interested</p>
<p>He has not experienced even the first of me because you can&rsquo;t experience me</p>
<p>Fully through a fucking screen now if someone met me in person</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had someone meet me in person and not be interested in me</p>
<p>Okay, so the fact that you only saw me on social media you not wanting to talk to me anymore</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk or not. I&rsquo;m just like whatever. He doesn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s busy doing his shit</p>
<p>I take it as he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk cuz I don&rsquo;t give a fuck how busy you are if you want to talk</p>
<p>To somebody you will but if he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk anymore, or he lost interest. I&rsquo;m not mad about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not upset about it because that&rsquo;s a misjudgment. You didn&rsquo;t even fully get to experience me before you made your decision. So</p>
<p>You can go ahead and make that decision and I&rsquo;m not gonna beat myself up for it and let it bother me</p>
<p>Because I know that there&rsquo;s so much more to me than what you saw</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not taking it personal and I had to like dig into the way that I was feeling to get to that and like</p>
<p>Reassure myself of like Leo. He didn&rsquo;t get to see the full you</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t get to experience you because</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many aspects. You can&rsquo;t fucking capture through a screen and I talked about all that shit in the dating apps</p>
<p>Episode I did but there&rsquo;s just so many elements that he didn&rsquo;t even get to experience but just me on</p>
<p>Social media was enough to catch his interest. So that was reassuring and that was nice</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m fine like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>No, I really am NOT upset about it because I have this whole new awareness and I&rsquo;m focusing on me and all that shit</p>
<p>But motherfucker was in Berlin bitch, like what was I thinking, you know, like now I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Fuck like it wasn&rsquo;t even gonna go anywhere</p>
<p>I just got excited, you know, and then I got flooded with all these emotions and always fucking realizations</p>
<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m not letting it affect me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting it like make me hurt my feelings like bitch. You didn&rsquo;t even get to experience me fully</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not mad that you didn&rsquo;t want to keep talking, you know</p>
<p>Like you get fucking bored of people online like messaging is not fucking fun. I get bored too as shit</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not mad at it, but I&rsquo;m just letting you guys know like if you have a situation like that</p>
<p>Happened to you and someone loses interest or they stop talking ask yourself. Did they even get to experience me yet?</p>
<p>before you start getting mad at yourself and getting insecure and starting to like nitpick yourself and tear yourself apart of how you&rsquo;re not good</p>
<p>Enough and what you said wrong and what you could have done like don&rsquo;t stress yourself to fuck out over it</p>
<p>if the person didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to fully experience you because</p>
<p>Their decision is a misinformed decision. They only got half of what there was to decide on, you know</p>
<p>So yeah, that was my realization on that. So back to my regularly scheduled outro</p>
<p>if this podcast helped you will you send me a DM on Instagram and like</p>
<p>Just tell me cuz I really want to know</p>
<p>This podcast was just for me to open up and like help you guys relate or</p>
<p>Just help you guys get to know me better and let you in because I don&rsquo;t fucking let people in</p>
<p>But y&rsquo;all my friends we&rsquo;ve been through this bitch for 20 episodes like you fucking get me</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s time for me to let you in</p>
<p>But yeah, let me know what you think</p>
<p>And if you really like the podcast the whole bunch you could leave it five stars on Spotify or Apple podcasts</p>
<p>You could do it like a little five star just hit it. Like just bump the button. Just hit it</p>
<p>Please take care of yourselves. Be safe. Be nice to yourself and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
