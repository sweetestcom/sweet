<p>that karen would have something to say</p>
<p>to her and then carrie uh is from</p>
<p>wherever but i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll make sure i know</p>
<p>where that is</p>
<p>i lost my note anyway and here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>else is happening around the world so uh</p>
<p>we have viewers coming to us from the uk</p>
<p>canada uganda zambia jordan south africa</p>
<p>grenada sweden jakarta haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>from them before india france pakistan</p>
<p>mexico israel the netherlands norway</p>
<p>taiwan trinidad puerto rico greece</p>
<p>algeria good grief belgium germany iraq</p>
<p>switzerland maldives scotland iceland</p>
<p>japan italy hong kong egypt come on</p>
<p>chile brazil</p>
<p>morocco cameroon south korea</p>
<p>and australia new zealand the</p>
<p>motherland of ethiopia that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting thailand dubai</p>
<p>the philippines nicaragua peru vietnam</p>
<p>and all across these united states that</p>
<p>is by far the longest list we&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>had and we tip our hat to terry for</p>
<p>typing all that he probably just got a</p>
<p>world geography book out just hacking</p>
<p>down names no these are all genuine uh</p>
<p>people so let&rsquo;s see and why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>kick it off with a question from uh</p>
<p>social media let&rsquo;s see grace from</p>
<p>youtube will an apple a day mess up keto</p>
<p>enough to stop weight loss</p>
<p>well apple a day will definitely keep</p>
<p>you out of keto and</p>
<p>definitely won&rsquo;t keep the doctor away</p>
<p>unless you shoot it really really hard</p>
<p>at him which i don&rsquo;t recommend doing</p>
<p>that but um yeah the apples nowadays</p>
<p>are not the apples that were</p>
<p>we ate way in the way back you know when</p>
<p>apples were like more tart</p>
<p>a lot less sugar now we</p>
<p>bred them to have more carbohydrate more</p>
<p>sugar unfortunately so you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>you know 19 grams of sugar not even</p>
<p>carbohydrate sugar</p>
<p>so um in fact that was the one thing</p>
<p>that i um</p>
<p>i kept in thinking that was good i even</p>
<p>recommended in my first book like</p>
<p>uh apples and peanut butter and i ate</p>
<p>several to the day and i think it was a</p>
<p>hundred and</p>
<p>two no 211 pounds of course pure muscle</p>
<p>and then uh i went down to 185 when i</p>
<p>cut out the apples</p>
<p>and the snacking so yeah apples are will</p>
<p>not keep the doctor away um</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying stevia in uh apples and</p>
<p>bacon up you&rsquo;re still getting killed on</p>
<p>the sugar aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>yeah because it&rsquo;s the actual apple and</p>
<p>when you cook it</p>
<p>i bake it you make it turn into sugar</p>
<p>even more</p>
<p>so you have this because you break down</p>
<p>the carbohydrates just like a potato i</p>
<p>mean you can go ahead and eat a raw</p>
<p>potato all you want</p>
<p>but as soon as you cook it</p>
<p>it breaks down the starch and then it</p>
<p>increases the glycemic index what a chip</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see here um let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>mc from youtube why is that after a hard</p>
<p>leg workout i&rsquo;m craving cookies or</p>
<p>sweets</p>
<p>well because you&rsquo;re burning off your</p>
<p>glucose and you haven&rsquo;t adapted to fat</p>
<p>yet</p>
<p>so it takes a while one to three months</p>
<p>to get into fat adaptation where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually a</p>
<p>fat burner you&rsquo;re oxidizing fats and uh</p>
<p>you can work out and pull your fat</p>
<p>reserves</p>
<p>excuse me if you haven&rsquo;t adapted</p>
<p>and you work out you just deplete your</p>
<p>sugar because you&rsquo;re running on sugar</p>
<p>and then now you&rsquo;re going to be craving</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>all right well uh and by the way uh</p>
<p>social media see i came to you first</p>
<p>today we want to pay you due respect we</p>
<p>usually put you two or</p>
<p>number two or three out but not today</p>
<p>and so mickey from youtube here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>last one before we go to our first quiz</p>
<p>question does powdered milk have the</p>
<p>same amount of hormones as regular milk</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely um</p>
<p>positively and it&rsquo;s you know sometimes</p>
<p>people try to find the powdered milk for</p>
<p>a formula</p>
<p>you know if you if you do that um i</p>
<p>would go for goat&rsquo;s milk and try to get</p>
<p>it organic</p>
<p>because the cow&rsquo;s milk is</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s so many allergies there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many</p>
<p>issues with that hormonally um</p>
<p>even if it says no</p>
<p>uh rbst which is a another hormone thing</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do it i would go for the</p>
<p>goat&rsquo;s milk powder</p>
<p>very good okay we got some really fun</p>
<p>questions today and here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>all right what is the emotional</p>
<p>symptom or emotional symptom of high</p>
<p>high blood glucose high blood sugar so</p>
<p>like when your blood sugars go higher</p>
<p>what uh</p>
<p>emotional symptom</p>
<p>shows up</p>
<p>okay interesting now let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>uh carrie who&rsquo;s in the green room and</p>
<p>unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t get her camera</p>
<p>to work but her voice uh is wonderful so</p>
<p>carrie you&rsquo;re on with dr berg go ahead</p>
<p>with your question</p>
<p>hi there thank you steve yes first of</p>
<p>all steve i&rsquo;m from texas texas that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s from she told me that but</p>
<p>just keep my desk neat i tore up my</p>
<p>notes and threw them away sorry about</p>
<p>that so carrie from texas no no problem</p>
<p>at all hi doctor thank you so much for</p>
<p>letting me talk to you i am been very</p>
<p>frustrated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a master gardener and i specialize</p>
<p>in medicinal foods i have helped people</p>
<p>for many many years</p>
<p>with their own digestive issues and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always been healthy</p>
<p>overall i&rsquo;m 58 i&rsquo;m 5'4 i&rsquo;m 117 pounds so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a weight issue</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>my brother</p>
<p>turned me on to watching all of your</p>
<p>videos so i could try and diagnose</p>
<p>myself</p>
<p>he by the way has lost a hundred pounds</p>
<p>and i cannot believe his health</p>
<p>is incredible after following your</p>
<p>your plan of the really strict keto and</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so i started it five</p>
<p>weeks ago and</p>
<p>my symptoms were and have been over the</p>
<p>last seven years i&rsquo;ve been struggling</p>
<p>with this</p>
<p>continually getting worse</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>bloating fatigue after i eat</p>
<p>20 minutes exactly i sneeze so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking allergic reactions</p>
<p>um the nausea can be so bad i have to</p>
<p>sit down and relax after i eat dizziness</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking over here</p>
<p>after looking at your videos</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at adrenal cortisol related</p>
<p>and just last night this is this is very</p>
<p>timely</p>
<p>after eating again very strict i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fasting 20</p>
<p>to 22 yesterday i fasted 24 hours</p>
<p>i ate</p>
<p>my stomach was just churning</p>
<p>and then that area in the gallbladder</p>
<p>and liver started spasming</p>
<p>and it hasn&rsquo;t left me</p>
<p>all through the night</p>
<p>i remain bloated and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s discomfort it&rsquo;s not horrible</p>
<p>pain but there&rsquo;s definitely discomfort</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m eating as clean as you can eat about</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m taking the non-fortified nutritional</p>
<p>yeast i&rsquo;m afraid of the bile salts</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done that yet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then lastly</p>
<p>the only things i truly can eat without</p>
<p>any issues would be sardines salmon</p>
<p>kimchi and sauerkraut</p>
<p>okay so a couple questions</p>
<p>do you find that you um</p>
<p>bloat the more fiber that you eat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been trying to watch that and i</p>
<p>would have to say i could would bloat</p>
<p>more but i still bloat no matter what i</p>
<p>eat i ate a handful of arugula the other</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>not only did i sneeze but my i was</p>
<p>bloating as well</p>
<p>okay do you have you tried um betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>no i have not</p>
<p>um do you have any problems underneath</p>
<p>the right rib cage as far as a full</p>
<p>tight feeling that sometimes maybe goes</p>
<p>into the right shoulder or neck</p>
<p>no no shoulder pain no back pain um</p>
<p>full feeling would be you know the</p>
<p>bloating but you know like i said today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually discomfort</p>
<p>i i think when the first thing i would</p>
<p>try and this is a common thing where you</p>
<p>start to lose your</p>
<p>your your ph in your stomach and and</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t take a while to break down</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that can create bloating because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the foods that are not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>activated it&rsquo;s not breaking down fast</p>
<p>enough um and also the the p the stomach</p>
<p>ph activates the release of your own</p>
<p>bile salts so i wouldn&rsquo;t go in the</p>
<p>direction of bile salts quite yet i</p>
<p>would go betaine hydrochloride which</p>
<p>will acidify your stomach and you</p>
<p>probably need about five</p>
<p>before a meal and it does take some some</p>
<p>weeks to</p>
<p>really get it corrected but you take</p>
<p>that before you eat and then you find</p>
<p>that wow oh i have less bloating then we</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do that for a bit</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t quite get resolved i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>potentially</p>
<p>potentially it could be sibo which is</p>
<p>some bacteria in the small intestine</p>
<p>which is creating that but</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s a rare that&rsquo;s kind of a long</p>
<p>shot</p>
<p>but the other thing that might help is</p>
<p>to take some</p>
<p>bile salts or gallbladder formula and an</p>
<p>empty stomach</p>
<p>because that tends to keep the the bile</p>
<p>duct flowing freely but i would only do</p>
<p>that after you try one thing at a time</p>
<p>and the butane hydrochloride but the</p>
<p>bile salts will help</p>
<p>open up those but kind of just like</p>
<p>allows the the flow of</p>
<p>bile to go through the liver and the</p>
<p>gallbladder and so there won&rsquo;t be as</p>
<p>much bloating</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll get better digestion but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with the butane</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>okay and and doctor you said take five</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the mgs</p>
<p>um it really depends on i mean usually</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>i think the one i have is 300 milligrams</p>
<p>okay tablet and then it&rsquo;s the digestive</p>
<p>formula which i don&rsquo;t even know if i</p>
<p>were in stock with that but you could</p>
<p>find it some just betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>and just do like 300 milligrams and then</p>
<p>do five of those now</p>
<p>some people just um if they do two it</p>
<p>just does doesn&rsquo;t really create the</p>
<p>effect</p>
<p>so you want to build up the stomach acid</p>
<p>over maybe a period of some weeks and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re good for a while or</p>
<p>permanently so</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of things that can do</p>
<p>dilute our stomach acid and then you end</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>you know all of a sudden not digesting</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>your body can then not break things down</p>
<p>and you can have histamine reactions and</p>
<p>all sorts of issues so that could be why</p>
<p>you sneeze</p>
<p>is there a blood test</p>
<p>i want to go have the whole panel done</p>
<p>is there something specific that you</p>
<p>might have me do so i can see if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything else going on there</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>get</p>
<p>a stomach acid test it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>they have the invasive ones and the</p>
<p>non-invasive ones</p>
<p>the one that i like is you actually</p>
<p>swallow a pill on a string it goes down</p>
<p>your stomach you lay on your right side</p>
<p>you pull it back up and then it can you</p>
<p>can tell what&rsquo;s going on with the ph</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of a functional test than a</p>
<p>blood test</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you want to know what happens</p>
<p>you know in this in the different levels</p>
<p>of digestion but</p>
<p>doing a blood test is probably not going</p>
<p>to give you very much you need probably</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you probably do like a stool sample and</p>
<p>just look at undigested foods and that</p>
<p>would tell you if you have unadjusted</p>
<p>protein for example that can give you a</p>
<p>clue on</p>
<p>you have a problem with um lack of</p>
<p>stomach acids</p>
<p>okay great thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome and then out if you try</p>
<p>everything and then nothing works</p>
<p>then you can check for sibo and</p>
<p>go to a gastro duck and they can tell</p>
<p>you exactly what to do there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>gas</p>
<p>sibo small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth test in the small intestine</p>
<p>right yeah i would watch in your video</p>
<p>on that too and i thought maybe that</p>
<p>might be a possibility so we&rsquo;ll keep</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll keep plugging away at it and see</p>
<p>if we can get it fixed thank you again</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s heartbreaking when someone</p>
<p>like carrie is willing to do everything</p>
<p>to be so disciplined and still has</p>
<p>trouble for me me for instance six</p>
<p>crispy creams no bloating it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>fair</p>
<p>so we wish you know people people uh</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bloat as much with refined foods</p>
<p>you know they can get away with the</p>
<p>donuts but they they bloat with</p>
<p>you know some of these</p>
<p>more fiber and</p>
<p>you know whole foods</p>
<p>yeah so yeah well we wish you well i</p>
<p>wish i had her discipline okay uh the</p>
<p>audience is very disciplined because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already answered the question</p>
<p>which asks what is the emotional symptom</p>
<p>of high blood sugar and i think</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s right to some degree</p>
<p>87 percent said anxiety or irritability</p>
<p>10 said fatigue or sleepiness and 3</p>
<p>percent say anger</p>
<p>anger is correct</p>
<p>anger sometimes depression but anger is</p>
<p>the symptom that you would get with high</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s really interesting so 97 of</p>
<p>the audience failed the test 3</p>
<p>congratulations it&rsquo;s that anger but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to give them another shot</p>
<p>later on in the show and let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>steve remember that guy who um we</p>
<p>interviewed</p>
<p>uh oh i interviewed him</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a guy who um had serious</p>
<p>issues this is life</p>
<p>not doing too well completely stuck in</p>
<p>anger and he decided to take his life so</p>
<p>he went</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from australia he went in his room</p>
<p>and he was going to starve himself to</p>
<p>death</p>
<p>so he lays in his bed</p>
<p>after the third day of fasting</p>
<p>he started feeling better and happier</p>
<p>and wow why do i feel so good i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i want to do that anymore and it</p>
<p>changed his life and he started looking</p>
<p>at fasting and</p>
<p>that was fascinating so he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lost a lot of weight but</p>
<p>it kind of his plan rebounded on on his</p>
<p>strategy</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m delighted that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>happened to him that&rsquo;s a great story and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true boy you are what you eat in</p>
<p>terms of your emotions too at least in</p>
<p>my case shayna from facebook how can you</p>
<p>tell</p>
<p>off to ask question how can you tell</p>
<p>when you tap into fat burning mode i</p>
<p>just i don&rsquo;t know i assume she&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>for keto</p>
<p>well one of the best ways to tap into to</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>is your appetite does your appetite go</p>
<p>away especially between meals can you go</p>
<p>along for your time without eating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best indicator more than</p>
<p>weight anything and it just tells me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning fat between meals</p>
<p>now if you could only go for so many</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>then you need to eat we know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>burning fat</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just running on your sugar up and</p>
<p>down up and down so that&rsquo;s uh i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best indicator um to really</p>
<p>know even if you&rsquo;re in ketosis and fat</p>
<p>burning because that&rsquo;s really the first</p>
<p>goal of doing this program</p>
<p>wonderful over to youtube lisha says her</p>
<p>kidney numbers are dropping dramatically</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know numbers those are maybe you</p>
<p>do what can i do to restore them back to</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>kidney numbers</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what she said didn&rsquo;t go any</p>
<p>further</p>
<p>well i</p>
<p>kind of need to know what</p>
<p>is it uh the filtration rate what what</p>
<p>values uh i is it protein</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i would need to know more specifics on</p>
<p>that but um</p>
<p>yeah i have no idea</p>
<p>yeah exactly why don&rsquo;t you um</p>
<p>uh you know write us a little bit more</p>
<p>thorough and we&rsquo;ll kind of look for your</p>
<p>questions see if we can&rsquo;t have you fill</p>
<p>us in a little bit more so the doctor</p>
<p>can answer your question</p>
<p>and why don&rsquo;t we go with the second quiz</p>
<p>question for today and here it is doc</p>
<p>all right so um what would be the</p>
<p>emotional symptom of low blood sugar</p>
<p>okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna ask this</p>
<p>question what do you guys think</p>
<p>type in your answers okay dig into it uh</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go to someone</p>
<p>whose camera is working and that would</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>janus</p>
<p>from pennsylvania and let me unmute you</p>
<p>on this side janice and let me look for</p>
<p>your wonderful visage here and janice i</p>
<p>hope you can hear us you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>with dr berg</p>
<p>hello i&rsquo;m so excited to meet you</p>
<p>hello thank you for the wonderful</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my question i need to heal a</p>
<p>fatty liver</p>
<p>after um 15 years of prednisone use for</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve already messed up my metabolism but</p>
<p>i need this to work so here&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>as a vegetarian</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>eats fish and dairy but no meat and i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t since i was 16 and i&rsquo;m 66 years</p>
<p>old now</p>
<p>excuse me</p>
<p>and as someone with elevated cholesterol</p>
<p>is keto even possible while i eat only</p>
<p>fish and is it safe for me</p>
<p>given my cholesterol level for anyone</p>
<p>with a higher cholesterol level</p>
<p>well absolutely because um here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>data that you may not know</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>many times especially the the kind that</p>
<p>can invade your arteries</p>
<p>is converted from carbs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s converted from carbs so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>the fatty fish which i&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing because now we can get our</p>
<p>protein and our omega-3 fatty acids um</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re going to be fine you</p>
<p>then then</p>
<p>do the rest vegetables not the grains</p>
<p>not the sugar because the liver the</p>
<p>fatty</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>can be coming from</p>
<p>non-fat sources it could be coming from</p>
<p>vegan</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>probably more likely and uh so</p>
<p>they found that if you do a low carb</p>
<p>diet the fat on your liver</p>
<p>potentially can</p>
<p>reduce to 50 percent in two weeks</p>
<p>um and so that&rsquo;s exciting news i would</p>
<p>combine the healthy keto with the fish</p>
<p>and uh do uh intermittent fasting</p>
<p>together that&rsquo;ll be your best bet i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>probably add into the mix</p>
<p>milk thistle because that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>best uh remedies for supporting liver</p>
<p>and improving liver enzymes</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the cruciferous vegetables are great for</p>
<p>the liver so i think i think you can</p>
<p>turn this around pretty a to b but</p>
<p>it is safe for the liver a high carb</p>
<p>diet is not safe for the liver</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>and then watch my videos on on the liver</p>
<p>i i think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve watched quite a few of them they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really helpful very helpful so i&rsquo;m now</p>
<p>drinking lemon juice</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>in water with apple cider vinegar but</p>
<p>also adding um pulverized ginger to that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s well i like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great that off and on all day</p>
<p>yeah all alcohol or wine stopped</p>
<p>good good yeah it&rsquo;s uh we want to</p>
<p>reverse the the fatty liver so yeah we</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>cut that out</p>
<p>so two weeks you said</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s just the start you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see significant changes right</p>
<p>when you start doing this once you start</p>
<p>dropping the carb um but see here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing the fat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that the dietary fat you can consume</p>
<p>more of that if your carbs are low i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking about vegetable carbs other</p>
<p>carbs so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of false information about</p>
<p>cholesterol but</p>
<p>in the studies they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to do a nutritional study on</p>
<p>cholesterol because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>other variables</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard to isolate in fact on any</p>
<p>nutritional</p>
<p>element because it&rsquo;s like how do you</p>
<p>know that was the thing you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s really hard but um</p>
<p>anyway i think that&rsquo;s what i would do if</p>
<p>i were you thank you may i ask you a</p>
<p>question quickly about dairy</p>
<p>um so i</p>
<p>read some of dr campbell&rsquo;s china study</p>
<p>about dairy he kind of says that dairy</p>
<p>can switch on cancer genes so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like to rely on it too much i do eat a</p>
<p>lot for</p>
<p>yogurt</p>
<p>what do you think about dairy well um</p>
<p>the studies that he did</p>
<p>were on mice and</p>
<p>also he&rsquo;s done some other studies as</p>
<p>well but</p>
<p>i think casein</p>
<p>is not the best protein in the world</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>from cows that you don&rsquo;t even know if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had hormones or not or</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re dealing with a</p>
<p>a protein that is a growth hormone i</p>
<p>mean think about whey protein too which</p>
<p>is another protein and dairy that</p>
<p>bodybuilders consume</p>
<p>so it has growth potential properties</p>
<p>for cancer</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re doing a moderate amount of</p>
<p>high quality cheese let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>switzerland cheese that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know from cows that are really</p>
<p>healthy on top of a mountain top</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing that in a moderate way</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a problem but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>other cheese that&rsquo;s just commercial</p>
<p>cheese there&rsquo;s a lot of bad things in</p>
<p>cheese i&rsquo;ll tell you right now thank you</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>good luck janice uh we would love to</p>
<p>hear back from you and see if you can uh</p>
<p>square all that cholesterol deal away</p>
<p>and uh her she talked about grinding up</p>
<p>ginger it&rsquo;s a perfect segue to our</p>
<p>question from colleen on facebook wants</p>
<p>to know what are your thoughts of drying</p>
<p>and grinding eggshells to add a smoothie</p>
<p>for extra</p>
<p>calcium doesn&rsquo;t that make any sense</p>
<p>yeah i think um</p>
<p>the type of calcium in eggshells uh is</p>
<p>is not the best for</p>
<p>our bodies it&rsquo;s really good for the</p>
<p>plant that can absorb these elemental</p>
<p>types of calcium that go into the plant</p>
<p>that converts it the plant uses with the</p>
<p>help of bacteria uses um</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>minerals and metals and things like that</p>
<p>and so it starts to convert it but</p>
<p>our bodies</p>
<p>do better with</p>
<p>types of minerals that are</p>
<p>connected to a protein either</p>
<p>plant-based or even an animal so um i</p>
<p>would get your calcium probably from</p>
<p>some dairy or vegetables i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>grind the eggshells up</p>
<p>you might absorb some but it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>best</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>if you take the number one selling</p>
<p>vitamin and i won&rsquo;t mention that name</p>
<p>they use calcium carbonate as the first</p>
<p>ingredient and the whole bottle is</p>
<p>really heavy so it&rsquo;s great as a paper</p>
<p>weight but i would not ingest it because</p>
<p>calcium carbonate it&rsquo;s like chewing on</p>
<p>the cement right outside your house</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not the best source oh goodness</p>
<p>okay well let&rsquo;s see uh audience is still</p>
<p>on it and the second question was what</p>
<p>uh is the emotional symptom let me put</p>
<p>it up there</p>
<p>for low blood sugar and the audience 85</p>
<p>say grouchiness or irritability 10 say</p>
<p>depression or fear and 5 say confusion</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>high blood sugar anger</p>
<p>low blood sugar</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>anxiety</p>
<p>worry</p>
<p>uh nervous</p>
<p>okay so that would be the</p>
<p>i mean you could there&rsquo;s shades of in</p>
<p>between but</p>
<p>when your blood sugar is low</p>
<p>you get anxiety and you get nervous you</p>
<p>get worried and that&rsquo;s why a little bit</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>nutritional yeast or b1 just completely</p>
<p>clears it up because that really can</p>
<p>help you with your blood sugars</p>
<p>potassium can help too by the way but</p>
<p>b1 is the is the one um that you and</p>
<p>then when you get on a healthy keto plan</p>
<p>boy does your mood change for the better</p>
<p>um it just kind of brings you up makes</p>
<p>you more stable um</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re more yourself so a lot of</p>
<p>people that are kind of in these</p>
<p>emotional</p>
<p>bands</p>
<p>really just have blood sugar issues up</p>
<p>and down up and down</p>
<p>go from anxiety to grouchiness you know</p>
<p>anger up and down i don&rsquo;t know steve if</p>
<p>you know anyone like that but</p>
<p>there are people out there like that i</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s hard to believe well dr berg</p>
<p>has forced me into those experiments uh</p>
<p>he says i want you to eat a cup of sugar</p>
<p>and call me in the morning i just feel</p>
<p>awful at that point no but i i have</p>
<p>slipped before but i really do i joke</p>
<p>about it but i&rsquo;ll tell you what dr berg</p>
<p>has fixed my what goes on between my</p>
<p>ears i&rsquo;m not so worried about weight</p>
<p>though i&rsquo;ve lost quite a bit but i just</p>
<p>feel so much better intermittent</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is my main thing</p>
<p>and i just calm down and settle down and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel so grumpy so there really is</p>
<p>something uh to that um obviously uh and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something that affects you we</p>
<p>appreciate that steve oh absolutely so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>carolyn we appreciate her because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching from facebook and she and this</p>
<p>is probably a question for a lot of</p>
<p>ladies because of pcos it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>impossible to lose my belly and</p>
<p>lose skin from my c-section is it</p>
<p>possible to lose them without surgery</p>
<p>if you fix the cause which is um the</p>
<p>androgens are too high and the antigens</p>
<p>um are coming because um the ovary is</p>
<p>pumping out too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s converting more male hormone and</p>
<p>that comes from insulin so if she were</p>
<p>to um fix the insulin problem she can</p>
<p>fix the androgen problem and her weight</p>
<p>problem so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what she needs to do is reduce</p>
<p>insulin and that is the keto keto plan</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about so</p>
<p>i would definitely consider it</p>
<p>wonderful okay debbie also on facebook</p>
<p>wants to know which protein would you</p>
<p>recommend for smoothies other than whey</p>
<p>protein which you spoke of earlier</p>
<p>you can do pea protein</p>
<p>you can do pea protein that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good one um</p>
<p>collagen protein</p>
<p>um egg protein would be the best the</p>
<p>whole egg protein</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yeah that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific i tell you why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we launch uh the next question</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see i think i did that now</p>
<p>one two three four</p>
<p>sorry folks</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s start with this one a true</p>
<p>falseer</p>
<p>all right true or false if i can read</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>atherosclerosis is a vascular disease</p>
<p>okay yes or no audience</p>
<p>spin the wheel</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be a lot easier to get this</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m sure with a 50 50 chance</p>
<p>uh sue manth from</p>
<p>if i said that right from youtube</p>
<p>will doing squats improve my growth</p>
<p>hormone</p>
<p>well if you&rsquo;re doing any exercise with</p>
<p>intensity especially the large muscle</p>
<p>groups um you are going to spike</p>
<p>growth hormone up to</p>
<p>like 600 percent so yes yes that will</p>
<p>help you</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s like you know don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>over train and you get enough sleep so</p>
<p>these short bursts of high intensity</p>
<p>using as many muscles as you can um</p>
<p>would be awesome in fact one of the</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different scales of types of</p>
<p>exercises right and there&rsquo;s several ways</p>
<p>to get there but i mean if you were to</p>
<p>do like a full flat out sprint which is</p>
<p>hard if your knees are bothering you</p>
<p>that would give you a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of spike</p>
<p>and then you also have</p>
<p>plowmetrics hopping on different things</p>
<p>uh and then</p>
<p>i was in the russian um no it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the hungarian bag swing i was doing that</p>
<p>for a while i like to rotate it now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really into the sled</p>
<p>the sled there&rsquo;s a guy um</p>
<p>if you saw him on youtube it&rsquo;s called um</p>
<p>toes over knees guys incredible</p>
<p>incredible exercises for your knees and</p>
<p>legs and hips and uh he recommends the</p>
<p>sled so of course i bought one what a</p>
<p>workout you go backwards you pull the</p>
<p>sled you push the sled</p>
<p>the best workout and what&rsquo;s cool is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like weight bearing on your</p>
<p>knees</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of going</p>
<p>lateral and so it&rsquo;s good for your back</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>love it and you can get one heck of a</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>you work your feet as well</p>
<p>they have a lot of different sleds you</p>
<p>can buy they&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re dragging</p>
<p>this thing you&rsquo;re putting a weight on it</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>do it on your grass you can do it in</p>
<p>your basement it&rsquo;s pretty cool</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s wonderful let&rsquo;s see why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to our next guest in the</p>
<p>lineup and that would be carolyn</p>
<p>and carolyn uh is from the frigid</p>
<p>colorado springs</p>
<p>and hold on carolyn i want to unmute you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on with dr burke</p>
<p>thank you steve hey dr berg hi um so my</p>
<p>question might be two-fold seven weeks</p>
<p>ago i had my gallbladder removed</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m actually underweight because i</p>
<p>got so sick before it got removed and it</p>
<p>was actually sudden it wasn&rsquo;t stones it</p>
<p>was non-functioning after a virus</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have the typical</p>
<p>attacks that you would get so doctors</p>
<p>thought it was in my head for so long</p>
<p>until they finally did all the</p>
<p>functioning tests and unfortunately it</p>
<p>had to come out i didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>save it</p>
<p>and i was so miserable so i am</p>
<p>underweight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still having trouble i&rsquo;m seven weeks</p>
<p>out i&rsquo;m having trouble still with</p>
<p>healthy fats regular fats getting back</p>
<p>to a normal diet</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t have this might be too much</p>
<p>information i don&rsquo;t have diarrhea so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s never been a side</p>
<p>effect of mine it&rsquo;s been more</p>
<p>constipation before the gallbladder</p>
<p>removal now i&rsquo;m pretty regular since it</p>
<p>came out but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to gain weight</p>
<p>trying to do it right</p>
<p>i have high cholesterol so you never</p>
<p>know that by looking at me apparently i</p>
<p>have very bad genes</p>
<p>cholesterol numbers hover between 220</p>
<p>and 240</p>
<p>and so i&rsquo;m trying to find a way i need</p>
<p>to get healthy again and i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>find if keto can work for me</p>
<p>without a gallbladder and how i can get</p>
<p>those fats</p>
<p>back in my system because right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still eating low-fat non-fat</p>
<p>and i need to gain another 10 to 15</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>well the good news is that</p>
<p>you have the perfect symptoms for</p>
<p>some bile salts i would do like a</p>
<p>gallbladder formula</p>
<p>bile salt</p>
<p>as well as an additional biocell called</p>
<p>the tudk it&rsquo;s called tut cup</p>
<p>and i would do the two i also have gerd</p>
<p>grade level two</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so tutka is a bile salt that you take on</p>
<p>an empty stomach take two</p>
<p>and then the other one to just take with</p>
<p>the meals because</p>
<p>the fact that you had constipation in</p>
<p>the past tells me that you were</p>
<p>deficient in bile</p>
<p>and just kind of made made that area of</p>
<p>your body weak the virus kind of went in</p>
<p>there and did the rest but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to um</p>
<p>trying to gain weight right now and</p>
<p>part of your digestive digestive system</p>
<p>is uh missing</p>
<p>so you need some help um</p>
<p>the gallbladder normally concentrates</p>
<p>the bile so then you when you eat it can</p>
<p>release the bile to extract the fats</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s probably not happening</p>
<p>to the degree that you needed to so now</p>
<p>you just have to</p>
<p>give your body some bile</p>
<p>to help</p>
<p>make things work a little bit better and</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>even though the liver is producing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be concentrated enough</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you take it with food now you can</p>
<p>actually absorb the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>now you can absorb the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the one thing that helps you mobilize</p>
<p>cholesterol so it doesn&rsquo;t back up and</p>
<p>build up in the blood is bile</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what you need that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been missing and so these are all</p>
<p>just some kind of like</p>
<p>epigenetic effects</p>
<p>to help someone with the genetic issue</p>
<p>that you have</p>
<p>so i think um i think that would help</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>you probably need a little bit of help</p>
<p>with uh</p>
<p>with your gerd so i would take some</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride which is a</p>
<p>supplement you could just take right</p>
<p>before you eat and then take the bile</p>
<p>salt after you eat and just play around</p>
<p>with the dosage because then when you</p>
<p>start eating</p>
<p>we keep that</p>
<p>valve nice and close so it doesn&rsquo;t back</p>
<p>up and then you can actually digest more</p>
<p>food which would be a really great thing</p>
<p>so um the combination of</p>
<p>the potato chloride to help your acid</p>
<p>and then also the bile salts are</p>
<p>what you need</p>
<p>and the bile salts without in your</p>
<p>gallbladder formula would that be</p>
<p>sufficient or would would there be would</p>
<p>you recommend different i would use that</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>the bile salts</p>
<p>right after the meal</p>
<p>and then i would add i would</p>
<p>buy some additional tatka i don&rsquo;t sell</p>
<p>that you just have to look that up find</p>
<p>that tudka which is a</p>
<p>a different type of bile salt on an</p>
<p>empty stomach and what that&rsquo;s just going</p>
<p>to do it&rsquo;s going to keep</p>
<p>keep the bile ducts really flowing</p>
<p>nicely so your liver is happy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>your system is working better and um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many miraculous things that</p>
<p>happen with tutka and especially even</p>
<p>with your cholesterol levels</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;ll like that</p>
<p>okay thank you now i&rsquo;m on a ppi for my</p>
<p>gerd</p>
<p>i tried to lean off a couple weeks ago</p>
<p>post surgery and take apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar tried to do that and it made</p>
<p>everything inflamed and burning so i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if i did it wrong i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to lean</p>
<p>so the the problem is you&rsquo;re stuck in a</p>
<p>rock and a hard place because you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel better temporarily</p>
<p>until you eat again so you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to figure out how you&rsquo;re gonna um</p>
<p>slowly transition because we have to</p>
<p>acidify you to keep that bowel close</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you probably have gastritis you probably</p>
<p>have inflammation now from</p>
<p>from all this so you you it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a juggle</p>
<p>um and you might need a little um</p>
<p>chlorophyll and</p>
<p>zinc l-carnosine for just to heal the</p>
<p>inflammation up in the stomach probably</p>
<p>a probiotic i think you&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>juggle things and work on the different</p>
<p>parts of your digestion until you can</p>
<p>eventually</p>
<p>come off that because long term</p>
<p>you start removing that well guess what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to do it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to even</p>
<p>produce bile because that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>that triggers it is acid so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it</p>
<p>so then then the valve can&rsquo;t close and</p>
<p>then you might feel like you have too</p>
<p>much acid which in fact you have not</p>
<p>enough acid</p>
<p>but anyway there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bit more to study up on that</p>
<p>topic but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a juggle you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to play around with these things</p>
<p>and do kind of a gradual type thing</p>
<p>i would find an alternative doctor that</p>
<p>an md that you can work with that</p>
<p>can help you with this transition</p>
<p>because some of the doctors are like no</p>
<p>you have to be on this um ppi for the</p>
<p>rest of your life and there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>else we can do like oh</p>
<p>okay thanks</p>
<p>great thank you you&rsquo;re welcome and thank</p>
<p>you carolyn for a great question and we</p>
<p>asked the audience a question or this</p>
<p>one was a true false and it asked art uh</p>
<p>say that for me doc i got arthritis</p>
<p>atherosclerosis thank you it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vascular disease and uh i bet the</p>
<p>audience could uh could pronounce that</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s their answer uh 50 percent</p>
<p>say respondents say true 50 say false</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>do you know why</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>atherosclerosis in your veins and 50 of</p>
<p>your um vascular system is in the veins</p>
<p>capillaries you never see</p>
<p>atherosclerotic plaquing in your veins</p>
<p>or capillaries</p>
<p>or the small blood vessels it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mainly in the arteries so it&rsquo;s really an</p>
<p>artery disease not a vascular disease</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m going to be doing a video on</p>
<p>on why it occurs</p>
<p>in the vascular system and not the other</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be interesting so</p>
<p>especially since you know you know heart</p>
<p>disease is the number one death in the</p>
<p>world</p>
<p>so it might be a good idea just to know</p>
<p>a little bit more about it</p>
<p>absolutely ben</p>
<p>ben wu from youtube would like to know</p>
<p>uh if you eat sufficient amounts of</p>
<p>leafy greens do you still need</p>
<p>supplements of omega-3s</p>
<p>especially yeah because you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>very much omega-3 and leafy green</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>it comes in fish fatty fish</p>
<p>you can also get an algae you know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but no you&rsquo;re not going to get a lot of</p>
<p>it in you know you get like a pre</p>
<p>a pre</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acid and some</p>
<p>in some greens</p>
<p>but it has to be converted</p>
<p>and so unless you&rsquo;re doing cod liver oil</p>
<p>or fatty fish or sardines</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re not going to get enough</p>
<p>omega-3 and that&rsquo;s really a big</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s missing in a lot of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s diet</p>
<p>wow well catherine from youtube wants to</p>
<p>know what your thoughts are on</p>
<p>bioidentical hormones in this case</p>
<p>estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>i would try other means first before you</p>
<p>go that route because as soon as you</p>
<p>start taking hormones</p>
<p>your own gland that makes those hormones</p>
<p>now don&rsquo;t that doesn&rsquo;t have to produce</p>
<p>the sufficient amounts so now we&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of creating this complexity where now</p>
<p>your glands kind of shut down now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dependent on it and then how do</p>
<p>you know how much to give the person and</p>
<p>over time things fluctuate i would i</p>
<p>would try to do other things find out</p>
<p>why the gland is not producing the</p>
<p>hormones in the first place</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that would be a good question answer and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>phytoestrogens that you can take which</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give you more estrogen they</p>
<p>help balance your ratios out</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s other things you can do</p>
<p>sorry doc i reach for my iced tea</p>
<p>uh and now i&rsquo;ve got it in my grasp and</p>
<p>flower love</p>
<p>she claims is her name from facebook</p>
<p>will monk fruit sweetener</p>
<p>in my coffee break of fast what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best sweetener that you recommend</p>
<p>no monk fruit won&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>i personally you know it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>it has an aftertaste so i won&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>but you can do it not a problem um</p>
<p>you can do the stevia you you can do</p>
<p>erythritol which won&rsquo;t break fast now</p>
<p>xylitol is a little bit higher on the</p>
<p>glycemic index but it tastes just like</p>
<p>sugar that&rsquo;s what i use in my coffee but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have much i&rsquo;ll just have one</p>
<p>packet in my small little cup of coffee</p>
<p>i should show people how big it is i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>tiny</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what i would i would put</p>
<p>all right great deal melinda from</p>
<p>facebook i&rsquo;ve just found out i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>allergic to yeast through blood testing</p>
<p>i have to stop taking your</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and just take b1</p>
<p>supplements is there anything else</p>
<p>is that the same kind of yeast stock</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s rare but you can have a use to</p>
<p>any protein and there&rsquo;s protein in yeast</p>
<p>so there could be some something there</p>
<p>or some sensitivity</p>
<p>so i would just find another</p>
<p>natural source of b1 which there are out</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s not easy to find</p>
<p>but keep looking um</p>
<p>because you need those b vitamins um see</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um if you look at natural bees</p>
<p>um they normally always use</p>
<p>yeast to get their bees and if you look</p>
<p>at the back label sometimes like this</p>
<p>some companies will have these massive</p>
<p>levels of b vitamins from yeast</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because they fortify them</p>
<p>with synthetic vitamins so um</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know that but that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they do</p>
<p>interesting well i love this guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to read his question just</p>
<p>uncle deathy so uncle death with a y so</p>
<p>we can say something about his um his</p>
<p>mood from youtube how can i calm down an</p>
<p>outbreak of crohn&rsquo;s disease that&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s irritating your colon and so we</p>
<p>want to you may you might probably</p>
<p>benefit from a carnivore</p>
<p>diet at least temporarily because the</p>
<p>the vegetables um fiber tend to</p>
<p>irritate it not to mention other things</p>
<p>too probably if you&rsquo;re doing any wheat</p>
<p>you should stop that</p>
<p>of course</p>
<p>glute i don&rsquo;t even need to mention</p>
<p>gluten because you probably already know</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>but um yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of things that</p>
<p>can irritate the colon and</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you probably want to go on a carnivore</p>
<p>for a while</p>
<p>okay wonderful and here&rsquo;s our next</p>
<p>question doc</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s see is it possible</p>
<p>to feel no symptoms when you have high</p>
<p>blood pressure</p>
<p>boy is that a good question audience dig</p>
<p>into that because i&rsquo;ve had slightly</p>
<p>elevated blood pressure and i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>felt anything but i don&rsquo;t have super</p>
<p>high so anyway let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>to uh our final guest in the green room</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s christina and she&rsquo;s from my</p>
<p>old haunt uh irvine california and</p>
<p>christine you are on if you&rsquo;ve unmuted</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re on with dr burke</p>
<p>all right hi dr berg thank you so much</p>
<p>for taking my call hello hi</p>
<p>um i just wanted to first thank you so</p>
<p>much i found your videos earlier this</p>
<p>year and you&rsquo;ve made such a difference</p>
<p>and i appreciate you</p>
<p>just empowering your viewers with</p>
<p>knowledge um</p>
<p>i felt like i knew kind of the basics</p>
<p>but your videos really helped me</p>
<p>understand my body and my health and</p>
<p>really take more control of it so thank</p>
<p>you for that</p>
<p>um and i just gave you a little</p>
<p>background i stumbled upon your videos</p>
<p>because i was um experiencing frequent</p>
<p>headaches um pretty much on a weekly</p>
<p>basis i tried to roll out</p>
<p>as many things as possible and just</p>
<p>nothing would work and i was in the</p>
<p>cycle of taking</p>
<p>tylenol</p>
<p>to help with the pain from my headache</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m allergic to aspirin and</p>
<p>ibuprofen so i&rsquo;ve been taking way too</p>
<p>much tylenol within my lifetime and</p>
<p>stuck on a cycle and it wasn&rsquo;t until</p>
<p>your videos that i realized how</p>
<p>connected headaches are to the liver</p>
<p>and that i was likely just feeding just</p>
<p>damaging my liver by taking so much</p>
<p>tylenol and then</p>
<p>you know it leading to more headaches so</p>
<p>um anyways i&rsquo;ve focused with your plan</p>
<p>um healthy keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and really focusing on repairing my</p>
<p>liver lots of lemon water um i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had any headaches so thank you</p>
<p>so much um it&rsquo;s been three months</p>
<p>no tylenol</p>
<p>um but to me</p>
<p>um so i&rsquo;ve been following your plan and</p>
<p>everything has been going well i do omad</p>
<p>or two meals a day spaced out like about</p>
<p>four hours</p>
<p>um so i&rsquo;ll have like at least a good 20</p>
<p>hours of fasting</p>
<p>but i still find that this the sweet</p>
<p>tooth snack attack hits</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um i do if i do give in i do like um</p>
<p>a dark chocolate i&rsquo;ll do berries like a</p>
<p>six ounce carton of berries</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;ll make like a</p>
<p>quick little smoothie with uh like</p>
<p>strawberries a little bit of pea protein</p>
<p>water just to like give a little bit of</p>
<p>that sweetness and i know from your</p>
<p>videos you&rsquo;re going to say well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not really in ketosis</p>
<p>christina but</p>
<p>i did have lab work done and they</p>
<p>confirmed that i had ketones in my urine</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a habit if i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just gone my whole life i was previously</p>
<p>like a huge</p>
<p>like carboholic chocoholic so maybe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just out of habit like need a little bit</p>
<p>of sweet</p>
<p>but i just want to get your take like</p>
<p>how often can i do this is it going to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>knock me out of ketosis or slow down my</p>
<p>progress um and kind of what your</p>
<p>thoughts are on my</p>
<p>healthy dessert options</p>
<p>so so do you have them as a dessert or</p>
<p>do you have them between the meals</p>
<p>i have them at the very end so if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s my omad it&rsquo;s just at the end if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my two meals it&rsquo;ll be at the end of</p>
<p>my dinner</p>
<p>wow well so um and then the</p>
<p>the chocolate is it um keto friendly or</p>
<p>just regular chocolate</p>
<p>keto friendly because i realize dark</p>
<p>chocolate often has sugar in it so i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do like a lily&rsquo;s chocolate they&rsquo;ll do um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not i think they use us dv sweetened</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so i know there are some carbs in it but</p>
<p>no added sugar</p>
<p>you know i think i think that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably within the normal guidelines of</p>
<p>keto i think that&rsquo;s why your ketones are</p>
<p>showing up because</p>
<p>your carbs probably are not higher</p>
<p>despite berries or the uh</p>
<p>the sweetened chocolate so you might be</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>the the the good the thing that i would</p>
<p>do if i would get a little glucose test</p>
<p>to just look at where your glucose is</p>
<p>because if you have a history of liver</p>
<p>damage which probably you do and bad</p>
<p>insulin resistance you might your liver</p>
<p>might be making making sugar</p>
<p>behind your back creating these little</p>
<p>cravings and so in that case</p>
<p>if you checked your blood sugar</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called a dawn</p>
<p>phenomena which you wake up with blood</p>
<p>sugar that&rsquo;s a little bit higher that</p>
<p>would be interesting that would be</p>
<p>really interesting if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>close to 100 or more than 100 then you</p>
<p>know okay</p>
<p>i need to work on my liver a little bit</p>
<p>more and then you take sting no milk</p>
<p>thistle that&rsquo;s a really good one</p>
<p>and i think i&rsquo;ve talked about this as</p>
<p>well nac is a good one</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then periodic prolonged fasting so</p>
<p>maybe once every two weeks you do you go</p>
<p>two days without eating i mean that</p>
<p>would really help your liver if you</p>
<p>could do it</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take some time i think</p>
<p>um to fully get to the point where</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>your liver is back to normal it takes</p>
<p>like three years actually so just just</p>
<p>realize that and just keep working on it</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>i if you check your blood sugars if you</p>
<p>are like 80 like right around 80 or less</p>
<p>you know check it periodically</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>you might be okay by doing these berries</p>
<p>and the chocolate and uh</p>
<p>um i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably within the guidelines so</p>
<p>i i thought you were gonna consume these</p>
<p>between the mail but you&rsquo;re not so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing great</p>
<p>thank you dr berg i appreciate your time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome well thanks and christina</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t even brag about the beautiful</p>
<p>weather that greets you every day there</p>
<p>in southern california i do meet that so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really cool and thanks for</p>
<p>joining us on the dr burke show and</p>
<p>please do like we ask everyone that</p>
<p>joins in the green room to let us know</p>
<p>after some period of time how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing because dr burke really cares</p>
<p>and uh steve</p>
<p>steve i used to live in san diego now i</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know i live in uh virginia and i</p>
<p>tell you</p>
<p>that winter every year you got to go</p>
<p>through that winter it&rsquo;s like oh here we</p>
<p>go another just kind of go through this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in fact it&rsquo;s going to snow snow</p>
<p>tonight steve can you believe that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m done with this this</p>
<p>weather i&rsquo;m ready for</p>
<p>spring and summer how about you i sure</p>
<p>am and i lived well as i said in orange</p>
<p>county and i would always fly back east</p>
<p>because all my relatives were in the</p>
<p>east for christmas and of course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of nice because sometimes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>snow in this sprinkle you know the</p>
<p>sparkling lights but when i would fly</p>
<p>back into john wayne orange county</p>
<p>airport get out and the palm fronds were</p>
<p>sort of clacking together in the santa</p>
<p>ana winds i said this is home this is</p>
<p>the place to be</p>
<p>you can keep your lousy snow and your</p>
<p>chains and your salt and all that junk</p>
<p>so it really is hard to beat</p>
<p>understood steve</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s get back to work here uh</p>
<p>and uh here&rsquo;s our fourth question is it</p>
<p>possible to feel no symptoms with high</p>
<p>blood pressure and our audience roll the</p>
<p>dice on a hundred percent saying yes it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>yeah it is in fact</p>
<p>in fact when the heart becomes weak it</p>
<p>starts to work harder because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not able to put the output</p>
<p>is not be able to uh you&rsquo;re not able to</p>
<p>put the blood flow out like a pump</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a muscle that produces like</p>
<p>a little pump and so now the body has to</p>
<p>compensate and so it compensates by</p>
<p>increasing the pressure and the</p>
<p>retention of sodium and this is why we</p>
<p>have high blood pressure as one of the</p>
<p>cause</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>here you are</p>
<p>you have high blood pressure because of</p>
<p>it but guess what</p>
<p>now we have because of the compensation</p>
<p>we get more blood flow to the tissue and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling great you feel no</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>but you have high blood pressure</p>
<p>then you take a pill to lower the blood</p>
<p>pressure guess what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start seeing those</p>
<p>symptoms again</p>
<p>dizziness lightheadedness being like oh</p>
<p>my gosh i&rsquo;m getting side effects from</p>
<p>the medication</p>
<p>yes and your heart is working harder</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m not mistaken i may have released</p>
<p>that video today if not i&rsquo;ll release it</p>
<p>tomorrow but uh it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting information</p>
<p>about how the body compensates</p>
<p>and you have to understand that these</p>
<p>symptoms you should understand them</p>
<p>instead of treat them</p>
<p>well that sounds very wise a doctor and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>michelle wants your wisdom</p>
<p>on facebook she&rsquo;s nine weeks past an</p>
<p>open compound tibia amphibia fracture</p>
<p>ouch what&rsquo;s the best way to promote bone</p>
<p>growth in healing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d definitely get on a really good</p>
<p>supplement that has the trace minerals</p>
<p>of course with the high quality</p>
<p>available calcium</p>
<p>and vitamin d</p>
<p>and k2 which will make your bones really</p>
<p>solid uh but the trace minerals are</p>
<p>going to be key too because um calcium</p>
<p>is not just about bone you need boron</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>uh zinc a lot of factors uh so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then of course i would do a good</p>
<p>amount of fasting um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna help strengthen and help</p>
<p>you heal</p>
<p>um and also a good amount of vitamin c</p>
<p>from the leafy greens the best source of</p>
<p>vitamin c steve would be</p>
<p>sauerkraut</p>
<p>so anyone also who has digestive</p>
<p>problems should be consuming sauerkraut</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just such a great thing to so it</p>
<p>has the cabbage it&rsquo;s fermented and it</p>
<p>will help your digestion and even if you</p>
<p>have gastritis</p>
<p>apparently you can do sauerkraut out of</p>
<p>all the vegetables cabbage is the best</p>
<p>vegetable for that</p>
<p>wonderful</p>
<p>jimmy from facebook boy a lot of people</p>
<p>have faced this in their family what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best diet for someone with dementia</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>let me let me let&rsquo;s see if i can</p>
<p>remember that if i could if my memory</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m being sarcastic now you need to do</p>
<p>healthy keto and intermittent fasting as</p>
<p>the most important thing for dementia</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>this is all about the brain and the</p>
<p>brain</p>
<p>needs ketones if you feed the brain</p>
<p>ketones it bypasses this dysfunctional</p>
<p>glucose problem with the synapses and</p>
<p>the nerves and your brain will start to</p>
<p>work better</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>and i would also in addition to being</p>
<p>being on the ketogenic plan i would also</p>
<p>take ketones and this is like one time i</p>
<p>would recommend taking ketones exogenous</p>
<p>ketones as a supplement is when you have</p>
<p>dementia or alzheimer&rsquo;s or even</p>
<p>parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or any brain problem</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s hopeful uh and here&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>final question of the day doc</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see here um out of</p>
<p>all 95 nutrients which nutrient</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>is most involved in diabetes</p>
<p>well you gotta sort through all 95. all</p>
<p>right good luck uh audience and by the</p>
<p>way uh for our audience around the world</p>
<p>uh why don&rsquo;t you talk a little bit about</p>
<p>the uh product availability</p>
<p>internationally it&rsquo;s getting better i</p>
<p>think well i&rsquo;m always we have different</p>
<p>channels different um</p>
<p>different languages in russian we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>taiwanese which is actually chinese and</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>arabic channel we have</p>
<p>germany we have german we have french</p>
<p>spanish and so for those of you that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get products because the shipping</p>
<p>is crazy expensive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other links that you can buy the</p>
<p>products so i think we&rsquo;re going to put</p>
<p>those down below</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re constantly working on that to</p>
<p>make these products available</p>
<p>and just as a side note on products in</p>
<p>general just to let you know</p>
<p>you know when you</p>
<p>buy a product</p>
<p>even even companies that sell products</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a lot of times they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know where the source of those</p>
<p>ingredients are so i am working</p>
<p>aggressively on putting that source on</p>
<p>our website so</p>
<p>people can see that we&rsquo;re going quality</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>not trying to get the cheapest thing</p>
<p>from china whatever we want something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely real and that&rsquo;s grown in soils</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>is fertile and that has all the trace</p>
<p>minerals it makes a huge difference</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an amazing book steve i have to</p>
<p>share with you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i showed this last week</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my book of the week can you see</p>
<p>that soil</p>
<p>grass</p>
<p>and cancer</p>
<p>this is my amazing book unfortunately it</p>
<p>was 250 250 dollars</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t find a used one and i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to buy it until it haunted me</p>
<p>because i was thinking what i was like</p>
<p>it must be good if it&rsquo;s that expensive</p>
<p>and why isn&rsquo;t there any used books and</p>
<p>so i finally got it and it it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible researcher from</p>
<p>france that did a deep dive and</p>
<p>found</p>
<p>these huge relationships between lack of</p>
<p>trace minerals in the soil and what it</p>
<p>does to the plant and the animal and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you our health comes from</p>
<p>the soil</p>
<p>and so the fertility of the soil is what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interested in so we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>research now my own greenhouse as well</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>growing tomatoes i hooked up with a</p>
<p>a huge organization that can start</p>
<p>testing</p>
<p>uh all the phytonutrients and so i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>talking about that and then we can</p>
<p>share this with everyone else so they</p>
<p>should start growing their own gardens</p>
<p>and their food if possible</p>
<p>uh so there&rsquo;s some really cool things</p>
<p>coming down in the in the pipeline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just wonderful and we were so</p>
<p>efficient and so was our audience that</p>
<p>we were able to get to all five</p>
<p>questions and the last one asked out of</p>
<p>all 95 nutrients which nutrient</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>is involved in diabetes the audience</p>
<p>came back 45 percent of them with zinc</p>
<p>is deficient 30 say chromium is</p>
<p>deficient and 10 say b1 and 10 say</p>
<p>magnesium and 5</p>
<p>say potassium thank you for that</p>
<p>thorough study uh terry what do you say</p>
<p>doc well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saddening steve to that uh</p>
<p>that this tells me that only five</p>
<p>percent of the people on social media</p>
<p>watched my recent video that i talked</p>
<p>about this and i revealed this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>potassium you need potassium for</p>
<p>for diabetes it&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>nutrient so now i know</p>
<p>uh who&rsquo;s watching my videos and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not so i think you guys need to step it</p>
<p>up start watching more videos and get</p>
<p>these get this information so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can stay healthy oh audience 95 of</p>
<p>you fell short of the answer that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>right just encourage you to study more</p>
<p>of dr berg&rsquo;s videos and let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a few minutes left</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go to another question</p>
<p>because again we love our social media</p>
<p>attendees hans gu</p>
<p>from youtube has lost 30 um</p>
<p>kilograms that&rsquo;s great on keto and iaf</p>
<p>and very grateful for all your videos</p>
<p>but now</p>
<p>a sad result from that is he has a lot</p>
<p>of loose skin around his stomach what</p>
<p>can hans do</p>
<p>well um the the</p>
<p>the skin is the an organ it&rsquo;s one it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the largest organ of the body and so</p>
<p>what you want to do is you want to start</p>
<p>doing a combination of a lot more</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>a lot more periodic prolonged fasting</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>to start to create this condition of</p>
<p>autophagy an autophagy is the recycling</p>
<p>of old damaged proteins as in skin</p>
<p>tissue to start to bring this thing back</p>
<p>you know and if</p>
<p>if you were 700 pounds like we had one</p>
<p>gentleman and they had lost</p>
<p>and he went down to 200 pounds and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have extra skin</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going to have extra</p>
<p>skin you&rsquo;re probably going to have to</p>
<p>have surgery but i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to come back but if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>moderate or minor amount i think you can</p>
<p>do something about it</p>
<p>it just does it does take some time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well doc speaking of time</p>
<p>listen everyone i really appreciate your</p>
<p>questions you guys were amazing and um</p>
<p>thank you for at least the five percent</p>
<p>that are watching my videos</p>
<p>stay tuned for more um content that i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna like this come up</p>
<p>coming next week and i&rsquo;ll see you on</p>
