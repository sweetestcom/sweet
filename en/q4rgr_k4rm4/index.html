fear fear triggers adrenaline so does exercise excitement physical threat and hypoglycemia low blood sugar can all trigger adrenaline now let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what adrenaline does it increases your heart rate sweating vasodilation of both the lung tissue so you can breathe better as well as the heart the coronary artery vasodilates when there&amp;rsquo;s adrenaline getting more oxygen and blood to the heart muscle tissue this is one of the reasons why you probably have seen movies where they&amp;rsquo;ve injected someone into the heart with adrenaline to revive them adrenaline makes your body stronger more alert because it&amp;rsquo;s part of the flight or fight mechanism you&amp;rsquo;re being chased by a tiger right it releases glucose from your liver and your muscles for quick energy and it triggers this other hormone right here which relates to something called the hpa axis the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal axis this is a little different mechanism where you&amp;rsquo;re increasing cortisol which is the other stress hormone so both adrenaline and cortisol are preparing the body for a stress state the difference is adrenaline is is what within seconds cortisol takes a few minutes to kick in cortisol is more long-lasting adrenaline is more short-lived now i&amp;rsquo;ll never forget when i was in wrestling i wrestled in 9th grade 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade in the first year of college until i fractured my neck but in high school i wrestled at 185 pounds which by the way that&amp;rsquo;s actually my weight right now but there&amp;rsquo;s only one more weight class above this which is heavyweight so when we had a meet i would literally have to wait for all these wrestlers to wrestle before it was my opportunity and so there was a lot of excitement there was a lot of fear going on i remember trying to relax and rest underneath the bleachers before the match because i literally had to wait probably i don&amp;rsquo;t know an hour and a half before i wrestled and so i was laying there and i felt my heart rate beating through my chest just boom boom boom boom i was sweating i had a lot of energy flowing through my body so i was not about to take a nap i was not about to feel calm i was basically in an adrenaline mode for about an hour and a half and so what happened that drained my energy so by the time i was ready to wrestle i was completely exhausted but somehow i pushed through it so short-term adrenaline is good chronic exposure to too much adrenaline is very very bad because it burns you out it can burn out the adrenals it can affect the heart it can affect your mood you can actually have a lower tolerance for stress it can actually prevent you from going into a relaxing sleep if there&amp;rsquo;s a little too much adrenaline flowing through your body here&amp;rsquo;s the thing with adrenaline adrenaline is made by the inside of your adrenals called the adrenal medulla and this adrenaline which is a neurotransmitter it&amp;rsquo;s like a hormone but it travels through the nervous system is part of the sympathetic nervous system it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the on switch to stress the off switch which is called the parasympathetic is not in the adrenals so the unique thing about the adrenals it&amp;rsquo;s 100% sympathetic nervous system and there&amp;rsquo;s no parasympathetic innervation in the inside of the adrenal in other words there&amp;rsquo;s no off switch and so if you chronically stimulate the adrenals with any of these over a period of time the adrenals tend to stay on and they don&amp;rsquo;t turn off that well and so here you are you can&amp;rsquo;t sleep you can&amp;rsquo;t relax you feel stress all the time and then that&amp;rsquo;s going to activate more cortisol and then you get belly fat so the question is what can you do about it this is really not a nutritional problem this is a stress problem so you need to disconnect from the stress or somehow handle the stress whatever that stress is if it&amp;rsquo;s certain groups of people or a person you need to handle that that includes turning off the tv so you&amp;rsquo;re not watching the news every night changing your environment sleeping more there&amp;rsquo;s some really good important nutritional things you can do to help but without handling this right here these really won&amp;rsquo;t create a big impact but vitamin b1 is at the top of the list if you take b1 or nutritional yeast you&amp;rsquo;re going to feel a sense of relief vitamin d vitally important and vitamin c because your adrenals need vitamin c both adrenaline and cortisol without vitamin c your adrenal glands do not work but let me come back to this little point right here hypoglycemia and what causes hypoglycemia what has the capacity to push your blood sugars down and the answer to that is insulin and what triggers that you guessed it a high carbohydrate diet being on a high carbohydrate diet keeps your body in flight or fight mode activating adrenaline and creating a situation where it&amp;rsquo;s going to be really hard to lose weight so just by changing your diet going on a low carb diet guess what can happen you can help to restore normal levels of adrenaline and this is why when people do the keto diet they feel calmer they feel less stressed if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel i put a link down below of exactly what you should be eating hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today"><title>What Emotion Triggers Adrenaline？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

so does exercise excitement  </p><p>physical threat and hypoglycemia low blood 
sugar can all trigger adrenaline now let&rsquo;s  </p><p>take a look at what adrenaline does it increases 
your heart rate sweating vasodilation of both the  </p><p>lung tissue so you can breathe better as well 
as the heart the coronary artery vasodilates  </p><p>when there&rsquo;s adrenaline getting more oxygen and 
blood to the heart muscle tissue this is one of  </p><p>the reasons why you probably have seen movies 
where they&rsquo;ve injected someone into the heart  </p><p>with adrenaline to revive them adrenaline makes 
your body stronger more alert because it&rsquo;s part  </p><p>of the flight or fight mechanism you&rsquo;re being 
chased by a tiger right it releases glucose from  </p><p>your liver and your muscles for quick energy 
and it triggers this other hormone right here  </p><p>which relates to something called the hpa axis 
the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal axis  </p><p>this is a little different mechanism where 
you&rsquo;re increasing cortisol which is the other  </p><p>stress hormone so both adrenaline and cortisol 
are preparing the body for a stress state  </p><p>the difference is adrenaline is is what within 
seconds cortisol takes a few minutes to kick in  </p><p>cortisol is more long-lasting adrenaline is 
more short-lived now i&rsquo;ll never forget when  </p><p>i was in wrestling i wrestled in 9th grade 10th 
grade 11th grade 12th grade in the first year  </p><p>of college until i fractured my neck but 
in high school i wrestled at 185 pounds  </p><p>which by the way that&rsquo;s actually my weight 
right now but there&rsquo;s only one more weight  </p><p>class above this which is heavyweight so when 
we had a meet i would literally have to wait for  </p><p>all these wrestlers to wrestle before it was my 
opportunity and so there was a lot of excitement  </p><p>there was a lot of fear going on i remember trying 
to relax and rest underneath the bleachers before  </p><p>the match because i literally had to wait probably 
i don&rsquo;t know an hour and a half before i wrestled  </p><p>and so i was laying there and i felt my heart rate 
beating through my chest just boom boom boom boom  </p><p>i was sweating i had a lot of energy flowing 
through my body so i was not about to take a nap  </p><p>i was not about to feel calm i was basically in 
an adrenaline mode for about an hour and a half  </p><p>and so what happened that drained my energy 
so by the time i was ready to wrestle i was  </p><p>completely exhausted but somehow i pushed 
through it so short-term adrenaline is good  </p><p>chronic exposure to too much adrenaline is very 
very bad because it burns you out it can burn out  </p><p>the adrenals it can affect the heart it can affect 
your mood you can actually have a lower tolerance  </p><p>for stress it can actually prevent you from going 
into a relaxing sleep if there&rsquo;s a little too much  </p><p>adrenaline flowing through your body here&rsquo;s the 
thing with adrenaline adrenaline is made by the  </p><p>inside of your adrenals called the adrenal medulla 
and this adrenaline which is a neurotransmitter  </p><p>it&rsquo;s like a hormone but it travels through the 
nervous system is part of the sympathetic nervous  </p><p>system it&rsquo;s kind of like the on switch to stress 
the off switch which is called the parasympathetic  </p><p>is not in the adrenals so the unique thing about 
the adrenals it&rsquo;s 100% sympathetic nervous system  </p><p>and there&rsquo;s no parasympathetic innervation in the 
inside of the adrenal in other words there&rsquo;s no  </p><p>off switch and so if you chronically stimulate the 
adrenals with any of these over a period of time  </p><p>the adrenals tend to stay on and they don&rsquo;t turn 
off that well and so here you are you can&rsquo;t sleep  </p><p>you can&rsquo;t relax you feel stress all the time and 
then that&rsquo;s going to activate more cortisol and  </p><p>then you get belly fat so the question is what can 
you do about it this is really not a nutritional  </p><p>problem this is a stress problem so you need to 
disconnect from the stress or somehow handle the  </p><p>stress whatever that stress is if it&rsquo;s certain 
groups of people or a person you need to handle  </p><p>that that includes turning off the tv so you&rsquo;re 
not watching the news every night changing your  </p><p>environment sleeping more there&rsquo;s some really good 
important nutritional things you can do to help  </p><p>but without handling this right here these really 
won&rsquo;t create a big impact but vitamin b1 is at the  </p><p>top of the list if you take b1 or nutritional 
yeast you&rsquo;re going to feel a sense of relief  </p><p>vitamin d vitally important and vitamin 
c because your adrenals need vitamin c  </p><p>both adrenaline and cortisol without vitamin c 
your adrenal glands do not work but let me come  </p><p>back to this little point right here hypoglycemia 
and what causes hypoglycemia what has the capacity  </p><p>to push your blood sugars down and the answer 
to that is insulin and what triggers that you  </p><p>guessed it a high carbohydrate diet being on a 
high carbohydrate diet keeps your body in flight  </p><p>or fight mode activating adrenaline and creating 
a situation where it&rsquo;s going to be really hard  </p><p>to lose weight so just by changing your diet going 
on a low carb diet guess what can happen you can  </p><p>help to restore normal levels of adrenaline 
and this is why when people do the keto diet  </p><p>they feel calmer they feel less stressed if 
you&rsquo;re new to my channel i put a link down below  </p><p>of exactly what you should be eating hey before 
you go real quick i have a course entitled how  </p><p>to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free 
course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to
