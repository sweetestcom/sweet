<p>jumped into this when my husband was put</p>
<p>on it for by you the great medical</p>
<p>doctor for his cancer than you know</p>
<p>squamous cell in the vocal cords and</p>
<p>this is their new way now controversial</p>
<p>you know in the cancer world to take</p>
<p>them off those smoothies and all of the</p>
<p>juices and put them into a keto diet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice jumping ahead or doing it</p>
<p>you turn down your volume just a tad if</p>
<p>I can hear some no and so with the</p>
<p>squamous cell you should put him on the</p>
<p>keto diet and he was at about 150 before</p>
<p>we started keto he&rsquo;s down to 138 he has</p>
<p>no need to lose weight</p>
<p>and so he&rsquo;s 510 and 138 now he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>about 17 to 1,800 calories a day and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in an 18-6 window with two large</p>
<p>meals no snacks</p>
<p>his blood sugar since she got the flu</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been checking</p>
<p>chiggers for several months now he has a</p>
<p>lot but he&rsquo;s a scientist he has he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been very good about that</p>
<p>one thing he&rsquo;s noticed when he caught</p>
<p>the flu at in December and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>getting over it now is that it made his</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s changed at night and his</p>
<p>fasting blood sugar went up again about</p>
<p>10 degrees about 10 points higher than</p>
<p>you would normally be and then in the</p>
<p>morning it was actually higher when he</p>
<p>woke up instead of being lower like it</p>
<p>normally Abbot can you think of any</p>
<p>reason why this is happening and how we</p>
<p>can like help him keep some more weight</p>
<p>on with the current brain which we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that we&rsquo;re doing now 80% fat 20%</p>
<p>protein and about five to ten percent</p>
<p>Club and his glucose is changing from</p>
<p>about 95 to a mill over 100 between</p>
<p>11:00 p.m. and 8:00 8:00 a.m. okay good</p>
<p>so cam a couple things because it&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>you have you have two situations right</p>
<p>now you have someone that wants to</p>
<p>improve their immune system as much as</p>
<p>possible he had some cancer and then at</p>
<p>the same time he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep</p>
<p>losing weight because the immune system</p>
<p>is going to be improved when he does in</p>
<p>a minute of fasting so and of course if</p>
<p>you try to push it to one meal a day he</p>
<p>probably will might lose a little bit</p>
<p>more weight so he&rsquo;s going to have to eat</p>
<p>a little bit more so it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>juggle between getting enough calories</p>
<p>and and doing the in a minute fasting</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s gonna have he could</p>
<p>probably add the weights in there now to</p>
<p>try to maybe increase more muscle mass</p>
<p>but the point is that I think two meals</p>
<p>are going to be good for him and then</p>
<p>just increase a little bit more calorie</p>
<p>now as far as the flu which is viral and</p>
<p>the blood sure is going up what happens</p>
<p>when your immune system kicks in guess</p>
<p>what you get a spike of cortisol</p>
<p>cortisol is the the main hormones that</p>
<p>is supposed to support the white blood</p>
<p>cells okay that&rsquo;s why when you get sick</p>
<p>or any type of infection they inject you</p>
<p>with a steroid which is cortisone and so</p>
<p>cortisol is an immune suppressor okay</p>
<p>so as soon as you kick in like a viral</p>
<p>thing and then Ulsan the coral goes up</p>
<p>cortisol releases sugar can it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>glucose releasing thing so you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>release low sugar and there goes the</p>
<p>spike that&rsquo;s the relationship so the</p>
<p>goal is just to get the immune system up</p>
<p>and then the sugars will come down but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the mechanism good question</p>
<p>though</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s go to Mandy she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>waiting for 24 minutes and you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Flagstaff Arizona go ahead Mandy oh this</p>
<p>is Randy and Mike&rsquo;s dad</p>
<p>Oh Randy okay sorry got a typo there I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t Randy oh yeah I&rsquo;m very good thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>I listened to her first video about</p>
<p>December 2nd just on apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and that was a day I kind of decided to</p>
<p>cut out all sugar because I had a couple</p>
<p>joints and my fingers are just starting</p>
<p>a little bit sore and as I started</p>
<p>listening to peel your videos on YouTube</p>
<p>I decided to cut out all snacking too</p>
<p>and then so in the past 7 weeks I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost 24 pounds Wow by cutting snacking</p>
<p>through her alone Wow and I did when I</p>
<p>did that I realized I was already on a</p>
<p>keto diet so I basically use vegetable</p>
<p>salads and fish and meat anyway right so</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do anything but I have a hard</p>
<p>time trying to keep up with like your 10</p>
<p>cups of salad right now it&rsquo;s all I can</p>
<p>do to you it is like a half a salad and</p>
<p>they may be some meat and then I might</p>
<p>eat breakfast around 2:00 after 2:00 in</p>
<p>the afternoon and then dinner around 5</p>
<p>to 4 to 7 yeah so now I&rsquo;m down at like</p>
<p>one meal a day and maybe every other day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a breakfast okay I have a hard</p>
<p>time much food at one time but I do also</p>
<p>do your seek help your your electrolyte</p>
<p>powder I do that every day then with</p>
<p>lemon juice in water as well at the the</p>
<p>organic lemon okay</p>
<p>and I do the Auriga news and your</p>
<p>cruciferous caps every day to kind of</p>
<p>make up maybe for the salad I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>yeah enough do you still want to lose my</p>
<p>pardon do you still want to lose weight</p>
<p>yeah I I&rsquo;m only 5'4 and in the weight I</p>
<p>was up until I mid-40s was like 135 then</p>
<p>of my 50 late 50s I got the 145 men in</p>
<p>my 60s now I got up to 163 and I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to get down to maybe 130 pounds or so</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>let me give you some tips on that okay</p>
<p>yeah so I think I think you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>really really good and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to consume that massive amount of</p>
<p>vegetables which I&rsquo;m telling you it is</p>
<p>difficult to do that but now if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing two meals I might do one of the</p>
<p>meals I might do most of the vegetable</p>
<p>and a little protein and the other may</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do more protein more fat so because</p>
<p>it is difficult if you&rsquo;re doing one meal</p>
<p>to consume 7 to 10 cups of vegetables so</p>
<p>I do understand that so a couple things</p>
<p>that you can do one is to maybe spread</p>
<p>that one meal a little bit further apart</p>
<p>so maybe it&rsquo;s like one hour of like you</p>
<p>eat it and then you wait an hour and</p>
<p>then eat the protein you know that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>way the other thing you can do is blend</p>
<p>the kale you probably already doing this</p>
<p>but I just want to let you know I like</p>
<p>to take kale pack the blender up and if</p>
<p>you still want to lose weight and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to add berries and I have the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder you already have this</p>
<p>you can use the electrolyte powder which</p>
<p>is no sugar or the wheat grass which</p>
<p>lemon which has no sugar as a sweetener</p>
<p>and you put that in there instead of the</p>
<p>fruit add the water and it&rsquo;ll be sweet</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like just pure kale and no</p>
<p>sugar that will that&rsquo;s a great way to</p>
<p>drink your vegetables to get a little</p>
<p>bit more so that&rsquo;s kind of a couple</p>
<p>little tips there but I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing great and the the the purpose of</p>
<p>pushing up those vegetables is just to</p>
<p>make sure that your liver doesn&rsquo;t end up</p>
<p>fatty and just to get all the nutrients</p>
<p>but I think what you&rsquo;re doing now is</p>
<p>good you&rsquo;re enhancing the potassium and</p>
<p>and I would just kind of take that one</p>
<p>meal and just spread it out a little bit</p>
<p>longer so you&rsquo;re not cramming</p>
<p>all this food and one sitting thanks</p>
<p>Randy alright and we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Karen is there any questions over here</p>
<p>Ken yeah YouTube Facebook is in the</p>
<p>house I just had to say that yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna start over here with YouTube we</p>
<p>have mommy and Tori post it says dr.</p>
<p>Burke I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of heart</p>
<p>palpitations with MCT oil I read</p>
<p>somewhere this could be due to die-off</p>
<p>symptoms since MC cheese and anti-fungal</p>
<p>is this true no that&rsquo;s false it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>die-off at all what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of pushing a bit of fat for</p>
<p>the gallbladder to work a little harder</p>
<p>and so what happens is that congestion</p>
<p>kind of backs up a little bit on the</p>
<p>liver which is right and connected to</p>
<p>the rib cage which is right next to the</p>
<p>heart so the liver is connected to the</p>
<p>heart which is connected to it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>connect it&rsquo;s all putting pressure on the</p>
<p>heart a little bit and that could</p>
<p>stimulate the little nerves that go to</p>
<p>the heart that&rsquo;s called the pacemaker</p>
<p>and that could throw off the rhythm a</p>
<p>little bit that&rsquo;s probably what it is so</p>
<p>there is a connection between the</p>
<p>gallbladder fats and heart rhythm that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s happening all right</p>
<p>interesting that leads right into my</p>
<p>next question we have on Facebook we</p>
<p>have Jasmine who&rsquo;s asking can you do</p>
<p>keto without a gallbladder well I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done a lot of videos and that&rsquo;s a common</p>
<p>question and you absolutely can do keto</p>
<p>in fact you should do keto without a</p>
<p>gallbladder the only thing you have to</p>
<p>realize without a gallbladder you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to have the sufficient</p>
<p>concentrated amount of bile which what</p>
<p>does that mean Dani mean you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough bile that means Karen the</p>
<p>significance of that means that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only gonna digest 50% of your fat</p>
<p>instead of like 98% of your fat so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll put a little more stress on the</p>
<p>pancreas because they work together now</p>
<p>the pancreas has to make a little bit</p>
<p>more enzyme lipase to do the work so but</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t get a hundred percent of</p>
<p>our full breakdown of the fat fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins out of an A d e and K</p>
<p>and the other essential fatty acids</p>
<p>which are necessary for the cell</p>
<p>membranes and the hormones and all sorts</p>
<p>of things so but you might not see any</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>right off the bat they take a long time</p>
<p>because their fat soluble vitamins that</p>
<p>kind of gets stored over a long period</p>
<p>of time so I would add a little bit of</p>
<p>bile in into your meals like you can</p>
<p>take something called gall bladder</p>
<p>Formula One after a meal and I think</p>
<p>that will be enough for the whole day if</p>
<p>you did that you&rsquo;ll be fine and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably not have any deficiencies of</p>
<p>the fat size of vitamins so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I recommend Karen very good now at the</p>
<p>end of this show I always like to kind</p>
<p>of give some really valuable information</p>
<p>so yeah that&rsquo;s right last week we talked</p>
<p>about the ten worst diet tips this</p>
<p>weekend I think it was seven seven</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more bet</p>
<p>so this weekend yeah I&rsquo;m gonna reveal</p>
<p>yeah the absolute best nut on the key</p>
<p>dough and the worst nut on the keto diet</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and in addition I&rsquo;m gonna talk about the</p>
<p>absolute best berry you can consume in</p>
<p>the worst berry so you have to know this</p>
<p>diable formation good this is gonna be</p>
<p>really good good and there&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>bonus gift that we are going to share</p>
<p>with you at the end wow there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s just gonna be</p>
<p>bountiful it&rsquo;s gonna be exciting to end</p>
<p>it is so stay tuned</p>
<p>hey Rachel you&rsquo;re from Detroit you had a</p>
<p>question go ahead I do can I just say</p>
<p>that I believe that you&rsquo;re a Johnson oh</p>
<p>thanks I let you do so my question is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a two-part question kinda so I have</p>
<p>had colitis as a young girl so I had my</p>
<p>large bowel removed and I have a J pouch</p>
<p>now everything gets reconnected and I</p>
<p>also have my gallbladder take it out a</p>
<p>few years later I have in the last two</p>
<p>years lost 118 pounds just by I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dieting and exercising but throughout</p>
<p>that process I have also I have large</p>
<p>ovarian cysts where the doctors want to</p>
<p>do a hysterectomy and I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>so I have decided to cut a lot of</p>
<p>hormones</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that all the things I have</p>
<p>done over the years not taking care of</p>
<p>my body ate it to those cysts and so I</p>
<p>am doing a different diet now which is</p>
<p>kind of like the keto diet from you but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only eating seafood with lots of</p>
<p>vegetables cut out the sugars and the</p>
<p>cards as well I&rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in one</p>
<p>week just from doing this I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s how it should be but I have</p>
<p>and so my question is always am I</p>
<p>getting the right nutrients because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware that the things don&rsquo;t kind of stay</p>
<p>in my system as long because all I have</p>
<p>is a small bowel so my school kind of</p>
<p>goes in and it comes out the same thing</p>
<p>all right yeah that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>are you doing any intimate of fasting</p>
<p>Rachel I am I&rsquo;m going to meals a day and</p>
<p>from that I have lost 10 pounds in one</p>
<p>week literally was like five days um and</p>
<p>I feel great</p>
<p>I do the sugar addiction I have is</p>
<p>Society and I&rsquo;m drinking lots of water</p>
<p>so thank you your videos are very</p>
<p>informational you&rsquo;re welcome let me give</p>
<p>you some tips okay okay okay so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing you lost weight</p>
<p>a ton of weight before we even started</p>
<p>Aikido okay so probably what happened is</p>
<p>you had an underlying insulin resistance</p>
<p>issue that now it&rsquo;s going to be improved</p>
<p>but before you know if you lose weight</p>
<p>without improving that you may not still</p>
<p>be able to have the optimum absorption</p>
<p>of amino acids which is protein thus the</p>
<p>maybe the skin is sagging a little bit</p>
<p>too much now doing in a minute fasting</p>
<p>combined with keto is going to be key</p>
<p>for your tone of your skin the quality</p>
<p>of skin and collagen and joints so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to actually improve over</p>
<p>the next year or so now here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a large bow I think you</p>
<p>just have a small intestine so we&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder so you need to</p>
<p>find where that went and get it back and</p>
<p>make someone to insert it back in there</p>
<p>I have some spare ones in the back we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>send you in the mail but the thing that</p>
<p>you need to do is you need</p>
<p>to try to push to one meal a day because</p>
<p>that way you can really take your let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>call it aa Fuji which is a recycling of</p>
<p>proteins to the next level which is</p>
<p>going to be really good for you but the</p>
<p>problem is without a large bowel and</p>
<p>adding all the vegetables that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending all the fiber you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be able to absorb those fibers</p>
<p>or utilize those fibers like you would</p>
<p>so you might kind of you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to consume a little less of the fibers</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just going to go right through</p>
<p>you because you can&rsquo;t ferment them</p>
<p>correctly</p>
<p>so that being said there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>nutrients that you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>probably take in addition to food one is</p>
<p>the the trace minerals very important</p>
<p>and minerals so get a plant-based trace</p>
<p>minerals and just minerals like the</p>
<p>electrolyte I think that&rsquo;ll be important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to get that from the</p>
<p>food I love the fact that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the seafood that&rsquo;s great keep doing it</p>
<p>because you that&rsquo;s going to help the</p>
<p>cysts on the ovaries because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>high estrogen and sea kelp will help</p>
<p>them and then the other thing that you</p>
<p>might need to substitute is B vitamins</p>
<p>and lastly some of the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins because you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder self you might want to do</p>
<p>instead of taking the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins individually consumed maybe</p>
<p>some bile salts after the meal and then</p>
<p>at that meal have some healthy fats so</p>
<p>you can just absorb the the fat side</p>
<p>vitamins from the food that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating rather than add the fat side with</p>
<p>vitamins from an external source okay</p>
<p>all right well thanks so much Rachel</p>
<p>good question now Karen we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go to you do you have a quick question</p>
<p>here no it&rsquo;s a very long question okay</p>
<p>but I know you&rsquo;ll answer it so we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>to YouTube here I have Kalinda</p>
<p>who says I&rsquo;m a vegetarian from birth I</p>
<p>do eat lots of fats blood sugar pressure</p>
<p>and thyroxine levels are normal however</p>
<p>triglycerides are high has back pain</p>
<p>lost a few pounds doing your program I</p>
<p>guess doesn&rsquo;t say exactly okay so if you</p>
<p>have triglycerides which by the way are</p>
<p>blood fats</p>
<p>you typically are going to use some of</p>
<p>the triglycerides and that&rsquo;s as fuel for</p>
<p>the body okay so you can use this as</p>
<p>fuel the the problem is if it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>that typically means your carb is a bit</p>
<p>too high your carve level and because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a vegan that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s challenging</p>
<p>because of the higher amounts of</p>
<p>carbohydrates and vegan food so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re eating I would just</p>
<p>analyze that based on trying to get your</p>
<p>carbs down right about 30 grams per day</p>
<p>that might be tough but that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>bring the triglycerides down to a much</p>
<p>better level I did create a video you</p>
<p>can watch just type dr. Berg on YouTube</p>
<p>and vegan and you know it&rsquo;ll come up</p>
<p>with some ideas of what you can eat</p>
<p>you do eat a lot of fat that&rsquo;s good but</p>
<p>I think we just have to figure out how</p>
<p>to reduce some of the carbs in your diet</p>
<p>okay okay great I have another one okay</p>
<p>so a lot of questions coming in about</p>
<p>calories some people still have</p>
<p>attention on calories how many calories</p>
<p>is too many calories how many calories</p>
<p>should you take an on keto so take that</p>
<p>one yeah I have a video on that too</p>
<p>actually is there something you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a video on one actually there is</p>
<p>what no you don&rsquo;t have no and Karen</p>
<p>since you just brought that up there is</p>
<p>and this is not the right format but</p>
<p>this is a little form that were you can</p>
<p>download okay there&rsquo;s a link down below</p>
<p>you can download it and it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>wait a minute a summary this is the</p>
<p>bonus at the end oh well I guess I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving you a really bonus I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this was the bonus okay okay so anyway</p>
<p>now that I open up and the worms okay so</p>
<p>basically this is a sheet it&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>keto and in a min fasting sheet every</p>
<p>single video there&rsquo;s a lot of videos on</p>
<p>here you can click and watch it and get</p>
<p>your question answered but you want me</p>
<p>to answer this question though your</p>
<p>calories okay so here&rsquo;s the thing about</p>
<p>calories I think that the the challenge</p>
<p>is going from three meals a day let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re doing three meals a day</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>between 1500</p>
<ul>
<li>1800 calories okay if you really want</li>
</ul>
<p>to know but those calories must be you</p>
<p>know three to six ounces of protein and</p>
<p>a lot of vegetables and fat so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to go to you know it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>book of giving examples and things but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to give you details of</p>
<p>that but I have some videos as well but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what you want to look at</p>
<p>as far as calories now as you reduce</p>
<p>your number of meals you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>keep your calories the same it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible if you&rsquo;re gonna do a one meal</p>
<p>1800 calorie meal Karen that is a lot of</p>
<p>food so you can&rsquo;t digest that so but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the cool thing as you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting the need for food goes</p>
<p>down so if you&rsquo;re doing one meal a day</p>
<p>and why is that because your body&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>efficient and you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>conservation of nutrients ideally</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s burning my own fat right</p>
<p>the meal that you&rsquo;re eating is your own</p>
<p>fat so you got to think of like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing one meal and you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>thousand calorie meal it reminds me of</p>
<p>that commercial I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m cleaning my oven</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a so remember that yeah the lady</p>
<p>was out somewhere no don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so right now ideally we&rsquo;re all having a</p>
<p>meal of our own fat yeah if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating you&rsquo;re having a meal you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating your body&rsquo;s eating your own fat</p>
<p>as the meal so you&rsquo;re not starving so</p>
<p>really if you look at the actual</p>
<p>external calories that you&rsquo;re putting in</p>
<p>the body Karen yeah that one meal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably gonna be about thousand</p>
<p>thousand calories maybe 1,200 calories</p>
<p>alright okay so that&rsquo;s and you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>satisfied with that but it might be like</p>
<p>mentally you might think wow I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting enough food but but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuffed okay so it&rsquo;s gonna be okay so I</p>

<p>they&rsquo;re very cool so a lot of recipes so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Lilian from Maryland</p>
<p>hi Lillian hi thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call sure I&rsquo;m 83 years old I need to</p>
<p>lose at least 15 pounds and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hypoglycemia and hypothyroid I&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>pacemaker and I go into afib and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t seem to lose anyway</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder and no matter</p>
<p>what I do I tried to do like two meals</p>
<p>but my blood sugar drops right okay I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what body type I</p>
<p>but I seem to like when I eat nuts I</p>
<p>break out on my face it was a little</p>
<p>white bumps on it and I was wondering</p>
<p>what I could do to really lose this</p>
<p>weight okay good so and I will be</p>
<p>sending you a spare gall bladder in the</p>
<p>mail so I&rsquo;ll get your address after this</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m being right I&rsquo;m being really</p>
<p>totally joking sarcastic the story of my</p>
<p>life he says something and I&rsquo;m standing</p>
<p>next to him and I say he&rsquo;s joking he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just joking I like that so let me tell</p>
<p>you what to do it Lillian</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing right now is the fact that you</p>
<p>have and by the way what I&rsquo;m gonna tell</p>
<p>you is now I meant to diagnose you or</p>
<p>give you medical advice everything that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying is for your own entertainment</p>
<p>okay and your you and your doctor okay</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the point because you have</p>
<p>atrial fib chances alright you need some</p>
<p>more electrolytes specifically potassium</p>
<p>by taking extra potassium that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to greatly greatly assist in improving</p>
<p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening with</p>
<p>hypoglycemia is you can&rsquo;t go from one</p>
<p>meal to the next I&rsquo;ve done a lot of</p>
<p>videos on this so you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>add a lot more fat to the meal but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not all you have to add potassium</p>
<p>potassium improves insulin resistance</p>
<p>which means that your body now doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to jack up your insulin so high so</p>
<p>hypoglycemics have high levels of</p>
<p>insulin that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s pushing the blood</p>
<p>sugars down and the adrenals might be we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t push it back up so if you were</p>
<p>just to have a meal and the first thing</p>
<p>you eat is a huge salad and then add</p>
<p>some minerals add the fat in there</p>
<p>episode of vinegar that&rsquo;s gonna help you</p>
<p>okay go longer and just do that</p>
<p>consistently all of a sudden you&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>longer longer longer and now you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need the snack anymore and then the</p>
<p>hypoglycemic thing goes away and then</p>
<p>the weight loss happens but the reason</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re not losing enough weight</p>
<p>right now is simply because you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>have a blood sugar thing so your goal</p>
<p>right now should just to improve the</p>
<p>hypoglycemic reaction don&rsquo;t do nuts do</p>
<p>some other fat and then watch what</p>
<p>happens to the weight the way it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to come next</p>
<p>but you might need to substitute maybes</p>
<p>for the gallbladder support and then</p>
<p>also electrolytes for the atrial fib</p>
<p>just to speed things up</p>
<p>okay thanks Lilia so we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Lori&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s from Florida you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in a minute fasting right now taking the</p>
<p>kale shakes but you still have restless</p>
<p>legs yes and sometimes it&rsquo;s my whole</p>
<p>body I&rsquo;m adding to the kill shakes</p>
<p>turmeric black pepper electrolyte powder</p>
<p>grass juice powder and non fortified</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and then at night when</p>
<p>I have those problems I take a little</p>
<p>bit of magnesium chloride and calcium</p>
<p>citrate and usually battles that&rsquo;ll stop</p>
<p>it but last night it didn&rsquo;t it just like</p>
<p>my whole body and it&rsquo;s just and I it</p>
<p>went boy for a while then it came back</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering am i adding too much</p>
<p>of something in or do I need to add</p>
<p>something else okay are you I want to</p>
<p>thank you dr. Burke for everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done you have changed my life</p>
<p>giving me hope I can control my help and</p>
<p>my weight for the rest of my life and I</p>
<p>just thank you so much my pleasure okay</p>
<p>thank you how many times are you eating</p>
<p>a day twice okay I have you been doing</p>
<p>this a while or are you just getting</p>
<p>started I&rsquo;ve been keto adapting for I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;ve been on keto for quite a while</p>
<p>the two meals a day it&rsquo;s been maybe a</p>
<p>couple weeks okay</p>
<p>and before this did you have more</p>
<p>restless legs or is this a new thing now</p>
<p>is it actually shaking or is it like a</p>
<p>vibration that you just like you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t just relax with the legs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like something crawling okay and</p>
<p>you know I just keep moving them around</p>
<p>and wiggling my toes and stuff and</p>
<p>finally I just like I can&rsquo;t stand this I</p>
<p>get up and take a couple of things and</p>
<p>for the most part the magnesium and</p>
<p>calcium seems to help last night it just</p>
<p>it just didn&rsquo;t I think I know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on I&rsquo;m thinking maybe I&rsquo;m adding</p>
<p>too much okay good yeah I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pH problem because when you when you do</p>
<p>the Kido you&rsquo;re gonna ketones are acidic</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going to happen your pH might</p>
<p>become a little bit more acidic and if</p>
<p>the pH is more acidic what happens is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t hold the calcium as much and</p>
<p>that could you could make you feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crawling which interest what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about that is accounts and</p>
<p>efficiency and a calcium excess can</p>
<p>actually give you the same symptom so I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a calcium deficiency so what</p>
<p>I think you should do</p>
<p>add a little calcium not the magnesium</p>
<p>you can go with more of the calcium</p>
<p>right before bed and see if that</p>
<p>crawling goes away it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>calcium or you might need an omega-3 but</p>
<p>I think your pH is a little too acidic</p>
<p>and we need to like alkyl as it just a</p>
<p>little bit okay all right thanks for</p>
<p>calling all right Karen okay over to you</p>
<p>okay good I have three so the first one</p>
<p>is does MCT oil in a drink in whatever</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re fasting break your fast</p>
<p>okay so it depends how much you have if</p>
<p>you have a teaspoon probably not if you</p>
<p>have a lot yes because it&rsquo;s a fat and</p>
<p>you got to think like this anything that</p>
<p>requires a bit of calories to digest</p>
<p>will spike the insulin but if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually going to compare let&rsquo;s say a</p>
<p>tablespoon of MCT oil versus not a right</p>
<p>or 1/4 of a glass of orange juice it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the oil is going to be</p>
<p>insignificant so it&rsquo;s gonna be very</p>
<p>minor so it&rsquo;ll be a little thing but not</p>
<p>nearly what the juice will do it or any</p>
<p>type of sweet or carbohydrate I mean if</p>
<p>you had celery for example a stick of</p>
<p>celery I will promise you that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna stimulate incident too much</p>
<p>right because the whole breaking of the</p>
<p>fast thing is really the question of not</p>
<p>is it breaking my fast but is it spiking</p>
<p>insulin and how much insulin is it</p>
<p>spiking right yeah yes but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating in general it will increase</p>
<p>insulin but the point is that it really</p>
<p>has to do with how much we&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>like if you were to if you have a</p>
<p>problem with high insulin and you do</p>
<p>these massive meals</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see your intimate fasting and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to cram everything down</p>
<p>your throat</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating one meal a day and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going too fast you&rsquo;re gonna spike</p>
<p>insulin because you haven&rsquo;t adapted yet</p>
<p>fully so you just it&rsquo;s a matter of not</p>
<p>over stuffing yourself as well because</p>
<p>it can spike insulin so okay it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little balance there Karen okay good</p>
<p>well I have another question and this</p>
<p>one is from Linda on YouTube she says</p>
<p>her husband had a quadruple bypass he</p>
<p>has high blood pressure he has high</p>
<p>cholesterol can he do kita okay I was</p>
<p>waiting for that question Karen yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s kind of like falls into</p>
<p>the syndrome X or it&rsquo;s called metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome which is a combination between</p>
<p>high blood pressure high cholesterol</p>
<p>high blood glucose and belly fat okay</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so almost hysterical to if you</p>
<p>do to a search on this Wikipedia which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know who wrote this but so</p>
<p>called the experts but it&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we found there there&rsquo;s an association</p>
<p>between high insulin and metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome no no no it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>association it&rsquo;s a cause that problem is</p>
<p>coming directly from a cause which is</p>
<p>high insulin it&rsquo;s not complex it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>unknown insulin will cause that because</p>
<p>if you look under hyperinsulinemia which</p>
<p>is high insulin high blood pressure</p>
<p>stiffening arteries belly fat high</p>
<p>cholesterol so if someone asked me do I</p>
<p>need Aikido well because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing keto that&rsquo;s why you have the</p>
<p>problem it is the only solution that you</p>
<p>can do because you want to drop the carb</p>
<p>I mean think about it</p>
<p>sugars go high and even if you have</p>
<p>diabetes sugars go high hello what do</p>
<p>you need to do you need to drop those</p>
<p>sugars don&rsquo;t eat sugar but people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focusing on that it&rsquo;s like obvious it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the elephant in the room if you have to</p>
<p>drop the sugar so yes do keto intamin</p>
<p>fasting and watch what happens it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>quite miraculous it&rsquo;s good for the heart</p>
<p>perfect and one more okay I have I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an may on facebook saying too many</p>
<p>vegetables kills my gut I tried</p>
<p>carnivore feel amazing but got blood</p>
<p>work done and have high elevated or have</p>
<p>elevated kidney levels could my kidneys</p>
<p>be messed up from dehydration so well I</p>
<p>history but I&rsquo;m just gonna just what I</p>
<p>have I&rsquo;m gonna tell you that if you have</p>
<p>a problem digesting vegetables then go</p>
<p>with fermented vegetables okay fermented</p>
<p>vegetables now here&rsquo;s the thing that one</p>
<p>of the goals of eating vegetables is to</p>
<p>you know provide some fiber so maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to stick with the type</p>
<p>of like I don&rsquo;t know romaine lettuce can</p>
<p>you do that versus all these other</p>
<p>complex vegetables that you probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the bacteria to digest so do</p>
<p>that give your your microfiber but then</p>
<p>you need the nutrients so there&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>only one food that has more nutrients</p>
<p>than vegetables and I want I wanna see</p>
<p>if anyone can guess it right on Facebook</p>
<p>or YouTube so go ahead and okay tell me</p>
<p>get to the bottom here guys we have a</p>
<p>quiz before so tell me what food has way</p>
<p>more nutrients okay then vegetables get</p>
<p>to the bottom here go ahead and give me</p>
<p>your comment and as they come in Karen</p>
<p>tell me so here&rsquo;s the question is</p>
<p>pickled the same as fermented yeah yeah</p>
<p>yep I mean I&rsquo;m looking at my computer</p>
<p>yes eggs kale up we got 521 here on</p>
<p>YouTube says liver okay you were right</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s organ meats yeah so you you may</p>
<p>argue a grass-fed organ meat like a</p>
<p>liverwurst or or some type of kidney and</p>
<p>brain and I know that might sound</p>
<p>disgusting but I&rsquo;m telling you that will</p>
<p>actually give you the nutrients and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually easier to digest then</p>
<p>vegetables for a lot of people okay so</p>
<p>do that right now and you might have to</p>
<p>just substitute for some of the other</p>
<p>minerals that you would normally get</p>
<p>from vegetables so kidney and brain I</p>
<p>just want to take it back a second</p>
<p>kidney they used to do this a long time</p>
<p>rain yeah you can you make a burger out</p>
<p>of that you make a burger burger a</p>
<p>burger brain perk now personally I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t do that but some people</p>
<p>like it I think it knew that but why you</p>
<p>try that but it I&rsquo;m just telling you how</p>
<p>to get the nutrients okay I&rsquo;m just the</p>
<p>messenger care right now she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right now with the kidney problem doing</p>
<p>an imminent fasting</p>
<p>probably the best thing for the kidney</p>
<p>you can do to help the kidney and of</p>
<p>course the little car because think</p>
<p>about Karen think about what destroys</p>
<p>the kidney hi sugar so low sugar diets</p>
<p>are good for the kidney okay okay</p>
<p>alright so now I need to go to Randy</p>
<p>from Illinois go ahead Randy hey Dad I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on the keto on the internet fasting and</p>
<p>sometimes I wake up and the new meal I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not hungry but what I do is do a up you</p>
<p>know replacement shake and do your</p>
<p>electrolyte mix with the juice powder</p>
<p>blend those two together we&rsquo;re good then</p>
<p>I take your B vitamins my question is is</p>
<p>it okay to go from one meal of data to</p>
<p>meal a day or should I continue like</p>
<p>with I&rsquo;m not hungry at noon just due to</p>
<p>meal replacement and the electrolytes</p>
<p>and the Jews and would you rather have</p>
<p>me go all the way till five or six and</p>
<p>that do the ID the the shakes for by</p>
<p>nutrition in the afternoon I think you</p>
<p>asked a really good question Randy and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the answer the rule of thumb that</p>
<p>we need to think about is if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry Randy don&rsquo;t eat why because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually in ketosis so as soon as</p>
<p>you eat regardless if it&rsquo;s a protein</p>
<p>shake or whatever or a meal replacement</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to spike insulin so just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ride the wave go as long as till</p>
<p>you can - you&rsquo;re not hungry it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>healthy to do in a minute fasting so</p>
<p>yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t eat something if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry at all now if you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>shake meal replacement just make sure</p>
<p>that you adds a little fat in there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only thing because sometimes</p>
<p>the protein like I have a meal</p>
<p>replacement with MCT oil that&rsquo;s in there</p>
<p>already so adds the fat because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to just a protein powder</p>
<p>strictly so yeah don&rsquo;t eat if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry Randy I&rsquo;m telling you don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>okay now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Sandra from</p>
<p>Southern Maryland had a question about</p>
<p>go ahead yes hi I&rsquo;m guess I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>on whether or not you can have the MCT</p>
<p>oil like a tablespoon if you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>and not eating your first meal till like</p>
<p>noon or 1:00 okay you mean in the coffee</p>
<p>uh yeah I&rsquo;m hoping that I can still have</p>
<p>the coffee with the MCT oil as well as</p>
<p>bone broth even until my first meal at</p>
<p>like noon or 1:00 o&rsquo;clock yeah you can</p>
<p>do that sandrov totally fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working for you great the only only</p>
<p>point I want to bring up about the</p>
<p>bulletproof coffee which you can add MCT</p>
<p>at butter or coconut oil is that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you do this and you plateau and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not losing inches or weight and</p>
<p>your metabolism just sucks okay what you</p>
<p>could do is you can omit the fat in the</p>
<p>coffee and go a little longer because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a meal so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just one point but if you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>losing and everything&rsquo;s going great ride</p>
<p>the wave keep the coffee in there keep</p>
<p>the MCT oils and not a problem and even</p>
<p>the bone broth okay good question all</p>
<p>right Karen have you a question</p>
<p>well odd versus some information because</p>
<p>you know we said someone&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pickled the same as fermented and we</p>
<p>said yes and then someone said no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not so I did a quick search and actually</p>
<p>some pickled is fermented and some</p>
<p>fermented is pickled or whatever but</p>
<p>there is a difference here like a</p>
<p>cucumber is just thrown into a brine but</p>
<p>fermented food really has this bacterial</p>
<p>right action going so just to clarify</p>
<p>for you canning experts out there</p>
<p>fermented vegetables definitely a little</p>
<p>different than pickling well I think</p>
<p>that when you do the bubbies brand pick</p>
<p>that means and also the sauerkraut which</p>
<p>is the best I think you&rsquo;re gonna get a</p>
<p>lot of friendly bacteria in there in</p>
<p>fact Karen yeah if you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>sauerkraut which I love you realize that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting her cup you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>seven hundred milligrams of vitamin C</p>
<p>from from sauerkraut did not realize do</p>
<p>you know what a normal amount</p>
<p>the requirements that you would need</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like 70 to 90 okay so</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re getting 10 times the</p>
<p>vitamin C and sauerkraut Wow well and I</p>
<p>can tell you I&rsquo;ve made sauerkraut before</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the easiest thing on the planet</p>
<p>to make it is literally you throw</p>
<p>something can you make some more later</p>
<p>today you know what every once in a</p>
<p>while I buy the cabbage</p>
<p>and then I I just forget or we use it in</p>
<p>something else but I can do that about a</p>
<p>minute in there</p>
<p>and you literally forget about it great</p>
<p>for the gums it&rsquo;s good for your to your</p>
<p>connective tissue around your teeth and</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s good okay okay so Erica you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Portland Oregon go ahead you&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on hey can I call I am just I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard some a lot of things this morning</p>
<p>that kind of helped a little bit been</p>
<p>doing this since last February I have</p>
<p>lost about 58 pounds and without a</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>I have PCOS and have never been</p>
<p>diagnosed with diabetes but did have one</p>
<p>doctor send me to go have my fasting</p>
<p>blood sugar and insulin done and blood</p>
<p>sugar has never really been too much of</p>
<p>a problem in the past my anyone feel it</p>
<p>comes back totally fine</p>
<p>like 4.8 or something and but the</p>
<p>insulin like spiked and stayed there and</p>
<p>just and she&rsquo;s like okay we definitely</p>
<p>have a problem at that time she just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna have to be diet or medication</p>
<p>what you choose but there&rsquo;s no turn have</p>
<p>to do something with that kind of</p>
<p>insulin problem yeah hey remember what</p>
<p>it is what your insulin was the level I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have a number okay so I do</p>
<p>less than or equal to 25 net carbs a day</p>
<p>and I have lemon juice and a CD in the</p>
<p>morning like prettier it&rsquo;s like early 8</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock boned off with boned off and a</p>
<p>somatic collagen so that&rsquo;s my morning</p>
<p>saying and then</p>
<p>coffee just recently was trying to set</p>
<p>that out a little later in the day like</p>
<p>11:30 because we do put tablespoon of</p>
<p>butter MCT and heavy cream in there</p>
<p>so I figured that might be stalling some</p>
<p>weight loss since I&rsquo;ve only lost about a</p>
<p>little over half of what I need to lose</p>
<p>and then no snacking or anything and</p>
<p>then a small snack sized lunch with</p>
<p>powdered greens and my supplements at</p>
<p>that time and then dinner at 6:30 like</p>
<p>kind of a small snacking lunch with</p>
<p>dinner I didn&rsquo;t know it I thought</p>
<p>possibly develop off in that group oh</p>
<p>the ACV lemon juice was maybe spiking</p>
<p>the blood sugar</p>
<p>I took it recently I just laughs this</p>
<p>week last week and numbers that were</p>
<p>crazy I&rsquo;m fasting one 146 in the morning</p>
<p>81 before taking anything and then 129</p>
<p>this week and then I decided to that was</p>
<p>after 13 hours of fasting from dinner</p>
<p>and then total 8 o&rsquo;clock and then I</p>
<p>waited that whole day and didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything at all I think I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>remember if I did my bone broth and the</p>
<p>ACD but I didn&rsquo;t have the vault copy to</p>
<p>a mints I checked at 4 o&rsquo;clock and it</p>
<p>was still at 118 okay so I&rsquo;m gonna give</p>
<p>one hour yeah alright this is a really</p>
<p>good question because here you are</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s going great but but they</p>
<p>checked your insulin is high and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you I think the majority of the</p>
<p>population has high insulin and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the thing that&rsquo;s behind the scene</p>
<p>because doctors never check it high</p>
<p>insulin will will push the sugars down</p>
<p>and make it even look low or normal</p>
<p>sometimes too depending what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>but the fact that you&rsquo;ve been on this</p>
<p>for a year and it&rsquo;s still or it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>we have nothing to compare it to them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do a little bit</p>
<p>stricter in a minute fasting to go to</p>
<p>probably go to one and a half or one</p>
<p>meals a day</p>
<p>one meal a day ok and the reason for</p>
<p>that is in a minute fasting will</p>
<p>definitely drop your insulin down</p>
<p>faster than anything so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to work up to the bone</p>
<p>broth is a bit of protein only have that</p>
<p>with the meal as part of your protein</p>
<p>the other thing that you would do is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two trace minerals zinc and</p>
<p>chromium both of those minerals are</p>
<p>really awesome to help support the</p>
<p>pancreas and help reduce instance so</p>
<p>those are two things you might want to</p>
<p>add to the mix but yeah you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to go strict with your fasting and</p>
<p>then do that for like a month and then</p>
<p>recheck it and it should come down if</p>
<p>not call me alright very good and Karen</p>
<p>yeah what we&rsquo;re gonna do is we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to reveal right now the best nut and</p>
<p>then at the very end we&rsquo;ll release the</p>
<p>best berry so I so we&rsquo;re gonna split</p>
<p>this up so I want everyone to type down</p>
<p>what you think the absolute best nut to</p>
<p>consume on a ketogenic diet would be</p>
<p>okay so as people are typing that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to J Fort Lauderdale you had a</p>
<p>question about berberine</p>
<p>right berberine berberine yeah I made</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s me oh yeah just give you a</p>
<p>little background on them you know</p>
<p>forty-year-old pretty healthy you know</p>
<p>bodybuilder you know below 10% body fat</p>
<p>I work out regularly cardio and lifting</p>
<p>weights and lately it becoming a lot of</p>
<p>issues with high blood sugars I measure</p>
<p>it daily by blood is under 120 to 130 I</p>
<p>have a history of family diabetes so</p>
<p>basically what I did about a month ago</p>
<p>as I fasted for five days a straight</p>
<p>water fast and would jump right into</p>
<p>into a ketogenic diet informating which</p>
<p>I only eat between the hours of 12 8 and</p>
<p>then 16 hour break I&rsquo;m still having a</p>
<p>hard time getting my sugar levels down</p>
<p>so I was wondering how long in your</p>
<p>experience does it take for you to</p>
<p>experience a drop in your blood sugars</p>
<p>because I have a feeling that I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>maybe becoming a type 2 diabetic somehow</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if because of use of</p>
<p>human growth hormone that I use</p>
<p>regularly and HGH at a very low dose</p>
<p>about two units a day so I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>why my blood sugar levels are not</p>
<p>and I still have ketones because I do I</p>
<p>do mention in my blood every day and I</p>
<p>mean ketosis but my blood sugar levels</p>
<p>are still high so question what is your</p>
<p>sugar what is the level the levels are</p>
<p>in the range between 120 to 130 okay</p>
<p>every morning fasted okay with ketones</p>
<p>in the past when I did a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>they will go down to the 50s 60s but now</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t seem to get them down and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking chromium picolinate and</p>
<p>taking alpha lipoic acid the art form as</p>
<p>well to assist with that and I sometimes</p>
<p>take berberine which is a natural</p>
<p>alternative to metformin when I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a meal and I probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy like a glass of wine or just like</p>
<p>a small piece of car like a small piece</p>
<p>of bread I usually take the berberine</p>
<p>before the meal which I understand it</p>
<p>helps with the controlling the sugar</p>
<p>levels after a meal okay Jay I think I</p>
<p>know the problem okay are you sitting</p>
<p>down okay good I am good it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>alcohol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the snack it&rsquo;s a little bit of</p>
<p>bread that you&rsquo;re eating the Bourbon is</p>
<p>not strong enough to counter that</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s the thing if you consume</p>
<p>a little bit of the wrong thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna raise insulin insulin is the</p>
<p>dominating hormone let&rsquo;s say you have</p>
<p>berberine or or some other thing to try</p>
<p>to counter it this is dominating insulin</p>
<p>is dominating so all it takes is a</p>
<p>little bit of the negative to drowned</p>
<p>out all the good so if you really are</p>
<p>serious about getting a blood Sugar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>down you&rsquo;re gonna have to be a hundred</p>
<p>percent clean no little snacks no</p>
<p>alcohol no little anything okay and then</p>
<p>if it still doesn&rsquo;t work right away J</p>
<p>all that means is you need to do it</p>
<p>longer because you&rsquo;ve been on for a</p>
<p>short bit of time you just ride the wave</p>
<p>sometimes it takes a few months before</p>
<p>it kicks in and then you can stay on</p>
<p>that very consistently so that&rsquo;s all you</p>
<p>need to do yeah there are different</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even like go through and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different herbs and plants that you can</p>
<p>take but I would work go to the basics</p>
<p>first before you start adding all these</p>
<p>other things okay get the diet cleaned</p>
<p>really good but thanks for calling and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good important point and</p>
<p>Karen what kind of answers are we</p>
<p>getting we are primarily getting pecan</p>
<p>walnut macadamia someone threw into some</p>
<p>seeds here which isn&rsquo;t really a nut but</p>
<p>sunflower seeds but those are the three</p>
<p>okay yeah so first thing I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you Karen is the worst nut oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the cashew those are so yummy the net</p>
<p>the net carb on that is like in the 20s</p>
<p>there one nut ya know in a cup cup yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of nuts I know I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>telling you it relatively speaking must</p>
<p>be less yes between 20 and 30 I I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell you the exact number but okay the</p>
<p>point is that the cashew is the worst</p>
<p>nut the best nut hands-down that has the</p>
<p>lowest carb and a good amount of fat is</p>
<p>the drumroll pecan bomb yeah so pecan is</p>
<p>the winner</p>
<p>okay okay and in just a couple minutes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do the next one the best</p>
<p>berry okay state - yeah this is unlike</p>
<p>edge of my seat right yeah I&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>yeah okay so now you guys can answer the</p>
<p>question while I&rsquo;m gonna have like talk</p>
<p>to this person try to type back what is</p>
<p>the absolute hands-down best berry you</p>
<p>can eat and I&rsquo;m gonna let you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re correct okay okay now let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Jenn you&rsquo;ve been on hold for 23 minutes</p>
<p>go ahead Jim and it was worth every</p>
<p>minute can you hear me yes okay I love</p>
<p>you but don&rsquo;t be quick to it so somebody</p>
<p>else can get in and I think with you</p>
<p>answered Randy&rsquo;s call it kind of</p>
<p>answered my question but it&rsquo;s far as me</p>
<p>being on keto and not having an appetite</p>
<p>I am concerned about getting my</p>
<p>nutrition in right and I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>I mean I have bought all your products</p>
<p>my husband makes fun of me it looks like</p>
<p>the doctor Berg store in my kitchen</p>
<p>and then I felt like I was taking too</p>
<p>many pills so I&rsquo;m wondering if I could</p>
<p>just use your meal replacement shakes</p>
<p>and the kale shakes and then just kind</p>
<p>of dump the vitamins in the shake will</p>
<p>that help me get the nutrition that I</p>
<p>need or is it safe to just literally not</p>
<p>eat okay well here&rsquo;s the thing you can</p>
<p>take the nutrition on an empty stomach</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to take it with meals did</p>
<p>you know that no there&rsquo;s a lot of it</p>
<p>says take with your meal get all these</p>
<p>items in I know I probably I should have</p>
<p>clarified that so you can take them on</p>
<p>an empty stomach not a problem I</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t want you to do a meal</p>
<p>replacement to take put them in there I</p>
<p>just want you to do that do the</p>
<p>nutrients and again if you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat I think I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great I don&rsquo;t think you just that you</p>
<p>know people have this idea they have to</p>
<p>have excuse me just take nutrients with</p>
<p>food but the only time you do that as</p>
<p>maybe with the gall bladder formula and</p>
<p>the digestive formula those two right</p>
<p>there because that actually acidified</p>
<p>sturino I have your adrenal kit okay</p>
<p>okay so you Tim you have the gall</p>
<p>bladder formula so you would just take</p>
<p>that after your one meal and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good so you don&rsquo;t to take that other</p>
<p>than that I think you do just one meal</p>
<p>or two meal I&rsquo;d have to do like a 16-8</p>
<p>because I really just don&rsquo;t have an</p>
<p>appetite I can&rsquo;t force it all in and in</p>
<p>a short period so this I kind of been</p>
<p>relying on the shakes and then I add</p>
<p>some MCT oil and maybe try to get like</p>
<p>two hard-boiled eggs down with it just</p>
<p>to kind of keep my fat out but literally</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get seven cups of salad</p>
<p>but by time I&rsquo;m in my second cup I feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna get sick of eight one</p>
<p>more bite so yeah I know I know don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>force it do as much as you can and I</p>
<p>think with the extra enhancement is</p>
<p>probably going to compensate fine but I</p>
<p>really like to what&rsquo;s really easy for me</p>
<p>as I blend the kale you just put some of</p>
<p>this or even the wheatgrass juice in</p>
<p>there blend the kale and you could</p>
<p>liquefy that kale and drink it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easier and go right in there and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good for the you know half of the day</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>but yeah that&rsquo;s a situation but the</p>
<p>other thing that Karen is doing now</p>
<p>which is a great idea by the way for</p>
<p>your salads pork rinds man I had it the</p>
<p>other day that was really good</p>
<p>so yeah so I want to explain this right</p>
<p>so we what were we putting on that was</p>
<p>so good you well the feta cheat you put</p>
<p>the cheese you put the what else you had</p>
<p>a little nuts on there you had yeah</p>
<p>onion well over the holiday we had that</p>
<p>onion the organic onions draw or</p>
<p>whatever from wherever we got it and</p>
<p>that have very very low carbon I would</p>
<p>put it on just as a little crunchy you</p>
<p>know I do knots and stuff like that</p>
<p>slivered really tiny nuts and ran out of</p>
<p>that and we ended up with some pork</p>
<p>rinds and I thought you know what I just</p>
<p>gonna crunch these up a bit and sprinkle</p>
<p>them on my salad and I&rsquo;m on tell you it</p>
<p>was really good I was surprised it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good yeah and make sure you get</p>
<p>the no MSG pork rinds put some salt on</p>
<p>there actually it&rsquo;s already salted yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite good yeah it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>nice little flavor and some fat yeah so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like you eat you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>normally like eating large salads but</p>
<p>you even told me that you would I wish I</p>
<p>could have another salad well I did have</p>
<p>another salad you did but you know</p>
<p>another thing too for people who are</p>
<p>trying to get more salad in maybe are</p>
<p>already doing this but this was a trick</p>
<p>for me because I felt the same way I</p>
<p>mean obviously you know I started</p>
<p>blending a lot of my green so I would do</p>
<p>maybe four or five cups of greens just</p>
<p>in my kale shake but for this salad when</p>
<p>I was getting used to eating that much</p>
<p>salad they have these great they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>scissors sort of that chop up your</p>
<p>lettuce and it just makes them into much</p>
<p>smaller pieces and out of for me it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot easier to eat a lot more greens you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like half the volume once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done chopping it and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>tip but it might help you yeah and also</p>
<p>one ounce equals one cup so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking a bag is five maybe it could be</p>
<p>five to eight cups but here&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>thing here</p>
<p>when you</p>
<p>consuming salad yeah okay versus other</p>
<p>vegetables yeah you need less vegetables</p>
<p>per salad with just salad that again</p>
<p>if you just have salad you&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>more salad if you have only vegetables</p>
<p>you could get by with less so you might</p>
<p>be like yeah you can probably get by</p>
<p>with like 5 cups of vegetable verses 8</p>
<p>to 10 cups of salad they&rsquo;re kind of the</p>
<p>same kind of a comparison with nutrition</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit more nutrition than</p>
<p>vegetables than they&rsquo;re just regular</p>
<p>salad I mean the thing is though you</p>
<p>know when I eat vegetables usually I</p>
<p>cook them lightly I mean unless it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>green peppers or something like that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna have 5 cups of raw Brussels</p>
<p>sprouts I&rsquo;m gonna cook them what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with that Karen well I don&rsquo;t know no</p>
<p>yeah of course not you&rsquo;re gonna I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about like green beans and bell</p>
<p>peppers and that&rsquo;s still yeah yeah so</p>
<p>just a tip is that - okay I have some</p>
<p>questions it&rsquo;s been a while since you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come to us in social media Lee go ahead</p>
<p>okay good so I have oh do you want to</p>
<p>know about the berries or not yet no</p>
<p>yeah Karen okay that&rsquo;s the last question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a last question yeah fair enough</p>
<p>fair enough okay so I have a couple of</p>
<p>here we have Ross from YouTube and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying that after his breakfast in the</p>
<p>morning when his sugar Rises it</p>
<p>manifests for him as anxiety and it</p>
<p>lasts about 45 minutes and that has been</p>
<p>happening for the last almost a month 24</p>
<p>days so he wants to know what can he do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a adrenal issue because what</p>
<p>happens when the blood sugars start</p>
<p>dropping the adrenals compensate and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to bring up this sugar to</p>
<p>bring up the for the loss of sugar so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really and then you experience a</p>
<p>little adrenaline adrenal symptoms</p>
<p>shakiness and all these other symptoms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening so what</p>
<p>you have to do and I did a video on this</p>
<p>you have to go about it a little bit</p>
<p>slower back up a little bit maybe you</p>
<p>start with 3</p>
<p>instead of two or two meals instead of</p>
<p>one support your dream get more sleep go</p>
<p>for long walks do acupressure on the</p>
<p>adrenals with this device here I have a</p>
<p>whole technique and then the other thing</p>
<p>that you can do is add the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast at the meal or even during the</p>
<p>that sensation so that will actually</p>
<p>calm it down pretty nice and of course</p>
<p>potassium but mainly would be vitamins</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really an adrenal issue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all it is and over time that will</p>
<p>improve it will give it more time okay</p>
<p>okay good good so on Facebook Beverly is</p>
<p>freezing all the time now she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say is she on keto or doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I can only assume but regardless</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s freezing all the time well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because number one she lives in Alaska</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s winter and she left her coat</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the reason so just</p>
<p>wear more clothes okay you probably</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t gonna been a fast and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting colder so that&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>adaptational tabal ism is adjusting so I</p>
<p>would just in the meantime</p>
<p>ride the wave it will get better over</p>
<p>time but on an occasion it could be the</p>
<p>adrenal because there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>the sympathetic nervous system that gets</p>
<p>activated with the adrenal that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underneath the whole thing and sometimes</p>
<p>that could make you feel really cold on</p>
<p>your feet in your fingers in which case</p>
<p>you have to support the adrenals with</p>
<p>nutrition I have a lot of videos on that</p>
<p>but yeah oh let&rsquo;s make that point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s videos on everything literally I</p>
<p>mean other than the really technical</p>
<p>individual questions there is a video on</p>
<p>pretty much every question that&rsquo;s asked</p>
<p>either in the lab group or on these live</p>
<p>shows and the phone calls lots of videos</p>
<p>already done on things so the YouTube</p>
<p>and Facebook you have links above or</p>
<p>below they don&rsquo;t so type anything in</p>
<p>order to type anything just click the</p>
<p>link now if you click that link right</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s going to take you outside of</p>
<p>the live show so that you can get this</p>
<p>summary of videos which is a male</p>
<p>using that this has been organized and</p>
<p>compiled into one document but you come</p>
<p>come right back then yeah so now I need</p>
<p>Lisa&rsquo;s been on the call so Lisa you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Virginia Beach go ahead yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a question I&rsquo;ve been on the keto</p>
<p>diet for the past year and my 13 year</p>
<p>old daughter she also is on it but I</p>
<p>said never to come back and she has high</p>
<p>cholesterol yeah and I was saying I know</p>
<p>that you said about this the fat and the</p>
<p>cholesterol in the cell yeah and the</p>
<p>cholesterol doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere or</p>
<p>something I want to exist the wrong diet</p>
<p>for her is the cholesterol just push the</p>
<p>lower but she&rsquo;s not losing any weight</p>
<p>either how old is she I don&rsquo;t thirteen</p>
<p>thirteen in does she have a lot of</p>
<p>weight to lose about thirty pounds okay</p>
<p>is she is she doing the keto correctly</p>
<p>and is she doing in a minute fasting</p>
<p>well if she does in a minute fasting</p>
<p>like today she carried him with her she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t need any breakfast so mate I was</p>
<p>sleep plus I think he&rsquo;s at 11 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>maybe 12 or 13 hours of fasting because</p>
<p>he is she doing best a lot of bags and</p>
<p>or salad well we we salad that in easy</p>
<p>time every two cups of salad you know 13</p>
<p>years and I don&rsquo;t eat too many</p>
<p>vegetables anyway yeah so I try to get</p>
<p>her to eat like you know a couple</p>
<p>couplers you know vegetables in the</p>
<p>evening time got it other than that you</p>
<p>know we eggs and bacon doing this you</p>
<p>know weekend and I&rsquo;m not sure it is too</p>
<p>much you know cholesterol huge yeah you</p>
<p>know here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>I want you to I want you and her to go</p>
<p>the YouTube and type under the</p>
<p>cholesterol dr. Burke and just watch</p>
<p>those videos because you need all you</p>
<p>need the whole picture</p>
<p>but as she&rsquo;s losing the cholesterol I</p>
<p>mean the fat from the fat cell part of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be cholesterol so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to increase initially it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>bad thing it has to come out but if she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the amount of vegetables it</p>
<p>might stay up higher it&rsquo;s not an issue</p>
<p>because the type of cholesterol is</p>
<p>probably the type that is more</p>
<p>called fluffy or buoyant type a</p>
<p>cholesterol which watch the videos</p>
<p>understand what that means it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going through the body but the whole</p>
<p>goal is to drop the carbs down so then</p>
<p>the cholesterol can come out so she</p>
<p>needs to do maybe the kale shake to get</p>
<p>to start cleaning it out better but and</p>
<p>then she should start noticing the</p>
<p>clothes start shrinking and less hungry</p>
<p>and less craving for sweets okay so do</p>
<p>that Lisa and then let us know next next</p>
<p>week how it how it goes okay so now can</p>
